<TEXT>
   President George Sokomanu was arrested
on Wednesday and charged with inciting mutiny in a deepening
political crisis in this South Pacific state, the Australian
Associated Press news agency reported.
   Sokomanu faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and the
agency quoted Public Prosecutor John Baxter-Wright as saying
additional charges would be levied against him.
   On Tuesday, Parliament acted to remove Sokomanu from office for
his failed attempt two days earlier to form an interim government
pending national elections in February. Legislators accused him of
treason, gross misconduct and other major offenses.
   Sokomanu tried last Friday to dissolve Parliament and to dismiss
elected Prime Minister Walter Lini and replace with Sokomanu's
nephew, flamboyant, Australian-educated politician Barak Sope. Lini
has been in power since Vanuatu, formerly known as the New Hebrides
and under Anglo-French rule, became independent in 1980.
   The AAP said the president was charged during a five-minute
appearance at Port Vila Magistrate's Court.
   It said Senior Magistrate Dawn Barcinski asked the president if
he had anything to say, and he replied: ``Your Honor, I would like
to see my lawyer first.''
   The president, clad in a sport shirt and shorts, waved to
spectators as he walked from the court and was led away to a police
vehicle, guarded by about 12 uniformed officers, the AAP said.
   Four members of the abortive interim government, including Sope,
already have been charged with sedition.
   All five men are scheduled to apply for bail later Wednesday
before the Supreme Court.
   The crisis culminates a yearlong power struggle between Lini and
Sope, whose foes blamed him for recent outbreaks of violence in his
bid for leadership.
   This island nation of 130,000 people lies 1,200 miles northeast
of Brisbane, Australia.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Says Joe Kennedy Tussled With Him After Near-Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager complained to police that Rep. Joseph
P. Kennedy II pushed him Tuesday and struck his head against a car
after the two were involved in a near-collision, but the youth later
said he would drop charges.
   Victor H. Avila, 17, said he would not pursue his complaint
against Kennedy because the congressman had apologized. Avila said
he was not hurt. Avila said he filed assault and battery charges in
Brighton District Court Tuesday but would drop them Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Kennedy came over to my house and he apologized and I
accepted his apology,'' Avila said in a telephone interview Tuesday
evening.
   A spokesman for Kennedy, Jim Mahoney, said Kennedy had sternly
reprimanded the teen-ager for speeding after the near-accident but
had not hit him.
   He said Kennedy visited the teen-ager later to ``clarify
matters'' but that he did not apologize for anything. Mahoney could
not say whether Kennedy had pushed Avila.
   Kennedy, 36, was elected last month to his second term in
Congress. He is the eldest son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy and a
nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy and of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy.
   Boston police spokesman Tom Santry said Avila filed a complaint
saying that he was driving up a hill in the city's Brighton
neighborhood about 12:40 p.m. Tuesday and passed Kennedy's car. Both
drivers veered off the road to avoid a collision, the complaint said.
   ``Both parties got out of their cars and the suspect then grabbed
the victim and pushed him into the victim's car,'' Avila's complaint
said. ``The victim's head hit the car.''
   Santry said police would not pursue such as case unless Avila
filed a complaint in court, and he could confirm only that a
complaint was filed at the police station.
   Mahoney said that as the father of two young boys who play in the
neighborhood, Kennedy was upset at the sight of the speeding car.
Mahoney said Avila's car forced the congressman's off the road.
   ``Joe gave a very stern reprimand to the young man driving the
other vehicle,'' Mahoney said. He said the boy and his father later
met with Kennedy. ``After hearing Joe's side, the father and the son
were going to withdraw the complaint,'' Mahoney said.
   A man answering the telephone at the boy's home said he was
Avila's father but would not comment and would not give his name.

   Most New Yorkers have low opinions of their
schools, subways, public safety and race relations _ but they would
overwhelmingly recommend the city as a place to live, according to a
survey released Tuesday.
   The survey by the City University of New York found 64 percent of
those interviewed were dissatisfied with street safety, 60 percent
with the subways, 55 percent with the public schools and just over
50 percent with race relations.
   But 77 percent would recommend the city to a friend and more than
80 percent would recommend their neighborhoods.
   In unveiling some preliminary findings, the university's graduate
school said the survey was the first of what will be an annual poll
about the makeup of the city that can be used for guidance by
government and private policy makers.
   It would help bridge the 10-year gap between federal censuses and
go beyond the census by including such data as religion and
attitudes about social and political issues, the university said.
   Survey takers conducted telephone interviews in English or
Spanish with 1,470 adult residents of the city during the summer and
fall. They reported a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
three percentage points.
   Some other findings of the survey:
   _Sixty percent of the respondents grew up in homes where
languages other than English were spoken.
   _Seventy percent want the city to spend more on bilingual
education and a like percentage go along with legal abortion.
   _Three out of 10 know someone who has AIDS or AIDS-related
complex.

   Max Robinson, who became the first black news
anchorman on American network television but soon saw his life beset
by personal and professional problems, died Tuesday from
complications of AIDS. He was 49.
   Robinson started his broadcasting career as a disc jockey in
Richmond, Va. He moved to Washington in 1965.
   In 1978, Robinson left Washington television station WTOP, where
he had won top ratings as an anchorman for a decade, to join ABC as
the first black to anchor a network news show. He co-anchored the
ABC Evening News from Chicago with Peter Jennings in London and
Frank Reynolds in Washington.
   Robinson's tenure at ABC was troubled as he zealously waged a
battle against racism at the network. He charged the network with
racism in a speech at Smith College in 1981.
   After Reynolds' death in 1983, Jennings was made sole anchor of
the newscasts, and Robinson was relegated to weekend anchor stints
and news briefs. In 1984, he joined Chicago television station WMAQ.

<HEAD>Brady Bunch Reunion Pulls CBS Out Of Ratings' Cellar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``A Very Brady Christmas,'' CBS' reunion of the
1970s sitcom family that lived on ABC, was this season's top-rated
made-for-TV movie and gave CBS a Christmas gift _ a break from third
place in the ratings.
   It was the first time this season that CBS finished out of last
place.
   NBC won the week, and ``The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1, the A.C.
Nielsen Co. said.
   But ``A Very Brady Christmas,'' broadcast Sunday, was last week's
No. 2 prime-time show, with a 25.1 rating and a 39 share, lifting
CBS to second place over ABC, where ``The Brady Bunch'' ran from
1969-1974.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC;
``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``L.A. Law,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,''
CBS; and ``Dear John,'' NBC, tied with ``60 Minutes,'' CBS.
   NBC's average prime-time rating last week was 15.4. CBS had 13.1
and ABC 11.8.
   ``ABC World News Tonight'' won the close news race with an
average rating of 11.0 and a 20 share. ``NBC Nightly News'' got out
of third, possibly due to anchorman Tom Brokaw's travels to Armenia
and Geneva, and had a 10.9 and 20, edging the ``CBS Evening News,''
with a 10.7 and 19.
   NBC's ``Midnight Caller'' episode that drew fire from homosexual
rights groups because of its storyline about a man with AIDS
purposely engaging in high-risk sex, ranked 33rd, about what it has
been ranking this season.
   Jerry Lewis began a guest-star stint on CBS' ``Wiseguy,''
boosting the crime drama to 32nd place.
   The lowest-rated network shows last week were: ``Davy Crockett,''
``Mission Impossible,'' ``Moscow Circus,'' ``Annie McGuire,'' ``West
57th,'' ``Simon & Simon,'' ``TV 101,'' ``Murphy's Law,''
``Knightwatch'' and ``Burning Issues.''

<HEAD>Judge Effectively Cuts Gay Rights Issue From Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has rejected the American Civil
Liberties Union's bid to join a lawsuit over the forced cancellation
of the 1988 Gay Rodeo National Championship, effectively removing
gay rights as an issue in the dispute.
   In denying the ACLU's motion, the judge determined the issue that
has pitted conservative residents against homosexual organizers was
not civil rights, said Churchill County District Attorney Kevin
Pasquale.
   ``There was an effort to make this some kind of gay rights forum.
They wanted to turn this into a three-ring circus. But it didn't
work. The judge said the ACLU can't play,'' Pasquale said.
   Shelly Chase, executive director of the Nevada ACLU, said her
group was giving up despite the outcome of Monday's hearing before
District Judge Archie Blake in Fallon.
   ``We're still trying to come up with a way to get involved,'' Ms.
Chase said. ``We just have to prove that discrimination occurred ...
that there was an effort to try to keep an unpopular group out by
using laws that are too broadly applied.''
   The National Gay Rodeo championship was canceled in mid-October
just days before its scheduled opening after Blake signed a
temporary injunction preventing the event from being held at a
private Fallon arena.
   The 20-acre Stockman's Arena was leased from owner David Lantry
after the International Gay Rodeo Association had been turned away
by public arenas in Reno, Virginia City and Fallon.
   In granting the temporary injunction, Blake agreed with the
county, saying the health and safety of the community was at stake
because of expected crowds of up to 1,000 that would strain police
and emergency services.
   Blake said the rodeo organizers also did not have the proper
county license for the event.
   The judge's decision was upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court,
which said the case did not raise questions of homosexual rights or
freedom of expression.
   County officials acted to halt the rodeo after about 50 Fallon
residents presented them with a petition signed by 1,519 people who
didn't want the event in their community.
   The county is seeking a permanent injunction to block future
rodeos on Lantry's property because officials claim it is not large
enough or properly equipped. Lantry, with the help of ACLU
attorneys, is fighting the permanent injunction.
   Blake set a May 17-19 trial on the issue after denying
ACLU-backed motions, including one to move the case from Fallon.
   Ms. Chase said appeals would likely follow and the gay rodeo
association was expected to seek damages from the county for more
than $20,000 in losses because of the cancellation.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Deficit Panel Still Shaky, Despite Bush Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush has made his appointments
for the final two spots on the National Economic Commission, but
doubts persist over how successful the panel will be in breaking a
seven-year deadlock over the budget deficit.
   The high-level commission was created to help the new president
deal with President Reagan's biggest economic failure, huge budget
deficits that have more than doubled the national debt.
   On Tuesday, Bush announced he was choosing former Sen. Paul
Laxalt, R-Nev., and former Ohio Congressman Thomas ``Lud'' Ashley, a
Democrat and one of Bush's closest friends.
   Under law, Bush was required to pick one Democrat and one
Republican to complete the 14-member commission, which is headed by
Democrat Robert Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis.
   Supporters once believed the bipartisan panel represented the
best hope of breaking the impasse between Reagan's opposition to tax
increases and the Democratic Congress's refusal to trim domestic
spending enough to tame the budget deficit.
   But even with the appointments, many observers said the
commission faces a nearly impossible task of reaching a consensus
among panel members who have squabbled openly over such issues as
taxes and the need to trim defense spending.
   ``What Bush has done is give the commission a renewed look of
respectability, but the members are a long way from reaching a
consensus on a credible plan that Bush and Congress will accept,''
said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm that bears
his name.
   The commission once had hoped to complete its work before
Christmas but Lewis has said the panel may not issue its
recommendations until next September.
   At that time, the panel could serve as an emergency vehicle which
Bush could use to throw together a compromise with Congress in order
to avoid automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   But Strauss said Tuesday that he hoped the commission would try
to meet a March 1 deadline specified in the law creating the panel.
The law did provide an escape clause that would allow the new
president to delay the report until Sept. 1.
   The commission has scheduled 16 days of hearings in January and
February to begin making decisions on a deficit-cutting plan even
though those sessions have been clouded by a court battle over
whether the commission can deliberate in secret.
   During the campaign, Bush had derided the commission as a
stalking horse for tax increases, something he has pledged
repeatedly he will not accept.
   But in making his announcements Tuesday, he tempered his earlier
skepticism, noting that he had named Ashley and Laxalt one day after
the Electoral College ratified the Nov. 8 vote electing him
president.
   ``The swiftness with which I am making these appointments
underscores the importance I place on the need to reduce the federal
budget deficit,'' Bush said.
   Ashley's appointment had been expected, but the choice of Laxalt
was a surprise and came after Bush apparently rejected the advice of
some aides that he select Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon, who as a
ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee in the 1970s had
gained a reputation as a political pragmatist.
   By picking Laxalt over Bellmon, some observers said Bush decided
to go with more of a hardliner against taxes to insure that his
``no-new-tax'' pledge is adhered to.
   ``From everything I know about him, he would be against taxes and
would want to look on the spending side for deficit reductions,''
said Richard Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Rahn is a leading anti-tax supply sider who had been considered
as a possible choice for the commission himself.
   The other 12 members of the commission, evenly split between
Democrats and Republicans, were appointed by congressional leaders
and Reagan.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass., said Bush made the appointments Tuesday in order to reassure
financial markets of his seriousness in cutting the budget deficit.
But he said it remains to be seen how seriously the president-elect
will take the panel's findings.
   ``The suspicion is that regardless of what the commission says,
Bush will ignore it,'' Wyss said.

   President Roh Tae-woo's government
freed 281 political prisoners throughout South Korea on Wednesday
and restored the civil rights of 1,581 others in a sweeping amnesty
to restore political peace.
   Justice Ministry officials said prison terms of 92 other
political prisoners were reduced and 61 radical students were
removed from police wanted lists.
   The government ordered the amnesty involving 2,015 of what it
called ``politically motivated offenders'' as part of efforts to
defuse a nationwide furor over demands that former President Chun
Doo-hwan be punished for human rights abuses and corruption under
his authoritarian regime.
   Roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive Chun and
promised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measures
to wipe out vestiges of Chun's government. Roh, a former general and
ally of Chun, has pledged to introduce full democracy.
   Dissident groups accused Roh of betraying his promise to free all
political prisoners and claimed about 300 remained in jail.
   Justice officials said 224 ``anti-state criminals'' still were
behind bars, but said nearly all were Communist North Korean spies
or dissidents convicted of violent crimes.
   The main political opposition parties welcomed the amnesty. They
had frequently demanded such action as a way toward national
reconciliation and democracy, but said they would still press for
action against Chun.
   Among those released Wednesday were Kim Hyun-jang and Moon
Boo-shik. Each was serving a 20-year term for leading a raid on the
U.S. cultural center in Pusan. One person died and three were hurt
when the center was set afire in the protest over U.S. support for
the Chun government.
   Kim Tae-kun, a leading dissident who won the Robert Kennedy Human
Rights Award this year, had his civil rights restored. Kim, who was
released last June, drew five years in 1986 on charges of
overthrowing the government and spreading pro-North Korean
propaganda.
   Kim claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture.
   Justice Ministry officials said the amnesty was the second since
Roh succeeded Chun last Feb. 25 and involved the largest number of
political offenders in a single amnesty.

   A senior diplomat who served as anti-fraud officer
at the U.S. Embassy in Spain was sentenced Tuesday to five years in
federal prison after pleading guilty in a scheme to illegally sell
visas to Iranian nationals.
   Bernard J. Fennell, former first secretary and consul in Madrid,
was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lenore C. Nesbitt on conspiracy
and fraud charges.
   Fennell, other American citizens and Iranian nationals were
accused of conspiring to unlawfully sell visas to Iranians wanting
to emigrate to the United States. Many of the Iranians had already
been rejected for visas, or were otherwise ineligible to obtain them.
   As much as $5,000 was paid for a single visa, and $15,000 bought
visas for a family of five, according to the indictment.
   Fennell's alleged co-conspirators, visa broker Harry Arjad and
his associate Mary Rosales, traveled to West Germany, Turkey and
Israel collecting passports and money from Iranian nationals, said
Dexter Lehtinen, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.
   Those passports were then taken to Fennell at the embassy, who
would issue non-immigrant visas to the Iranians without the required
documentation and personal interviews, Lehtinen said.
   Fennell, who was the embassy's anti-fraud officer and supervised
visa operations, also falsified information on the visa applications
and on confidential outgoing cables to other U.S. embassies to
justify the illegal visas, Lehtinen said.
   The indictment listed 12 sales that took place in Frankfurt, Tel
Aviv and Istanbul between July and December 1986.
   Some of the Iranian aliens who tried to enter the United Sates
have pleaded guilty in the case. Fennell has since resigned from the
State Department.

heart with a double bypass, doctors said.
   ``His surgery went fine,'' said Dr. Robert Hardin, who helped
perform the operation. ``There was no evidence of any damage to his
heart.''
   Doctors have not said when Cash may be moved out of intensive
care or when he may be released, according to hospital spokeswoman
Debby Koch.
   Jennings, 51, who had a triple bypass a week ago, was moved into
a private room over the weekend and doctors hope he will be home for
Christmas, Ms. Koch said.

   A love story written by Pope John Paul II,
starring Burt Lancaster and featuring three marriages but only one
kiss, has been previewed by an audience at the Vatican.
   ``The Jeweler's Shop,'' the motion picture version of a play
written by John Paul in 1960 when he was Karol Wojtyla, the Bishop
of Krakow, was shown to 7,000 guests at the Vatican's Paul VI Hall
Monday night.
   Directed by Michael Anderson (``Around the World in 80 Days''),
the film is devoid of sexual tension except for the lone kiss
between Teresa (Olivia Hussey) and Andrew (Andrew Occhipinti) after
he proposes.
   The film recounts the three intertwined love stories of two young
couples in war-torn 1939 Poland and their oldest children,
Christopher and Monica, who later fall in love.
   A jeweler, played by Lancaster, sells the lovers their wedding
rings, and a priest named Adam (Daniel Olbrychski) performs each
marriage and counsels the couples through their hardships.
   ``Nothing takes up more space on the surface of life than love,''
Adam says, ``and nothing is more unknown and mysterious.''
   Made in English and dubbed into Italian, French and German, the
movie is scheduled for international release in February.
   The play, which was peformed on Italian radio in 1979, a year
after the author became pope, has been translated into 15 languages.
The only other published play written by a man who would become pope
was ``History of Two Lovers'' by Enea Silvio Piccolomini, who was
crowned Pope Pius II in 1458.

   Actor Gary Busey continues to walk and take
other forms of exercise as part of his recuperation from a
near-fatal motorcycle accident two weeks ago, a hospital spokesman
said.
   ``All the indications are that he is going to make a total
recovery,'' said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ron Wise.
   ``His condition is still listed as fair. He still needs to be
watched. He had a very serious accident,'' Wise said.
   Busey, 44, had brain surgery after he hit his head on a curb Dec.
4 when he fell from the motorcycle he was riding without a helmet.
Police blamed Busey for the accident, but said no charges would be
filed.

   Robert Urich, who has played action heroes on
``Vegas'' and ``Spenser: For Hire,'' expects to shift gears and play
a Charles Kuralt-type character next season in an NBC series from
the producers of ``Family Ties.''
   The half-hour show, tentatively titled ``American Dreamer,'' was
inspired by an hour-long episode of ``Family Ties'' in which Michael
J. Fox stood on a darkened soundstage and harked back to various
incidents in his life.
   ``We're going to constantly break the fourth wall, and if I had
to describe it briefly, it'd be `Our Town' for television,'' Urich
said in a recent interview.
   Urich described his character as ``kind of a writer, like a (CBS
newsman) Charles Kuralt guy, trying to get back in touch with
America and his sense of America and belonging there, but trying to
live in the '90s.''

   A 17-year-old girl struggling to recover from
a shooting accident that required the amputation of her leg just
above the knee got some unexpected encouragement from Sen.-elect Bob
Kerrey.
   Kerrey, whose leg was amputated below the knee after he was
wounded in Vietnam, called Lana Gillming after hearing of her
accident.
   ``I notice those sorts of things,'' the Democratic senator-elect
and former governor said. ``I just told her I've got a lot of
feeling for her and that I am her friend.''
   ``He said he would be a real friend and gave me his telephone
number to call if I ever needed to talk,'' Miss Gillming said. ``He
also gave me the name and telephone number of his personal doctor in
Lincoln.''
   Miss Gillming said Kerrey told her an artificial leg eventually
will allow her to function normally.
   ``That gave me a real good outlook for the future,'' she said.

   Gov. Richard Celeste went to a news conference
in a different capacity: he worked as a television reporter for a
day.
   Celeste attended a news conference Monday about parking
violators, then hit the pavement to tape some footage on the
sidewalk.
   ``I was impressed,'' said cameraman Herb Thomas, who kept the
governor in focus for more than an hour. ``His stand-up could rival
most of our reporters. It was a pretty long stand-up, 10 or 12
seconds, and he remembered most of it the first time.''
   The stint was part of Celeste's Work Day program through which he
seeks to get a better understanding of the state's work force. How
did he like it?
   ``It takes more concentration when you are on this side of the
microphone,'' said Celeste. ``I've never been a believer you can be
completely objective.''

   The public has glimpsed the nightmarish world of
domestic violence through Hedda Nussbaum's testimony in the Lisa
Steinberg case. But experts say more than increased awareness is
needed to save the lives of children like 6-year-old Lisa and, now,
5-year-old Jessica Cortez.
   ``We were seeing five deaths a day (nationally) before Lisa died,
and five deaths per day since then,'' said Dr. Richard Krugman of
the Kempe National Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse and
Neglect in Denver.
   ``I can't blame the public. I don't think the public knows what
to do,'' said Krugman.
   Lisa Steinberg made headlines when she died in November 1987 _ a
symbol of a system gone wrong. She made front-page news again last
week, at the trial of Joel Steinberg _ the man she knew as Daddy,
the man accused of murdering her.
   But last Wednesday _ when the brutal beating death in Brooklyn of
5-year-old Jessica Cortez grabbed the headlines away _ it was the
same old story; only the name had changed.
   Jessica Cortez's mother, Abigail, and the mother's boyfriend,
Adrian Lopez, were unemployed. They lived in a city-owned housing
project in Brooklyn. On the surface, they had nothing in common with
the Steinberg family _ except that children in their home also were
battered.
   One day after police found Lopez standing over Jessica's limp
body, they returned to the apartment and found Jessica's 9-year-old
half-brother, Nicky Lebron Alvarez, quivering in a closet, badly
beaten with 10 bones broken.
   Family Court authorities charged Monday that welfare officials
knew that Ms. Cortez had a history of child neglect but failed to
tell a judge about it, according to a published report. The New York
Times said in Tuesday's editions that during a 1986 custody hearing,
welfare officials called the woman a good mother even though the
city's Special Services for Children department had filed a neglect
petition against her three years earlier.
   ``Ninety-five percent of the American public knows child abuse
exists _ that's not the issue anymore,'' said Krugman. ``My
impression is people make some cosmetic changes (after rekindled
awareness of child abuse); it's like firing a football coach when
you've got bigger problem than just the coach.''
   ``Now, we need a new kind of public awareness _ that physical
abuse of children, the Lisa Steinberg type cases, are preventable if
people want to do something.''
   The National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse
estimated there were 1,132 child-abuse fatalities in the United
States last year; Krugman puts the figure at 2,000 to 5,000.
   There were 2.25 million official reports of abused children
nationally in 1987, including 25 percent who were physically abused
and 14 percent who were sexually abused, the committee's report
said. Jessica Cortez fit into both those categories, police said.
   She also fit into a third category: at least 103 children died of
abuse last year in New York City.
   Authorities say those numbers aren't likely to decline despite
widespread publicity about child abuse and the Steinberg case _ live
national television coverage on Cable News Network, a cover story in
Newsweek, hours of local TV coverage of Ms. Nussbaum's testimony.
   But it will have some positive effect, they believe.
   ``The Steinberg case puts the spotlight on the topic,'' said
Detective Joseph Ryan, coordinator of domestic violence programs for
the New York City police. ``This case is very important because it
is that much more detailed, and serves to show the dynamics of
violence in a family situation.''
   Agreed Carol Digirolamo, executive director of the Governor's
Commission on Domestic Violence: ``There clearly is some increase in
awareness.''
   The deaths of Steinberg and Jessica also illustrated one of the
more frightening aspects of child abuse: it crosses all lines of
race, economics and geography. And domestic violence is rarely
limited to just one family member, experts in the field say.
   Steinberg was a lawyer. Ms. Nussbaum, his live-in lover, was a
children's book editor. They lived a comfortable existence in a
historic building in Manhattan's upscale Greenwich Village. And,
authorities said, their two illegally adopted children were
ill-treated.
   When Lisa was found in a coma Nov. 2, 1987, the other child,
Mitchell, was sitting in a dirty diaper, tethered to a chair and
drinking spoiled milk. Ms. Nussbaum also had been badly battered.
   In both the Steinberg and Cortez cases, drugs were apparently
involved _ another disturbing trend which has contributed to the
rising number of child abuse cases.
   Ms. Nussbaum has detailed how she and Steinberg freebased cocaine
while Lisa lay unconscious in another room. Neighbors of Lopez and
Ms. Cortez said they were also drug users, smoking marijuana and
crack.
   From July 1, 1987, to June 30, 1988, the city Human Resources
Administration estimated 14 percent of its 55,286 reported abuse
cases were tied to drugs _ a 67 percent jump from the previous 12
months.

   In the days before newspapers had the ability
to print photographs, special artists were dispatched to great
national events _ including presidential inaugurals _ to record the
event on sketch pads.
   That era is recalled, in these days before the inauguration of
George Bush as the nation's 41st president, in a small Capitol
exhibit.
   It displays the views that artists for ``Harper's Weekly,''
``Frank Leslie's Illustrated News'' and other publications provided
of the inauguration of every president from 1853 to 1905.
   Entitled ``Hail To The Chief,'' the exhibit also recalls the
circumstances that gave each of those ceremonies its own flavor.
   An 1853 sketch shows President-elect Franklin Pierce and outgoing
President Millard Fillmore striding through the Capitol Rotunda on
the way to the inaugural platform on the East Front, the traditional
site of inaugurals until President Reagan took the oath of office on
the West Front in 1981.
   Pierce's vice president, William King, was sworn in by the U.S.
counsel in Havana, the only president or vice president-elect ever
to take the oath of office outside the United States.
   Convalescing from a serious illness, King died six weeks later.
   Pierce objected on religious grounds from swearing his oath. He
exercised an option permitted him by the Constitution and affirmed
it instead. He is the only president to have done that.
   The drawing of James Buchanan's inauguration in 1857 shows the
scaffolding and hoists being used to build the new Senate wing of
the Capitol.
   By the time Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated four years later the
new high dome of the Capitol is shown half completed. By the time of
Lincoln's second inauguration in 1865 the dome is complete, crowned
with the statue of Armed Freedom on top.
   An 1861 illustration shows Lincoln and Buchanan en route to the
Capitol in an open carriage, passing a shop sign reading ``Great
Book Sale.''
   The exhibit's text recalls that when Lincoln reached the
inaugural stand, he could not find a place to put his ``hallmark
stove pipe hat.''
   Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's unsuccessful rival for the presidency,
reached out his hand for it.
   ``If I cannot be president, at least I can hold his hat,'' he
said.
   In 1869 the nation's preeminent war hero, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant,
was sworn in as president and his predecessor, Andrew Johnson, broke
a precedent,
   Insulted by Grant's refusal to accompany him on the traditional
ride down Pennsylvania Avenue, Johnson refused to take part in the
inaugural ceremonies.
   The general served two scandal-plagued terms and the 1877
inaugural drawing shows him looking on as Rutherford B. Hayes takes
the oath.
   Hayes, a Republican, had lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel
J. Tilden but some Electoral College votes were in dispute.
   The issue was settled by a special commission and the nod went to
Hayes.
   Since March 4, the date of presidential inaugurations in that
era, fell on a Sunday that year, the ceremonies were postponed until
Monday, March 5.
   But to ensure that the nation not be without a president, Hayes
took the oath secretly on March 3 in the Red Room of the White House.
   James A. Garfield was inaugurated in 1881 and for the first time
women were front and center on the inaugural platform, moving from
the seats in the rear traditionally reserved for them. His wife,
mother and the wife of President Hayes all sat in the front row.
   When Garfield completed the presidential oath, he turned and
kissed his mother, the first mother ever to see her son inaugurated
as president.
   Beginning the first of two non-consecutive terms in 1885, Grover
Cleveland took the oath on a family Bible inscribed to S.G.
Cleveland. It had been given to him by his mother before he dropped
his given name, Stephen.
   The illustration for the Benjamin Harrison inauguration in 1889
shows Harrison taking the oath surrounded by a sea of umbrellas.
Officials had wanted to move the ceremonies in out of the rain but
the president-elect overruled them.
   The year 1889 was also the centennial of the inauguration of the
first president, George Washington. Harrison made the most of the
celebration, playing the role of Washington at several events in New
York City.
   If he cares to, George Bush can follow suit in 1989, the
bicentennial of Washington's inauguration.
   The artist who depicted William McKinley's inauguration in 1897
shows spectators viewing the scene from the roof of the newly
completed Library of Congress.
   In 1905, Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders gathered to ride in
Roosevelt's inaugural parade.
   But they ran into a problem: There weren't enough cavalry horses
for them to ride. So they used horses borrowed from the horse
artillery which were accustomed to hauling cannons, not passengers.
   The horses didn't follow orders and, the exhibit text notes,
``The Rough Riders literally lived up to their name.''
   At the ceremonies, Roosevelt wore a ring containing a lock of
Abraham Lincoln's hair loaned to him for the occasion by Secretary
of State John Hay who had served as Lincoln's White House secretary.
   By that time the era of the ``special artist'' was nearly over.
   The era of the press photographer was about to begin.

<HEAD>Switched Vote Only Surprise in Electoral College Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West Virginia elector who says the nation has
``outgrown'' the Electoral College provided the only surprise during
the constitutional ritual officially electing George Bush as the
nation's 41st president.
   Margarette Leach switched her Democratic ballot _ voting for
Lloyd Bentsen for president and Michael Dukakis for vice president _
as she and 537 other electors carried out their constitutional duty.
   Otherwise, all voted as pledged to give Bush and Republican
running mate Dan Quayle each 426 electoral votes, far more than the
270 needed for election over Dukakis and Bentsen. The switched
ballot gave Dukakis one vote fewer than the 112 presidential
electors he earned in winning 10 states and the District of Columbia.
   ``I did it for a reason, and the reason was to make a statement
about the Electoral College,'' said Leach, a Huntington, W.Va.,
nurse. ``It was fine then (when it began), but we've outgrown it.''
   For example, Leach said, she and the 269 other female electors
``could have put a woman in'' as president if they hadn't wanted to
vote for the nominated candidates.
   ``I wish I had voted for Kitty Dukakis now,'' she said.
   The Electoral College vote set the stage for another
suspense-free ceremony on Jan. 4, when a joint session of Congress
meets and Bush, as vice president, is to open the sealed ballots and
formally declare himself the president-elect.
   Although other electors voted as expected, many agreed with Leach
about the antiquated but constitutionally required Electoral College
system devised by the Founding Fathers two centuries ago.
   Nevada elector Eileen Schouweiller called it ``silly'' and
``archaic.''
   ``However,'' she added, ``I suspect it will be with us for a long
time to come.''
   After casting their votes for Dukakis and Bentsen, Wisconsin's 11
electors voted 9-2 to pass along some unsolicited advice to Congress
in the form of a resolution urging the Electoral College be scrapped.
   ``The system is fatally flawed,'' said elector Lawrence Longley.
``We should not be in a position to decide upon who should be
president. It should be decided most appropriately by the American
people.''
   Although the Constitution does not require electors to vote as
their state's voters directed, there have been few deviations over
two centuries of elections. Before Leach's change, there had been
only eight ``faithless electors.''
   Democratic electors in New York and Minnesota, and a Republican
in Texas, didn't carry through with suggestions that they might cast
symbolic votes for another candidate for president or vice president.
   ``I have reservations about Mr. Quayle,'' said Texas elector
William F. Spivey Jr. ``But our president (Bush), who I do not have
reservations about, has seen fit to choose him, so I'm going to go
with what he says. ... I should have abstained, probably.''
   Some states carried out brief ceremonies steeped in history,
while others made a party of the event. Still others got the
formalities of voting and paper-signing over within 10 minutes.
   Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, telephoned electors pledged
to him in Iowa and addressed a ceremonial gathering of his electors
in the Statehouse in Boston.
   ``I'm sorry I'm not here in another capacity,'' Dukakis said.
``But I want you to know there's nothing that compares to running
for the presidency of the United States.
   ``I wish the president-elect well,'' he added. ``But I also know
there were some things we were fighting about in the campaign that
are going to be there on January 20th, and they're important.''
   Bush and Quayle will be sworn into office Jan. 20.
   Many electors said they had received mail from people urging them
to deny Quayle his election as vice president. Some said they
weren't enthusiastic about Quayle, but they weren't buying the idea
of dumping him.
   ``I love George Bush and I'm very enthusiastic about that, but
I'm not real happy with the selection of Quayle,'' said elector
Tommy Thomas, a former Florida state Republican chairman who voted
for Quayle anyway.
   ``I think the process should be changed and I hope it will be
changed,'' he said.
   Among the other electors who voted for Bush and Quayle were
Bush's brother Prescott S. Bush Jr., in Connecticut; Bush's son Neil
Bush, in Colorado; his designated White House chief of staff, Gov.
John Sununu of New Hampshire; and Penn State football coach Joe
Paterno, a Bush campaign supporter.

   NASA is laying the groundwork to send the next
generation of astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit early in the 21st
century, with missions to Mars and a space station on a Martian moon
among the possibilities.
   In a report released Monday, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said the nation must make a ``modest investment of
resources'' during the 1990s to prepare the nation for a range of
opportunities in space.
   ``This ability is critical to United States leadership in
space,'' said the report titled, ``Beyond Earth's Boundaries: Human
Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.''
   The report examined several strategies for exploring the inner
reaches of the solar system, including establishing a manned lunar
observatory, setting up a space station on the Martian moon Phobos
or sending astronauts to the red planet itself early in the next
century.
   The ambitious blueprint addresses President Reagan's directive on
space policy issued last January. The directive sets as a long-range
goal ``to expand human presence and activity beyond Earth orbit into
the solar system.''
   Frank Martin, assistant administrator of NASA's Office of
Exploration, said ``there's every indication'' the Bush
administration will support that policy.
   The underpinnings of any strategy to send space explorers to the
moon and beyond in the next two decades will be increased NASA
funding for development of new technology, life sciences research,
unmanned robotic missions, development of a new fleet of launch
vehicles able to lift heavier loads, and continued commitment to
Space Station Freedom, which is planned for Earth orbit in the
mid-1990s.
   If those conditions are met, the United States could send
astronauts to Phobos in 2003 or to Mars in 2007 or establish by 2005
a lunar base from which astronauts could build a Mars outpost in
2015, said John Aaron, who headed the Office of Exploration during
production of the report.
   Aaron said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates
for the missions studied in the report. ``We are not talking about
missions that are cheap,'' he said, but ``we think these are
affordable.''
   Martin said such missions probably could be accomplished at less
real cost than the Apollo program, which put U.S. astronauts on the
moon in 1969. At its height, the Apollo program cost about 4 percent
of the federal budget annually, which in today's dollars would be
about $25 billion, he said.
   ``You can't do the civil space program on the cheap,'' he said,
noting the nation now spends about $11 billion annually on NASA
programs. The fiscal 1989 federal budget is about $1.1 trillion.
   ``We're not a poor nation. We can figure out how to do these
things if they're important to us,'' he said, adding that
international cooperation could help support these missions.
   Martin said NASA must leap many technological hurdles before it
can accomplish the goal of establishing a permanent human presence
in space, but ``I don't see any show stoppers there.''
   NASA's Project Pathfinder, under whose umbrella much of the
research will be done, gets $40 million this year and the same
amount next year, despite NASA's request for $100 million. Martin
said annual funding for the program must increase to $100 million
soon.
   The report focused on four case studies for sending astronauts to
the moon, Phobos and Mars. One scenario would send astronauts to
Phobos and then on to Mars; another would launch astronauts directly
to Mars; a third would establish a manned observatory on the far
side of the moon; and a fourth would use an outpost on the moon as a
stepping stone to Mars.
   Aaron, who is now special assistant to the director at Johnson
Space Center, emphasized that the four case studies are not proposed
missions, but rather vehicles for assessing exploration techniques
and validating assumptions.
   A key finding, Aaron said, is that a mission to Phobos could
significantly offset the scale and uncertainties of a direct mission
to Mars.
   An Earth-to-Mars mission would require many new technologies,
including advanced propulsion and braking systems, and would require
advanced operations such as in-orbit assembly, long-term storage and
in-orbit transfer of propellant. Much work in the life sciences also
would be needed, and because the mission would last more than 14
months artificial gravity might be needed to maintain the health of
the crew, the report said.
   Phobos is believed to be an asteroid ``captured'' by Mars'
gravity and is thought to contain a substantial amount of water and
carbon-based materials, which could offer potential sources of
rocket fuel that could be tapped for exploratory missions to Mars.
   ``Phobos is an attractive way to go to Mars,'' Martin said. ``I
would be surprised if Phobos isn't a part of the U.S. going to
Mars.''

   Bank robbers killed one policeman and
seriously wounded another in the central England city of Coventry
Monday before holing up in a suburban house where one robber shot
himself to death, police said.
   One of the alleged robbers gave himself up but the other ignored
police attempts to negotiate and then shot himself in the head in a
back room of the house, said West Midlands Assistant Chief Constable
Mervyn Jones.
   Police Superintendent Martin Burton said the officer who died was
an unarmed patrolman in his mid-30s. He was thought to have died
instantly after being shot at point-blank range with a
double-barreled shotgun.
   Police said he had stopped the raiders' getaway car soon after
the robbery at the Midland Bank in which $1,100 was stolen.
   The robbers then switched cars and drove onto a highway where
they were rammed by an unmarked police car. Police said a patrolman
in that vehicle was shot in the stomach.
   The gunmen then ran across a golf course before forcing their way
into the home of a plumbing contractor and his family. It was not
known whether they took any hostages.
   Police said the wounded officer, also in his 30s, was recovering
in hospital. A third officer was being treated in hospital for shock.

shining in this South America city of 10 million is cast by the moon.
   Spotlights on public monuments, the flashing neon glare of
billboards, lights in office towers, store windows and even on a
Christmas tree near a main thoroughfare have been turned down or
even off by government order.
   There is an electricity shortage.
   Streetlights have been dimmed by 50 percent. Drivers, who usually
careen along narrow, often cobblestone streets downtown with only
their cars' parking lights have taken to turning on low beams.
   The problem stems from seasonally low levels of water in the
Uruguay, Limay and Neuquen rivers that feed hydroelectric stations
and the shutdown for repairs or maintenance of Argentina's two
nuclear power plants.
   The system ``is working at the limit of its capacity, and we
should be prepared for whatever eventuality and are running the risk
of a total outage,'' said Daniel Larriqueta, a spokesman for the
Interior Ministry.
   Portenos, as residents of this port city are called, have had to
make do with rotating, scheduled outages of five hours a day since
last week.
   City residents have become accustomed to summertime electricity
shortages as the city has grown faster than its public services can
handle. Blackouts, which have occurred half a dozen times since
1965, are relatively rare, however. The last occurred in November
1985.
   The latest scheduled outages have meant walking up flights of
stairs for lack of working elevators, sweating in late spring heat
for lack of air conditioning, and dodging four, five and sometimes
six lanes of cars at rush hour for lack of functioning traffic
signals.
   Beginning today, the hours of the three government-controlled
television stations in this capital city will be cut back to 12
hours _ noon to midnight. The two private stations have been
requested by the government to do likewise.
   The usual hours of operation are 7 a.m. to 3 a.m.
   Nighttime events like horseracing at the Hipodromo and concerts
have been canceled until further notice unless the facility has its
own source of electricity. Soccer games, usually played at night to
avoid daytime heat, have been rescheduled for the afternoon.
   At the huge Salto Grande hydroelectric complex on the Uruguay
River north of the capital, only one of 14 turbines was operating
Tuesday. The rest were idled by lack of water.
   The Atucha nuclear power plant, about 60 miles north of Buenos
Aires, has been shut down since August for repairs to its cooling
system. The Embalse station, 465 miles to the west of the capital,
is undergoing routine maintenance.
   About three weeks ago, the government for the first time in years
ordered clocks to be set back one hour to take advantage of the
extra daylight.
   The time change will stay in effect at least until Jan. 15, when
one of the nuclear plants should be back on line, said Eduardo
Cohen, director of planning at the the Ministry of Public Works'
energy secretariat. Water levels probably won't rise until seasonal
rains return in May, he said.
   On the lighter side, energy restrictions will be lifted the
following two weekends for Christmas and New Year's, a government
spokesman said.

   Former Rep. James Stanton of Ohio is entering
the race for chairman of the national Democratic Party with support
from Ohio's two U.S. senators but without the backing of his state's
top two Democratic Party officials.
   Stanton scheduled a news conference today to make his bid
official.
   He has won the support of Sens. John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum,
but Ohio Democratic Chairman James Ruvulo and Vice Chair Thea Boyd
on Monday lined up behind another candidate, Michigan Democratic
Chairman Richard Wiener.
   Wiener was among the first to announce his candidacy for the job
being vacated by Paul Kirk.
   Wiener on Monday announced the support of 13 other state party
leaders from the Midwest. They include the state party chairs from
North Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Nebraska and Indiana as well as vice chairs from several states.
   Stanton said he's confident Democratic National Committee members
who examine his background will be convinced he's right for the job.
   ``I've built a ward organization; I've run a city council; I've
run an $800 million business,'' Stanton said Monday. ``I have the
communications skills to talk to the people who are going to
financially energize any political party in this country.''
   ``I believe I have a very viable chance to win,'' Stanton said.
   Stanton's decision followed a lengthy testing-the-waters period.
   ``I've been very much encouraged by people I respect deeply,
people like (former DNC Chairman) Bob Strauss and others,'' Stanton
said, adding that he's also lined up the backing of several members
of Congress from Ohio as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984
campaign manager, Gerald Austin, and Jackson's 1988 campaign
manager, Arnold Pinkney.
   That's significant because one of the contenders for the post is
Ronald H. Brown, a longtime party activist most recently associated
with Jackson.
   Stanton is a former congressman and Cleveland City Council
president who dropped out of public life after a 1976 Democratic
Primary loss to Metzenbaum.
   Metzenbaum, Glenn, Ohio Reps. Mary Rose Oakar and Louis Stoes and
former House Speaker Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts last week signed a
mailgram urging union leaders to back Stanton.
   The party's new leader is to be chosen at a meeting in Washington
Feb. 9 and 10.

<TEXT>
   The New York City Opera gave departing general
director Beverly Sills a farewell party Monday night, and the grand
ballroom of the Plaza Hotel resounded with celebrity toasts.
   ``She is so warm, effervescent and fun, you immediately forget
her incredible voice. When you do, she gets really annoyed,'' teased
actress Mary Tyler Moore.
   Miss Moore concluded, ``You have garnered as much love as you
have praise for your work as an artist and business woman, and I
toast you.''
   Sills noted that she has had a ``meaningful relationship'' with
the opera company for 33 years and two months. She was its
coloratura superstar and for the past 10 years its general director.
Following her resignation the opera announced she would be succeeded
in March by Christopher Keene.
   ``I have reached the age of 59, and 50 years of my life have been
spent in opera,'' she said. ``Interesting things are being offered
to me. I feel a third career is somewhere out there right around the
corner.''
   Mike Wallace of the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' suggested in
his toast that Sills become mayor of New York, or as he put it,
``her honor, the prima donna.''
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, who spoke at a reception before
the dinner, suggested that Sills become a TV interviewer.
   The master of ceremonies, TV interviewer Barbara Walters, sang
original lyrics spelling ``Beverly,'' beginning with ``B is for the
beauty of your soul, dear.'' Then she invited the audience to sing a
second time through.
   Songwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green sang, very fast, words
they'd written to the finale of Tchaikovsky's ``Fourth Symphony,''
ending with Miss Sills' nickname, ``Bubbles, Bubbles, Bubbles.''
   Actress Helen Hayes praised Miss Sills' acting in opera and said,
``Let me make you our national city treasure.''
   Actress Barbara Feldon said about the honoree, ``There is this
possibility for human radiance that can transcend all kinds of
troubles and make life really worthwhile.''
   Actor Len Cariou called Miss Sills ``an artist of life.''

<HEAD>Energy Department Expects Agreement on Ohio Plant Cleanup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A consent decree may be reached by the end of
the week for the cleanup of a federally owned uranium enrichment
plant in Ohio, a U.S. Energy Department official says.
   An agreement to clean up the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant
near Piketon in southern Ohio was announced last month by Ohio Gov.
Richard Celeste and state Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.
   However, the plan still was under review by the Energy Department
on Monday, spokesman Douglas G. Elmets said.
   A senior department official, who asked that he not be
identified, said the Energy Department ``may have a decision by the
end of the week on a consent decree'' that would involve court
supervision of a cleanup.
   When Celeste and Celebrezze announced the $50 million cleanup
plan last month, they said it was significant because the federal
agency would be bound by state law and regulation.
   The Piketon plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial
nuclear power reactors. It generates toxic wastes such as
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, solvents and metals, as well as
radioactive materials.
   When the agreement was announced Nov. 22, Celeste said he hoped
it would serve as a model for other tough cleanup cases, such as the
government-owned Fernald plant near Cincinnati. Environmental
officials say that plant has dumped radioactive waste improperly,
possibly contaminating ground water, since it began processing
uranium for nuclear weapons in 1951.
   The Piketon plan calls for the Energy Department to be subject to
orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, which
would supervise the cleanup of about 6 million pounds of waste. Last
month, officials said the agreement still needed to be incorporated
into a federal court consent decree.

<HEAD>Regulators Propose Reinsurance Agency To Oversee Thrift Clean Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are proposing the creation
of a new agency, possibly drawing money from banks, credit unions
and savings institutions, to oversee the clean up of the
money-losing savings and loan industry.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's
3,000 S&Ls, on Monday sent the broad outlines of the proposal to the
Treasury Department, which is formulating the incoming Bush
administration's plans for dealing with hundreds of insolvent
savings institutions, agency spokesman Karl Hoyle said.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, in a speech to a group called
the National Housing Conference, proposed what he called a
``reinsurance agency'' for all federally insured financial
institutions.
   On an unrelated topic, Wall also said the bank board is offering
to make foreclosed properties from failed savings institutions
available to house the homeless in a half dozen cities.
   The bank board's insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., has been paying for a record number of S&L rescues
this year primarily through promissory notes pledging future income
from an assessment on still-operating institutions.
   Wall has argued previously that the fees paid by S&Ls to the
FSLIC, as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurance
funds, were meant to cover a ``normal'' level of failures, not the
``catastrophic'' level of the current thrift crisis.
   Through Monday, regulators said they have resolved the cases of
159 insolvent thrifts this year. More than 400 insolvent S&Ls remain
open and hundreds of others are close to insolvency.
   The reinsurance agency would oversee three insurance funds _ for
banks, S&Ls and credit unions. It could collect premiums from all
three, spending them when one of the funds got in trouble. It also
could serve as the mechanism for further borrowing to pay for the
thrift crisis or as the conduit for any money Congress wanted to
spend on the cleanup.
   Bank board member Lawrence White, in an interview, said the
proposal leaves open who will pay for the S&L cleanup and whether a
new agency's expenditures would be counted toward the budget deficit.
   ``I don't think it is intended to be a back door way of getting
them (banks and credit unions) to pay for the FSLIC's current
problems,'' White said. ``The concept is both a funding mechanism
and a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs'' in
the future.
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in weekend editions that
the Reagan administration, in its 1990 budget, will acknowledge for
the first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the thrift
industry problem.
   An administration source, who declined to be named, told The
Associated Press that the Treasury Department estimates the cost of
restoring the thrift industry to health at $60 billion to $75
billion if interest rates remain unchanged and as high as $105
billion if interest rates increase by two percentage points. The
figures were first reported by The Washington Post.
   Regarding the proposal to use S&L properties for the homeless,
Hoyle said the bank board is talking with six or seven cities in
Texas and in the North and Midwest. He declined to identify them.
   Hoyle said the bank board would lend the properties _ in some
cases commercial buildings near soup kitchens _ to municipal
governments, which in turn would pay to administer them as temporary
shelters.
   ``That ball is in their court at this juncture. They have to
decide if they have the funds,'' he said. ``We would like to get it
done in the winter when this housing would be most useful to the
homeless.''
   Discussions with the cities started several months ago, Hoyle
said. Another effort, to persuade private groups to purchase
foreclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poor
families, began about a year ago, he said.
   Wall disclosed the homeless initiative on the same day that
President-elect Bush, in announcing the appointment of Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said
his administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem of
homelessness.

<HEAD>FAA Proposes Change in Airport `High Density' Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large airlines at four major airports would
have to prove they make heavy use of their takeoff and landing slots
or risk losing them to other carriers, under a proposed federal rule
change.
   The proposal, released Monday by the Federal Aviation
Administration, would revise the ``high density'' rule at Chicago
O'Hare International, LaGuardia and Kennedy International in New
York and Washington National.
   The rule, adopted in 1969, limits the number of takeoff and
landing slots at the airports during heavy traffic periods.
Currently, airlines must show that they are using those slots during
65 percent of the heavy traffic hours over a two-month period.
   The new proposal would require large air carriers with 10 or more
slots to show that the slots are being used at a 90 percent rate or
the FAA would consider withdrawing them. The requirement would be 80
percent for carriers with five to nine slots and would stay at 65
percent for all others.
   The slots that are taken away from an airline could then be
available for sale or reallocation to a different airline, the FAA
said.
   The change would ``increase opportunity for new entrant carriers
to have access to high-density airports, and for small incumbent
carriers to increase the number of operations at those airports,''
the FAA said in a statement.
   American Airlines spokesman Al Becker said his company was
``encouraged'' that the FAA wanted to make sure the takeoff and
landing slots are fully utilized.
   ``We're using every single slot we have,'' Becker said. ``At some
airports we obviously could use more.'' He said that in some cases,
airlines have held their slots without fully using them.
   The limits on takeoff and landing slots are necessary because an
airport's air traffic control system has limited capacity, Becker
said.
   ``We are not in favor of any slot program at all if it can be
avoided,'' Becker said, but eliminating the system would require
costly expansion of the air traffic control systems.
   The FAA is seeking public and aircraft industry comments on its
proposal.

<HEAD>Government Fining Companies That Missed Emissions Reporting
Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is levying almost $1.5 million
in fines against 25 companies for failing to meet a new deadline for
reporting chemical emissions.
   Almost half the penalties would be accounted for by one plant,
Inland Steel Co.'s works at East Chicago, Ind., which was accused by
the Environmental Protection Agency of not reporting emissions of 33
different substances ranging from aluminum to xylene.
   Inland's proposed fine was set at $721,000. Spokesman Bob Lefley
said Monday, ``We reported, except we reported late,'' after the
July 1 deadline.
   ``Since this is the country's second-largest steel plant, it was
a monumental task.'' Lefley declined further comment.
   The law requiring reports of emissions was passed in 1986 in
response to the Bhopal disaster in India two years earlier in which
more than 2,000 people were killed by escaping methyl isocyanate, a
gas used in making pesticides.
   Companies in a broad swath of industrial categories are required,
among other things, to report releases to air, water and land of 320
hazardous or toxic chemicals or chemical families. EPA forms were
supposed to have been filled out and filed with both EPA and state
authorities.
   All 25 plants proposed for fines were checked by inspectors from
EPA's regional offices, and penalties were chosen to reflect the
size of the company, the number of chemicals that should have been
reported, the quantities released and the amount being used, EPA
said.
   ``We're not talking about a major enforcement action here,'' said
Bill Walsh of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy
organization that has kept track of developments in the field.
``There are 15,000 to 16,000 companies that EPA knows of that have
not filled out the forms out of 30,000'' that were obliged to.
   EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said she could not confirm Walsh's
figures. However, she said investigators were finding that of
companies they looked at, roughly one-third had not complied fully
with the reporting requirements.
   EPA could have imposed fines of $25,000 per day. The companies
have 20 days to notify EPA whether they want to pay the fine, to try
to negotiate a lower fine or to contest the fine before an
administrative law judge.
   Here are the companies and locations of the affected plants,
along with the plant's principal product or line of business, the
chemicals whose emissions should have been reported and the fines.
The agency did not say how much of each chemical was involved.

   Morris Siegel is homeless, wealthy and
unwilling to change even though his health may someday force him to
use the $190,000 estate he inherited from his parents in 1979.
   The 71-year-old recently agreed to claim the inheritance, which
has grown to $207,421, but said he has no intention of changing his
lifestyle.
   For the last 20 years, Siegel has lived in alleys or boarding
rooms. He likes his lifestyle and has no use for money, the former
cab driver said during a street corner interview last week.
   ``I don't want it. When you're young, the money means
something,'' he said, refusing a lengthy interview or photographs.
If he did have money, he said, he would just lose it to thieves.
   Siegel said he has known about the money since his father died in
1979. He claimed it only because of pressure from relatives, he said.
   Siegel's father, a blacksmith named Sam, left the estate to his
son, said Kenneth Landon of the state Controller's Office in Los
Angeles.
   When the inheritance went unclaimed, the account was turned over
to the county Public Administrator's Office, then to the state, said
Daniel Zingale, a special assistant to the state controller in the
Division of Unclaimed Property.
   Zingale said Siegel's cousin, Mildred Weitzman, contacted him in
September 1987 asking for help in her efforts to get Siegel to claim
the money.
   Siegel was uninterested, but more than a year later, he did sign
documents, Zingale said. Landon said the money will probably be
deposited in to an account in Siegel's name.
   Last week, doctors at UCLA Medical Center told Siegel he had a
heart condition and other medical problems, said Mayor Lachman,
another of Siegel's cousins.
   ``Living on the streets, he could be harassed and pressured for
money and he was scared,'' Lachman said. ``He was never really
interested in the money because he wants to live a different kind of
lifestyle.
   ``Living on the street _ that's his greatest desire. I want him
to live a little better, a little easier,'' he said.

   Pat Paquin says she's been amazed by an
outpouring of support since her husband was nearly electrocuted
trying to help an accident victim. A neighbor plows her driveway and
a merchant dropped off a Christmas tree.
   ``Somebody else brought us our wood, and people have been
stacking our wood,'' she said. ``Every couple of days I'll come home
from the hospital and dinner will be on the doorstep.''
   On Nov. 25, Ed Paquin ran into downed electrical wires while
rushing to aid the driver of a truck that struck a utility pole in
Shaftsbury, in southwest Vermont. As his family watched from their
vehicle, 7,200 volts of electricity pulsed through Paquin's body.
   His sister, Alice, revived him and rescue crews delivered him to
the Albany, N.Y., Medical Center partially paralyzed, with serious
internal injuries and burns on his neck and knees.
   Today, Paquin, 35, is in fair condition and recovering slowly at
the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont in Burlington. He receives
burn treatment and therapy, and his 7-year-old daughter Catherine
reads to him. The other day he reached a milestone _ he moved his
legs.
   ``I'm glad to be alive, but it's really hard not to know how much
and how long it's going to take to recover,'' he said last week.
   ``I'm really lucky that people in my town and other people
around, they just have been really good and supportive and
everything,'' he said, tears in his eyes, when asked what keeps him
going.
   ``It gives you some faith when you feel people have faith in you.
And that's the way people have been making me feel.''
   Paquin is a self-employed carpenter and member of the Rescue
Squad in his hometown of Fairfax, a small town 15 miles northeast of
Burlington. One of his friends, Dan Stoddard of nearby Huntington,
described him as full of fun and life.
   ``He's a musician. He's always the life of the party _ he'd bring
his banjo or guitar. The unfortunate part of the accident, he can't
move his hands at all. But that may just be a matter of therapy,''
Stoddard said.
   Friends said it was just like him to rush to the aid of an
accident victim.
   ``That's why he was on the rescue squad in the first place,'' his
wife said. ``We saw the accident, and ... I was just thinking,
`We're supposed to be someplace,' and I remember him saying
something about he didn't see any rescue vehicles and he thought he
could do something. It's not something I could do.''
   Ironically, the driver of the truck apparently picked his way
through the live wires and left the scene moments before the Paquins
drove by, according to police and witnesses.
   Michael Hulbert of Bennington pleaded innocent Monday to charges
of leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended
license. A court clerk said he was released on his own recognizance
pending an appearance sometime next month.
   Pat Paquin, a part-time, free-lance journalist, said the most
difficult days were the ones right after the accident.
   ``It's so hard to explain to anyone who hasn't gone through it,
the constant fear you'll get a call from the hospital and something
will be wrong,'' she said.
   In the last week or so, after staying with relatives while her
husband was in Albany, she returned home and was greeted by the
generosity of neighbors and friends. One changed the tires on her
car. The Fairfax Rescue Squad has begun a fund-raising campaign to
help defray the couple's expenses.
   ``He has survived something no one thought he should have
survived. Everybody thinks it's a miracle,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A court has reversed the last of the
disciplinary suspensions against the presidents of federal employee
unions for actively supporting Democrat Walter Mondale in the 1984
presidential campaign.
   The ruling by the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New
York vacates charges brought in 1985 by the Merit Systems Protection
Board against Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National
Association of Letter Carriers, and Moe Biller, president of the
American Postal Workers Union.
   After a series of hearings, the board in 1987 ordered Sombrotto,
Biller and Kenneth Blaylock, former president of the American
Federation of Government Employees, suspended from their government
jobs for 60 days under the 1939 Hatch Act.
   The 1939 law forbids government workers from taking ``an active
part in political management or political campaigns.''

   A mail-order catalog firm that has
begun catering to the captive audience of prisoners reports
Christmas sales are on the rise.
   ``They are very good customers and it's developed into a
substantial segment of our business. Where else are they going to
go?'' said Mortimer Polep, chairman of the Holyoke-based Paysaver
Catalog Showrooms Inc.
   ``We even got a thank-you letter from one inmate who said, `After
all, our money is as good as the guy that hasn't been caught yet,'''
he said.
   Paul Hahn of the 2,000-member National Mail Order Association,
based in Los Angeles, said it's impossible to tell how many inmates
order from catalogs, but sales seem to be up everywhere.
   ``We don't keep any special statistics on sales to prison
inmates, but my sense is that they have been increasing as prisons
have eased the regulations on what kinds of packages prisoners can
receive,'' he said.
   Polep said his company's Christmas sales to prisoners are up 25
percent this year, but he won't divulge exactly how big his business
is behind bars.
   At the 1,100-inmate state prison at Norfolk, Sgt. Christopher
Cameron said he inspects about 30 packages a day that inmates have
ordered from catalogs. ``We don't allow them anything like hacksaws
or shotguns,'' he said.
   For the three weeks before Christmas, however, the prison
suspends its rules against mailed food and allows inmates to receive
packages up to 25 pounds holding mail-order and homemade delicacies.
   To inspect the food packages, the prison must hold up inspections
of other packages, which wait until after Christmas to reach inmates.
   ``The food is more important and meaningful to them anyway,''
Cameron said. ``They can get clothes all year.''
   The largest purveyors to the Norfolk prisoners are Cook Brothers,
an Illinois-based catalog firm specializing in low-cost items,
followed by Service Merchandise of Nashville, Tenn., and
merchandising giants J.C. Penney Co. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
Cameron said.
   Clothing is the big sales item at the medium-security prison,
followed by towels, television sets, radios and fans, he said.
   ``We've put together a little booklet on what they can order, but
essentially it's any basic necessity,'' Cameron said. ``They know by
word of mouth that if there were any problems with anyone trying to
bring in weapons or drugs, we would cut back on the orders and we
can trace it right back to who is responsible.''
   Payments are made by the prison against inmate accounts, he said.
They build up accounts by working in prison, or by getting money
from their families.
   Regulations on what prisoners can order vary widely from state to
state and prison to prison, according to state and federal
officials, with federal prisoners allowed only limited
catalog-ordering privileges.
   ``They have to have special prior permission, but half the time
the issue is not so much the regulations but the fact that our
inmates just don't have the money,'' said Kathryn Johnson, a
spokeswoman for the federal bureau of prisons.
   Sears treats its prison customers ``just like any others,'' said
spokeswoman Kathy Gucfa, except that it delivers packages directly
to the prisons rather than to its retail stores. ``Obviously they
can't get out to pick up their packages,'' she said.
   But Paysaver has employees assigned just to its prison business,
and Christmas is a particularly busy time.
   The woman in charge of the company's prison sales, who asked that
her name not be used, said some of her dealings with inmates ``have
helped restore my faith in human nature.
   ``Sometimes they don't figure the shipping charges right and if
it's just a couple of dollars, I send it out and just tuck a note
inside as to what is owed and almost always I get a check back,''
she said.
   ``I got a letter from a man at Attica (in New York) who said he
was sending Christmas presents to his kids in Florida and asked if I
could put a note inside the package saying, `With love, from
Daddy.'''

<HEAD>Jury Decides Against Shell In $2 Billion Arsenal Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BRUNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies claimed a major
victory after a jury decided Shell Oil Co. would have to spend up to
$2 billion to clean up three decades of pesticide pollution at the
Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado.
   ``The verdict was a clean, straight win for the insurers,'' said
Barry Bunshoft, an attorney for Lloyd's of London, the British
insurance market that had faced the biggest share of possible
liability. ``To say that this is an exciting win and a gratifying
win is an understatement.''
   The 250 insurance companies involved convinced a jury they should
not be held responsible for the contamination because Shell knew of
the pollution for 30 years. They claimed Shell was not covered by
its 800 different policies any more than a homeowner who set fire to
his own home.
   ``Naturally, we're extremely disappointed with the outcome of
this lengthy trial,'' said Betty Lynn McHam, a Shell spokeswoman in
Houston. ``We believe there are sound legal grounds for appealing to
a higher court and we will appeal.''
   In 1983, the Justice Department ordered the oil company to pay
the cleanup bill, then estimated at $1.8 billion. Shell subsequently
began trying to collect the money from its insurers.
   Dozens of insurance company attorneys whooped for joy Monday when
the verdict was read in San Mateo County Superior Court. The lengthy
trial was held in a makeshift courtroom at Crestmoor High School to
make room for all the lawyers.
   Eleven jurors voted for the insurance companies for the period
from 1952-59, with one juror against. For the period 1960-82, the
vote was 11 for the insurers and one undecided. A jury in a civil
suit does not have to reach a unanimous verdict.
   The jurors declined to comment on their decision.
   During those years, Shell leased the U.S. Army land at the
arsenal north of Denver's Stapleton International Airport for a
pesticide production plant. The soil and groundwater at the plant
was polluted by Shell and Army operations, and the pollution seeped
into nearby drinking water wells.
   Shell attorneys also argued before Judge William Lanam that the
liability should be mainly with the Army because it provided the
leaking pipes and ponds used by the oil company.
   ``Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, the citizens of
Colorado can be confident that Shell has and will continue to meet
its share of responsibilities at the Rocky Mountain arsenal. We are
hopeful that the remaining issues between the state of Colorado, the
U.S. Army and Shell can be resolved, thereby allowing the arsenal
cleanup to proceed expeditiously,'' Ms. McHam said.
   The trial, which began in October 1987, was held in San Mateo
County because of the county's record of completing cases promptly.
It included more than 4,000 exhibits and hundreds of hours of
testimony.
   Ms. McHam said she could not estimate the cost of the cleanup.
Insurance industry sources put it at $2 billion.

<HEAD>Styrofoam Snowmen, Curried Turkey: Christmas Is Different At The
Equator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   SINGAPORE _ The Santa Claus shortage has been averted and it
looks like Christmas as usual at the equator this year.
   In this steamy tropical land, Christmas is Styrofoam snowmen and
chestnuts roasted by street vendors in shorts. Department store
Santas are flown in from Finland, and the turkey is often curried.
   Most Singaporeans have never seen snow, let alone a reindeer. But
``I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'' and ``Rudolph the Red-nosed
Reindeer'' have been broadcast staples for weeks.
   Any danger that a shortage of Santas might dampen the holiday
spirit ended when more than 100 American tourists dressed as Santa
Claus started arriving in early December.
   Part of a ``Santa goodwill tour'' by the Telephone Pioneers of
America, a charitable organization, they play Santa for charity
while traveling each Christmas.
   Toys `R' Us and a few other stores won't have Santas because, in
the words of one merchant, ``it is hard to find a suitable
candidate.''
   But one department store, Robinson's, flew in a man from Finland
who store spokeswoman Lena Phua claims is ``the real Santa.'' While
his birth certificate identifies him as Saastamoinen Seppo, the
resident of Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland is the real thing, she
insisted.
   Illuminated trumpets, silver bells, angels, candles, fir trees,
snowflakes, reindeer, lanterns, yule logs, fairy lights and other
glitter adorn shopping centers and hotels.
   Street vendors in T-shirts and shorts sell roasted chestnuts. The
Centerpoint shopping center spent $207,254 on its fairytale
Christmas theme, decorating its building as a medieval castle.
   All this in a country 85 miles north of the equator where the
average daily temperature is 80 degrees.
   Only about 200,000 of the 2.6 million people in this island
republic profess to being Christians, according to the last census
in 1980. But apart from the country's independence day holiday in
August, no other period comes close to be being celebrated by the
entire population.
   The observance of Christmas, a British colonial import, appears
to have intensified in recent years among a population that is 76
percent Chinese, 15 percent Malay and 6 percent Indian.
   It blends Western trimmings with an Oriental flavor.
   Roast turkey with stuffing is available, but so are a variety of
other dishes based on the traditional bird, including curried turkey
and turkey noodles.
   The ``singing Christmas Tree,'' a multi-tiered stage in the shape
of a tree for a choir from the Trinity Christian Center, has been a
yuletide feature in recent years. In 1986, 27 men and women caroled
their way into the Guinness Book of World Records by singing for
more than 74 hours, ending at 1:05 a.m. Christmas morning.
   Reporter Thelma Sim lamented in The Sunday Times that local
carols in the Malay language, such as Ang Pasko ay Sumapit
(Christmas is Here Again) or Pasko sa aming Nayon (Christmas in My
Little Town), were neglected in favor of old favorites from the West.
   ``Deejays also play foreign carols on the air more than they do
the native ones ... Fake snow, fireplaces and Styrofoam snowmen are
often found in Christmas decorations in homes, department stores and
offices,'' she wrote.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.70 yen, up 0.68 yen from Monday's close
of 124.02 yen. After opening at 124.45 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 124.30 to 124.80 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 66.63
points on Monday, climbed 97.86 points, or 0.3 percent, finishing at
29,567.94. On Monday, the index closed at 29,470.08.
   Individual investors showed interest in steels, while
institutional investors remained on the sidelines amid speculation
over a possible U.S. discount rate hike, said Yoshio Shimoyama of
Nikko Securities.
   In foreign exchange trading, dealers attributed the dollar's
higher opening in Tokyo to the currency's early strength on the
Sydney market, which opened earlier. Market players in Australia
bought the currency in expectation of a discount rate increase in
the United States.
   The discount rate is the interest the Federal Reserve, the U.S.
central bank, charges on loans to commercial banks. Many market
watchers have been anticipating a discount rate hike in recent weeks
as part of the Fed's attempts to prevent resurgent inflation.
   Higher U.S. interest rates increase the returns on
dollar-denominated investments.

   The Soviet Union's leading educator says the
country's youth should no longer be taught by rote, that teachers
now recognize that individual thinking should be cultivated, not
plowed under.
   Gennady A. Yagodin, chairman of the State Education Committee,
says students will be allowed to choose elective courses and
teachers will be able to teach once-banned classics of 20th century
Russian literature under reforms being considered at a national
education conference this week.
   He did not specify which novels might be permitted to sway young
minds, but some of the masterworks rehabilitated in recent years
include Boris Pasternak's ``Doctor Zhivago'' and Mikhail Bulgakov's
``Master and Margarita.''
   Forcing every student to fit the same mold, which was long the
Soviet educational norm, fails to encourage greatness, Yagodin
acknowledged.
   ``The teacher hits the nail on the head'' to keep it from
sticking out, but this does great damage to the individual, he told
a news conference Monday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev repeatedly has said changes in
teaching methods and in the nation's curriculum are necessary to
guarantee that his drive for social and economic reform is a success.
   ``We pin hopes for the future largely on the work of our school _
which is only natural _ with its own teaching talents and the
creative pursuits of the Soviet teacher,'' Gorbachev told the
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in February at a
special meeting devoted to school reform.
   Yagodin raised the startling possibility that the new core
curriculum might not include mathematics _ considered abroad to be a
forte of Soviet education _ but that seemed to be his personal
desire rather than a pending policy.
   ``How many here can compute the square root of 174?'' he asked an
auditorium full of Soviet and foreign reporters, none of whom
answered. ``Does happiness depend on this?'' he asked.
   He suggested the core curriculum should include language study
and literature, science, and history.
   This week's conference in Moscow will choose the core curriculum
and the electives to be offered at higher two levels, Yagodin said.
   The first stage of schooling will last three or four years,
depending on the aptitude of the students, and they will have to
pass a test to move up because ``if a student poorly reads and
counts when he moves on, it builds in problems for the future,'' he
said.
   In the higher grades, students will spend less time on literary
criticism and more time reading actual literature, Yagodin said.
   ``We have students who can tell you Leo Tolstoy's mistakes, but
they have never read `War and Peace,''' he said.
   More literature from foreign countries and the non-Russian
nationalities of the Soviet Union will be added to the curriculum,
he said.
   More Soviet students will be going abroad in exchange programs as
well, he said. Already, the 2,500 young people attending classes
outside their homeland is three times the number in 1985, he said.

   Attorney Dean Sanders told client Jo
Ann Hawkins that he wanted a red Mercedes for Christmas, and she
made his wish come true. She even rode it into his fourth-floor law
office.
   Ms. Hawkins burst through the door of the Schenk and Sanders law
office in this north Texas city Monday atop a mule she'd named
Mercedes and decorated with a red ribbon.
   ``Those (other) Mercedes cost $70,000,'' the Bowie, Texas, woman
said. ``That's a $30 mule.''
   After riding in, Ms. Hawkins escorted the animal to a back room
where Sanders was meeting with a client, and knocked on the door.
   When handed the reins, Sanders responded, ``What is this?''
   Staff members who were in on the surprise broke into laughter as
the bewildered attorney came up with more questions.
   ``What is it? Is it a real mule? What's its name? Where am I
going to keep it?'' he asked.
   He said he isn't sure what he will do with the mule, which was
taken care of Monday night by a friend.
   ``I could take him over to the courthouse, stake him to the
courthouse lawn and he could run for judge next year,'' he said.

   In 1899, two local businessmen went to
Atlanta and acquired the first rights to bottle and distribute
Coca-Cola _ for $1.
   That's how the world's first Coke bottling plant wound up in this
southeastern Tennessee city, and that's why a retired Coca-Cola
executive wants to open a museum devoted to the popular soft drink.
   Sebert Brewer Jr. heads a group that's working on plans for The
Coke Plant, a proposed $3 million to $5 million high-tech museum
near the city's riverfront.
   ``We want to show the stages that Coca-Cola bottling went through
from the beginning of the bottles all the way to the cans and the
talking machines, all the ways it has reflected changes in the
American life,'' said Sandy Wagner, a Boston consultant helping plan
the project.
   Ideally, the museum would be housed in the old downtown Coca-Cola
bottling plant, which now serves as headquarters for the Hamilton
County Board of Education.
   The museum would have a permanent collection of Coca-Cola
memorabilia, show traveling exhibits from Coca-Cola Co. archives in
Atlanta and give audiovisual presentations on Coke history,
marketing and technology.
   Financing for the museum is still up in the air, Brewer said, but
the group will probably seek some assistance from local and state
governments and private donations.
   Last month, Coca-Cola announced plans to build a $10 million
four-story museum in Atlanta called The World of Coca-Cola to
chronicle the history of the 102-year-old soft drink company. That
project is scheduled to open in 1990.
   The Coke Plant would not be sponsored by the Atlanta
conglomerate, but Brewer said Coke officials have expressed support,
and he believes there's room for two attractions.
   ``We're extremely optimistic we can pull it off,'' he said.

   Students stayed home today from schools near a
volcano after it erupted for the first time in 26 years, belching
columns of fire and a plume of smoke that rose to 6,000 feet,
authorities said.
   No casualties or damages were reported from Monday night's
eruption of 6,814-foot Mount Tokachi, about 560 miles north of
Tokyo, and a reported mudslide subsided by this morning.
   The Asahikawa Weather Obervation Station warned local residents
that the volcano could erupt again. Volcanic tremors were
continuing, said a meteorologist who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Ashes from Monday's eruption were found in two cities more than
60 miles northeast of the volcano, he said.
   The eruption countermeasures office in Kamifurano, about 15 miles
from the volcano, said 88 students stayed home today from five
elementary, junior high and high schools within 15 miles of the
mountain.
   Officials said the students live in areas from which quick
evacuation might be difficult, so they are being kept together with
their families.
   When Mount Tokachi erupted in 1926, the heat melted almost all
the snow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people
in two nearby villages.
   A smaller eruption in 1962 killed four people.

   Soviet officials say the immense cost of raising
new cities from the rubble of the Armenian earthquake will slow
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to achieve social and economic
reforms.
   Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Batalin told reporters in the Armenian
capital of Yerevan on Monday that housing construction will begin
next month in the cities and villages destroyed in the Dec. 7 quake,
Tass reported.
   The new buildings will be significantly more resistant to seismic
activity than those that collapsed in the quake, the official news
agency quoted him as saying.
   The quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, leveled the
cities of Leninakan, Kirovakan and Spitak, as well as up to 100
villages, and left more than 500,000 people homeless.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who heads a Politburo
commission overseeing relief efforts, was quoted by Tass as saying
reconstruction will cost much more than the $8.3 billion originally
estimated.
   He called the destruction ``enormous'' and said the disaster and
relief effort dealt a palpable blow to the national economy and
Gorbachev's campaign for change, Tass reported.
   The cost of rebuilding ``will affect the implementation of the
social programs being carried out in the course of economic reform
in the U.S.S.R.'' Ryzhkov said.
   Leninakan and Kirovakan will be rebuilt on the same sites, while
Spitak will be shifted to a spot where there is less danger of
another earthquake, according to Ryzhkov. New buildings will not
exceed three to four stories.
   Almost every building of more than five stories collapsed in the
quake, and officials all the way up to Gorbachev have criticized
shoddy construction they say contributed to a death toll in the tens
of thousands.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda estimated Monday that
40,000-45,000 people were killed in the quake, at least 10,000 fewer
than an earlier toll of 55,000 given by Soviet officials.
   Ryzhkov announced that a government commission was formed to
investigate technical violations in the construction of high-rise
apartments and other buildings in ``an area of seismic danger.''
   Since the quake, thousands of people have been living in tents or
in the open air, and the onset of winter in the Caucasus Mountains
of the southern Soviet Union has dealt survivors and rescue workers
alike one more hardship.
   Snow and freezing temperatures again were forecast for Armenia
today. The Spitak mountain range near the quake zone already is
capped with snow.
   Moscow radio said evacuation of children, women and the elderly
from the earthquake zone was nearing completion. Within days, Pravda
said, only men involved in rebuilding the area should remain.
   Batalin told the Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts
that 70,094 people have been evacuated from the quake zone and that
33,053 have been relocated to holiday resorts.
   The bodies of thousands of people still buried in the rubble pose
the threat of epidemic, and Radio Moscow said survivors in the area
were given medicine ``to make them more resistant to infectious
diseases.''
   No survivors have been found since Saturday, but there has been
no official announcement of an end to the search.
   Because of the staggering damage done by the quake, ``all houses,
factories and farms have to be built anew,'' Radio Moscow said.
   V.I. Chernovanov, deputy chairman of the Soviet agriculture
committee, said preliminary estimates show it will cost $5 billion
just to rebuild wrecked farm buildings, barns and other rural
facilities.
   Gennady A. Yagodin, the government's top education official, told
reporters that ``practically all the schools were destroyed,''
including a Leninakan polytechnical institute that collapsed,
killing 1,000 students and teachers.
   Children must be sent to other areas because the quake wiped out
380 educational institutions, from preschools to technical
institutes, he said.
   Mother Teresa, the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, on Monday
offered the Soviets the assistance of her religious order, the
Missionaries of Charity, which operates orphanages, hospitals and
schools in more than 25 countries.
   Tass did not say whether the Soviets agreed to accept Mother
Theresa's offer. In the past, religious groups have been barred from
engaging in public assistance or operating hospitals, schools and
other social services.

<HEAD>Rescue Team Crawls Four Miles In Cave Before Finding Teens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALENA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers crawled four miles into a cave
in southwest Missouri before finding two teen-agers who were
stranded during an outing the day before, authorities said.
   The 16-year-old boys were reported missing to the Stone County
Sheriff's Department after they didn't return home from a Sunday
afternoon outing at Salt Peter Cave near Galena, 25 miles southwest
of Springfield.
   The names of the boys were not released.
   The parents went to the mouth of the cave Sunday evening and
located a pair of socks and shoes belonging to one of the boys.
   ``One of the boys' father and a friend apparently went in the
cave hoping to find them,'' a sheriff's spokesman said. ``When they
started having trouble with their lights, the father sent the friend
out to get help. But the father stayed in there.''
   It took the Ozark Mountain Cave Search and Rescue Team about two
hours to find all three. They were all out of the cave by about 3
a.m. Monday.
   ``They were tired, cold, wet and dirty, but they were all OK,''
the sheriff's spokesman said.
   The rescuers traveled about four miles before finding the boys.
   ``It doesn't sound like much, except when you consider we were
belly-crawling through 58-degree water most of the way, four miles
is a long way,'' said Bruce Herschend, who led the rescue squad.
``Many places were so tight our backs and bellies were scraping at
the same time.''
   The boys apparently started having trouble with their flashlights
during the expedition, he said. They knew they didn't have enough
light to lead them out of the cave, so they found a dry place and
waited for help.

<HEAD>Singapore To Change Security Law to Outlaw Court Reviews</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it will amend the Internal
Security Act next month to bar courts from challenging its right to
jail people without charge or trial for up to two years.
   The planned amendment is the result of a Dec. 8 appellate court
ruling that released on a technicality four people detained under
the security law. On Monday, the government rejected the court move,
and the four were rearrested.
   ``If Singapore courts review ministerial discretion in security
matters, Singapore judges will in effect become responsible and
answerable for decisions affecting the security of Singapore. This
was not and is not the intention of the legislature as expressed in
the ISA,'' the government statement said.
   Courts have been guided by a 1969 precedent that said detention
cases were outside their purview. The amendment will legally
entrench this precedent.
   Under the Internal Security Act, the government may imprison for
up to two years any citizen who, in the opinion of the home affairs
minister, poses a danger to national security or public order.
   Detention orders can be renewed indefinitely.
   The Dec. 8 decision involved the arrests of lawyer Teo Soh Lung,
39; social worker Kevin De Souza, 27; dramatist Wong Souk Yee, 29;
and teacher Chng Suan Tze, 39. Chng had seven months to serve on his
original detention order and the others six months each.
   They were among 21 people first detained in mid-1987 on charges
of trying to undermine the government as part of a ``clandestine
communist network.''
   The judges reviewing their case said in a 107-page verdict that
the judiciary could review the cases of detainees held under the
security act.
   In rejecting the verdict, the government said Parliament next
month will revise the Internal Security Act with retroactive effect
to say court have no right of review. The governing People's Action
Party controls 80 of the 81 seats in Parliament.

<HEAD>`Twins' No. 1 Movie as Holiday Film Crowds Prefer Comedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holiday moviegoers are favoring comedy over
drama, as the lighthearted ``Twins'' topped the new drama ``Rain
Man,'' according to weekend box-office figures.
   For the second week in a row, ``Twins'' was the nation's most
popular movie, and two comedies, ``The Naked Gun'' and ``Scrooged,''
finished ahead of the serious ``Tequila Sunrise.''
   According to figures issued Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
No. 1 ``Twins,'' focusing on non-identical brothers (Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito) separated at birth, grossed $7.8
million.
   In second place was ``Rain Man,'' the new drama about an autistic
savant (Dustin Hoffman) on the road with his conniving brother (Tom
Cruise). ``Rain Man'' collected $7 million.
   Two other comedies continued strongly, as ``The Naked Gun: From
the Files of Police Squad!'' and ``Scrooged'' finished in third and
fourth place, respectively. ``The Naked Gun'' a spoof of police
movies starring Leslie Nielsen, sold $5.6 million worth of tickets,
while ``Scrooged,'' Bill Murray's comic interpretation of the
Dickens classic, gathered $4.6 million.
   In fifth place was the new comedy ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,''
starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine as dueling con men, opened
weakly with receipts of $3.8 million. It was followed by ``Tequila
Sunrise,'' a drama featuring Mel Gibson as a reformed drug dealer,
which drew $3 million.
   The holiday season's two animated films _ ``Oliver and Co.'' and
``The Land Before Time'' _ finished in seventh and eighth place.
``Oliver and Co.,'' an Oliver Twist-inspired story about a homeless
kitten, grossed $2.3 million. ``The Land Before Time,'' a tale of
baby dinosaurs negotiating a perilous prehistoric world, collected
$1.5 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were the failed ``My Stepmother is an
Alien,'' with Kim Basinger as an extraterrestrial beauty, and
``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' with Jim Varney. ``My Stepmother,''
dropping to ninth place from seventh a week ago, grossed just $1.1
million in its second week of release, while ``Ernest,'' at No. 10,
took in $950,000.
   The holiday film season grows even more frantic this week, as
studios release their ``prestige'' titles to qualify for the Academy
Awards.
   Movies opening this week, some only in selected cities, include
``Beaches,'' ``Working Girl,'' ``Talk Radio,'' ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' ``Burning Secret,''
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown,'' ``The Boost'' and ``Pelle the Conqueror.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Twins,'' Universal, $7.8 million, 1,449 screens, $5,370 per
screen, $22.1 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Rain Man,'' United Artists, $7 million, 1,248 screens,

<HEAD>Relatives of Victims Curse Government On Anniversary Of Ferry
Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people wailed and called
down a curse on the government and a shipping line today in
emotional ceremonies marking the first anniversary of history's
worst peacetime disaster at sea.
   The 300 protesters were marking the Dec. 20, 1987, sinking of the
ferry Dona Paz and the oil tanker Vector, which collided and
exploded off Mindoro island, leaving more than 3,000 people dead.
   ``In the name of all our loved ones, wherever they are, we swear
that all those responsible shall be made to pay for the deaths and
injustices they caused,'' the crowd chanted in unison. ``We will not
lose hope until all those responsible are punished.''
   A presidential commission said at least 3,563 people were aboard
the two ships, but only 26 survived. Survivors and relatives claim
the government and the Dona Paz's owners, Sulpicio Shipping Lines,
have not provided adequate compensation nor taken steps to prevent
other maritime disasters.
   The protesters, including at least four survivors and relatives
of Dona Paz victims, assembled at a Manila's church for a Mass, then
marched toward President Corazon Aquino's office at Malacanang
Palace.
   About 20 police officers and vehicles blocked the marchers at a
bridge about 600 feet from the palace but permitted the marchers to
hold a rally.
   After speeches, the protesters lit candles and set fire to
papier-mache models of the two ships. Two men slit the throats of
two chickens and spattered the models with the blood.
   As the flames triggered firecrackers inside the models, hundreds
wailed and began reciting the curse, traditional among people of the
central Visayas islands from where most of the victims came.
   During the rally, survivor Arnel Galang told the crowd that the
Sulpicio Lines had offered him money to testify that the oil tanker
was at fault but he refused.
   ``They think they can buy lives with their money,'' he said. He
said the survivors were being victimized by owners ``and this
uncaring government.''
   Speaker Ildefonso Aresala, who said he lost his entire family in
the disaster, said his claims for compensation had been bogged down
by paperwork.
   ``I thought the president would be able to help, but I was
mistaken,'' he said. ``There's no clear solution. This is very
painful for us. I don't know what kind of law we have.''
   Other relatives of victims claimed the government was simply
pressuring them into accepting inadequate compensation offered by
the ship owners.
   ``For as long as the government adopts a system that favors the
interests of greedy capitalists, corruption will continue endlessly
and sea travelers will never be safe,'' said one leaflet distributed
in the crowd.
   Nazzer Cajolo, who claimed he lost five brothers in the disaster,
said Sulpicio offered a $7,500 settlement but his family rejected it.
   ``Now they say my brothers are alive,'' he added. ``We want this
government to listen to us and not avoid us.''
   Cajolo is one of about 300 people who have filed a class suit
against Sulpicio Lines, the largest Philippine domestic shipping
company. The suit was rejected by a lower court but an appeal is
pending.
   In October, another Sulpicio passenger ship, the Dona Marilyn,
sank during Typhoon Ruby with about 500 people aboard. About half
those aboard died or are missing.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices rebounded moderately on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.70 yen, up 0.68 yen from Monday's close
of 124.02 yen. After opening at 124.45 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 124.30 to 124.80 yen.
   The U.S. currency's higher opening in Tokyo followed its rise on
the Sydney market, which opened earlier, dealers said.
   Daiwa Bank's Mitsuhiko Kinugasa said the dollar-yen rate hardly
moved in the morning session, but increased dollar-buying by
speculative investors and trading companies in the afternoon pushed
the dollar up.
   ``There was no economic factor in Tokyo that raised the dollar
today, but its firmness on overseas markets encouraged investors'
buying,'' Kinugasa added.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a
66.63-point loser Monday, climbed 97.86 points, or 0.3 percent,
closing at 29,567.94.
   Dealers attributed the index's quick rise in the morning to an
overnight gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York. The
Nikkei gained 151 points in the morning session, but eased somewhat
in the afternoon as buying interest fell, dealers said.
   Most institutional investors were sitting on the sidelines in the
afternoon due to uncertainties over the U.S. discount rate, said a
dealer at one major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Trading was thin with volume on the first section estimated at
650 million shares.

<TEXT>
   Eighteen candidates will vie for the mayor's
office, but the failure of ex-Mayor Jane Byrne and another former
Democratic powerhouse to go after the Republican nomination leaves
the GOP without a big-name contender.
   Mrs. Byrne, a Democrat in the city's top post from 1979 to 1983,
sent word through her daughter to waiting reporters at the Board of
Elections on Monday that she would not pursue the Republican
nomination, as had been rumored.
   ``Jane Byrne is not a candidate. Merry Christmas,'' Kathy Byrne
told reporters, then departed.
   Edward Vrdolyak, a former Cook County Democratic Chairman turned
Republican who also was said to be considering a bid, sent an aide
to tell reporters minutes before Monday's filing deadline for
nomination petitions that he, too, is not interested.
   Seven Democrats and 11 Republicans filed petitions to appear on
the ballot in the Feb. 28 primary election. The April 4 general
election will decide who will complete the remaining two years of
the late Mayor Harold Washington's four-year term. Independent
candidates have until mid-January to file.
   On the Democratic side, Mayor Eugene Sawyer, named to the post by
the City Council after Washington died of a heart attack in November
1987, will square off against Cook County State's Attorney Richard
M. Daley, son of the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley, and Alderman
Timothy Evans.
   Sawyer and Evans, who are black, are battling to represent the
black community, although Daley also has begun campaigning hard for
the black vote. Chicago is slightly more than 40 percent white, 40
percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of other
races.
   Other Democratic candidates are aldermen Lawrence Bloom and Juan
Soliz, former State Sen. James Taylor, and Sheila A. Jones, a
follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   No Republican has been elected mayor since William Hale ``Big
Bill'' Thompson left office in 1931, but a white Republican made a
strong showing against Washington in 1983, when Washington became
the city's first black mayor.
   Mrs. Byrne was derailed in her 1983 re-election bid when she and
Daley split the white vote, allowing Washington to take the
Democratic nomination.
   The decisions by Mrs. Byrne and Vrdolyak not to run was a
disappointment for GOP leaders. Party slate-makers had passed over
all the other candidates who appeared before them at a recent
meeting to leave the door open for Vrdolyak.
   Cook County Republican Chairman James Dvorak said he had been
told Ms. Byrne was likely to enter the race, and he had expressed
support for a Vrdolyak bid, calling him the best potential candidate
and ``a man of vision.''
   ``Leaders in the Republican party urged me to consider a
candidacy and I did so as a courtesy to my party,'' Vrdolyak told
reporters through an aide. ``Instead I will concentrate my time and
energy on my law practice and on assisting to build the Republican
party in Chicago and Cook County.''
   The most prominent name in the Republican field is Dr. Herbert
Sohn, a physician-lawyer who three times unsuccessfully challenged
longtime U.S. Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill.
   ``I was interviewed on Channel 11 (WTTW-TV) this evening and the
newsmen called me the Republican front-runner,'' Sohn said in a
telephone interview late Monday. ``They even said I was way ahead of
all the other candidates. I couldn't believe it.''
   Sohn's primary opponents include Kenneth R. Hurst, who filed an
unsuccessful lawsuit to try to get the election put off until 1991;
and John J. Holowinski, a former Democrat employed by the city's
Department of Economic Development.

   A police officer who survived a gunshot
blast to the chest in 1986 and saved a man from an ax-wielding
assailant in 1985 collapsed and died while jogging.
   Ramiro Olvera Jr., 27, who received 19 commendations in less than
five years in uniform, collapsed as he jogged Monday morning.
   ``It's a terrible loss to the city and everyone who knew him,''
said Police Chief Jim Everett. ``We have lost a very fine young
officer who will be difficult to replace.''
   Dr. Robert Bayardo, Travis County medical examiner, said an
aneurysm in the right side of the officer's brain burst. An aneurysm
is a balloon-type swelling of a blood vessel, Bayardo said.
   In December 1985, Olvera and another officer were forced to shoot
a man who was attacking another man with an ax at a housing project.
The attacker died and the officers were credited with saving the
life of the intended victim.
   Only two months later, Olvera stopped a burglary suspect who had
been fleeing from officers by ramming his patrol car into the
suspect's car.
   In 1986, a man whom Olvera was frisking pulled out a gun and
fired at Olvera's chest. The bullet was deflected by a bulletproof
vest.
   Olvera's work earned him the title of 1986 Officer of the Year
from a local club and 1986 Central Texas Law Officer of the Year
from a law enforcement group.
   Olvera in 1987 joined the Hispanic Crimes Unit, a team of
investigators who gained a reputation for solving tough crimes.

   Jury selection is underway in the trial of
five of the 13 civil rights leaders arrested for trying to block a
City Council meeting in June.
   More than 20 jurors were interviewed Monday as city prosecutors
and defense lawyers tried to seat an eight-member panel in Municipal
Court.
   The five ministers on trial are each charged with one count of
obstructing official business. The charge is a second-degree
misdemeanor, with a maximum sentence of three months in jail and a
$750 fine.
   The five defendants are among 13 ministers and civil rights
leaders who were arrested after they refused to leave City Council
chambers during the protest of the city's handling of problems in
its Community Development Department. One black Community
Development Department official was fired, another resigned, one
retired and one was reassigned because of alleged mismanagment of
the city's housing programs.
   The civil rights leaders wanted to know why the men were
reprimanded without being consulted about problems in the
department. They also asked for a public hearing into the
allegations.
   Their requests were rejected by city officials and that sparked
months of protest by civil rights leaders, who claim there is a
conspiracy against black officials in Toledo.
   The other eight defendants are scheduled for trial next month.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air-India Boeing 747 flew to London
without a single passenger after a six-hour delay prompted ticket
holders to switch to another flight, an airline spokesman said today.
   ``We have no control on the passengers. When the plane was
delayed, they opted for another flight,'' said K.S. Mahatre, chief
public relations officer of the state-run airline.
   There was no reason given for the delay. The 60 to 70 passengers
booked on Monday's flight from Bombay switched to another Air-India
plane that stopped in London and continued on to New York, Mahatre
said.
   ``We had no option but to fly the aircraft empty because we are a
scheduled airline and can't just cancel because there is no
passenger,'' Mahatre said when contacted by telephone at the
airline's headquarters in Bombay.
   The jumbo jet, capable of carrying 264 passengers, carried a
14-member crew and 34 tons of cargo. It cost the airline $54,000 to
make the one-way flight to London, Mahatre said. He didn't know how
much of that was offset by the cargo.
   ``The plane's return flight is fully booked, so we do not look
that bad,'' he said.

   Four million people have visited the Mormon
Church's historic Temple Square this year, the most visitors the
center has recorded in a single year, an official said.
   Teresa Hughes of Kingsport, Tenn., was singled out as the
4-millionth visitor Monday as she and her husband, Stephen, strolled
through the gates of the 10-acre, walled-in city block, said Temple
Square director Joseph F. Horne.
   The couple was treated to a special tour of the grounds and
accepted gifts from local merchants, state and county officials and
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   Home of the Mormon Temple, Mormon Tabernacle and visitors

   ``We've never reached the 4-million mark in any previous year,''
Horne said. ``In fact, last year was the previous record year for
visitors, and the 3-million milestone was reached on Dec. 3, so
we're way ahead of any previous year.''

<HEAD>Government Announces Amnesty For Political Offenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today announced an
amnesty for more than 2,000 ``politically motivated offenders,''
including two who were serving 20-year sentences for burning a U.S.
government building.
   The Justice Ministry said the clemency was approved at a special
Cabinet session.
   Ministry officials said 281 prisoners would be released
Wednesday, including Kim Hyun-jang and Moon Boo-shik, who were
serving 20-year sentences for leading a raid on the U.S. Cultural
Center in the southern city of Pusan in early 1982.
   Protesters set fire to the building to protest U.S. support for
the government of then-President Chun Doo-hwan. One person was
killed and three were wounded.
   Another 1,581 people already freed on parole will have their
civil rights restored Wednesday, 92 prisoners will have their
sentences reduced, and 61 people who were sought by police will be
taken off the wanted list, authorities said..
   Among those who will be granted restoration of civil rights is
prominent dissident Kim Kun-tae, who was freed from prison in June,
He received the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights in April.
   Kim was sentenced to five years in prison in 1986 for inciting
unrest, but supporters alleged he was forced to confess by police
torture.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said in a statement that the
leniency was a ``bold step intended to heal the depressing wounds of
the past era and thus to promote democratization.''
   He said the action was taken through consultations with all major
political parties, as had been promised by President Roh Tae-woo.
Roh pledged on Nov. 26 to release many political prisoners and
institute other reforms to dissociate himself from Chun, his
predecessor.
   The main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy said the
government amnesty was an important step toward democratization, but
party officials said there were still 60 more political prisoners to
be freed.
   The Reunification Democratic Party, another opposition group,
welcomed the measure, but dissident groups charged that Roh betrayed
his promise for a total release of political prisoners by excluding
about 300 political prisoners, mostly involved in movements for
workers and depressed people.
   Government officials disagreed and claimed the figure was about
200 who were involved mostly in communist spy cases and other
anti-state activities.

<HEAD>Ex-Recruit Executive Pleads Guilty to Attempted Bribery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former executive pleaded guilty today to attempted
bribery in the only case to come to criminal trial so far in a
widening scandal over transactions in his company's stock involving
leading politicians and businessmen.
   Hiroshi Matsubara, former chief aide to the president of
Recruit-Cosmos Co., admitted trying to bribe an opposition lawmaker
who was investigating his company's role in the scandal.
   ``I admit all charges. They are all factual,'' Kyodo News Service
quoted Matsubara as telling the Tokyo District Court. ``I deeply
regret my action and decided to accept charges in order to make a
new start in my life.''
   He also reiterated his earlier statement that he was acting on
his own and that Recruit-Cosmos, a real estate subsidiary of Recruit
Co., had no part in the attemted bribery. Recruit is an information
service conglomerate.
   ``It was all done by myself and the money came from my own
savings and loans from my friends,'' Kyodo quoted him as saying.
   The Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office arrested Matsubara on Oct. 20
for allegedly trying to give a $40,320 bribe to Parliament member
Yanosuke Narazaki, the leading investigator of the scandal.
   Narazaki, of the opposition United Social Democratic Party, filed
a complaint with prosecutors saying he had been offered the cash in
exchange for toning down his investigations and questioning in
Parliament.
   The prosecution charged today that Matsubara acted out of fear
that Narazaki's investigation might damage Recruit-Cosmos as well as
people who bought unlisted shares and then profited when public
trading of the stock began.
   The scandal has led to the resignation of several goverment
officials and business leaders, including Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Hisashi Shinto, chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Co.
   The transactions in the unlisted Recruit-Cosmos shares were legal
under Japanese law, but questions of ethics were raised against
politicians and public officials who took advantage of their
influence to earn handsome profits.
   The case also highlighted a traditionally intimate link between
politicians and business circles in Japan.
   Public anger in the wake of the scandal led Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita to set up a committee to study possible revision of laws
regulating political fund-raising activities.
   Another controversy erupted over Narazaki allowing a television
camera into his residence to record the bribery offer. Nippon
Television Broadcasting Network broadcast the tape on an evening
news program.
   Following Narazaki's complaint, prosecutors confiscated the tape
from Nippon Television as evidence. The company fiercely protested
the action, saying it interfered with freedom of the press.
   Narazaki could face up to three years in prison on the bribery
charge.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are two Quacks now but no Mack.
   The mystery of the purloined duckling deepened on Monday when a
bronze duck stolen from a children's sculpture in the Boston Public
Garden more than a year ago was left at the Statehouse for police to
find.
   But it was the wrong duck.
   To restore the sculpture, thieves must return a different
duckling that was swiped on Dec. 10th.
   ``We're delighted to have Quack back but Mack is still missing,''
said the sculptor, Nancy Schon of suburban Newton.
   She pleaded with the culprit to return Mack the duck before
Christmas.
   Mack and Quack are two of eight bronze ducklings shown waddling
after their mother in a sculpture dramatizing Robert McCloskey's
well-known children's story, ``Make Way for Ducklings.'' In the
story, a family of ducks wanders around the Beacon Hill neighborhood
before a friendly policeman helps them find a home in the Public
Garden.
   Quack, the eighth duckling in the line, was stolen from the
Garden while the cement was still setting on the sculpture in
September 1987, Schon said.
   She replaced it and the ducklings remained untouched for more
than a year. But this Dec. 10, while walking in the Garden, Schon
noticed that Mack, the fourth duck in the line, had disappeared.
   It had been cut off at the feet, apparenty with a blow torch,
leaving only a telltale trace of bronze on the cobblestone.
   The ducklings each weigh about 30 pounds and are worth about
$3,000.
   On Monday morning, Schon got a call from a friend saying the
duckling had been found. A caller led police to the duck, which was
in a cardboard box.
   ``I was joyous,'' she said. ``But when I went down to the police
station I discovered it was not Mack but Quack.''

   Seven-year-old Ralph Brooks Jr. wiped tears
from his eyes and told jurors how he fell paralyzed on his
grandmother's doorstep while trying to flee gunfire in a drug war
last summer.
   ``I was running to my grandmom's house ... I got to my front door
and I fell down on my stomach and I couldn't feel anything,'' the
boy said in response to gentle questioning by Assistant District
Attorney Rayford Means.
   The child was unable to identify the defendant, Lonnie Summers,
21, as the gunman in the July 12 shooting, which has become a
rallying point for residents fighting to reclaim their neighborhoods
from drug dealers.
   After testifying Monday, the child told Common Pleas Judge Marvin
Halbert he felt ``fine'' after months of rehabilitation. The judge
then shook his hand and wished him a Merry Christmas, earning a
smile and a ``thanks'' from Ralph.
   Summers' lawyer acknowledged the testimony would hurt his case,
even if the boy didn't know who shot him.
   ``It's just the emotion that's involved, the sympathy that's
generated. The jurors are human beings,'' attorney Nino Tinari said.
   Summers, charged with aggravated assault and weapons violations,
has been held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail. If convicted, he
faces a maximum sentence of 30 years.
   The little boy, a second-grade public school student, has become
a symbol in the city's war against drug trafficking. More than
$43,000 already has been contributed for his future education.
   Ralph, who is paralyzed below the waist, came into the courtroom
in a wheelchair. He stared at the jury and then at the defendant,
and tears began to flow as the judge and opposing lawyers discussed
privately whether his testimony would be relevant and competent.
   The judge left the bench and sat beside the child, holding a
microphone, while the youngster answered preliminary questions.
   ``Do you know the difference between right and wrong?'' asked
Means.
   ``Yes,'' the boy replied.
   ``What happens when you tell a lie?''
   ``You get punished,'' he said.
   The judge then cut in, saying, ``I am perfectly satisfied with
the competence of this witness.''
   Ralph then told how he was playing with his 9-year-old sister
Nashira and several children a few houses from his grandmother's
home when the shooting began.
   Nashira Brooks, a fourth grader, testified that she tried to grab
Ralph and pull him into a neighbor's house but he broke loose.
   ``I heard the shots, pow, pow, pow ... they sounded like
firecrackers, only louder,'' she said.
   Moments later, she said, she came outside and saw him lying on
his stomach and screaming.
   Tinari acknowledged Summers might have been in the neighborhood
when warring drug dealers exchanged gunfire, but he said Summers did
not fire the shot that severed Ralph's spine and left him paralyzed
below the waist.

   The dollar rose in thin early European trading
today. Gold prices fell slightly.
   Foreign currency dealers said the continuing possibility of an
increase in the U.S. discount rate was providing support for the
dollar.
   ``No one wants to be caught without dollars if the Fed (U.S.
Federal Reserve) moves,'' said one dealer with a major Italian
commercial bank in Milan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.68 yen to a closing 124.70. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.7745 West German marks, up from 1.7625
   _1.5000 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870
   _6.0635 French francs, up from 6.0235

   _1,302.50 Italian lire, up from 1,296.00
   _1.2005 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1995
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8110, cheaper for buyers
than late Monday's $1.8230.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.90 a troy ounce,
down from $414.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $412.20, down from $412.25 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 5 cents to close at a bid
$415.67.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.10 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $6.08.

   Soviet officials have received more foreign aid
shipments than they can handle and donors should focus instead on
sending money for rehabilitation of earthquake victims, Red Cross
officials said.
   They called Monday for suspension of aid shipments to Armenia
until further notice. There have been about 140 foreign relief
flights.
   Two-thirds of 27,000 rail cars that carried relief material to
the earthquake-stricken region have yet to be unloaded, said Per
Stenbaeck, secretary-general of the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies.
   Another league official, Andrei Kisselev, said that due to a lack
of international coordination the donor response has been ``far too
generous.''
   ``I think there are more kidney dialysis machines per capita in
Armenia than anywhere in the world,'' Kisselev said, citing news
reports that said up to 75 machines were sent to the Soviet Union
while only 20 were requested.
   They briefed reporters after returning from a two-day trip to
Yerevan to check on the relief operations for victims from the Dec.
7 earthquake.
   ``We shouldn't send more supplies,'' Stenbaeck said. ``And when I
hear that dog teams were sent on Saturday or Sunday, I must
protest.'' He said the Soviets will have to return some of the
donations.
   International donations should focus on money for rehabilitation,
particularly workshops to manufacture artificial limbs, Stenbaeck
said. Orthopedic centers are needed for 4,000 people who lost limbs,
according to Stenbaeck.
   Officials in Armenia, however, are evaluating whether winter
tents and additional transportation are still needed, he said. About
53,000 tents are in the area, according to Soviet figures quoted by
the league.
   Stenbaeck said he met with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, and they agreed that stronger coordination between
governments and private organizations is needed to ensure an
efficient emergency program.
   Ryzhkov also ``realized there is a need for rather thorough
changes in the disaster response system in the Soviet Union,''
Stenbaeck said.
   ``Nobody has overall view of what has been sent off,'' Stenbaeck
said of the global effort. ``It took a week to find out what has
been stored in warehouses.''
   The league, an arm of the International Red Cross, combines 147
national societies and musters worldwide relief in case of disasters.
   In Ankara, Turkey, the Soviet Embassy issued a list of
construction material needed for rebuilding. The list included
ceramic tiles, washstands and tubs for kitchens and bathrooms.

   Elvis Presley fans still holding tickets
for two 1977 concerts canceled because of his death can get refunds
soon, the state director of unclaimed property said.
   Presley, who died on Aug. 16, 1977, at his home in Memphis, was
scheduled for hometown performances on Aug. 27 and 28.
   Many of the fans who bought tickets for those shows, for $12.50
to $15 each, have never gotten their money back and it has been held
in a savings account, said Darrell May, director of the Mid-South
Coliseum.
   The unclaimed ticket money, which originally totaled $150,000,
has grown with interest to some $411,000, May said.
   In 1982, the Presley estate and the promoters of the concerts
filed suit to get the money, but a state Court of Appeals ruled last
week that ticket holders have first crack at it.
   Susan Clayton, director of the state's division of unclaimed
property, said ticket holders will probably be allowed to keep them
once presenting them to claim refunds.
   ``I understand there is some sentimental value to these
tickets,'' she said from her office in Nashville.

   Two East German brothers fled to West Berlin early
today, climbing over border barriers as Communist guards fired
flares but refrained from using their weapons, West Berlin police
said.
   The brothers, aged 28 and 26, reached a U.S. guard post unharmed
and were turned over to West Berlin police.
   The escape occurred in the southern West Berlin district of
Lichterfelde, police said.
   Nearly 500 East Germans have escaped to West Berlin or West
Germany this year, compared with 288 in all of 1987, according to
official West German figures.

<TEXT>
   The release of a woman jailed for refusing
to disclose the whereabouts of her son was blocked when U.S. Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist stayed a Maryland Court of
Appeals order.
   Acting at the request of the state attorney general's office,
Rehnquist stayed the appelate ruling Monday pending a response from
Jacqueline Bouknight's attorneys by noon Wednesday, said Supreme
Court spokeswoman Toni House.
   Maryland's highest court had ruled 5-2 earlier Monday that
Circuit Judge David B. Mitchell violated Ms. Bouknight's
constitutional protection against self-incrimination by sending her
to jail.
   Mitchell found Ms. Bouknight, 21, guilty of contempt for refusing
to tell social workers last April where they could find her
27-month-old son, Maurice. She has remained in jail sine then.
   The Department of Social Services put the child in foster care
after he was admitted to a hospital on Jan. 23, 1987, at the age of
three months with a broken leg and several partially healed
fractures.
   The department returned the child to Ms. Bouknight the following
August when she agreed not to physically punish the boy and to
undergo training in how to be a parent.
   Last April, the department filed a petition saying the child had
not been seen since September 1987 and that Ms. Bouknight had
refused to disclose his whereabouts. The petition also said the
boy's father had been shot to death and that Ms. Bouknight had a
history of drug abuse.
   The appeals court's majority opinion by Chief Judge Robert Murphy
noted that prosecutors fear Maurice is dead or has been abused.
   ``The state readily acknowledges that Bouknight's risk of
incriminating herself is a substantial one, encompassing, among
other possible crimes, the felony of child abuse and even murder,''
Murphy said, adding that the court can't ignore her constitutional
protection against self-incrimination.
   A dissenting opinion by judges James McAuliffe and Lawrence
Rodowsky rejected the notion that she would be incriminating herself
by revealing her son's whereabouts.
   The state's brief in the case argued that the importance of
protecting the child outweighed Ms. Bouknight's right not to
incriminate herself.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of Prime Minister Olof Palme,
the only witness to her husband's assassination, identified the
killer from a videotape last week, a newspaper reported today.
   The account by Lisbet Palme was the main evidence that persuaded
a Stockholm district court to order that Christer Pettersson, 41, be
held in custody Friday, said the report by the Aftonbladet newspaper.
   Prosecutors, police and Pettersson's defense attorney refused
comment on the report. Prosecutor Jorgen Almblad complained that
publicity about the case could put Mrs. Palme's life in danger.
   Swedish television also reported Monday that Mrs. Palme had
identified the gunman, but it gave no details.
   Palme, who was prime minister for 11 years, was gunned down on a
downtown Stockholm street while walking home from a movie with his
wife the night of Feb. 28, 1986. Mrs. Palme was grazed by a second
bullet.
   Aftonbladet said two other witnesses identified Pettersson as the
man seen loitering outside the Grand Theater before the killing.
   Pettersson pleaded innocent at his arraignment, but the court
found the prosecution had shown ``reasonable grounds for suspicion''
he committed the murder.
   Defense attorney Arne Liljeros has indicated he will argue
against the reliability of eyewitness accounts after a nearly
three-year time lapse. Failure to find the murder weapon, a .357
magnum revolver, also could complicate the prosecution, news reports
said.
   Pettersson, who has a long record of violent crimes and a history
of drug and alcohol abuse, was picked up Wednesday after nearly a
three-year manhunt.
   Aftonbladet said Mrs. Palme was reluctant to go through with the
identification and relive the shooting but was persuaded ``by people
outside the investigation'' to see a videotape.
   Mrs. Palme has persistently refused to publicly discuss the hunt
for her husband's killer.

<HEAD>Results Released In Campaign Against Corrupt Foreign Trade</HEAD>

   Chinese officials who deal with foreign countries
are the target of a massive anti-corruption campaign to remove their
fingers from the public till, the nation's leading newspaper
reported today.
   In all, 7,200 officials, 56 of whom were described as
high-ranking government officials, have been punished in the
campaign, the People's Daily said. Of these, 1,100 officials have
had their cases referred to the nation's courts for criminal
prosecution, it said.
   In one case, an engineer in the Ministry of Railroads gave a
foreign business classified documents about China's technological
needs. In return, he was able to send his children to study in
Japan, according to the report.
   In another case, 71 workers at an aluminum factory took 14 trips
to the United States, France, Italy and Japan to research a single
deal. In all, they spent $216,000 of government money on the trips,
the newspaper said.
   ``In reality it was pure jobbery, using public funds for a
tourist trip,'' the paper said.
   On Sunday, the paper reported that 30,000 inspectors were working
in 3,000 officies nationwide to fight Chinese corruption in dealing
with foreign companies.
   In all, 1.7 million foreign trade contracts involving $150
billion have been examined by officials, the paper said.
   Since the campaign began in June 1987, investigators have opened
15,600 cases, of which 7,500 have been solved, the paper said.
   ``In its work concerning foreign trade, China has some major weak
links and loopholes,'' the People's Daily said. ``There really do
exist some corrupt officials doing international trade. Politically
and economically, they create a very bad impression.''
   Corruption is one of the major problems China faces as it
attempts to open its economy to the West. Western companies wishing
to do business in China are often forced by corrupt officials to pay
bribes or offer gifts just for the chance to do business with
Beijing.
   Internal corruption in China has also been blamed for causing
price rises. Illegal companies, often set up by sons and daughters
of powerful officials, buy goods at wholesale rates and sell them
for a profit, increasing the goods' price.
   China's inflation hovers at about 20 percent to 30 percent, the
highest since the revolution in 1949.

   Fire destroyed a large downtown
department store, and officials said today they were investigating
possible links with arson attacks at four other department stores.
   No injuries were reported in any of the incidents, which occurred
late Monday and early today in London, the Welsh city of Cardiff and
the southwestern town of Plymouth, about 200 miles from London.
   No group claimed responsibility in any of the incidents, but the
domestic news agency Press Association noted that animal rights
activists opposed to the sale of furs have planted incendiary
devices in the past at some of the targeted stores.
   The fire at Dingles department store in the center of Plymouth
gutted the 150-foot-high building. A total of 140 firemen battled
for six hours to put out the flames.
   The blaze broke out late Monday after the 450 employees had gone
home, fire officials said. Walls of the building collapsed, piling
tons of rubble on fire engines at the scene.
   ``We have no indication as to how it started yet. It is one of
the worst fires I have ever seen in the city center,'' said the
police department's chief investigator, Roger Mechan.
   Scotland Yard said incendiary devices started small fires at
Harrods department store in London's Knightsbridge district and at
Selfridges, another large London department store, shortly after
midnight.
   In each case, the device had been hidden down the side of a sofa
in the furniture department, investigators said. They said damage
was limited to the sofas.
   Similar incidents occurred at both stores in April.
   Scotland Yard bomb squad officers also defused an incendiary
device found at the House of Fraser store on Oxford Street before it
went off.
   In Cardiff in Wales late Monday, a fire broke out in the menswear
department at the Howells department store, police said. The fire
was quickly put out, according to a police statement.
   ``There is no indication as to the cause, but obviously it is
being treated as suspicious,'' the statement said.
   It said South Wales police would be talking with police in London
and Plymouth to see if there was a link between the fires and
discovery of incendiary devices.

<HEAD>Pope Names Berlin Cardinal To Cologne and Ends Standoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today appointed Berlin
Cardinal Joachim Meisner to head the Roman Catholic archdiocese of
Cologne in West Germany, one of the most influential church posts in
Europe.
   The appointment ended a 15-month standoff between the Vatican and
clerics in Cologne.
   Meisner was reportedly long backed by the pope but had been
opposed by some clerics in Cologne who are given a say in the
selection process under a 1929 agreement between the Vatican and the
state of Prussia.
   Reports from Germany said some Cologne churchmen viewed Meisner
as too conservative. Several West German politicians also spoke out
against the pope insisting on his man.
   However, last Friday the clerics of the 16-member Cologne chapter
elected Meisner, clearing the way for Tuesday's Vatican announcement.
   Meisner, who will be 55 on Christmas, lives in East Berlin but is
bishop of both sides of the divided city. He has served as Berlin
bishop since April 1980 and was promoted to cardinal by John Paul
three years later.
   The Cologne archbishop's post has been vacant since Cardinal
Joseph Hoeffner retired in September 1987. He died one month later.
   The Vatican announcement gave no hint of the controversy
surrounding the nomination. It noted, however, that the appointment
was made in conformity with the 1929 agreement.
   On Dec. 10, the Vatican made a rare public statement about an
archbishop's appointment, declaring that the pope had the right to
name the Cologne prelate even if the local church was opposed to his
choice.
   Cologne is considered particularly influential because its
archbishop has traditionally headed the West German bishops
conference. The Roman Catholic Church in West Germany wields
considerable influence at the Vatican and is the major financial
contributor after the United States.

<HEAD>Company That Owns Song `Happy Birthday To You' Sold For $25 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company that owns the song ``Happy Birthday
to You'' is being sold for $25 million to the largest music
publisher in the world, according to a report published today.
   Birchtree Ltd., which owns the birthday song, will soon be
acquired by Warner Chappell, which owns the rights to songs by
George and Ira Gershwin, Michael Jackson, Cole Porter, and Gilbert
and Sullivan, according to The New York Times.
   Warner Chappell is a division of Warner Communications Inc.
   Birchtree, of Princeton, N.J., was put up for sale in October, in
part because the company said it did not have the resources to
monitor and protect its copyrights as larger companies do, the Times
said.
   Technically, a royalty should be paid every time the birthday
song is sung in public, but the company has never monitored that
kind of use.
   ``Happy Birthday'' generates about $1 million a year in royalty
fees.
   Royalties were paid, for example, when the song was used in the
films ``10,''``The Great Santini,''``Oh God'' and ``Fame.''
   ``Happy Birthday to You'' was based on a melody composed in the
1890s by two kindergarten teachers in Louisville, Ky. The song's
lyrics were written later and the song was not copyrighted until
1935. When the copyright expires in 2010, Warner will no longer be
entitled to royalties.
   Birchtree owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700 are actively
collecting royalty fees, the Times said.

<HEAD>UNICEF: Debt Crisis Responsible For Half A Million Child Deaths
Annually</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with report released, Grant quotes. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half a million children died in
16 developing nations last year because their debt-burdened
governments have had to cut back on social spending, UNICEF said
today in its annual report.
   UNICEF Executive Director James P. Grant called for a world
summit to save an estimated 3 million children who he said die each
year from easily preventable diseases.
   Formally releasing the report during a worldwide telecast, he
said leaders of industrialized and developing nations should
participate in the summit.
   Grant said cuts in social spending have led to problems that
overshadow substantial progress made by most developing nations in
health and education in the past decade.
   ``Three million children died last year because they didn't have
50 cents worth of vaccine in them,'' Grant told a televised news
conference relayed to 40 countries. He said 1.5 million of these
deaths occurred in South Asia.
   Grant said he proposed the summit because the way to reach the
victims is to first reach their leaders.
   In the UNICEF annual report, ``The State of the World's Children
1989,'' Grant cited the debts incurred by developing nations and
said: ``By far, the heaviest consequences are being borne by the
children.''
   Throughout most of Africa and much of Latin America, average
incomes have fallen by 10 percent to 25 percent in the 1980s, the
report says. In the 37 poorest nations, per capita spending on
health has dropped by 50 percent and on education by 25 percent over
the last few years, it adds.
   ``Children are facing the worst of times and potentially the best
of times. It is the worst of times because 35 years of progress is
being threatened by falling commodity prices, mismanagement and the
debt crisis,'' Grant told reporters in New Delhi before releasing
the report.
   ``A country can do incredible things with a small amount of money
as long as the economy holds together. When a country's economy
starts having trouble, the children are always the ones who will
suffer the most,'' he said.
   Ten deeply indebted Latin American and Caribbean nations and six
in Africa have experienced a slowing down in the reduction of
mortality in children under age 5 from 1980 to 1987, compared with
the 1970s.
   ``For these 16 countries alone, the number of child deaths in the
last 12 months is approximately 650,000 more than would have been
the case if the 1970-80 rate of decline in under-five mortality had
continued,'' said Grant.
   He said the majority of these deaths are related to ``the slowing
down or reversal of the development process during the 1980s, which
is a result of unprecedented borrowing, rising interest rates,
falling commodity prices, inadequate investment of borrowed funds,
and the domestic and international management of the resulting debt
crisis.''
   According to the UNICEF report, ``the developing world is now
transferring $20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it
receives in new aid and loans.'' Developing nations owe an estimated
$1.2 trillion to private banks, development funds, and other
countries.
   At the beginning of the 1980s, less than 5 percent of the Third
World's children were immunized and diseases such as whooping cough,
measles and tetanus killed up to 5 million children annually, the
report says.
   Now, more than half the developing world's children are immunized
and vaccines save the lives of about 1.5 million of them each year,
Grant reports.
   A new UNICEF goal is the immunization of pregnant women against
tetanus, which extends protection to their newborns. The report says
just 25 percent of them are now immunized, and tetanus kills more
than 800,000 infants annually.
   In 1980, the World Health Organization launched a campaign to
reduce the death rate from dehydration caused by diarrhea, which
then claimed the lives of 4 million children annually.
   By promoting the use of inexpensive Oral Rehydration Salts, a
simple method for preventing almost all dehydration deaths, 112
nations now are saving the lives of up to 1 million children
annually, the report says.

   David Cobb, the former radio announcer
credited with coining Nashville's nickname _ ``Music City, U.S.A.''
_ died following heart surgery. He was 76.
   The veteran announcer died Saturday in Park View Medical Center;
he underwent surgery Wednesday.
   Cobb was affiliated with WSM Inc. from 1937 to 1972, and, with
Louie Buck and Judd Collins, was one of the first three announcers
at the Grand Ole Opry.
   An account in the Nov. 5, 1964, edition of The Nashville
Tennessean said Cobb ad-libbed an announcement during a 1960 program
that ``the sounds listeners were hearing on WSM radio were coming
from `Music City, USA.'''
   ``He had a vast store of classical knowledge and, for years,
hosted every music show on the station,'' including a Sunday night
show on classical music, WSM production manager Tom Bryant said.
   He is survived by his wife, one son and three grandchildren.

<HEAD>Official Says Ruble Exchange Rate Won't Go Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top trade official in the Soviet government
today denied the ruble will be devalued by 50 percent in 1990, as
had been widely assumed in the West from Soviet media reports in the
past two weeks.
   The newspaper articles, starting with one in Sovietskaya
Industria, or Soviet Industry, had said the ruble exchange rate
would fall by 50 percent ``on trade deals'' starting Jan. 1, 1990.
Western economists and businessmen assumed this meant a drop from
the current government-decreed exchange rate of $1.60 per ruble to
80 cents per ruble.
   But that applies only to the ruble's value in domestic deals
among Soviet enterprises, not to its value in trade with foreigners,
Vladimir Kamentsev, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and
head of the State Foreign Economic Commission, told a press briefing.
   ``This should not be taken as a change in the ruble standard
versus foreign currency,'' Kamentsev said.
   He said the 50 percent change applies only to exchanges of
foreign currency between various Soviet businesses, government-owned
and cooperative.
   A Western diplomat, who declined to be named, noted at the time
of the original report that it did not say which exchange rate would
drop, a critical distinction as the Soviet Union reputedly has 3,000
different exchange rates for different products and different
trading partners. Kamentsev refused to clarify that question.
   Kamentsev said, however, that the current change is one step in
the direction of a ruble that someday will be freely convertible to
foreign currency. He declined to name a date for convertibility, but
said it would come after a major price reform.
   Rubles now are virtually worthless outside the Soviet Union. The
Soviet government sells rubles to tourists and businessmen at a rate
of $1.60 per ruble, but the black market rate is 25 to 30 cents per
ruble.
   Kamentsev also said that starting next year, Soviet enterprises
will be allowed to trade their foreign currency with other Soviet
businesses in a thrice-yearly currency auction. However, he did not
explain how the apparently open prices of an auction would co-exist
with a set rate.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministers Hold Heated Talks on Territorial Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet and Japanese foreign ministers held
heated talks today over a territorial dispute but made no progress,
and Japan rebuffed Soviet feelers on increased economic cooperation,
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his counterpart,
Sousuke Uno, were to give separate news conferences Wednesday before
Shevardnadze leaves for the Philippines, and officials of the two
countries were drafting a jiong communique.
   But it appeared unlikely that progress could be realized on the
major issue blocking improved relations _ Soviet possession of the
Kuril islands off northern Japan that Tokyo insists should be
returned.
   The only positive sign was a possibility that the two countries
would agree to continue talks at the official level on the dispute,
which dates back to World War II.
   ``Neither side has shown concessions, so the positions are still
far apart,'' Seiichi Kondo, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman,
told reporters in a review of two days of talks between the two
foreign ministers.
   Shevardnadze, in a speech Tuesday night to a private group,
called for an improvement in relations.
   ``We can open up a new chapter in the history of Soviet-Japanese
relations, and then again they must be opened up,'' he said. ``If
there are problems that cannot be solved between us, we must search
for the clue to a solution through talks, dialogue.''
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Uno was likely to visit Moscow for renewed talks in
the first half of 1989.
   Kondo said the Soviets had suggested the two countries study
measures to encourage economic cooperation, such as agreements to
protect investments and set guidelines on economic relations.
   The Japanese replied that, in addition to problems in the Soviet
investment climate, ``the overall situation of bilateral relations
is not suitable for further promotion of investment,'' Kondo said.
   His report on the talks appeared to dash speculation that a
Soviet need for Japanese investment to help develop the Soviet
economy _ especially the vast and resource-rich Siberian region in
the Soviet Far East _ would spur progress on the territorial issue.
   Kondo said the two foreign ministers' talks on the territorial
issue were ``frank, serious and heated.''
   Moscow has consolidated its occupation of the Kurils, which guard
Moscow's access to the Pacific, with 10,000 troops. Japan maintains
that it pioneered settlement of the islands _ 17,000 Japanese
residents were ousted by invading Soviet troops in 1945 _ and has a
historic claim to them.
   Earlier, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita urged Shevardnadze to
give ``serious consideration'' to the territorial dispute, a Foreign
Ministry official said.
   Takeshita said resolution of the dispute ``would be the basis for
permanent and stable relations.''
   Shevardnadze met with the Japanese prime minister to deliver a
letter from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The contents of
the letter were not made public.
   Shevardnadze said Gorbachev has a trip to Japan on his political
schedule and that Takeshita was welcome to visit Moscow, the
Japanese official said. No dates were mentioned.
   In a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint declaration, Moscow announced its
willingness to return two of the islands upon conclusion of a peace
treaty.
   But at the last Japan-Soviet summit in 1973, talks between then
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev broke
down over the issue. Shevardnadze refused to discuss it during his
last visit to Japan in 1986.

<HEAD>Gandhi Says India Will Not Interfere in Tibet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and China's
president, Yang Shangkun, today discussed China's troubled region of
Tibet, and Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's
internal affairs.
   The Indian leader spent much of his second day in China
sightseeing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Yang explained China's
position on Tibet to Gandhi during a one-hour meeting at the Great
Hall of the People.
   Yang, 81, who has held the largely ceremonial post of president
since April, stressed that the Beijing government provides
assistance to the Tibetan region, one of China's most backward areas.
   ``We respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the
Tibetan people, and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief,''
Yang said.
   Gandhi repeated India's position that Tibet is an autonomous
region of China and that India will not interfere in China's
internal affairs, Xinhua said.
   The Tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the
two countries because India has provided refuge to the Tibetan
religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and his followers, who have
demanded independence for Tibet. The Dalai Lama fled to India in
1959 after he led a failed uprising against Chinese military forces.
   At least one Tibetan monk was shot and killed by Chinese security
forces during a demonstration in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on
Dec. 10. It was the third outbreak of anti-Chinese violence in Lhasa
in the past 14 months.
   China and India are trying to restore friendly ties after a
quarter century of soured relations, which hit bottom during a
21-day border war in 1962.
   The border question was the main topic during talks Monday
between Gandhi and China's Premier Li Peng.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of what India says is part of
its northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh. India claims 14,500 square
miles of land seized by China in 1962.
   Gandhi and Li, however, vowed not to let the border problem
interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties.
   Gandhi is the first Indian leader to visit China since his
grandfather, former Prime Minister Jawalharlal Nehru, came in 1954.
   Accomapnied by his Italian-born wife, Sonia, Gandhi today
traveled about 37 miles northwest of Beijing to the Badaling section
of the Great Wall, the 3,720-mile-long barrier built over a
2,000-year period to keep out invaders.
   The Indian leader also visited the Temple of Heaven, a 15th
century structure where China's emperors once prayed for good
harvests and performed sacrificial rituals.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is scheduled to meet 84-year-old senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang.
   The two sides are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation,
border trade, science and technology and the exchange of consular
offices in Shanghai and Bombay.

   Thailand has announced it will open a
transition camp for Burmese students who had fled the military
crackdown in their country and now want to return home.
   The agreement to open the camp was reached in talks last week
between the Burmese leader, Gen. Saw Maung, and Gen. Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, the Thai army chief who was the first foreign
dignitary to visit Burma since the Sept. 18 coup.
   Chavalit, speaking on army-run Channel 5 television, said the
camp would be opened Wednesday at the airport in the city of Tak,
about 50 miles from the Burmese border. Burma said last month it
would send aircraft to transport the students who want to go home.
   ``The Thai government is worried about hardships on these
students and has been assured by the Burmese government of their
safety when they return,'' he said.
   He said the students will receive medical examinations while they
wait for repatriation at the camp administered by the Thai army and
the Thai and Burmese Red Cross.
   Students had been at the forefront of this year's pro-democracy
demonstrations in Burma, ruled by military autocracies for the past
quarter century. Thousands of the protesters fled the cities after a
bloody crackdown by the government.
   Thai officials said more than 7,000 Burmese students joined
anti-government guerrilla groups based along the Thai border. The
rebels have been waging a four-decade war for greater autonomy.
   Chavalit said about 300 of the students had made their way from
the border to Bangkok.
   On Tuesday, 30 Burmese students met with Chavalit in Bangkok and
asked his help in arranging a meeting between them and Saw Maung to
discuss his request that they return.
   Chavalit's visit to Burma on Wednesday marked a break in the
informal international agreement to refrain from any moves that
might imply recognition of the Saw Maung government.
   Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Prapas Limpabandhu, told
reporters today that he will visit Burma ``to tell them we want to
see Burma develop democracy.''
   No date has been set.
   Asked if his visit meant Thai recognition of the Burmese
government, Prapas said the Thai Embassy remains open, and that
means recognition.

<HEAD>Transit Authority Proposes No-Pockets Approach To Fighting Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City transit officials have come up with a
simple solution they say will make it harder for employees to pocket
bus fares _ eliminate employees' pockets.
   ``Opportunity makes the thief,'' Gordana Swanson, president of
the Southern California Rapid Transit District board, said Monday as
she endorsed a plan to distribute pocketless uniforms to all workers
who handle bus fares.
   Many workers who handle the money already wear such uniforms. For
those who don't, Ms. Swanson suggested sewing shut the pockets on
their clothes until new uniforms can be provided.
   The workers who still have pockets remove fare boxes from buses
with special keys and put the money in carts. The carts are then
delivered to armored trucks, which take the cash to the transit
authority's counting rooms.
   The new uniforms were one of several recommendations Transit
Authority General Manager Alan Pegg made in response to an audit
warning of ``casual pilferage and organized theft'' of fare-box
revenue. Estimates of annual losses range from thousands to millions
of dollars.
   Auditors said most of the losses occurred in the counting rooms,
where they said they saw money lying loose on the floors. In
addition, workers who count fares were allowed to leave the building
without being checked by security guards, auditors said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Says Pirate Radio Ship Needs License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rock 'n' roll pirate radio ship that had
broadcast beyond the 3-mile territorial limit off Long Island, N.Y.,
needs a Federal Communications Commission license to keep operating,
a federal judge has ruled.
   The ruling ends claims by Alan H. Weiner of New York, the ship's
former owner and one of four defendants, that the radio ship Sarah
had a constitutional right to broadcast without an FCC license on
``open and unused frequencies.''
   Jeremiah Gutman, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer and
counsel to Weiner and Radio New York International, argued that his
clients had the ``right to freedom of expression over the public
forum of the airwaves.''
   However, U.S. District Judge John J. McNaught, in a summary
judgment granted the government Dec. 13, rejected the defendants'
contention that the broadcast spectrum is ``a natural phenomenon,
like oceans and lakes and ... is analogous to streets and public
parks,'' where free speech is a right.
   The judge said the defendants ``could not look to the First
Amendment for authority to broadcast on an unoccupied frequency in
violation of both federal and international law. The First Amendment
does not grant anyone the right to broadcast by radio.''
   Weiner has said he launched the pirate station to protest what he
called conformity in New York-area radio programming.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Israel's two main political blocs
agreed to maintain their longstanding refusal to talk to the PLO in
their new coalition government, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said
today.
   The right-wing Likud bloc and the center-left Labor Party were
expected to initial their coalition pact today after negotiators
agree on final details of foreign and economic policy. The formal
signing is expected in a day or two.
   The agreement Monday to form another coalition resolved a
seven-week stalemate after national elections Nov. 1 in which
neither party received a clear mandate. Likud won 40 seats in the
120-seat Parliament and Labor won 39.
   Peres, who spoke to reporters after Labor ministers ratified the
agreement, said the pact reiterates the guidelines of Israel's
outgoing government ``that there will be no negotiations with the
PLO.''
   The ban was maintained despite a U.S. decision last week to open
a ``substantive dialogue'' with the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The decision stunned Israel.
   The agreement also does not require the government to fulfill a
demand by religious parties to pass a law that would narrow the
definition of a Jew to exclude those converted by non-Orthodox
rabbis.
   The ammendment to the so-called Law of Return, which fixes
eligibility for Israeli citizenship, deeplu angered U.S. Jews, most
of whom are non-Orthodox.
   ``The government will work to keep the Jewish people united. This
brings an end to a change in the Law of Return,'' Peres said.
   The new Cabinet, to be headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
Likud, is expected to command a majority of up to 97 seats in
Parliament, or the Knesset, including several smaller religious
parties expected to join.
   It will contain 24 or 25 ministers, 10 each for Likud and Labor
with the remainder going to the smaller parties. Most key posts will
be held by the same officials as in the last government, with
Yitzhak Rabin of Labor remaining defense minister and Ariel Sharon
of Likud industry minister.
   Peres, leader of the Labor Party, will become finance minister.
The party chose the post for Peres so they would have a springboard
for funneling money to the nation's ailing collective farms, or
kibbutzim, many of which are aligned with Labor, and a string of
industries owned by the Histadrut Labor Federation.
   The Hadashot newspaper said the government's new program calls
for a peace initiative ``aspiring for direct negotiations with Arab
states and a delegation of Palestinians made up of leaders from the
(occupied) territories.''
   The program vows to ``act aggressively to restore security in the
territories,'' and says all political peace initiatives would have
to be approved in advance by the Cabinet, the newspaper said.
   Shamir and Peres each needed a crucial vote of approval from
their parties' central committees before the agreement could be
signed and a government installed.
   Likud officials said Shamir faced a stormy reception from his
party's central committee.
   Shamir has already come under criticism from party hardliners
such as Sharon, a former defense minister, who expressed concern
that Labor's conciliatory stance would bring about an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where
Palestinians have been in revolt for a year.
   Sharon told Israel radio today that because Labor favors a
partial withdrawal from the occupied territories, a government with
Labor was ``liable to bring about establishment of a PLO-Palestinian
state and a continued Arab onslaught on the rest of Israel.''
   He blamed ``daily attacks on Jews'' and U.S. contacts with the
PLO for the political deadlock between the two parties, which have
governed jointly since 1984.
   Sharon attacked Shamir's decision to join forces with Labor on
Monday night by saying he thought Likud's Moshe Arens should be
defense minister instead of Labor's Rabin, Israeli news media
reported.
   He reportedly accused Shamir of failing to allow the Likud to
``take responsibility and rule.''
   Shamir reportedly replied by saying, ``if the defense portfolio
were in Likud's hands, we would have serious problems in the army.''
   At least 332 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed in the
Arab revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>Court Orders New Inquest Into IRA Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Ireland's highest court
today ordered a new inquest into the deaths of three unarmed Irish
Republican Army members shot by police six years ago.
   The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled that the three police
officers who fired the shots can be forced to testify at the new
hearing. No date has been set.
   But Sir Brian Hutton, the chief justice, made it clear that the
police officers _ who have been acquitted of murdering one of the
IRA members _ can refuse to testify on grounds of possible
self-incrimination.
   The original inquest was adjourned in late November.
   The three members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
province's police force, were among five police officers involved in
the ambush on IRA members Gervase McKerr, Eugene Toman and Sean
Burns. The three men allegedly failed to stop their car at a police
checkpoint in County Armagh in November 1982.
   Eleanor McKerr, the widow of one of the victims, fought to have
the courts order the police officers to testify and be
cross-examined rather than submit written statements.
   Coroner James Elliott had ruled he had no power to compel the
police officers to appear in person. However, his original inquest
has been scrapped and the jury discharged.
   Inquests also are to be held into the deaths of three other
unarmed Roman Catholics _ two of them guerrillas and the third a
teen-age civilian _ who died in two separate police ambushes in 1982.
   Police said all the deaths occurred in the normal course of
anti-terrorist activity, but subsequent evidence suggested the
killings might have been avoided and that police were operating
under a ``shoot-to-kill'' policy.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is trying to oust Britain from Northern
Ireland and unite the majority Protestant province with the Irish
Republic.

   A convicted murderer was shot to death
today by the father of his victim during an appeal court hearing to
reduce his sentence, police said.
   Ioannis Venierakis, 36, serving a life sentence, was shot with a
pistol by Ioannis Papadosifos, 62, who was arrested by court police,
a police official said.
   ``I did it for the memory and honor of my son,'' Papadosifos was
quoted as saying later at a Piraeus police station.
   Venierakis was convicted of the 1983 slaying of 27-year-old
Manolis Papadosifos. Venierakis had suspected that the victim was
having an affair with his wife, said the police official, who was
unidentified according to Greek practice.
   The father had denied Venierakis' allegation.
   Both men come from the island of Crete. The court hearing was
scheduled to take place there but was moved to Piraeus, a port city
near Athens, for fear that violence would break out, the official
said.
   There are instances in Crete where families seek revenge and
carry on vendettas that last for generations.

<TEXT>
   Palestinian hardliners said today they
will continue the armed struggle against Israel to torpedo Yasser
Arafat's peace efforts and will seek to oust Arafat from the PLO
leadership, a Palestinian source said.
   The senior Palestinian source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Syrian-backed radical factions were meeting in
Damascus to discuss ``practical steps and measures to counter
Arafat's surrenderist moves.''
   The radicals have denounced the PLO chief's explicit recognition
of Israel and renunciation of terrorism. Arafat's statements, made
in Geneva last week, led the United States to open an official
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization for the first
time since the U.S. banned PLO contacts 13 years ago.
   Arafat was in Yugoslavia today as part of his bid to gain
international support for his peace initiative.
   Opposition to Arafat's campaign, which is aimed at securing an
independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, appeared to be gathering momentum among Palestinians who
believe he has made too many concessions.
   The United States has stressed it will break off talks if the PLO
carries out terrorist attacks. While attacks by non-PLO factions may
fall outside that condition, they could seriously undermine Arafat's
initiative.
   The factions meeting in Damascus included the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, led by former Syrian
Army Capt. Ahmed Jibril, the Fatah-Uprising of Col. Saeed Mousa and
the small Saiqa group, the source said.
   He said the radicals had formed a committee to discuss ways of
ousting Arafat and his allies to install a militant leadership
``which will adhere firmly to the PLO charter and sponsor the armed
struggle against Israel as the only way to liberate the occupied
territories.''
   The committee, he claimed, includes some leaders of the yearlong
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza and ``various
Palestinian personalities, most of whom held senior posts in the
PLO.'' He did not identify them further.
   On Monday, a member of the PLO's governing body reflected a
possible serious split in the organization's top ranks by calling
Arafat's recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism
``Arafat's personal opinion.''
   Mustafa Zibri, a member of the PLO executive committee, said the
PLO chairman's statements last week were ``incompatible with the
resolutions of the latest Palestine National Council meeting.''
   The council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, met in Algeria last
month to declare an independent Palestinian state. It indirectly
recognized Israel's existence and condemned terrorism, but did not
go far enough to gain U.S. recognition.
   The PLO is an umbrella organization of eight different
Palestinian guerrilla factions dominated by Arafat's mainstream
Fatah group. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel claims it is
bent on Israel's destruction.
   Zibri's statement could represent serious dissent because of his
seat on the PLO's 15-member executive commitee, which includes
representatives of six Palestinian guerrilla groups as well as
independents. Fatah has three seats.
   Zibri is the sole committee representative of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed Marxist group
headed by George Habash, who told Arafat at the Algiers meeting that
his faction does not believe in moderation.
   It was not immediately known whether Habash endorsed Zibri's
statement, which was signed with Zibri's guerrilla name, Abu Ali
Mustafa. The statement was delivered from Damascus, to The
Associated Press in Nicosia. The office of the Popular Front in
Damascus confirmed the statement.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa,
vowing to halt ethnic violence on this Indian Ocean island, was
elected president with slightly more than half the votes, the
government said today.
   Earlier today, Sinhalese extremists hacked and shot to death nine
supporters of Premadasa's governing United National Party in a town
east of Colombo, police said.
   ``The politics of terror has no place in the temple of
democracy,'' Premadasa said in a televised address immediately after
the announcement. ``I will eradicate fear and suppresion. I will
restore law and order.''
   Premadasa received 50.4 percent of the vote in Monday's election,
edging former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the opposition
Sri Lanka Freedom Party, according to Commissioner of Elections
Chandrananda de Silva.
   Premadasa has vowed to remove controversial Indian peacekeeping
troops when he takes over Sri Lanka's most powerful government post
Jan. 2 for a six-year term.
   Ms. Bandaranaike had no immediate comment on the balloting, and a
man who answered the phone at her home said she was ill. But one of
her close allies said she had described the results as ``unjust''
and would not accept them. The associate spoke on condition of
anonymity and would not elaborate.
   As promised, outgoing President Junius R. Jayewardene today
dissolved Parliament and called new legislative elections for Feb.
15. He ordered an islandwide curfew to take effect after the
official election results were announced.
   ``I particularly wish to ask, to appeal, to those who belong to
the winning side, to treat your opponents who have lost with
friendship, affection and love,'' he said.
   With all 182 polling districts counted, Premadasa had 2,569,199
votes, or 50.4 percent, compared with 2,299,770, or 45 percent for
Mrs. Bandaranaike, the election commissioner said.
   The remaining votes went to a leftist coalition candidate, Ossie
Abeygoonesekera. The turnout was 55 percent, well below the
nationwide rate of 80 percent in the 1982 presidential election as a
campaign of imitidation by extremists apparently kept many people at
home.
   Officials have blamed Sinhalese extremists of the People's
Liberation Front for the recent campaign of terror. The extremists
had threatened to kill anyone who voted on Monday.
   The military reported five Indian troops were killed in an ambush
by Tamil ethnic minority rebels Monday, bringing the reported
election day death toll to at least 20.
   Today's attacks occurred in Bandarawela, about 75 miles east of
Colombo, local authorities said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
They did not elaborate.
   The threats kept thousands from the polls. In the north, where
militants of the Tamil minority are fighting for an independent
state, many voting districts reported less than 10 percent turnout.
   And in the south, where Sinhalese extremists oppose government
concessions to the Tamils, turnout ranged from 20 percent to 70
percent.
   Premadasa was the standard-bearer for the party of Jayewardene,
who was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term.
   Under Jayewardene's rule, Sri Lanka neared the brink of ruin
because of ethnic violence that has killed nearly 10,000 people
since 1983, when Tamils began an uprising against the Sinhalese.
   With the help of neighboring India _ the subcontinent's
superpower and home to 60 million Tamils _ Jayewardene signed a
peace accord in July 1987 aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency.
   The pact guaranteed some autonomy to the Tamils, who make up 18
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people _ and invited India to help
end the uprising by sending troops, which now number about 47,000.
   The People's Liberation Front vehemently opposed the pact and
vowed to kill anyone who supported the government after it was
signed. The front has been blamed for hundreds of slayings since.
   Both Premadasa and Mrs. Bandaranaike, who was prime minister in
1960-66 and 1970-77, opposed the Tamil accord.
   Premadasa has called for the phased or immediate withdrawal of
Indian troops.
   But Indian High Commissioner J.N. Dixit has indicated his country
will not accept unilateral action.
   Premadasa also campaigned as a champion of the poor and has
promised a monthly $75 to the country's most impoverished families.
He did not explain where the money would come from.

<TEXT>
   A witness in the trial of
confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi testified today that a pistol
used in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner may have been smuggled
onto the plane inside a fish.
   Petra Posiege, 31, a West German federal police investigator,
also told the court that information gathered by Greek police
indicated hand grenades on the plane may have been smuggled in with
a bunch of fruit.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the hijacking of
TWA flight 847. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage 17 days
during the ordeal.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot and killed by the
hijackers after the Athens-to-Rome flight was hijacked on June 14,
1985.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has admitted taking part in the
hijacking, but denies killing Stethem. He has testified that his
accomplice, identified in court records as Hassan Ezzeddine, shot
Stethem.
   Ms. Posiege said she traveled to Athens after the hijacking to
ask Greek police about their arrest of another man who officials
said planned to join the two other hijackers but failed to get on
the flight.
   Ms. Posiege said Greek police identified the arrested man as Ali
Atwa, who had been taken into custody ``because he was acting
suspiciously.''
   ``They wouldn't give any other details on why he was arrested,''
she told the court.
   Under questioning, she said, ``Ali Atwa told them (Greek
investigators) the pistol was smuggled aboard the hijacked plane in
a fish, and the grenades were between some fruit,'' said Ms. Posiege.
   However, she said Greek police told her they did not believe
Atwa's story.
   ``They were convinced that their airport security measures were
adequate, and that the weapons were placed on board the airliner in
Cairo, Egypt, from where it had arrived earlier,'' Ms. Posiege said.
   During the hijacking ordeal, the plane was forced to land three
times in Beirut and twice in Algiers.
   Stethem was killed when the plane landed the second time in
Beirut.
   After Stethem was shot, the hijackers forced the airliner to
return to Algiers. Ali Atwa was flown there and released in exchange
for all Greek passengers and the remaining women and children on the
plane, court records indicate.
   Ms. Posiege identifed the Greek officials she talked with only as
the heads of the anti-terror, security, and Interpol offices in
Athens.
   Also today, a written deposition from an American passenger
aboard the hijacked plane was read into the court record.
   Joseph Cucchi's description of the ordeal, including beatings of
passengers and the shooting of Stethem, echoed those of dozens of
other witnesses who have testified earlier at the trial, which began
on July 5 in a high security courtroom in Frankfurt.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger said today the court would honor
a defense request to try to obtain more detailed reports on the
hijacking from international aviation organizations who may have
monitored radio transmissions with the TWA airliner.
   Among those to be contacted were the U.S.-based Federal Aviation

<HEAD>School Disputes Selection Of Band For Bush's Inaugural Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of George Bush's inaugural
parade passed over what was judged one of Maine's best high school
bands in favor of the school that serves Bush's summer home.
   It's ``a rotten, stinking deal,'' said William L. Reid, the head
of the boosters' club for the Mount Blue High School band.
   The 77-member band, located in this western Maine town, submitted
video and audio tapes of its performances to the inaugural committee.
   The committee had said selections would be based on merit,
including past achievements, and the Mount Blue band believed its
victory last month in the annual Maine Band Directors Association
competition would give it the edge.
   But Reid learned Monday that the Mount Blue band was rejected.
Instead, the only Maine band picked to play in the parade was the
one from Kennebunk High School, which serves students from Bush's
home in Kennebunkport.
   Reid and other supporters of the Mount Blue band complained to
members of Maine's congressional delegation that political
considerations outweighed other factors in the band's selection.
   ``People are enraged,'' said Rosemary Poulson, editor of the
Franklin County Journal in Farmington.
   The leader of the Kennebunk band made no apologies.
   ``I can't help it if our band is from Kennebunk,'' Bruce Lewia
said. ``I'm sure there were political connections. That's just the
way the ball bounces.''
   Lewia's band has not competed in the state competition, but he
said it has participated in regional competitions outside Maine.
   ``We're not some scrub band,'' he said. ``We're a good band.''

<HEAD>U.S. Making Diplomatic Efforts To Stop Libyan Chemical Weapons
Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is making diplomatic efforts
to dissuade other nations and private companies from selling Libya
materials needed to start up its huge chemical weapons plant, the
State Department's top counter-terrorism official said today.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday that the Libyan
plant was ``on the verge of full-scale production,'' and L. Paul
Bremer, head of the department's counter-terrorism office, said
official are concerned its products might get into the hands of
terrorist groups around the world.
   Bremer, interviewed today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
said there have been discussions with several countries in what he
described as ``a major diplomatic effort to try to persuade
companies and countries around the world not to sell the kind of
precursors that are necessary for chemical weapons production to
Libya.''
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has denied his country has
developed the capability for chemical warfare.
   Bremer said in an Associated Press interview on Monday that Lybia
has a ``long-standing, close relationship with some of the world's
most murderous terrorist groups'' and has been willing to provide
destructive weapons to those groups.
   He said, however, there was no evidence the north African nation
had distributed any chemical weapons to others.
   U.S. officials previously had acknowledged U.S. concern about a
large chemical facility reportedly based in a mountain chain 35
miles from Libya's Mediterranean coast.
   ``We've been following the developments of this plant now for
some time. It goes back even earlier than the first press reports
about it in the fall,'' said Bremer on ABC.
   ``I think our objective now is to try to see if we can't persuade
other people to stop providing the kind of chemical agents which are
used in this kind of plant. That's the major objective now of our
diplomacy,'' Bremer said.
   Asked whether the United States would use military action to
prevent chemical weapons production in Libya, Bremer said, ``I'm not
going to comment on what kind of military measures might be used.''
   The United States has previously used military action against
Libya, bombing Tripoli in April 1986 in retaliation for the
country's alleged role in terrorist acts.
   Bremer also urged progress toward a worldwide ban on chemical
weapons at an international conference on disarmament scheduled to
reconvene in February.

<HEAD>Report: Press Freedom Under Attack in Democracies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Press freedom came under attack in 1988 from some
of its staunchest defenders _ democratic countries such as the
United States, Britain, India and Australia, the International Press
Institute reported.
   The plight of the media remained bleak under repressive regimes,
but the trend in democrcies was the year's most worrisome
development, the institute said in its annual ``World Press Freedom
Review.''
   ``One of the saddest truths facing the media around the world
today is the growing trend toward government interference in
democratic countries,'' Peter Galliner, the institute's director,
wrote in the report's introduction.
   ``The hopes and encouragement of nations which are on their way
towards more freedom and who rely on an example from countries with
a democratic system, an open society and freedom, must not be
crushed by governments in the free world,'' he said.
   The 32-page report cited ``significant improvements'' in press
freedom in Taiwan and South Korea, and setbacks in Chile, Colombia,
Malaysia and other nations where journalism continues to be a
sometimes dangerous and often difficult profession.
   While the Soviet Union's policy of glasnost has meant
``heartening strides'' toward a more open press, restrictions on the
reporting of subjects such as ethnic violence in Armenia have been a
``disgrace,'' the report said.
   The institute, which has offices in London and Zurich, is an
independent body representing 2,000 publishers and editors in more
than 60 countries. Its report this year detailed developments in 82
countries.
   In 1988, the U.S. administration ``continued its efforts to limit
public access to information held by the American government,'' the
report said.
   It cited as a ``blatant example'' of interference in the media
the U.S. Supreme Court's upholding of the conviction of a former
intelligence analyst for giving satellite photographs of a Soviet
ship to a British magazine. The analyst, Samuel Loring Morison, was
sentenced to two years in prison.
   The report also criticized the new Canada-U.S. Free Trade
Agreement for restricting Canadian journalists who can work in the
United States to those with a university degree and three years'
experience.
   ``Attempts to define qualifications for journalists ... pose a
serious threat,'' it said, noting it was the first time the rule was
``enshrined in an international accord.''
   In Britain, the press scored a victory when Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government lost its court fight to prevent
newspapers from publishing extracts from ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs
of former intelligence agent Peter Wright.
   However, the report criticized Britain's ban on all radio and
television interviews with 11 groups in Northern Ireland, including
the outlawed Irish Republican Army and its political wing, Sinn
Fein. The report called the ban ``the most drastic action taken
against British broadcasters in peacetime.''
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India was forced at the last
minute to withdraw legislation that would have shifted the duty of
proving defamation from plaintiffs to journalists, the report said.
   An Australian court ordered a journalist to reveal his sources,
and South Africa's press had an ``appalling year,'' marked by
three-month publication bans for two newspapers and a one-month ban
on another, it said.
   Elsewhere, ``the media under dictatorships remained all too
predictably under lock and key,'' the report noted.
   One of the worst years ever for the independent press in Chile
was marked by violent assaults on 24 foreign and Chilean
journalists. Five journalists were forced to leave Colombia
following the passage of an anti-terrorist law.
   Jordan and Malaysia cracked down on their press, Singapore
continued to do so and China soured a promising start by reasserting
control and suppressing negative news, the report said.
   However, the South Korean press had a ``watershed year,'' with
many visible and invisible restrictions lifted, and in Taiwan,
economic and political liberalizations were extended to the media,
the report said.

<HEAD>Life Sentence For Woman Involved In Burying Kidnap Victim Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman convicted in the kidnap-murder of
businessman Stephen Small, who suffocated when buried alive, was
sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
   ``I just want to say I am not guilty of those charges, never
was,'' Nancy Rish told Judge John Michela. ``I am very sorry for
what happened, for what I was associated with.''
   The woman cried and hugged her mother after hearing the sentence.
   Small, a member of a prominent media family and great-grandson of
a former Illinois governor, was kidnapped Sept. 2, 1987. His body
was unearthed two days later after his wife received a muffled
telephone call seeking $1 million in ransom.
   Nancy Small was unable to understand the tape of her husband
reading the ransom delivery instructions, and the money never was
paid.
   ``There was not one grain of remorse, not one grain of salt in
the tears of this woman for Stephen Small and his family,''
prosecutor Michael Ficaro told Michela before Ms. Rish was sentenced
Monday. ``The crocodile tears we saw at the trial and those we see
now are for Nancy Rish, not for Stephen Small.''
   Prosecutors said Ms. Rish, 26, joined with her boyfriend, Daniel
Edwards, in the plot. They said Ms. Rish lured Small from his home
with a telephone call so he could be abducted by Edwards.
   Small, 40, was taken to a remote area between Kankakee and the
Indiana line, placed in a homemade wooden box with a breathing tube
and buried. The ventilation system in the box failed and Small
suffocated.
   Edwards was convicted of murder and kidnapping in May and
sentenced to die, but prosecutors said Ms. Rish was not eligible for
the death penalty.
   Before her conviction Nov. 2, Ms. Rish claimed that witnesses
against her had lied, and that she was the victim of mistaken
identity.
   Small's late father was head of Mid-America Media Group, whose
properties included 11 radio stations, and his uncle was head of
Small Newspapers Inc., and editor and publisher of the The Daily
Journal in Kankakee.

<TEXT>
   After the conviction of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. in a
case involving $30 million in defaulted loans, the government is
reviewing whether to proceed with a new trial of the political
maverick on related charges here.
   The move marks a change in course, since federal prosecutors had
vowed to pursue the Boston case regardless of the verdict in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va.
   The complex Boston case, which ended in a mistrial in May,
included allegations of government infiltration of LaRouche groups.
A retrial is scheduled to begin Feb. 22.
   A Virginia jury on Friday found LaRouche and six associates
guilty on all 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy for failing
to repay $30 million in loans from supporters, including one woman
who testified she lost $112,800 in life savings.
   ``The Boston case is different,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
John Markham, who also prosecuted the Virginia case.
   ``It charges different offenses and there is therefore no logical
reason why it should not go forward. But an office-wide decision
will have to be made after all appropriate people are consulted,''
he said Monday.
   The 66-year-old LaRouche faces up to 65 years in prison and $3.25
million in fines; sentencing in Virginia is set for Jan. 27.
   LaRouche, who has run for president four times, is known for his
unconventional views, including supporting an AIDS quarantine and
charging that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the
Queen of England have ties to drug trafficking.
   In Boston, LaRouche, six aides and five political organizations
are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury
investigation into allegations that LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign raised more than $2 million through credit card and loan
fraud.
   LaRouche is charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with
investigators. All the aides and organizations also are charged with
conspiracy, and four of the groups are charged with fraud. Three
more defendants are fugitives.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton called a mistrial after four
jurors complained about the length and conduct of the case, which
was repeatedly delayed by defense motions. The trial began a year
ago.
   The new court date hinges on a federal appeals court ruling on
whether the trial would violate defendants' protection against being
tried twice on the same charges. Attorneys for both sides expect the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to support a new trial.
   Defense lawyers maintain the Virginia convictions make the Boston
case moot and that a retrial would waste government money. They long
have charged that the case is politically motivated, an accusation
prosecutors deny.

   President Reagan has taped a greeting for
broadcast on Soviet television on New Year's Day and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is expected to respond in kind, the
White House said today.
   It would be the third time the two leaders have exchanged
televised New Year's greetings.
   They began the practice in 1986 after their first summit meeting
in Geneva.
   In 1987, the Soviets declined to take part in such an exchange,
saying U.S.-Soviet relations were not good enough to justify it.
Reagan taped a radio message that was broadcast over the Voice of
America, but was jammed in the Soviet Union.
   The exchange was resumed in 1988.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president
videotaped his message last week. He said the brief message
``doesn't deal with policy issues.''
   He said details are now being worked out with the Soviets and he
anticipated that U.S. television networks would be receiving a
Gorbachev tape for their consideration.

<HEAD>U.N. Conference Adopts Convention Against Illicit Drug Trafficking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. conference today an adopted an
international convention against illicit drug trafficking and drug
abuse that it hopes will deal an efficient blow to those who sell
and use drugs.
   ``It's significant because it represents a commitment by over a
hundred other nations to cooperate in fighting the problems of drug
trafficking and drug abuse,'' U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh said at a news conference.
   ``It's apparent that no one nation alone or within its own
borders can deal with the multinational operations of the drug
cartels,'' Thornburgh said.
   The convention for the first time gives all signatory countries
the right of extradition of suspected drug traffickers and the right
to confiscate all their assets.
   The document, first conceived four years ago, was signed by 43
countries, including the United States, at the close of the
monthlong U.N. conference.
   Sixty-three other nations participating in the closed-door
gathering adopted the convention by consensus, according to Axel
Wuestenhage of the U.N. Information office.
   It may take several years for the new convention to become
legally binding. To have legal force, it must be ratified by
parliaments or other national bodies in the signatory countries,
then given to the U.N. secretary-general for notification.
   Many conference delegates were optimistic.
   Asked how the new convention matched recent anti-drug legislation
in the United States, Thornburgh said, ``It's a very good fit.'
   The provisions on money laundering, confiscation of drug dealers'
assets and cooperation in pursuing the traffickers are similar to
U.S. legislation signed last month, Thornburgh said.
   The United States would need only ``a minor adjustment'' to
comply with Article 3 of the Convention, he added. That article
deals with the identification, tracing, freezing and forfeiture of
proceeds derived from drug trafficking.
   The article is seen as a major way to toughen two earlier
international accords by cracking down on modern drug traffickers
whose networks straddle the world and involve billions of dollars.
   The new document, known formally as the Convention Against
Illicit Trafic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,
complements the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs signed by 121
contries and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances so far
ratified by 88 countries.
   Besides providing for asset forfeiture and extradition, the new
document foresees mutual legal assistance and cooperation in
training police and customs officers fighting drugs.
   It also stipulates how to monitor substances frequently used in
the illicit manufacture of drugs, to eradicate illicit plant
cultivation and suppress traffic by sea, in free-trade zones and
free ports.
   Thornburgh said the United States would have preferred stronger
language on extradition, with those engaged in crimes linked to drug
trafficking eligible for extradition ``irrespective of their
nationality whenever they may be found.''
   A special international commission will be charged with
monitoring implementation, Thornburgh said.
   Asked about the cooperation of Switzerland, with its strict laws
on banking secrecy, Thornburgh said Washington had experience with
Switzerland which proved ``very positive ... with regard to waiving
bank secrecy laws when criminal conduct is involved.''

<HEAD>OMB Trying To Stop Safety Standards Duplication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Management and Budget is seeking
to prevent two federal agencies from duplicating each other's work
in setting safety standards for cleanup of hazardous materials, the
White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a meeting is
scheduled on the issue this week and a decision ``should be
forthcoming fairly soo.''
   Fitzwater said the problem of duplication arose as OMB considered
proposed regulations by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration governing safety of state and local emergency workers
involved in cleanup operations.
   A similar standard is being developed by the Environmental
Protection Agency to cover state and local goverment workers who are
not under the jurisdication of OSHA. Fitzwater said this rule is not
expected to be ready for about 90 days.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said in a letter to OMB on Monday
that he had ``grave concerns'' about reports that the budget agency
was intervening in the matter and that ``excluding state and local
employees from the final standard would deny coverage to the very
people Congress intended to protect.''
   ``The OSHA regulation is before OMB,'' said Fitzwater. ``It is
going through normal processing. We don't feel there is any abnormal
delay. There is no real opposition to the regulations.''
   ``There is a meeting scheduled for the next few days to consider
the two regulations and try to eliminate duplication wherever
possible,'' he said. ``It should be forthcoming fairly soon.''

<TEXT>
   A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in
the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south
this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to
reunite it with its brethren.
   The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in
Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the
government do something to save it.
   On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the
animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to
save it.
   ``It's only done in extreme circumstances when the welfare of the
animal is believed to be in danger,'' said Bob Stone, special agent
with the service in Newport News.
   Kathy Read, a diving instructor at the bay, said Rascal has
slowed down and become thinner. ``That's probably due to the food
source probably drying up out there,'' she said.
   Divers hope to go into the bay Wednesday, trap the aquatic mammal
and then deliver him for a flight to warmer waters off the Carolinas
or Georgia.
   Earlier this fall, the plight of three whales icebound off Alaska
attracted worldwide attention. One of the whales died, but the other
two made it to open water after a Soviet icebreaker carved a path
for them.
   Rascal's rescue is to be supervised by Robert Schoelkopf,
director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, N.J.,
because he has captured dolphins before, Stone said.
   The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point had
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia. Bob Byrne, associate
director for research at the institute, said today that it will work
with Schoelkopf on the rescue effort.
   Schoelkopf agreed that a rescue is risky.
   ``You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if
nothing's done,'' he said. ``That animal would die in the area if we
didn't do anything.''
   The dolphin is the second to become stranded in the bay in three
years. Schoelkopf oversaw that rescue three years ago and helped
save dolphins off the North Carolina coast several years ago. An
attempted rescue of a dolphin in Delaware a few years ago failed
when the animal died of a heart attack, he said.
   Rascal may fare better, he said, because apparently it is young.
   Residents have said the animal may not have joined other dolphins
in migrating south because it was frightened of bridge construction
in a narrow channel that links the bay and open water.

<TEXT>
   A jury today deliberated for the second
day charges against three polygamist clan members in the slaying of
a law-enforcement officer, who was killed after a 13-day siege at
the clan's rural compound.
   The second-degree murder case went to the jury Monday night after
more than six hours of instructions and closing arguments and nine
days of testimony. Jurors deliberated three hours, then were sent
home for the night.
   In closing arguments, prosecutor Creighton Horton said clan
patriarch Addam Swapp, 27, his brother Jonathan Swapp, 21, and
brother-in-law John Timothy Singer, 22, deliberately chose a course
of confrontation that led to bloodshed.
   The three are charged in the Jan. 28 death of Utah Corrections
Lt. Fred House. House was killed and Addam Swapp seriously wounded
when a shootout ended the standoff at the clan's Marion farm that
began Jan. 16, when Addam Swapp bombed a Mormon chapel.
   Under Utah law, the maximum penalty for second-degree murder is
life in prison.
   The three defendants and Vickie Singer, wife of the late clan
patriarch John Singer, who was killed by authorities in 1979, have
been sentenced to prison terms for federal violations in the bombing
and standoff. Vickie Singer is the mother of Addam Swapp's two wives.
   Addam Swapp was sentenced to 15 years, John Timothy Singer and
Jonathan Swapp to 10 years and Vickie Singer to five years.
   Horton told jurors that Addam Swapp ``basically declared war on
the church, state and nation'' when he bombed the chapel. Swapp
contended he was divinely inspired to commit the act on the ninth
anniversary of John Singer's death, but Horton dismissed the clan
leader's claims.
   ``God didn't place those weapons in their hands,'' Horton said.
   Addam Swapp's co-counsel, John Bucher, countered that just
because clan members were well-armed did not mean they intended to
use their weapons.
   Bucher told jurors Horton was trying to ``divert your attention
from the real issue _ it's about what (Addam Swapp) did with the
guns. He didn't use them offensively.''
   Singer has acknowleged firing the fatal bullet from his bedroom
window, but maintained he was aiming at police dogs.
   Attorney Fred Metos, representing Singer, called House's death a
``tragic accident'' born of his client's panicked attempt to protect
the Swapp brothers from the dogs. Metos urged the jury to find
Singer guilty of the lesser charge of negligent homicide.
   Jonathan Swapp's attorney, Earl Spafford, said his client only
fired his rifle to try to keep an FBI team from shooting his wounded
brother again.
   But prosecutor Dave Schwendiman said Singer and the Swapp
brothers had willfully and knowingly prolonged the confrontation and
could have accepted a peaceful compromise at any time during the
siege.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross said
today it was suspending its operations in Lebanon after receiving
new threats against the lives of its staffers.
   The decision came four days after the release of Peter Winkler,
the chief Red Cross delegate in south Lebanon who was held hostage
for a month.
   A brief news release said the committee made its decision after
hearing Monday of ``serious threats against its delegates on mission
in Lebanon, placing their lives in acute danger.'' It said the
relief operations would be resumed as soon as the threats are
``clearly and unequivocally withdrawn.''
   The Red Cross now has a staff of 17 in Lebanon. Ten others were
withdrawn after Winkler was kidnapped Nov. 16.
   A Red Cross spokesman, Carlos Bauverd, declined to elaborate on
the nature of the threats or say what groups were believed behind
them. He also would not say how the committee learned of the threats.
   There was also no word on when the staffers would be pulled out
of Lebanon.
   Winkler was taken while working at a refugee camp in the southern
port of Sidon. Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber said that in
indirect contacts, the kidnappers identified themselves as members
of a dissident Palestinian group called ``Organization of Socialist
Revolution.''
   Felber said the kidnappers were demanding a lenient sentence for
a Lebanese Shiite hijacker, Hussein Hariri, who is to go on trial
before the Swiss Supreme Court Feb. 20.
   Hariri hijacked an Air Afrique jetliner July 14, 1987 and killed
a French passenger before he was subdued during a stop at Geneva
airport.
   Fifteen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing
and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Communist Party Meeting to Debate Proposed Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski today
called on the Communist Party to reinvigorate itself and be open to
unconventional compromises with the opposition.
   In a speech opening two days of Central Committee debate on the
party's role, Jaruzelski urged top-level personnel changes and said
the party is determined to remove ``all remnants of Stalinism'' and
embrace ``everything that is consistent with the spirit and
realities of the time.''
   ``We have to remove this damned wall that separates the party
from the young generation,'' he said, speaking unusually bluntly for
a party leader.
   However, he also said the communist Polish United Workers Party
``is and will remain the key political force of socialist Poland.''
   In his speech, Jaruzelski appeared to confirm that changes in the
party leadership were in store. Diplomatic and party sources had
said the meeting might result in the replacement of some older
Politburo members with younger, vigorous party activists.
   ``Serious personnel reconstruction of the party leadership'' is
needed for the ``great work ahead of us,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``The party functioning in a new, effective way will undoubtedly
be a more dynamic promoter of ... national agreement. There are no
taboo subjects. We are open for brave searchings and unconventional,
compromise solutions.''
   Earlier, government spokesman Jerzy Urban had said the plenum of
the 230-member Central Committee was to give ``important impulses in
favor of reconciliation'' and help end the deadlock over launching
formal talks with the opposition.
   Plans to hold the talks stalled after Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa demanded that the government clearly signal its willingness
to legalize the trade union federation banned in 1982, a year after
authorities imposed martial law.
   Urban told reporters today that ``prospects of the (talks) are
not bad, since we are noting an improvement in the internal
climate.''
   On Sunday, Walesa formally organized a 128-member citizens
committee, whose purpose is to act as a united voice for opposition
views on Poland's social and political problems.
   The Central Committee meeting brings together top party leaders
to debate proposed reforms contained in the 30-page document
prepared by the Politburo.
   ``We are ready to develop dialogue and look for new forms of
agreement and cooperation with the opposition,'' the document says,
adding the party can cooperate with any opposition group that
``respects the country's constitution and considers its supreme
values the good of the nation and state.''
   In a negative reference to Solidarity, the document says:
   ``We will always oppose attempts to use the trade union movement
for political manipulations and to transform plants into
battlegrounds.''
   It appears to rule out the existence of new political parties or
legalizing Solidarity, but it takes a generally conciliatory stance
toward the opposition.
   The document endorses public ownership of much of the economy,
maintaining Poland's alliances within the Soviet bloc and preserving
the Communist Party's ``leading role.''

<HEAD>Former Klan Leader Pleads Guilty In Clash With Black Marchers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Ku Klux Klan leader pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor conspiracy charge stemming from a 1979
gunfight and brawl between Klansmen and black marchers.
   Terry Joe Tucker, who was ``exalted cyclops'' of the Cullman
Klavern in 1979, admitted conspiring with other Klansmen to disrupt
the march in Decatur by blacks, who were protesting the arrest of a
black man in the rapes of three white women.
   Tucker entered his guilty plea Monday in federal court in
Birmingham. Prosecutors have not recommended a sentence; U.S.
District Judge James H. Hancock delayed sentencing until at least
late January.
   Tucker faces up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   Tucker is the third former Klansman to plead guilty in the case.
A federal jury convicted a fourth man; five others are scheduled to
stand trial Jan. 9 in Birmingham.
   The clash came during one of several protests blacks staged after
the arrest of Tommy Lee Hines, who was charged with raping the three
white women in 1978. One march ended in a gunfight and brawl with
Klansmen in downtown Decatur in which several marchers and policemen
were injured.
   Hines was convicted of one of the rape counts and sent to prison.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals later ruled that he was
mentally incompetent, and he was moved to a mental hospital.
   Tommy Spina, an attorney for Tucker, said the former Klansman
pleaded guilty in part because Hancock ruled last month that the
conspiracy charge was a misdemeanor rather than a felony.
   Also, the U.S. Supreme Court refused last week to review several
legal challenges to court rulings the Klan defendants had pursued,
clearing the way for the January trial, Spina said.

   A man dressed in a Santa Claus suit
and brandishing a revolver robbed an armored car of $695,000 today,
then fled with an accomplice in a Volkswagen, police said.
   The robber took two sacks of cash from a Dunbar Armored Security
Inc. guard as the guard and his partner picked up the money from a
United Bank branch at a shopping plaza, said Detective Capt. Russell
Hughes. One guard was inside the bank when the robbery occurred.
   ``I was just shocked that anyone would do such a thing,'' said
Enis E. Barressi, a part-time teller at the bank.
   The disguised robber hopped into a brown Volkswagen Jetta driven
by the second man and escaped on a nearby highway, Hughes said. No
shots were fired.
   The robbery occurred shortly before 9:30 a.m.
   A witness to the robbery followed the suspects' car for about a
mile and provided police with descriptions of the robbers, said Lt.
Anthony Duffy.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Dunbar Armored Security in
New Britain acknowledged that it was a Dunbar car that was robbed.
``We are not commenting at this time,'' she said.
   An employee at the United Bank, who wouldn't give her name, said,
``I cannot reveal anything.''

   The federal jury deliberating charges against
former Miss America Bess Myerson asked today to rehear some of the
testimony from the prosecution's star witness.
   Miss Myerson and two others are charged with a divorce-fixing
conspiracy. After 12 weeks of testimony, the jury began deliberating
Monday and resumed today.
   In late morning the panel asked to re-hear testimony by Sukhreet
Gabel as well as the judge's instructions about direct and
circumstantial evidence.
   Miss Myerson, who was Miss America in 1945; her lover, one-time
city contractor Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43; and former state Supreme
Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 76, are charged with plotting to cut
Capasso's temporary support payments to his estranged wife.
   All three are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and aiding the
violation of state bribery laws.
   ``The gist of conspiracy is agreement,'' U.S. District Judge John
F. Keenan explained to jurors Monday during nearly three hours of
instructions.
   It wasn't necessary to find any illegal activity ``actually had
been carried out'' for a conspiracy conviction, he said, adding that
they simply ``must find there was a meeting of the minds of at least
two of the defendants.''
   Prosecutors contended that Miss Myerson, 64, the city's former
cultural affairs commissioner, bribed Mrs. Gabel by giving a
$19,000-a-year city job to the judge's emotionally troubled and
chronically unemployed daughter, Sukhreet, 39.
   Miss Myerson also faces an obstruction of justice count for an
alleged attempt to influence the grand jury testimony of Ms. Gabel.
   The key witness on that count was Ms. Gabel, who conceded in her
testimony that her version of the facts had changed in the past and
might change again. She also said that electroshock treatment she
underwent for clinical depression left her memory, at times, ``like
Swiss cheese.''
   None of the defendants testified in their own behalf and Keenan
told jurors it would be ``unfair, improper and indeed un-American''
to hold that against them.
   The prosecution's case consisted mainly of circumstantial
evidence because there were no witnesses to the alleged bribe
scheme. There were, however, two undisputed, facts: Sukhreet Gabel
was hired as Miss Myerson's personal assistant in late August 1983,
and the judge slashed Capasso's interim support payments from $1,850
a week to $850 a week on Sept. 14, 1983.
   The defense contended that Ms. Gabel's hiring may have been
unwise but was not illegal. The defense also offered legal and
financial explanations for the lowering of Capasso's support
payments.
   Miss Myerson faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and $513,000
in fines if convicted on all counts. Her two co-defendants face up
to 25 years and $263,000 in fines.
   Capasso, once a multimillionaire city sewage contractor, is
serving a three-year prison term for income tax evasion.

<HEAD>Governing Party Names Garcia Rival to Key Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Aprista Party today named
President Alan Garcia's chief rival to its top administrative post,
effectively giving the rival control over the party.
   Former Prime Minister Luis Alva Castro was elected
secretary-general of the center-left party by a majority of
delegates at its 16th National Congress, the party said in a
statement.
   On Saturday, Garcia offered his resignation as party president
after he recieved a bitter reception at the convention. Over the
weekend, party leaders indicated they would reject the offer. But no
rejection has been issued, and it appeared today that the post of
party president would go vacant.
   Today's vote gives Alva Castro, who is also the nation's current
second vice president, control of the governing party.
   Analysts said Alva Castro will likely use the power provided by
his new post to force Garcia to form a new Cabinet composed of
mainstream party members.
   Garcia has been Peru's president since July 1985. His resignation
from the party role did not affect his position as head of the
country, but indicated a serious eroding of his supoport.
   His party opponents frequently accused him of ignoring the wishes
of large sectors of the party in running the country, and his
reputation has plummeted in the face of the worst financial crisis
to hit Peru this century.
   Alva Castro served as prime minister and finance minister during
the first two years of Garcia's five-year term but resigned in a
power struggle stemming over differences with Garcia on economic
policy, analysts say.
   Alva Castro defeated Luis Negreiros, incumbent secretary general
and Garcia ally, for the post in voting that concluded around dawn
today.
   Since resigning from the Cabinet, Alva Castro has been
campaigning for secretary-general, considered a springboard to the
party candidacy for the nation's presidency.

   A record 6.83 million Japanese traveled abroad in
1987, taking advantage of the yen's continued strengthening against
the U.S. dollar, the government said Tuesday.
   The number was up 23.8 percent from the previous record of 5.52
million in 1986, according to an annual report.
   ``We believe we'll be able to see 10 million people (a year)
going abroad within five years,'' said Yasushi Babasaki of the
Transport Ministry's Research and Planning Division.
   In 1987, the Japanese government launched a program to double the
number of Japanese travelers abroad in a five-year period to help
give this nation of 120 million a more international outlook.
   The number of foreign visitors to Japan last year rose 4.5
percent to 2.16 million, but still was below the 1985 figure of 2.33
million visitors, the paper said.
   The yen's value against the dollar has nearly doubled since
September 1985, making foreign visits cheaper for Japanese and
visits to Japan more expensive for foreigners.

   Sixteen people were killed and 11

highway patrol said today.
   In a news release, the patrol said the bus had stalled and the
driver was pouring gasoline into the carburetor when the gasoline
exploded.
   Earlier, the patrol had reported 22 deaths and 12 injuries from
the accident. There was no explanation for the revision.
   The gasoline exploded inside the bus near the front door,
blocking the passengers' escape, the patrol said.
   The bus driver was the only person to escape uninjured, the
patrol said.
   The accident occurred Monday night near the town of Socha, about
140 miles northeast of Bogota.

   An English professor at Darthmouth College
who is also a syndicated newspaper columnist testified today that
the administration at the Ivy League school engaged in a pattern of
trying to repress a conservative off-campus student newspaper.
   Professor Jeffrey Hart, whose son was among the newspaper's
founders in 1980, testified that the Dartmouth establishment was
antagonized by the Review's espousal of a return to a core
curriculum based on the great works of Western civilization.
   ``The counter-culture and New Left people of the 60s and 70s ...
are now in positions of power'' and are shifting emphasis at
Dartmouth and other schools away from the great works in favor of
such courses as women's, black and native American studies, he said.
   The new campus leaders, Hart said, ``select particular groups as
oppressed and lead them toward liberation'' through a
``grievance-generating mechanism.''
   Earlier, a Dartmouth lawyer rejected charges that the college
tried to stifle the Dartmouth Review, and alleged that two former
editors who were suspended deliberately provoked a professor in a
grab for headlines.
   ``What you wanted to do is provoke Professor (William) Cole so
you would get something newsworthy, right?'' lawyer Jack Middleton
asked former Dartmouth Review editor Christopher Baldwin on Monday
at the Superior Court hearing.
   Baldwin denied the charge and accused Dartmouth of denying him
and colleague John Sutter a fair disciplinary hearing and unduly
punishing them over a classroom encounter with Cole in February.
   Baldwin, 21, of Hinsdale, Ill., and Sutter, 22, of St. Louis,
seek reinstatement before their suspensions expire in September
1989. Their cause has drawn support from several prominent
conservatives, including William F. Buckley Jr.
   But Judge Bruce Mohl rebuffed attempts by the students' lawyers
to argue that the sanctions will chill free speech on campuses
nationwide.
   ``I do not believe that the testimony along those lines is
relevant'' to the reinstatement request, Mohl said.
   Baldwin, Sutter and a third student, who are white, were
suspended in March for the encounter with Cole, who is black. The
confrontation came after the paper called one of Cole's courses
``one of Dartmouth's most academically deficient'' and denounced him
for ``racist rantings.''
   The students denied racist intent, but the incident sparked
renewed racial unrest at the Hanover campus. The third student's
suspension has ended; a fourth Review staffer involved in the
confrontation served probation.
   The three students and the review also have filed a federal civil
rights lawsuit against Dartmouth alleging they were targeted for
their outspoken conservative views, such as opposing affirmative
action and women's studies courses at the school. Sens. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., and Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., as well as Buckley,
have supported the students.
   The staffers of the off-campus paper allege that a Dartmouth
disciplinary panel was packed with administrators, teachers and
students who disliked the Review and were mindful of college
President James Freedman's public denunciations of the publication's
actions. Baldwin also charged that he and his colleagues were denied
due process.
   ``These students were disciplined and the extent of the
discipline was because of their exercise or attempt to exercise
freedom of expression ... and the newspaper is suffering as a
result,'' Review lawyer Arthur Ruegger argued.
   But Middleton defended the disciplinary hearing process and said
``there has been no effort whatsoever by Dartmouth College to stifle
the Dartmouth Review.''
   The lawyer added that Freedman _ who, like Cole, is expected to
testify in the hearing later this week _ ``has scrupulously
acknowledged the right of the Dartmouth Review to express its
views.''
   Middleton urged the court to respect the private school's
internal disciplinary authority. He also defended the severity of
the punishment as befitting an ``incursion'' into the classroom that
he said could be the most severe case of such misconduct ever at
Dartmouth.
   Hart also dismissed charges that the Review's treatment of Cole
was racist.
   Cole listened quietly in the courtroom gallery.
   Review staffers said they tried to obtain comment from Cole by
telephone on the critical article, but he declined, calling them
racist. The staffers said that on advice of the paper's lawyer, they
then went to Cole's classroom to give him a written statement
offering him a chance to respond.
   The students said Cole cursed and threatened them. Myerson said
Cole should have been punished, not the students.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese and U.S. filmmakers will try to show that
China's first emperor can be just as big a movie star as its last.
   China International Television Corp., a division of the state-run
China Central Television, and Lumina Productions of Los Angeles on
Tuesday signed an agreement on production of ``China the First
Emperor,'' a feature-length film of the man who united China more
than 2,000 years ago.
   ``It will be a gigantic project,'' said Lumina Vice Chairman
Sonny Luu. The film will cost between $20 million and $30 million,
and will include a cast of 30,000 to 50,000 extras, including two
divisions of the People's Liberation Army, he said.
   Filming is to begin next fall, with a release date of late 1990,
Luu said. ``Perhaps we'll be up for an Oscar in 1990,'' he said.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' the Bernardo Bertolucci-directed film of
the life of Henry Pu Yi, the child emperor when the Qing Dynasty
crumbled in 1911, won nine Oscars and was one of the most celebrated
films about China ever made.
   Luu said Lumina, an independent company making its first major
production, began working on the project four years ago, and was not
influenced by the success of the Bertolucci film.
   The U.S. side will put up 90 percent of the investment and the
Chinese partner will put up 10 percent, he said. China will receive
10 percent of profits and all earnings from the market in China.
   Richard Attenborough, director of ``Gandhi,'' has been approached
about directing the film, and the main actors will be Americans of
Oriental descent, Luu said.
   Ruan Ruolin, vice minister of the Ministry of Radio,
Broadcasting, Movie and Television, said Emperor Chin _ also known
as Qin Shi Huang _ ``was a great man in Chinese history. However, he
made many mistakes also, and making a proper assessment of this
historic figure on the screen is a very difficult but interesting
project.''
   Emperor Chin unified the country in 221 B.C., and is known for
standardizing writing and weights, starting construction of the
Great Wall to keep out northern invaders, and having the famed
terracotta warriors built near his tomb in the ancient capital of
Xian.
   He also has been criticized for brutal oppression of his subjects
that led to a peasant uprising in 209 B.C., a year after his death.
   ``He is comparable to George Washington or Alexander the Great in
the West,'' said Nick Lecong, president of Lumina. ``This film will
allow the outside world to see how China was formed.''
   Lecong, a Vietnamese-American who emigrated to the United States
in 1968, heads a food supply company in Los Angeles. Luu, also a
Vietnamese-American, arrived in the United States as a refugee in
1975.

according to hospital spokeswoman Tonya Swanson.
   It had been three years since Robinson worked regularly in
television.
   He earned his spot in broadcasting history in 1978 when he began
co-anchoring the ABC Evening News from Chicago with Peter Jennings
in London and Frank Reynolds in Washington.
   In 1969, he had become the first black to anchor newscasts on a
major Washington station. He appeared on the 6 and 11 p.m. news on
WTOP, now WUSA, with co-anchor Gordon Peterson.
   ``He had great presence on the air,'' said James Snyder, vice
president for news for Post Newsweek Stations, who worked with
Robinson at WTOP. ``He was a very meticulous dresser. He was a very
proud man. He was very meticulous about his on-air performance. He
rarely made a mistake. He was very conscious that he was a role
model.''
   But Snyder and others said Robinson was haunted by private
demons. Friends said he labored under enormous pressure to be a role
model for others of his race.
   He was never as successful at the network as he was in local
television, where WTOP's news earned top ratings.
   Snyder said Robinson experienced extreme mood swings. Two
marriages failed.
   Over the past couple of years, Robinson had been ill, wasting
away and reduced to walking with a cane, while refusing to reveal
what his illness was.
   Survivors included four children, Mark, Maureen, Michael and
Malik.

<HEAD>Report Points To Sewers And Landfills As Source Of Beach Waste</HEAD>

   The washed-up medical waste and other debris
that spoiled New York City-area beaches last summer came from
several sources, including a landfill, sewer overflows, garbage
transfer stations and storm water outlets, state officials say.
   ``We have not found any evidence of a single culprit discharging
the medical waste,'' Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas
Jorling said as he released a report on an investigation into the
waste.
   Several of the state's most popular beaches had to be closed
temporarily during the area's hottest summer in decades when debris
_ including syringes and blood vials _ came ashore. Waste washups
also resulted in beach closings in other Eastern states, including
New Jersey and Rhode Island, as well as along Lake Erie and Lake
Michigan.
   The report blamed the washups primarily on inadequate garbage
handling in New York City and on the weather.
   Medical waste accounted for only 1 percent to 10 percent of the
washed up debris. Jorling said Monday the highly publicized beach
closings pointed to the need for more stringent controls on all
garbage, including medical waste.
   The report highlights the need for change in New York City's
sewage and landfill systems, said a spokesman for a national
environmental organization.
   ``While an army of state, federal and local people have been
looking for midnight dumpers, the real villain here may actually be
the city sewer system and the city's landfills,'' said Mark Izeman
of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   While much of the beach waste probably was disposed of legally,
environmental officials still believe the vials of blood that washed
ashore could have been the result of illegal dumping, said Jorling.
The vials, at least one of which contained blood contaminated by the
AIDS virus, are the subject of a criminal investigation, he said.
   The state and New York City have strengthened garbage policies
and improved facilities since the beach closings, said Jorling.

   Members of a pro-military student group,
dressed as Santa and Mrs. Claus and two elves, appeared at a White
House gate Tuesday to hand out candy canes along with letters asking
President Reagan to pardon former national security aide Oliver
North.
   The foursome also visited the offices of several news
organizations and North's attorneys, and delivered a stocking full
of coal to independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who is prosecuting
North for his role in the Iran-contra affair.
   Their petition from ``Santa'' said that ``Only you, Mr.
President, can give Ollie North the gift that I, and tens of
millions of Americans, would like to see him have for Christmas this
year _ a full and unconditional pardon.''
   Reagan, however, has said he does not believe it would be fair to
North to pardon him before he has a chance to vindicate himself in
court. North's trial is likely to begin in late January, after
Reagan has left office.
   The costumed students were members of the Student Defense
Alliance, a campus wing of the Center For Peace and Freedom, which
supports President Reagan's strategic defense initiative and other
Pentagon programs.

<HEAD>Prosecution Rests Its Case in Steinberg Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution in the trial of a former lawyer
accused of fatally beating his 6-year-old adopted daughter rested
its case today after an expert on child abuse testified that Lisa
Steinberg was a battered child.
   Besides the medical expert, the prosecution called a neighbor who
told jurors she heard sounds of violence coming from the Steinberg
apartment the night before the child was found dead.
   The defense was to begin its case later today in the 9-week-old
trial.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with murder in the
November 1987 death of Lisa, who he illegally obtained at birth from
an unwed teen-ager and raised as his own.
   Lisa was removed unconscious from Steinberg's apartment the
morning of Nov. 2, and taken to St. Vincent's Hospital, where she
died of a head injury three days later.
   Steinberg denies that he hit the child, but his longtime
companion, Hedda Nussbaum, has testified that he told her the night
the child was injured that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she didn't
want to get up.''
   Steinberg contends Lisa died after choking on vegetables and her
own vomit.
   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many
New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   Dr. Margaret McHugh testified today that Lisa was a battered
child based on medical, pediatric and autopsy reports and color
photographs taken at the hospital and at Steinberg's Greenwich
Village apartment.
   She said that multiple bruises, the child's poor hygiene and the
brain hemorrhage Lisa suffered were consistent with child abuse.
   Neighbor Joan Bonano testified Monday that she heard slaps and
screams from the apartment before the night Steinberg is accused of
beating Lisa to death.
   Ms. Bonano said she called police three or four times after
hearing the sounds from the Steinberg apartment, two floors above
her.
   Ms. Bonano also testified that Ms. Nussbaum appeared increasingly
``battered'' in the years before the child died, and that by
November 1987, Ms. Nussbaum was limping.

   Looking the part, not being a gifted
performer, is what pays off in Hollywood, according to an article in
TV Guide. And it doesn't hurt if you're as good-looking as Elizabeth
McGovern or Kelly McGillis.
   Hollywood, actors learn, ``isn't very interested in the actor's
craft,'' concludes staff writer Susan Littwin. Casting director
Michael Greer tells her, for example, ``We look for naturalness, for
someone who is the part.''
   Joseph Brutsman, 28, was named best comic actor in his class when
he graduated from the renowned Juilliard School in 1983. He has
appeared in two made-for-TV movies, ``Do You Remember Love'' and
``The Atlanta Child Murders,'' and has had recurring roles in
``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'' and ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story.''
   But two of his classmates, McGovern and McGillis, get better
roles and bigger paychecks.
   ``We didn't realize that they were incredible-looking women,'' he
said in the article. ``We were so close, we didn't think they were
working because of their looks.''

   After working alongside apes in ``Gorillas in the
Mist,'' actress Sigourney Weaver is playing a shark in her newest
film, ``Working Girl.''
   Not a real shark, mind you _ a Wall Street shark.
   Investment banker Katherine Parker is a woman ``who sees the
world as her oyster, who's been brought up in the most privileged
circumstances to believe that everything would come her way,'' Ms.
Weaver told Savvy Woman magazine.
   In other words, a woman not unlike herself. Ms. Weaver, whose
mother was a distinguished actress and whose father was president of
NBC, said she was brought up to believe that ``with me, all things
were possible.''
   In researching her role, Ms. Weaver said she did find that Wall
Street was more competitive than Hollywood, and her character
reflects that atmosphere.
   ``If feminists are going to object to me playing a ruthless woman
sympathetically, all I can say is I don't care,'' she said. ``I'm
interested in human nature, not whitewashed human nature, and there
are women like Katherine out there.''
   Also starring are Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford.

   Carly Simon says rumors that she was heiress to
the Simon & Schuster megabuck publishing firm were started early on
in her singing career by a misinformed manager.
   In an interview appearing in the January issue of FAME magazine,
Simon says she was briefly signed to manager Albert Grossman when
she was first starting out.
   ``He said, `If you were hungry, you'd be better. And you're not
hungry.' Of course, he thought I was the Simon & Schuster heiress,''
Simon tells the magazine. ``And I wasn't.''
   Simon's father, Richard, was the co-founder of Simon & Schuster
but he sold the small, albeit successful, company to another group
that turned it into the giant publishing house known today.
   The singer and her siblings got less than $50,000 each when their
father died in 1960, when Simon was 15.
   Simon has gained a fat bank account from her own success,
including ``You're So Vain,'' ``That's the Way I Always Heard it
Should Be,'' ``Anticipation,'' ``Vengeance'' and her new platinum
album, ``Coming Around Again.''

them, her daughter says.
   ``So there's NATO, Washington, Warsaw among the selection of
coats and suits hanging in her wardrobe,'' Carol Thatcher wrote in

   Ms. Thatcher also said her mother favors fake jewelry and is
rarely seen without pearls or brooches.
   ``Fashion-watchers the world over agree she looks better now than
she ever has,'' Ms. Thatcher wrote.
   ``Since her Moscow trip in 1987, her look has changed
dramatically. Out went the flowery prints and pussycat bows _ in
their place were brighter jewel colors and simple tailored lines,
which add up to an altogether more chic appearance.''
   Mrs. Thatcher was listed this year by the annual International
Best Dressed Poll as one of the 12 best-dressed women.

<HEAD>Newspapers Jump To Defense of Duchess' Fashion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tabloids, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily Mirror and other British tabloids have
risen to the defense of the Duchess of York, criticizing American
designer Richard Blackwell for having ``the barefaced cheek'' to put
her on his worst-dressed list.
   The Mirror said Tuesday that Blackwell was ``so sensitive about
his own precious looks that he's had them rearranged four times.''
   Blackwell had hit out at the former Sarah Ferguson in a preview
of his list of the world's 10 worst-dressed women, saying she has
none of the style of her sister-in-law Princess Diana, that she
looks ``as if she makes beds in Ireland or milks cows,'' and that
she ``walks like a duck with a bad leg.''
   Until recently, the tabloids have not been great fans of the
duchess' wardrobe, saying it runs to frumpy, outrageous and
ill-fitting.
   But the 29-year-old commoner, who married Prince Andrew in 1986,
has worked hard to retrieve her svelte figure following the birth of
their daughter, Princess Beatrice, and her stylish, well-cut new
wardrobe has won plaudits from the tabloids.
   For the popular press, which has a near-obsession with royal
watching and prints the minutest pieces of trivia, the attack on the
duchess was over the top, and below-the-belt ripostes about
facelifts were only to be expected.
   ``What A Jerk,'' bannered the Sun, Britain's largest selling
daily, on Monday. It quoted American model Marie Helvin as saying
nobody ``takes a blind bit of notice'' of Blackwell. Hardy Amies, a
favorite designer of Queen Elizabeth II, was quoted as calling him
``a complete ignoramus.''
   The rival Daily Star, under the headline ``He's At It Again!,''
accused Blackwell of ``talking through his hat.''
   The Daily Mirror noted that Blackwell's attack came ``just as the
new, slim-line Fergie is winning over fashion critics here ... in
well-cut outfits which suit her figure.''
   The newspaper Today said the duchess' new look had come ``just
too late to spare her another blasting'' from Blackwell.
   A Mirror cartoon showed Blackwell strung up to a Christmas tree,
the duchess standing on the floor dressed as a milkmaid, and Andrew
saying: ``Now then, Mr. Blackwell, what was it you said about my
wife?''

<HEAD>Jury Reaches Verdict In Ackerman Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper executive's stepson was found
guilty today of attempted, willful, premeditated, first-degree
murder by a jury that also found he inflicted great bodily harm on
the girlfriend he tried to kill.
   Bradley Ackerman, 24, sat stone still as the jury's verdict was
announced in a packed courtroom.
   His stepfather, Daniel Ridder, sat in a front row of the
courtroom and remained grim-faced as the jury read the verdict.
   The jury, which reached its decision late Monday and kept it
sealed overnight, issued three separate verdicts _ one finding
Ackerman guilty of attempted murder, the second finding that he used
a firearm illegally and the third saying he intentionally inflicted
great bodily injury.
   Ackerman faces a maximum sentence of life in prison with the
possibility for parole.
   Neither the victim, Julie Alban, nor her family was in court when
the verdict was read.
   Ackerman pleaded innocent to attempted first-degree murder,
saying he was in a Valium-induced stupor June 8 when he shot Miss
Alban with a single bullet to the back, paralyzing her below the
waist.
   Ackerman, who had taken more than 20 pills, then shot himself in
the chest, inflicting a wound from which he later recovered.
   Prosecutors alleged that Ackerman, stepson of the chairman of the
Press-Telegram in Long Beach, fabricated the blackout defense to
avoid taking responsibility for shooting Miss Alban, 23, in her
parents' home.
   The defense urged the jury to return a verdict, at most, of
assault with a deadly weapon, which carries a maximum sentence of
six years in prison.
   Deputy District Attorney Ken Lamb portrayed Ackerman as a
selfish, irresponsible man who fired the .38-caliber revolver with
too much precision to be suffering from a drug-induced blackout.
   But defense attorney Anthony Murray blamed Ackerman's actions on
the diazepam that he purportedly took to kill himself. Ackerman was
in a state of depression partly caused by a $30,000 gambling debt
and his failure to fulfill his early promise as a tennis player.
   Ackerman testified that on the night of the shootings he only
remembered going to Miss Alban's home and laying out the contents of
his wallet on a bed. He said he didn't remember bringing the gun.
   Miss Alban, who attended the trial in her wheelchair, testified
that she awoke as the bullet pierced her spine, then dragged herself
to the telephone to call for help.

<HEAD>2.6 Million More Acres Placed in Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have contracted with the government to
take an additional 2.6 million acres of highly erodible cropland
from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Vern Neppl, an official of the department's Commodity Credit
Corp., said the last contracts were accepted from more than 3.4
million acres offered during the program's seventh signup period
held July 18 through Aug. 31. The total now under CRP, as the
program is called, is more than 28.2 million acres.
   Neppl said the eighth signup for the program has been scheduled
for Feb. 6-24.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for
10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers who are
accepted get annual rental payments from the government and one-time
assistance to pay for half the cost of planting trees, shrubs and
grass to guard against erosion.
   Neppl said the bids accepted for annual payments in the latest
round averaged $49.71 per acre. The average for the first six
signups was $48.38 per acre, he said.
   The goal of the CRP as set by Congress in the 1985 farm law is to
take 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland from
production by 1990.
   Here are the CRP acreages by state, with total program acreages
in the first column and the acreages from the seventh signup in the
second column:

   Former Rep. James Stanton of Ohio entered the
race for chairman of the National Democratic Party today, saying he
could ``revitalize the party structure and bring all Democrats under
the same roof.''
   Stanton became the fifth Democrat to announce for the top party
post to be filled in February by a vote of some 400 members of the
Democratic National Committee.
   Stanton said he recognized that he was not the frontrunner in the
race and said Michigan State Chairman Rick Wiener was ``obviously
the insider'' for the job being vacated by Paul Kirk.
   Stanton said he could unite the party ``because I am not the
candidate of the South or the candidate of the Northeast or the
candidate of the right or the left. I am simply the candidate of the
Democratic party, the whole party.''
   Stanton said he expected to compete with Ron Brown, former top
aide to Jesse Jackson, for organized labor's support. The other two
candidates are former Rep. James Jones of Oklahoma and former Rep.
Michael Barnes of Maryland.
   Ohio Sens. John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum have endorsed Stanton
for the post, but Ohio Democratic Chairman James Ruvulo and Vice
Chair Thea Boyd on Monday lined up behind Wiener.
   Wiener on Monday announced the support of 13 other state party
leaders from the Midwest. They include the state party chairs from
North Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Nebraska and Indiana as well as vice chairs from several states.
   Stanton said he's confident Democratic National Committee members
who examine his background will be convinced he's right for the job.
   ``I've built a ward organization; I've run a city council; I've
run an $800 million business,'' Stanton said Monday. ``I have the
communications skills to talk to the people who are going to
financially energize any political party in this country.''
   ``I believe I have a very viable chance to win,'' Stanton said.
   Stanton's decision followed a lengthy testing-the-waters period.
   Stanton is a former congressman and Cleveland City Council
president who dropped out of public life after a 1976 Democratic
Primary loss to Metzenbaum.
   Metzenbaum, Glenn, Ohio Reps. Mary Rose Oakar and Louis Stoes and
former House Speaker Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts last week signed a
mailgram urging union leaders to back Stanton.
   The party's new leader is to be chosen at a meeting in Washington
Feb. 9 and 10.

   A federal grand jury indicted a chemist and six
other people in the distribution of the synthetic narcotic China
White, which has been blamed for 13 deaths in the Pittsburgh area.
   Thomas L. Schaefers, 48, of suburban Aspinwall was charged in the
33-count indictment handed up Monday of manufacturing
3-methylfentanyl in his basement and distributing it to two men who
died of overdoses in May and July.
   Schaefers is accused of producing the drug in several batches
from late 1987 to September or October of this year. After police
raided his house Dec. 1, they determined that about six ounces of
the drug, which is similar to heroin, had reached the street, mostly
in October and November.
   Police believe as much as an additional 24 ounces of China White
from the batches _ enough for thousands of individual doses _
remains unaccounted for.
   Schaefers, who was arrested when his house was raided, is being
held on bond. The other six were indicted on distribution charges.
   Federal narcotics law provides a mandatory minimum 20-year prison
term and a maximum of life in prison for those convicted of
producing or distributing a controlled substance that causes a death.

   City transit officials have decided the best
solution to employees who pocket fare money is to get rid of the
pockets.
   ``Opportunity makes the thief,'' said Gordana Swanson, president
of the Southern California Rapid Transit District board. She
endorsed a plan Monday to immediately distribute pocketless uniforms
to all workers who handle bus fares.
   Money counters for the regional public bus system handle about
$130 million in cash per year, and officials hope that overalls
without pockets and other security measures will put the brakes on
fare box thievery.
   An audit completed in May showed the Southern California Rapid
Transit District could be losing millions of dollars each year to
casual pilferage or organized theft.
   ``In the counting rooms, workers have had uniforms without
pockets for years,'' said Steve Sibilsky, a Transit District
spokesman. ``The personnel who are going to be getting uniforms are
the maintenance people who handle the vaults.''

<HEAD>AIDS On Track To Become Fifth-Leading Killer Among Youth</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS pvs 7th, 8th, 10th grafs to correct numbers mentioned

   AIDS in a few years is likely to become the
fifth leading killer of Americans from birth to age 24 if present
trends continue, say federal health officials.
   Meanwhile, a General Accounting Office report says President
Reagan's Domestic Policy Council got in the way of Public Health
Service officials' attempts at launching an anti-AIDS education
program in the spring of 1987.
   The report is also critical of television networks for declining
to run many anti-AIDS public service spots when they did become
available, particularly those dealing with condoms as a way to
prevent spread of the deadly virus.
   The report, issued last week, said further that ther were
problems with getting a national AIDS hotline operating at full
speed, although it said those lapses had been mostly corrected by
last summer.
   Meanwhile, Dr. Antonia Novello, deputy director of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told Health and
Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen on Monday that AIDS is
already the ninth leading cause of death among children 1 to 4 years
old and the seventh leading cause of deaths among young people age
15 to 24.
   If present trends continue, she said, the disease soon will move
up to No. 5.
   The five leading causes of death among people age 15 to 24 in
1985, the last year for which figures are available, were accidents,
suicide, homicide, cancer and heart disease.
   For people age 5 to 14, the top five in 1985 were accidents,
cancer, birth defects, homicide and heart disease.
   For children from 1 to 4, the top four were accidents, birth
defects, cancer, and heart disease.
   For infants under 1, the leading causes were complications at
birth, birth defects, ``ill-defined conditions,'' accidents and
pneumonia and flu.
   As of Dec. 12, 1,291 cases of AIDS had been reported among
infants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the
13-to-19-year group. Of those, 717 who were under 13 at the time of
their diagnosis have already died, along with 174 who were
adolescents when diagnosed.
   ``The official figures include only those children whose
condition was reported to the Centers for Disease Control,'' said a
report from a task force headed by Novello. ``Probably for every
child who meets the CDC definition of AIDS, another two to 10 are
infected with HIV. It is estimated that by 1991 there will be at
least 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children in the United States.''
   HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and health officials are
growing increasingly concerned that a large majority of those
infected eventually will develop AIDS and die.
   The GAO report, requested by Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said
that even though the Centers For Disease Control's AIDS education
budget increased from about $17 million in fiscal 1985 to nearly
$210 million in 1988, ``its efforts to focus national attention on
AIDS prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key
activities aimed at the general public.''
   GAO said CDC decided in May 1987 to designate the following
October as ``AIDS Awareness and Prevention Month,'' but was unable
to get clearance from the White House Domestic Policy Council _ a
Cabinet group _ for its plans to conduct a national AIDS information
mailing to all households.
   Congress had made clear it thought such a mailing should be done,
but had not explicitly required it. Congress made a mailing
mandatory the following year and the pamphlet ``Understanding AIDS''
went out to more than 100 million households last June.
   In conjunction with ``AIDS Awareness and Prevention Month'' in
1987, CDC contracted for production of 38 public service
announcements on AIDS and distributed them to the major television
networks on Sept. 30, 1987, the report said.
   However, it said there was only one airing by a network during
the following month and only six the following months.
   When ads did air, they were not likely to be seen by many people.
Between December 1987 and February 1988, GAO reported, nearly 90
percent of all network-aired AIDS public service announcements were
shown during non-primetime viewing hours. Nearly 60 percent were
shown between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., GAO said.

<HEAD>GNP Rises Moderately, But Fed Still Expected To Hike Interest Rates</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

   The economy expanded at a moderate 2.5 percent
pace during the July-September quarter, the government reported
Tuesday, but analysts said growth was rebounding and the Federal
Reserve Board probably will nudge interest rates higher as a result.
   The Commerce Department said growth of the gross national
product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed during the
third quarter from 3.0 percent in the 2nd quarter and 3.4 percent in
the first three months of the year.
   The GNP, after adjusting for inflation, rose $24.2 billion to an
annual rate of $4.01 trillion in the third quarter.
   The GNP figure for the third quarter, the slowest expansion pace
since the final quarter of 1986, was a slight downward revision from
a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent issued a month ago. Most
economists had been looking for a slight upward adjustment.
   The trend should be good news for Federal Reserve policy makers
who want to curb economic growth to a range of 2 percent to 2.5
percent, which they believe is sustainable without increasing
inflation.
   However, the government said the temporary effects of the summer
drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures, are masking the
true strength of the economy in the final nine months of the year.
   Drought losses of $12.3 billion reduced the GNP growth rate by
0.9 percentage points in the second quarter, 0.5 percentage points
in the third and will knock more than 1.0 percent off of fourth
quarter rate.
   The growth rate in the final three months of this year, excluding
the effects of the drought, will top 3 percent, most economists
believe. In the first half of next year, assuming a return to normal
farm production, the economy will be expanding at a rate between 3
percent and 4 percent, they say.
   ``What you're left with is an economy that is growing too fast to
be acceptable to the Federal Reserve,'' said Robert G. Dederick, an
economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Fed members fear that a GNP growth rate higher than the target
range will strain factory capacity, leading to shortages and
resulting price increases. Also, by boosting employment, the growth
encourages employers to bid up wages. The Fed's ``cure'' is higher
interest rates designed to make it more expensive for consumers and
businesses to spend.
   The Fed began nudging interest rates higher in late March,
capping a series of tightening moves in August with a rise in the
discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to member banks.
   When economic statistics for October and November made it clear
that growth remained robust, the Fed responded last week by bumping
up the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for
overnight loans, by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 8|
percent to 8~ percent.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities dealer in New York, said the next tightening
move likely will come in the first two weeks of next month, with
another quarter point rise in the federal funds rate.
   ``I think the Fed will have to lean somewhat against those
(strong growth) winds with a series of modest tightening steps,''
but it will delay raising the discount rate. ``If anything, the Fed
is in danger of underreacting.''
   However, other economists, noting that consumer prices are rising
at a 4.4 percent annual rate in 1988, the same as last year, say
inflation fears are overstated.
   ``What we're afraid of is the Federal Reserve will get carried
away next year and raise interest rates too high and keep them too
high too long,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources
Inc., a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. ``We might end up with
a recession in late 1989 or early 1990.''
   But Dederick and Jones noted that a GNP price index, which
measures price increases in what Americans are producing as opposed
to what they are buying, shot up at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in
the third quarter, the biggest jump in six years. That was up from a
5.0 percent rate in the second quarter.
   In an accompanying report, the Commerce Department said corporate
profits after taxes advanced 3.9 percent in the third quarter after
soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. An earlier estimate,
which did not take into account profits by overseas subsidiaries of
U.S. corporations, had said third quarter profits rose only a slight
0.2 percent.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa was
declared winner Tuesday of Sri Lanka's presidential election, and he
appealed for an end to the killing that has crippled this tropical
island nation.
   ``The ballots of the people have triumphed over the bullets of
brutality,'' Premadasa said.
   ``The politics of terror has no place in the temple of
democracy,'' he said. ``I will eradicate fear and suppression. I
will restore law and order.''
   Premadasa's victory with slightly more than half of the votes
ended a campaign marked by hundreds of slayings, which the
government blames on the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese
extremist group that opposed the balloting.
   Police said members of the group hacked and shot to death nine
supporters of Premadasa's party Tuesday in Bandarawela, 76 miles
east of Colombo.
   A 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was imposed on the nation of 16 million
to prevent violence after the results were announced.
   ``I have an appeal to make to those who have still to join the
democratic process,'' Premadasa said in a nationally televised
address. ``Your participation will enable us to eradicate fear and
poverty with greater speed.''
   He also stretched a conciliatory hand to the two losing
candidates, although an adviser to the runner-up, former Prime
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, said she was not accepting the final
results.
   The intimidation campaign by the Sinhalese extremists kept many
people from the polls Monday. Only 55 percent of 9.3 million
eligible voters turned out to vote compared with 80 percent in the
last presidential election six years ago.
   Premadasa received 50.4 percent of the vote, followed by Mrs.
Bandaranaike of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party with 44.9
percent, according to election Commissioner Chandrananda de Silva.
   He said no balloting took place in parts of eastern Moneragala
district because no polling officers had arrived, but he added that
the three candidates agreed not to make an issue out of it.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike had no immediate comment. But Kumar
Ponnambalam, a spokesman for the five-party Democratic Peoples'
Alliance that backed her, said the candidate sent a letter to the
Elections Commissioner ``requesting him not to announce results
since she is not accepting the final count.''
   When Premadasa takes over Sri Lanka's most powerful government
post Jan. 2, he will be working with a new Parliament, which was
dissolved Tuesday by outgoing President Junius R. Jayewardene.
   Jayewardene has ruled for 11 years and was barred by the
constitution from seeking a third term. Parliamentary elections are
scheduled for Feb. 15.
   The president serves for six years and appoints the prime
minister and other ministers.
   In Washington, the State Department said ``we look forward to
working closely with President-elect Premadasa to strengthen further
the warm relationship we have enjoyed with Sri Lanka under President
Jayewardene.''
   ``The people and the leadership of Sri Lanka have displayed
laudable courage and determination in holding presidential elections
in defiance of terrorist threats,'' the department said in a brief
statement.
   The current cycle of violence in Sri Lanka, an island once famed
as an idyllic tourist resort, dates from 1983, when the Tamil ethnic
minority began its uprising against the majority Sinalhese. Nearly
10,000 people have been killed since then.
   With the help of neighboring India, the subcontinent's superpower
and home to 60 million Tamils, Jayewardene signed a peace accord in
July 1987 aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency.
   Premadasa opposed the plan despite being a top government
official and boycotted the signing ceremony.
   The pact guaranteed some autonomy to the Tamils, who comprise 18
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and invited India to help
end the uprising by sending troops, which now total 47,000.
   The People's Liberation Front vehemently opposes the pact, saying
the government should not compromise with the Tamils.
   The Tamil Tiger rebels seeking an independent state also oppose
the accord, and are fighting Indian soldiers in the northeast.
   Premadasa has called for the phased or immediate withdrawal of
Indian troops, but dealing with the huge neighbor could prove
difficult.
   Indian High Commissioner J.N. Dixit has indicated his country
won't accept unilateral action.
   ``The peace pact was a bilateral one and the unilateral
abrogation by one side will create an unprecedented situation,'' he
said recently. ``As far as India is concerned, we are firmly
committed to the accord.''
   Premadasa also stressed his determination to fight poverty in Sri
Lanka, where the annual per capital income is $360. He has proposed
giving $75 a month to the poorest families, but has not explained
how to pay for the program.

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board today
blamed improperly loaded cargo for the crash of a commuter plane in
Alaska last year that killed 18 people.
   The board said the Ryan Air Service flight crew failed to
properly oversee the loading of the craft and that so much of the
cargo was loaded in the rear that the pilot lost control of the
plane.
   ``The real responsibility rested with the crew, which is
responsible for supervising the loading of the aircraft,'' said
James L. Kolstad, acting chairman of the NTSB. ``For reasons I guess
we'll never know, they failed in that function.''
   The twin-engine turboprop crashed on approach to Homer Airport in
Homer, Alaska, on Nov. 23, 1987. Eighteen of the 21 people on board
were killed.
   Investigators had believed that ice on the aircraft might have
contributed to the accident, but the board said the ice ``did not
cause but may have exacerbated the loss of control.''
   The crash was Ryan Air's 10th in eight years, and the company had
been fined 10 months before the crash for record-keeping violations.
While the board did not explicitly clear Ryan Air for any blame in
the accident, it adopted no conclusions that the commuter airline
was at fault.
   The staff report was adopted on a 4-1 vote, with board member Jim
Burnett voting no because he first wanted to see changes in wording
that were agreed to in the board's meeting.

   Citing a lack of storage facilities and other
problems, the State Department is urging Americans to send money
instead of relief supplies to earthquake victims in Soviet Armenia.
   ``The relief lines are clogged up,'' said Rene Bafalis, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance who
returned Sunday from the scene of the earthquake.
   In addition to inadequate storage space, she said sorting out the
clothing, blankets and other items being donated from abroad
presents problems for local authorities because of the large
quantities involved.
   She said Soviet authorities turned back at least one flight
carrying relief supplies because of the backlog.
   ``The system is really overwhelmed,'' she said.
   Ms. Bafalis recommended that Americans make cash donations
through either the American Red Cross or to local Armenian
organizations involved in earthquake relief.

   The tale of a priest who was forced to sell two
prized lithographs to pay overdue bills at his jobs center generated
sympathy and money, but questions have arisen about the man's past.
   One potential donor said he canceled plans to raise at least
$10,000 for the Rev. John DaeCheck's New Times Service Center in
Glassport.
   And the bank handling contributions, Union National Bank in
Glassport, decided to close the account Tuesday because of
skepticism about DaeCheck, said manager Jack Katona. DaeCheck opened
the account Monday with $500.
   DaeCheck acknowledged he has had some brushes with authorities,
including an investigation by the U.S. Postal Service regarding a
publishing company he owned that filed for bankruptcy.
   But Glassport Police Chief Edward Mihoces defends DaeCheck.
   ``What he has done outside isn't important,'' the chief said.
``He does help people.''
   Some of the center's clients, workers displaced by the decline of
the Monongahela Valley's steel industry, said last week that
DaeCheck had helped them obtain retraining and submit resumes.
   DaeCheck said he founded the non-profit jobs center seven months
ago in part to make up for past mistakes and has only the center's
welfare at heart.
   ``We've been here for seven months doing good work. Hopefully
I'll be here another seven months doing good work or until it's
needed,'' he said.
   To get money for the center's phone bill, DaeCheck last week sold
two 19th-century French lithographs, one a Daumier, for $500 to a
Pittsburgh businessman, who also donated an additional $800 to the
center.
   Bell of Pennsylvania agreed to continue phone service because of
assurances the bill of more than $300 would be paid.
   DaeCheck's advertisements offering the bargain-priced lithos
attracted attention, and he told The Associated Press last week that
he was pastor of an independent Russian Orthodox Church called St.
Paul's in Washington, Pa. He said the jobs center was a mission of
the church.
   But after questions arose, DaeCheck said he does not have a
congregation or conduct services. He explained Monday that St.
Paul's Church is actually St. Paul's Mission, part of All-Faith
Church Mission Inc. in Washington, founded by the Revs. Harry and
Helen Harrington.
   The Harringtons said they ordained DaeCheck and hundreds of
people based on the applicant's knowledge of the Bible and belief in
God.
   DaeCheck said he briefly attended but did not graduate from
Savanarolo Theological Seminary in Scranton, operated by the Polish
National Catholic Church, a branch of the Old Catholic Church of
Holland.
   DaeCheck also said he was ordained in Washington, D.C., in 1981
by Bishop James Miller of the Orthodox Church of America. That
church, he said, was based in Anderson, S.C., and is distinct from
the bettern-known Orthodox Church in America.
   But the rector of the Savanarolo seminary, the Very Rev. Edward
Brzostowski, said Monday he had no records of DaeCheck's attendance.
Brzostowski and Bishop Kyrill of the western Pennsylvania diocese of
the Orthodox Church in America said they never heard of Orthodox
Church of America. Directory assistance in Anderson, S.C., also had
no listing for the church or Miller.
   ``If Bishop Miller isn't around ... there's not much I can do for
you,'' DaeCheck said. ``My orders come from the Orthodox Church of
America.''
   DaeCheck started the publishing company in 1974. He said he went
out of business in 1982 after publishing about 150 books on a
cooperative basis with the authors.
   ``A lot of people are probably very bitter that I went
bankrupt,'' he said. ``I went through a terrible time.''
   Caren Mariani, deputy state attorney general in charge of the
Bureau of Consumer Protection in Pittsburgh, said DaeCheck failed to
publish manuscripts, make refunds on time or register the business
with the state. In June 1985, DaeCheck agreed to reimburse seven
authors a total of $5,354.
   The postal service investigated DaeCheck but never charged him
with any crime, said Postal Inspector Bruce Stutzman.
   DaeCheck's background was enough to make Neal Holmes, owner of
Allied Security of Pittsburgh, cancel plans to organize business
people interested in giving $10,000 to the center.
   ``I think I'm going to back off,'' Holmes said Monday.

   Underground Palestinian leaders Tuesday called
general strikes for Christmas Eve and the Epiphany holiday on which
Orthodox churches mark Christ's birth.
   The strike call for Dec. 24 and Jan. 6 follows a dispute between
authorities and local Palestinian officials over whether Christmas
celebrations would be held this year in the biblical city of
Bethlehem during the Arab uprising against Israeli occupation.
   The army, meanwhile, reported it demolished three houses and
sealed a fourth Tuesday in the occupied West Bank, saying the houses
belonged to members of a gang who attacked an Israeli civilian and a
policeman.
   Three Palestinians were wounded during clashes between soldiers
and stone-throwing youths in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab
hospital sources said.
   The call for general strikes was issued in a leaflet distributed
in the West Bank and signed by the PLO-backed leaders of the
yearlong Palestinian uprising.
   The leaflet called for strikes ``as a rejection of the occupation
and a rejection of any Israeli participation in the Christmas
celebration.''
   It urged Palestinian stores, which have been open only from 9
a.m. to noon during much of the uprising, to remain open all day on
Dec. 23 and Jan. 5 ``so our Christian brothers can buy what they
need.''
   Distribution of the leaflet came as Israeli officials disputed
statements by Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij that Christmas
celebrations would be curtailed this year because of the
``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising.
   Israeli tourism officials put out statements saying that the
usual choir concert would be held in Manger Square, adjacent to the
Church of the Nativity, which contains the grotto where Christ was
born.
   On Tuesday, Israeli soldiers put up decorative Christmas lights
and a sign saying ``Merry Xmas and Happy New Year'' on the road to
Bethlehem and were constructing a stage for the concert in Manger
Square.
   Freij, a Christian Palestinian, had announced that no lighted
Christmas tree would be displayed in the square this year and boy
scouts would not take part in the traditional parade with church
leaders.
   He said this was because many West Bank residents did not feel
like celebrating after the yearlong uprising in which more than 330
Palestinians have been killed, nine of them from the Bethlehem area.
Thirteen Israelis also have died.
   Bethlehem, once a small town populated mostly by Palestinian
Christians, now has a population of about 35,000, many of them
Moslems displaced by the founding of Israel in 1948.
   The leaflet also called for two other general strikes in late
December and early January.
   It praised the United States for announcing last week it would
open a dialogue with the PLO, calling the U.S. move ``a victory for
the intefadeh.'' The leaflet also urged carrying on with the
uprising ``as a national duty.''
   ``We must double our efforts ... so we can strike against the
occupation army,'' it said.
   An army announcement Tuesday said soldiers demolished three
houses and sealed one in the West Bank town of Jenin and the nearby
village of Beit Qad after uncovering a gang of 14 members who
carried out attacks on Israelis.
   The houses belonged to four members of the gang who played a
major role in violence, which included the stabbing of an Israeli
civilian and an attack on a policeman, the army said.
   An army spokesman said he did not know if all the members of the
gang had been arrested or if any of them had been charged with
crimes or tried.
   Israeli troops also raided at least four villages in the West
Bank, forcing residents to paint over anti-Israeli graffiti,
destroying olive groves and conducting searches for suspects, Arab
reports said.
   An army spokesman said troops carried out some raids on
Palestinian villages Tuesday, but he could not give the number or
exact location. He said no arrests were made.
   The spokesman confirmed a youth was shot by troops who fired on
stone-throwers in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, the West
Bank's largest city. He said he was checking the reports of other
injuries.
   Hospital officials said a 15-year-old was suffered a bullet wound
in the buttocks in a clash with soldiers in the West Bank village of
Ain Arik and another youth was shot in the Shati refugee camp in the
Gaza Strip.
   The clash in Ain Arik, near Ramallah, erupted after Israeli
troops brought in bulldozers to destroy groves of olive and lemon
trees that youths used as cover to throw stones at passing Israeli
buses, Arab reports said.

   Christmas should be a hopping good time for
Quasimodo, who'll make the leap from pet store prodigy to house pet
for some lucky youngster.
   The rare red-eyed, albino bullfrog has lived at Don Sutton's shop
for 18 months, greeting customers and entertaining hundreds of
children. But this Christmas, Quasimodo is being adopted for the
princely price of $59.97.
   At first, viewers may mistake Quasimodo for a plastic toy,
because of his out-of-the-ordinary yellow color and his practice of
sitting motionless for long periods. But underneath, he's all frog.
   Quasimodo's unusual color is due to a lack of sufficient
pigmentation to make him the run-of-the-mill-pond brownish green. He
was a highly unusual find for Sutton, who bought Quasimodo from a
wholesale dealer.
   ``It was unusual that he was found before he was eaten,'' he
said. ``Most albino frogs stand out so much they are gobbled up by
other predators. Somehow he survived long enough to get captured.''
   The nearly 2-year-old frog is still growing, and in the security
of his new family, he can be expected to live eight to 10 years,
Sutton said.

   Iron is discoloring the water in Waterford
Township, and hairdressers say they're not the only ones who know
for sure.
   Residents of the Oakland County community who shampoo with the
rusty public water supply complain that it's turning their hair
yellow, orange and even green, an undesireable shade even in this
holiday season.
   ``What (the iron) is doing is depositing on blond hair or any
type of hair and it builds up,'' said beauty salon owner Cyndi
Edwards. ``I've had cases where the hair turns green.''
   Some of the township's public wells contain iron levels six times
higher than Michigan guidelines, state and county officials said.
The iron doesn't pose any known health threats, but it makes the
water taste bitter, smell bad, stain laundry and clog pipes.
   The township could end the problem by tying into Detroit's water
network, according to a report issued last week by the Waterford
Water Quality Committee.

   The failures of the U.S. space program
over the past 30 years are highlighted in an unusual exhibit.
   The exhibit at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center features
the remains of the Mercury-Atlas I, the ill-fated, unmanned rocket
that exploded less than one minute after liftoff on July 29, 1960.
   The remains were retrieved from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean
more than 20 years ago and previously were housed in a museum in
Orlando, Fla.
   The exhibit, which opened Monday, also includes a backup unit for
Project Vanguard, the U.S. response to the Soviet Sputnik. Vanguard,
launched Dec. 6, 1957, rose six inches and collapsed.
   But the display is not only about failures. ``This shows the
difficulties we faced in getting man, and rockets, into space,''
said Max Ary, executive director of the space museum.
   There is a wall-sized mural of President John F. Kennedy. An old
RCA television sitting in a recreation of a 30-year-old livingroom
plays Kennedy's speech to Congress in which he proposed the Apollo
moon-landing program.
   ``I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving
the goal before the decade is out of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to Earth,'' Kennedy said.
   A brief video called ``39 Percent Success Rate'' provides a light
look at some of the 80 U.S. unmanned satellite launches, 49 of which
ended in failure.
   A block house blast window _ a 250-pound chunk of glass that
shielded the launch crew at Cape Canaveral _ sits in the middle of
the exhibit.

   A pirate rock 'n' roll ship operating off the coast
of New York can't continue broadcasting without a license from the
Federal Communications Commission, a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge John J. McNaught issued a summary judgment
Dec. 13 against Al Weiner, former owner of the Sarah and one of four
defendants, who contended the radio ship had a constitutional right
to broadcast without an FCC license on ``open and unused
frequencies.''
   Weiner's attorney, Jeremiah Gutman, an American Civil Liberties
Union lawyer, had argued that the Sarah was a foreign-registered
ship in international waters and didn't come under the scope of the
FCC. He also maintained that since the station, Radio New York
International, was broadcasting on an unassigned AM frequency, the
FCC was violating First Amendment rights to free speech.
   McNaught rejected those arguments, noting that the government
said numerous stations could be subject to interference if the Sarah
broadcast.
   Weiner has said he launched the pirate station to protest what he
called conformity in New York-area radio programming.
   The Sarah has broadcast only twice. In July 1987, it broadcast of
Long Island, N.Y., for about four days and then agents of the FCC
and the U.S. Coast Guard boarded the ship and stopped broadcasts.
The Sarah was towed to Boston after Weiner promised a federal court
in Brooklyn he would cease operations.
   ``Everybody in the project is absolutely frustrated,'' Weiner
said Tuesday. ``We could go on the air and not harm or create one
single problem. It's just that we've got a hysterical FCC.''
   Weiner maintained that the Sarah is an international ship because
it is registered in Sealand, a self-proclaimed principality in the
North Sea off the coast of the United Kingdom. Prosecutors argued
that Britain does not recognize Sealand and recently extended its
territorial limit to include the unofficial country.
   The judge said the defendants ``could not look to the First
Amendment for authority to broadcast on an unoccupied frequency in
violation of both federal and international law. The First Amendment
does not grant anyone the right to broadcast by radio.''

<TEXT>
   The inauguration of President-elect Bush,
billed as the most open inaugural celebration ever, is now open to
contributors who want to give less than $100,000.
   The Presidential Inaugural Committee said Monday it has dropped a
$100,000 minimum requirement covering private donations for
inaugural activities ranging from galas to children's festivals.
   ``The committee simply never anticipated the number of people or
corporations that would want to participate ... at various levels.
We've been overwhelmed,'' said committee spokesman Ed Cassidy.
   Organizers of the Bush inaugural have said it will have more free
events and include more of the public than any previous
inauguration, reflecting the wishes and style of the Bush family.
   Time pressure prompted the initial decision to limit donations to
$100,000 or more, Cassidy said. He said accepting smaller amounts
would have been too complex from an administrative standpoint.
   At this stage, he said, ``preparations are well under way and
initial financing has been secured; our goal is to enable as many
other individuals and corporations to participate as possible.''
   The $100,000 minimum on private contributions had been criticized
as giving wealthy corporations a way to curry favor with the
incoming administration. The private donations are not
tax-deductible.
   There is no disclosure requirement for private donations, and
inaugural officials have said they do not plan to release detailed
lists of contributors.
   Cassidy declined to say how many corporations and individuals
were seeking to contribute less than $100,000 or what the lowest
offer had been. Contributions must be linked to specific inaugural
activities and events.
   In a related matter, Cassidy said the committee has reached its
goal of $20 million in guaranteed loans. Two hundred corporations
and individuals have put up $100,000 apiece under that program,
which is designed to secure up-front operating money for the
committee.
   The interest-free loans will be repaid after the inauguration
from private donations and proceeds from the sale of souvenirs and
tickets to balls, dinners and other activities.

   Fire broke out in two engine rooms of a
passenger ferry in the English Channel on Tuesday, but no one was
injured and firefighters put out the flames, the coast guard said.
   The Sally Star, with 373 passengers and 109 crew members en route
to Dunkirk, France, was four miles from Ramsgate harbor when the
fire started about 9:30 a.m., said a spokesman for the coast guard
in Dover.
   The passengers remained on board as the crew tried to keep the
fire under control until a Royal Air Force helicopter brought 20
firefighters to the scene, said Michael Kingshott, managing director
of Sally Line Ltd., the ferry's owner. He said the fire was
contained by a system that pumped carbon dioxide into the engine
rooms to starve the flames of oxygen.
   The blaze, which started near the main boiler, blistered paint on
the vessel's walls, according to the firefighters.
   The ferry company and the British Department of Tranport have
ordered investigations into the blaze. The ferry was towed back to
Ramsgate.

<TEXT>
   The World Court on Tuesday ruled it
has the authority to deal with a Nicaraguan complaint that
neighboring Honduras is supporting rebels fighting Managua's
Sandinista government.
   The ruling was the latest step in a dispute between the two
Central American nations that has been before the court since 1986.
A final decision is not expected before 1990.
   Nicaragua has said Honduras is actively supporting the Contra
insurgents and is seeking a court-ordered halt to the alleged
assistance.
   Honduras, however, has been contending the World Court has no
jurisdiction in the case. It says it limited its acceptance of World
Court jurisdiction one month before Nicaragua filed the complaint in
July 1986.
   The Sandinista complaint came one month after Nicaragua won a
World Court condemnation of Reagan administration support for the
Contras.
   Tuesday's ruling means the court, formally known as the
International Court of Justice, can examine the merits of the
Nicaragua-Honduran dispute.
   The 15-judge forum is the judicial arm of the United Nations. It
has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
rulings.

<HEAD>`Brady Christmas' Gives CBS Second Place</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS got a ``A Very Brady Christmas'' gift when
the reunion movie featuring the 1970s sitcom family was No. 2 in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. television ratings, giving CBS its first week out
of third place this season.
   NBC firmly won the week anyway, and ``The Cosby Show'' was the
No. 1 show last week.
   As of Saturday, CBS was still in third place in the Nielsens, but
Sunday's ``A Very Brady Christmas'' was the highest-rated
made-for-TV movie so far this season, with a rating of 25.1 and a 39
share, and boosted CBS into second place. The sitcom ``The Brady
Bunch'' ran on ABC from 1969-1974 and has a cult following in reruns.
   ``The Cosby Show'' had a rating of 25.9 and a 42 share. The rest
of the top 10 were: ``A Different World,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC;
``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC;
``L.A. Law,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; and ``Dear John,''
NBC, tied with ``60 Minutes,'' CBS.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC won the week ending Dec. 18 with an average prime-time rating
of 15.4. CBS had a 13.1 and ABC an 11.8.
   ``ABC World News Tonight'' was the top-rated news show last week,
with an average rating of 11.0 and a 20 share. ``NBC Nightly News''
had a 10.9 and 20, edging the ``CBS Evening News,'' which had a 10.7
and 19.
   The only other new holiday movie last week, NBC's nostalgic
``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' also did well, ranking 15th.
   CBS' ``Wiseguy'' came in 32nd, apparently getting a boost from
guest star Jerry Lewis, who will appear in a continuing storyline
for several episodes of the crime drama.
   NBC's constroverial episode of ``Midnight Caller,'' about a San
Francisco man with AIDS purposely engaging in high-risk sex, ranked
33rd, doing no worse or better than it has so far this season. AIDS
organizations and gay-rights groups had protested the episode,
saying it promoted antagonism against AIDS victims.
   ABC's touted exercise in kiddie glasnost, ``Free to Be a
Family,'' a joint U.S.-Soviet broadcast, ranked 58th.
   The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: ``Davy
Crockett,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Moscow Circus,'' ``Annie
McGuire,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Simon & Simon,'' ``TV101,'' ``Murphy's
Law,'' ``Knightwatch'' and ``Burning Issues.''

<HEAD>Swiss Red Cross Workers Evacuate Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red
Cross withdrew its 17-member staff in Lebanon on Tuesday after the
workers received death threats.
   The Swiss delegates left Moslem west Beirut for the Christian
eastern sector, then boarded a ferry for Larnaca, Cyprus, said
police in the Christian port of Jounieh, north of Beirut. They will
fly to Switzerland on Wednesday.
   In Geneva, the all-Swiss organization said it had suspended its
humanitarian operations in Lebanon after hearing Monday ``that
serious threats had been made against its delegates on mission in
Lebanon, placing their lives in acute danger.''
   ``The ICRC therefore feels compelled to suspend its entire
humanitarian operation there and to repatriate all its expatriate
staff immediately,'' a Red Cross statement said.
   Tuesday's action by the Red Cross marked the first time in the
more than 100-year history of the organization that delegates were
withdrawn because of threats on their lives.
   A committee spokesman, Carlos Bauverd, declined to say how the
death threats were received and what group was believed behind them.
   The decision came four days after kidnappers released the chief
Red Cross delegate in south Lebanon, Peter Winkler, who was held
hostage for nearly a month.
   The kidnapping Nov. 16 prompted the Red Cross to scale down its
presence in Lebanon after 20 years of operations in the strife-torn
country. Ten of the organization's 27 delegates left, but 17
remained.
   Upon Winkler's release, Red Cross officials in Geneva said the
staff would soon be increased again and regular activities resumed.
   The communique said the committee was ready to resume its
operations in Lebanon as soon as the threats ``are clearly and
unequivocally withdrawn.''
   A rumor circulated in Geneva that the threats had been phoned to
the Swedish ambassador in Damascus, Rolf Gauffin.
   Gauffin was an intermediary in the contacts that preceded
Winkler's release. In those contacts, his kidnappers identified
themselves as members of a group called the ``Organization of
Socialist Revolution.''
   Swiss authorities said Winkler's captors tried to tie his release
to a lenient sentence for a Shiite Lebanese hijacker, Hussein
Hariri, who is to go on trial at the Swiss Supreme Court Feb. 20.
Swiss Foreign Minuister Rene Felber said Switzerland had refused any
concessions.
   Hariri hijacked an Air Afrique jetliner to Geneva July 14, 1987
and killed a French passenger before he was overpowered and
arrested. He faces up to life imprisonment.
   The Swiss made up the largest Western community remaining in west
Beirut after waves of kidnappings, assassinations and civil war
violence forced tens of thousands of foreigners to flee Lebanon in
the last 13 years.
   Police said the new exodus left less than 24 Westerners living in
west Beirut.
   Fifteen foreign hostages are now being held in Lebanon. They
include nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a
Belgian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Red Cross delegates operate in about 80 countries worldwide,
visiting prisoners and detainees and providing food and medical
relief to civilian victims of armed conflict.
   Their work is primarily based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions on
the protection of prisoners and civilians in time of war.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old boy whose Christmas looked
so bleak he wrapped up empty boxes to decorate his apartment wrote
Santa Claus a letter 100 elves couldn't ignore.
   The letter said: ``The only gift i would like is an elecric
wheelchair for my mom. She can't walk and her hands are to weak for
the one welfair gave her 2 years ago. I would love to see her
outside without help and watch me play. Can you help me with my wish?
   ``Love, John F. Wonggoun.''
   Victoria Coslett, 39, was unaware that her son wrote the letter.
She learned about it Monday when a postal worker dressed as Santa
Claus arrived at her apartment laden with presents _ including a
gift certificate for a motorized wheelchair. Both mom and son were
partially disabled in a 1981 traffic accident.
   The 100 elves who interceded for Santa and handled John's request
work at the U.S. Postal Service in Palm Springs.
   ``We receive about 1,000 letters a year to Santa Claus,'' said
Postmaster Linda Avalos. ``The staff answers each and every one. But
this is the first time we've been able to do more than just write
back.''
   The wheelchair was donated by an Eastern manufacturer contacted
by All Active Mobility, a Riverside organization that works with the
handicapped. The postal workers contributed $375 for its upkeep.
   A grocery store chipped in for Christmas dinner. And there were
presents for John too.
   But John said: ``The wheelchair is the best of all.''
   After the 1981 accident, Ms. Coslett was left with herniated
discs in her lower back. John, who attends a public school for
disabled children, was partially brain damaged and still suffers
seizures and memory lapses. He also suffers from juvenile arthritis.
   ``He's been through a lot,'' Ms. Coslett said. ``My husband left
me in 1984 and we stayed at the Salvation Army for three weeks in
Texas. They gave us a bus ticket out here. But by the time we got
here we had only $2 to our name. All we had to eat was cereal for
the first month.''
   Because Ms. Coslett could afford no presents on her disability
pension check this year, John wrapped several empty boxes and put
them under the family's Christmas tree.
   Ms. Coslett said her son has always been selfless.
   ``We went to the mall the other day with a friend. (I) gave John
$10 to buy something for himself. He went into a store and came out
with a pair of earrings for me,'' Ms. Coslett said.
   ``When I asked him why he didn't buy a toy for himself, he said,
`You told me I could do anything I want with the money.'''
   ``It's been hard for him to believe in Santa Claus,'' Ms. Coslett
said. ``But I keep telling him he has to believe.''
   John said he did not expect an answer to his letter. ``I thought
I was the last person who would get something from Santa,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The American Israel Public Affairs Committee
has been shaken by internal turmoil in recent months, raising
concerns about the powerful pro-Israeli lobby's relations with
Congress and its ability to protect the Jewish state from the
fallout of strained relations with the administration.
   The latest setback to befall AIPAC is last week's resignation of
its legislative director, Douglas Bloomfield, the organization's
respected and popular liaison with Congress. It follows several
unfavorable news reports about the generally low-profile group,
based partly on documents supplied by disgruntled AIPAC employees.
   Included among the allegations were that AIPAC violated its
mandate by supporting candidates in the recent congressional
elections and that it mapped out a campaign to smear the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
   Observers and insiders differ on whether AIPAC's problems are a
result of personality clashes or a reflection of fundamental policy
differences within the organization, which is viewed as possessing
almost mythical clout in this power-conscious city.
   But all agree it could not have come at a worse time for Israel
and the American Jewish community.
   The paternalistic alliance between Washington and Jerusalem is
being strained by last week's U.S. decision to launch talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization. The decision, taken after PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat declared he recognized Israel's right to
exist, is viewed by Israel's leadership as betraying a promise given
13 years ago not to deal with its arch-enemy.
   U.S.-Israel ties will be put to a further test in the months
ahead by requests from Saudi Arabia for millions of dollars worth of
arms sales. There are indications the administration of
President-elect Bush may be more inclined to acquiesce to those
requests, which were turned down under congressional pressure in
recent years.
   Jewish leaders also are concerned that Bush and his chief of
staff, John Sununu, who is of Arab ancestry, may be less committed
to Israel's security than the Reagan administration, and especially
in comparison with outgoing Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``It's now more important than ever that Congress remain
committed to Israel,'' said Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., who
works closely with AIPAC and strongly supports the $3 billion annual
U.S. foreign aid to Israel.
   Berman and others in Congress who work closely with AIPAC say
they perceive a shift from the organization's emphasis on lobbying
the legislative branch to lobbying the executive branch. Others
charge AIPAC's leadership, especially Chairman Robert Asher and
President Edward Levy, with a pro-Republican bias that damns them in
the eyes of the Democratic majority on Capitol Hill.
   ``The partisanship that is perceived as creeping into AIPAC's
decision-making will hurt them in the long run,'' said Democratic
Rep. Lawrence Smith of Florida, who has been instrumental in
opposing arms sales to the Arabs.
   ``They have to understand that the real bedrock of support for
Israel is the Congress. Administrations come and go. We're pretty
constant and reliable,'' Smith said.
   The perception of AIPAC's partisan leanings appears due in part
to an eight-year Republican administration which has been warmly
supportive of Israel. For example, Jewish leaders say they were
reluctant to criticize Shultz's decision to reverse the ban on talks
with the PLO because of his traditionally staunch support for Israel.
   The perception is further highlighted because it contrasts
sharply with American Jews' traditional support for the Democratic
Party. Jews voted 2-to-1 in favor of Michael Dukakis over Bush in
the November elections.
   Especially disturbing to AIPAC supporters in Congress was its
reaction to the administration's request last summer for 40 F-18 jet
fighters worth $1.8 billion for Kuwait. AIPAC, following Israel's
lead, contended that the sale to the moderate Arab nation did not
threaten Israeli security.
   Smith, who led the fight against the sale and counted on AIPAC's
backing, was angry. ``They lost sight of the fact that in the long
run this will be harmful to Israel and America,'' he said. ``There's
a legitimate debate about whether we're selling weapons to the Arabs
as a bribe or whether we have a coherent policy toward them.''
   Morris Amitay, a Washington lawyer who was AIPAC's executive
director from 1974 to 1980, cautioned the lobby's leadership about
bypassing Congress and trying to influence the administration
directly. ``It's not very sophisticated of them,'' he said. ``Anyone
who knows how this city works knows it's wrong.''
   AIPAC leaders declined to be interviewed, saying the
organization's low profile is essential for its behind-the-scenes
effectiveness.
   But privately officials said the organization wasn't moving away
from Congress, noting that it is adding one congressional lobbyist
to its list of five.
   They also denied any Republican leanings, noting that some of
their senior board members are known Democrats.

   Former Rep. James V. Stanton of Ohio became the
fifth Democrat to enter the race for national party chairman on
Tuesday, saying he represents none of the party's factions and could
unify it for the 1992 presidential campaign.
   Stanton, now a Washington lawyer, entered the race acknowledging
he trails some of the other candidates.
   ``I believe I can revitalize the party structure and bring all
Democrats under the same roof,'' he said at a news conference. ``I
am uniquely qualified to do this because I am not the candidate of
the South or the candidate of the Northeast, or the candidate of the
right or the left.''
   The nearly 400 voting members of the Democratic National
Committee will select a new national chairman when they meet in
Washington Feb. 9-10.
   Already in the race are Ron Brown, a former aide to Jesse
Jackson; Richard Wiener, Michigan state party chairman; former Rep.
James Jones of Oklahoma, the former chairman of the House Budget
Committee, and former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland.
   Stanton has the backing of former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill
of Massachusetts, although O'Neill does not have a vote on the
committee. He is backed by his state's two Democratic senators, John
Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum, but his Ohio party leaders have
endorsed Wiener.
   Stanton said he expected to compete with Brown for organized
labor's votes on the committee, and he called Wiener ``obviously the
insider'' in the race.
   He said he would concentrate on party building and fund raising
as chairman. He dismissed Jones' proposals for building a permanent
staff of campaign professionals to be folded into the eventual
presidential nominee's campaign, and said he had no plans for
changing delegate selection rules.
   ``There are many people who want to tinker with the machinery of
the Democratic Party. I'm not one of them,'' he said.
   Stanton is a former Cleveland city council president who served
three terms in the House before losing the 1976 Democratic Senate
primary to Metzenbaum.

<HEAD>Princess Beatrice Gives Short Cry At Baptism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice was bapitized Tuesday by the
archbishop of York with water from the Jordan River, and she let out
just one quick cry as her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York,
watched in delight.
   The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of Britain's royal
family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the
archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made
her a member of the Church of England.
   Queen Elizabeth II, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head
of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at St. James'
Palace after the christening to pose briefly for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and
matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on Aug. 8, 1988, at 8:18
p.m., considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers.
   Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn
woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the
``blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of ``poisoned
glut'' and ``poisoned seas.''
   The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, Prince
Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of
duty in the Far East.
   Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev.
John Habgood, Archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the
church rather than Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the
church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of
``personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York
title.
   The Chapel Royal, the main surviving part of the Tudor Palace
built by Henry VIII, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married in the chapel in 1840
and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there.
   The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the
parents, ``Jesus, Good Above All Other,'' ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, ``Away In A Manger.''
   The choir also sang ``Princess Beatrice's Anthem,'' composed by
Richard Popplewell, organist and choir master of the queen's Chapels
Royal, with words by the late Lord Gorell, a literary magazine
editor.
   Beatrice was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of
flowing cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen Victoria's eldest
son in 1842.
   She was baptized at the silver gilt Lily Font, made for the
christening in 1840 of Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria's eldest
child, and used to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children.
   Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, Beatrice's five were
reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil
and to follow Christ.
   Her godparents are Viscount Linley, son of the queen's sister
Princess Margaret; property developer Peter Palumbo, who is chairman
of the Arts Council; Mrs. Harry Cotterell, who formerly shared an
apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of Roxburghe, at whose
Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah Ferguson; and Mrs.
John Greenall, a friend of the duchess.
   Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, his wife, Princess Diana and
their two children, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4. Queen
Mother Elizabeth, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also
there.
   After the ceremony, the guests went to Buckingham Palace for a
tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the
palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took
the official family photographs of the christening party.

<HEAD>Former Ohio Congressman Named to Deficit Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Thomas L. Ashley, selected by
George Bush on Tuesday for the high-level commission studying the
deficit problem, is a Democrat who has been friends with the
president-elect since they were classmates at Yale long ago.
   Ashley, 65, was a Democratic congressman from Toledo for 26 years
before his defeat in Ronald Reagan's 1980 landslide.
   Ashley, whose nickname is ``Lud'' from his middle name of Ludlow,
is now president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, a
lobbying group which represents the country's largest banks.
   He is considered one of Bush's oldest and closest friends. At
Yale, they were members of the secret society, Skull and Bones.
Asked once to describe his friend, Ashley said, ``He has spent a
lifetime thinking in conventional terms, never reaching beyond them,
never even wanting to.''
   In announcing Ashley's appointment to the National Economic
Commission on Tuesday, Bush said he expected to benefit from
Ashley's ``counsel and his candor'' on the commission.
   ``I have had the privilege of knowing Lud Ashley for over 40
years,'' Bush said in a statement. ``He understands the full range
of national issues _ from housing, to energy, to the problems of our
cities.''
   Bush's decision to put his long-time friend on the panel gave
supporters of the commssion hope that Bush may take its
recommendations more seriously. During the campaign, Bush derided
the commission as a stalking horse for tax increases.
   Ashley, considered a liberal Democrat while in Congress, served
as ranking member of the House Banking Committee and was also
considered an expert on energy problems.
   Like Bush, Ashley fought in the Pacific during World War II and
then entered Yale to resume his education. He received his
undergraduate degree in 1948 and then earned a law degree by
attending night classes at the University of Toledo law school.
   He practiced law with his father and brother in Toledo before
joining the staff of Radio Free Europe in 1952, where he served as
assistant director for special projects for two years.
   He was elected to Congress in 1954, serving in the House where
his great-grandfather, James M. Ashley, had served during the Civil
War. The great-grandfather had also been governor of Montana when
the area was a territory.

<HEAD>China Says It Will Stop Aid To Insurgents If Vietnam Withdraws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Tuesday announced it would stop aiding
the Khmer Rouge and other Cambodian resistance forces as soon as
Vietnam withdraws its troops from Cambodia.
   The statement, which appeared in the People's Daily, was a
further indication that Beijing's policy toward Vietnam's occupation
of Cambodia has softened.
   China's premier, Li Peng, made the statement at a news conference
Monday with journalists from China and India covering Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's visit.
   According to the report, Li said ``if Vietnam withdraws from
Cambodia, all parties, including China, should stop aiding elements
in Cambodia.''
   In addition, Li said, ``in order to calm the fears of the
international community, as Vietnam withdraws, we will decrease our
military assistance to the resistance forces.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and unseated the Khmer
Rouge, who had ruled the country from 1975. More than a million
people are believed to have died during their bloody reign.
   China, the capitalist countries of Southeast Asia and the West
support a three-party resitance coalition comprised of forces loyal
to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge and Son Sann, a
Western-leanding politician.
   Vietnam has said it will leave Cambodia by 1990 and will turn the
war over to the government of Heng Samrin, which it installed in
Phnom Penh in 1979.
   But the Cambodian forces are weak and there are widespread fears
the Khmer Rouge will return to power after Hanoi pulls out its
forces.
   On Monday, Vietnam announced another troop withdrawal. The troops
were among the 50,000 Vietnam says are being sent home this year in
its seventh annual partial pullout. Vietnam says the current
withdrawal will leave 50,000 troops in Cambodia.
   China's position on Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia has been
evolving over the last few months as its relationship with Vietnam's
main backer, the Soviet Union, improves.
   Initially, China demanded Vietnam withdraw completely from
Cambodia before China would even consider ceasing military aid. It
also had expressed close support of the Khmer Rouge.
   Over the summer, China moved noticeably away from the Khmer Rouge
and began backing a Cambodian government headed by Sihanouk.
   In November, Li said once the Vietnamese produced a timetable for
the withdrawal, ``then the military assistance to all the four
parties in Cambodia must and also can be graduwlly reduced and even
totally stopped.''
   Tuesday's announcement marked a further revising of the Chinese
position because it dropped the demand for a timetable.

<HEAD>US Skeptical on Vietnam's Withdrawal Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed skepticism
Tuesday that Vietnam will fulfill its pledge to withdraw 50,000
troops from Cambodia before the end of the year.
   Vietnam contends that its commitment is being met with the
withdrawal of 18,000 troops this week.
   But State Department officials insisted that even if the
Vietnamese estimate of the size of the ongoing pullback is accurate,
it would only bring the total for the year to between 28,000 and
33,000 troops.
   While welcoming this week's troop withdrawal, State Department
deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said, ``We remain skeptical that
the 50,000 pledge will be met.'' She estimated the current
Vietnamese troop commitment to Cambodia at between 90,000 and
100,000, down from about 120,000 at the start of the year.
   ``Since we believe Vietnam's illegal occupation is the root cause
of the conflict, we continue to urge Hanoi to issue a precise
timetable for the withdrawal of its remaining troops from Cambodia
during 1989 and to allow for the verification of their withdrawal,''
she said.
   Vietnam has indicated all its troops in Cambodia will be
withdrawn by 1990.
   Mrs. Oakley said once all Vietnamese forces are withdrawn and
there is an acceptable political settlement in Cambodia, the United
States would be prepared to normalize relations with Hanoi.
   Some previous administration statements had conditioned the
establishment of normal ties with Vietnam on Hanoi's cooperation in
accounting for the estimated 1,700 American servicemen listed as
missing from the Vietnam War, but there was no such link included in
Mrs. Oakley's statement Tuesday.
   A State Department official said Tuesday the MIA issue was being
dealt with separately, and he cited statements by President Reagan
and other senior officials suggesting there was no explicit link
between the MIA issue and normal relations with Vietnam.
   But last July, Secretary of State George P. Shultz linked
diplomatic ties with Hanoi both to a Cambodian settlement and to ``a
resolution of the POW-MIA issue which, if left unsettled, will
continue to divide our peoples.''
   Asked whether the POW-MIA condition had been dropped, Mrs. Oakley
said, ``We have been stressing that it is the complete withdrawal of
all Vietnamese forces in the context of an acceptable settlement in
Cambodia which will be the determining factor.''
   Cambodia's political future following the Vietnamese withdrawal
is highly uncertain. The pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh has been
fighting against three rebel groups, two of which are backed by the
United States. The third is the Khmer Rouge, which is widely accused
of having engaged in mass genocide when it ruled Cambodia between
1975 and 1978.
   An alternate approach to U.S. relations with Vietnam was outlined
in a report released Tuesday by the Aspen Institute, a private
research group.
   The report recommended the United States take ``graduated''
diplomatic steps toward Vietnam if its troops are withdrawn from
Cambodia prior to a Cambodia settlement.
   These steps should include the establishment of small diplomatic
missions in each other's capital and adjustments in the U.S. trade
embargo against Vietnam, the report said.
   Vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the United
States does not maintain diplomatic relations.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha on Tuesday
fired the lone non-white member of his Cabinet following completion
of an inquiry into corruption in the Indian chamber of Parliament.
   Amichand Rajbansi was ousted by Botha from his seat on the
Cabinet, where he served without a portfolio, and also from his post
as leader of the House of Delegates.
   The only other non-white ever to serve on the Cabinet, the Rev.
Allan Hendrickse, was forced to resign last year after a dispute
with Botha over the future of residential segregation laws.
Hendrickse is leader of the mixed-race house of Parliament, which is
dominated by the white chamber and excludes the country's black
majority.
   Rajbansi's ouster came a week after Botha received the official
report on a two-month inquiry into alleged irregularities and
corruption in the House of Delegates. Rajbansi had been suspended
from the Cabinet pending the outcome of the hearings, which were
conducted in Durban by a former Supreme Court judge.
   The report has not been made public, and it is not known whether
any criminal charges might be filed as a result of the investigation.
   Botha did not specify his reasons for firing Rajbansi, saying
merely that the action was taken ``in view of the findings'' of the
inquiry commission.
   Among the allegations made during the inquiry were that contracts
for providing school textbooks went to booksellers who donated money
to Rajbansi's party, that Rajbansi was involved in improper
allocations of business permits, and that he improperly interfered
in civil service appointments.
   Rajbansi, 46, became a fulltime politician in 1980. He worked
previously as a sports administrator, soccer referee, teacher, and
spokesman for the dairy industry.
   He was elected to Parliament in 1984 from a district near Durban
after adoption of a new constitution which created the Indian and
mixed-race parliamentary chambers. Anti-apartheid activists of all
races opposed the constitution because it excluded blacks, and there
was a widespread boycott of the elections.

   About 120 people stormed the parliament
building Tuesday during a hearing on a 1980 civil uprising that was
put down by the military, and they demanded the truth be told about
the bloody incident.
   The protesters, identifying themselves as relatives of victims of
the uprising, clashed with scores of guards in the National Assembly
building as they tried to enter the hearing room.
   The uprising in the southern city of Kwangju was the worst in
modern South Korean history. By official count, about 200 people
were killed and more than 800 others injured or wounded when the
army moved in.
   The opposition charges the incident was set up as part of a plot
by army generals to seize power in the chaotic days that followed
the assassination of the late president Park Chung-hee in late 1979.
   ``Reveal the truth of Kwangju,'' the protesters shouted today as
they moved up and down a corridor of the assembly building, breaking
two porcelain decorations. Opposition lawmakers persuaded the
protesters into a room, where they staged a sit-down for four hours.
   After the sit-down, the protesters drove in three buses to the
presidential mansion, but were stopped 700 yards away. Police took
them to nearby police stations.
   Chun Kye-ryang, a spokesman for the group, told police the group
was protesting what he called a lackluster effort by the assembly to
get at the facts of the Kwangju incident.
   Chun rejected a government offer of financial compensation before
all the facts of the incident are fully divulged. He demanded that
he and other protesters be allowed to testify at the hearing.

   Three officials were charged Tuesday with
the murder of a suspected poacher in a wildlife sanctuary, attorneys
said.
   The three were arrested by police investigating the Nov. 10
shooting death of a Zimbabwean near Makuti, about 225 miles
northwest of Harare.
   Glenn Tatham, chief warden in the state-run Department of
National Parks; senior warden Steve Edwards; and Chief Inspector
Charles Haley, a police ballistics expert, pleaded innocent and were
released on about $16,600 bail each.
   Members of a ranger unit commanded by Tatham opened fire on two
suspected poachers, killing the one who appeared to be raising his
rifle, said defense attorneys, speaking on condition of anonymity.
They said rhinoceros horn was found at the scene of the shooting.
   Since 1984, more than 400 black rhinoceroses have been killed by
poachers and rangers have killed more than 47 alleged poachers. A
rhino horn can fetch up to $25,000 on the black market.

<HEAD>Drought-Reduced Grain Stockpiles Likely To Grow in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The searing 1988 drought cut deeply into U.S.
and global grain stockpiles, but the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday that normal weather could improve things significantly by
this time next year.
   Drought in the United States and Canada lowered world crop
production by more than 6 percent, the department's Economic
Research Service said.
   ``Crop prices will continue to reflect these smaller supplies
early in 1989,'' the agency said in a new outlook report. ``But
expanded output is likely in the second half, stopping the drawdown
in stocks.''
   Meanwhile, world supplies of animal products will remain large
enough to dampen increases in livestock prices. However, the demand
for both crop and animal products is expected to be bolstered by
continued world economic expansion and population growth.
   The agency stuck to an earlier estimate that the net cash income
of U.S. farmers in 1989 is likely to be in the range of $48 billion
to $52 billion, down from this year's record-tying estimate of $57
billion.
   ``Firm prices for most commodities and larger production will
mean total farm receipts slightly above the 1988 record,'' the
report said. ``Cash expenses are expected to rise moderately with
expanded acreage and costlier inputs (production items). Direct
government payments to farmers are likely to fall one-fifth.''
   As used by the agency, net cash income is the amount of money
farmers have to spend during a calendar year and is the difference
between gross cash income and cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales
of grain stored from harvests in earlier years are counted as part
of the current gross.
   In another method of bookkeeping, the agency measures ``net farm
income'' for the year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system
involved in ``net cash income.''
   This method includes changes in the value of farm inventories,
and allowances are made for ``non-money'' items such as
depreciation, the family consumption of farm-grown food and the net
rental value of dwellings.
   Net farm income for 1989 is forecast at $44 billion to $48
billion, compared with the estimate of $39 billion this year.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery under a recently
extended supply agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   It was the second consecutive day of large corn sales to the
Soviets, with 750,000 tons announced on Monday.
   However, the department also announced the cancellation of
200,000 tons of soybean meal that had been scheduled for delivery to
the Soviets in 1988-89. No explanation was given, but officials say
conflicts in shipping schedules or price disagreements have been
behind such cancellations in the past.
   The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets to more
than 7.03 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began
Oct. 1. Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled
slightly less than 5.2 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of
corn would be about 29.5 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.58 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning the latest sale
could have a farm value of around $76 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
635,000 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain annually, including a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn.
   The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as
two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.

   Corporations reported a 3.9 percent rise in
after-tax profits for the third quarter, down from an 8.9 percent
surge in the previous quarter but substantially above the
preliminary estimate last month, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said profits rose $6.4 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual level of $169.1 billion for the third
quarter. That's much better than the slight 0.2 percent rise
reported a month ago, but the department noted that almost all of
the improvement came from profits earned by overseas subsidiaries of
U.S. companies.
   The second quarter rise in profits had been the best in nearly
five years.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said the
domestic operations of many companies are being caught in a profit
squeeze. They are paying higher wages and higher interest rates, but
have been unable to pass on price increases to consumers because of
stiff competition both in the United States and from overseas.
   ``We're going to see some pressure on prices because profits are
becoming harder to earn, but companies are probably limited by
competitive pressures. ... It will be hard for companies to reverse
the kind of profit squeeze we're starting to see,'' he said.
   Corporate profits before taxes rose 2.6 percent in the third
quarter to $313.9 billion, following a 6.9 percent increase in the
previous three-month period.
   Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.5 percent to $105.7
billion in the third quarter, up from a 1.8 percent gain in the
second quarter.
   Corporate cash flows, a measure intended to show the funds
corporations have available for investment, rose 0.8 percent in the
third quarter, following a 1.4 percent rise in the April-June period.
   Investment spending by manufacturing companies enjoying a boom in
export sales has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
economy. Reduced growth in corporate cash flows could eventually cut
into capital spending expansion.

   The number of Americans behind in their
mortgage payments fell in the July-September quarter to the lowest
levels in a year, an organization of lenders said Tuesday.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said 4.73 percent of
the payments on the 10.8 million mortgages surveyed in the third
quarter were at least 30 days late.
   It was the lowest rate since the third quarter of 1987, when 4.71
percent of the mortgage payers were behind. The rate a year ago was
the lowest in eight years. In the second quarter, the delinquency
rate was 4.90 percent.
   The foreclosure rate edged down to 0.26 percent in the third
quarter, compared with 0.27 percent in the second quarter.
   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association, said
he was ``very heartened'' by the decline, but the report noted a
mixed pattern regionally.
   In North Central states, the delinquency rate was 4.88 percent,
down from 5.30 percent a year ago. The rate in the Northeast was
unchanged from a year ago at 4.12 percent, the lowest of four
regions.
   However, the rate in the South rose from 5.25 percent last year
to 5.29 percent. The rate in the West was 4.28 percent in the third
quarter, up from 4.10 percent a year ago.
   A high employment level in the United States generally has helped
keep delinquencies low. The South has had a relatively high rate
because Texas and other Southwestern states are struggling with a
depressed oil industry.
   Two offsetting trends will affect delinquencies next year.
Interest rates are rising, increasing the monthly payments on
adjustable-rate mortgages. However, the economy is expected to
remain strong, at least through mid-year, keeping the unemployment
rate low.

<HEAD>Army Instructors Disciplined For Socializing With Female Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven instructors at Fort Benning's
airborne school were fined and demoted for socializing with students
at the base in violation of the Army's fraternization policy.
   Lt. Col. Mark Lewis, battalion commander, said several female
students alleged that they had sex with instructors, but Lewis only
found evidence that instructors were dating students and of
``improper senior-subordinate relationships.''
   Airborne instructors in three of the four companies in the 1st
Battalion of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment have been or are
being investigated for socializing, dating or sexually harassing
female airborne students, post officials told the Columbus
Ledger-Enquirer.
   Seven were punished, appealed and had their appeals denied. All
were demoted in rank and fined the equivalent of one month's pay.
The demotions of four were suspended for six months, which means
their ranks will be restored if no further infractions are charged
against them during that time.
   The students were not punished, Lewis said, because he wanted
them to continue to give information about the instructors' conduct.
   They also were not punished, he said, because instructors are in
supervisory positions and know the fraternization policy, but
students _ even though they are given briefings on it _ are not as
familiar with the policy.
   The investigations began when a student was questioned about an
unrelated incident and told brigade officers that instructors were
dating students, a violation of the Army's fraternization policy.
   The instructors are non-commissioned officers who teach and
supervise students in a three-week airborne course. The course is
one of the few at the post with students of both sexes.
   Col. Kenneth Teel, the School Brigade commander, said the
incidents were not that significant considering 25,000 students go
through the course each year. The School Brigade oversees the
airborne school.
   ``I'm really rather surprised we don't get more (sexual
harassment) allegations than we do,'' he said. ``The investigation
found that it was not very widespread at all.''
   In an attempt to help solve the problem, Teel has hired a female
instructor and is asking for other qualified women to volunteer for
instructors' positions.

<HEAD>Premier Ryzhkov Attacks Nationalists, Calls for Compromise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Tuesday asked for
compromise in the ethnic dispute between the republics of Armenia
and Azerbaijan and accused nationalists of using Armenia's
devastating earthquake to sow strife in the region.
   In a report that kept up a media attack on activists on both
sides of the ethnic dispute, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
said officials arrested nine people on suspicion of inciting unrest
in Azerbaijan.
   Ryzhkov met with members of Armenian artists' unions in the
capital Yerevan before returning to Moscow. He had been in Armenia
almost two weeks to oversee relief efforts following the Dec. 7
earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people and left more than
500,000 people homeless.
   The quake came after three weeks of unrest between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis in which at least 31 people were killed and more than
180,000 fled to escape the violence.
   The official Tass news agency said Ryzhkov attacked
``adventurists who jointly with corrupt and hooligan elements hamper
the effort to overcome the aftermath of the natural disaster even
when the resources of the people are taxed to the utmost, try to sow
ethnic strife, provoke illegal actions, and in the long run,
undermine the spiritual health of the nation.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials have expressed
frustration that the earthquake has not eased strains between the
two southern Soviet republics.
   Armenia wants to annex the predominantly Armenian region of
Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and central authorities
have rejected annexation.
   Ryzhkov and the Armenian Communist Party leader, Suren Arutunyan,
called for a compromise solution. They spoke at a televised news
conference.
   Ryzhkov said a Kremlin directive in July rejecting Armenia's
annexation demand had not solved the problem.
   Gorbachev gathered Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders in Moscow
following a session of the Supreme Soviet parliament at the end of
last month. On the basis of that meeting, Arutunyan said, local
officials were working to meet a deadline for a compromise solution
within 12 days. However, he said the earthquake interrupted the work
on the seventh day.
   In a report from Kirovabad, Azerbaijan, where some of the worst
ethnic violence took place last month, Pravda said three Armenians _
I. Muradyan, B. Sisyan, and F. Gulgazaryan _ were held for
investigation for allegedly inciting ethnic unrest among Armenians
living in Azerbaijan.
   It said the three flew to the Kirovabad region several times in a
helicopter to organize meetings. Pravda said a fourth person, former
Soviet Interior Ministry worker L.G. Mirzoyan, was arrested for
interference in agricultural work.
   The report said in a report from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku,
that five people were arrested on suspicion of taking bribes
totaling about $160,000.
   It accused the five, workers in the Ministry of Auto Transport,
of helping organize unsanctioned meetings and demonstrations and of
causing Armenians, Russians and Jews to be fired from their jobs.
   It identified the five by the last names of Ibragimov, Aslanov,
Yusufov, Nabizade, and Ismailov.

<HEAD>FEMA Approves Emergency Evacuation Plans for Seabrook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials on Tuesday approved
evacuation plans for Massachusetts communities near the Seabrook,
N.H., nuclear power plant despite Gov. Michael Dukakis' contention
that residents could not get away safely in an emergency.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which sends its findings
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to help the commissioners
determine whether to issue a commercial operating license, also
approved plans submitted by New Hampshire for its 17 municipalities
that fall within the reactor's 10-mile emergency zone.
   The conclusions could help Seabrook eventually receive a
full-power license, although plant officials still have not secured
a 5 percent power permit to test Seabrook's 1,150-megawatt reactor.
   The evacuation planning process for Seabrook has taken an
extraordinary course since Massachusetts, which has six towns within
the 10-mile zone, refused to submit emergency plans.
   Dukakis argued that it would be impossible to evacuate the
seacoast area safely, especially in the summer months when the
region's narrow roads are congested with beach traffic.
   Seabrook's chief owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire,
submitted plans on behalf of the Massachusetts municipalities last
year after the NRC voted to change its rule to allow the
utility-drafted plans in cases in which state and local officials
refuse to participate.
   The 1987 rules change, which was met with cries of foul from
lawmakers, Massachusetts officials, residents and anti-nuclear
advocates, was upheld in September by a federal appeals court in
Boston.
   FEMA officials reviewed the utility-drafted Massachusetts plans
under the NRC's guidelines, which include the ``realism doctrine.''
That agency policy assumes that state and local public safety
officials would follow the utility-drafted evacuation blueprints.
   Grant C. Peterson, associate director of FEMA's state and local
programs division, said in a letter accompanying the reports that
the Massachusetts plan ``will be adequate to protect the health and
safety'' of local residents after the company installs its emergency
alert system.
   That system consists of 16 siren-equipped vans, plus several
backup vans and a siren-equipped helicopter, that would alert
Massachusetts residents in case of an atomic emergency.
   Stationary sirens had been installed in the Massachusetts
communities, but Seabrook officials were forced to take them down by
state and local opponents, who won their case in court.
   Meanwhile, the NRC prepared to vote Wednesday on the final
regulatory obstacles that have blocked Seabrook's low-power testing
license.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon has said he will
move immediately to block the license in federal court.
   Both remaining issues surrounding the low-power permit involve
the financial stability of Seabrook's owners.
   Public Service filed for bankruptcy protection reorganization in
January. And in June, the fourth-largest shareholder, Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., withdrew from the project and
halted its $2 million-a-month payments.

   A police official testified Tuesday that
officers on the scene, not the governor, decided that 14 black
lawmakers would be arrested during a demonstration against the
Confederate battle flag atop the state Capitol.
   Testimony in the oft-delayed trial of Alabama NAACP President
Thomas Reed and 13 co-defendants ended Tuesday, but the judge
hearing the case said he would not issue a verdict immediately.
   Reed, then a member of the state House of Representatives, and 13
other black lawmakers were arrested during their protest Feb. 2 and
charged with trespassing. They say the Dixie battle flag atop the
Capitol is a symbol of racial oppression.
   Reed was arrested after he grabbed the fence around the Capitol
building, which is closed for renovation, and attempted to climb it.
The other 13 defendants followed suit, with many simply placing
their hands on the links in a symbolic protest.
   The only witness to testify Tuesday, Capitol Police Chief Cecil
Humphrey, said it was left to him and state troopers to determine
whether a violation of the law occurred. He said he had discussed
security arrangements for the protest in advance with Gov. Guy
Hunt's staff, but that the governor was not at the scene and did not
directly order the arrests.
   The defense rested after Humphrey testified. None of the
defendants took the stand.
   District Judge Craig Miller, presiding over the non-jury case,
said he would not issue a verdict until after reading written
testimony by Hunt, who was questioned by defense attorneys in his
office Monday.
   The dispute over whether Hunt would testify in person had been
one reason the trial dragged on over seven weeks even though only
eight hours of testimony was actually heard, spread over three days.
   Courtroom action came to a halt in mid-November when the defense
called Hunt as its first witness. Attorneys for the governor argued
he should not have to appear, and the judge eventually agreed with
them and let the governor testify by giving a deposition in his
office .
   That delay was only one of several in the trial, which first had
been set to begin March 11.
   Reed was removed from his seat in the Alabama House last month
after being sentenced to four years in federal prison on an
unrelated extortion conviction.
   All 14 legislators were charged with second-degree trespassing,
which carries a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment and a
$500 fine upon conviction.
   The defendants claim they were protected by legislative immunity
during the protest and that no trespass on state property occurred
since they never got over the fence. The prosecution contended
trespassing occurred when their hands gripped the fence.

<HEAD>Court Orders New Inquest into IRA Shootings; Journalists Challenge
IRA Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Ireland's highest court
on Tuesday ordered a new inquest into the deaths of three unarmed
guerrillas, refueling the controversy over whether police shoot IRA
suspects on sight.
   The Court of Appeals also overturned rulings by a coroner and a
lower court, announcing that three policemen who fired the fatal
shots at the disputed 1982 ambush can be compelled to testify.
   The High Court had upheld coroner James Elliott's ruling that the
officers could not be forced to give evidence.
   But Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Hutton said, ``The fact that
they are suspected of causing the deaths of the three deceased is
not a reason in law why they should not be compelled to go into the
witness box.''
   But he added that the unidentified lawmen can refuse to give
self-incriminating testimony. The policemen already have been
acquitted of murdering one of the members of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   They were among five officers who ambushed IRA members Gervase
McKerr, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns. The three allegedly failed to
stop their car at a police checkpoint in County Armagh.
   The original inquest was adjourned in late November while Eleanor
McKerr, widow of Gervase McKerr, fought to have the courts order the
policemen to testify and be cross-examined rather than submit
written statements.
   The original inquest has been scrapped.
   Inquests still are pending into the deaths of three more unarmed
Roman Catholics _ two guerrillas and a civilian teen-ager _ who died
in two police ambushes in the same region.
   Police said the deaths, which occurred over a three-week period,
came in the normal course of anti-terrorist activity. But subsequent
evidence suggested the killings were deliberate and avoidable.
   They have opened a fresh chapter in a 6-year-old controversy over
whether police conduct illegal campaigns to shoot IRA suspects on
sight instead of arresting them.
   The Roman Catholic IRA is trying to oust British rule from
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic.
   In a separate development, six British journalists announced a
court challenge to the government's Oct. 18 ban on radio and
television interviews with members of the IRA, its legal political
wing Sinn Fein, and its sympathizers.
   Financed by the National Union of Journalists, their High Court
appeal argues the order is illegal, contravenes the European
Convention of Human Rights and conflicts with the principle of
editorial independence.
   The measure aimed at silencing IRA propaganda applies to radio
and TV interviews with the publicly funded British Broadcasting
Corp. and independent commercial networks, but not to newspapers or
foreign media.

<TEXT>
   The government announced Tuesday it has picked a
domestic company over a U.S. firm to develop a new generation of
battle tanks for the British army.
   But Officials said the new British tank would be required to meet
stringent standards over a 21-month development period. If it fails,
they reserved the right to choose the U.S. model or even a West
German tank.
   Announcing the decision in Parliament, Defense Secretary George
Younger said the government would give the British company, Vickers
PLC, a $164 million grant to develop prototypes of its Challenger 2
Mark II tank by September 1990.
   In the final weeks, the choice appeared to have narrowed to the
Challenger and the Abrams M1-A1, a tank made by the U.S.-based
General Dynamics Corp. The U.S. military has used the Abrams M1-A1
for years.
   British government officials said they would stay in contact with
the foreign companies in case the domestic tank fell short of
expectations.
   ``They (Vickers) will have to hit these (development) targets and
hit them well and proper if we are to proceed,'' Younger told
Parliament.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government agonized over the
decision, fearful of repeating the fiasco that ended in 1986 when it
wrote off a dud British spy plane called the Nimrod. The Nimrod cost
nearly $2 billion, but the government instead purchased the Airborne
Warning and Control System planes from the Seattle-based Boeing Co.
   The final contract for the new piece of hardware will call for
about 500 tanks to replace aging Chieftain tanks. The contract will
be worth about $2.5 billion.
   Vickers Chairman David Plastow discounted any similarities
between the new tank and the Nimrod. ``There is no real parallel
with Nimrod, no new state of the art hardware is involved,'' he said.
   General Dynamics Land Systems Division, based in Sterling
Heights, Mich., said it was disappointed but would wait on the
sidelines in case the British tank falters.
   ``Should their development efforts not meet those standards, we
would be prepared to re-enter discussions with British officials
concerning purchase of the Abrams tank to meet their NATO
requirements,'' company officials said in a statement read Tuesday
by spokesman Karl Oskoian.
   Younger denied published reports that British army chiefs had
pushed for the Abrams M1-A1: ``While it is nice to feel that the
best possible tank will be British, it is not the driving force.''
   Plastow had argued if the British government turned down its
model, no other country would buy it. He said potential export
orders to Saudi Arabia and other Middle and Far East countries
totaling about $22 billion would be lost.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul D. Laxalt, named by President-elect Bush
to the commission looking for a solution to the deficit, is a
longtime confidant of President Reagan and one whose own
presidential hopes fell short for want of money.
   Laxalt retired from the U.S. Senate in 1986, giving up a likely
safe seat from Nevada. But more than a senator, he was a close
friend and ally of the president, a man Laxalt described as like a
brother. Their friendship dates to their days as governors of their
adjoining states.
   Laxalt was also general chairman of the Republican National
Committee and managed three Reagan presidential campaigns.
   After giving up his Senate seat, Laxalt sought to become heir to
Reagan's conservative legacy and win the presidential nomination.
   But he found the going difficult, and he ended his presidential
bid in mid-1987, more than a year before the election. He said it
was the lack of money _ he had raised about $1 million, while Bush
was over the $9 million mark at that point.
   ``Washington is a fast-moving town,'' he once remarked. ``You are
a memory very quickly.''
   His appointment by Bush may move him back into the spotlight a
bit.
   Bush named Laxalt and a Democrat, former Ohio Rep. Thomas L.
Ashley, as his representatives on the 14-member National Economic
Commission.
   The bipartisan commission is to recommend ways to close the
federal budget deficit to Bush, whose ``read my lips'' campaign vow
of no tax increases would seem to foreclose one option before the
panel. The panel was created by Congress last year after the stock
market plunge.
   Laxalt is the son of a Basque immigrant sheepherder, and still
enjoys spending time at his family's remote, 120-acre camp in the
Sierra Nevadas east of Lake Tahoe.
   He ran a casino in Carson City, Nev., where he grew up and served
as governor. More recently, Laxalt was embroiled in a $250 million
libel suit against McClatchy Newspapers, over a story that said the
Internal Revenue Service had evidence of skimming at his family's
casino. Both sides claimed victory in the suit's dismissal.
   He held no official position in the Senate leadership, no
committee chairmanship, and he rarely debated issues on the Senate
floor. Yet he had a hand in virtually every major decision of the
first six years of the Reagan presidency, his power deriving from
his closeness to the president.

   Immigration Commissioner Alan Nelson has asked
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to wipe out a Justice Department
unit that has supported Central Americans and others seeking asylum
in the United States, an internal memo shows.
   At issue is the Asylum Policy and Review Unit, which has prodded
the department to override a number of Immigration and
Naturalization Service denials of asylum.
   One point ``we would like to raise with you is the validity of
the Asylum Policy and Review Unit,'' said Nelson's Dec. 13 memo to
Thornburgh, which was obtained by The Associated Press. ``APRU has
cost INS appropriations $750,000 since inception. ... The entire
purpose of APRU and its continued existence should now be reviewed
by your staff.''
   APRU reviews of asylum rejections by INS are ``just plain
financially wasteful,'' said the memo. APRU has persuaded INS to
reconsider denials in 35 cases and has referred another 35 cases to
Justice Department officials who then directed reversals, said
department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   APRU was established in 1987 to monitor INS asylum operations
following a 1985 incident in which a Soviet seaman who jumped ship
on the Mississippi River was returned to his Soviet vessel on orders
of the U.S. Border Patrol. The border patrol is part of INS.
   ``The establishment of the Justice Department unit was a positive
development in that it recognized that INS was incapable of handling
the asylum function,'' Arthur Helton, an attorney for the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, said Tuesday. His group favors removing
INS from the asylum process altogether.
   ``This office serves a vital purpose'' and its staff is dedicated
to ensuring that ``the purposes of United States asylum policy are
carried out,'' said Henry Curry, the unit's director, who declined
to respond directly to Nelson's memo.
   Nelson is urging the change in connection with proposed
regulations, first discussed three years ago, which would implement
the Refugee Act of 1980. That law established the standard of
granting U.S. haven to refugees with a well-founded fear of
persecution in their homelands.
   The proposed regulations are finally being shaped at a time when
Nicaraguans and other Central Americans are pouring across the
border illegally and then seeking asylum, saying they have been
persecuted in their home country.
   Nelson's memo asks Thornburgh to review the regulatory proposals
and to issue a final regulation by the end of the year. Thornburgh
is in Europe until later this week and has not yet conducted
discussions on the proposed regulations.
   INS spokesman Greg Leo declined to comment on the memo, saying
that ``we don't want to set a precedent'' in which ``each memo gets
publicly discussed before it gets decided.''
   Last week, the AP obtained internal INS documents outlining a
program under which Nicaraguans and other Central Americans seeking
asylum would no longer be granted work permits while their
applications are pending. INS is assigning additional personnel to
handle the applications in an attempt to shorten the decision time
on the applications to 30 days or less, a process which could
ultimately result in deportations for those whose claims are
rejected.
   Nelson's memo also asked Thornburgh to modify a regulatory
proposal that would set up a centralized system of skilled officers
who consider asylum applications and who would receive training from
APRU.
   The commissioner instead wants the asylum officers placed under
the control of district immigration directors around the country.
   Under that decentralized approach, INS examiners last year
granted asylum requests from 110 Salvadorans and rejected 3,822
other Salvadoran requests for asylum; granted asylum requests from
2,786 Nicaraguans and denied 2,455 others; and granted requests from
24 Guatamalans while denying 447 others.
   ``Asylum applications have almost tripled in the past year due
primarily to the more permissive approach to work authorization,''
said Nelson's memo. ``We need to take the necessary steps to prevent
the existing situation and avoid the proliferation of this
situation.''
   Nelson was referring to a July 1987 statement by then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese III which directed INS to encourage applications
for work authorizations from Nicaraguans seeking asylum.
   Some 60,700 people applied for asylum in fiscal 1988, up from
26,100 the previous year.

<HEAD>Defense Opens By Attacking Ms. Nussbaum</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Joel Steinberg, accused of murdering
his illegally adopted daughter, opened their defense Tuesday with an
assault on the credibility and character of Steinberg's chief
accuser and former live-in companion.
   Police Officer Thomas Andry testified he had found a woman who
looked just like Hedda Nussbaum drinking a beer and smoking in a
stranger's car while Lisa Steinberg, the 6-year-old girl the couple
raised, was unconscious in the family apartment nearby. He said he
was convinced it was, indeed, Ms. Nussbaum.
   In seven days of graphic testimony, Ms. Nussbaum testified that
she never left the house after Lisa fell unconscious, sometime
around 7 p.m. on Nov. 1, 1987. The prosecution maintains Lisa was
unconscious because Steinberg had struck her before going out to
dinner with a friend.
   ``The focus of this trial has shifted from Joel to Hedda,''
Steinberg's lawyer, Ira London, said outside the courtroom.
   He said there were unexplained bruises on Lisa's body, and
implied that the defense will suggest Ms. Nussbaum was responsible.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree
murder in the child's death. He denies that he hit the child, but
Ms. Nussbaum testified that he told her he had struck Lisa.
   Andry said that he found Ms. Nussbaum sitting, slumped down, in a
car near the couple's Greenwich Village apartment around 8:40 p.m.
on Nov. 1, 1987.
   He said he asked the woman if the car was hers. She said no, and
he told her to get out. She did.
   ``Her nose was distorted like it was messed up somehow. Her eyes
looked like they were dazed,'' he said.
   The officer's description of the woman fit the description of Ms.
Nussbaum, a former children's book author and editor, at the time of
her arrest Nov. 2, 1987. Charges against her were later dropped
after prosecutors concluded she was too severely battered by
Steinberg to have prevented Lisa's death.
   ``Is there any question as you sit here today that the woman you
saw sitting in the car on West 10th Street was Hedda Nussbaum?''
London asked.
   ``There's no question about it,'' the officer replied.
   Earlier in the day, the prosecution rested after presenting 39
witnesses since the trial began more than eight weeks ago.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax denied a defense
request to throw out all charges against Steinberg. He did say he
was inclined to drop one charge against Steinberg, endangering the
welfare of the 16-month-old boy police found in Steinberg's
apartment the morning they took the unconscious Lisa to a hospital.
   The boy was illegally adopted, just as Lisa was. He has since
been returned to his biological mother.
   Rothwax also said he would also instruct the jury to consider two
lesser homicide counts not included in the indictment against
Steinberg. They are second-degree manslaughter and criminally
negligent homicide.
   Steinberg is also charged with second-degree murder, first-degree
manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a minor with respect to
Lisa.
   The prosecution's last witness, Dr. Margaret McHugh, said Lisa
was a victim of child abuse. She based her opinion on medical and
autopsy reports and color photographs taken of the child.
   She said that findings of multiple bruises, the child's poor
hygiene and the brain hemorrhage Lisa suffered were consistent with
child abuse.

   About 300 people marched to the
presidential palace Tuesday, the anniversary of the world's worst
peacetime ship disaster, and declared a curse on the government and
the shipping line.
   Protesters burned two papier mache models of ships to commemorate
the Dec. 20, 1987, collision of the inter-island ferry Dona Paz and
the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island. More than 3,000 people
were killed.
   Two men slits the throats of two chickens and spattered the
models with blood.
   The marchers stopped and held their rally after police blocked
them at a bridge leading to President Corazon Aquino's office.
   ``In the name of all our loved ones, wherever they are, we swear
that all those responsible shall be made to pay for the deaths and
injustices they caused,'' members of the crowd chanted in unison.
``We will not lose hope until all those responsible are punished.''
   A presidential commission said at least 3,563 people were aboard
the two ships, but only 26 survived. Survivors and relatives say the
government and the Dona Paz's owners, Sulpicio Shipping Lines,
should provide more compensation to victims' families and take more
steps to prevent future maritime disasters.
   Tuesday's protesters lit candles to set fire to the papier mache
models. As the flames set off firecrackers inside the models,
hundreds wailed and began reciting a curse traditional among people
of the central Visayas islands, which was home to most of the
victims.
   ``We vow to be more active in the attainment of justice for our
loved ones and all other victims of oppression,'' the crowd recited.
   During the rally, one survivor of the disaster, Arnel Galang,
told the crowd the Sulpicio Lines had offered him money to testify
that the oil tanker was at fault in the collision, but he said he
refused.
   ``They think they can buy lives with their money,'' he said. He
also laid blame on ``this uncaring government.''
   Relatives of some victims say the government has tried to
pressure them into accepting compensation offered by the ship owners.
   Dolores Popes, who said she lost her mother and 11 other
relatives aboard the Dona Paz, said she did not receive any
financial assistance from the government. She said Sulpicio Lines
gave her $1,500.
   Nazzer Cajolo, who reported losing five brothers in the disaster,
said the shipping line offered a $7,500 settlement. He said his
family rejected it.
   Cajolo is one of about 300 people who have filed a class-action
lawsuit against Sulpicio Lines, the largest Philippine domestic
shipping company. The suit was rejected by a lower court, but an
appeal is pending.
   Sulpicio Lines suffered another blow last Oct. 24 when its
passenger ship Dona Marilyn, sank in Typhoon Ruby. About 300 people
were killed.

<TEXT>
   Bogus steam valve parts have been found at a
nuclear power plant in Michigan, marking the third type of
counterfeit equipment uncovered in the industry in the last two
years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was told Tuesday.
   The commission staff issued a special notice to nuclear utilities
last week asking them to be on the lookout for counterfeit valve
parts of all kinds, said Brian Grimes of the commission's Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
   Failure of the valves could not cause a nuclear accident, he said.
   Instances of counterfeit bolts and fasteners were found two years
ago. Earlier this year, counterfeit circuit breakers were found at
plants in Southern California.
   Industry-wide inspections, ordered by the NRC last month, turned
up a second type of bogus breaker, this one at the Commonwealth
Edison Co.'s Quad Cities plant in Illinois, Grimes said.
   He reported also that in late October, Consumers Power Co.
unwittingly bought a number of counterfeit valve parts for its
Palisades Plant at South Haven, Mich.
   Grimes said a failure of such parts could lead to an automatic
shutdown of the reactor.
   Consumers Power discovered the faulty parts when a repaired valve
leaked, Grimes said. ``Some of the parts they had procured turned
out to be misrepresented and counterfeit,'' and an investigation by
the manufacturer, Masoneilan-Dresser Co., concluded ``there appeared
to be a counterfeit market,'' he said.
   He said the NRC staff does not yet know how extensive the
counterfeit market is. It is worried because ``valves are quite
frequently refurbished'' and new stems, gates and other parts are
being bought all the time, Grimes said.
   In Jackson, Mich., Consumers spokesman Paul Knopick said a
company consultant discovered suspect parts during a major valve
renovation project. Some parts were discarded on the spot as
obviously no good, some were thrown out after special tests showed
they did not meet specifications and some were installed after the
tests showed they could be used, he said.
   Knopick said he was unable to agree with Grimes that the parts
had been misrepresented by the seller: ``It's too early to conclude
that. That's still under investigation.''
   Palisades was closed for refueling a month early in August when a
steam generator developed a leak, and the valve project was
undertaken during the downtime. It was restarted Dec. 1 and ran for
six days before being shut down again because of another steam
generator leak, and Knopick said Consumers hopes to restart it
before the end of the year.
   The counterfeiting, according to the staff notice to utilities,
``may extend to other manufacturers.''
   A large nuclear plant may have as many as 40,000 valves of all
kinds, 10 times as many as a coal plant of the same power rating.
   A counterfeit valve found earlier at the Diablo Canyon plant of
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in California ``appears to be an isolated
case,'' said William Brach, chief of the vendor inspection branch.
   The Quad Cities circuit breaker was of a large-capacity,
metal-cased design that can be refurbished. The California breakers
were totally enclosed in plastic and designed to be replaced, not
repaired or refurbished, Grimes said.
   The Illinois component had been put through a ``substandard
refurbishment'' in which parts were used that were ``non-genuine and
non-conforming dimensionally,'' he said.
   ``A number of activities are under way to identify the source of
the refurbishment,'' he said.
   Victor Stello, executive director for operations, told the
commission the staff soon would propose a tightening of regulations
on inspection of parts on arrival from vendors. William Hutchinson
of the Office of Investigations said the staff was pursuing 20
investigations of counterfeit parts.

<HEAD>New Centers to Help US Firms Compete</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government named institutions in South
Carolina, New York and Ohio on Tuesday to serve as the first three
regional centers to help funnel scientific advancements to U.S.
businesses so they can better compete against Japanese and other
trade rivals.
   ``We've been winning the Nobel prizes and the Japanese have been
winning the profits,'' said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a
sponsor of the legislation which established the program.
   He spoke at a news conference organized by the Commerce
Department to announce the choice of the three non-profit centers,
from among 36 applicants. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said
there will be additional centers, but he was uncertain whether three
or five more will be sought in the next federal budget.
   Congress has authorized 12 centers altogether, but provided money
only for the first three: $12 million for the year ending next Sept.
30, to be matched by money from indidividual states and the
institutions concerned.
   The first centers will be at the University of South Carolina,
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and at the
Cleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program in Cleveland.
   ``The centers will help smaller firms take advantage of some of
the recent and dramatic advances in manufacturing technology,''
Verity said.
   The centers will inform firms in their areas about new
technology, help them evaluate their needs, support training for
their work forces and share their experiences with others.
   Rensselaer will concentrate on businesses producing parts for the
auto, consumer appliance and electronics industries. The South
Carolina Technology Transfer Cooperative will concentrate on metal
fabrication. The Cleveland group will deal largely with
manufacturing.
   The program is being administered by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, a new body succeeding the National Bureau
of Standards and established by the trade law President Reagan
signed last August.
   In addition to setting standards for industry, the new institute
includes a National Computer and Telecommunications Laboratory, a
National Engineering Laboratory that specializes in semiconductors,
fiber optics and pipelines, and an Institute for Materials Science
and Engineering.

   The State Department urged Americans on Tuesday
to defer travel to Sri Lanka because of the volatile security
situation in the south Asian country.
   A department statement said there is a ``general and increasing

   Hundreds were killed in the recent election campaign, which the
government blamed on a Sinhalese extremist group opposed to the

<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle on Tuesday
picked Robert M. Guttman, his chief Senate counsel, to be his chief
of staff.
   Guttman, 60, also had expressed an interest in returning to the
Labor Department, where in the Nixon administration as associate
solicitor for legislation he helped draft the 1970 Occupational
Health and Safety Act establishing OSHA.
   An 18-year Capitol Hill veteran in various staff positions,
Guttman will oversee a vice presidential staff of 90 once Qualye
assumes office Jan. 20.
   ``This is the first offer I got and it's the best offer I'm going
to get so I took it,'' Guttman said in a telephone interview after
Quayle's announcement. ``It took me between three and seven
seconds.''
   Guttman was named by Quayle as his chief counsel last year after
Democrats assumed control of the Senate following the 1986 election.
   From 1981 through 1984 he was the chief counsel on the Senate
Labor Committee's subcommittee on employment and productivity that
was chaired by Quayle.
   It was in that role that Guttman helped guide the Job Training
Partnership Act sponsored by the freshman Republican senator from
Indiana through Congress despite initial opposition from President
Reagan.
   The law replaced the scandal-ridden Comprehensive Employment
Training Act or CETA progam as the government's main job-training
effort. Administered through $3 billion to $4 billion a year in
federal block grants to states, it basically subsidizes employer
costs in training disadvantaged and retraining dislocated workers.
   A graduate of Harvard with a law degree from George Washington
University, Guttman worked in various staff jobs in the Labor
Department from 1956 to 1970. From 1970 to 1981, he was a specialist
on social legislation for the Congressional Research Service.
   Quayle also formally announced that David C. Beckwith, 46, a
former correspondent for Time magazine, will be his press secretary.
That decision had been reported earlier.

<HEAD>UNICEF: Debt Crisis Killing Children in Developing World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A half-million children died last year
because their Third World countries slashed social welfare spending
when faced with unprecedented debt, UNICEF said Tuesday in its
annual report.
   James P. Grant, UNICEF executive director, urged leaders of
industrialized and developing nations to convene a summit to deal
with the crisis.
   He made the appeal in UNICEF's annual report, ``The State of the
World's Children,'' which he formally released at a New Delhi news
conference telecast live to 40 nations.
   The 500,000 children he mentioned represented only a fraction of
the child deaths in 1987 recorded by the U.N. Children's Fund.
   ``Three million children died last year because they didn't have
50 cents worth of vaccine in them,'' Grant said. Half these deaths
occurred in South Asia.
   Among a few bright spots he highlighted were vaccination programs
in two war-torn countries.
   ``In El Salvador and in Lebanon, in the midst of war, they have
been able to stop the war long enough to immunize their children,''
he said.
   Failure to vaccinate children results not only from the debt
crises but from war, ignorance, lack of health workers and rugged
terrains isolating people from medical care.
   Grant said that for children these were the best and worst of
times.
   ``They are the worst of times because after 35 years of progress,
a significant percentage of mankind _ 900 million people _ is now
sliding backward into poverty,'' he said.
   ``It's the best of times, because low-cost ways (of preventing
children's deaths) are becoming increasingly available.''
   These methods include vaccination against diseases such as
measles, tetanus and whooping cough. Others are oral rehydration
programs, using inexpensive salt solutions that combat diarrhea,
chief killer of small children in many impoverished nations.
   One of the most alarming trends he noted was that 16 nations made
less progress against child mortality last year than they were
making a decade ago because their debt-burdened governments have had
to cut back on social spending.
   ``By far the heaviest consequences are being borne by the
children,'' said Grant. ``For these 16 countries alone, the number
of child deaths in the last 12 months is approximately 650,000 more
than would have been the case if the 1970-80 rate of decline in
under-five mortality had continued.''
   The 16 nations cited by UNICEF are Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama in the
Western Hemisphere and Benin, Botswana, Liberia, Madagascar, Nigeria
and Togo in Africa.
   The UNICEF report said ``the developing world is now transferring
$20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it receives in new
aid and loans.'' Developing nations owe $1.2 trillion to foreign
governments, private banks and development funds.
   ``It's clear that in the '80s, private contributions for
development have doubled while government assistance has declined,''
Grant said. ``The governments should increase their aid, but there
is also the question of public opinion insisting that they do so.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in a pre-recorded preface to
Grant's telecast, said: ``Not only are the present needs of children
neglected but in our greedy growth to development, we are threateing
to mortgage their future.''
   Grant, a U.S. citizen whose Canadian forebears served as doctors
and medical missionaries in India and China, called for a world
summit to focus attention and seek solutions to the problems of
children.
   ``Why shouldn't political leaders of both developing and
developed countries have a world summit on children?'' he asked.
``To reach the unreached, our conclusion is that one must first
reach the unreached's leaders.''

   A spelunker who wrote a manual on how to find
people lost in caves finally took part in his first rescue, leading
a team that found two teen-agers just as searchers were beginning to
fear the boys were in serious trouble.
   Bruce Herschend, who has been a cave explorer for 20 years, and
the team he formed nine years ago found two 16-year-old boys who had
been stranded in a cave for about seven hours Sunday.
   ``For what they had been through, they were in extremely good
condition,'' said Herschend. ``The good thing was, they were very
calm.''
   The Stone County Sheriff's Department refused to release the
names of the two boys, saying they could face trespassing charges in
juvenile court. The cave was on private property near here, about 30
miles south of Springfield in southwestern Missouri.
   Herschend said he did not even know the boys' names.
   The two were reported missing after they failed to return from a
Sunday afternoon outing at Salt Peter Cave. They became stranded
after their two flashlights and a lantern went out, and waited in
the cool, damp cave for more than seven hours before rescuers
reached them, Herschend said.
   Herschend, who manages two other caves near here that are in an
amusement park, was contacted by the local sheriff's department.
   ``Cave search and rescue is totally different from any other type
of search and rescue,'' said Herschend, whose manual gives tips on
cave rescues.
   ``It's important that an expert caver is leading the team on the
initial assault,'' he said. Searchers should be ``very, very
familiar and comfortable in the surroundings. If you've got the
least little bit of anxiety about where you are, that distracts from
the 10,000 other things that should be on your mind.''
   Herschend and three other experienced spelunkers entered the cave
after 11 p.m. Sunday and crawled along an underground stream for 45
minutes without success.
   In most cave rescues, the victims are found within that time,
Herschend said. Worried, he sent one of the initial team back to
form another search team and set up an aid station within the cave.
   But soon after he took those steps, the boys were found waiting
calmly for help at a point where the fairly simple passage became
more complicated, Herschend said.
   ``They went an incredibly long distance, much further than we
expected,'' Herschend said. ``The intrigue and interest in the cave
has a way of luring people on beyond what their common sense should
allow them.''
   Herschend estimated that the two had crawled four miles into the
cave, but said he could not be sure. ``It's hard to tell how far
you've gone when you're crawling on your belly through mud,'' he
said.
   Herschend said he began exploring caves as a child, and became
interested in cave rescues when four cave explorers died after
becoming stranded in another southern Missouri cave 11 years ago.
   When he learned later that most of the members of the first
rescue team had left the area, he turned to fellow explorers and
formed his own team.
   ``Luckily, we're not needed very often,'' he said. ``We prepared
ourselves long ago, and it's just not the kind of thing you forget.''
   Herschend said he has been called on in the past when people have
been believed lost in caves. But until Sunday, authorities either
found the victims by themselves or it was discovered that the
missing people were not in the cave after all.

<HEAD>Report Says Press Freedom Damaged in Democratic Countries</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tabloids, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Press freedom was undermined in 1988 by governments
in the United States, Britain and other democracies, which should
set examples of tolerance, the International Press Institute said in
a report released Tuesday.
   It called the development the ``most worrying aspect'' of its
annual ``World Press Freedom Review,'' which surveyed the press in
82 countries on six continents.
   ``The hopes and encouragement of nations which are on their way
toward more freedom and who rely on an example from countries with a
democratic system, an open society and freedom, must not be crushed
by governments in the free world,'' director Peter Galliner wrote in
an introduction to the report.
   The institute, which has offices in London and Zurich, is an
independent body representing 2,000 publishers and editors in more
than 60 countries.
   Its report cited these examples of official interference:
   _Washington ``continued its efforts to limit public access to
information held by the American government.''
   _The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a former
intelligence analyst for giving satellite photographs of a Soviet
ship to a British magazine. Samuel Loring Morison is serving two
years in prison.
   _Under the new Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement restricts
Canadian journalists working in the United States to those with
university degrees and three years experience. It was the first time
the rule, already part of U.S. law, was ``enshrined in an
international accord.''
   _Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's British government tried to
ban publication of extracts from the ``Spycatcher'' memoirs of
former intelligence agent Peter Wright. Newspapers defeated the
government in court.
   _Britain barred radio or television interviews with 11 groups
involved in Northern Ireland, including Sinn Fein, the legal
political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, in the ``most
drastic action taken against British broadcasters in peacetime.''
   _Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the world's most populous
democracy, agreed only at the last minute to withdraw legislation
shifting the onus of proof of defamation from plaintiff to
journalist.
   _A court court in Australia ordered a journalist to reveal his
sources.
   _Israel suspended three Palestinian newspapers for up to 45 days
and shut down the Palestine Press Service, ``a prime source of
information for the foreign press.''
   Elsewhere, the report found, ``the media under dictatorships
remained all too predictably under lock and key.''
   In Chile there were violent assaults on 24 foreign and Chilean
journalists while five journalists in Colombia were forced to leave
the country following passage of an anti-terrorist law, it said.
   Jordan and Malaysia cracked down on their press, Singapore
continued to pressure the media and China reasserted control on open
discussion and suppressed negative news.
   South Africa closed two church newspapers for three months and
the country's most outspoken anti-apartheid paper, the Weekly Mail,
was suspended for four weeks.
   On the other hand, the report said, many visible and invisible
restrictions were lifted on South Korea's press, and in Taiwan
economic and political liberalizations extended to the media.
   In the Soviet Union, the report declared, ``it seems that
anything goes'' these days. ``No cow, it is tempting to believe, is
too sacred to slaughter. In fact, however, matters are not as simple
as that. ... We should never forget that glasnost (openness) began
as, and remains, a policy guided from above.''

   Some government scientists working on the
nuclear waste repository project in Nevada are unhappy about the
``quality assurance'' paperwork they must do, a member of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday.
   NRC Commissioner Kenneth Rogers said a recent tour he made of the
proposed Yucca Mountain site ``indicates that's a bit of a problem.''
   Rogers commented during a briefing by Samuel Rousso, acting
director of the Energy Department's Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management, on recent waste activities.
   The commission will have to decide whether to issue a license,
currently scheduled for 1995, to the department for operation of a
permanent depot planned for Yucca Mountain. It will store for 10,000
years the highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel from the nation's
reactors that is now building up at each reactor site.
   It is the first operation of the Energy Department to be
subjected to the kind of scrutiny the commission has always given
civilian nuclear power plants. The department's weapons-building
activities are exempt from commission rules.
   Rousso agreed the waste depot project means ``some change in
philosophy and culture,'' and assured Rogers that ``field personnel
will be trained'' in quality assurance.
   Though often confused with quality control, quality assurance is
distinct: It is the proof of quality control, documentation that the
work has been done correctly. An example might be a weld in a pipe
in a nuclear power plant: An X-ray kept on file of the completed
weld showing no flaws would be the assurance that the weld had been
done correctly.
   In the civilian nuclear power industry, the commission insists on
documentation of every step of work, and failure to conform has led
some plants into costly reconstruction before completion.
   The waste project ``is imposing a regulatory process on
scientists who have not operated in this mode in the past ...
geologists, hydrologists,'' Rogers said.
   The dismay, he said, surfaced among ``people who were on the tour
with me, some (of them) government people'' who ``expressed a little
concern about this.''
   In his presentation, Rousso noted that the scheduled beginning of
the first investigative drilling into Yucca Mountain had been
delayed five months to November 1989 ``to ensure that all necessary
quality assurance plans and procedures and other necessary
documentation and analyses are in place.''
   Responding to Rogers, he said, ``Quality assurance is an area we
feel quite strongly about,'' as shown by the formation of a quality
assurance unit several months ago in the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management.

<HEAD>Foreign Diplomats Must `Play the American Game,' Canadian
Ambassador Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign diplomats must forget tradition and
``play the American game'' if they want to be effective in
Washington, the retiring Canadian ambassador said Tuesday.
   Ambassador Allan Gotlieb told a National Press Club audience that
``In Washington, a foreign government is a special interest and not
a very special one at that.''
   ``If you want to be a successful diplomat in Washington, forget
what you have ever learned about traditional diplomacy,'' said
Gotlieb, who arrived in Washington seven years ago. ``Get up, get
out on the field, and play the American game.''
   He likened the political scene to a large magnetic field crowded
with thousands of electrically charged players, ranging from
politicians to lobbyists and reporters, who sometimes form
harmonious patterns but often repel each other.
   ``Political action committees, dressed as trainers, dispense the
steroids of modern politics _ money _ to the players on all sides,''
he said. ``There are no referees.''
   On the Washington political scene, ``every country is famous for
15 minutes,'' he said, adding that Americans mainly were interested
in the recent Canadian election because it affected the U.S. agenda.
   He was asked about an incident several years ago, in which his
wife Sondra slapped the face of the embassy's social secretary at a
Washington dinner for Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Gotlieb said his effectiveness as a diplomat was not harmed by
what he termed ``a spontaneous and unfortunate incident.''
   Gotlieb, who is retiring from public service after 30 years,
becomes chairman of the Canada Council on Feb. 1 and will be a
visiting professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., for
the spring term before settling in Toronto.

<HEAD>Christmas Tree Sparked Fire That Killed Four Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A short circuit in Christmas tree
ornaments apparently sparked a fire Tuesday that destroyed a
single-story home, killing four young children and critically
burning two other people.
   The dead children ranged in age from 1 to 5 years old. Two, a
4-year-old boy and his 1-year-old sister, were dead at the scene,
said John Keane, spokesman for the Duval County Fire Department. Two
brothers, ages 5 and 1, died at University Hospital, authorities
said.
   ``The preliminary investigation indicates the fire was caused by
a short circuit in the ornaments on the Christmas tree in the living
room,'' Keane said.
   Eric Oliver, 22, the uncle of two of the dead children, said he
was sleeping in that room when the fire began about 3 a.m. He warned
the families and was credited with saving three occupants.
   ``By the time I ran to the rooms to get the children out, the
flames were on me,'' Oliver said. ``I didn't even know I was burned,
I was trying so hard to get everyone else out.''
   Firefighters found the single-story home almost completely
engulfed in flames when they arrived, Keane said..
   He identified the dead youngsters as Dedrick Ealy, 4, and his
sister Marnecia Ealy, 1, and brothers Corey Oliver, 5, and Cedrick
Oliver, 1.
   The boys' older sister, Lekeisha Oliver, 15, was in critical
condition at University Hospital with burns and respiratory
injuries, pending transfer to the Shriners' Hospital in Cincinnati,
said hospital spokeswoman Sue Lamb.
   Their mother, Sheryl Oliver, 32, who had serious burns and
respiratory injuries, was airlifted to the burn unit at Shands
Hospital in Gainesville, said Keane, and was also in critical
condition. The Ealys' mother Belinda Ealy, 26, suffered minor burns.
   The fire destroyed the house in a moderate-income neighborhood in
northwest Jacksonville, doing about $45,000 in damage, Keane said.
   Neighbors were stunned by the fatal fire.
   Garrick Green, 22, said he and his nephews had been playing with
some of the children the day before.
   Now, his nephews ``are like zombies,'' Green said. ``They're
taking it really hard. There won't be any Christmas for me.''

<TEXT>
   Some members of Afghanistan's ruling
Communist Party have accused the Soviet Union of betraying them in
recent talks with anti-government rebels, Western diplomats said
Tuesday.
   The reports may lend credence to a rebel claim that Moscow is
ready to negotiate the demise of the government it has supported
with more than 100,000 soldiers. About half the troops have been
withdrawn under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 and the
rest are to be gone by Feb. 15.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party Afghan insurgent
alliance based in Pakistan, told a news conference over the weekend
he felt Moscow was ready to abandon its allies in Kabul.
   Rabanni led the guerrilla delegation to the Dec. 3-5 talks with
Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Dec. 3-5 in
Taif, Saudi Arabia. A second round is to be held in Islamabad later
this month.
   Vorontsov told the guerrillas the Soviets ``don't want the
present regime'' in Kabul, Rabbani said.
   Diplomats in Islamabad said privately some members members of the
ruling party in Kabul accused Vorontsov of a sellout, but one quoted
a deputy minister as saying the ``regime would accept any solution
which did not require all party members to be exiled to the
U.S.S.R.''
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communist
coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in
December 1979.
   Diplomats say about 10,000 Communist Party members and their
families have left Kabul since the Soviet withdrawal began May 15.

   Researchers in West Africa have isolated the
AIDS virus and its African cousin from the same patient, showing
both can infect the same individual, scientists report.
   Previous studies had suggested the two viruses could infect the
same person, but the new study confirms it by isolating the viruses
themselves, researchers said.
   In a tatement from the University of California at San Francisco,
researchers said the finding indicates that individuals infected
with one strain should continue to take precautions against becoming
infected by the second. The combination of both strains might speed
up damage to the immune system, they said.
   The work appears in the Dec. 17 issue of The Lancet, a British
medical journal.
   Researchers from UCSF and Africa reported isolating HIV-1, the
virus that causes AIDS in the United States, and the African HIV-2
virus from a 37-year-old woman from the Ivory Coast.
   The viruses cause a variety of diseases, including acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. AIDS from HIV-1 has killed about 45,000
people so far in the United States, but HIV-2 has been found here in
only one West African patient visiting the United States. The HIV-2
strain has been primarily limited to West Africa and parts of Europe.
   The study was led by UCSF postdoctoral researcher Louise Evans
and Jay A. Levy, professor of medicine and an investigator at the
UCSF Cancer Research Institute.

   Kremlin officials ended their direct supervision of
earthquake relief efforts Tuesday, and attention turned to
rebuilding Armenia's wrecked cities to withstand future quakes.
   The return to Moscow of the Politburo commission led by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, which went to Armenia the day after the Dec. 7
earthquake, indicated rescue operations were coming to an end and a
long period of reconstruction was beginning.
   For the first time since the first days after the quake, news
from Armenia was bumped from the lead item on the evening TV news
program ``Vremya.'' It was replaced by a report on a Kremlin
conference of educators.
   Tass, the official news agency, said more than 500 children had
been reunited with parents or relatives in recent days.
   A leading Soviet seismologist, Nikolai Laverov, told the agency
tremors continued but their pattern indicated they would fade.
   Ryzhkov, in a news conference broadcast on nationwide television
Tuesday, criticized what he said was the ``very low quality of
construction'' of multistory apartment buildings destroyed by the
earthquake.
   The official media said plans were being set to reconstruct
cities such as Spitak and Leninakan to prevent a repeat of the
disaster.
   ``A decision was made to use a method of construction where low
buildings are erected abutting one another. This will help create a
kind of stone belt which will become a protective hoop in case of an
earthquake,'' Tass said.
   The cities will be rebuilt with low stone houses as well as more
standard concrete and reinforced concrete buildings, Tass said.
   The earthquake that devastated northwestern Armenia killed an
estimated 55,000 people. Ryzhkov said 514,000 people were left
homeless.
   Tass said a group of architects, seismologists, geologists and
other experts were working in Yerevan to develop plans for
rebuilding the cities. It promised that all plans would be offered
to the public for debate.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported that sketches had
been prepared for construction of about 3,000 single-family houses
with yards. It said that in the near future, a special store would
be opened where individuals building their own homes can buy the
materials they need.
   A government commission has been formed to study why five- and
nine-story prefabricated concrete apartment houses built in the last
20 years crumbled in the earthquake, while many older buildings
remained standing despite damage.
   Ryzhkov said preliminary findings indicated that the new
buildings could not withstand sharp lengthwise shifts in the ground.
   The earthquake, centered about 25 miles north of Leninakan,
registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   In an interview with Soviet television, Ryzhkov said the first
stage of the relief operation _ that of rescuing survivors _ would
end in ``several days,'' echoing reports in the official media. The
last rescue of an earthquake survivor was reported to have occurred
Saturday.
   In a meeting with reporters on Dec. 12, Ryzhkov said he, Defense
Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and fellow Politburo member Nikolai N.
Slyunkov would remain in Armenia to oversee the relief efforts until
they were certain work was going well and ``the necessary rhythm of
work is guaranteed.''
   He said in an interview with Soviet TV that the commission would
return in January.
   Asked about the danger of epidemic in the earthquake areas, where
thousands of bodies still have not been recovered, Ryzhkov told his
interviewer there was no such danger in the large cities. He said a
danger had existed in villages because of the presence of thousands
of dead animals, but that special teams had the problem under
control.
   Mother Teresa, the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who arrived in
the Soviet Union last week and visited Armenia, was quoted by Tass
as saying, ``I will soon return here together with my sister nuns to
extend aid to the sufferers.''
   ``We have been stunned by the scale of the disaster,'' she was
quoted as saying.
   There was no further word on whether she and Soviet officials had
reached a firm agreement for Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity
to work in the Soviet Union, where charity work by religious
organizations is prohibited by law.
   Mother Teresa met with Ryzhkov on Monday. Since a visit last
year, she has been trying to open the Soviet Union to her
missionaries.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter started a day early out West on Tuesday, and snowfall of
up to 10 inches was reported in northern Michigan, but parts of the
Midwest and East basked in record-breaking warmth.
   High winds were a factor in at least three deaths in Indiana and
Illinois. A strong cold front off the coast of the Pacific Northwest
started to spread wintry weather across much of the Pacific Coast
states. Winter arrives at 10:28 a.m. EST Wednesday.
   Light rain fell at midday along the northern and central Pacific
Coast and snow fell in inland portions of the Pacific Northwest. As
the storm system moved farther inland, snow was expected to increase
and become more widespread, especially in mountain areas, the
National Weather Service said.
   A winter storm warning was posted for the northern Sierra Nevada
range of California as well as higher elevations of the western
Nevada mountains and the Lake Tahoe basin. Between 1 and 2 feet of
snow was expected in parts of the region. Another winter storm
warning remained in effect for the Cascade and Siskyou mountains of
Oregon.
   Winter storm watches and snow advisories were posted for other
parts of Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Washington and northern California.
   In Utah, snow fell overnight and into Tuesday morning in the
northern mountains, with accumulations up to 6 inches reported in
the higher canyon areas.
   Elsewhere, a low pressure area moving through the Great Lakes
spread rain, freezing rain and drizzle over northern Wisconsin as
well as central and eastern Upper Michigan. Heavy snow fell in
western Upper Michigan, with Ironwood receiving 7 inches of new snow
and Ontonagan 8 to 10 inches.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 0.48 inch at North Bend, Ore.; 0.38 inch at Toledo, Wash.;
and 0.24 inch at Medford, Ore. During the same six hours, an inch of
snow fell at Salt Lake City.
   Winds gusted to 70 mph in Indianapolis, 60 mph in Ottawa County,
Mich., and 53 mph at South Bend, Ind.
   Wind gusts were so strong in Indianapolis that a wall under
construction collapsed, killing a construction worker. Wind gusts of
35 mph were blamed for fanning a rapidly spreading blaze that killed
a teen-age girl and her 21-year-old brother at their home in
Gifford, Ill.
   Temperatures early Tuesday afternoon were in the single digits
and teens in northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. But record
warm weather was reported in parts of the mid-Atlantic states to the
Great Lakes, including 49 at Alpena, Mich.; 63 in Baltimore; 57 in
Detroit; 43 in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.; and 63 in Wilkes-Barre and
Scranton, Pa.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees at International Falls, Minn., to 82 degrees at McAllen,
Texas. The early-morning low for the nation Tuesday was 4 degrees
below zero at Cutbank, Mont.
   The forecast for Wedneday called for a cold front to move across
the Appalachians, producing showers and thunderstorms from Louisiana
all the way to New England. The weather system that moved into the
West on Tuesday was expected to spread rain across all of the
Pacific Coast and snow over much of the Intermountain region between
the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada and the mountains of eastern
Oregon and Washington, as well as the northern and central Rockies.
Lake-effect snow showers were forecast for Upper Michigan.
   High temperatures in the teens and 20s were forecast for the
upper Mississippi Valley, the northern Great Lakes and the extreme
northern Plains; in the 30s and 40s from the northern half of the
Pacific Coast, across to the Rockies, the central Plains, the
southern Great Lakes to northern New England; the 70s in southern
Texas, the Gulf Coast, Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast; and
the 50s and 60s in most of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Regional and linguistic antagonisms that have
threatened unity throughout Canada's history are reviving because
Quebec will not comply with a ruling that it allow the posting of
signs in English.
   The Supreme Court said last week the predominantly
French-speaking province is justified in making sure French
predominates on signs but cannot prevent the use of other languages.
   Robert Bourassa, the provincial premier, angered both English
speakers and militants from the majority with his compromise last
Sunday: French must remain the only language on outdoor signs but
other languages can be used indoors so long as French predominates.
   Environment Minister Clifford Lincoln, one of four English
speakers in Bourassa's Cabinet, resigned Tuesday and said: ``In my
beliefs, rights are rights are rights. There are no partial rights.
There are no indoor-outdoor rights.''
   Two of the other English speakers _ Public Security Minister
Herbert Marx and Communications Minister Richard French _ quit later
Tuesday.
   Bourassa based his decision on a clause put into the constitution
by Western provinces as a protection against federal power, which
allows provinces or the national government to override a court
decision.
   The resumption of divisiveness in Canada followed four years of
general calm that made possible the 1987 Meech Lake constitutional
agreement recognizing Quebec as a ``distinct society.''
   Only eight of the 10 provinces have ratified the accord, named
for the place in Quebec where it was signed. Premier Gary Filmon of
Manitoba said Monday he no longer would push for legislative
approval in his Western province because of Bourassa's action.
   New Brunswick, on the Atlantic coast, is the other province yet
to ratify the agreement.
   Filmon described the Quebec decision as a ``national tragedy''
and called for a national conference of provincial leaders to
persuade the French-speaking province to accept the court decision.
   Which language can be used on signs is a volatile and symbolic
issue Quebec's French speakers _ 81 percent of the population _
consider essential to preserving their linguistic and cultural
heritage.
   Bourassa's plan prohibits languages other than French on signs
both outdoors and in such places as shopping malls and interiors of
public transportation facilities.
   An editorial Tuesday in The Globe and Mail of Toronto said:
   ``What now? Almost certainly a hardening of hearts, a less
generous attitude, an unwillingness to spend precious political
capital on bilingualism and francophones, tougher questioning of the
primordiality granted to Quebec's concerns; in sum, a quiet,
unspectacular but undeniable backlash that will do us all no good.''
   La Presse, a widely read Montreal daily, said Bourassa chose
``the best compromise under the circumstances.'' It said either
continuing the ban on any language other than French or allowing
bilingual signs everywhere ``would have been to scorn Quebec
reality, both historic and present.''
   In 1985, Bourassa campaigned for election on a platform that
included easing language restrictions on signs. Critics say he could
have avoided angering militants if he had acted soon after the
election instead of responding to a court ruling three years later.
   A crowd of 10,000 or more attended a rally Sunday in Montreal
demanding no changes in the language law, which was passed in 1977
by the separatist Parti Quebecois gpverment.
   Power in the province shifted from the English-speaking minority
to the French speakers in the 1970s. Separatist sentiment abated
after the language law was passed and Quebec's voters rejected a
sovereignty in a 1980 referendum.

   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, who was re-elected
overwhelmingly last month after the most expensive campaign in Ohio
history, gave his campaign manager a $50,000 Election-Day bonus,
federal disclosure reports showed Tuesday.
   Federal Election Commission records show the Ohio Democrat
rewarded his campaign staff with more than $80,000 in bonuses, in
addition to their salaries.
   All the money came from contributions from Metzenbaum supporters.
   Metzenbaum fought off a well-financed challenge from Cleveland
Mayor George Voinovich. Together, the two candidates spent more than
$16 million _ far exceeding the previous state record of $3.9
million spent by Ohio Sen. John Glenn and GOP challenger James Betz
in 1980.
   Metzenbaum's campaign manager, Peter Harris, defended the bonus
in an interview Tuesday, claiming his total compensation, including
the bonus, was a little more than $71,000. He compared his income to
that of Voinovich's campaign manager, Jim Conrad.
   ``His year-to-date salary was $103,000 and change,'' Harris said
of Conrad. ``I got $71,000 and some change, including the bonus.''
   Vincent Panichi, treasurer for the Voinovich campaign, didn't
dispute Harris' math but said the $103,000 probably reflected money
Conrad earned from pre-1988 campaign work as well as for his work in
1988.
   ``Jim worked for 18 months for $103,000. I don't think that's
outrageous,'' Panichi said.
   ``Of course he was worth it,'' said Panichi, who was calling from
a car phone and was unable to verify immediately the amounts and
dates in campaign records.
   Voinovich's FEC records show no bonuses.
   Harris, who has returned to his pre-campaign job of running
Metzenbaum's Senate staff, said ``Did I deserve $71,000? The answer
is yes. People across the country said it was one of the two or
three best-run campaigns in the United States. It was an $8.5
million venture.''
   He said the money partly reimbursed him for what he would have
earned had he remained on the senator's government payroll as
administrative assistant, and partly reflected the going rate for
managing large campaigns.
   Bob Chlopak, the former executive director of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said big-state campaign managers are
paid ``anywhere from $60,000-$70,000 on the low end to $100,000-plus
on the high end. The sky's the limit.''
   ``Add $50,000 to that for the Republican side,'' he said.
   In all, Voinovich spent about $8 million in his unsuccessful bid
to unseat Metzenbaum, who spent about $8.5 million.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in
Beirut's southern slums Tuesday and police said at least one person
was killed. Six people were reported wounded.
   Shopkeepers in the predominantly Shiite slums lowered their
shutters and pedestrians and motorists took cover when the Shiites
began shooting at each other with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades
and heavy machine guns.
   Police said they did not know what started the battle shortly
after 6 p.m. between Amal, a mainstream militia backed by Syria, and
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The two militias compete for the leadership of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the nation's largest sect. Forty people were killed
and 87 wounded, by police count, in six days of fighting last month
that spread through Moslem south and west Beirut.
   On Tuesday, a police spokesman said Hezbollah gunmen ``apparently
(were) trying to overrun the Amal headquarters'' in the Bourj
el-Barajneh district. Each side accused the other of starting the
fight.
   Most of the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed to be in
the southern suburbs, Hezbollah's stronghold. Held longest is Terry
A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The White House said Tuesday that $150 million
of unspent Energy Department funds ``can be used immediately to
begin whatever work is necessary to improve the safety conditions''
at plants producing nuclear weapons.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked about a Dec. 9
letter by Energy Secretary John S. Herrington saying that some
plants might have to close because of a $360 million shortfall in
funds needed for safety improvements.
   White House chief of staff Kenneth N. Duberstein disagreed with
Herrington's assessment in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' program Sunday, saying the necessary money had been found in
unobligated funds of the department.
   Fitzwater said the issue had been resolved in the budget for the
1990 fiscal year, beginning next Oct. 1, that President Reagan will
submit to Congress on Jan. 9.
   The budget will include $900 million in new money for safety,
environmental cleanup and building of new facilities as it relates
to nuclear processing plants, Fitzwater said.
   He said the Energy Department asked for a supplemental
appropriation of $360 million for the current fiscal year, ``and it
was our judgment that that would be basically too little too late in
the sense that we don't have any plans for a supplemental at this
point.''
   ``Even if we did, it would be September or October, and
therefore, what we suggested was that money be transferred out of
$900 million in unobligated balances that exist from fiscal '89,''
he said.
   ``And so that will be $150 million that can be used immediately
to begin whatever work is necessary to improve the safety conditions
at these plants.''
   Fitzwater also said, ``I repeat the president's statement that no
plant will be operated until it's safe, and that's why we thought it
was crucial to get this money on the project early, and the
supplemental is not a good way to go.''

   President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev are expected to exchange televised greetings on New
Year's Day for the third time, the White House announced Tuesday.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan taped his message last
week and Gorbachev is expected to submit a taped message to U.S.
networks for their consideration soon.
   The exchanges began in 1986 a few months after Reagan and
Gorbachev held their first summit meeting in Geneva.
   The Soviets declined to take part in 1987, saying U.S.-Soviet
relations were not good enough to justify such an exchange. Reagan
broadcast a radio message over the Voice of America, but it was
jammed in the Soviet Union.
   The exchange was resumed in 1988.
   Fitzwater said the president's message ``doesn't deal with policy
issues.''

   The government is taking steps to
free more than 100 Nicaraguan soldiers and civilians held prisoner
in Honduras by Nicaraguan rebels, Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez
Contreras said Tuesday.
   He said the prisoners are being held by the Nicaraguan
Resistance, an umbrella group of forces fighting to overthrow
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Lopez Contreras said the prisoners, Sandinista loyalists, are
being detained in camps at Yamales, a small town about 230 miles
east of Tegucigalpa near the Nicaraguan border.
   The government's moves come as its support fades for Nicaraguan
rebels based on Honduran territory. The rebels, known as Contras, in
turn have been weakened by the cutoff of U.S. aid in February. Rebel
military operations have subsided.
   Lopez Contreras said Roman Catholic Church leaders, the Red Cross
and the London-based International Commission on Human Rights have
agreed to help release the prisoners.
   ``The authorities will proceed to rescue 104 of these
prisoners,'' Lopez Contreras told a news conference Tuesday.
   ``The existence of such Nicaraguan Resistance camps violates our
laws and sovereignty. We will continue efforts to release all the
prisoners in Contra hands.''
   Lopez Contreras said he would risk hampering the rescue operation
if he released details of it.
   Thousands of anti-Sandinista Nicaraguan refugees have been living
in squalid camps in southern Honduras since 1979, when the
Sandinistas overthrew pro-American rightist dictator Anastasio
Somoza.
   Honduras has officially denied the existence of the rebel camps.
In recent months, however, some Hondurans complained of rowdiness by
rebels and pressured the government to expel them.

   Rebels attacked air force
headquarters on Tuesday with truck bombs and explosives lobbed by
catapults, but did not penetrate the base. Two soldiers and two
civilians were reported wounded.
   A fourth mayor in San Miguel province resigned after receiving
death threats from the leftist rebels, who accuse the officials of
participating in a U.S.-backed plans against the guerrilla movement
in their communities.
   The attack on Ilopango air base was the first in nearly seven
years and the second this month on a major military installation in
the capital. Witnesses said it began at about 10:45 a.m. with nearly
simultaneous explosions of two pickup trucks parked outside the wall
150 yards apart.
   Military sources said the rebels lobbed homemade bombs with
makeshift catapults but most exploded against the outer wall of the
base in eastern San Salvador.
   Witnesses said an ice cream vendor and another civilian passer-by
were wounded, and the military sources said two paratroopers were
wounded inside the base. Witnesses and sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Military spokesman Col. Galileo Torres said three vehicles laden
with explosives detonated outside the base, but witnesses and
reporters saw the smoking wreckage of only two.
   A pilot at the base said: ``The security is efficient. This is
the only kind of attack they can mount on us.'' A soldier told
reporters: ``The guerrillas don't have the courage to try to
penetrate. They place a bomb, then run.''
   Rebels set off explosives during an attack on the base in January
1982 that killed nine soldiers and destroyed 12 aircraft. An assault
on National Guard headquarters on the capital's northern edge last
Nov. 1 killed four guardsmen and wounded 34 people, including
civilians.
   Homemade bombs flung by catapult are a favorite weapon of the
rebels, who have fought U.S.-supported governments for nine years.
An estimated 65,500 people have been killed.
   Mayor Tomas Erasmo Campos Rosales of Villa el Transito, 75 miles
east of San Salvador, told reporters he received a death threat from
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a coalition of five
rebel groups.
   Similar letters to the mayors of San Jorge, San Rafael Oriente
and Chinameca caused them to resign last week. All four belong to
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   Eight mayors have been killed since taking office after
nationwide municipal elections in May.
   About 1,000 students rallied outside the Treasury Ministry on
Tuesday to protest the killing of a professor and demand that
December salaries be paid to National University teachers and
workers.
   Imelda Gonzalez Medrano, director of the university law
department, was killed Friday in Santa Ana after leading a similar
protest march in the western city.
   No one was arrested in the killing. Student leaders blame the
government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the army's 2nd
Infantry Brigade in Santa Ana.
   El Salvador's treasury is strapped because of the war. Student
leaders claim the government, which administers the university, owes
teachers and workers $1.2 million.

   Jurors deliberated for a second day
Tuesday in the murder trial of three members of a polygamist clan
charged in the fatal shooting of a law officer during a raid on the
group's compound.
   The Jan. 28 assault by officers at the rural homestead ended a
13-day standoff between authorities and members of the clan, accused
in the bombing of an empty Mormon chapel.
   Clan patriarch Addam Swapp, 27; his brother Jonathan Swapp, 21,
and brother-in-law John Timothy Singer, 22, are charged with
second-degree murder in the death of Corrections Lt. Fred House,
gunned down as he directed attack dogs toward the Swapp brothers
during the raid. In the ensuing firefight, Addam Swapp also was
seriously wounded.
   The eight-member jury, which is being allowed by the judge to set
its own schedule, spent three hours in deliberations Monday. On
Tuesday, jurors put in 8{ hours more before breaking off for the
night without a verdict.
   The siege by 100 FBI-led police officers began Jan. 16, hours
after Addam Swapp bombed the chapel in nearby Marion.
   Both sides agree that Singer fired the fatal bullet, but Singer
maintains he was firing at the dogs, not House.
   In addition to the second-degree murder charges, jurors were
instructed they could consider convicting the three on lesser
charges including manslaughter and negligent homicide.
   Under Utah law, the maximum penalty for second-degree murder is
five years to life in prison. For manslaughter, the maximum term is
zero to five years, and for negligent homicide one year in jail and
a $2,500 fine.
   In connection with the case, 3rd Circuit Judge Maurice Jones
scheduled a Jan. 10 trial for Carla Foster, described by police as
an acquaintance of the clan. She pleaded innocent to a misdemeanor
charge of carrying a concealed weapon.
   Foster said she was on her way to the trial and asked a court
clerk what to do about the small-caliber handgun she carried in her
purse. The clerk told her to ask courthouse security officers, she
said.
   Foster said when she did, she was detained, arrested and charged.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Energy Department will negotiate
with the state to reach a legally binding agreement to clean up a
federally owned uranium processing plant, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   The decision was made late Tuesday, said Douglas Elmets, a
spokesman for the department in Washington. A day earlier, he had
said federal officials were still considering whether the agreement
should be in the form of a consent decree that would be enforceable
through federal courts.
   News reports indicating that the Energy Department was backing
away from a consent decree had prompted state Attorney General
Anthony Celebrezze to insist that Ohio had a commitment that federal
officials should honor.
   When state officials announced a $50 million federal agreement on
Nov. 22 to clean up the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant at
Piketon in southern Ohio they said it could serve as a model for
dealing with contamination at nuclear weapons plants around the
country.
   Elmets said the department reached its decision after discussions
with Ohio officials and consultations with the Justice Department
and the Energy Department's operations office in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   ``This decision was based on the same factors that influenced our
decision on two earlier consent decrees in regard to Fernald
litigation,'' Elmets read from a prepared statement.
   He was referring to the announcement earlier this month of a
court-approved agreement that gave Ohio authority to regulate the
Energy Department's cleanup of the Feed Materials Production Center,
a weapons-grade uranium processing plant in Fernald, 18 miles
northwest of Cincinnati.
   ``We analyze the specific facts of each case and litigation risks
involved, and the overriding consideration in all these cases was
the attractive settlement proposals which were fair to both sides
and made pursuing litigation unwise,'' Elmets said.
   Gov. Richard Celeste and Celebrezze were not immediately
available Tuesday night to comment on the Energy Department's
decision.
   Earlier, Celebrezze had expressed dissatisfaction with what
seemed to be a federal reversal of its promise to negotiate toward a
legally binding agreement.
   ``This is not atypical of the federal government. But we have a
commitment from them, and we expect them to keep it,'' he said. ``I
will accept nothing less than a consent decree.''
   Elmets said the decision Tuesday does not mean the Energy
Department will pursue similar agreements with other states that
claim its nuclear facilities have polluted the environment.
   He also would not discuss details of any proposals put forth by
the state.
   The Piketon plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial
nuclear power reactors. It generates toxic wastes such as
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, solvents and metals, as well as
radioactive materials.
   Piketon site manager Eugene Gillespie, an Energy Department
employee, said some of the cleanup work that is included in the
agreement began Dec. 1, and plans for further action have been
submitted to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, which is to
supervise the cleanup of about 6 million pounds of waste.

   The right-wing Likud bloc's delegates narrowly
approved a coalition agreement with the left-leaning Labor Party
early Wednesday, another step toward formation of the next Israeli
government, Israeli radio said.
   The agreement still needs approval by the Labor Party's
1,200-member central committee, which planned to meet for a vote
Wednesday afternoon. If Labor approves, the national unity
government could be presented to the Knesset, or parliament, on
Thursday.
   Guidelines of the new government ban talks with the PLO, setting
Israel on a collision course with the United States.
   The new government will be remarkably similar to the outgoing
national unity government, except that Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, the Likud leader, will be prime minister throughout the
four-year term. In the previous term, Labor leader Shimon Peres, the
current foreign minister, was premier for the first two years.
   Likud delegates voted in a secret ballot Tuesday night, after a
stormy meeting in which opponents led by Ariel Sharon, Likud's
former defense minister, fought a last ditch effort to overturn it.
   Israeli radio said 796 delegates, or 55 percent, voted for the
agreement, and 642 delegates, or 44.4 percent, voted against. The
final tally was reported just after 3 a.m. Wednesday (8 p.m. EST
Tuesday).
   Sharon told the delegates who met in Tel Aviv that Labor was an
unfit partner because it favored withdrawal from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip and some of its members approved of talking to
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel views the PLO as a terrorist group.
   Shamir told the delegates that if the party did not approve the
agreement at the meeting he would go to President Chaim Herzog and
give up the mandate he was given to form a new government. Such a
move would throw Israel's political system into a state of confusion.
   Herzog had given Shamir, whose party slightly edged out Labor in
Nov. 1 elections, until Dec. 26 to form a new government.
   Labor Cabinet ministers, meanwhile, approved the coalition pact
Tuesday. The agreement will be submitted Wednesday to the party's
1,000-member central committee.
   Peres said formation of the new coalition would spell defeat for
the proposed ``Who is a Jew'' legislation that was vehemently
opposed by U.S. Jews.
   That prospect touched off wrangling between Shamir and the four
religious parties, who originally demanded the legislation and now
threaten to stay out of the coalition.
   Shamir hopes to include the religious parties to make it more
difficult for Labor to bring down the government should an impasse
occur.
   Yitzhak Peretz of the Ultra-Orthodox Shas party accused Shamir of
breaking his pledges. ``He promised us and signed an agreement to
help change the Law of Return,'' he said.
   The Law of Return grants automatic Israeli citizenship to all
Jews, and the amendment would require Orthodox approval of all
conversions to Judaism. U.S. Jews feel the legislation will divide
the Jewish community.
   Shamir said Labor and Likud were united in standing up to the
``common danger'' _ Arab demands for creation of an independent
Palestinan state.
   ``There is a common danger to all of us, the establishment of a
Palestinian state. Both Labor and Likud see it as a danger, and the
government will deal with it in a unified effort,'' he said.
   Although fear of too much influence by the religious parties had
already sparked public support for another unity government, the
latest agreement also was spurred by the U.S. decision last week to
open a dialogue with the PLO. Shamir aides said they wanted to
present a unified front against the move by their greatest ally.
   Peres told reporters the new government guidelines mean ``there
will be no negotiations with the PLO.''
   The decision to ban talks with the PLO puts Israel increasingly
out of step with the rest of the international community, and could
strain relations with Washington, which provides $3 billion a year
in economic and military aid to the Jewish state.
   Israeli officials said the new government would give top priority
in the next two months to devising a peace formula that will be an
acceptable alternative to dealing with the PLO.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
guidelines call for talks based on the 1978 Camp David accords which
envision limited autonomy for Palestinians and the participation of
Jordan in the peace process.
   There will be few new faces in the new government. Labor and
Likud will each control 10 seats in the Cabinet, which will have a
total of 24 or 25 members. Key policy decisions, however, will be
made by Shamir, Peres, Labor's Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
Likud's Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a close Shamir ally and former
ambassador to the United States.
   Peres will become finance minister, a post Labor officials urged
him to take in order to help debt-ridden party institutions such as
the Histradrut trade union federation and the kibbutz movement of
communal farms.
   The institutions form the backbone of the Labor Party and are
crucial to its support.

   A robber in a Santa Claus hat and
beard snatched more than $700,000 from two armored car guards
Tuesday in this fashionable suburb's third large heist in a little
more than five years.
   Police and FBI officials said the man, who wielded a
silver-colored revolver, took two sacks of cash from Dunbar Armored
Security Inc. guards outside a United Bank branch shortly after 9
a.m.
   ``This is not a joke. Get up against the wall. Give me the bags
of money,'' the robber told the guards, according to police Capt.
Russell Hughes.
   No shots were fired and neither guard was injured, police said.
The robber hopped into a car with an accomplice and they drove off
on a nearby highway, Hughes said.
   Authorities suspect that the robbers tailed the armored car to
the bank, said Terry Shumard, a spokesman for the FBI. He said the
two bags held more than $700,000 in cash.
   ``Santa'' didn't have a red suit to match his hat and false
beard, officials said: He was dressed in a gray trenchcoat.
   Hughes said the guards were engaged in ``routine'' business at
the bank, but he didn't have any further information. Carla Dunbar,
a receptionist at the armored car company, said officials would have
no comment.
   Employees and the two or three customers inside the bank at the
time were unaware the theft was taking place, said teller Jane E.
Neveu.
   It was the second armored car heist in two years in the Hartford
suburb and the third big theft since 1983.
   On March 4, 1987, three men stole $1 million in cash from a
Loomis Armored Inc. truck parked outside a branch of the Bank of
Boston. No suspects were ever apprehended.
   The town's most notorious heist occurred on Sept. 12, 1983, when
$7.1 million was taken from a Wells Fargo depot. The government
contends that a security guard, Victor Gerena, pulled the robbery to
help finance a Puerto Rican independence movement.
   Sixteen people were charged in connection with that robbery. So
far, two pleaded guilty and five are on trial in U.S. District
Court. Federal authorities say they think that Gerena is in Cuba.
   Carl Rosensweig, a West Hartford police detective, said that
although the number of large heists in the town of 60,000 is
unusual, there is no evidence they are related.

   The stepson of a newspaper executive was found
guilty Tuesday of trying to murder his girlfriend after she rebuffed
his marriage proposal. The shooting left her paralyzed for life.
   Jurors rejected Bradley Ackerman's defense that he was crazed by
drugs and intent only on suicide when he shot 23-year-old Julie
Alban, whom he had dated for nearly 10 months, as she lay sleeping
in her parents' home June 8.
   Ackerman, 24, then turned the gun on himself, but he recovered
from his wounds.
   The tragedy involved families who lived across the street from
each other and youngsters raised in a world of wealth and privilege.
Ackerman is the stepson of Daniel Ridder, chairman of the Long Beach
Press-Telegram. Miss Alban is the daughter of a prominent orthopedic
surgeon.
   Ackerman showed no emotion as the verdict was read in a packed
courtroom. Ridder, who sat in a front-row seat, was grim-faced as it
was announced and rushed from the courtroom without comment.
   Jurors found Ackerman guilty of willful, premeditated attempted
first-degree murder. They further found that he used a gun illegally
and intentionally inflicted great bodily harm on Miss Alban, who
testified from a wheelchair.
   Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith said he considered Ackerman a
suicide risk and ordered him held in the hospital section of the
county jail. Sentencing was set for Feb. 6.
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Kenneth Lamb, said the
only sentence possible on Ackerman's attempted murder conviction is
life in prison with the possibility of parole. An additional
five-year sentence is possible on the two gun-related charges, he
said.
   Prosecutors said Miss Alban had spurned Ackerman's marriage
proposal just hours before the shooting.
   ``There can never be justice for me,'' Miss Alban told KNBC-TV
after learning of the verdict. ``I'm going to be in a wheelchair the
rest of my life ... battling complications. Brad may be out ... in
10 years.''
   ``It was clearly a justified verdict,'' said Lamb. ``No matter
what happens to Bradley Ackerman, his sentence to Julie was death
and, failing that, he sentenced her to life in a wheelchair.''
   But Ackerman's lawyer, Anthony Murray, said the verdict was
decided emotionally, not on the facts.
   ``This was an extremely emotional jury,'' he said. ``The
courtroom was charged with emotion when the `little girl' (Miss
Alban) came in to testify. They couldn't focus on the facts.''
   Ackerman claimed he was in a Valium-induced stupor when he shot
Miss Alban with a single bullet to the back, paralyzing her below
the waist.
   His lawyer argued that the young man had taken 30 pills in an
attempt to kill himself out of depression over a $30,000 gambling
debt and his failure to fulfill his early promise as a tennis player.
   Ackerman testified he did not remember shooting Miss Alban. She
testified that she was awakened by a bullet ripping into her spine,
then dragged herself to a telephone and called for help.
   Lamb told jurors that Ackerman's precision in firing the
.38-caliber revolver showed he was not suffering from a Valium
blackout.
   He portrayed Ackerman as a rejected suitor, a selfish,
irresponsible man who invented the blackout defense to escape
responsibility for his action.

<HEAD>`Happy Birthday To You,' The Song, Being Sold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ``Happy Birthday To You'' is not just a tune
to warble on the appropriate occasions, it's a solid investment with
good profit potential, says an official of the company that's buying
it.
   Geoffrey Holmes, senior vice president of Warner Communications,
Tuesday confirmed a report that the giant entertainment company was
buying the birthday song and the New Jersey publishing company that
owns it. But he wouldn't confirm the reported price, $25 million.
   ``This is a business deal,'' Holmes said. ``We're approaching
this whole thing in that it's a very attractive deal to them and to
us. If it wasn't economical, we certainly wouldn't do it.''
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Warner Chappell, a
division of Warner Communications, will pay $25 million for
Birchtree Ltd. of Princeton. The newspaper cited an unidentified
executive familiar with the negotiations. Birchtree spokeswoman Kate
Shen also confirmed that Warner Chappell, which is the world's
largest music publisher, was buying the family-owned Birchtree. But,
like Holmes, she wouldn't confirm the reported price tag.
   ``It's agreed to, but it's not closed,'' Ms. Shen said. ``The
song should be Warner's by the end of the year.''
   Holmes would not say what the return on ``Happy Birthday'' has
been, but it is believed to be about $1 million a year. The company
plans to boost revenues from the song by increasing marketing, he
said.
   Holmes said the company likes the idea of owning a classic, but
he stressed that Warner is not buying the song for prestige or
sentimental reasons.
   ``We think there are a lot of opportunities to further exploit
the song,'' Holmes said. ``We think we can further enhance the
song's royalties.''
   The birthday staple and the company were put on the block in
October because Birchtree lacked the resources to monitor and
protect copyrights, said Birchtree Chairman David Sengstack, whose
family owns the company. A copyright issued on the song in 1935
expires in 2010.
   Warner Chappell has a large operation to protect copyrights _
that is, make sure people who use the songs for profit pay royalties
_ and would be able to reduce costs of protecting ``Happy Birthday''
and other Birchtree songs, Holmes said.
   Warner Chappell already owns the rights to songs by George and
Ira Gershwin, Michael Jackson and Cole Porter, among others.
   Altogether, Birchtree owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700
are actively collecting royalty fees. Spokesmen said that, compared
with ``Happy Birthday To You,'' the other titles are obscure.
   The song began as a classroom greeting in 1893 penned by two
schoolteacher sisters from Louisville, Ky., Patty Smith Hill and
Mildred J. Hill. The birthday lyrics were added later.
   Since then, it has become one of the three most frequently sung
songs in the English language, along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and
``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of
World Records.
   Birchtree also owns the Suzuki Methods, an instrumental
instruction method for violin, cell and viola.
   ``Happy Birthday'' and Birchtree are to be only the latest of
Warner's expanding music publishing business. Last year it spent
about $275 million to by Chappell & Company, which was privately
owned.

   Anti-abortion groups, many already suspicious
of George Bush's commitment to their cause, have bombarded the Bush
camp with objections to the possible appointment of Louis Sullivan
as secretary of health and human services.
   A report quoting the Atlanta educator's sentiments on abortion
created a furor among conservatives, and anxiety about what one
group called ``a slap in the face to the millions of anti-abortion
voters.''
   Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine, told
Bush in an interview last week that if appointed he would support
the president-elect's anti-abortion campaign positions, according to
Bush's press secretary Sheila Tate.
   But concern flared anew, said Jack Fowler, Washington chief of
the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life, when the Atlanta Journal
and Constitution quoted him Sunday as saying he supported a women's
right to abortion though he opposed federal funding.
   Transition sources have said for many days that Sullivan was the
front-runner for the health and human services post but that Bush
had not formally offered him the job. A Bush transition spokesman,
David Prosperi, said Tuesday that Sullivan was still under
consideration.
   ``Our discussions with Dr. Sullivan have been ... very
encouraging,'' transition team leader Craig Fuller told CBS News.
``We feel he is a very strong candidate. I think we'd like to go
forward with him and I think we're pretty close to that.''
   A statement from Fowler's group said Sullivan's appointment would
be a ``slap in the face'' to conservatives and would continue ``the
obstructionist tactics pro-abortion HHS Secretary Otis Bown has
employed against anti-abortionists.''
   ``Generally among the various conservative and right-to-life
groups in town there is confusion and thus concern about his
possible appointment,'' said Gary Bauer, who was former White House
domestic policy adviser to President Reagan and now heads the
private Family Research Council.
   Bauer said such an appointment would be ``politically stupid,''
because it would alienate a constituency that supported Bush in the
campaign.
   He said his group and others have told Bush transition officials
of their ``great discomfort'' at the thought of having Sullivan in
the Cabinet.
   Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., said abortion was the one issue about
which he was ``distrustful'' of Bush before he decided to endorse
the vice president's presidential candidacy.
   Bush satisfied Dornan that his position was in line with the
conservative stance, but Dornan said Tuesday that Bush ``will rue
the day he picks'' Sullivan.
   Bush has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or danger to the mother's life. He supports a constitutional
amendment to make abortion illegal, and opposes federal funding for
abortion.
   Sullivan echoed those positions in a Dec. 18 letter that was
being circulated to conservative groups and was published in
Wednesday's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. The letter said,
``I am writing to clarify my position on abortion. I am opposed to
abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the
mother is threatened... My position on abortion is entirely
consistent with President-elect George Bush's position.''
   Sullivan did not return reporters' calls.
   Transition officials denied suggestions that the
Sullivan-abortion issue caused the sudden cancellation of Cabinet
announcements Tuesday.
   Transition personnel director Chase Untermeyer told reporters the
abortion issue is important and that ``I am confident that whoever
is the nominee is certain to conform.''
   The conservatives fear another secretary like Reagan appointee
Otis Bowen, who they say has supported Reagan's anti-abortion views
in word only.
   ``We need an advocate for the pre-born, not a yes man who
undermines everything from behind the scenes,'' said Dornan.
   Sullivan's statement lining up with Bush's positions did not
satisfy the National Right to Life Committee, which last week wrote
to Bush objecting to Sullivan.
   The group's president, John Willke, said in a statement that even
though Sullivan may pledge to carry out the Bush agenda, ``only a
person who shares president-elect Bush's pro-life ethic and
convictions can make genuinely pro-life decisions on the hundreds of
day-to-day matters which cannot all be referred to the president.''
   Another aspect of the abortion issue that conservatives consider
anathema is the use of fetal tissue for research. The Atlanta
newspaper quoted Sullivan as supporting that practice and saying,
``We have a number of medical advances that have occurred as a
result of research with fetal tissue that have benefited the lives
of many people.''
   Transition spokesman Prosperi said he did not know Bush's
position on that issue.

   George Bush's aides scrambled Tuesday to
contain a sudden outburst over the abortion views of Louis W.
Sullivan, an Atlanta educator who is the leading contender for
health and human services secretary.
   The president-elect did announce two other appointments _ former
Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt and former Ohio Rep. Thomas L. Ashley to the
National Economic Commission _ but did so in writing and didn't face
reporters' questions about Sullivan.
   He canceled a session to name additional Cabinet choices.
   Pro-choice abortion remarks attributed to Sullivan, president of
the Morehouse School of Medicine, brought protests from
anti-abortion groups and threw up an obstacle to his selection as
HHS chief, Bush transition and congressional sources said.
   Transition officials, stressing privately that Bush had not
formally offered Sullivan the post, denied publicly that his remarks
over the weekend in an interview with the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution had caused any delay in announcing new Cabinet chiefs.
   The officials said Sullivan remains the top candidate for health
and human services.
   ``Our discussions with Dr. Sullivan have been ... very
encouraging,'' transition leader Craig Fuller told CBS News. ``We
feel he is a very strong candidate. I think we'd like to go forward
with him and I think we're pretty close to that.'' Fuller also told
NBC, ``He's met with the vice president, he's explained his views,
and Dr. Sullivan and George Bush, I believe, see eye-to-eye on the
question of abortion.''
   In the interview, Sullivan said he supports the right of a woman
to seek an abortion, while opposing the use of federal funds to pay
for it.
   That appeared to be at odds with a statement issued last week by
transition officials, after a meeting between Bush and Sullivan,
suggesting the medical school official had assured Bush he shared
the vice president's anti-abortion views.
   If appointed, Sullivan would be the first black named to Bush's
Cabinet.
   Bush himself took no questions during a picture-taking session at
a meeting with business leaders at which he promised anew not to
raise taxes.
   In a statement appointing Laxalt, a Republican, and Ashley, a
Democrat, to the 14-member National Economic Commission, Bush
praised both as having ``long and distinguished careers.''
   The panel, named by Congress in the aftermath of the October 1987
stock market plunge, is striving to find a bipartisan way to
eliminate the federal budget deficit.
   Laxalt is a former governor of Nevada, close friend of President
Reagan and former general chairman of the Republican National
Committee. Ashley, former senior Democrat on the House Banking
Committee, is a longtime friend of Bush's and a former college
classmate at Yale.
   As for Cabinet appointments, Sheila Tate, Bush's spokeswoman,
said, ``There's no connection between lack of an announcement and
the HHS situation.''
   She said Bush and Sullivan had discussed abortion and Sullivan
``indicated that if he were nominated he would support the vice
president's position.''
   In any event, the delay meant yet another trip to Washington for
Chicago transit official Samuel Skinner, Bush's apparent choice for
transportation secretary.
   To announce Skinner's appointment alone might have subjected Bush
to questioning on the abortion controversy, an issue he did not want
to get into while the HHS appointment was still up in the air, the
sources said.
   Skinner, chairman of the Northeastern Illinois Mass Transit
Authority, was summoned to Washington last week by transition
officials for an expected announcment that was then postponed by
Bush.
   He returned to Chicago for the weekend, then was summoned back on
Monday, then told by transition officials his appointment would come
on Tuesday.
   Sources earlier said that Bush had planned to announce Skinner's
appointment as transportation secretary on Monday and would likely
couple it with the selection of the first black in his Cabinet _
either Sullivan or Julius W. Becton Jr., a three-star retired Army
general reportedly in line for secretary of veterans affairs.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported Tuesday that Sullivan had said
Monday evening he was having trouble getting calls to the White
House returned.
   ``I have simply concluded that, as a result of my not receiving a
call back, the things have been put off, and hopefully it's not
anything worse than that.''
   Sullivan told the newspaper his pro-choice stand on abortion is a
private view and he does not intend to disagree publicly with Bush's
anti-abortion views.
   He said he believes ``there should be that right (to abortions).
... At the same time, I am aware of the fact that the
president-elect feels that that should not be the case, and I would
have to, as secretary, should I be appointed, carry out his
policies.''
   Sullivan's congressional supporters on Tuesday were circulating
among anti-abortion leaders a letter in which he said, ``I am
opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the
life of the mother is threatened. ... My position on abortion is
entirely consistent with President-elect George Bush's postion.''
The letter also was published in Wednesday's editions of The Atlanta
Constitution.
   However, Gary Bauer, who was President Reagan's domestic policy
adviser and now heads the private Family Research Council, said the
possibility of a Sullivan appointment had caused ``great
discomfort'' among conservatives, and they have made that known to
Bush transition officials.
   Sullivan's office in Atlanta referred all calls Tuesday to the
vice president's office.
   Chase Untermeyer, the transition personnel director, asked if
abortion views were a ``litmus test'' for the appointee, said,
``It's quite important. ... I am confident that whoever is the
nominee is certain to conform with the president's philosophy.''
   He commented at a briefing by transition officials, sponsored by
the National Press Foundation.
   Meanwhile, a Reagan administration source said Patricia Diaz
Dennis, a member of the Federal Communications Commission, appeared
to be fast emerging as the No. 1 contender for the post of labor
secretary.
   Ms. Dennis, a former member of the National Labor Relations
Board, has wide support among top Bush transition officials,
according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Bush has yet to name a woman to a Cabinet post, although he has
selected Washington lawyer Carla Hills to be his chief trade
negotiator _ a job that has Cabinet-level status.

   Maoist rebels cut transportation to a
trickle Tuesday and shut down nearly all schools and offices in this
important highland city in a general strike which they threatened to
enforce with weapons.
   Scores of police and soldiers patrolled Huancayo's nearly empty
streets, but no reports emerged of violence or other guerrilla
activity.
   It was the second so-called ``armed strike'' declared by the
Shining Path guerrillas in recent weeks. They paralyzed Ayacucho,
their stronghold about 100 miles southeast of Huancayo, for a week
in late November with a similar strike.
   The rebels called the three-day strike in Huancayo, 125 miles
east of Lima, on Monday.
   The state government was quoted as saying Tuesday's strike had no
impact. Abilio Fernandez, the chief administrative officer of Junin
state, said activity was normal throughout the state, according to a
dispatch by the state news agency Andina.
   However, reporters for The Associated Press and other media said
nearly everyone stayed indoors, apparently in fear of guerrilla
reprisals.
   The strike came a day after Favio Llerena, deputy to Fernandez,
said dozens of small-town mayors and farming hamlet officials across
the state resigned after receiving death threats by the rebel group.
   For two years, Huancayo and the surrounding Mantaro River valley,
an important mining and agricultural area, have been targets of the
Shining Path insurgency to topple Peru's elected government and
install a Marxist state.
   Officials say the violence is part of the guerrillas' overall
goal of weakening Peru by fomenting political and economic chaos to
pave the way for the rebels to seize power.
   ``The Mantaro Valley is practically taken over by the Shining
Path, and there seems to be no way to defend it,'' former Industry
Minister Guillermo Arteaga said over the weekend.
   Authorities declared a state of emergency throughout Junin a
month ago as attacks increased dramatically on villages, power
installations, railroads, bridges and large cooperative farms.
   Parts of eight states with more than half the nation's 21 million
people are under emergency measures that give the military
wide-ranging powers to police and govern. The capital, Lima, is
under the regulations.
   The government says the Shining Path insurgency has claimed more
than 12,000 lives and caused damage of more than $10 billion, four
times the amount of the nation's yearly exports.

<HEAD>``Sally'' and ``Prince,'' Two Plays by Charles Fuller, Open
Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Credit playwright Charles Fuller with setting up
an ambitious project for himself _ a cycle of five plays dealing
with the black experience in the United States from the Civil War to
the turn of the century.
   But his ambitions have gotten the best of him, at least in the
first two of these historical dramas, called ``Sally'' and
``Prince,'' which arrived over the weekend at off-Broadway's Negro
Ensemble Company.
   The plays, both set during the Civil War, are sketchy historical
melodramas, long on plot and short on poetry or power. They
reiterate the same themes, particularly about freedom or the lack of
it for blacks, first under the slavemasters of the Old South and
then under the economic overlords of the North. The plays say they
traded one serfdom for another.
   The subject is discussed early on in ``Sally,'' which had its
world premiere last summer in Atlanta at the National Black Arts
Festival. Despite its title, the play deals mostly with a group of
black Union soldiers who are forced to take a pay cut and earn less
than their white counterparts.
   Some are defiant and pay the price with their lives. Others
accept it and pay a different kind of penalty. One who acquiesces is
Prince Logan, an ambitious black soldier who is the most interesting
character in both plays. His dilemma _ to follow the Army or revel
in his newly won freedom _ merits most of your attention.
   It is Prince's survival that Fuller chronicles in these two
dramas, and I suspect the man will turn up in other plays in this
series. You don't need to see both of the first two dramas to
understand his character, but it helps. Samuel L. Jackson's
persuasive, even noble, performance as Prince also helps. It's a
portrayal that deepens in the second play as Fuller tries to deal
with the dislocation and disorientation of the newly freed slaves.
   These intentions get sidetracked by a lot of peripheral events,
directed by Douglas Turner Ward and acted by the rest of the large
cast at a feverish pace. There are plenty of gunshots, a stabbing or
two and some heavy-handed attempts at sexual humor. The dialogue is
often flat, more concerned with recounting events than illuminating
character.
   Consider the first play, the weaker of the two evenings of drama.
Although she is the title character, Sally remains the most elusive
person on stage. Tragic things happen to her _ her husband is
poisoned, her son is killed by rebel troops, her affair with Prince
ends malevolently _ but throughout her troubles, we never get to
know the woman. Michelle Shay, a fine actress, is stymied by the
underwritten role.
   Another good performer, Hattie Winston, has a better time of it
in ``Prince,'' where she plays Lu, an indominable camp follower who
also manages to live _ and profit _ through the war.
   In ``Prince,'' the focus switches from military to civilian, the
ex-slaves who have to work the cotton fields for new masters from
the North. These new employers _ a church group formed to help
ex-slaves _ may seem more benevolent, at first, but their rule
becomes just as tyrannical.
   The action takes place on a gray, utilitarian setting by Charles
McClennahan. It's simple but effective, allowing the fast-moving
action to unfold quickly and with a minimum of fuss.
   In many ways, Fuller's plays tackle the same themes as August
Wilson's ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' the story of ex-slaves
coming to terms with their past. Wilson's drama contains some
haunting and painful but strangely beautiful images. ``Sally'' and
``Prince'' paint much more literal pictures. We'll have to wait for
the next three plays to see if Fuller's vision is more fully
realized.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Palestinian State May Come Within Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Tuesday he
believes an independent Palestinian state can be established within
two years in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In comments on Austrian radio, Arafat expressed caution when
asked about creating a Palestinian government-in-exile.
   ``We have to think what the Israeli reaction will be,'' he said.
``Some of those people (designated members of a government-in-exile)
live in the occupied territories. How would Israel treat these
people? Would they arrest them, would they expel them?''
   Asked when a Palestinian state could be set up, Arafat replied,
``We think within two years ... perhaps something less.''
   At a news conference later, the leader of the Palestine
Liberation Organization reaffirmed his organization's commitment to
Middle East peace but vowed that the year-old Palestinian uprising
against Israel will continue.
   ``We have definite reports that the Israeli leadership is bent on
perpetrating yet more crimes and terrorist operations in order to
torpedo the process of peace,'' Arafat charged.
   He angrily rejected any questioning of the sincerity of the PLO
peace initiative, with leaders of his own organization threatening
sabotage.
   ``Whatever I have said in Geneva was done on the basis of a
resolution passed by the PLO Executive Committee as well as on the
basis of a resolution passed by the Palestine National Council _
which took place in a democratic atmosphere and by majority vote,''
he said.
   But a senior Palestinian source, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said PLO hardliners backed by Syria met in Damascus on
Tuesday to discuss ways to scuttle Arafat's initiative and oust him
from leadership.
   Mustafa el-Zibri, a member of the PLO governing body, on Monday
reflected a possible serious split in top ranks by calling Arafat's
recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism ``Arafat's
personal opinion.''
   Over the weekend, Salah Khalaf, second-in-command of Arafat's own
Fatah faction, declared, ``(President) Reagan may stop his
government's dialogue with the PLO now if he thinks he will be able
to stop our attacks against Israeli military targets.''
   The PLO is an umbrella for several Palestinian factions which
often feud among themselves. PLO factions have launched attacks on
Israel without Arafat's approval. Other groups do not belong to the
organization. Arafat has said he cannot guarantee that every
Palestinian group will refrain from terrorism.
   He spoke before leaving Vienna to take his campaign for an
international conference on the Middle East to Yugoslavia,
apparently hoping to win support from a leading ally in the
non-aligned movement.
   His European trip also included visits in the past week to East
Germany and Romania. The PLO says he also plans to go to Greece,
Italy, Spain and France.
   The visits follow Washington's recent reversal of its 13-year
boycott of the PLO.
   AT PLO headquarters in Tunis on Tuesday, executive committee
member Yasser Abd-Rabboo said indirect contacts with the U.S.
government began in March when Washington relayed conditions for the
PLO to meet before it would open formal talks.
   The two traded counterproposals for months, he said.
   They seemed a prelude to the intense diplomatic maneuvering
through Swedish intermediaries that led to the PLO's meeting U.S.
conditions last week and to the first talks with the organization.
   Abd-Rabboo took part in the first meeting Friday with U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau, Jr.
   He said messages relayed through Americans of Palestinian
heritage followed the failure of Secretary of State George Shultz to
find any notable Palestinians to speak with on a visit to Arab east
Jerusalem early this year.
   ``They gave signals that the American administration, after
Shultz had failed to find an alternative to the PLO ... was thinking
in a new way ... to deal with the PLO directly,'' he said.

   Alphonse Ouimet, a former president of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. who helped introduce television to
Canada 40 years ago, died on Tuesday. He was 80.
   Ouimet went to work for the CBC as an engineer when it was
founded 52 years ago. In 1958, he became president and held that
post for nine years.
   In the 1940s, Ouimet studied the operation of a new phenomenon _
television _ in the United States and Europe, and played a major
role in introducing it to Canadian audiences.
   In recent years, Ouimet spoke out against government funding cuts
for the CBC. When the corporation celebrated its 50th birthday in
1986, Ouimet said, ``Never has the CBC found itself as limited,
contested and even rejected, not by the public, but in government
circles.''
   After leaving the CBC, Ouimet headed a UNESCO conference on
satellite technology in broadcasting and served as president of
Telesat Canada from 1969 to 1980.
   No cause of death was announced. Funeral services will be held
Friday in Outremont, a Montreal suburb.

   The jury weighing the fate of former Miss America
Bess Myerson asked Tuesday to re-hear testimony by the prosecution's
chief witness at the divorce-fixing conspiracy trial.
   The panel, which got the case Monday, asked to have Sukhreet
Gabel's testimony about a secret June 1986 meeting with Miss Myerson
read back to them as well as U.S. District Judge John Keenan's
instructions on the law governing circumstantial evidence.
   The jurors then continued deliberating until they recessed for
the night at 9:30 p.m. after about 10 hours of work.
   Miss Myerson, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is
accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to Ms. Gabel to
influence her mother, a judge making interim rulings in the divorce
of Miss Myerson's lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   The prosecution's case against Miss Myerson, 64, Capasso, 43, and
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 76, consisted of
mainly circumstantial evidence because there were no witnesses to
the alleged bribe scheme.
   In instructing the jury, Keenan had said that circumstantial
evidence ``if believed, is of no less value than direct evidence.
But in either case, the essential elements of the crimes charged
must be established by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   All three are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and promoting
bribery. Miss Myerson also is charged with obstruction of justice
for allegedly trying to influence Ms. Gabel's grand jury testimony.
   According to Ms. Gabel, her former boss came unannounced to her
apartment building in June 1986, while the grand jury was
investigating her hiring.
   Ms. Gabel testified that Miss Myerson told her during a nighttime
walk around the block that ``you could be dangerous'' and that she
should ``keep your mouth shut.''
   Ms. Myerson faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and $513,000 in
fines if convicted on all counts. Her co-defendants face up to 25
years and $263,000 in fines if convicted.

   The problems of the homeless are so severe that
drastic action including civil disobedience is sometimes necessary,
activists testified Tuesday at a hearing for a colleague charged
with trespassing.
   People are freezing to death, families are breaking down and
children are being exposed to drug and alcohol addicts because
society fails to take care of the homeless, said Mary Ann Gleason, a
member of the board of directors of the National Coalition for the
Homeless.
   Gleason, who also heads a Denver medical clinic for homeless
people, was one of three witnesses who testified Tuesday at a
hearing for Dorothy King, who operates a shelter for homeless women
and children.
   King took 14 women and 26 children from her shelter to a vacant
house owned by the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development on Aug. 15 in an attempt to draw attention to the plight
of the homeless.
   When she refused an order to leave, King was arrested and charged
with trespassing. The other women and children obeyed the order.
   King's trial was scheduled to begin Wednesday in Denver County
Court. Tuesday's hearing before Judge Raymond N. Sater was on
several pre-trial motions.
   Sater did not rule immediately on the issues raised at the
hearing, including whether he would allow King to use the so-called
choice-of-evils defense. King's attorneys said they would argue that
trespassing was necessary to prevent the greater evil of leaving the
women and children on the streets.
   Since King's protest, HUD has rented 49 Denver-area homes to the
homeless. The site of the August protest, and the other homes that
HUD has since rented out, were obtained by the federal agency
through foreclosure proceedings when buyers who used federally
backed mortgages defaulted.
   Gleason testified Tuesday that families make up a growing
percentage of the homeless people in the Denver area.
   ``On any given night, there are 500 children in Denver who are
homeless,'' she said. She also said a recent study found 1,100
shelter beds in the Denver area, and roughly 2,100 to 2,600 people
competing for them.
   Last week, she said, two homeless men were brutally murdered, and
people have frozen to death on Denver's streets. She said it is
justified to occupy a home illegally because ``civil disobedience is
a form of public education.''
   Another witness, Gloria Roybal, who has been homeless since May,
tearfully told the court how she and her three grandchildren lived
in a park last summer. She said she slept during the day so she
could stay awake at night, watching over the children, age 3, 4 and
8.
   Marsha Gould of the Colorado Children's Campaign said a recent
study in Colorado showed children are suffering because of a lack of
attention to the problem of homeless families.
   ``We're seeing a lot of anxiety, clinging behavior in kids,
arguments, school disruption, sleep disturbance, eating disturbance,
and a lot of anxiety and depression in parents because they're
unable to care for their children,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Indiana Supreme Court on Tuesday threw
out the convictions of a habitual offender who was sentenced to 32
years in prison after he tried to get a refund for an electric razor
without a receipt.
   The court, in a 4-1 decision, struck down the attempted theft and
habitual criminal convictions of Richard Allen Smith of Indianapolis
and ordered Smith discharged from Indiana State Prison.
   Smith, 49, was sentenced to two years in prison in 1985 for
attempting to get a refund for a $42.96 Remington razor at three
Indiana stores. Under the state's habitual offender law, a fixed
term of 30 years was added to the sentence because of Smith's
earlier convictions on auto banditry and drug charges.
   Prosecutors argued at his Circuit Court trial that Smith
attempted ``to exert unauthorized control'' over one store's profit
margin by creating the false impression he had purchased the razor
there.
   However, the Supreme Court concluded that in order to prove Smith
was trying to create a false impression, the state needed to prove
Smith hadn't purchased the razor at the store. There was no evidence
to demonstrate where the razor was purchased, the court said.
   ``Without that crucial element of proof, every citizen engaging
in a simple refund transaction would risk criminal penalties,''
Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard wrote for the court. ``Some
citizens such as those seeking to return gifts simply do not know
where the item was originally purchased.''
   Court records show that in November 1978, Smith took the razor to
a Hook's Drug store in Mooresville and later to a Hook's in
Martinsville to get a refund. The package had a Hook's price tag on
it, but employees refused to give Smith a refund because of a store
policy requiring receipts for returned merchandise.
   He then went to a Danner's store in Martinsville and presented
the razor, without a price tag, for a refund. Hook's employees,
suspicious about Smith's behavior, had alerted Danner's employees of
his earlier attempts to get a refund.
   Employees at the Danner's store called police when Smith showed
up and stalled until police arrived to arrest Smith, court records
show. Danner's also would have denied a refund under its no-receipt,
no-refund policy.
   The long gap between his arrest and final sentencing occurred
because Smith left the courtroom during his trial and remained at
large for four years, according to court records.

   Japan and the Soviet Union will continue efforts to
negotiate a formal end to their World War II hostilities, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Wednesday, a day after
territorial talks broke down.
   Japanese officials indicated that all hope of a compromise
vanished in Tuesday's negotiations about the Kuril Islands north of
Japan, which Japan claims. Soviet troops occupied them in the last
days of World War II, and they have remained the major roadblock to
an official end to hostilities.
   However, Shevardnadze said Wednesday the two sides will pick up
where they left off in 1973 to negotiate a peace treaty officially
ending the war.
   Shevardnadze, speaking to a news conference shortly before
departing for the Philippines, said his talks with Japanese leaders
had brought a ``very important'' agreement on a mechanism and rough
schedule of meetings to deal with thorny issues now over four
decades old.
   The Soviet official gave a more positive assessment of his two
days of talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno than
Japanese officials gave the night before. One Japanese official
described the talks as ``heated'' and said neither side had changed
its position on the territorial dispute.
   Uno was to give a news conference later Wednesday after
Shevardnadze's departure and a joint communique was to be released
then.
   Shevardnadze agreed that no major progress was achieved. But he
cited progress in agreements on further meetings leading to a
possible summit between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   He also said the negotiations had won ``a victory for reason, for
balance of interests, and for a realistic policy.''
   ``We have obtained a degree of mutual understanding that allows
us to speak of a new chapter in Japan-Soviet relations,'' he said,
speaking in Russian that was translated into English.
   The Kiril dispute has also blocked progress in diplomatic and
economic matters between the two countries. On Tuesday, the Japanese
brushed off Soviet overtures for economic cooperation, the Kyodo
News Service reported.
   The talks in Tokyo were the first between foreign ministers in
nearly three years.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Seiichi Kondo said little progress was
achieved in the discussions, which he described as heated. ``Neither
side has shown concessions, so the positions are still far apart,''
he said.
   Also Tuesday, Japan refused to conclude two agreements, one on
bilateral investment guarantees and another on trade and economic
cooperation, the agency said, quoting government sources it did not
name.
   The ministers signed agreements on cultural exchanges and
protection of 287 species of migratory birds.
   Earlier Tuesday, Shevardnadze delivered a letter from Gorbachev
to Takeshita. The newspaper Asahi said Gorbachev invited Takeshita
to Moscow and said he would like to visit Japan.
   Shevardnadze said Wednesday the tentative agenda for a
Japan-Soviet summit would include agreements to protect investment,
principles of economic cooperation and establishment of banking
offices, as well as treaty issues and other matters.
   Shevardnadze said Moscow had established trade and other
unofficial relations with South Korea, but would not establish
governmental relations with Seoul. The Soviets are North Korea's
ally, and Moscow's growing ties with Seoul have tended to further
isolate Pyongyang.
   The Soviet foreign minister left for the Philippines, from where
he is scheduled to travel to North Korea.

   NBC signed a lease Tuesday that will keep its
corporate headquarters in New York at least until the year 2022.
   The company, which was wooed heavily by city officials last year
when it considered a plan to move to New Jersey, signed an agreement
with the owners of Rockefeller Center to remain in the landmark
Manhattan building where it has had its headquarters since 1933.
   NBC declined to reveal the terms of the lease, which expires in
2022 and gives the company the option to renew for three 10-year
periods, ending in 2052. A previous lease was due to expire in
September 1997.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch announced last December that NBC would
expand and renovate its quarters under an agreement in which the
city would provide up to $73 million in real estate tax breaks.
   The network employs more than 3,000 people at Rockefeller Center.

   The army chief and his two top
ranking generals resigned Tuesday following opposition charges that
the army commander made a deal with military rebels to end their
four-day revolt this month.
   The resignations appeared to be concessions to the mutineers and
pose military and political problems for President Raul Alfonsin as
his party campaigns for May 14 presidential elections.
   Alfonsin made no immediate public comment, but was expected to
accept the resignations of Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, the army
commander, and Gens. Miguel Abbate and Enrique Bianchi.
   Caridi met with Alfonsin for 1{ hours before announcing his
decision, the state news agency TELAM said in a terse statement on
the resignations. It gave no reasons or details for the resignations.
   Alfonsin is to address the Argentine Congress on Wednesday in a
special session focusing the Dec. 1-4 military insurrection, the
third uprising in 20 months.
   Rebels led by army Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin demanded all the
top generals go, an increased military budget including bigger pay
packets, and an end to the prosecution of officers for human rights
abuses committed during the 1976-83 military regime.
   On Dec. 3, Alfonsin ordered the army to ``suffocate'' the
rebellion. The next day, he announced the mutineers surrendered
unconditionally.
   But political opponents noted at the time that loyal troops were
reluctant to fight the rebels, that the rebels were not immediately
disarmed and that most mutineers were allowed to return to their
units.
   The opposition accused Alfonsin or Caridi of cutting a deal with
the rebels.
   Alfonsin denied making any deal. Nevertheless, a 20 percent pay
increase was granted to soldiers along with a $100 bonus.
   On Saturday, Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena said in a speech
that the so-called ``dirty war'' against leftist subversion in the
late 1970s was necessary _ effectively endorsing the army's position
and infuriating human rights groups.
   While the army did fight pitched battles with People's
Revolutionary Army guerrillas, the ``dirty war'' takes its name from
the arrests, disappearances and presumed killings of several
thousand civilians alleged to be subversives.
   Caridi was Alfonsin's fourth army chief in five years. His
predecessor, Gen. Hector Rios Erenu, departed after the first
insurrection in April 1987, which also was sparked by the human
rights trials.
   The selection of Caridi's successor is delicate. Choosing an open
supporter of Seineldin, the rebel leader, would damage Alfonsin's
credibility and the civilian government's claim that the military is
subordinate to it.
   Already, presidential candidate Carlos Menem of the opposition
Peronist Party has said he would have fired Caridi for making a deal
with the rebels.
   Caridi may have paved the way for his departure by saying in a
television interview last Friday that the insurrection ended when he
and Seineldin spoke and ``realized that our aspirations coincided.''
   ``And so the question: why confront one another to produce
bloodshed if what they (rebels) were asking, the army was trying to
achieve,'' Caridi said.
   He added that if rebels' demands were not met, there might soon
be a fourth insurrection.
   Argentina's two main political parties repeatedly have said they
would not allow Congress to pass amnesty legislation to halt the
human rights trials, which are about to resume in civilian court
after a year's lapse.

   About half a million children died in the
developing world last year because their debt-burdened governments
have had to cut back on social spending, UNICEF said today in its
annual report.
   The fiscal retreat has led to problems that overshadow the
substantial progress most developing nations made in the last decade
in health and education, the United Nations Children's Fund's
executive director, James P. Grant, says in the report.
   ``By far, the heaviest consequences are being borne by
children,'' he says in the report entitled ``The State of the
World's Children 1989''.
   Throughout most of Africa and much of Latin America, average
incomes have fallen by 10 percent to 25 percent in the 1980s, the
report says. In the 37 poorest nations, per capita spending on
health has dropped by 50 percent and on education by 25 percent over
the last few years, it adds.

   A West Virginia elector who says the nation has

the constitutional ritual officially electing George Bush as the
nation's 41st president.
   Margarette Leach switched her Democratic ballot _ voting for
Lloyd Bentsen for president and Michael Dukakis for vice president _
as she and 537 other electors carried out their constitutional duty.
   Otherwise, all voted as pledged to give Bush and Republican
running mate Dan Quayle each 426 electoral votes, far more than the
270 needed for election over Dukakis and Bentsen. The switched
ballot gave Dukakis one vote fewer than the 112 presidential
electors he earned in winning 10 states and the District of Columbia.
   ``I did it for a reason, and the reason was to make a statement
about the Electoral College,'' said Leach, a Huntington, W.Va.,

   Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Batalin told reporters in the Armenian

Tass reported.
   The new buildings will be significantly more resistant to seismic
activity than those that collapsed in the quake, the official news

   The quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, leveled the

rushing to aid the driver of a truck that struck a utility pole in
Shaftsbury, in southwest Vermont. As his family watched from their
vehicle, 7,200 volts of electricity pulsed through Paquin's body.
   His sister, Alice, revived him and rescue crews delivered him to
the Albany, N.Y., Medical Center partially paralyzed, with serious
internal injuries and burns on his neck and knees.

<HEAD>Ban Santa, Pastor Urges, Doubtlessly Igniting Objections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Every once in a while, some brave soul ventures
forth to demand: ``Get rid of Santa Claus!'' A chorus of protests
inevitably results in various quarters, religious and otherwise.
   It has happened again. This time, the Santa-smashing thrust comes
from a minister in Kansas.
   ``Santa Claus should be abolished from the celebration of
Christmas,'' says the Rev. Milton M. Miller, pastor of First United
Methodist Church in Girard, Kan. ``He should be discarded with last
year's gift wrappings.''
   After all, it's not his birthday, but that of Jesus, Miller says,
yet ``it is always Santa Claus who receives the most attention
during the Christmas season.
   ``His face and portly figure appear on the majority of holiday
decorations and greetings.''
   Miller hoists his challenge in The United Methodist Reporter, a
national denominational weekly published in Dallas, declaring that
Santa has virtually ``become a god!''
   Anything ``that takes the place of God is an idol,'' he adds,
suggesting that's the kind of false substitute being worshipped at
Christmas.
   Furthermore, he says it engenders some shoddy impulses in the
young, both selfishness for things and eventual disillusionment that
the whole affair is unreal, a fantasy perpetrated by adults.
   ``Santa Claus inspires greed,'' Miller says. ``We all have seen
little children pushing and shoving in line preparing to tell Santa
what they want...
   ``I have witnessed the sanctuary of a church turn into a madhouse
because of the arrival of the man in the red suit as children and
adults wait for their names to be called to receive their gifts.''
   Besides that, the Santa myth is ``cloaked in untruths,'' Miller
points out, and the child eventually learns ``it was all a fake.. .
   ``There should be no dishonesty associated with such a beautiful
holiday. Jesus came to be the truth. Such a lovely story does not
need to be surrounded by untruths.''
   The argument sometimes is made that Santa is proper for the
occasion because children need something ``they can see,'' Miller
notes.
   He says this is the same explanation given Moses when he
descended from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments and found the
Israelites worshipping the golden calf, viz.: ``The people wanted
something they could see.''
   Miller adds, ``The argument that Santa Claus is the `spirit of
love' leads me to ask, `Then where does that leave Jesus? Isn't he
the spirit of love?'''
   As for reactions from Miller's congregation when he once ``put my
foot down'' and ordered Santa eliminated, he says it was the adults,
not the children, who complained.
   ``Children love the thought of the baby in the manger and they,
with wide-eyued innocence, love to worship him,'' Miller adds.
``They don't need something to take his place.''
   Nevertheless, efforts to oust Santa almost always have produced
resistance and repercussions, as was the case in the 1986 season
when a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Romano Ferraro, told a
children's class Santa didn't exist.
   When asked by a fifth-grader at St. John Vianney Church in
Colonia, N.J., if that meant parents were liars, Ferraro said yes, a
parent reported. The episode brought apologies from Ferraro's church
superiors, saying:
   His ``zeal to emphasize the spiritual dimensions'' of the
occasion unfortunately ``appeared to diminish the importance that
many, especially children, attach to some of the cultural and
secular aspects.''
   It's a touchy issue, with some church leaders deploring the
extent to which Santa diverts attention from Jesus, while others
defend the Santa myth, so long the main emphasis is on Jesus's birth.
   In any case, old and young generally treat Santa as a charming
fellow and lot of fun, immune to stuffy analysis.
   Counter to Miller's call for ouster of Santa, another United
Methodist pastor, the Rev. James Campbell of Davenport, Iowa, writes
in an earlier issue of the United Methodist Reporter:
   ``I'm beginning to wonder if Bethlehem is really as far from the
North Pole as we make it... If he (Santa) were made for children, he
was born in the mind of adults, in the spirit, the yearning, the
brokenness, the hopes of adults.
   ``He is, in all of this commercial, earthy, secular,
materialistic and often corny glory, something of a prayer in
disguise...
   ``He is our yearning and our question, the question of Christmas
_ `Is there anyone there beyond ourselves? And if you are there, do
you really care?' As Christians ... we profess to have heard God's
answer...
   ``We claim it. We retell it, the story that Christ is born, and
born again.'' The light of that story can reach into the silent
darkness of others' yearnings and suffering, Campbell says, perhaps
heard in the words, ``Yes, Santa ... there is a God.''

   Christmas services provide an opportunity to draw
alienated Catholics back into regular worship, but priests tend to
``ridicule and demean'' them for attending so infrequently, says the
Rev. Andrew Greeley.
   Writing in U.S. Catholic, published by the Claretian Fathers, the
noted priest-sociologist-novelist says:
   ``One of the more twisted and sick kinks in clerical culture is
the propensity to ridicule and demean the `Christmas Catholics' and,
even when priests are on their best behavior, to patronize them.''
   Greeley says ``Christmas Catholics,'' who show up only on such
holidays, often are alienated from the church, having been hurt or
confused by it, and they ``need to know there's room for them in the
inn, too.''
   He adds, ``Welcoming the alienated and inviting them to come home
and stay home permanently is surely far more in the spirit of
Christmas than brutalizing them again.''

   An American ``Pastors for Peace''
convoy of trucks and humanitarian aid for Nicaraguans was expected
to reach the capital of Managua in time to celebrate Christmas.
   About 46 persons, Protestants and Roman Catholic, most of them
pastors from various parts of the country, driving about 20 trucks,
converged here last week before heading through Mexico.
   The trucks range from a 10-ton, 22-foot rig to pickups, some of
them loaded with medical supplies, rice, typewriters and other
materials for the war-damaged country.
   The project is sponsored by the Interreligious Foundation for
Community Organization. Spokesmen said the trucks are particularly
needed to get crops to market and provide transportation to medical
facilities.

<HEAD>HBO's `Dead Solid Perfect' a Solid Good Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Your football team punted the playoffs, relatives
are descending for the holidays and network TV is cluttered with
junk.
   'Tis the season to give thanks that you paid your cable bill. For
HBO has a nice little out-of-season movie this month, ``Dead Solid
Perfect,'' an adaptation of Dan Jenkins' novel of the same name
about life on the links. What better time of year to be delivered
from gray winter landscapes to the land of greens, fairways,
sandtraps and perpetual short sleeves?
   ``Dead Solid Perfect'' is dead solid funny and a nice little love
story to boot. It premiered last week, but you can still catch it
tonight, Friday and next Tuesday.
   Kenny Lee (Randy Quaid) is a diamond-in-the-rough golfer,
hustling bets on the side so he can afford to get to the next
tournament.
   Enter Hubert ``Bad Hair'' Wimberly (Jack Warden), a hustler with
more money than he knows what to do with, but a nasty slice he'll
never be able to buy off. So he buys Kenny, becoming his sponsor on
the tour.
   Exit Beverly (Kathryn Harrold), Kenny's intelligent wife, tired
of hanging out with jerks like Bad Hair and dragging herself around
the country to watch Kenny cuss and sling golf clubs in disgust.
   Forget ``Caddyshack.'' This is the definitive golf movie of the
'80s. Director Bobby Roth, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jenkins,
does for the links what Martin Scorsese did for pool in ``The Color
of Money.'' Roth and Jenkins successfully teamed on ``Baja
Oklahoma'' for HBO earlier this year.
   The music is by Tangerine Dream, and the theme song is sung by
Billy Vera.
   Larry Riley co-stars as Spec, Kenny's caddy, a talented golfer
himself who stays in the background rather than challenge the racism
of the sponsorship game. At one point, as Kenny is preparing for a
big tournament, Spec warns Bad Hair, ``Give him one word of advice,
and I'll burn down your mansion and marry your daughter.''
   Brett Cullen plays Kenny's friend, Donny Smithern, a successful
young pro who gets recognized in restaurants, cheats on his good ol'
gal wife (DeLane Matthews) and waxes phony pious in TV interviews.
   Jenkins is one of a handful of male authors around who can write
realistic women. He gives his female characters a sense of humor
without making them just sound like men. ``Good ol' Donny,'' Beverly
sneers at one point, ``he'll always be there when he needs you.''
   After Beverly leaves Kenny, he takes up with Janie (Corinne
Bohrer), a bimbo savant who chucks her job as a bartender to
accompany him on the tour. At first, he plays well, and it's party
time. But Kenny warns Janie during an R-rated romp in their hotel
room. ``It's not always this fun. Sometimes I play bad.'' ``So do
I,'' Janie says.
   Kenny starts playing really badly after he gets shook up by
running into Beverly and a new beau at a restaurant. Janie gamely
tries to trade insults with Beverly and spews a blue streak.
Observes Beverly, ``Why, you didn't tell me she talked like Princess
Di.''
   Eventually, the film veers off into a standard-issue plotline
about a tumor and Kenny's big show-down with Donny on the 18th hole
of the U.S. Open. But if the story is predictable, it's also
satisfying, because Jenkins' characters are immensely likable, and
Roth's direction is, like Kenny's play _ for those brief shining
moments just dead solid perfect.

   Elsewhere in television:
   BOUNCING `BABY BOOM' _ Just when ``Baby Boom'' started turning
into a pretty decent little show about upscale working women, NBC
announced the series was going on hiatus. ``Baby Boom'' will remain
in production, but is leaving the schedule until further notice. NBC
did like the new shows ``Dear John,'' ``Empty Nest,'' ``Day by
Day,'' ``In the Heat of the Night'' and ``Midnight Caller'' enough,
however, to give them full-season orders. A decision about the fate
of low-rated ``Tattinger's'' is expected soon. The show has had
trouble finding a niche, but it will no doubt get another chance,
since it is made by the producers of NBC's critically acclaimed
ex-series ``St. Elsewhere.'' According to NBC, the network and
producers are considering options that include shortening
``Tattinger's'' from an hour to a half-hour. ...
   RELIEF STILL NEEDED _ Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin
Williams are teaming up for a third ``Comic Relief'' on HBO next
March. HBO says the two previous ``Comic Relief'' benefits combined
to raise $4.7 million to aid the homeless. Once again, an 800 number
will enable viewers to contribute. ...
   RESETTING THEIR ALARM CLOCKS _ Robb Weller, host of ABC's
``Home'' information show, will fill in for vacationing Charlie
Gibson on ``Good Morning America'' next week. Gibson will also be
out the week of Jan. 9, and sitting in will be ``Today'' veteran Joe
Garagiola.

   Deep in the basement of the New England Aquarium a
seal named Goofy lounges in his private tank, taking a casual glance
at observers before rolling belly-up, inches below the water's
surface.
   Outside, in nippy 30-degree temperatures, 3{-year-old Rigel darts
about his pool, twirling splashy pirouettes and barking ``Hi'' in
return for a steady supply of fish.
   Rigel and Goofy enjoy safe harbor at the aquarium, just two of
the sick, orphaned or stranded animals taken in under a marine
mammal rescue program that began 15 years ago.
   ``In terms of a job, it's a real satisfying sort of thing,'' said
Greg Early, the program's supervisor.
   Goofy was picked up on a Danvers beach this fall. Rigel was an
orphan found in Maine about two years ago. He was released once but
didn't take to the wild.
   ``He was a young orphan pup raised on seal formula and weaned on
to fish. He was released up in Maine, and about a day or two later
he showed up on a beach,'' Early said.
   Volunteers recall how Rigel, identified by tags, crawled onto a
beach blanket in the middle of a crowd and, when placed on the front
floorboards of a truck, climbed up onto the seat and went to sleep.
   ``We brought him back in and said it seems like Rigel wants to
stay here,'' Early said.
   This year, the aquarium has picked up more than 150 animals,
Early said, many sick or injured and most of them already dead.
Seals are the most common animals rescued, but from October to
January the focus is on whales, which often strand themselves on
Cape Cod beaches.
   The aquarium now has four residents of the program: a sea turtle
chewed up by a shark and three seals. About 50 percent of the seals
found survive and are returned to the wild or sent to zoos, Early
said.
   Harbor seals, which grow to about 5 feet and can weigh 220
pounds, usually keep to secluded beaches, rocky reefs and mud flats.
Since they spend part of their time on land, they don't really get
stranded, but when they're ill they often stay out of the water for
unusually long periods.
   Goofy, who appears satisfied to stay in his pool and be fed more
than 15 pounds of food a day, is a likely zoo candidate because he
seems to lack the fortitude to survive in the wild, Early said.
   When he was picked up, ``he was very, very docile which for a
harbor seal is not normal,'' Early said.
   Rigel, named after the brightest star in the constellation of
Orion, is working on an appropriately stellar career at the
aquarium's seal pool. Many male seals vocalize, particularly around
mating season, but Rigel can bark a creditable ``Hi'' on command and
splashes around the pool to show off to passers-by.
   ``We're working on teaching Rigel hello,'' said Jenny Montague,
supervisor of seal training. ``He is actually kind of a ham.''

<HEAD>Rockettes Fall Down in Style During `The Parade of the Wooden
Soldiers'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hard part of falling down is getting up.
   Violet Holmes should know. She's the woman who supervises the
domino-like descent of 36 Rockettes in ``The Parade of the Wooden
Soldiers,'' one of the most popular production numbers at Radio City
Music Hall's annual Christmas show.
   ``It's very difficult,'' says Holmes, a former Rockette who now
directs the high-kicking dance line at New York's famous art deco
entertainment palace. ``You can't just bend and get yourself up in
stiff, starched pants. The girls turn around and help each other
up.''
   The five-minute dance is a precision military march done by the
Rockettes dressed as toy wooden soldiers. It ends with a cannon shot
_ a puff of smoke that knocks over the line of dancers. They fall,
one by one, on top of each other. And the audience cheers.
   ``The fall has to be done just right,'' Holmes says. ``You have
to hold the girl in front of you, bringing her to you. As she falls
back, you have to fall back to the girl behind you. You have to make
sure your legs are straight and that your arms are open, so that the
girl behind you, catches you. If they don't, the whole thing will
slide right down.''
   The march was choreographed originally by Russell Markert who
founded the Rockettes in 1932 when Radio City opened.
   Markert had formed other high-kicking, precision kick lines. He
started with the St. Louis Rockets in 1925, moved them to New York
for a part in the 1928 musical hit ``Rain or Shine,'' and then to
the Roxy Theater where they were know as the Roxyettes. It was at
the Roxy that Markert first choreographed ``The Parade of the Wooden
Soldiers.''
   Radio City beckoned four years later, and the line, with the name
Rockettes, has been there ever since. So have those wooden soldiers,
with Holmes supervising the march every year. It's one of the
highlights of the Christmas show which will be on view through Jan.
4.
   How do you teach someone to fall?
   ``Slooow-ly,'' says Holmes. She usually begins by teaching it in
sections of 10 or 12 dancers lined up in a row. The others watch,
and they all get pointers from dancers who have done the number
before.
   ``A march of any kind is very difficult to teach,'' Holmes says.
``The lines have to be perfect because it's so obvious if one girl
sticks out. It's the guiding and keeping straight lines and walking
with straight knees, not bent knees, in stiff, starched pants.''
   Sometimes, the line has dancers who think that if they hold the
fall a little bit, it's going to help the weight,'' Holmes adds. It
doesn't.
   If the fall starts and the line is crooked, there's nothing a
dancer can do to correct it. ``It's like you're in midair,'' Holmes
says.
   There have been injuries over the years, although none serious,
the director says. ``If properly done, the number is not
dangerous,'' she adds.
   The first girl who falls has the easiest job. It's the last
dancer who has it tough, even though she collapses on a big, fat
pillow.
   ``She's waiting and looking at these 36 girls coming at her,''
Holmes says. ``That's frightening. And you don't know how fast the
fall is going to come. It can come very easily or like a whip.''
   The fall is supposed to go easily, smoothly and slowly.
   ``You are not supposed to look out and down because that would
throw the line crooked. They should only look at the girl's head
right in front of them,'' she says. ``So you anticipate, but you
don't know what you're anticipating because you can't see anything.''
   The parade has been modified slightly over the years. At some
Christmas shows, the soldiers came down a ramp from a castle or out
of sentry boxes. Today, the Rockettes just march out from the wings
of the large stage. Still, what audiences see at Radio City is much
of the original version, according to Holmes, although she has cut
it by two minutes to fit more smoothly into the Hall's current
90-minute Christmas extravaganza.
   The director has her own charts and notes to guide her through
the restaging. But she doesn't need them.
   ``After all these years, you know it by heart,'' she says. ``You
don't have to consult your notes anymore. Besides, I've tried to
keep it the same. Why change anything that is so successful?''

<HEAD>Peronists on the Move Again in Argentina</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peronist Party, implanted in
Argentina as the voice of the workers and the poor by Juan D. Peron
and his wife Eva four decades ago, is in a resurgence it hopes will
bring victory in presidential elections set for May.
   It has been out of power for 12 years.
   Virtually every poll gives Peronist Carlos Saul Menem, a colorful
provincial governor, a commanding lead over the candidate of the
governing Radical Civic Union, Eduardo Angeloz.
   Provincial and congressional elections last year reversed
Peronist setbacks in 1983, when civilian government was restored
after nearly eight years of military dictatorship during which
Peronist politicians, including Menem, were jailed, Peronist
teachers were dismissed from universities and labor leaders were
arrested and executed.
   In September 1987, Peronist candidates swept 17 of the country's
22 provinces, including Buenos Aires, the biggest. The party's
inroads in the House of Deputies eliminated the Radical's majority.
   ``In 1983, it wasn't Alfonsin against Luder, it was the Radicals
against the Peronists,'' losing candidate Italo Argentino Luder said
in an interview, referring to Raul Alfonsin. Alfonsin swamped Luder,
52 percent to 40 in the balloting for president in post-military
Argentina.
   ``Now, it is totally different,'' the 71-year-old Luder said.
``The economy is the biggest theme _ inflation, foreign debt,
growth, employment, purchasing power ... (and) the Radicals have
totally failed in government.''
   Pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo's surveys consistently give Menem
twice as big a share of the vote as Angeloz, though he notes that
undecideds have crept up to 35 percent.
   ``You can't say (Menem's) victory is beyond doubt, but he's
definitely ahead,'' the pollster said.
   Peron founded the party following his victory in the elections of
1946, the most honest and widely attended in two decades.
   An army colonel at the time, Peron later was promoted by Congress
to general. With his wildly popular and politically astute wife Eva
at his side and sometimes acting on her own, Peron won the support
of workers disenfranchised by previous conservative governments.
   Peron industrialized an agricultural economy based on grain and
beef, nationalized industries, promoted such legislation as
collective bargaining and pensions, vastly extended public education
and health services, and gave women the right to vote.
   Peron established a dictatorship that remained popular so long as
Eva _ Evita, as she was affectionately known _ was around. Popular
support began to diminish after her death of cancer in 1952 and with
the economy in trouble in 1955 the military overthrew Peron and sent
him into exile in Spain.
   He made a triumphal return in 1971 and was elected president
again in 1973, with his new wife, Isabel, as his vice president. She
took the presidency upon Peron's death in 1974 only to be ousted by
the military two years later.
   While the Perons themselves have had their ups and downs, the
party has generally maintained its base of organized labor and the
poor.
   The 4-million-member General Workers Confederation, the chief
labor union, ``was born, is and will always be Peronist,'' the
53-year-old Menem told a recent rally.
   But party leaders now are trying to appeal to the middle class,
which they see as key to the 50 percent of the vote required by
Argentine law to win the election outright and avoid a runoff in the
Electoral College.
   Luder, an attorney who is one of Menem's advisers, says appealing
to the middle class is a natural move.
   ``Peronism created this country as we know it today,'' he said.
``The sons and grandsons of the workers of 1946 today are
businessmen, teachers, professionals.''
   Argentines in those stations, however, tend to support the
Radical Civic Union or the conservative Union of the Democratic
Center of Alvaro Alsogaray, a former economy minister and former
U.S. ambassador.
   Today's Peronists are finding their overtures frustrated by the
party's image of violence, demagoguery and administrative
incompetence, a public perception Menem calls his party's ``black
legend.''
   Even triple-digit inflation, rising unemployment, stagnant growth
and three military insurrections under President Alfonsin cannot
shake the recollections of better-off Argentines that some of the
country's economic and political low points occurred under Peronist
governments.
   Peron squandered huge gold reserves built up during World War II,
crowded out private business by expanding the state's role in the
economy, made public employment conditional on party membership,
tolerated corruption and thuggery against his opponents, closed down
newspapers, antagonized the Roman Catholic Church.
   In the final months before Isabel Peron was ousted by the
military in 1976, Argentina was torn by murderous street violence,
out-of-control inflation and paralyzing strikes.
   ``Peronist governments have never understood economics,'' said
Juan Balassoni, a medical products importer. ``It's very possible he
(Menem) would return control to the unions, so the unions would
govern, not the government.''
   A well-dressed, middle-aged woman at a rally for Alsogaray in a
downtown sports stadium said, ``If Menem wins, the country will
slide backwards, despite his best intentions. ... I favor shrinking
the size of the state, selling state companies. The Peronists would
never sell state companies.''
   National elections set for May 14 may hang in the balance of
opinions like theirs. Votes in the Electoral College are tied to the
popular ballot. If Menem fails to win at least 50 percent, Alsogaray
could determine the election by throwing his support to Angeloz.
   Menem at times seems to hurt his own cause by endorsing ideas
that appear contradictory and are never fully explained.
   Although Argentina is a country notorious for tax evasion, Menem
has said he would curtail the fiscal deficit not by cutting back
state employment or selling off money-losing state enterprises, but
by cutting tax rates in the hope that would spur compliance and
generate additional revenue.
   Under his program, workers would receive big wage increases, but
he has not fully explained where the money would come from.
   Menem's allies don't always help.
   While he tries to project an image of moderation and
statesmanship, Mrs. Peron in November dredged up unhappy memories by
endorsing an amnesty for the former military chiefs who directed the
so-called ``dirty war'' against subversives and the leftist
Montonero urban guerrillas in the 1970s.
   At least 8,900 Argentines were arrested and ``disappeared''
during that campaign. Forced to take a position on that sensitive
issue, Menem said he opposed an amnesty.
   In another case, the leader of a leftist Peronist splinter group,
Pablo Unamuno, publicly stated that Menem would pardon Mario
Firmenich, the Montonero leader who is in prison for murder,
extortion and kidnapping. An angry Menem denied he planned any such
pardon and suspended Unamuno from the party.
   The Radicals have seized upon such rifts and gaffes to fan
passions and fears that are never far from the surface in this
politically polarized country.
   ``Violence is part of their history,'' said Angeloz's press
secretary, Oscar Fernandez Soares. ``The Peronist Party still has
violent elements in its structure.''

<HEAD>Salinas Starts Furor Over Church-State Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has kicked
a political hornet's nest by suggesting the Roman Catholic Church,
technically illegal in Mexico since 1917, be restored to normal
status.
   The constitution ratified in that year by the triumphant forces
of the Mexican revolution went beyond separation of church and
state. It denied the church legal existence and tried to eliminate
church influence.
   Mexico remains the most Catholic country in the hemisphere
nonetheless, and the church has not faded. Every year, millions of
people take part in public processions to the Basilica of the Virgin
of Guadalupe, the country's patron saint.
   Salinas acknowledged reality by declaring in his inaugural speech
Dec. 1 that a ``modern state deals openly and modernizes its
relationship with unions, business groups, news organizations ...
and the church.''
   It was the first time in modern Mexico a president publicly
acknowledged the church as part of society. Sitting in the gallery
for the first time were representatives of the church: Cardinal
Ernesto Corripio Ahumada, four other bishops and Papal Nuncio
Girolamo Prigione, the pope's ambassador.
   Church leaders welcomed the move and conservative parties said
they favored a debate to redefine the church's role. Critics said
the government should stick to the constitution.
   Salinas' Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has controlled
the government since it was founded 60 years ago, was torn between
supporting him and loyalty to the constitution's framers.
   Congresswoman Socorro Diaz said: ``The reopening of a debate
settled by history ... does not strengthen national unity and
creates disagreement and confrontation among Mexicans.'' She is
director of El Dia, a newspaper sponsored by the party's left wing.
   Some saw the president's move as an effort to widen support for
his government while his party is losing traditional backing from
labor and the middle class.
   The issue does divide the opposition. During a debate in
Congress, conservatives shouted ``Fanatic!'' ``Robespierre!'' and
``Son of Lenin!'' at left-wing members who opposed the reassessment.
   An officially anti-clerical government leading a largely Catholic
population is one of Mexico's contradictions. The government ignores
technical violations of the law by the church in order to maintain
social peace.
   One paragraph in Article 130 of the constitution says: ``The law
does not recognize the religious associations known as churches.''
   In the eyes of the peasant, union and military revolutionaries
who wrote it, the church was part of an oppressive landowning
establishment. To the hierarchy, they were godless destroyers of
established order.
   Churches cannot own property and the government has the power to
determine the number of priests in each state. Foreign priests are
prohibited from working in Mexico and public displays of religion
are forbidden.
   Priests do not have the right to vote, but do so. They are not
allowed to speak or write about politics or the government, but
write opinion columns. They are barred from teaching, but the
Catholic Church runs schools and universities where the children of
government leaders study.
   Presidents hold private meetings with bishops.
   Two million people attended a Mass in Mexico City conducted by
Pope John Paul II. He spent a week in Mexico during his first trip
to America.
   In the late 1920s, Catholics conducted the Cristero revolt
because of government persecution. A church hero was the Rev. Miguel
Pro, a Jesuit priest executed by the government, who was beatified
in November.
   A few days after the Salinas inaugural, Interior Minister
Fernando Gutierrez Barrios caused front-page headlines by declaring:
``The church exists,'' and since then the debate has covered acres
of newsprint.
   In Congress, Popular Socialist Party member Alfredo Reyes
Contreras said even the presence of prelates at the inauguration had
violated the Mexican constitution. He demanded an investigation.
   A leader of the Unified Socialist Party, Gilberto Rincon
Gallardo, a Catholic, said change is needed because the current
situation ``stimulates fanaticism.''
   The Popular and Unified Socialist parties both belong to the
Democratic Front coalition that supported Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
against Salinas in the July 6 presidential election.
   Salinas should be able to get the two-thirds vote he needs in
Congress to change the constitution, if he wants to do so. His party
controls 60 of 64 Senate seats, and although it has only 260 of 500
lower house seats it can expect support from the conservative
National Action Party's 101 members.

<HEAD>Treatment Center Says Doctors Present at Torturings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUNILLA FARINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients at Inge Kemp Genefke's clinic
for torture victims say their injuries often were inflicted in the
presence of doctors, nurses or psychologists _ people trained to
heal.
   The Danish physician said it has become clear during six years of
treating battered refugees and studying torture cases that medical
personnel nearly always were involved, even if only giving tacit
assent.
   In a well-documented case in Uruguay, a prison psychologist
advised torturers on how to break victims.
   Studies by the clinic indicate up to 25,000 people in the medical
profession are involved.
   ``Torture could not take place to the extent it does today if
doctors were not implicated,'' the doctor said. ``These doctors
should be thrown out of medical organizations, and not only in their
own country.''
   Dr. Genefke is director of the International Rehabilitation and
Research Center for Torture Victims. It treats victims, publishes
educational material, trains doctors and psychologists in the care
of victims and conducts courses for police and others who deal with
refugees.
   It is private and independent, financed by the government and
private donations.
   Her study of torture started 15 years ago, when Dr. Genefke was
in a group of physicians asked by the Amnesty International human
rights group to examine victims for evidence of torture.
   She opened the center in 1982 in a wing of University Hospital in
Copenhagen and has helped establish similar facilities in the United
States, the Philippines, Norway and elsewhere. The Copenhagen clinic
has a staff of 30 doctors, psychologists and others who treat 70-100
victims and families every year.
   The 1988 Right Livelihood Award was given to Dr. Genefke. Baron
Jakob von Uexkull established the prize in 1980 for humanitarian
work.
   Estimates by the center indicate 30 percent of the approximately
24,000 people given asylum in Denmark have been exposed to torture.
   ``We used to believe that medical personnel participating in
torture was a rare phenomenon, but now we know that almost all
torture victims have been in contact with them in the actual torture
process,'' said Peter Vesti, a staff psychiatrist.
   ``Today we know the purpose of torture is not to get information,
but to destroy the personality and spread terror to control the
population.''
   In 1986, the center broadened its scope to include research and
documentation on torture, in cooperation with doctors in Latin
America and Europe.
   An international committee has been formed to expose illegal
practices and revoke licenses of doctors involved with torture.
Amnesty International has estimated torture is practiced in at least
90 countries.
   ``In Uruguay and in Chile, the medical associations have been
extremely brave and courageous,'' Dr. Genefke said.
   Several hundred military doctors are believed involved in torture
in each of those countries, the center has reported. Dr. Francisco
Rivas, former director of Chile's medical association, told The
Associated Press in Santiago four doctors had been expelled and two
suspended from membership.
   ``They are a really astounding example of how national medical
associations can deal with this issue,'' Eric Stover of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science said in a telephone
interview.
   ``Not only have they disciplined physicians while the Pinochet
government is in power, they have adopted a set of guidelines for
physicians.''
   Stover said Chile's was a unique case of a medical association
acting against doctors involved in torture while a military
government remained in power.
   In Uruguay, where democracy was restored in 1985, the ethics
board of the physicians' union imposed sanctions on four doctors,
including Eduardo Saiz, found to have issued a death certificate in
1984 that concealed evidence of torture.
   All four continue practicing medicine in Uruguay, however. About
200 doctors have given depositions about their activities under the
military dictatorship that began in 1973, but action has been taken
only against Saiz and the other three.
   In Brazil last March, the Regional Council of Medicine revoked
the license of Amilcar Lobo, an army doctor who attended torture
sessions in 1970-1974. Brazilian press reports say Lobo has
implicated other doctors but no formal charges have resulted.
   Emilie Trautmann of Amnesty International, said the Turkish
Medical Association was investigating charges in that country.
   Dr. Genefke said the involvement of medical people in torture can
take many forms: ``For example, a doctor can examine a prisoner and
conclude that he or she has a weak heart and should not have
electrical torture, because they are not supposed to die.''
   She also said psychological torture, often involving threats, can
be worse than physical punishment.
   Her center has done extensive research on torture methods in
order to develop the most effective medical and psychological care
for victims. Most are treated as outpatients.
   Treatment at the center combines physiotherapy, psychotheraphy
and social counseling. It usually lasts 10 to 12 months.
   The clinic decor is cheerful and the atmosphere friendly. Beige
and yellow furniture and flowered textiles are used to reduce the
resemblance to a medical institution.
   Patients report such tortures as hanging by hands or elbows,
sometimes for days; electric shocks; beatings, amd holding the head
under filthy water.
   Long afterward, patients often have such symptoms as sexual
disturbance, hallucinations, fear, confusion, nightmares and loss of
self-confidence and self-respect, Vesti said.
   As Dr. Genefke explained it: ``There is so much fear, anger,
aggressions, shame and guilt that has to be expressed, and it is
very, very difficult. We don't call our patients torture victims, we
call them torture survivors.''

   Almost from the minute he takes the presidential oath Jan. 20,
George Bush will face a raft of fast-developing foreign policy
issues in a world that has changed radically from the one Ronald
Reagan found eight years before.
   Most immediately pressing, perhaps, is the Middle East, where the
United States could be on the verge of its first major involvement
in a peace effort since Henry A. Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy of
the 1970s.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's changing Soviet Union and more U.S.-Soviet
arms agreements also are likely items on the agenda for the early
days of the Bush presidency.
   Then there is China and its new contacts with Moscow; Europe,
where the East is at a crossroads, and the West looks with less
trepidation toward the Soviet bloc; Latin America, with its debt and
economic stagnation; Africa, where South African apartheid remains a
troublesome and delicate issue for the White House; and Asia, where
burgeoning economies still pour goods into Main Street, U.S.A.
   Even the South Pacific, the place people dream of for tranquil
escape, has become a piece in the world chess game.
   Each year at this time, The Associated Press asks its
correspondents in strategic areas of the world to look ahead to what
Americans can expect abroad in the new year.
   For 1989, they were asked to look ahead to what President Bush
can expect in his first year in office.
   These are their reports:

   George Bush inherits a rapidly changing
climate in the Middle East, where a U.S. dialogue with the PLO holds
the seeds of a possible breakthrough in settling the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   The Reagan administration's decision Dec. 14 to talk to the
Palestine Liberation Organization after its chairman, Yasser Arafat,
said the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism, will give Bush the opportunity to make a significant
impact on the long-stalled peace process.
   Whatever the outcome of the U.S.-PLO dialogue, it will put
pressure on Israel, appalled at the U.S. decision, to negotiate with
the PLO on the creation of a Palestinian state declared in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip by the PLO's Parliament-in-exile.
   With Israel increasingly isolated, Bush could be in a position to
encourage Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to be more flexible. But
there will likely be hard bargaining amid Arab, Soviet and European
pressure for an international peace conference attended by the PLO.
   Bush will also find new possibilities for resuming relations with
Iran under the Islamic republic's developing open-door policy of
improving its ties with the rest of the world, ending nine years of
political isolation.
   That could improve the prospects of freeing Western hostages in
Lebanon. Most of the 16 foreigners, including nine Americans, are
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists.

   In less than four years, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
painted over the image of the Soviet Union as a boastful,
missile-wielding totalitarian state with a portrait of a hopeful
giant struggling to pull itself up by the bootstraps and join the
community of peaceful nations.
   But the Soviet Union still has those missiles, and if President
Bush is to continue a period of easing world tensions, he must find
some way to break the deadlock that prevented his predecessor from
signing an agreement with Gorbachev to slash strategic arsenals in
half.
   The initial roadblock remains President Reagan's ``Star Wars''
program to develop a space-based defense against missile attack.
Gorbachev insists such a program only opens a new, dangerous arena
for the arms race and makes reductions in offensive weapons
impossible. Beyond that lie unresolved questions about how the two
sides can fairly balance reductions in their inherently different
land, sea and air weapons systems.
   Gorbachev is busy not only trying to restructure the economy and
way of thinking in his own country, but he also is trying to break
down East-West barriers and develop new trade relationships
throughout the world. The United States has moved more slowly than
some nations in Asia and Western Europe to encourage an end to
Soviet isolation and support development of a potentially powerful
new Soviet market.
   Some Westerners have suggested the Kremlin's efforts to improve
relations, particularly with West Germany, could weaken U.S. ties to
its NATO partners as Gorbachev works to build what he calls a
``common European home.''

   In Eastern Europe, George Bush
faces a delicate balancing act between Communist authorities opening
up to reform and the increasingly vocal and active independent
groups who want the West to insist on more human rights.
   As in the Soviet Union, Communist governments in Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are realizing they must open up to
economic and perhaps political reform in order to modernize outmoded
industry and keep consumer demands satisfied.
   East Germany and Romania, for the time being, have rejected any
need for the change their allies have embraced with varying degrees
of enthusiasm.
   But new laws allowing more private and foreign investment in East
bloc economies will not boost output unless the West agrees to make
large loans and import or sell its advanced technology.
   Some West European leaders have talked of a kind of ``Marshall
Plan'' to help out Eastern Europe, where massive investment would be
needed to provide modern housing and industry and clean up the
heavily polluted environment.
   But independent groups encouraged by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union are also placing increasing
demands for genuine democracy.
   U.S. trade with Eastern Europe traditionally has been small. But
Bush will have a voice in determining the stand of allies like West
Germany, with significant business activities in the East, as they
try to juggle the demands of Communists for more money and activists
for a firm stand on human rights.

   President-elect Bush will find a Western
Europe preoccupied with contentious arms control talks, efforts to
unify its market and a continuing flirtation with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush will likely meet in the spring with West European leaders at
a summit of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
discuss pressing issues.
   By that time, the NATO allies may well have begun negotiations _
called the Conventional Stability Talks _ with the seven Warsaw Pact
nations on reducing conventional arms in Europe.
   The allies recently unveiled their joint position, which calls
for substantial reductions in the East bloc's tanks, artillery and
other forces, surpassing the unilateral cuts promised by Gorbachev
in a surprise announcement at the United Nations in New York in
early December. NATO contends the Warsaw Pact holds a massive
superiority in such weapons.

   A fresh push will likely be made to wrap up negotiations with the
Soviet Union on reducing long-range nuclear weapons. In December,
1987, President Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty which provides for eliminating all U.S. and
Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   The Bush administration also will closely monitor the moves of
the 12-nation European Economic Community, or Common Market, to form
a single market by the end of 1992. That's when the nations are to
remove many of the trade barriers separating them.
   U.S. officials worry _ despite repeated denials by Europeans _
that the unifying moves will cause Western Europe to turn inward,
possibly erecting barriers to goods from the United States.

   China and the Soviet Union are expected to hold
their first summit in 30 years by mid-1989, ending a rift that
drastically reshaped the strategic thinking of the world powers.
   The Reagan administration stressed it welcomed the easing of
tensions between the two giants and expressed faith in Chinese
assertions they will never return to the relationship of the 1950s
when Beijing was a subservient ally of Moscow.
   But George Bush, a former U.S. ambassador to China, will need to
take a new look at how China figures in American strategic interests
when Mikhail S. Gorbachev's meeting with Deng Xiaoping formally
makes America's ``China card'' obsolete.
   U.S.-Chinese relations based on shared antipathy to Soviet
policies have long been overshadowed by more substantially binding
ties. Total trade for 1988 is expected to reach $12 billion and
continues to grow. U.S. businesses have invested $3 billion in
China's modernization drive. Scientific, military and cultural
exchanges are everyday occurrences, and thousands of Chinese study
at American universities and research centers.
   The Bush administration must decide how far to push China to play
a larger role in ending the war in Cambodia. China provides arms and
political support to the Khmer Rouge, the strongest faction in the
anti-Vietnamese coalition in Cambodia. Vietnam insists the
withdrawal of its troops hinges on assurances the Khmer Rouge,
blamed for the deaths of 1 million Cambodians when they ruled in the
1970s, not return to power.
   The end of the Iran-Iraq War in the Middle East eased
U.S.-Chinese tensions over Chinese arms sales to Iran. However,
China's drive to sell arms in the Third World, including countries
opposed to U.S. interests, could again become an issue in 1989.

   Marked by wars, deep economic problems
and social and political instability, Central America poses new
foreign policy questions for the Bush administration in 1989.
   The president will have to decide if he will continue the Reagan
administration's funding for the Contra rebels in their attempt to
oust the almost 10-year-old leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua. Bush, shortly after his election, indicated he might take
a more diplomatic approach with the Sandinistas.
   The majority of the Contras, backed by the United States since
1981, moved into base camps in Honduras in 1988 to receive
U.S.-supplied goods ranging from food to uniforms. Honduras, a
strong U.S. ally, wants the United States to get the rebels out.
   In El Salvador, Marxist-led guerrillas appear more determined
than ever to topple the U.S.-backed government. More than $3 billion
in aid over almost a decade failed to end the war or right the
economy. Presidential elections in March favor the conservative
candidate from the National Republican Alliance, known as Arena.
   The Salvadoran conservatives promised a tougher approach toward
the guerrillas, battling since 1979.
   Honduras and Panama will hold presidential elections in 1989.
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman, could run and
win, putting the Bush administration in the position of dealing with
an elected leader who has been indicted on drug charges in the
United States.
   In Guatemala, a civil war with Marxist guerrillas simmers. The
democratically elected government will face continued pressures from
the ultra-conservative sector not to go soft on communism.

   South America's crushing foreign debt and
a firmly entrenched cocaine industry will pose tough challenges for
the new U.S. administration in 1989 and years go come.
   The foreign liabilities of South American nations surpass $250
billion and show no signs of shrinking. Several of the biggest
debtor countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Peru, spent 1988
struggling with stagnant economies, soaring inflation and spreading
social turmoil.
   Shackled by huge debt obligations, their governments are looking
north for reduced interest rates and other forms of financial
relief. It would be proof, they contend, that the United States and
other wealthy countries are sincere in their pledge to back the
continent's young and increasingly troubled democracies.
   Few South Americans expect any radical change in U.S. policy when
George Bush takes office, however. His secretary of state, former
Treasury chief James Baker, proposed three years ago a program of
new credits that debtor countries said did not go far enough.
   The billion-dollar cocaine business also is seen as endangering
the stability of some South American countries, including Colombia,
Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Despite the arrest of some kingpins and
seizures of tons of drugs, traffickers have remained largely immune
to law enforcement efforts by bribing, intimidating and even killing
public officials.
   During his campaign, Bush vowed an all-out war on narcotics
traffickers, saying he was willing to send U.S. troops into foreign
countries that wanted help battling drug production.

   Among Caribbean nations, Haiti poses
one of the most difficult problems the Bush administration is likely
to deal with.
   U.S. officials say they are encouraged by democratic reforms
undertaken by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril since he assumed Haiti's
presidency in a military coup Sept. 17.
   He has installed a mostly civilian Cabinet, purged the army of
scores of notoriously corrupt officers and stepped up cooperation
with the United States in reducing drug-trafficking through Haiti.
   At stake is $70 million in direct U.S. economic aid suspended by
Congress after abortive presidential elections in November 1987 in
which paramilitary thugs massacred at least 34 people at polling
stations.
   Bush must decide whether to recommend a resumption of aid in
hopes of keeping Avril in power long enough to make good on his
promise of democracy, or to await further reforms.
   Elsewhere in the Caribbean, the United States will be watching
for signs of a shift in Cuban-Soviet relations in view of Fidel
Castro's lack of enthusiasm for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for more
openness and economic enterprise.
   Bush can expect continued improvement in relations with Guyana,
as President Desmond Hoyte seeks Western aid in dealing with the
non-aligned nation's grave economic plight. A U.S. military aid team
is to begin work in Guyana this spring.
   In Jamaica, Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who is staunchly
pro-United States, faces a tough challenge from former Prime
Minister Michael Manley, a socialist, in elections expected early
this year.

   With economies booming from South Korea to
Singapore, the Far East will present George Bush with trade
frictions as well as uncertainties over domestic instability in key
allied countries and strains over U.S. military bases.
   Japan's juggernaut economy has accommodated to U.S. pressure to
increase domestic demand for imported goods, but as 1988 ended,
exports also were on an upswing, threatening more trouble for the
enduring U.S. trade deficit.
   The ``Little Dragons'' _ South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Singapore _ had economic growth rates of 6 to 11.5 percent in 1988,
with much of their production aimed at the lucrative U.S. market.
   Political strife in newly democratized countries like the
Philippines and South Korea will cause uneasiness, and both
countries have growing domestic opposition to strategically
important U.S. bases.
   Another problem with the Philippines for Bush is how to
coordinate with Japan and Western Europe on an aid package to help
reduce the country's $28-billion debt, and not break the U.S.
Treasury.
   In Indochina, Washington will have to figure out how the emerging
Chinese-Soviet rapprochement will affect the drive to get
Soviet-allied Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia without permitting
the China-backed Khmer Rouge guerrillas to return to rule.
   Washington supports the mercurial Prince Norodom Sihanouk as
leader of Cambodia after a Vietnamese withdrawal, and will face
renewed calls from Hanoi to normalize relations, since Vietnam is
increasing cooperation on refugees and on resolving cases of
Americans missing from the Vietnam War.

   George Bush will have to chart a new
American course for the superpower contest in the Asian Subcontinent
as the Kremlin shifts its focus in Afghanistan from an overt
military role to preservation of its political influence.
   The Soviet Union, which is scheduled to end its 9-year
intervention in Afghanistan by Feb. 15, recently bypassed President
Najib and opened its first publicly acknowledged talks with some of
the Afghan guerrillas fighting the Moscow-client regime.
   If Moscow neutralizes at least some guerrilla groups through
negotiations, the United States may have to decide whether to
recognize a post-Najib government or to continue supporting any
guerrillas who go on fighting.
   Bush will also be dealing with a new leader in Pakistan, Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has vowed to continue good relations
with Washington but seeks to improve ties with Moscow. Heavy
military aid to Pakistan still will be needed to counter Soviet
influence, political or military, in neighboring Afghanistan and
India and to satisfy the politically powerful Pakistani armed forces.
   India, the Subcontinent's biggest military and political force,
has improved ties with Washington while remaining friendly with
Moscow under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Gandhi must call new
elections by the end of 1989, but despite escalating attacks from
the political opposition, a viable alternative to the Gandhi dynasty
has yet to emerge.

   South Africa's white leaders
were relieved by George Bush's election, and they are apt to use
tactics in 1989 that would help him stifle any new sanctions
campaign by Democrats in Congress.
   These could include additional releases of political prisoners,
softening of some remaining apartheid laws and further diplomatic
overtures toward black Africa. The new year could see final
agreement on independence for South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia _ another development that would improve South Africa's
standing in Washington and elsewhere.
   In response to such gestures, anti-apartheid leaders in South
Africa _ and their allies abroad _ are likely to tell Bush that
continued pressure on the government is essential to force it to
lift harsh state-of-emergency regulations and grant full political
rights to the black majority.
   The probable settlement in Namibia is to be coupled to withdrawal
of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola, where they have been aiding
the Marxist government in a civil war against the UNITA rebel
movement. Bush will have to decide if and when to halt U.S. aid to
the rebels.
   Elsewhere in Africa, the new administration will have to wrestle
with a budgetary dilemma _ can it meet its deficit-cutting
priorities at home and still make an acceptable aid contribution to
a continent with staggering development needs?
   The Soviet bloc seems to have abandoned expansionist policies on
the continent, and left-leaning governments in countries such as
Mozambique, Angola and Ethiopia seem more willing than ever to turn
to the West for help.

<TEXT>
   U.S. concerns about Soviet intentions in
the South Pacific will be a major issue facing George Bush's
presidency.
   In a landmark speech in Vladivostok in July 1985, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev committed the South Union to exerting its influence across
the Pacific.
   A Soviet military threat seems remote but as one U.S. admiral
said, ``They have the capability.'' Soviet intentions, added a
senior diplomat, are the issue.
   Moscow, after winning a string of fishing agreements with small
island nations and then losing them, is now courting Australia.
   The collapse of ANZUS _ the Australia-New Zealand-U.S. military
treaty _ is no longer an issue. But what is, is the ``whole range of
alliances'' in a part of the world where a nuclear-capable U.S. Navy
is not as welcome as it once was.
   Other issues likely to cross Bush's desk are those of immediate
concern to the Pacific, such as France's refusal to abandon nuclear
testing in the area, its policies in New Caledonia, the future of
Antarctica and the prospect of mining for minerals there. Also,
there is the impact of the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' which scientists
predict will swamp some small island nations resulting in a flood of
``economic refugees.''
   The South Pacific is no longer the lagoon of tranquility it used
to be, as two military coups in Fiji attest. There are issues of
direct consequence to Australia, and therefore the United States.
The Pacific island nations have many of the problems of the Third
World, and for that reason Soviet initiatives are being watched.

   Canada will be looking for reassurance from
President Bush that it is trusted as an ally and valued as the
United States' No. 1 trading partner.
   A bruising campaign that gave Prime Minister Brian Mulroney his
second consecutive majority government put the spotlight on Canadian
concerns that the country is taken for granted, ignored or
overshadowed in the United States.
   The victory for Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party cleared
the way for the free trade agreement with the United States to
proceed, but it is a long-term pact that will be phased in over 10
years.
   Canadians will be looking for some signs that their willingness
to cooperate with Washington can produce some tangible results in an
easing of the trade squabbles still likely to occur in aspects
uncovered by the agreement.
   And, with economic growth expected to slow down in both
countries, great attention will be paid here to any plant closings
attributed to the new trade pact.
   In other issues, Canada will be looking to Bush to take promised
steps to cut down sulphur dioxide emissions blamed in large part for
producing the acid rain that devastates Canadian aquatic life in
sensitive lakes and streams.
   The private Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain found Bush's stand on
acid rain an improvement over the Reagan administration's record but
``weaker and vaguer'' than Michael Dukakis'.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and the United States face as many
problems as ever, but under the presidencies of George Bush in
Washington and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Mexico City their
historically prickly relationship will probably improve.
   Prime among problems in the coming months will be Mexico's
foreign debt, now $102 billion. Salinas says the $13 billion annual
payments should be reduced because they aren't leaving enough money
for economic growth.
   Salinas, inaugurated Dec. 1, is expected to tell bankers in 1989
that stifling growth is counterproductive in the long run.
   Renewing growth is vital for Salinas, because the average
Mexican's standard of living has suffered badly during years of
austerity. Salinas won a disputed election and better conditions
would strengthen his mandate.
   Bush has given Salinas a sympathetic ear, and the two appeared to
hit it off when they met in November. A recent $3.5 billion U.S.
loan offer was seen as a vote of confidence. Salinas is a hard-nosed
negotiator, but he is unlikely to let pride get in the way of
practical solutions.
   Other issues:
   _Trade: Mexico fears protectionist sentiment will cut access to
U.S. markets, restricting growth opportunities. A U.S. recession
would also hurt Mexico if exports went down.
   _Migration: Mexico resents the way migrants looking for jobs in
the United States are treated, since they fill an apparent need.
Salinas argues that growth is a key here too, because more jobs in
Mexico would reduce migration.
   _Drugs: Salinas has promised a harder fight against drug
trafficking, but expects the United States to crack down on demand.
   _Central America: Mexicans are hopeful the new administration
will focus less on an anti-communist crusade in Central America,
which was very unpopular here.

   After 2{ months of just saying ``no,''
Pillsbury Co. finally had no choice but to agree to a sweetened
$5.68 billion takeover bid from Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC,
securities analysts said.
   Pillsbury, a giant food and restaurant company, agreed to the

legal setbacks.
   Grand Met will purchase all outstanding shares of Pillsbury
common stock for $66 a share in cash, $3 higher than Grand Met's

   Pillsbury fits in well with Grand Met's strategy of focusing on
foods, liquor and retailing and expanding those businesses

   Oil futures prices began the week on a mixed
note, with wholesale unleaded gasoline gaining more ground but the

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
unleaded gasoline settled at 45.42 cents a gallon Monday, up 0.29
cent from the close Friday, when it rose 1.48 cents. Other contract
months declined.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Monday, January wholesale home heating oil fell 1.27 cents to 50.75
cents a gallon, after jumping 1.08 cents Friday.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $16.31 a barrel, down 41 cents
from Friday. It rose 37 cents in the previous session.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior energy analyst with E.D.&F. Man

largely to technical factors.
   ``I think WTI and heating oil were a bit overbought ... and
besides we're due for some warmer weather'' in the Northeast,
thereby lessening the demand for heating oil, he said.

special glasses, which will enable fans to see the 3-D approach,
with purchases of Diet Coke in the two weeks before the Jan. 22
contest for the NFL championship.
   Coca-Cola ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing
with the ``Moonlighting'' producers that a commercial and a portion
of the final show of the 1987-88 season would be shot with the new
3-D technology.
   But the episode was canceled after the writers went on strike and
the Coca-Cola commercial never was made. Production of the glasses
was halted at 20 million and they were stored while Coca-Cola looked
for other TV showcases.
   Network executives said the halftime program would be the first
live 3-D broadcast on network television, and would continue NBC's
tradition of innovation in football coverage. NBC broadcast a
``silent minute'' to give viewers a break from the Super Bowl
pre-game show in 1986 and aired an entire regular season game with
no announcers a few years ago.
   Viewers will need the glasses to get the 3-D effect, but a new
technology called Nuoptix 3-D, developed by Terry Beard, founder and
head of the Los-Angeles-based Nuoptix Associates Inc., leaves the
picture normal for others.
   The patented process avoids the distortion or double-imaging of
the picture that the 3-D processes of the 1950s caused for those
without special glasses.
   Not content to let a volley sound in the cola wars without
responding, Pepsi-Cola Co. announced separately Monday that its Diet
Pepsi brand has agreed to be the official sponsor of NBC's NFL
player talent show to be broadcast before the big game. The talent
show will match NFL players in competition as singers, dancers and
comedians.
   Calling the announcement ``a surprise move,'' Pepsi's executive
vice president of marketing and sales, Michael Lorelli, said ``Diet
Pepsi's end-run on Diet Coke just signaled the start of an intense
off-the-field battle.''
   Asked about Pepsi's announcement at the news conference where he
announced the deal with Coca-Cola, NBC Sports executive producer
Michael Weisman said the network had not settled sponsorship of the
pre-game talent show.
   But a Pepsi spokesman, Tod MacKenize, insisted that Pepsi-Cola
had returned a signed contract to NBC last week and that the deal
was done.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers,
N.Y., dominate the $43.2 billion U.S. soft drink business.
   Diet Coke is the best-selling diet soft drink and the third
biggest seller overall with about 8.2 percent of the overall soft
drink market. Diet Pepsi ranks second in the category and fourth
overall at 5.2 percent.
   The two soft drink giants are always on the lookout for splashy
new ways to boost anticipation of their commercials and get big
audiences for them.
   Michael Beindorff, vice president for advertising at Coca-Cola,
said he had been aproached with dozens of opportunities to showcase
a 3-D commercial, but rejected them until the Super Bowl opportunity
came along.
   ``This is not just a few minutes or a couple of special
effects,'' Beindorff said. ``It's not just pre-game fluff or a
post-game throwaway.''

<TEXT>
   Settlement talks between the government and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. over as yet unfiled securities fraud
charges have reached a difficult stage, the investment firm's chief
executive has told employees.
   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph also said Monday the
investment firm couldn't accept the terms presented to it, sources
familiar with the remarks said. The sources, who spoke on condition
they not be identified, said the tone of the statement suggested an
indictment had become more likely.
   Joseph made his remarks over a public-address system, and they
were broadcast to Drexel branches nationwide.
   The sources paraphrased Joseph as saying, ``Not at this point
does a settlement make sense.''
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been the subject
of an intense investigation for more than two years stemming from
its involvement with Ivan F. Boesky, the one-time speculator now
serving a 3-year prison term for the biggest insider trading fraud
in U.S. history.
   Drexel repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing but has been
negotiating with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office over the past
two months in an effort to avoid an indictment for racketeering and
securities fraud.
   The government reportedly has demanded that Drexel plead guilty
to multiple felony counts and pay a fine as high as $750 million. In
addition, the government has requested Drexel's assistance in
implicating other possible wrongdoers, both within and outside the
firm.
   Steven Anreder, Drexel's chief spokesman, declined comment on
Joseph's reported remarks to employees. Deborah Corley, spokeswoman
for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, also declined
comment.
   There has been heightened speculation in the past few weeks that
Drexel would reach a plea-bargain settlement with the government
before Christmas. Federal prosecutors have intensified the pressure
by exacting cooperation from at least three traders in Drexel's West
Coast high-yield bond department.
   Drexel's problems began after Boesky paid a $100 million fine to
the Securities and Exchange Commission in November 1986 and agreed
to plead guilty to a felony charge as part of his plea-bargain.
Three months ago, the SEC filed a wide-ranging civil lawsuit against
Drexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and three other
key employees, accusing them of conspiring with Boesky to violate a
range of securities laws.
   Drexel was a pioneer in the $175 billion high-yield bond market.
It is one of the most profitable Wall Street firms and has around
10,000 employees worldwide.

<TEXT>
   _Oct. 4, 1988: Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British distilling,
gambling and food giant, makes a surprise $60-a-share, $5.23 billion
offer for Pillsbury Co., the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant
chain subjected to repeated takeover rumors in preceding months
because of its depressed stock price. The offer is 53 percent more
than Pillsbury's closing stock price of Oct. 3.
   _Oct. 6: Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith tells the company's
100,000 employees the Grand Met offer is illegal and he refuses to
meet with the suitor. Besides asserting its ``poison pill''
shareholder-rights anti-takeover bylaw, Pillsbury plans a complex
defense that reportedly includes an effort to overturn Grand Met's
U.S. liquor-distribution licenses. It also creates an ad depicting
the famed Pillsbury ``doughboy'' strutting boxing gloves.
   _Oct. 17: Pillsbury board formally declares the Grand Met order
inadequate and orders advisers to explore alternatives.
   _Nov. 7: Faced with increased pressure to capitulate by dissident
shareholders, Pillsbury proposes spinoff of Burger King fast-food
subsidiary as part of defensive restructuring to thwart Grand Met,
but the proposal is widely criticized as a feeble effort to remain
independent. Meanwhile, Grand Met says nearly 75 percent of
Pillsbury's shares have been tendered, but acquisition of the
company is delayed by legal haggling over Pillsbury's poison pill
defense.
   _Nov. 13: Reports surface that Pillsbury may attempt a so-called
``Pac-Man'' defense by acquiring Grand Met, which is twice
Pillsbury's size. Grand Met's management expresses concern about it,
but Pillsbury declines comment.
   _Nov. 20: Pillsbury board delays spinoff of Burger King in
response to opposition from the chain's 1,400 franchises.
   _Nov. 30: Pillsbury suggests it would be willing to meet with
Grand Met if a higher offer emerged.
   _Dec. 9-11: Weekend bargaining results in a sweetened Grand Met
offer of $63, but Pillsbury balks at an agreement.
   _Dec. 16: A Delaware judge invalidates Pillsbury's poison pill
defense and further postpones Burger King spinoff. A separate ruling
by a Minnesota judge also blocks the Burger King spinoff. Hours
later, both sides agree to a $66-a-share takeover worth $5.68
billion.
   _Dec. 18: Pillsbury board formally announces approval of the
takeover.

<HEAD>Federal Court Throws Out State Stock Arbitration Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has thrown out controversial
first-in-the-nation state regulations, inspired by the 1987 stock
market crash, that allowed stock traders to sue brokers more easily
in financial disputes.
   In a 36-page ruling issued Monday, U.S. District Court Judge
Douglas P. Woodlock threw out regulations promulgated in September
by Massachusetts Secretary of State Michael Connolly.
   The regulations, set to take effect Jan., prevented stockbrokers
from requiring customers to agree to arbitration in stock disputes
instead of lawsuits. A top aide to Connolly said the state likely
would appeal the ruling.
   A coalition of brokers sued the state in September and Woodlock
heard the case two weeks ago. In his ruling he said the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1987 upheld the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses to
govern resolution of controversies between brokers and their
customers.
   Typically, the agreements state that in the event of a dispute,
the customer and the broker would go into arbitration before a
mutually acceptable party _ the New York Stock Exchange, for example
_ rather than take the case to court.
   Woodlock ruled in favor of the brokers who argued that
arbitration is a quicker, cheaper way of settling disputes and that
Massachusetts had improperly usurped federal authority in regulating
securities trading.
   ``On the evidence before me, it appears that court litigation
affords customers the opportunity to pay more in legal costs to get
less in recovery,'' Woodlock wrote. ``To the degree that arbitration
constitutes a more economical form of dispute resolution, it may be
anticipated that regulations which discourage arbitration will have
the effect of raising commission rates.''
   The regulations, Woodlock said, ``single out arbitration
agreements for more demanding standards than are imposed by the
general law of contract in Massachusetts.'' Woodlock said the state
regulations would increase the federal caseload at a time when the
court system is already overburdened.
   ``My clients are delighted that the court agreed with our
position that these regulations were invalid,'' said attorney Gerald
Rath of the Boston law firm Bingham, Dana & Gould. Rath represents
the Securities Industry Association and 10 brokerage firms,
including Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Fidelity Brokerage Services
Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Deputy Secretary of State Marty Meehan said officials in
Connolly's securities division still were reviewing the ruling
Monday evening but he said, ``in all likelihood we will request the
attorney general to appeal the decision.''
   Meehan said the regulations stemmed from a flood of complaints
following the stockmarket crash of October 1987 when thousands of
customers alleged that their urgent stock transactions were
misplaced or mishandled. In the disputes that followed, Meehan said,
stock customers found to their surprise that they had signed away
their right to sue.
   The state regulations would have required brokers to fully
disclose the terms of their arbitration agreements and give
customers the option of maintaining their right to sue in court.
   ``Our beef isn't necessarily with the arbitration process,''
Meehan said. ``Our concern is with investors signing away their
rights unknowingly.''
   Woodlock said full disclosure is desirable but is not adequately
defined in the state regulations.

<HEAD>`Always Open' Restaurant Chain Closing For Christmas Day For First
Time</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: In Tuesday AMs report; brief version for Monday PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LA MIRADA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The signs say ``Always Open,'' but for
the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 Denny's restaurants
across the United States will close their doors for Christmas Day.
   Locking those doors is a different story.
   Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the
always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and
the keys can't be found. The company is having to install locks at
about 700 restaurants, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing at
the company's southern California headquarters.
   The company decided to close this year so employees could have
the day off.
   ``It will cost us about $5 million in sales,'' Herrera said.
   The chain's 60,000 employees were so grateful for the holiday
that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices,
Herrera said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day.
   ``We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other
people's families; for one day a year we want to take care of our
own,'' he said.
   Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the
top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five
employees.
   In Hollywood, the companywide closing solved manager Almaz
Legesse's problem of choosing which employees of a Sunset Boulevard
restaurant to give the day off. ``I had a big list. ... I was having
a hard time,'' she said.
   The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers,
was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. ``We never had locks,'' Ms.
Legesse said.
   ``After so many years of working Christmas every year it's real
nice,'' said Lee Sevene, a manager at a Denny's near a turnpike in
Portland, Me.
   ``People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,'' said
Frances Bushman, manager of a Pismo Beach, Calif., Denny's.
   ``On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and
cooks,'' she said.
   Ms. Bushman's Denny's has locks but she had to check to see if
the keys fit.
   Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average
days at Denny's, Herrera said.
   ``We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that's
all day _ not just at midday,'' Herrera said. ``It actually starts
on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.''
   The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators
of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own
decisions.
   Winifred Gibson, a manager at two Denny's franchise restaurants
in Fresno, Calif., said they would remain open for the biggest day
of the year.
   But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a Denny's.
   ``Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major
fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,'' Ms. Gibson said.
   Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with
no children or elderly people with no family, she said. ``But not
anymore. You have so many one-parent families.''
   The three franchise Denny's in Anchorage, Alaska, and one in
Fairbanks will be open, said Donna Flanagan, manager of an Anchorage
restaurant.
   Ms. Flanagan expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas,
which is second only to Mother's Day in bringing in customers.

   A. Duda & Sons began as a 10-acre farm near here, and mushroomed
into a farming giant from Florida to California and Australia.
Today, the company handles vegetables, citrus, sugar cane, sod,
foliage, cattle and real estate.
   John Duda, who died Saturday, joined the family business in 1926.
He worked behind the scenes to design special farming, irrigation
and packing equipment that is now widely used in farming on organic
soils.
   He retired as corporate vice president in 1976 and served on the
Duda board of directors until January of this year. Last year Forbes

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Continental Corp. has agreed to sell its
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association subsidiary to a California
investment group.
   Under the deal announced late Monday, the company will recieve
$288.7 million in newly issued preferred stock of Lincoln Savings in
exchange its common stock interest in Lincoln.
   The sale to a group headed by Glendale, Calif., investor Spencer
Scott follows an investigation by the California Department of
Savings and Loans into American Continental's use of Irvine,
Calif.-based Lincoln.
   The agency had ordered American Continental to stop selling
subordinated debentures _ uninsured, long-term debt backed by
corporate earnings _ through Lincoln.
   American Continental spokeswoman Patricia Johonson said the
timing of the sale had nothing to do with the recent decision in
California.
   ``It was just good business sense to make the deal now,'' she
said. ``Frankly, we had received offers from Mr. Scott a couple of
months ago.''
   As part of the deal, American Continental, a financial-services
and real-estate development company, also will gain Lincoln Savings'
interests in a newly opened Phoenician resort and in the Crescent
Hotel in Phoenix, Ms. Johnson said.
   The acquisition is subject to approval by California and federal
regulatory agencies and is expected to be completed in about two
months, Ms. Johnson said.

   Starting Jan. 1, China will ban exports of copper,
aluminum and four other metal products due to short supplies on the

   The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade also banned
sales of nickel, nickel products, platinum and yellow phosphorus, it
said. Alloys of copper, aluminum and nickel also will go on the
banned list.
   A ministry official said that in 1987 China exported nickel
products worth $47.5 million, aluminum worth $31.2 million, copper
worth $23.3 million and yellow phosphorus worth $9.8 million. There
were no figures for platinum exports.
   Xinhua said government bans on the exports of musk, natural
bezoar, raw polythene materials and monazite remain in effect.
   The new measures also call for limits on the export of 12
commodities, including, metallic magnesium and rubber. Exporters of
these materials must apply for licenses from the Ministry of
Materials and Equipment.
   China is trying to cope with serious raw materials shortages that
have led to sharply higher prices, hoarding and profiteering.

<HEAD>Sotheby's Reports 27.5 Percent Increase in Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's, the international auction house,
reported a 27.5 percent increase in auction sales during 1988,
highlighted by the sale of collections belonging to Elton John and
Andy Warhol and paintings by Pablo Picasso and Jasper Johns.
   Worldwide sales totaled $1.814 billion in 1988, compared with
$1.423 billion last year and more than triple the 1984 figure of
$586 million, said a statement released Monday by the 244-year-old
auction house.
   The statement quoted Michael Ainslie, president and chief
executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., as saying that while
``extraordinary prices'' were being reached at the top end of the
market, the middle and low ranges also were doing well, with about
190,000 lots valued at under 10,000 dollars sold in 1988.
   The statement did not mention Sotheby's annual profit.
   Sotheby's noted the art collection belonging to Warhol, the late
American pop artist, sold for around $25.3 million, and British
singer Elton John's sold for $8.7 million.
   ``False Start'' by Johns, the American artist, fetched $17.05
million, a record for a work by a living artist and for any
contemporary work sold at auction, the Sotheby's statement said.
Picasso's ``La Cage d'Oiseaux'' went for $15.4 million, it said.
   Other notable sales were the original manuscript of Franz Kafka's
novel ``The Trial,'' which brought nearly $2 million, four times the
previous record for a modern literary manuscript, it said.
   A console table made for Marie Antoinette sold for nearly $3
million, and a Cycladic marble head of a goddess fetched $2.09
million, a record for a classical antiquity.
   The typescript of Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of ``The War
of the Worlds'' was sold for $143,000 and the piano that featured in
the Paris scene from the movie ``Casablanca'' went for $154,000, it
said.
   Sotheby's also said that in 1988 it staged the first
international auction in the United States and was the first Western
auction house to hold a sale in China.

<HEAD>Economy Expands At 2.5 Percent Annual Rate In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines all pvs takes. A version moving on general news
wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy, held back by the summer drought,
expanded at a moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent last summer, the
slowest pace in nearly two years, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, slowed in the third quarter
after growing at a robust 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter and
3.0 percent in the second.
   That would be good news for analysts worried that the economy is
overheating and becoming inflationary, except that the underlying
strength is being masked by the temporary effects of the drought,
which seared pastures and shriveled crops. That knocked $12.3
billion off the GNP, which was at an inflation and seasonally
adjusted annual level of $4.01 trillion in the July-September period.
   Excluding the drought, the GNP grew 3.9 percent in the second
quarter and 3.0 percent in the third.
   The GNP figure for the third quarter was a slight downward
revision from a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent issued a month
ago. Most economists had been looking for a slight upward
adjustment. It was the slowest pace of expansion since the fourth
quarter of 1986.
   Most of the downward revision was accounted for by a
larger-than-previously-thought decline in government spending.
   The department also increased its estimate of inflation. A price
index tied to GNP and adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in
buying patterns increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the
third quarter, up from 5.0 percent in the second and the fastest
pace in six years.
   In an accompanying report, the Commerce Department said corporate
profits after taxes advanced 3.9 percent in the third quarter after
soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. An earlier estimate had
said third quarter profits rose only a slight 0.2 percent.
   Although GNP growth, at least for the third quarter, has slowed
to the 2.0 to 2.5 percent range that the Federal Reserve Board
considers sustainable without inflation, most analysts believe the
economy is rebounding in the current quarter. But again, the drought
is likely to artificially lower the GNP number.
   Fed members fear that a GNP growth rate higher than the target
range will strain factory capacity, leading to shortages and
resulting price increases. Also, by boosting employment, the growth
encourages employers to bid up the prices of attracting qualified
workers by raising wages. The ``cure'' is higher interest rates
designed to make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to
spend.
   ``The Fed's tightening since March has had only a marginal impact
on the economy. With growth so strong and jobs so strong it looks
like the economy has continued to march on,'' said Paul W. Boltz, an
economist with T. Rowe Price Associates, a financial services firm
in Baltimore.
   The Fed capped a series of tightening moves in mid-August by
boosting the discount rate, the rate it charges for loans to member
banks, by a half percentage point to 6.5 percent.
   When the numbers came in for August and September, it seemed as
if the dose of tighter money was working. The unemployment rate,
after hitting a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June, jumped to 5.6
percent in August, the Fed's closely watched measure of factory
operating rates was holding steady, and retail sales posted a rare
decline in September.
   But, a series of government reports over the last seven weeks
shows that the economy came roaring back in October and November.
Unemployment dipped down again to the levels of late spring, retail
sales surged and the factory operating rate climbed to the highest
level in nine years.
   The Fed responded last week by bumping up the federal funds rate,
the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter
of a percentage point to 8~ percent.
   Michael K. Evans, an economic consultant in Washington, said it
is a question of when, not if, the Fed will tighten further.
   ``Every (economic statistic) that has appeared this month has
been as strong or stronger than the consensus. I don't know what the
Fed is waiting for. If this had been (former Fed Chairman Paul)
Volcker, the discount would have been raised. ... (Fed Chairman
Alan) Greenspan is more cautious, but there comes a time when it is
better to get it over with,'' he said.
   Evans is expecting a discount rate hike early in 1989. Boltz,
however, says the Fed may be satisfied with further increases in the
federal funds rate and may be saving a discount rate hike, the most
dramatic move it can take, for a crisis like a precipitous fall in
the value of the dollar.
   Both look for strong GNP growth _ higher than a 4 percent annual
rate _ until higher interest rates take their toll, sometime in
mid-1989.

<TEXT>
   Indonesia opened the door Tuesday to
new stock markets, leasing companies and insurance firms to help
mobilize public funds and create new financing sources to support
production.
   The new policy, contained in presidential and ministerial
decrees, allows the private sector to open new securities exchanges
that would operate side-by-side with the stock market organized by
the government. Organizers of the new exchanges must be Indonesians.
   Exchanges may be opened in cities other than Jakarta, and company
shares may be listed on both private exchanges and the existing
Jakarta Stock Exchange.
   The regulations also banned insider trading based on confidential
information about the companies issuing stock.
   The government also opened the way to formation of leasing
companies, either by Indonesians or by joint ventures owned at least
15 percent by Indonesians.
   It simplified procedures for establishing insurance companies,
and specified that joint ventures in this field must be at least 20
percent Indonesian-owned.
   The new regulations permit banks and other financial insitutions
to trade securities and engage in credit-card and consumer finance
businesses.

   Stock prices advanced broadly this morning,
extending the gains of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose nearly 22
points on Monday, was up another 8.75 to 2,181.43 after 30 minutes
of trading.
   That was near its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 set Oct. 21.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of more than 2 to 1
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 681 issues
up, 286 down and 570 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 30.32 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 19.41 million shares at the same
point on Monday.
   The market appeared to take some encouragement this morning from
a pair of economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and
moderate economic growth.
   The government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent
in November, a slightly slower pace than some analysts expected.
   In another report the government lowered its estimate of economic
growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent from 2.6
percent.
   But while some analysts say the conditions are right for a
year-end stock rally, others said the recent gains may be
short-lived.
   The skeptics note that short-term interest rates near 9 percent
are are making Treasury issues attractive compared with the
uncertain yields on stocks.
   In the credit markets today, however, rates on one-year Treasury
bills were slightly lower.
   International Business Machines was among the active issues in
the early going on the NYSE, rising 1\ to 124.
   Among other widely-held issues, General Electric was up { at 46{,
Exxon was up \ at 46] and American Telephone & Telegraph was
unchanged at 30.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.54 to 156.92. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market
index was up 0.49 at 299.19.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.97 to 2,172.68.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 839 up, 598 down and 523 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 162.25 million shares, against 196.48
million in the previous session.

   Inflation slowed last month to an annual rate
of just 3 percent, the government said today, as clothing prices
fell for the first time since August and food prices stabilized for
the first time since last February.
   The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, after
seasonal adjustments, rose just 0.3 percent in November, compared
with a 0.4 percent gain a month earlier. Before the seasonal
adjustments, prices rose just 0.1 percent, the department said.
   The monthly inflation figure, rounded off in the announcement to
0.3, was actually 0.25, adding up to 3 percent annually.
   The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 per
cent for the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the
first 11 months.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented, ``Consumer
price inflation appears to be moderating.'' He noted that inflation
has been lower in the second half of the year than the first half.
   With only December left, another month similar to November could
enable the Reagan Administration to finish its last year in office
meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988.
   The Commerce Department said today that the gross national
product, the broadest measure of economic health, expanded at a
moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent in the third quarter, held back
by the summer drought. For the same period, the department reported
that after-tax corporate profits rose 3.9 percent, down from a
robust 8.9 percent increase the previous quarter.
   Food prices, which had risen at an annual rate of 10.9 percent
from April through September because of the summer drought, were
unchanged in November after rising only 0.2 percent in October, the
Labor Department reported.
   Clothing prices that had jumped a total of 4 percent in September
and October with the introduction of new back-to-school and fall
fashions fell 0.3 percent last month.
   `Widespread promotional sales for footwear and women's and girl's
clothing were largely responsible for the November decrease,'' the
Labor Department said.
   Housing and shelter costs, including residential rents, rose
another 0.3 percent, the same pace they have maintained over the
past nine months.
   Natural gas and electric rates were up 1.8 percent and 0.1
percent, respectively, from October, more than offsetting a 2
percent drop in prices for more heavily purchased home heating oil,
the government said.
   The November decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil. Its
price is now 10.8 percent below what it was last spring.
   Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from October
but remain 0.2 percent less than they were at the end of last year
and 28.1 percent below their peak level of March 1981.
   Excluding food, energy and shelter, consumer prices for other
items rose an average 0.2 percent in November compared with a jump
of 0.7 percent the previous month.
   The November increase raised the CPI to 120.3 from 120.2 in
October, meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing $100 in a
1982-84 base period would have cost $120.30 last month. In November
1987, that same marketbasket would have cost $115.40.
   New car prices declined by 0.2 percent, reflecting the
introduction of rebates on some of the new 1989 models after rising
by more than a full percentage point in September and October.
   However, auto financing and insurance costs continued to advance
dramatically, with the former up 1.5 percent and the latter 0.9
percent above October. Airline fares also jumped a dramatic 1.1
percent.
   Medical costs, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent last month and are up
at an annual rate of 7 percent so far this year. Other goods and
services also rose 0.4 percent and are 7.1 percent higher than they
were a year ago, the government said.
   Food buyers last month found seasonally adjusted meat, poultry,
fish, egg and fresh fruit and vegetable prices lower than they were
in October. However, prices were higher for canned and dried fruits
and vegetables, restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages.

   The stock market extended its recent advance this

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For months, nearly two dozen
$30,000-a-year jobs in Brownsville with the world's largest
windshield-wiper maker have gone begging. Trico Technologies Corp.
has failed to find the skilled labor needed for the positions.
   The company, with twin plants on both sides of the Mexican
border, also has to import millions of dollars in supplies from
other states, though it would prefer to do more business in this
area beset by poverty and unemployment.
   Companies manufacturing in Mexico's maquiladora program would
like to leave hundreds of millions of dollars in this and other U.S.
cities along the border, if only they had some place to spend it.
   Researchers say a fortune is bypassing these communities while
they struggle to catch up with and understand the industrial
revolution taking place in their backyards.
   Since the mid-1960s, Mexico's maquiladora program allowing
foreign operation of manufacturing facilities has brought 1,200
mostly U.S.-operated plants to its northern frontier.
   The companies use inexpensive Mexican labor and then export the
components back to the United States, paying tax only on the value
added by the labor of the maquiladora workers, who numbered 330,000
in 1987.
   U.S. companies, including automobile and electronics
manufacturers, have moved operations to the border from the
industrialized Midwest and Northeast. But most of the parts and
supplies come from outside of the border area.
   A study of the 104 maquiladora plants on Mexico's side of the
border between Brownsville and Laredo found they annually spend $1.3
billion to $1.6 billion for parts and supplies. More than 90 percent
is spent outside Texas, said Dr. J. Michael Patrick, director of Pan
American University's Center for Entrepreneurship and Economic
Development, which conducted the study.
   The center, however, learned from companies operating on the
border that those firms would like to buy 25 percent to 30 percent
of their component parts and materials locally. That would bring
hundreds of millions of dollars to the region _ if only those
materials were available on the border.
   ``The advantages of having a supplier here along the border are
significant, in terms of cost reductions, in terms of just
communicating and being able to get quick turn around on style
changes, on modifications and specifications and so forth,'' Patrick
said. ``Now it makes a lot of sense to have your supplier as nearby
as possible.''
   But the metal and molded-plastic parts they need just are not
available in most border areas, so they buy from more established
locales. Most of the final product assembly also takes place
elsewhere.
   Trico is one of the few companies operating a true ``twin
plant,'' the ideal maquiladora with a significant work force on both
sides of the U.S.-Mexican boundary. The 450 employees in Brownsville
finish the windshield wiper products begun by the 1,400 workers in
its Matamoros plant.
   The Buffalo, N.Y.-based company produces more than 70 percent of
the original automobile windshield wiper equipment worldwide, as
well as a majority of wiper blades found in auto supply stores.
Eighty percent of Trico's production has moved to
Brownsville-Matamoros in the past two years, but it still buys most
supplies and parts in highly industrialized areas up north.
   ``The game plan is to get those manufacturing operations set up
down here to eliminate the need to transport parts down here,'' said
Kenneth Wertz, manager of Trico's Brownsville operation.
   But the area has no history of the type of technically complex
manufacturing processes needed to produce those parts, and no
experienced work force.
   ``There are certain skills like tool makers that we can't get
down here,'' Wertz said.
   A nationwide shortage of tool-and-die workers to produce
precision machine parts is even worse in an area where there has
been little need for that type of skill, he said. So the company,
with 22 openings for the high-paying tool-and-die positions, has
started in-house training, but it takes several years to turn out an
experienced tool maker.
   Meanwhile, Trico contracts the work out, usually to tool-and-die
operations far away.
   ``We don't have any choice,'' Wertz said.
   ``None of the locals really relate to that type of
manufacturing,'' said Jerry Simpton, vice president of Del Rio
National Bank and head of the industrial development committee for
the city's chamber of commerce.
   ``The locals may think about putting up a building to lease to
the industries, but not putting up a building to actually do the
manufacturing,'' Simpton said.
   Bernardo Sauceda, who has one of the few tool-and-die operations
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, said his Sauceda's Precision
Grinding Inc. in San Benito constantly stays busy. On one recent
afternoon, his shop was producing quality control gauges for the
1990-91 models of an automobile manufacturer he chose not to
identify, with skills he brought back from his years in Chicago.
They are skills he realizes his native region lacks.
   ``This is not an industrial area,'' Sauceda said. ``It's
agricultural. The area's just starting to be industrial.''
   John Heath, who operates Ten-Tex Tool and Supply Co. in Laredo,
said he could double his business if he had the skilled tool-and-die
workers.
   Companies supplying the maquiladoras also hesitate to relocate to
the border without the security of having several customers in the
area, Patrick said. That presents opportunities for new local
companies, he said, but skilled-labor shortages and banks
inexperienced in financing industrial plants hinder new growth.
   There are some local supply operations gradually developing. Bob
DeSpain has seen the growth since three years ago, when he founded
Unit Source Inc., producing molded plastic parts in the Valley city
of La Feria.
   ``There weren't any suppliers in the area, and now there are
30,'' said DeSpain, who has formed a maquiladora consulting firm,
Intelecsis Inc., since leaving Unit Source after a takeover.
   Cities, however, should not overlook the importance of
warehousing and transportation jobs the maquiladoras create on the
American side of the border, said Gary Jacobs, president of Laredo
National Bank.
   ``I would personally rather have the largest maquila and
manufacturing operations in Mexico, using Laredo, Texas, as their
warehousing and distribution centers, their packaging centers and
their sales centers, than I would to have the same division give us
a labor-intensive, minimum-wage kind of factory that they're better
able to do somewhere else,'' Jacobs said.

   When Louise Hackett was a teen bride
whose young Marine husband was off fighting the Korean War, she
thought it a stroke of luck that she landed a job fresh out of high
school as a legal secretary.
   She had no way of knowing the on-the-job training in her northern
California hometown of Yreka would support her and her young son
after she divorced five years later. Moreover, it would give birth
to a multimillion-dollar business that's about to go nationwide.
   After more than 30 years of providing office help to attorneys,
as factotum, job trainer and job counselor, Hackett wants to become
to paralegal employment services what Ray Kroc was to McDonald's
restaurants.
   Hackett's corporation, Legalstaff, may be the first in the nation
to franchise employee placement agencies that cater exclusively to
the legal profession.
   Legalstaff is the outgrowth of Legal Personnel Services,
Hackett's 15-year-old placement service with offices in Sacramento,
Mountain View and San Francisco that grossed $1.4 million in the
first 10 months of this year. The business provides law firms with
permanent and temporary legal secretaries, paralegals and attorneys.
   Hackett said franchising will allow her to tap an unmined market
without the problem of finding the right managers and job counselors
for new branch offices. She'll also earn about $25,000 for every
franchise sold. Her maps would cross-section cities by every 1,500
law firms, making Los Angeles and Washington worth more than
$100,000 each in licensing fees.
   ``I want to eventually run around and play Colonel Sanders...have
my pictures taken with the (franchise) owners on their 10th
anniversary, or whatever,'' she said in an interview in her downtown
Sacramento office.
   Hackett, 55, was a founder of the former Pacific College of Legal
Careers, a two-year Sacramento business school which she sold in
1984 to Barclay Colleges.
   Although Legalstaff Corp. is barely a year old, Hackett said she
expects to sell 100 franchises within three years, a growth estimate
she called ``very controlled.'' Already, she said she's received 50
responses to ads in the Wall Street Journal, and expects
negotiations for the Los Angeles franchises to conclude by the end
of the year.
   Hitching onto national trends toward a litigious society and
service economy, Hackett said her specialized matchmaking service
also meets the unique needs of the tradition-steeped legal
profession.
   The nation's lawyer population is expected to burgeon to 1
million by 1990, aggravating a chronic shortage of qualified legal
secretaries and paralegals.
   Hackett said her service saves attorneys expensive time in
finding loyal office help who are crucial to a trade that produce
volumes of paper in often arcane language under court deadlines.
   For workers looking to change law firms, she said, the service
offers discretion. ``It's very difficult to change jobs (as a legal
secretary) because there are no secrets, you see,'' she said. ``You
put the word out that you're looking for a job and the boss gets
unhappy.
   ``You have to be discreet about it because attorneys are very
territorial.''
   Because her business competes with other placement agencies for
job applicants, Hackett said the service is free to job seekers. She
charges law firms the equivalent of one month's salary for every
worker placed.
   Hackett ventured into the personnel business in 1973 after
working for law firms in Yreka, Eugene, Ore. and Sacramento and the
Capitol office of Gordon Cologne, a state assemblyman and senator
who later became a federal judge.
   She said the idea of a legal placement service dawned on her six
years earlier when she helped a lobbyist open a law office and
couldn't find a temporary secretary to fill in while she studied for
midterm examinations at California State University, Sacramento. She
eventually earned her bachelor's in English and masters in business
administration at Sacramento State.
   When she opened her doors, she was immediately swamped with calls
from 52 law offices but received only five applications from job
seekers. That prompted her soon after to open her school to train
legal secretaries and paralegals.
   Her second husband, Lewis Hackett, eventually followed her into
the law field. The government analyst-turned-attorney has his office
next to hers.
   Louise Hackett said franchising was a natural step for her
business. ``I wanted to grow. I didn't want to put a lid on it. It's
not exciting for your staff if your business isn't growing. I
haven't noticed anyone around here getting bored.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Profit-taking in the wake of Monday's surprisingly strong showing
pressured the market early, and traders said overnight rain in the
soybean growing regions of Brazil helped keep the lid tight.
   Even corn was unable to post gains, despite an announcement the
Soviets had bought 750,000 tons of corn, and are expected back for
another shipment of the same size, possibly later this afternoon.
   On the opening, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.35{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3 cents lower, with December at $2.69 a bushel; oats were 2{
cents to 4 cents lower, with December at $2.28\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 2{ cents to 6 cents lower, with January at $7.89 a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed to mostly lower at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with December at
73.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent
higher, with January at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent
lower to .20 cent higher, with December at 44.60 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .17 cent to .40 cent lower, with February
at 45.00 cents a pound.

Say</HEAD>

   Pillsbury Co. shareholders are the big winners
in Pillsbury's decision to accept a sweetened $5.68 billion takeover
bid from Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC, securities analysts say.
   ``The shareholders are the first people to profit, from what I
can tell,'' June Page, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Co. in New York,
said Monday. ``The employees of Pillsbury should profit tremendously
and ultimately the consumer.''
   ``They had no other direction to go. We knew that from day one,''
said Craig Carver, an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis.
``I don't know if I can answer the question why they prolonged the
pain for so long.''
   Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith on Monday defended
management's 2{-month battle against the buyout bid, which ended
Sunday when the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company
accepted Grand Met's latest $66 a share offer.
   ``I think the practical fact of the matter is that we got them to
move off a very firm position,'' Smith told KARE-TV of the Twin
Cities. ``So I don't apologize for our strategy one bit.''
   In a letter Monday to Pillsbury employees, Smith said the company
was pleased with the outcome because it represented a 10 percent
increase from Grand Met's original $60-a-share tender offer and
because the new ownership will allow Burger King franchises a chance
to grow.
   ``It's time to take off the gloves and get on with the next
chapter,'' said Smith. ``We're convinced that Pillsbury's
outstanding brand franchises and products will prosper with the
enthusiastic backing and support of Grand Metropolitan PLC.''
   Meanwhile today, Pillsbury reported its profit fell 38 percent in
the second quarter ended Nov. 30 and 10 percent for the first six
months of fiscal 1989 ``due to a substantial one-time investment in
the Burger King advertising fund and the cost of responding'' to
Grand Met's takeover offer.
   Second-quarter net income totaled $44.8 million, or 52 cents per
share, compared with $72.5 million, or 84 cents per share, in the
same period a year ago. Sales rose to $1.75 billion from $1.69
billion.
   For the six months, net earnings were $116.2 million, or $1.35
per share, vs. $129.3 million, or $1.50 per share, during the
comparable period of fiscal 1988. Sales were $3.23 billion, compared
with $3.14 billion, last year.
   Pillsbury's board of directors approved the takeover Sunday after
a Delaware judge on Friday invalidated its key takeover defenses: a
``poison pill'' plan and the proposed spinoff of its Miami-based
Burger King fast-food chain.
   Pillsbury common stock was trading at about $39 a share the day
before Grand Met launched its takeover bid Oct. 4.
   The stock closed up $3.12{ Monday at $65.37{ a share.
   In addition to benefiting Pillsbury shareholders, shares, the
Grand Met takeover should secure the jobs of most company employees.
But analysts said top Pillsbury executives probably should start
looking elsewhere for work, analysts said.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg said he could not comment on
whether top executives or employees would be laid off.
   Top management has been under fire in recent years because of
Pillsbury's lackluster financial performance. Smith, former chairman
of General Foods Corp., earlier this year succeeded William H.
Spoor, who came out of retirement to head Pillsbury on an interim
basis in February after former chairman John Stafford resigned under
pressure.
   Pillsbury's results were depressed again this year. After-tax
profit plummeted 62 percent to $69.3 million on sales of $6.2
billion, largely because of a restructuring charge associated with
the sale of its Godfather's Pizza chain and a number of other
restaurant operations and consolidations.
   Pillsbury, which started as Pillsbury Flour Mills with a single
flour mill in Minneapolis in 1869, makes Pillsbury flour, Green
Giant vegetables, Haagen Dazs ice cream and a variety of other
products.
   In addition to Burger King, Pillsbury owns the Bennigan's and
Steak & Ale restaurant chains, which Grand Met has said it would
sell. Pillsbury employs 100,000 people.
   Grand Met is a British real estate, liquor and gambling
conglomerate. Its U.S. holdings include Alpo dog food and Pearle
Vision Centers.

   The stock market pushed ahead today for the third
consecutive session, taking some encouragement from a new inflation
report.
   Trading was more active than in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 21.97 points
on Monday, was up another 8.93 at 2,181.61 at noon on Wall Street.
   That approached its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 set Oct.
21.
   Advancing issues led decliners by 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 711 issues up, 578 down
and 578 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 82.05 million shares at noontime
compared with 76.23 million shares at the same point on Monday.
   The market appeared to take some encouragement from a pair of
economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and moderate
economic growth.
   The government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent
in November, a smaller rise than some analysts expected.
   In another report, the government lowered its estimate of
economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent
from 2.6 percent.
   ``The numbers were pleasantly in line with Street expectations,
and gave some confidence to the market,'' said Jack Baker, head of
equity bloick trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The reports contributed to a rally in the credit markets, where
prices of some long-term bonds were up by as much as $9 for every
$1,000 in face value while interest rates pulled back.
   But while some analysts say the conditions are right for a
year-end stock rally, others said the recent gains may be
short-lived.
   The skeptics note that short-term interest rates near 9 percent
are making Treasury issues such as one-year bills attractive
compared with the uncertain yields on stocks.
   International Business Machines was the most active issue in the
early going on the NYSE, rising 1[ to 123~.
   Elsewhere in the technology group, Digital Equipment was up | at

   A federal judge blocked a federal plan to
require random drug testing of 3 million interstate drivers
nationwide but did allow pre-employment and post-accident testing.
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel issued a temporary
restraining order Monday against random drug testing of truckers and
interstate bus drivers. She told government lawyers she wanted to
review how widespread substance abuse is in the trucking industry
before a future hearing.
   The material published in the Federal Register in support of
testing amounted to nothing more than ``a well-taken diatribe
against drug abuse in American society,'' Patel.
   The program was to start Wednesday, but the Transportation
Department did not require companies to conduct any actual testing
until next December, according to department spokesman Bob Marks.
   More than 1 million other private employees in the rail, airline
and maritime industries are scheduled to begin random testing.
   The order expires Dec. 30, when Patel is scheduled to hear
arguments on a longer-lasting injunction against all testing
programs affecting truckers and interstate bus drivers.
   Marks declined to comment on Patel's ruling, saying the
government would present its side on Dec. 30.
   Jeffrey King, lawyer for the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers
Association of America, which challenged the testing program, said
drug abuse among truck drivers ``is probably below the national
average.''
   ``There's no basis to think there's a severe problem,'' King told
reporters. He said random drug testing would sacrifice ``the rights
of millions of truck drivers ... in hopes of catching a few.''
   King said his organization, which has 9,000 members, sued on
behalf of all 300,000 independent owners of heavy-duty trucks and
small truck fleets. He said Patel's order applies to all interstate
truck and bus drivers, but not to inter-city bus drivers, who have
separate drug testing regulations.
   King said he hoped to reach agreement with government lawyers on
an extension of the ban on random drug testing before the temporary
restraining order expires.
   The Transportation Department testing program was announced Nov.
14. Transportation Secretary James Burnley said at the time that
transportation employees were no more immune from drug abuse than
the rest of society, listing a series of accidents and other
evidence.

<HEAD>EEC Asks GATT Council For Support In Hormones Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community on Tuesday called
for a GATT Council ruling in the dispute over the EEC ban on
hormone-treated meat which is to take effect Jan.1 and threatens to
trigger a trade war with the United States.
   The United States immediately opposed the request, saying the EEC
sought an ``instantanous legal finding'' that had no basis under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The EEC representative, John Beck, told the GATT Council that the
threatened U.S. retaliatory measures, a 100 percent punitive duty on
a range of products, were a ``further affront against the
multilateral trade system'' set up by the GATT.
   He said the case had wide ramifications and urged the council to
rule on the legal issues involved and decide on remedies.
   A top U.S. trade negotiator, Michael Samuels, said the EEC ban
amounted to a ``unilateral decision to simply prohibit $120 million
in U.S. exports per year.'' He said it was a ``wholesale disruption
of traditional trade flows'' on alleged grounds of health but that
the measure was not backed up by scientific evidence.
   Samuels said the EEC had repeatedly rejected proposals to have
the case examined by an impartial scientific body. He said the
United States remained willing to pursue the matter under any
appropriate GATT process as long as the EEC deferred the ban.
   Beck said the EEC was aware that there were different views on
the use of growth hormones in meat but that it had to ``listen to
its consumers'' who did not want such meat.
   Canada supported the United States, saying that it considered the
EEC approach excessive. Robert Wright, the Canadian representative,
said in the brief debate that growth hormones were proven to be safe
if used properly.
   There was no decision on the EEC request and the matter was
expected to come up again at the next GATT Council session in
February.
   In other business, Brazil formally demanded that a GATT panel be
set up to rule in its dispute with the United States over punitive
U.S. duties imposed in response to an alleged lack of Brazilian
patent protection for U.S. pharmaceutical products.
   Brazilian ambassador Rubens Ricupero said the U.S. retaliation
was in clear violation of GATT rules and in breach of commitments
not to impose new unilateral trade restrictions during the current
Uruguay round of world trade liberalization talks.
   Samuels said there had been no alternative left to defending
legitimate U.S. interests but that the measures would be lifted as
soon as Brazil acts upon the U.S. request to ensure full patent
proection.
   The measures cover $39 million worth of Brazil's trade with the
United States, an amount which Samuels said reflects the damage
suffered by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.
   Twenty-eight countries backed Brazil's position, including the
EEC and Switzerland, which said also that the case argued for action
on patents in the Uruguay round talks.
   As the United States opposed the Brazilian request up a panel,
the council did not take a decision but was expected to discuss the
case again at its February session.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London stock exchange finished
a listless session higher Tuesday, as an optimistic start to Wall
Street and better-than-expected British money supply figures helped
fuel a bit of buying interest.
   However, traders cautioned that activity was still light as
players attention focused on the holidays and Friday's release of
British trade figures for November.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 6.9
points, or 0.4 percent, stronger at 1,777.4.
   Equities rose following news that Britain's money supply grew
more slowly than expected, which dealers said is another sign that
the British economy is finally beginning to slow down and that
interest rates might not have to be nudged higher in the near future
to quell an overheating economy.
   Britain's narrow money supply M-0, which consists of notes and
coins in circulation plus banks' operational balances with the Bank
of England, rose an estimated 0.2 percent in November. The markets
had expected a gain of between 0.3 percent and 1.3 percent.
   Volume was a moderate 331.6 million shares, compared with the
403.8 million shares that changed hands Monday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 10 points at 2,182.68 by
the close of the London session.

<TEXT>
   Curt Carlson, 74, recently stepped up the pace.
Rather than growing his business at just 15 percent a year, which
would double volume in five years, he publicly announced a goal of
17.5 percent a year.
   At that rate Carlson Cos., a personally owned 75-company
conglomerate based in Minnetonka, Minn., would double its annual
volume to $9 billion in 1992. Already, it is as large as some
Fortune 100 companies.
   Unlike such companies, however, Carlson remains entrepreneurial,
constantly setting sales goals, publicly stating them so that there
is no retreat, then setting new goals. It has never missed a
five-year sales goal.
   Curtis LeRoy Carlson was selling soap to grocery stores in 1938
when he founded Gold Bond Stamp Co. Constantly diversifying into
other businesses, restlessly setting goals, he pushed company sales
to $1 billion in 1978.
   Averaged out over the 40 years, that growth came to 33 percent a
year compounded. The company was huge now, and growth of that sort
doesn't come as easily as in the smaller days. For one thing, you
have to seek public funds.
   So, said Carlson, in 1978 he thought it best to ``settle'' for 15
percent a year for the next five years. In 1982 sales reached $2
billion. Another 15 percent five-year plan began. In 1987 the
company reached $4 billion.
   Ever the entrepreneur, Carlson then looked at his cash flow and
decided there was enough money coming in to step up the pace to 17.5
percent. That's the goal each year through 1992. There's no resting
at Carlson Cos.
   The conglomerate now has four major divisions: hospitality,
incentives, travel and promotion. Among the companies are the highly
rated Radisson hotel chain, TGI Friday's restaurants, Ask Mr. Foster
Travel Service, the oldest and largest in America, E.F. MacDonald's
incentive travel, Carlson Learning Co.
   It is forever in transition, continually evolving. In its
evolution the company follows no rigid plan, says Carlson. ``I hire
top people and they grow the company,'' he says. ``We're pulled
ahead by big horses.''
   Enthusiasm, imagination, innovation and motivation are important
elements in Carlson's type of management, and goal-setting is basic
to all of them. It began with little self-reminders in Curt's
wallet. Now it's institutionalized.
   ``To succeed you must eat, sleep and dream your goals and
quotas,'' he says. ``It's a fact, an absolute fact: You will never
make as much progress without targets as you will with goal
setting.''
   Nevertheless, he calls himself cautious. He seeks to grow in
``bite sizes; I don't shoot the wad.'' That way, if things don't
turn out as expected, ``you get a little blip in the earnings that
can be corrected.''
   Incentives spur achievement, and Carlson officers who achieve are
given such things as first-class, 17-day tours of Hawaii, New
Zealand and Australia. Throughout the year spouses are kept informed
of how well their mates are doing. Not wanting to be left out, they
spur their mates to higher achievement.
   The company remains the very same as it was 50 years ago in at
least one respect: it is sales driven. ``You build as fast as you
can,'' said Carlson the other day. ``As soon as a salesman is making
his pay you put on another.''
   Every month Carlson examines the income statement and balance
sheet for each of the 75 companies. He watches the bottom line, the
pursuit of goals. Should he suspect problems, he asks for backup
information and explanations.
   So successful are the Carlson management techniques that some of
his people would set _ and probably reach _ even higher goals. But,
says Carlson, ``you can only grow as fast as the money comes in.''
   To open a new Friday's, for example, might take $2 million. ``I
cannot open 40 of them without taking money away from others.'' In a
sense, therefore, the big growth goals are probably compromises.
   Perhaps its just as well because the goals are always publicly
stated. As a consequence, they are avidly watched by the media. Fail
to achieve a goal and everyone in town will know about it.
   ``You burn your bridges behind you,'' said Carlson the magic
motivator. ``We give a figure and we had better make it, because
everyone is watching.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices posted
across-the-board losses Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The markets opened under pressure because of profit-taking in the
wake of Monday's surprisingly strong showing.
   Traders said overnight rain in the soybean growing regions of
Brazil helped keep the lid tight. And even corn was unable to post
gains, despite an announcement the Soviets had bought 750,000 tons
of corn, and were expected back to announce a second purchase of the
same size after Tuesday's close.
   ``We were overdue for a correction,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``There was no fresh news to
move things and everybody felt the dramatic rises of the last few
sessions had reached their top.''
   On the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to { cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.34{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 3{ cents lower, with December at $2.67 a bushel; oats were
4 cents to 5 cents lower, with December at $2.21 a bushel; and
soybeans were 3\ cents to 7 cents lower, with January at $7.86 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Sales Up At Oldest, Largest Book Club</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID S. MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MECHANICSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees are packing last-minute
Christmas orders at the huge warehouse belonging to
Book-of-the-Month Club Inc. in the final chapter of a best-selling
year for the company.
   Lawrence M. Crutcher, president of the nation's largest book
club, said orders for 2 million books in December will help produce
annual sales of about $200 million, up 12 percent from last year.
   ``We had a long, slow start but it has been a good fall,''
Crutcher said Monday in an interview at the mammoth facility just
south of Harrisburg.
   As a subsidiary of Time Inc., Book-of-the-Month Club does not
reveal exact sales figures for its books, videotapes or casettes.
   But Crutcher said the club received about 3 million book orders
in November, at the height of the Christmas rush, prompting the
company to increase its workforce from 600 to 800.
   He attributed the surge partly to the release of many of the
year's best books late in the fall and partly to the holiday crunch.
Fifteen percent to 20 percent of Book-of-the-Month Club sales are
gifts, Crutcher said.
   ``We've pretty well dug out from the orders. We caught up last
week,'' he said.
   Book-of-the-Month Club, founded in 1926 with 4,000 charter
members, now has 2.7 million members.
   In addition to the main book club, the company offers seven
speciality clubs for readers with interests in business, cooking,
history, sailing, mystery novels, children's books and paperbacks.
   Book-of-the-Month Club also has been moving into the videotape
market in recent years, often marketing videos as companions to
books the club offers, Crutcher said.
   In February, for instance, Book-of-the-Month Club plans to offer
two videos about Martin Luther King along with the month's main
selection of ``Parting the Waters,'' a new book on the civil rights
movement.
   Videos and audio cassettes now account for about 5 percent of the
book club's business, Crutcher said.
   ``They are not a substitution sale. A lot of us have been nervous
about this ... (but) it hasn't hurt book sales,'' he said.
   Book-of-the-Month Club's sales have more than tripled in the last
20 years, showing that reading is alive and well, Crutcher said.
   Crutcher, who will become chief executive officer in January,
said the threefold increase of college graduates since World War II,
to about 23 percent of the population, has helped the company's
growth.
   ``It's not as explosive as cable TV, but it's a good growth
business,'' he said.
   During a reporter's visit recently to Book-of-the-Month Club's
labryinth of offices, employees were answering telephones,
processing checks and sorting the 150,000 to 200,000 pieces of mail
the club has been receiving daily.
   Workers also stacked books in a three-stories high warehouse
holding from 8 million to 10 million volumes on metal scaffolds
stretching hundreds of yards.
   ``If you can't find something in here you enjoy reading, you
can't find it anywhere,'' said Marty Mehring, human resources
manager at the plant.
   Orders received Monday will probably reach the buyer by
Christmas, according to Crutcher, who said 99 percent of the orders
received are processed within 24 hours.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 132.42 million shares at 3 p.m.
on Wall Street compared with 124.10 million shares at the same point
on Monday.
   The market appeared to take some early encouragement from a pair
of economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and moderate
economic growth.
   The government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent
in November, and lowered its estimate of economic growth in the
July-through-September period to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent.
   The reports contributed to a rally in the credit markets, where
prices of some long-term bonds were up by as much as $8.75 for every
$1,000 in face value while interest rates pulled back.
   But analysts said profit-taking eroded some of the stock market's
early gains, and some observers warned the recent rally may be
short-lived.
   The skeptics note that short-term interest rates near 9 percent
are making Treasury issues such as one-year bills attractive
compared with the uncertain yields on stocks.

<HEAD>Bush to Name Laxalt, Ashley to National Economic Commission</HEAD>

   President-elect Bush today selected former
Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, a Republican, and former Ohio Rep. Thomas
L. Ashley, a Democrat, as his representatives on the 14-member
National Economic Commission, Bush transition sources said.
   Earlier, Bush canceled plans for announcing new Cabinet
appointments today after the leading contender for secretary of
health and human services was quoted as saying he favored a woman's
right to an abortion.
   The economic commission is seeking to find a bipartisan solution
to the federal budget deficit. The panel was created by Congress
last year after the stock market plunge.
   Ashley is a longtime friend of the vice president's and is
currently president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, a
lobbying group which represents the country's largest banks.
   Laxalt, a close friend of President Reagan, is former general
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   As for the Cabinet, comments by medical educator Louis Sullivan
over the weekend in an Atlanta newspaper resulted in an unexpected
snag in his selection by Bush to head the sprawling Department of
Health and Human Services, transition sources said.
   Bush canceled a scheduled 2 p.m. announcement of Cabinet choices.
   He had been poised to name Chicago mass transit official Samuel
Skinner as his transportation secretary, and sources had said an
additional appointment had been likely, to add the first black to
the new Cabinet.
   Two blacks have been in line for Cabinet posts, according to
sources who spoke only on the condition of anonymity: Sullivan and
retired three-star Army Gen. Julius W. Becton.
   The Atlanta Journal and Constittion reported Sunday that
Sullivan, president of Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, said
in an interview that he supported a woman's right to choose to have
an abortion.
   That appeared to be at odds with a statement released by Bush's
transition office last week after the two men met in Washington. The
statement said Sullivan had assured the vice president he shared
Bush's anti-abortion views.
   Even though Sullivan, a friend of Bush and his wife, was reported
to have said that he, like Bush, opposes the use of federal funds
for abortions, the weekend interview threw an obstacle in his path
to the Cabinet, transition and congressional sources said.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported today that Sullivan had said
Monday night he was having trouble getting calls to the White House
returned.
   ``I have simply concluded that, as a result of my not receiving a
call back, the things have been put off, and hopefully it's not
anything worse than that.''
   Sullivan told the newspaper his stand on abortion is private and
he does not intend to disagree publicly with Bush's anti-abortion
views.
   He said he believes ``there should be that right (to abortions).
... At the same time, I am aware of the fact that the
president-elect feels that that should not be the case, and I would
have to, as secretary, should I be appointed, carry out his
policies.''
   A Bush transition official said that Bush had not formally
offered the post to Sullivan, despite widespread speculation and
despite Sullivan's own comments.
   The appointment of Jack Kemp to head the Housing and Urban
Development Department was announced Monday, cheering conservatives
who have long viewed the New York congressman as a champion of their
causes. But Kemp said he does not plan to be conservative in
approach when it comes to fighting for housing programs that work.
   ``I want to wage war on poverty. I don't want to wage war on
Congress,'' the nine-term congressman said. ``I want it known that
you cannot balance the budget off the backs of the poor.''
   Bush called Kemp, a former rival for the Republican presidential
nomination, a ``man of ideas'' who will lead his administration's
war on poverty.
   Asked if he had assurances that the former professional football
quarterback would shed his critic's role, Bush said: ``I hope he
hasn't shed it. ...I want the objectivity of his judgment, and
knowing Jack, I'll get it.''
   Kemp long has been an advocate of urban enterprise zones to spur
investment in inner cities and has called for selling public housing
units to tenants at low cost. He said he would be an activist HUD
secretary.
   As of Monday, the vice president had filled eight Cabinet posts
and had six to go.
   His prospective choice for transportation secretary, Skinner, is
chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern
Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation system.
   A former U.S. attorney in Chicago and a pilot, Skinner, 50, was
Bush's campaign director for Illinois.
   Meanwhile, sources said Bush was also ready to name Becton as
secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, an agency recently
raised to Cabinet level. Becton currently heads the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   Bush, who has said he hopes to finish his Cabinet by Christmas,
also has yet to name his secretaries of labor, interior and energy.
   Sources said the two leading candidates for the labor slot are
Patricia Diaz Dennis, a Democrat and member of the Federal
Communications Commission who once served on the National Labor
Relations Board; and William Kilberg, a Washington labor lawyer and
solicitor in the Labor Department under President Nixon.
   Bush on Monday did give some hints on his choice of energy
secretary, suggesting he is ``leaning more towards'' someone with
experience in nuclear energy rather than one with expertise in the
oil and gas industry.
   He did not elaborate, but the disclosure seemed to knock some
contenders out of consideration, including former Louisiana Rep.
Henson Moore.

   Continental Airlines announced Tuesday it will
eliminate the advance purchase requirement on a popular excursion
fare for travel during the next two weeks.
   The change will allow more people to obtain a discount ticket for
holiday travel, a spokesman for the airline said.
   Continental is eliminating the seven-day advance purchase
requirement on a category of excursion fares that is discounted up
to 70 percent from full economy-class fares for those traveling
between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4.
   A round-trip purchase and a Saturday night stay are required, and
a 25 percent cancellation charge applies.
   Although the seats available at the fares are limited and may not
remain on every flight, they are widely available for travel on most
U.S. routes throughout the holiday period, said the spokesman for
Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.

   President-elect Bush, emphasizing his
opposition to tax increases, appointed Republican Paul Laxalt and
Democrat Thomas Ashley on Tuesday to a national commission
struggling to find a formula for reducing the federal budget deficit.
   ``I intend to hold the line on taxes,'' Bush said. ``There are a
lot of people around saying I can't do that.''
   Laxalt, onetime governor of Nevada, served two terms in the U.S.
Senate before joining a Washington law firm. Ashley, a longtime
personal friend of Bush's, spent 26 years in the House of
Representatives and was a top-ranking member of the Banking
Committee. He now is president of the Association of Bank Holding
Companies, a lobbying group which represents the country's largest
banks.
   The appointments put the National Economic Commission at its full
strength of 14 people. The panel was created last year after the
stock market's 508-point plunge.
   Some business leaders said Laxalt's appointment diminished the
possibility that the commission would recommend tax increases to cut
the deficit.
   ``Laxalt is the type of guy who has read George Bush's lips, and
from everything I know about him he would be against taxes and would
want to look on the spending side for deficit reductions,'' said
Richard Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``He
has been a good fiscal conservative.''
   Tempering skepticism that he voiced earlier, Bush said, ``Some
have suggested I am something less than enthralled with the National
Economic Commission. That's not right.''
   Bush, who takes office on Jan. 20, made that comment in a meeting
with about 30 business leaders who pledged their support for a
program of reducing the deficit by cutting spending rather than
raising taxes. He issued a written statement later announcing the
appointment of Laxalt and Ashley.
   He noted that his announcement came only one day after the
Electoral College ratified the Nov. 8 vote electing him president.
``The swiftness with which I am making these appointments
underscores the importance I place on the need to reduce the federal
budget deficit,'' he said.
   ``I believe that the experience these two public servants will
bring to the panel will add to the quality of its deliberations,''
he said.
   At the beginning of the meeting with the business leaders, Bush
called the deficit a tough problem.
   ``I'll just do my level best to send signals to the international
markets that we're serious, that we're projecting it downward
firmly, and I really believe that once that happens the adverse
psychology that is forcing interest rates up beyond where in my view
they ought to be will turn around,'' he said.
   ``I think once world markets think that we're definitively on a
track without exception to have the deficit obliterated in whatever
number of years it is, that in itself _ a bipartisan answer _ that
in itself will be enormously beneficial to world markets,'' he said.
   In the past, Bush has appeared suspicious of the National
Economic Commission, warning that it might try to promote a
tax-increase plan to cut the deficit.
   But Bush said Tuesday he was looking forward to hearing from the
group and listening to its suggestions. ``There are some very good
people on there, Democrats and Republicans. They're serious, serious
people. ... So I'm not looking for a battle with the them and there
won't be one because they've been most cooperative since the
election in terms of wanting to at least have from our key economic
appointees their views.''

   There is just too much good economic news around
to suit the economic pessimists, and it has got to stop soon or
they'll have to re-evaluate their scenarios.
   The good news is coming from every direction, from the Commerce
Department and consumers and retailers and purchasing agents and
even from the Federal Reserve Board, which deferred an expected
increase in the discount rate.
   The latest retail sales showed a 1.1 percent improvement in
November. Car sales were good. Housing construction was at the
highest rate in seven months. The purchasing agents foresee strong,
non-inflationary growth in 1989.
   The November report on producer prices shows they rose only
three-tenths of 1 percent for the third month in a row. Even though
they probed deeply into the guts of the report, inflation-fearers
found little grist for their mill.
   The latest and broadest measurement of the U.S. trade deficit
showed a sharp improvement in the third quarter of the year,
reducing the gap to its narrowest in three years.
   It might seem hard to argue with items such as these, but that is
not so. There is a peculiar attitude toward good news today, the
commonest one being that good news is bad because it will bring on
inflation and recession.
   Never mind that neither is in sight. Just remember, if you will,
that in the view of some economists inflation and recession are
ever-present threats even in the best of times. Like sin, they
attack the weak and unprepared.
   That being so, you must forever flagellate the economy during
good times in order to ward off the threat. The economy should not
be indulged, because it is inherently weak and subject to excesses
that can destroy it. Beware.
   In this environment, improved retail sales are viewed as an
indication of an economy overheating and heading toward inflation.
   News of the improved trade deficit had been broadcast only
minutes when the oil analysts warned that higher prices for that
product would slow and even reverse the improvement.
   The continued lowering of the jobless rate, and the continued
expansion of the work force, the pessimists said, was very, very
dangerous. When you reach jobless levels of 5 percent to 5.5
percent, they say, wages soon will rise.
   Sharply rising wages would mean inflation, of course, and so
would a continued high level for plant usage. When you use up your
most efficient plant space you can't make more goods except at a
higher price. Beware.
   The latest report by the National Association of Purchasing
Management, in which members overwhelmingly say the economy will
improve next year, was said to be naive.
   Higher car sales just can't continue without rebates, said some
of the auto analysts. The news of heightened activity in housing was
immediately followed by economists warning that high interest rates
would put that to an end.
   There are enormous problems facing the U.S. economy _ budget
deficits, trade deficits, low savings rates, excessive and probably
very poor credit, banking problems, tax and revenue issues, the
dollar, competitiveness ...
   So why is the news about people working, companies producing,
deficits shrinking, prices remaining constant and houses abuilding
accompanied by warnings?
   Sooner or later the inflation and recession watchers will have
their way, because economies are cyclical. Expansions follow and
precede contractions. The lines on the graph waver; seldom are they
straight, as in straight up.
   The inflation-recession watchers know this, and they know, too,
that you do not worry enough about it. They feel they must atone for
your inattention to worry. Their motto is, ``If you only knew, you'd
worry more.''
   Seven years of uninterrupted economic expansion has left them
dismayed, disturbed and disgruntled, and habitually inclined to
growl, ``Bah, humbug.''
   And so at Christmas, say the good people of America, ``The same
to you.''

   An encouraging report on inflation Tuesday added
a spark of life to some financial markets and eased concerns about
higher interest rates, but most analysts remained wary about the
economy's direction.
   The dollar rallied against most major currencies in foreign
exchange trading here and abroad, while bond prices headed sharply
higher.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue rose nearly $10 per
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves inversely to price,
fell below 9 percent for the first time in a week.
   On Wall Street, however, stocks declined. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials, which shot up around 14 points at the opening,
closed down 6.61 to 2,166.07.
   Economists said the markets were encouraged by a Labor Department
report that showed inflation on the consumer level slowed in
November to an annual rate of just 3 percent. A drop in clothing
prices and stabilized prices for food contributed to the decline,
the department said.
   With only December left, another month similar to November could
enable the Reagan administration to finish its last year in office
meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988, down slightly
from 1987's 4.4 percent level.
   Also easing inflation worries was a Commerce Department report
that the gross national product _ the broadest measure of economic
health _ expanded at a moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent in the
third quarter due to the summer drought.
   For the same period, the department reported that after-tax
corporate profits rose 3.9 percent, down from a robust 8.9 percent
increase the previous quarter.
   ``Low inflation is good for all the markets. It means the
(economic) recovery was sustainable and long-lived,'' said Maury
Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber Inc.
   It eases the pressure on interest rates, which have risen sharply
in recent weeks partly on inflationary fears.
   Inflation is considered the nemesis of the financial markets,
particularly the credit markets, because it erodes the value of
fixed-income securities, sending yields higher to compensate for the
loss.
   That depresses the stock market, which competes for investor
money. And it often hurts the dollar because as prices of stocks and
bonds slip, foreigners become less willing to exchange their
currencies for dollars to buy those U.S. securities.
   Talk around Wall Street lately had centered around whether the
Federal Reserve will raise its discount rate, a key short-term rate,
to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from heading
up.
   The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to
member banks and savings institutions, and it's considered the most
direct vehicle for the central bank to make its credit policies
known. Most economists had predicted the rate would be raised 0.5
percentage point to 7 percent.
   However, Tuesday's inflation and GNP reports put some of those
discussions to rest, at least temporarily.
   ``Some people who jumped on the interest-rates-going-up,
fed-tightening bandwagon found out they were going on it
prematurely,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's what the markets are
telling you.''
   Carol A. Stone, a senior economist for Nomura Securities
International Inc., admits she was part of that majority group.
   ``We had expected that given the strength in some of the other
economic numbers lately that we'd see the Fed raising the discount
rate pretty soon,'' she said. ``Well this (economic data) suggests
that they may not have to do that right away, although there's still
a good possibility after the first of the year that we'd see that
happen.''
   ``There are some people that are ... expecting a rise in the
discount rate and the (bank's) prime rate before year's end,'' added
Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Brusca said that while the latest reports point to less inflation
and slightly slower economic growth, ``a laundry list'' of other
factors point in another direction.
   ``The dollar remains weak overall, (business) capacity use rates
are high and rising, and we have a very low unemployment rate,'' he
said. ``Oil prices are also rising.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most tolls on the St. Lawrence Seaway will
increase by 4.5 percent in each of the next two years, officials of
the binational waterway said Tuesday.
   The higher tolls being levied in 1989 and 1990 are needed to help
the system keep pace with inflation, said U.S. Seaway Administrator
James L. Emery and William A. O'Neil, president of the Seaway
Authority of Canada.
   However, tolls for humanitarian-aid shipments will be eliminated
and lumber shipments will be reclassified as bulk cargo and
therefore have a lower toll, officials said. These moves are
intended to spur increased movement of those two cargos.
   The combined toll for general cargo on the seaway in 1989 is
$2.86 per metric ton, while the rate for bulk cargo is $1.33 per ton.
   To be qualify for the lower rate, the lumber must be timber or
logs, sawed or split and rough or dressed into various sizes for use
as beams, joists, rafters, studs, boards of planks.
   ``There is an abundance of forest land and wood product
industries in the western Great Lakes region,'' O'Neil said. ``The
seaway is a natural transportation route for this virtually untapped
market.''
   However, he said the seaway handled only 9,400 metric tons of
lumber shipments in 1987, and the U.S. and Canadian agencies are
hoping for a significant increase in the amount of lumber shipped
through the system.

   Prime Computer Inc. may lay off 200 to 1,000
employees in the next six months as it restructures its sales and
marketing staff following a recent acquisition, it was reported
Wednesday.
   Speculation about layoffs has been fueled by a recent
announcement that the Natick takeover target, which acquired
Computervision in February, intends to organize its sales and
marketing operations into three geographical regions, according to
The Boston Herald and the Middlesex News in Framingham.
   The three regions would be the Americas; Europe, Africa and the
Middle East; and the Asian-Pacific.
   Rickard Eckel, a Prime spokesman, would say only, ``We cannot
rule out the elimination of positions in the future as the
integration continues.''
   Prime is the target of a hostile $970 million takeover bid by MAI
Basic Four Inc. Analysts say Prime's layoffs could help the firm
build up its defenses by cutting costs.

   The dollar rose Tuesday, strengthened by yearend

   Gold prices fell marginally in New York after mostly rising
abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted bullion at $413.90

   Currency strategists attributed the dollar's rise largely to
orders for the currency from U.S.-based multinationals preparing to
repatriate 1988 earnings.
   ``There is always good corporate demand for dollars in the last
couple of weeks of the year,'' said Stuart Yannalfo, senior foreign
exchange trader at Refco Inc., a New York commodities futures firm.
   Others said persistent speculation that the Federal Reserve would
tighten interest rates in the United States raised demand for
dollars. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated holdings
worth more.
   In addition, an oil price hike in the energy markets supported
the U.S. currency, since most oil contracts are priced in dollars. A
rise in oil prices theoretically raises demand for dollars to pay
for the oil.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.70 Japanese yen, up from
124.02. The dollar traded higher in London at 125.05 yen. By the
time trading ended in New York the dollar fetched 125.33 yen, up
from 124.08 yen late Monday.
   In London the British pound cost $1.8070 late Tuesday, cheaper
for buyers than $1.8230 late Monday. In New York the pound cost
$1.7957, down from $1.8209 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with rates late
Monday: 1.7803 West German marks, up from 1.7645; 1.5035 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4891; 1.2025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1998;
6.0813 French francs, up from 6.0270; and 1,310.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,300.75.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday:
1.7750 marks, up from 1.7625; 1.4995 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870;
6.0675 French francs, up from 6.0235; 2.0080 Dutch guilders, up from

   In gold trading, bullion for current delivery fell 40 cents a
troy ounce to $414 on the New York Commodity Exchange. Earlier in
London, prices remained unchanged at $414.25. In Zurich gold rose
$1.25 to $413.50 and in Hong Kong it rose 5 cents to $415.67.

<HEAD>Economic, Market Factors Play Scrooge At Britain's Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High interest rates and slumping financial markets
are casting Scrooge's shadow over Christmas for many British
businesses and workers.
   Retailers say high interest rates _ the government's strategy for
fighting inflation _ are depressing sales and prompting pre-holiday
price markdowns.
   Industrial companies say their profits are feeling a pinch too,
and investment firms have made major layoffs in the face of low
trading volumes and fierce competition.
   The good news is that recent economic reports show the higher
interest rates are beginning to slow the overheating economy. That
means rates might not go higher.
   The bad news is that retailers are weathering a slowdown at what
traditionally is one of the busiest times of the year.
   ``Trade is not what it usually is before Christmas. People are
being more cautious with their money because of higher interest
rates,'' said a spokeswoman for the Oxford Street Association, whose
120 members operate stores on London's main shopping street.
   Angela Mostaani, a 36-year-old secretary buying Christmas
wrapping paper, said higher interest rates were affecting her
shopping.
   ``We bought our first house in April, when the interest rate was
8 percent. I'm trying to buy less,'' Mrs. Mostaani said.
   To slow spending, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson pushed
interest rates to 13 percent from June's decade-low 7.5 percent.
Mortgage rates have risen to 12.75 percent from 11.5 percent and are
expected to reach 13.5 percent in January.
   The annual inflation rate has picked up to 6.4 percent from 3.3
percent in January.
   Paul Bayliss, a 30-year-old accountant shopping in the same store
as Mrs. Mostaani, also said he was worried about higher interest
rates, but added: ``We'll not let it spoil Christmas, anyway.''
   Some stores are taking pre-Christmas markdowns to move
merchandise: Liberty and Co., a clothing and fabrics retailer, said
it has reduced some women's designer clothes up to one-third.
   ``It's been a very difficult season for ladies fashions,'' said
Kathryn Dighton, a Liberty spokeswoman.
   But she added: ``We're experiencing a particularly good Christmas
season. We expect (sales) to be up between 12 percent and 14 percent
throughout the store.''
   Meanwhile, investment firms in the City, London's financial
district, are laying off people because of competition and low
trading volumes. The government's tight grip on spending also has
hurt the market in gilts, or British government bonds.
   Morgan Grenfell Group PLC announced Dec. 6 it was shutting its
gilt and equity market-making operations, cutting 450 jobs just
before the holidays.
   It was the biggest single cutback announced since the October
1987 stock market crash and Big Bang, the 1986 deregulation of
Britain's financial markets.
   Separately, the British textile group Coats Viyella PLC warned
Wednesday its pre-tax profit could fall as much as 40 percent in
1988, mostly because of high interest rates and the strong British
pound.
   But some Britons have been encouraged by three economic reports
released this past week which show the government's tactics appear
to be working.
   The government reported last Friday that the annual inflation
rate held steady at 6.4 percent in November.
   Last Thursday, it reported the underlying annual growth of
average earnings fell to 9 percent in October from 9.25 percent in
September. Earlier, it said retail sales fell 0.5 percent in
November.
   ``The retail sales figures we saw at the beginning of the week
were certainly helpful to show that demand is coming off a bit,''
said economist Derek Scott of the investment firm Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd.
   Economists now are expecting inflation to peak at between 7.25
percent and 7.5 percent next year rather than at 8 percent or
higher, Scott said.
   But he added: ``We won't really see evidence (of a slowdown)
until the New Year.''

<HEAD>Stocks Fall, Breaking Two-Day Rally</HEAD>

   Some late afternoon selling left stock prices
broadly lower Tuesday, frustrating the market's bid to extend its
latest rally.
   Prices opened higher, appearing to take some encouragement from
new government reports that indicated continuing low inflation and
moderate economic growth. But profit-taking eroded the gains as the
day progressed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen nearly
40 points over the past two sessions, wound up falling 6.61 to close
at 2,166.07.
   The widely-watched indicator of blue-chip stocks had been up
nearly 10 points at midday but gave ground steadily in the final
hour of the session.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
652 up, 845 down and 515 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.09 million
shares, down from 162.25 million Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 196.92 million shares.
   As the market opened, the Dow Jones industrials moved up about 14
points during the first few minutes of trading. But the blue-chip
market gauge was unable to sustain the advance, and soon dropped
below its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 reached Oct. 21.
   ``The early rally was a carryover from yesterday's strength,''
said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Prescott, Ball &
Turben Inc. in Cleveland. ``But the breadth of the market was poor.''
   Before trading began, the government reported the consumer price
index rose 0.3 percent in November, and lowered its estimate of
economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent
from 2.6 percent.
   The reports tended to soothe worries that the Federal Reserve
would move quickly to encourage even higher interest rates.
   The bond market rallied, as prices of some long-term issues rose
as much as $9 for every $1,000 in face value and interest rates fell.
   But analysts said profit-taking eroded some of the stock market's
early gains, driving prices lower.
   The skeptics noted that short-term interest rates are hovering
near 9 percent and are making yields on Treasury issues such as
one-year bills attractive compared with the uncertain yields on
stocks.
   Chalasani noted that the Dow Jones industrials have risen about
150 points since mid-November and said he suspects the year-end
rally may ``pretty much be over.''
   But Lawrence R. Helfand, executive vice president at Rodman &
Renshaw Inc. in Chicago, said the some further gains could be in
store if stocks other than the blue-chip issues attract some buying
interest.
   Inco Ltd., the Canadian metals mining company which began trading
ex-dividend recently, was the most active issue on the NYSE, rising
1\ to 26[. A company spokesman, Kurt Barnes, declined to speculate
about reasons for the price rise or activity.
   Among other active issues, J.P. Morgan lost { to 35}, Tiger
International slipped [ to 19} and American Telephone & Telegraph
fell { to 29{.
   International Business Machines rose { to 123\ and Hewlett
Packard rose 1{ to 53. But two other technology companies fell as
Digital Equipment lost 1 to 94 and Honeywell slipped \ to 60.
   First Fidelity Bancorp fell 1} to 26[. The company announced last
week it expected to lose $145 million to $190 million in the current
quarter, and some analysts suspect the company's financial problems
may not be over.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $8.975 billion, or 0.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.64 to 155.74.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.46 to 320.51, and S&P's
500-stock composite index lost 1.44 tp 277.47.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.34 to 376.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 299.67, up 0.97.

<HEAD>OECD Says West Should Take Steps to Combat Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western industrialized nations are likely to
experience moderately low inflation rates over the next two years,
but the threat of accelerated inflation and higher interest rates is
just over the horizon, the OECD said Tuesday.
   In the latest issue of its semi-annual Economic Outlook, the
secretariat of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development suggested that some tightening of fiscal policy, as well
as monetary policy, may be necessary in most countries to combat
inflationary pressures.
   The secretariat also predicted that the current-account trade
deficits of the three biggest OECD countries _ the United States,
Japan and West Germany _will remain unacceptably high.
   The Paris-based OECD cautioned that although there appears to be
no imminent problem, ``it would be unwise to conclude that external
(trade) imbalances no longer represent an important threat to
international financial stability.''
   The report says the real, or inflation-adjusted, rate of
expansion of western industrialized economies is likely to slow to
between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 1990 from 3.25 percent next
year. The expansion rate this year was 4 percent.
   Growth in the United States is expected to slow to 2.5 percent in
1990 from 3 percent in 1989 and 3.75 percent this year.
   The OECD also suggested that the dollar may strengthen against
other currencies in the short term, especially if the U.S. economy
continues to expand at a rapid pace.
   Japan's growth rate is expected to moderate from a robust 5.75
percent in 1988 to 4.5 percent in 1989 and 3.75 percent in 1990. The
outlook is similar in West Germany, where this year's growth rate of
3.75 percent is likely to decline to 2.5 percent in 1989, although
there may be a very slight pickup to 2.75 percent in 1990.
   The organization's chief economist, David Henderson, described
the overall picture for the OECD economies as ``rather encouraging.''

<HEAD>House Panel Members Voice Support For SEC Self-Funding Concept</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel voiced tentative support Tuesday
for a proposal to allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to
become self-financing by tapping millions of dollars in annual fees.
   The money would help boost the SEC's limited resources for such
battles as its securities fraud case against the giant investment
firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   SEC chairman David S. Ruder told a subcommittee hearing chaired
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., that the Drexel case dramatized the
paltry resources of his agency, where there is a 20 percent annual
turnover of staff lawyers who are lured to private firms by fatter
salaries and better working conditions.
   The SEC in September filed a civil suit charging Drexel and some
of its employees, including junk bond chief Michael Milken, with
insider trading, stock manipulation and other violations stemming
from the ongoing Wall Street insider trading scandal.
   The case has yet to go to court and Drexel has spent $75 million
in legal fees and nearly $70 million in public relations and
advertising costs _ more than the SEC's current budget of $142.6
million, the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations was told.
   Pitting little more than a dozen of the regulatory agency's
poorly paid lawyers against more than 100 high-priced Wall Street
attorneys representing Drexel ``is like trying to fight Godzilla
with a slingshot,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Ruder endorsed proposals in a new SEC staff study to allow the
agency to become self-financed by using the fees it collects for
securities registrations, transactions and various filings. These
fees, which totaled $248 million in fiscal 1988, are deposited in
the Treasury's general fund and are not available to the agency.
   Dingell said that in the past few years, fee revenues have been
more than double, or nearly double, the SEC's annual appropriation.
   ``It is my firm view that something must be done to address the
growing deficiencies in the resources available to the SEC to carry
out its statutory responsibilities,'' Dingell said. ``It is also my
view that something will be done.''
   Ruder and several subcommittee members agreed that the most
controversial proposal would be to create a permanent SEC trust and
revolving fund, financed by fee collections, which the agency could
spend under special authority of a congressional oversight committee.
   The self-financing concept drew praise from Democrats and
Republicans on the panel.
   Wyden cited the SEC's decision in September not to seek
prosecution of suspected securities violations in the $2.25 billion
default on municipal bonds issued by the Washington Public Power
Supply System because of a lack of enforcement staff.
   ``The lesson is, if you're going to mess up, mess up big,'' Wyden
said. ``The fact is, the SEC just doesn't have the resources to go
after these big cases.
   Ruder said a self-financing mechanism would give the SEC
flexibility to cope with the growing automation of securities
markets, increasingly complex financial packages and trading
techniques, sophiscated schemes for market manipulation and insider
trading, escalating corporate takeover attempts and the rapid growth
in U.S. and foreign securities markets.
   Enforcement of securities laws has suffered because of SEC staff
problems, such as starting salaries of $27,716 for young lawyers who
can command as much as $71,000 in New York law firms, Ruder said.
   ``We have evidence of cases we could bring but don't because we
don't have the resources to do it,'' Ruder said. He refused to cite
specifics, but said some of these cases involve ``penny stock
fraud'' perpetrated against small investors by ``boiler room
operations'' that move from city to city.
   In another matter, Ruder refused to comment on reports quoting
Drexel chief executive Fred Joseph that negotiations with federal
prosecutors had broken down and that his firm might be hit with a
criminal racketeering indictment soon.

<HEAD>Coffee Overflows Limit as Concerns Rise Over Dockworkers' Strike
in
Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices made their most dramatic surge in five
consecutive sessions of advances, overrunning the daily trading
limit Tuesday amid growing concerns over a lengthening strike by
dockworkers in Brazil.
   ``The longer the strike remains in place,'' said Arthur Stevenson
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``the more explosive this will
get.''
   On other markets, cocoa moved in sympathy with coffee and
registered sharp gains; platinum came off the floor and posted
moderate gains after three straight days of reverses; and the
January contract for crude oil futures skyrocketed $1.42 when the
brokerage arm of a large commodity trading house got caught selling
the market short on the day the contract expired.
   Coffee prices rocketed 10.35 cents and 10.58 cents for the spot
March and May contracts, respectively, and settled up the 6-cent
daily trading limit for the remaining deferred contracts at the New
York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. March closed at $1.5543 a
pound, a high for the contract.
   Stevenson said the single-biggest development Tuesday was a
report that a regional court near the key Brazilian port of Santos
affirmed the legality of the strike that began Dec. 13.
   But several other factors were underpinning coffee's dramatic
rise in recent days.
   ``There is concern about the production outlook ... insufficient
rain in some parts of Brazil (the world's largest producer) and too
much in Colombia,'' he said.
   ``And when you put those together, and then consider that the
court decision leaves the workers under less pressure to settle
quickly,'' he added, ``you've got the kind of explosive market we
saw today.''
   Cocoa, meanwhile, was up $58 to $82 a ton, with March at $1,524.
   ``It was the biggest day for cocoa in ages,'' said Stevenson.
``There was psychological spillover from the coffee pit and the port
strike has some impact there too.''
   ``And,'' he added, ``there is some indication the Ivory Coast
(the world's leading cocoa producer) is going to tighten supply by
removing some from the market.''
   Platinum climbed as high as $15 an ounce before settling $5 to
$6.50 an ounce higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
December contract closed at $535.80 _ a steep decline from the $600
level the precious metal topped last week before Ford Motor Corp.
announced it had developed an automotive catalytic converter that
did not require the use of platinum.
   ``People are coming back to platinum, but there are no bets how
this will go until we get a complete story,'' said Steve Chronowitz,
vice president and director of futures research for Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``How much will this actually cut demand? Will General Motors and
Chrysler and Europe and Japan follow suit? Those are questions we
won't know answers to for a while,'' he added. ``But the worst may
be over.''
   The rest of the precious metals were quiet. Gold settled 40 cents
to 50 cents lower at the Comex, with December at $414 a troy ounce;
silver 1.7 cents to 2.1 cents lower, with December at $6.093 a troy
ounce. Copper was .90 cent lower to 3.15 cents higher, with December
at $1.5890 a pound.
   Crude oil futures at the New York Mercantile Exchange rose only
by 10 cents to 38 cents _ except for the spot contract in January,
which jumped $1.42 to $17.73 a barrel jump,
   The spot-month aberration resulted because a brokerage firm,
rumored to be part of grain giant Cargill Inc., had sold the market
short _ expecting a drop in prices _ and was forced to buy contracts
to fulfill obligations on delivery day.
   ``Somebody got caught between tornadoes,'' said energy analyst
who declined to be identified, ``and had to buy like crazy. It seems
to happen every time delivery day comes along.''
   Heating oil settled 0.47 cent to 0.72 cent higher, with January
at 51.47 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was up 0.13 cent to
0.35 cent, with January at 45.55 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices posted across-the-board losses
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2{ cents lower, with December at $4.34{ a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 3{ cents lower, with December at $2.67
a bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 5 cents lower, with December at
$2.21 a bushel; and soybeans were 3} cents to 7 cents lower, with
January at $7.86{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .08 cent higher, with
December at 73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower
to .10 cent higher, with January at 83.82 cents a pound; live hogs
were .30 cent lower to 1.10 cents higher, with December at 45.74
cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .37
cent higher, with February at 45.52 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Reports Second Quarter Earnings Decline; Smith To Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. said Tuesday its profit fell 38
percent in its second quarter and 10 percent for the first half of
its fiscal year due to the costs of its unsuccessful battle against
hostile suitor Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Pillsbury said its net income in the three months ended Nov. 30
totaled $44.8 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $72.5
million, or 84 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Sales
rose to $1.75 billion from $1.69 billion.
   The food and restaurant company agreed Sunday to accept a
sweetened $5.68 billion takeover bid from the British conglomerate,
which had made its first offer on Oct. 4.
   Pillsbury said the profit decline was ``due to a substantial
one-time investment in the Burger King advertising fund and the cost
of responding'' to Grand Met's takeover bid.
   The Burger King investment reduced net earnings by $14.4 million,
or 17 cents per share, in the quarter, while after-tax costs related
to the tender offer totaled $13.2 million, or 15 cents per share,
the company said.
   Operating profit for restaurants fell to $4.2 million in the
quarter from $47.6 million a year ago. Included in the latest
quarter's results was a one-time investment of $23.4 million to
reduce the deficit in Burger King's advertising fund.
   Pillsbury's foods businesses reported operating profit of $132.8
million for the quarter, a 16 percent gain from the year-earlier
period.
   For the six months, the company's net earnings were $116.2
million, or $1.35 per share, vs. $129.3 million, or $1.50 per share,
during the comparable period last year. Sales rose to $3.23 billion
from $3.14 billion last year.
   For the six months, foods operating profit increased 25 percent
to $211 million, while restaurants operating profit fell by 56.3
percent to $52.9 million.
   Separately, Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith said he would
leave the company after Grand Met completes the buyout sometime this
winter.
   Smith, 54, former chairman of General Foods Corp., became
Pillsbury's president, chairman, and chief executive officer Aug. 1.
   ``There isn't a CEO (chief executive officer) I know that
wouldn't rather be running an independent company,'' Smith told the
Minneapolis Star Tribune. ``I felt there were significant
opportunities in Pillsbury, and my regret is that I won't be able to
bring those about.''
   After months of resistance, Pillsbury's board of directors
approved the buyout on Sunday after a judge in Delaware on Friday
blocked its two key takeover defenses, a ``poison pill'' stock issue
plan and the proposed spinoff of Miami-based Burger King.
   Grand Met will purchase all outstanding shares of Pillsbury
common stock for $66 per share in cash under an offer that expires
Jan. 3.
   Grand Met is a British real estate, liquor and gambling
conglomerate. Its U.S. holdings include Alpo dog food and Pearle
Vision Centers.

   A federal investigation of fraud at the ZZZZ
Best rug shampooing company continues despite the conviction of
owner Barry Minkow and his accountant, the U.S. attorney said
Tuesday.
   Investors in the company and other victims of its scams are
unlikely to get back any of the $65 million to $70 million that
disappeared into the firm, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner told a news
conference.
   ``It's a sad fact that in many of these fraud cases, there isn't
much left when it is all over,'' Bonner said. ``Certainly much of it
was dissipated on the lifestyle that Mr. Minkow led.''
   Minkow, 22, became familiar to millions of people through
appearances in television ads and talk shows, portraying himself to
the public and the investment community as a teen-age supersalesman
whose thriving company began in his parents' garage in the San
Fernando Valley.
   He was convicted last week of 57 counts of conspiracy, securities
fraud, mail fraud and credit card fraud.
   Jurors rejected his defense that Mafia figures had forced him to
swindle investors by falsely claiming his company was making a
fortune restoring fire- and water-damaged buildings.
   Minkow's accountant, Norman Rothberg, 52, was convicted Monday of
taking a bribe from Minkow to cover up the fraud. Ten others
connected with ZZZZ Best have pleaded guilty to various charges
since the firm collapsed in July 1987.
   Bonner said his office, the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service
were following leads that surfaced at the trial, including Minkow's
claims that he was forced into crime by mobsters who had interests
in his company.
   ``The full range of individuals who may have participated ... is
going to be looked into,'' Bonner said. ``We're not ruling out _ I
can't say that none of these figures have ties to organized crime.''
   Bonner and other officials at the news conference refused to say
who was under investigation, when charges might be forthcoming or
even if they were sure they would amass enough evidence for further
charges.
   Possible crimes connected with ZZZZ Best include tax fraud, bank
fraud and securities fraud through manipulation of the company's
stock price, Bonner said.
   The officials refused to comment on whether Minkow had discussed
helping in the investigation in return for a reduction in his
sentence, which could be a maximum of 403 years.
   Asked to comment on accusations by Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl
Gates that ZZZZ Best may have laundered money for East Coast
mobsters, the U.S. attorney said that aspect of the case was in the
hands of local authorities.
   ``There's certainly some smoke there,'' he said.
   The Police Department's top spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, said
this week that investigation continues.
   One of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger,
said that of the $65 million to $70 million believed invested in or
paid to ZZZZ Best, most seems to have been spent by the high-living
Minkow and other defendants. Virtually none appears to be available
for restitution to investors, bankers, brokers and other victims,
whom Minkow numbered in the thousands, Asperger said.

<HEAD>Company That Owns Happy Birthday Sold For $25 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As its own 100th birthday approaches, the song
``Happy Birthday to You'' is about to change owners.
   A spokesman for Warner Communications Inc. confirmed Tuesday that
the corporation's music publishing division has signed an agreement
to buy Birchtree Ltd., the Princeton, N.J. publishing company that
owns the birthday song.
   The spokesman, Geoffrey Holmes, refused to disclose the price of
the deal, but the New York Times reported Warner Chappell had agreed
to pay $25 million for Birchtree.
   ``I wouldn't have put that number on it,'' Holmes said, noting
that Birchtree has been valued at an estimated $12 million to $15
million. But he would not say the Times' account was wrong.
   Holmes said the sale would be completed next month. It will give
Warner Chappell the rights to the song until the year 2010, when the
copyright expires.
   Altogether, Birchtree owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700
are actively collecting royalty fees. Warner Chappell, the world's
largest music publisher, already owns the rights to songs by George
and Ira Gershwin, Michael Jackson and Cole Porter, among others.
   ``Happy Birthday,'' which is said to generate about $1 million in
royalties, is one of the three most popular songs in the English
language, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The
others are ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.''
   The song began as a classroom greeting _ ``Good Morning to You''
_ that was written in 1893 by two Louisville, Ky., kindergarten and
Sunday school teachers, Patty Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J.
Hill.
   The birthday lyrics were written later and the song was not
copyrighted until 1935.
   Birchtree was put up for sale in October, in part because the
company said it did not have the resources to monitor and protect
its copyrights as larger companies do, according to the Times.

   Holly Farms Corp. said Tuesday its
second-quarter earnings more than tripled while sales rose nearly 25
percent.
   Holly said that for the period ending Nov. 30, its earnings
totaled $22.2 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with $8.5 million,
or 49 cents a share, during the second quarter of 1987.
   The poultry and food processor said its sales totaled $479.4
million, up from $384.9 million.
   Profits for the six-month period ending Nov. 30 rose to $52
million, or $2.87 per share, compared with net income of $19.3
million, or $1.10 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 1987.
   First-half sales totaled $983.6 million, compared with $768.4
million.
   Holly Farms announced Nov. 17 it would accept a stock-swap offer
from ConAgra of Omaha, Neb., to avoid a $1.1 billion takeover bid by
Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark.
   Tyson has challenged the proposed merger, saying it cannot take
place as a planned pooling of interests, which occurs when companies
combine balance sheets after a merger leaving the original firm's
assets, liabilities and owners' equity relatively unchanged.
   Holly Farms has rejected cash offers of $52 and $54 a share from
Tyson.
   Holly Farms is the nation's second largest poultry processor,
while Tyson is the largest.

<TEXT>
   The Carlyle Group, a Washington investment and
banking firm, said Tuesday it had offered some $200 million cash for
the stock of aerospace manufacturer Fairchild Industries Inc. it
does not already own.
   Carlyle described the proposal as friendly and said its $15.50 a
share offer represented a premium of 53 percent of the closing
market price per share on July 25, 1988, when its general partner,
Carlyle Investors VI, began accumulating Fairchild shares.
   Carlyle Investors VI owns 9.9 percent of the outstanding shares
of Fairchild and is the second largest shareholder of record,
Carlyle said. Based on Fairchild's roughly 14.3 million common
shares outstanding, the offer is worth about $198.4 million for the
stock Carlyle does not already own.
   Fairchild stock closed unchanged at $13.37{ a share Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Fairchild, which is based in Chantilly, Va., is a designer and
maker of aerospace systems, components, plastics tooling and
communications equipment. The company posted a profit of $21.7
million, or $1.11 a share, on sales of $399.3 million in the first
nine months of this year.
   Carlyle said it made the offer Tuesday in a letter to Emanuel
Fthenakis, Fairchild's chairman.
   The Carlyle Group is a private investment and merchant banking
firm located in Washington. The Carlyle Group is the general partner
of Carlyle Investors VI, also a Delaware limited partnership.
   Two of the principal partners of the Carlyle Group are T. Rowe
Price and Associates, the Baltimore-based investment company, and
the Richard King Mellon family.

<HEAD>Texaco Unit To Pay $8.95 Million To Settle California Waste Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texaco Inc. subsidiary has agreed to
pay $8.95 million to settle a state complaint that it improperly
stored hazardous wastes at its Bakersfield facility, state officials
said Tuesday.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp and state Health Director
Kenneth Kizer called the settlement the largest ever reached under
California's hazardous waste law and possibly the biggest of its
kind in the country.
   ``The severity of the penalties imposed in this case are matched
by the seriousness of the violations and by the potential threat to
public health and safety,'' Van de Kamp said at a Capitol news
conference.
   He said state investigators found about 5,000 steel drums
containing hazardous waste at the Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc.
facility in northwest Bakersfield. About 2,000 of the drums were
leaking, corroded or open and more than 3,000 of them were not
labeled, he said.
   Van de Kamp and Kizer said they had no indication that the waste
had leaked into groundwater, but Van de Kamp said the situation at
the refinery could have been disasterous if there was a fire.
   Texaco spokesmen said the waste posed ``no significant risk to
either our employees, the environment or the community.'' They said
the company agreed to the settlement to avoid the costs of fighting
the case in court.
   ``While technically hazardous waste, the vast majority of the
materials were relatively inert and would not be considered to be
hazardous outside California,'' said Robert Hammond, a spokesman for
Texaco USA.
   ``Furthermore, procedures exist in the California regulations
under which Texaco could have sought and, we are confident, obtained
approvals from the Department of Health Services to treat most of
the material involved as non-hazardous.''
   Hammond and Bill Bresnick, an attorney for Texaco, said most of
the material stored in the drums already was there when Texaco
purchased property next to its facility from Tosco Corp. in 1986.
   Most of the drums have been removed, Texaco officials said. The
company is required to remove the remaining drums within 90 days,
state officials said.
   Under the settlement, Texaco Refining and Marketing will pay $4.5
million in civil penalties, $500,000 to cover administrative and
investigative costs and at least $3.95 million to reduce waste
production and improve waste handling procedures at its facilities.
   Kizer said the violations found by state inspectors included
storing waste for longer than allowed without a permit, storing
incompatible wastes next to each other, storing waste in unlabeled
containers, and storing waste in open and unsafe conditions.
   According to the complaint, the department first found improper
storage of waste at the site during a partial inspection in
September 1986. The complaint was filed last week.

<HEAD>Inflation, Economic Growth Both Held to Moderate 3 Percent Pace</HEAD>

rate used in announcement.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3 percent
last month and economic growth did the same in the third quarter,
the government said Tuesday in reports that eased fears an
overheating economy is about to trigger a wage-price spiral.
   Seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose just 0.25 percent in
November compared with a 0.4 percent increase in October, the Labor
Department said. Before the seasonal adjustments, prices rose only
0.1 percent.
   The monthly inflation figure was rounded off in the department's
announcement to 0.3 percent although the actual figure was 0.25
percent.
   Clothing prices that had jumped 4 percent in September and
October with the introduction of fall and winter fashions dipped 0.3
percent last month. And food prices showed no increase in November
for the first time since February.
   Analysts who had been seeing harbingers of inflation everywhere
in recent economic data described as ``amazing'' and ``remarkable''
the continued lack of it in the government's monthly report on the
Consumer Price Index.
   The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 percent
for the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the first 11
months, the same as it was for all of 1987.
   With only December left, another month similar to November could
enable the Reagan administration to finish its last year in office
meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988.
   ``It's amazing,'' said David Wyss, chief economist for Data
Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. ``We've gone
six years into an expansion and have the lowest unemployment in 14
years and there's no sign of inflation, at least at the consumer
level.''
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said inflation grew by about one-half percentage point in
late 1987 but ``has hung there ever since.''
   ``It's rather remarkable when you consider that capacity
utilization in factories is up and the labor market has gotten
tighter,'' he said. ``But there it is: inflation is stalled out.''
   Meanwhile Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the
non-farm economy grew at an annual rate of only 3 percent in the
third quarter compared with what was generally acknowledged as an
overheated rate of 3.9 percent last spring.
   The effects of the drought, however, limited overall GNP growth
to 2.5 percent, in line with the Federal Reserve Board's
non-inflationary growth target of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
   Preliminary reports had put the annual non-farm growth rate at
3.2 percent and total GNP growth at 2.6 percent in the third
quarter. Economists said the downward revisions were due primarily
to larger declines in government spending and the drought having
less overall impact than previously believed.
   Corporate profits before taxes rose 2.6 percent in the
July-September quarter to $313.9 billion, following 6.9 percent jump
in the second quarter. After taxes, corporations reported their
profits rising 3.9 percent in the third quarter compared with 8.9
percent last spring.
   ``With productivity growth slowing, the big profit increases in
the economy are over,'' said Larry Chimerine, president of the WEFA
Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``Higher unit labor
costs are squeezing profit margins.''
   But those higher labor costs are not finding their way into
workers' wallets. Average weekly earnings of $327.92 last month,
after adjusting for November's inflation, dropped 0.8 percent, the
Labor Department said Tuesday.
   In terms of buying power, workers are making 1 percent less than
they did a year ago, the department said.
   The November increases raised the Consumer Price Index to 120.3,
meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing $100 in a 1982-84 base
period would have cost $120.30 last month, a dime more than in
October and $4.40 more than in November 1987.
   Housing and shelter costs, including residential rents, rose 0.3
percent in November, the same pace they have maintained over the
past nine months.
   Natural gas and electric rates were up 1.8 percent and 0.1
percent, respectively, from October, more than offsetting a 2
percent drop in prices for home heating oil, the government said.
The November decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil, now
priced 10.8 percent below where it was last spring.
   Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from October,
remaining 0.2 percent less than they were at the end of last year
and 28.1 percent below their peak level of March 1981.
   Consumer prices for items other than food, shelter and energy
rose an average 0.2 percent in November after jumping 0.7 percent in
October.
   New-car prices, which has risen more than one percentage point in
Spetember and October, declined by 0.2 percent last month in reflect
the introduction of rebates on some of the new 1989 models.
   However, auto financing and insurance costs continued to advance
dramatically, with the former up 1.5 percent and the latter 0.9
percent above October. Airline fares also jumped by 1.1 percent.
   Medical costs, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent last month and are up
at an annual rate of 7 percent so far this year.

   Here are Tuesday's economic reports from the

<HEAD>Inflation:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Inflation slowed in November to an annual rate of 3 percent as
clothing prices fell and food stabilized. The Consumer Price Index,
after seasonal adjustment, rose 0.25 percent. That followed a 0.4
percent gain in October.
   The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 percent
for the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the first 11
months.
   Another month similar to November could enable the Reagan
administration to leave office on target for inflation of 4.3
percent for 1988.

<HEAD>Gross National Product:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The summer's drought held the gross national product to a
moderate 2.5 percent annual growth in the July-September quarter.
Growth in the GNP, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed
from 3.0 percent in the second quarter and 3.4 percent in the first
quarter.
   The drought knocked $12.3 billion off the GNP, which was $4.01
trillion on an annual basis, adjusted for inflation and season.
Excluding the drought, the GNP grew 3.9 percent in the second
quarter and 3.0 percent in the third.

<HEAD>Corporate Profits:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   U.S. corporations reported that third-quarter profits rose $6.4
billion or 3.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual $169.1
billion. That was down from a robust 8.9 percent increase in the
second quarter.
   Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.5 percent to $105.7
billion in the third quarter, compared with a 1.8 percent gain in
the second quarter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Weekly Earnings:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for
inflation, plunged 0.8 percent in November after jumping 0.7 percent
in October.
   The November decline stemmed from a 0.6 percent drop in the
number of hours worked and a 0.1 percent decline in average earnings
per hour, the first drop since February. Together, the drops more
than offset a 0.2 percent increase in prices as measured by a
special index for urban wage earners.
   Average weekly earnings in November, before adjusting for
inflation, were $327.92, only 3.2 percent higher than a year ago.
Taking the 4.1 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account
over the 12 months, real weekly earnings are 1 percent lower than a
year ago.
