<HEAD>Officials Ready Pizza Van For Trip To Soviet Union</HEAD>

   A specially equipped van that can churn
out more than 7,000 slices of pizza a day for hungry Muscovites was
unveiled in preparation for its shipment to the Soviet Union.
   The mobile pizzeria, conceived by two New Jersey entrepreneurs,
will be put aboard an container ship early next week for the
two-week trip to Helsinki, Finland, Astro Pizza Ltd. Inc. officials
said Friday in this New York Harbor city.
   Company operations manager Patrick Ferrante said he would drive
the van 750 miles to Moscow, and that Muscovites should be munching
on American-style pizza within a month.
   ``They're going to love it. Who doesn't love pizza?'' said Louis
Piancone Sr., president of Roma Food Enterprises Inc. in
Piscataway, which is participating in the joint venture.
   Pizza will be made every seven minutes and will cost about 70
cents a slice, Piancone said. A 16-inch cheese pie will go for
$5.50, or seven rubles.
   The 36-foot-by-11-foot van has an oven, refrigerators, freezers
and a machine that presses dough in three seconds. It several
hundred thousand dollars to design and build, officials said.
   All the pizza ingredients will come from the United States, said
Piancone.
   Piancone and partner Shelley M. Ziegler, who operates a Trenton
real estate and import firm, said they intend to follow the mobile
pizzeria with up to 25 stores to serve pizzas and Italian dishes to
Moscow residents and tourists.
   Pizza is served in the Soviet Union but ``the concept is totally
different from in America and that's unfortunate,'' Piancone said.
   Piancone and Ziegler set up Astro Pizza after signing an
agreement with Moscow officials who visited New Jersey last October.
   Officials credited Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness, with permitting their business to move ahead.
   Piancone, who plans a later trip to the Soviet Union, said he
hopes to serve pizza to Gorbachev.
   To teach Soviet employees the secret of making delicious pizza,
several technicians from Roma, which supplies pizza makers in 33
U.S. states with everything from pans to sauce, will accompany
Piancone.
   If the Soviet venture succeeds, Astro Pizza outlets in Spain,
Japan, China and Italy may not be far behind, he said.

   The woman who resigned as head of Gallaudet
University after angry student protests says officials didn't
foresee that having a deaf president would become ``a national
civil rights matter.''
   Elisabeth Ann Zinser, who can hear and does not know sign
language, said a week of outcry over her appointment at the school
for the deaf made her see that deaf people as a group must ``take
their place in society and this had become the time.''
   ``I have responded to this extraordinary social movement of deaf
people, not to the demands of the students and protesters,'' she
said.
   ``As the search progressed and as we got to the point of
actually making the offer to me, the situation was becoming more
intense, but they still did not perceive that it would end up
becoming a national civil rights matter,'' she said.
   She said she resigned when she realized how deeply the deaf
community felt about the Gallaudet presidency as a symbol.
   ``I eventually began to really believe what was being said here
on the part of that community,'' she said.
   The 124-year-old school is the only liberal arts university for
the deaf in the world, but has never had a deaf president.
   About 2,500 students and supporters rallied at the Capitol after
Zinser resigned, claiming victory, but insisting that they would
not stop until their demand for a deaf president is met.
   The students say they want the president chosen from the two
deaf finalists from Sunday.
   The students want Jane Bassett Spilman, chairwoman of the board
to resign, a deaf majority on the board, and guarantees that there
would be no reprisals against any of the demonstrators.
   Virtually all 2,200 graduate and undergraduate students at
Gallaudet participated in the week-long protests.
   ``We're still winning. We're still winning,'' said student
leader Jerry Covell. He said he was pleased that Zinser had
resigned, but he urged the students to continue their battle.
   Gary Olsen, executive director of the National Association of
the Deaf, told the students their protests had helped the cause of
deaf people nationwide.
   Truman Stelle, a Gallaudet faculty member, said, ``It is long
past time that Gallaudet had a deaf president, as testimony that
deaf people are capable of leading themselves.''
   Stelle said the ouster of Spilman was important because ``she
clearly sees herself as owner of the Gallaudet plantation,
answerable to no one.''
   At a news conference earlier Friday, Spilman criticized the
``external interests of people who perhaps are not as interested or
involved in the day-to-day operations of Gallaudet and not as well
informed as the board and the administration.'' She did not
elaborate.
   Zinser, who was vice chancellor of the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro, had never formally submitted her
resignation there, and University of North Carolina system
President C.D. Spangler said she would be welcome back.
   The House Education and Labor Committee's subcommittee on select
education, which has jurisdiction over funding for Gallaudet, has
scheduled hearings for Tuesday to review the makeup of the board
and the controversy over the presidential selection. Three-quarters
of the school's $76 million operating budget comes from the federal
government.
   And John Banzhaff, George Washington University law professor
and founder of the National Center for Law and the Deaf, has filed
a complaint with the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights
charging the board with unlawful discrimination for never hiring a
deaf president.

   Two car bombs exploded in the
fashionable ``pink zone'' strip of restaurants and night clubs
Friday, injuring one boy and scattering dinner customers, witnesses
said.
   The explosions occurred about 9:30 p.m., several hours after
about 400 union activists marched through the capital to demand
that the Salvadoran government free a detained labor leader.
   The car bombs damaged five private cars and shattered windows in
three businesses, the witnesses said.
   The boy had minor head and arm injuries but did not appear to be
seriously hurt.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the explosions.
   Leftist guerrillas assumed responsibility for a machine-gun
attack in the same district June 19, 1985, in which 13 people,
including four off-duty U.S. Embassy Marine guards and two American
businessmen, were killed.
   In the march earlier Friday, one demonstrator was wounded by a
gunshot in the leg when other demonstrators identified an
undercover security agent in their ranks and confronted him. The
man pulled a pistol, shot a demonstrator and ran off.
   There were no confrontations with police or soldiers along the
five-mile march route. Uniformed security forces were not in sight.
   The demonstrators, many of whom carried nail-studded wooden
clubs and iron bars, asked passengers to get off about 10 buses
along the march route, then deflated the bus tires so the vehicles
blocked side streets.
   A pickup truck was set afire near the U.S. Embassy, where the
marchers stopped for 30 minutes to denounce U.S. support for the
Salvadoran government.
   Protesters painted the walls around the embassy with
anti-American slogans, and set a stack of tires afire.
   The demonstrators demanded the release of Humberto Centeno, the
leader of the telecommunications workers union, who was arrested
Thursday night.
   The union members alleged Centeno was badly beaten by the troops
who arrested him, and that he was hospitalized.
   The government acknowledged Centeno's arrest but claimed he
tried to attack a member of the security forces. It made no mention
of his condition.
   Centeno was arrested after about 50 union members occupied the
Labor Ministry for nine hours Thursday, demanding higher pay and
reinstatement of fired workers.
   Several metal boxes containing telephone line connections were
pried open during Friday's march, doused with gasoline, and set
ablaze, leaving dozens of city blocks without phone service.

   Take trend-setting Princess Diana, mix in a
fashion collection that's cheeky and classic, long and short, and
British designers hope to have the perfect ingredients for a
smashing autumn season.
   Conscious of the lingering effects of the October stock market
crash and Britain's soaring pound, London's top designers have
abandoned the silly and unsaleable for a massive dose of realism _
what Alastair Blair calls ``just adult grown-up clothes.''
   There is still plenty of individuality and a little zaniness _
Vivian Westwood's mini-crinoline skirt topped with a peplum and
under-bust waistcoat _ but overall the fall collections launched
Friday were eminently wearable.
   The four-day London show attracting more than 6,000 buyers has
become a regular stop on the international fashion circuit,
sandwiched between the Milan and Paris shows. The clothing and
textile industry is Britain's third-largest export earner, with
clothing exports alone totaling $2.4 billion.
   Princess Diana, one of the industry's biggest boosters, hopes to
give Britain's designers an edge over foreign rivals with a
reception Monday night at her home in Kensington Palace for 200
buyers, designers and fashion journalists.
   Edina Ronay, a favorite designer of the princess and her
sister-in-law, the Duchess of York, said: ``It's one-up on any
other country that doesn't have a royal family that the whole world
knows about.''
   Blair, another royal favorite, said of the princess: ``I think
she's 98 percent responsible for the revival of interest in British
fashion and I think what she's doing is terrific.''
   Like the Italians, Britain's designers couldn't decide whether
hems should be long or short so they offered both with plenty of
trousers, mainly wide, as well as some slimmer jodhpurs, breeches
and Dickensian stovepipes.
   Several British designers also picked up on the Italian
fascination with ``ecological furs.'' Arabella Pollen, who did a
circus theme, had fake leopard and zebra mini-suits and Antony
Price did brocade suits and frock coats trimmed in fake mink.
   Ronay's designs went Edwardian. Wendy Dagworthy also explored
``retro themes of Edwardian and late Forties'' and Betty Jackson
did hourglass Edwardian jackets in a collection she called ``a
complete mix-up ... which I love.''
   The new realism of British fashion, the designers said, means
choice, quality and price-consciousness.
   ``I think it's luxury dressing ... it's beautiful fabrics, it's
opulent,'' said David Sassoon of Belville Sassoon.
   ``And then there's a contradiction, well almost, with lots of
trousers _ they're suddenly important again and they don't pose a
length problem. Women who don't know whether to go long or short
will opt for pants,'' he said.
   Betty Jackson's collection was nearly all pants, wide and slim.
Rifat Ozbek designed a clinging wool jersey jumpsuit with a tiny
draped mini-skirt over it. Bruce Oldfield said shapes were more
important than lengths _ and he's doing bell skirts.
   Benny Ong, who showed silks with short bell skirts as well as
long tubular dresses, said: ``I think women want to look younger
but without looking silly. Give them a choice, but maintain their
integrity.''
   Blair echoed that view, showing long and short skirts. ``I think
women who do spend money on clothes are fed up that they have to
look like 18-year-olds. You have to give people a choice.'' he said.
   With flounces and full skirts outmoded, Blair said he was able
to use less fabric and cut the cost of his daywear by 25 percent
and his evening gowns by 17 percent _ a plus in the current
financial climate.
   Gina Fratini, whose black velvet cocktail dresses with ruffles
and dashes of hot pink, electric blue and turquoise were an instant
seller, said the stock market crash had made the designers ``come
out fighting.''
   ``I think the stock market crash, if anything, has brought the
fun clothes back because we want to cheer ourselves up,'' she said.

   A 30-year-old man slit his throat with a
razor blade outside a judge's chambers shortly after being
convicted of sexually abusing a 7-year-old girl and repeatedly
burning her with a cigarette, authorities said.
   Albert John Lang of New Derry was in serious condition today at
Westmoreland Hospital in this western Pennsylvania city, said a
nursing supervisor who refused to give her name.
   The incident occurred Friday after Westmoreland County Judge
Daniel Ackerman excused the jury that convicted Lang, said District
Attorney John Driscoll.
   Lang was handing his personal belongings to his wife when he
suddenly charged toward Ackerman's door, Driscoll said. Deputy
sheriffs quickly locked the door.
   ``Lang then sliced his throat with a razor blade and was subdued
by the deputy sheriffs,'' Driscoll said.
   Lang was convicted of several counts of molestation and a charge
of wounding the girl 90 times with a cigarette, according to
Driscoll.

<HEAD>Department Funds Will Help Promote Salmon Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department export program is
helping Alaska promote salmon in Western Europe and Japan, two
lucrative U.S. farm markets where competition is rising.
   The department's Targeted Export Assistance program, popularly
called TEA, has allocated $1.95 million this fiscal year for the
Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, a quasi-independent commission
of the state's Department of Commerce and Economic Development.
   According to a USDA list of trade organizations sharing in the
program, the only other comparable group is the Catfish Farmers of
America, which was allocated $50,000.
   Department officials said each TEA plan is negotiated with the
sponsoring group. Some put up money to match or exceed the federal
contribution, while others contribute less than TEA provides.
   Total funding of TEA, which was authorized by the Food Security
Act of 1985, was pegged at a minimum of $110 million annually.
About 40 different commodities, including Alaskan seafood, share in
the program.
   As directed by Congress, the purpose of TEA is to finance
promotional activities for U.S. agricultural products that have
been put to a disadvantage by subsidies and unfair trade policies
of competitor nations.
   The institute is ready to pit Alaska salmon against pen-raised
salmon from Norway being promoted in France and Japan, according to
Roberta Graham of Evans-Kraft Bean, an Anchorage public relations
firm representing the institute.
   Alaska processors also are attending trade fairs and food shows
in Tokyo and Paris to promote salmon, Ms. Graham said this week
(Thursday) during a visit to Washington.
   ``You have the Corn Belt and the Wheat Belt,'' she said. ``I
choose to call Alaska the Fish Belt.''
   The importance of fishing to the Alaskan economy cannot be
understated, she said. It's second only to the oil, generating $900
million for the state's economy last year.
   In the first year of the TEA program, the Alaskans got $1.5
million from USDA. The 1988 allocation, according to March 1
figures by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service, is $1.95
million, making a two-year total of $3.45 million.
   But no matter how important fishing is to Alaska, the state's
TEA allocation is a small part of the program's overall budget for
the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Some other commodities
qualified for much higher shares.
   The largest single TEA allocation this year is $10.5 million to
promote citrus from Arizona and California. The American Soybean
Association followed with $9.8 million. The U.S. Feed Grains
Council got $2.4 million, and U.S. Wheat Associates, $1.2 million.
   California, the nation's leading producer of agricultural
products in terms of value, qualifies for the largest share of TEA
money. The 1988 allocations, for example, include six different
California state commissions and boards affecting: avocados,
$450,000; cling peaches, $5.7 million; kiwifruit, $500,000; prunes,
$5.5 million; raisins, $9.8 million; and table grapes, $750,000.
   As the main producer of almonds, California also benefits from
$6.5 million of TEA money allocated for that crop this year. The
Walnut Marketing Board gets $6.5 million to promote walnuts
overseas, another California crop.

   The keynote speaker for the Agriculture
Department's conference on quality of farm products will be U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   The meeting will be held in St. Louis, Mo., June 29 through July
1, said Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles.
   Gilles said Friday that the conference ``will focus on
maintaining a quality advantage for American agriculture in the
highly competitive domestic and international marketplace.''
   Subject matter will include cereals, oilseeds, fruits and nuts,
vegetables, red meat, poultry, industrial crops, dairy, tobacco,
cotton, wool, horticulture and forage crops.
   ``The major audience for this conference is farm organizations,
farm market development organizations, agribusiness, wholesalers,
retailers, trade associations, agriculturally related industries,
and the agricultural higher-education community,'' he said.

   The Agriculture Department is adding the
Simbrah Association to its list of registered cattle breeds so
owners can qualify for higher federal payments when animals are
slaughtered under the department's brucellosis eradication program.
   Brucellosis is a highly contagious disease, said James W.
Glosser, acting administrator of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
   ``Our experience has shown that indemnities encourage owners to
remove infected animals from their herds to prevent the spread of
the disease.''
   Brucellosis can be passed on to humans _ where it is known as
undulant fever _ through raw milk from infected cows.
   Simbrah cattle are a cross between Simmental and Brahman, the
department said. Approximately 2,200 U.S. producers own registered
Simbrah cattle.
   To receive federal indemnities for registered cattle, the owner
must present a certificate of registration as proof that the animal
belonged to one of the 61 USDA-listed breed associations.
   The indemnity rate for all dairy cattle, and registered beef
cattle and bison is $250 per animal, while the payment for
non-registered beef and bison is $50 per animal.
   Officials said the new rule goes into effect on April 11.

<HEAD>Local Environmental Groups Unify To Fight Interior's Offshore
Leasing Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local environmental groups from New England to
Florida to the Pacific Northwest are joining forces against the
Reagan administration's five-year plan for offshore oil and gas
leasing.
   ``No longer will the fight to block the administration's leasing
plan be a series of pitched battles,'' Lynn Davidson of Greenpeace
said Friday.
   Coalition organizers said at a news conference following three
days of meetings in Washington that they will consider joint public
education campaigns, lobbying efforts and perhaps an advertising
campaign.
   ``This is not a state, local or regional issue, it is a national
issue,'' said Rachael Binah of the Ocean Sanctuary Coordinating
Committee. ``We want Americans to see the bigger picture.
   ``If the Department of Interior is allowed to continue with its
five-year leasing plan, the coastline of the United States will be
systematically destroyed,' she said.
   Environmental leaders said they will focus on federal
legislation for sensitive coastal areas in New England, Florida and
California that would block or defer implementation of the
five-year leasing plan, which was unveiled last year by Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel.
   The most sensitive parts of Georges Bank, a fishing-rich area
off the New England coast, already are protected under a
congressional moratorium. Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., vowed last
week to fight for the Georges Bank ban again this year.
   Ann Whitfield of the Florida Public Interest Research Group said
Hodel, because of the five-year plan, makes former Interior
Secretary James Watt ``look like an environmentalist.'' Watt and
his policies were constantly under attack by the environmental
community during his tenure early in the Reagan administration.
   Richard Charter, who represents some cities and counties in the
offshore leasing controversy in California, said the coalition also
wants to force the leasing issue into the presidential campaign.
   ``We're here to send a message that America cares about its
coastline,'' he said.
   He said all the Democratic presidential aspirants have vowed to
either oppose or modify Hodel's plan, which outlines the areas open
for leasing and creates a timetable for the leasing of tracts.
   The Republican candidates have not answered issue inquiries sent
by the activists, Charter said.
   Regional activists said they are fighting proposals to lease
tracts off the coasts of California, Florida, New England, the Gulf
and the Pacific Northwest.
   A group of environmentalists in August sued the Interior
Department to halt the Interior Department's leasing plan. That
suit is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals.

<HEAD>CBO Says Lowering Capital Gains Rate Wouldn't Produce Revenue</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional analysts are challenging
President Reagan's contention that a capital-gains tax cut would
reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Although boosting the tax rate probably would produce less
revenue, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that most
evidence indicates that a lower rate would also result in a revenue
loss. The study estimated that loss at $3.9 billion to $7.8 billion
a year if the top rate on long-term capital gains were lowered from
33 percent to 15 percent.
   Some advocates estimate the government would collect as much as
$15 billion a year more under a 15 percent cut because the lower
rate would encourage people to sell long-held assets.
   CBO researchers cautioned against putting too much faith in any
prediction of how taxpayers might react to changes. There are so
many uncertainties, the study said, ``that one cannot reject the
possibility that a 15 percent rate might increase revenues.'' But
the CBO said that is unlikely.
   As part of the massive revision of federal income taxes in 1986,
Congress eliminated the long-time preferential treatment accorded
capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, real
estate and other assets owned more than six months. That action
raised the top rate on capital gains from 20 percent to 33 percent.
   In a written message to Congress on Jan. 25, Reagan said: ``The
most important piece of unfinished (tax) business is to reduce the
capital-gains tax rate to the level that will generate the savings
and investment necessary for future economic growth. Past
experience demonstrates that lowering the capital-gains tax rate
will mean increased realizations of capital gains upon which taxes
are paid.
   ``Reducing the capital-gains tax rate to an agreed-upon optimum
should be a cornerstone of tax reform for the 1990s,'' Reagan wrote.
   The president did not say how deeply the rate should be cut, but
the level mentioned most often by congressional advocates is 15
percent.
   There is considerable support in Congress for reducing the
maximum capital-gains rate. Advocates say this not only would raise
revenue _ by encouraging the sale of long-held assets _ but also
would encourage new investment.
   Opponents, noting that eliminating the capital-gains benefit was
a major factor in getting the 1986 tax law enacted, contend
restoring it would threaten that entire package.
   Most benefits of a capital-gains reduction would go to the
wealthiest Americans. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that
taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or more account for 55 percent
of all capital gains but only 9 percent of other income.
   In a report to Chairman William Gray, D-Pa., of the House Budget
Committee, the CBO concluded that any increase in capital-gains
realizations _ the sale of assets _ was not likely to generate
enough revenue to offset a cut in the tax rate.
   In addition, the study said, restoring preferential treatment to
capital gains might reduce other forms of taxable income, such as
interest and dividends, because investments that created capital
gains would be made more attractive than other types.

<TEXT>
   Teamsters President Jackie Presser's attorney
says he's pleased with a ruling that prosecutors improperly
obtained statements from an FBI agent charged with lying about his
role in handling Presser as an informant.
   ``We look forward to a similar result in the Jackie Presser
case,'' attorney John Climaco said in an interview in Cleveland
Friday after an appeals court in Washington suppressed statements
that former Cleveland FBI agent Robert S. Friedrick allegedly made
to government prosecutors in early 1986.
   Friedrick was indicted in May 1986 on five counts of making
false statements that forced the government to delay for nearly a
year its planned prosecution of Presser.
   Presser, who has headed the 1.6 million-member Teamsters union
since 1983, was also indicted in May 1986. A grand jury in
Cleveland charged him with two counts of labor racketeering, one
count of embezzlement and two counts of filing false reports with
the government. His trial is set for July.
   Friedrick orginally said Presser had been authorized by his FBI
handlers to hire ``ghost employees'' at a Cleveland Teamsters union
local who did no work.
   The Justice Department wanted to prosecute Presser for the
alleged ghost hirings, but abandoned the investigation after
Friedrick's assertions.
   However, Friedrick admitted during the ensuing FBI-Justice
Department inquiry that his statements about authorizing the
illegal acts were false, according to tapes and transcripts
provided by the Justice Department. His alleged admissions revived
the Teamsters probe, which resulted in the indictment of Presser.
   Friedrick's attorney, William Beyer, said Friday's appeals court
decision eliminates the only evidence prosecutors have against his
client.
   ``I don't know of any other evidence that they have to support
their claim,'' Beyer said in a telephone interview from Cleveland.
   But Friedrick, who was fired from the FBI last August, succeeded
in having his alleged admissions suppressed as evidence by U.S.
District Judge George Revercomb on grounds that the Justice
Department interrogators had not advised him of his constitutional
right to remain silent.
   Clendon Lee, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Washington, declined comment.
   It was unclear what effect the decision would have on the
government's case against Presser.
   Stephen Jigger, head of the FBI strike force in Cleveland and
prosecutor in the Presser case, declined comment, saying he had not
yet received a copy of the court decision.
   During a June 26, 1985, interview at FBI headquarters in
Washington, Friedrick signed an FBI form that said he was required
to answer questions, but that the government could not use his
statements against him in a criminal prosecution as long as they
were true.
   During interviews the following January, Friedrick made
statements contradicting his previous assertion that Presser had
been authorized to put ghost employees on the local's payroll. The
next day he failed a lie detector test.
   The appellate court upheld Revercomb's finding that Friedrick
was not warned during the interview that statements he made could
be used against him.
   The prosecutors ``made a conscious decision prior to the
interview not to furnish Friedrick with or even mention (the FBI
form); indeed they hoped that Friedrick would make incriminating
statements that they could use against him in a subsequent
prosecution,'' the court said in an opinion by Judge Kenneth Starr.

   A sore jaw from a bout in the dentist's
chair has put Gov. Mario Cuomo out of action for a couple of days
and will probably cause him to skip a Gridiron-style dinner, his
press secretary says.
   The governor's dental work Friday was nothing serious but was
enough for him to be told to ``lay low'' through today, said Gary
Fryer.
   As a result, Cuomo will probably skip an appearance tonight at
the annual Inner Circle dinner, a satirical look at New York City
politics and government staged by reporters, Fryer said.
   Fryer said he wasn't certain of the exact nature of the dental
work, but said Cuomo might have to return for more.

   Baseball player Steve Kiefer says he's lucky
to be alive after getting smacked with a beer bottle that cut his
neck.
   Kiefer, an infielder with the Milwaukee Brewers, suffered cuts
that required nearly 200 stitches after the incident Thursday night
at a night spot here.
   ``The doctor told me it was one-sixteenth of an inch from the
carotid artery,'' said Kiefer, 27. ``If it would have cut that, it
would have killed me. I feel lucky to be alive.''
   Delfino Neira, 28, of Bakersfield, Calif., was charged Friday
with aggravated assault. Police said there was an argument over a
woman's belt before Neira left the bar, and he returned later and
hit Kiefer with the bottle.
   Kiefer said he found a belt on the floor of the nightclub and
gave it to a woman who said it was hers.
   Shortly after that, Kiefer said, Neira ``came by and nudged me.
I didn't accost him. I just said `Excuse me.' '' Neira apparently
left the bar but returned about 45 minutes later.
   ``I don't recall any argument,'' Kiefer said. ``The police said
he was a friend of the girl who the belt belonged to. But I don't
see what that had to do with it, because I gave it back to her.''
   Kiefer was expected to return to team workouts Sunday.

   Lotfi Mansouri has quit as general director of

   The Iranian-born Mansouri, who has had the Toronto post for 12
years, said he leaves the city with ``great sadness,'' but added,
``I am sick and tired of trying to justify the art form (here).''
   At a news conference Friday, he again expressed regret that the
Canadian company is not better supported by government funds and
that there still is no definite word on a proposed new opera-ballet
house in Toronto.
   He will take up his new post in January 1989, succeeding general
director Terence McEwen, who is retiring for health reasons. Both
men are 58.
   The San Francisco Opera, second in size on the continent to New
York's Metropolitan Opera, has a budget of $25 million, twice that

   President Reagan says he is prepared to take
additional steps against Panama's government if a new series of
economic sanctions does not force military strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega from power.
   As expected, Reagan announced Friday that the United States will
withhold a $6.5 million payment due to Panama next Tuesday for
operations relating to the Panama Canal. He took other measures
designed to make Panmanian products less competitive in U.S.
markets.
   ``Until such time as a democratic government is restored in
Panama, the U.S. cannot proceed on a business as usual basis,''
Reagan said in a statement.
   Panama's Ambassador, Juan B. Sosa, praised Reagan's
announcement. He told a news conference late Friday that the
sanctions, combined with anti-government actions by the Panamanian
people, will be enough to bring Noriega down.
   Sosa has refused to recognize the two-week old regime in Panama,
sharing Reagan's view that it took power by unconstitutional means
and is therefore illegitimate. Sosa has declined to turn over the
embassy to a new envoy named by Noriega.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, the ranking minority member of a
House subcommittee that deals with the Panama Canal, said he was
``ecstatic'' over Reagan's announcement. He predicted the sanctions
will hasten Noriega's departure.
   Reagan said that Noriega, under federal indictment on drug
trafficking charges, would best serve Panama by relinquishing his
post as commander of Panama's Defense Forces.
   Reagan's announcement came two weeks after President Eric Arturo
Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega but was instead ousted hours
later in a move that had all the the earmarks of a military coup.
   The president said his decision to withhold the $6.5 million
payment and place it in escrow was not in violation of U.S.
obligations under the Panama Canal treaties.
   ``I am prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to deny
the transfer of funds to the Noriega regime from other sources in
the U.S.,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan also said that Panamanian exports subject to U.S. tariffs
will no longer be admitted at the lowest possible rates. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz said the amount of annual trade affected
by the decision is $96 million.
   In addition, Reagan announced the suspension of Panamanian
participation in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, under which some
products are allowed duty-free entry into the United States.
   He also ordered stepped-up inspection of people and goods
entering the United States from Panama in order to apprehend drug
traffickers and money launderers.
   Shultz said there was no need to impose an additional sanction
relating to the fees Panama receives from Alaskan oil shipments
transferred to U.S. East Coast ports through a Panamanian pipeline.
   Shultz said those fees already have been frozen based on earlier
court action. Estimates of the revenues Panama receives from the
pipeline range from $80 million to $120 million annually.
   The aim of the sanctions is to aggravate an existing cash-flow
crisis in Panama. Panamanian newspapers said Friday paychecks for
government workers may have to be delayed because of the cash
shortage.
   Also on Friday, ABC News quoted diplomatic sources as saying the
government of Spain was prepared to offer asylum to Noriega.
   The two countries most mentioned by opposition leaders as
possible asylum sites are Paraguay and the Dominican Republic.
Opposition leaders say they have sounded out the Dominican Republic
and that Noriega sent two military colleagues to Paraguay this past
week, possibly to discuss asylum prospects.

   Firefighters begged for help from
neighboring counties Friday in battling grass fires that seared a
60-mile swath across West Texas ranch land.
   ``The fire is out of control on all fronts,'' the Shackelford
County sheriff's office reported. ``We're pulling all our forces
back in to protect homes.''
   The fire killed an undetermined number of cattle, set hunting
camps ablaze, and destroyed at least one mobile home. Some of the
500 firefighters suffered minor burns and were overcome by smoke,
but no serious injuries were reported.
   The fire was reported within two or three miles of Albany, a
town of about 2,500 people, but evacuations were not immediately
ordered. Firefighters earlier burned ground near the town to divert
the main fire.
   ``It's just an inferno in the pastures. And with winds of 35
mph, a horse couldn't outrun it,'' said Albany resident Liston F.
Todd, who was helping build firebreaks to detour the blaze.
   The fire, which began Thursday, covered an area 60 miles long
and 25 miles wide over three counties, with at least a 20-mile wide
portion of the blaze out of control, officials said.
   Joe Fox, the Texas Forest Service official overseeing the
firefighting, said it could take four more days to finally put out
the fire. Smoke and haze reached the Fort Worth-Dallas area, more
than 120 miles east of the blaze.
   A U.S. Forest Service aircraft tanker was scheduled to fly over
the area Saturday morning, dumping up to 2,000 gallons of
fire-extinguishing chemicals.
   Shifting winds made it difficult to determine where the fire
would spread, and in some cases firefighters were nearly surrounded
by the swift flames.
   At least one firefighting bulldozer was caught and destroyed by
the fire. A TV news team was momentarily threatened by a line of
fire that suddenly changed course.
   Twenty volunteer fire departments sent men and equipment to the
area on Friday, a day after Gov. Bill Clements ordered 100 National
Guardsmen to help.
   They joined nearly two dozen Forest Service firefighters and the
crews of 15 fire deparments. Police radios crackled with pleas for
more equipment and manpower to battle the blazes.
   Texas Forest Service spokesman Sam Logan said there had been
speculation that trash fires may have sparked the blazes when
humidity dipped to 7 percent Thursday. ``We consider anything below
30 percent is really dangerous.''
   Meanwhile, a blaze broke out in Val Verde County about 200 miles
away, blackening 125,000 acres of ranchland about 60 miles north of
the Mexican border.
   No injuries were reported. A shift in the wind was expected to
help the fire burn itself out, officials.

   Jesse Jackson was hoping to win a clear
majority of delegates today in South Carolina's Democratic
presidential caucuses, while Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
insisted he was a strong contender.
   ``If you believe it we're going to win this nomination,''
Jackson told members of the South Carolina Education Association
Friday.
   Jackson said half the states have held primaries or caucuses and
he has finished first or second in all but a few of them. ``In
South Carolina ... I want to win another gold medal.''
   The caucus meetings at 1,788 precincts were scheduled to begin
in the late afternoon.
   Jackson came into South Carolina second to Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis in delegates overall, and Jackson predicted that
after today's caucuses and the primary Tuesday in his second home,
Illinois, he would be the delegate leader.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon has virtually ignored South Carolina
recently and his state campaign coordinator, Dan King, said Friday
that the campaign was asking Simon supporters to remain uncommitted
in the caucuses today but to work to become delegates to the county
conventions later in the month.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt campaigned two days in the state
this week and also is looking for a share of the 44 delegates at
stake.
   Gore, who toured the state's major cities Friday, said he
expected to do ``extremely well'' today and said he was the
candidate with the momentum. He told a crowd of a few hundred
supporters at the Statehouse that his strong showing on Super
Tuesday surprised everyone.
   ``I believe that momentum is going to continue right through the
convention in Atlanta and right through November,'' he said. ``I'm
excited about the possibility of victory.''
   John Dukakis said Friday he believed his father would get some
support because of his front-runner status and his vision for
economic growth.
   ``We would like to pick up some delegates,'' he said. ``But
we're realistic and know it's going to be difficult. We understand
that we're up against two strong favorite sons and that they are
going to do well.''

<TEXT>
   A construction company facing lawsuits
and fines over a building collapse in Bridgeport, Conn., that
killed 28 workmen filed Friday for reorganization under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Texstar Construction Corp. and its subsidiary Continental Lift
Slab Corp. took the step so that any litigation can be heard in
Texas rather than the unfriendly judicial environment of
Bridgeport, said corporate counsel David T. Turlington.
   It acted after a federal judge in Bridgeport approved a $187
million lien against company assets to cover any damages that might
result from a suit filed over the April 1987 collapse of the
L'Ambiance Plaza apartment complex by victims and families.
   ``You basically have convicted the guy and taken his assets, and
he still hasn't had the right to a trial,'' said Turlington. ``We
are concerned about the political and judicial atmosphere in
Connecticut, which has been attempting to ban the lift-slab
method.''
   San Antonio-based Texstar was the primary subcontractor on the
L'Ambiance Plaza. It was constructed using the lift-slab method, in
which concrete floors are poured on the ground, then lifted by
jacks to their proper height along vertical steel columns.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Texstar
$2.52 million for 238 instances of alleged willful violations.
Texstar also has been referred to the Justice Department for
possible prosecution.
   On March 2, victims and families of victims filed suit in U.S.
District Court in Bridgeport against Texstar. Judge Warren Eginton
on March 2 gave the plaintiffs permission to attach $187 million of
Texstar's assets.
   Texstar listed unsecured debts of almost $190 million and assets
of about $1.3 million. Continental Lift Slab listed unsecured debts
of $150,449 and assets of $327,709.
   Chapter 11 allows a company to hold off its creditors while it
undergoes a financial reorganization.
   In a statement, Texstar said Friday that it has not been given
the opportunity ``to a fair and impartial trial or hearing'' and
that bankruptcy court would provide a forum to answer the
allegations.
   ``We are certainly not going to stop the presses just because
Texstar has filed Chapter 11,'' said Bridgeport attorney Richard
Beider, lead counsel for the victims' families.
   Bieder called the action ``unfortunate because it is another
blow to the families of the victims that comes on the heels of the
tragedy itself and on the heels of laws that are like hurdles that
the families have to overcome to receive just compensation.''

   Associations representing city and county
governments are ``virtually certain'' to appeal a court ruling that
is permitting the Reagan administration to withhold $180 million in
revenue sharing funds, an attorney says.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit on Friday reversed a lower court
ruling and said the administration did not have to distribute the
money to local governments.
   ``I think it's virtually certain we'll ask the court to
reconsider its decision,'' said David C. Vladek, a lawyer for the
National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities,
the U.S. Conference of Mayors and 10 city and county governments.
   ``My sense is the court did not fully comprehend the nature of
our legal arguments,'' he said.
   The dispute involves President Reagan's Feb. 1, 1986, order
under the Gramm-Rudman law that set aside 4.3 percent of budget
items, including $180 million from that year's $4.2 billion
appropriation to the revenue sharing trust fund.
   The local governments argued that the law provided that 1986
budget money that had been sequestered should remain in government
trust funds and be paid out in 1987. They argued that even though
Congress had abolished revenue sharing after 1986, it intended that
any money remaining in the trust fund be distributed.
   Revenue sharing, begun under the Nixon administration, provided
nearly all local governments with unrestricted federal grants.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green on July 28 ruled in favor
of the local governments and said Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III had illegally transferred the revenue sharing money from the
trust fund to the general fund.
   However, Judge John R. Gibson, who wrote the appeals panel's
decision reversing Green, said Congress' intent with the
Gramm-Rudman law was clearly to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   ``Merely freezing (the monies in 1986) and resuscitating them
(in 1987) would not result in any meaningful deficit reduction and
could be characterized by critics to be a sham,'' said Gibson, who
was joined by Judges Patricia M. Wald and David Santelle.
   ``The result in this case may be harsh, but we believe it is
consistent with congressional intent,'' wrote Gibson, who was
designated to the case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit in St. Louis.
   Among the plaintiffs are New York City; Kansas City, Mo.;
Milwaukee County, Wis.; and Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes
Cleveland.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors, at the time of the original
district court decision last summer, had estimated that New York
would receive $10 million; Chicago, $2.6 million; Los Angeles, $2.2
million; and Detroit $1.3 million of the money.
   Other estimates were $606,000 for New Orleans; $554,000 for
Indianapolis; $677,000 for Washington D.C.; $440,000 for Denver and
$104,000 for Des Moines, Iowa. Estimates for other cities were not
provided.

   Here is a transcript of Gary Hart's statement
withdrawing Friday from the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   Thank you very much.
   Thank you all very much.
   I want to, first of all, introduce my wife, Lee, our son, John.
   I want also to acknowledge the presence of some very good
friends and great party leaders here today: The governor of the
state of Colorado, Roy Romer. Our good personal friends and more
than worthy successor to me in the United States Senate, Tim and
Wren Wirth. And the chairman of the Colorado state Democratic
Party, and also a very good friend of ours, Buie Seawell.
   We want to thank each and every one of you for being here.
   Few people have had the good fortune that I've had; good fortune
measured in terms of my family and a far-flung network of friends
and supporters around the country, and in the opportunities that I
have been given to serve my country.
   Fewer Americans, still, have had the opportunity to run for
president of the United States, and I've had that chance twice.
   The people are the strength of this country.
   I said I wanted them to decide about my candidacy.
   I got a fair hearing.
   And the people have decided.
   And now I clearly should not go forward.
   My candidacy represented a more complicated and difficult choice
than in 1984.
   A choice beyond the scope of traditional politics, and I fully
understood that.
   I also had a more far-reaching and complex economic, defense,
and foreign policy agenda.
   That was difficult to reduce to slogans and sound bites.
   Nonetheless, I did get a chance, particularly in the debates, to
get my message of fundamental change and reform on the record, and
to draw distinctions between my ideas and those of the other
Democratic candidates.
   For that, I want to thank all those, especially the young people
who came to my speeches.
   And I want to thank members of the press and media who were
fair, balanced and professional.
   Lee and I want to congratulate Mike and Kitty Dukakis, Jesse and
Jackie Jackson, and Al and Tipper Gore, for their very impressive
achievements last Tuesday and before.
   They've all worked extremely hard, and they deserve every bit of
the credit they have received.
   I also want to thank Paul Simon, along with the others, for his
gentlemanliness towards me in the debates, and wish him well in his
home state primary.
   While disagreeing with him strongly on trade and international
economics, I've been extremely impressed with Dick Gephardt's
thoughtfulness and his equanimity under harsh attack.
   Despite his lack of political success, all of us gained great
respect for Bruce Babbitt, as truth-teller and prophet on our
national budget and fiscal policy.
   Win or lose, each of these candidates has grown in stature and
deserves to be considered as genuine national leaders.
   But win or lose, we also face an unhappy reality.
   The Democratic Party has won only one national election since
1964.
   The struggle in our party is not between the left and the right,
it's between the past and the future.
   And those who cling to the past too often mask their lack of
vision and direction with caution and vagueness and platitudes.
   We can only win if we are prepared to govern.
   And we can only be prepared to govern if we challenge the future
with bold, specific new policies to make our economy productive
once again, and to conduct a serious foreign policy in an
increasingly complex world.
   The remaining candidates should forgo the bitter personal
attacks so favored by political insiders, and, instead, show their
concern for the national interest by seriously debating the issues
that are threatening our country.
   Instead of canceling or running from debates, now that there are
fewer candidates, there should be more debates.

<HEAD>DENVER: more debates.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A presidential campaign really is a debate over differences
among the candidates.
   And that's what it ought to be.
   The remaining candidates should put out budget proposals to
reduce Reagan deficits and show how they would pay for their
programs.
   This would demonstrate competence and show honesty on the tax
issue.
   I encourage these candidates to learn the principles and
philosophy of military reform, because that represents the best
defense policy for our country.
   And they should spell out a foreign policy framework that's
specific on issues such as Third World debt and the use of military
force to avoid the continuing pitfalls of ad hoc response of crisis
after crisis.
   We should challenge our young people to help eliminate
illiteracy and poverty and pollution, to give something back to
their country through a voluntary national service.
   So now is the time that the candidates should welcome serious
debates, not about personalities, but about policies for this
country's future.
   The reason I got back in the race was to help stimulate that
debate about the future, to challenge caution and narrow-interest
politics of the past, and to lead the cause of reform.
   And I intend to continue that leadership for reform, because it
is the best hope for our country.
   It's a cause that lives on beyond any campaign.
   I hope those who share that cause will help me continue the
Center for a New Democracy, which we began in 1984.
   Through the center, through speeches, through writing and
symposiums around the country, we can provide a voice for those who
know our policies must be fundamentally restructured to keep the
torch of democracy and idealism and hope alive.
   Most of all, I want to say that no one has ever been more
blessed with family and friends than I have.
   My friends and supporters around the country have given the word
``loyalty'' new meaning.
   They've toiled tirelessly in an uphill fight, understanding the
odds throughout, and having as their only reward the knowledge that
they had done their very best to move our country forward.
   To all of you everywhere, particularly the young people, my very
warmest thanks and deepest gratitude, and I promise that I'll find
some way in years to come to repay your commitment and loyalty to
the cause which we shared.
   Public words, of course, are insufficient to express my feelings
towards Lee and Andrea and John, each of whom has demonstrated in
his or her own way inexhaustible courage and fortitude and
conviction in that same cause.
   They're owed more than I can ever possibly repay.
   And to those of you in and out of politics who may face
setbacks, failures, or defeats, who are told to give up,
accommodate, or compromise, I hope you'll simply say, as I do,
``Hell, no.''
   Preserve your integrity, study time and patience, and never give
up.
   As I have before, I leave with you these words:
   ``No great cause is ever lost or ever won. The battle must
always be renewed and the creed restated, for some things are
universal, catholic, and undying. They do not age or pass out of
fashion, for they symbolize eternal things. They are the guardians
of the freedom of the human spirit, the proof of what our mortal
frailty can achieve.''
   Thank you all.
   God bless you.

   Following is the text of Robert C. McFarlane's
statement to reporters after his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges
of misleading Congress in the Iran-Contra affair.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I should say at the outset that from the beginning, Judge Walsh
and all of his staff have dealt with me in a thoroughly
professional way. As Judge Walsh has said, on the occasions that
were cited inside, I did indeed withhold information from the
Congress. I believe strongly that throughout, my actions were
motivated by what I believed was in the best foreign policy
interests of the United States.
   From the first moment when the Iran-Contra disclosures were made
in November of '86, I felt a profound personal obligation to
testify fully and voluntarily before the bodies that were formally
established to investigate this matter _ that includes the Tower
commission, the joint committee of the Congress, and the
independent counsel. I have done so, in more than 200 hours of
public and private testimony, without access to my records, or with
any request for or promise of immunity. I've told all that I know,
and it's on the public record for everyone to see. And I intend to
remain available to repeat it for as long as it's necessary to
bring this matter to a conclusion.
   I do think that it's unfortunate that the fundamental issue
here, that is, why congressional-executive relations broke down so
tragically, has not been and apparently cannot be dealt with by the
Congress or the courts. It seems to me important _ indeed,
imperative _ that an in-depth exploration of how to forge a better
working relationship is essential if the United States _ and I mean
by that the president and the Congress _ is to shoulder its global
leadership responsibility in the years ahead.
   And finally, I intend to do what I can to contribute to that
continuing effort.

<HEAD>Text Of Reagan's Statement On Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a text of the statement President
Reagan released Friday announcing a series of sanctions against the
government of Panama:
   The United States has had a long and mutually productive
relationship with Panama. The people of the United States consider
the people of Panama to be near neighbors and friends. The historic
Panama Canal treaties exemplify the close cooperation that has
traditionally characterized the friendship between the two
countries which created one of the great engineering works of the
human race.
   Out of concern for our friendship, we have been saddened and
increasingly worried in recent years as Panama's political crisis
deepened. Our policy with respect to the situation in Panama is
clear. We strongly favor a rapid restoration of democracy and the
resumption by the Panamanian Defense Forces of a role consistent
with constitutional democracy.
   In the present circumstances, I believe that General Noriega
would best serve his country by complying with the instruction of
President Delvalle to relinquish his post. In so doing, General
Noriega would contribute very substantially to reducing political
tensions and set the stage for a prompt transition to democracy in
Panama.
   Until such a time as democratic government is restored in
Panama, the U.S. cannot proceed on a `business as usual' basis.
Today, therefore, I have taken a number of steps against the
illegitimate Noriega regime that will contribute significantly to
the goal of a democratic, stable and prosperous Panama.
   I have directed that actions be taken to suspend trade
preferences available to Panama under the Generalized System of
Preferences and the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Further, in keeping
with the spirit of our war against drugs, I have ordered that
Panama be subject to intensified scrutiny by our Immigration and
Customs services in order to apprehend drug traffickers and money
launderers.
   Moreover, because we recognize President Delvalle as the lawful
head of government in Panama, I have directed that all departments
and agencies inventory all sources of funds due or payable to the
Republic of Panama from the U.S. government for purposes of
determining those that should be placed in escrow for the Delvalle
government on behalf of the Panamanian people. In that light, I
have directed that certain payments due to Panama from the Panama
Canal Commission be placed in escrow immediately. This step is in
complete compliance with our obligations under the terms of the
Panama Canal Treaties.
   I am prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to deny
the transfer of funds to the Noriega regime from other sources in
the U.S.
   We have welcomed the recent statements issued by President
Delvalle, the political parties and the civilian crusade of Panama
calling for a government of national reconciliation. We support
their goal of restoring democratic government and constitutional
order. Once Panamanians achieve this goal, the United States is
fully prepared to work with the government of Panama to help
quickly restore Panama's economic health.
   The United States has been, and remains, committed to fulfilling
faithfully its obligations under the Panama Canal treaties. We are
also prepared to resume our close working relationships with the
Panamanian Defense Forces once civilian government and
constitutional democracy are re-established.

   Here in brief are the sanctions imposed by
President Reagan against Panama on Friday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PAYMENTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Monthly payments of about $6.6 million for operations relating
to the Panama Canal will be held in escrow instead of being paid to
the government. Panama receives about $80 million from the canal
annually.
   Reagan also ordered all U.S. government agencies to inventory
payments due Panama ``for the purposes of determining those that
should be placed in escrow for the Delvalle government on behalf of
the Panamanian people.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRADE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Trade preferences available to Panama under the Generalized
System of Preferences, a special system for Third World countries,
and the Caribbean Basin Initiative, were suspended. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz said the action affects $96 million worth of
trade a year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Panama will be subject to intensified scrutiny by Immigration
and Customs Service officials ``to apprehend drug traffickers and
money launderers.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PIPELINE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   There was widespread speculation that Reagan would order
American companies to stop using a pipeline across Panama, which
generated revenue for the government. However, Shultz said those
funds already are frozen under a temporary restraining order issued
by U.S. courts.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FURTHER STEPS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Shultz said ``If there are further steps needed ... he will take
them.'' He refused to elaborate, saying, ``I think it's better to
leave that a little uncertain.''

<HEAD>Quotes From Presidential Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some of the latest comments by
candidates for the presidency:
   
   BOB DOLE, seeking to save a candidacy he says is ``hanging by
our fingernails'' and maintaining many voters are still undecided:
``It's like last-minute Christmas shoppers. Some people don't even
know what they're going to buy until the last 24 hours and then
they buy whatever is left. We don't want that to happen.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, declining a one-on-one confrontation with Dole,
recalling that he tried that with Ronald Reagan in 1980 and
probably lost the GOP nomination that year because of it: ``I may
be older, but I'm a lot smarter now, too.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, dining in Chicago's ``Greektown'' section and
commenting on whether he is trying to build an ethnic coalition:
``We want to put together a coalition of people all over this
country, whether they're first-generation or second-generation
Americans.''
   
   ALBERT GORE, continuing to attack Dukakis: ``His complete lack
of experience in foreign policy is, I think, a major issue at a
time when the next president must be prepared to seize the
opportunities for a new relationship with the Soviets.''
   
   PAT ROBERTSON, saying he will campaign all the way to the
Republican National Convention: ``I'm in it until New Orleans.''
   
   GARY HART, abandoning his presidential bid: ``The people are the
strength of this country. I said I wanted them to decide about my
candidacy. I got a fair hearing. And the people have decided. And
now I clearly should not go forward.''
   
   RICHARD GEPHARDT, complaining about negative television ads in
the South: ``I feel like Dukakis and Gore have mugged me in an
alley. They are borrowing my rhetoric, but they don't have any
substance behind it.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, urging blacks and whites in South Carolina to
unite around him: ``It's not so much black versus white as it is
barracudas eating us small fish. They don't eat fish by color. They
eat fish by size.''
   
   PAUL SIMON, asking educators to help him win Tuesday's Illinois
primary: ``We want to send a message to the nation from Illinois.
Part of that message is that for people who need quality education,
this administration has been out to lunch.''

<HEAD>Former Top Aide Thought Alleged Death Threat Would `Go Away'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top aide to Gov. Evan Mecham
acknowledged that he told the governor an alleged death threat by a
state official was a ``frivolous matter'' Mecham should forget
about.
   Max Hawkins, former head of the Department of Administration,
testified Friday at the Republican governor's impeachment trial
that he thought the alleged threat was ``a matter that would
probably go away by itself.''
   Mecham is accused of trying to thwart the attorney general's
investigation of the threat, allegedly made against a witness
testifying before a state grand jury that was investigating the
governor's campaign finances.
   Earlier Friday, another former state official, Sam Steiger,
testified the governor believed some of his decisions were
``divinely inspired.''
   Steiger had been asked by Sen. John Mawhinney whether Mecham, a
devout Mormon, ``could and would make decisions on specific pieces
of legislation through, he believed, some divine inspiration.''
   Asked by a reporter about Steiger's testimony, Mecham said only,
``Sam, he's a little off the wall in some of his comments, too.''
   Mormon doctrine holds that faithful Christians may receive
guidance from God regarding worldly endeavors, including their
occupations.
   The day marked the end of the second week of Mecham's Senate
trial. In addition to the death threat allegation, he is accused of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Former state prison construction chief Lee Watkins is accused of
threatening the life of former top Mecham aide Donna Carlson in a
conversation with Peggy Griffith, head of the Governor's Office of
Women's Services.
   Hawkins testified that he spoke on Nov. 13 with Watkins and Mrs.
Griffith and that he did not believe an actual death threat was
made.
   Instead, Hawkins said he felt that Watkins had said that Ms.
Carlson should keep her mouth shut and ``there are a lot of people
out there who are excitable and she could have harm come to her.''
   Hawkins said that when he told Watkins that Mrs. Griffith had
reported the matter to others, ``he laughed and thought that it was
absurd'' that she was telling anyone about it.
   Hawkins said he met with Mecham later that day and told the
governor that he had found ``that it was a little spat, a frivolous
matter'' and that Mecham should forget about it.
   Watkins has denied threatening Ms. Carlson's life. He is
scheduled to return to the stand Monday. Mecham could testify late
next week, said defense lawyer Fred Craft.
   Steiger blamed many of Mecham's troubles on Attorney General Bob
Corbin, a Republican.
   Steiger said Mecham resented Corbin because the governor took
the political heat for canceling a Martin Luther King holiday for
state workers when it was Corbin who first said the holiday was
illegally created through an executive proclamation by Mecham's
predecessor, Bruce Babbitt.
   Steiger faces an extortion charge brought by Corbin's office on
an unrelated matter.
   Corbin, contacted for comment on Steiger's testimony, said,
``Just remember the position he is in with regard to our office and
you can draw your own conclusions.''
   Mecham also faces a May 17 recall election and an April 21
criminal trial on charges of concealing the $350,000 loan.
   He is the first U.S. governor impeached in six decades and the
first ever in Arizona. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is
required to convict him, and lawmakers also could bar him from
holding any future public office.

   Mushers in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race traded rolling hills for the flat expanse of the
frozen Yukon River as they tried to catch 70-year-old Joe
Redington, who's led since Tuesday.
   Redington arrived at Ruby, a Yukon village 653 miles from the
race's start in Anchorage and the first checkpoint on the river, at
12:30 p.m. Friday and left six hours later.
   His closest rival, Martin Buser of Big Lake, pulled in at 5:05
p.m. In third was Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref, who arrived in
Ruby at 6:20 p.m.
   Four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was
running fourth. He checked out of Cripple, 120 miles back, at 7:25
p.m. Thursday. Joe Garnie of Teller followed Swenson out at 8:45
p.m., and defending champion Susan Butcher of Manley left at 9:50
p.m.
   Jerry Austin of St. Michael, running in eighth place, said he
and several mushers near him are still strong contenders in a race
that won't reach the finish line in Nome until later next week.
   ``Don't write off anybody that's three or six hours off the pace
right now,'' he said in Cripple. ``We're just inching our way up.
We're steadily gaining on them.''
   Butcher noted that Redington and Nayokpuk took their mandatory
24-hour layovers early in the race, an advantage because the
leaders later got bogged down in new snow. But that advantage may
be wearing thin, she said.
   ``It was a break for them in the beginning, but now they've been
going with no real long rest for a while. I think our dogs are
fresher,'' she said.
   But Nayokpuk, who couldn't keep up with Redington between
Cripple and Ruby, said Butcher and Swenson may have trouble
catching Redington.
   ``I tried to travel with Joe Redington from Cripple, but he
disappeared in a hurry,'' a tired Nayokpuk said as he sat on the
porch of a house in Ruby and changed his boots. ``I never saw him
again. He has the dogs. If he gets those dogs running to Nome, he's
going to be a hard one to beat.''
   Redington is known as the Father of the Iditarod for helping
found the race 16 years ago.
   The race started March 5 in Anchorage. After Ruby, mushers race
146 miles downriver to the village of Kaltag, then cross to the
Bering Sea coast for a final dash to Nome.
   The winner will collect $30,000 of a $150,000 purse; the next 19
finishers will split the rest. Two of the 52 teams that started the
race have dropped out.

   The arrest of two men is believed to have
solved 21 bank stick-ups committed in the last two months by a
motorcycle bandit and a robber dubbed ``The Old Man,'' police said.
   Mark MacAdoo, 22, of San Pedro, was arrested Thursday by FBI
agents and officers of the city police department's bank team while
awaiting a bus.
   MacAdoo was held in connection with 10 robberies in which the
bandit escaped on a motorcycle with a total of about $6,000, police
Lt. Bruce Meyer said Friday
   The second man, Howard Bonner, 59, nicknamed ``The Old Man''
because of his appearance, was arrested at a party Thursday night,
Meyer said. ``The Old Man'' stole about $20,000 in cash in 11
robberies, Meyer said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanians who have been unable to
cash their checks for 10 days faced cuts in public services today
as Washington increased economic pressure on the government to
force Panama's strongman to resign.
   President Reagan on Friday froze millions of dollars in
Panamanian assets in the United States and again called on Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down as chief of the 15,000-member
Defense Forces.
   Panama's new chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, met with his
Cabinet in an emergency session Friday.
   He was to meet with the Cabinet again today, ``to work out a
total package plan to deal with the crisis, especially a payment
plan for public employees who must be paid by March 15,'' said an
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The government reportedly was considering delaying or reducing
payments due Tuesday to nearly 150,000 government employees.
   Banks closed March 1 because of the lack of currency, leaving
Panamanians holding checks they cannot cash. Panama's currency is
the U.S. dollar.
   Solis Palma, ordered reductions in public services Friday as the
government's coffers ran low.
   The government ordered cutbacks in electricity and fuel
consumption, telephone and public vehicles use. It also announced a
two-hour reduction in working hours for government offices.
   Reagan said the United States will place fees due to Panama this
month from the Panama Canal into escrow until a government led by
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle can claim them. A $6.6
million payment of canal fees is due Tuesday.
   Pro-Noriega legislators ousted Delvalle from the presidency Feb.
26, a day after Delvalle tried to fire Noriega. Solis Palma was
named to replace Delvalle, who has been in hiding since.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle as Panama's
legitimate president.
   Reagan also suspended trade preferences granted Panama and
ordered increased scrutiny of the country by U.S. Immigration and
Customs Service officials to ``apprehend drug traffickers and money
launderers.''
   ``I believe that Gen. Noriega would best serve his country by
complying with the instruction of President Delvalle to relinquish
his post,'' Reagan said, calling Noriega's regime illegitimate.
   Noriega was indicted last month in the United States on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Boris Moreno, a Panamanian government spokesman, said the U.S.
actions created a ``state of war'' and set a dangerous precedent.
   ``This means that if the United States government does not like
the government of another country, it can withhold any funds
deposited in the United States,'' he said.
   Noriega made no comment on Reagan's new sanctions. An official
statement by the Foreign Ministry on the U.S. actions was expected.
   Riot police firing tear gas grenades and spraying a stinging,
acrid liquid from canisters prevented opposition parties from
holding a demonstration in the central banking district Friday.
   Three journalists were injured when police sprayed tear gas in
their faces at close range. They were: Lucia Annunziata, a reporter
with the newspaper La Repubblica of Rome; David Walters, a
photographer with the Miami Herald; and Manolo Iscala, a cameraman
for Spanish television.
   The U.S. sanctions were expected to deepen a cash-flow crisis
that has forced Panamanian banks to close for 10 consecutive days.
Attorneys for Delvalle have tied up an estimated $50 million in
official Panamanian funds in private U.S. banks.
   The government on Friday asked owners of four supermarket
chains, a department store and a pharmacy chain to act as
check-cashing houses for government employees. The owners refused,
saying it was up to the central bank to guarantee government checks.
   Businesses have not been accepting credit cards or checks for
purchases, only cash.

<HEAD>Air Ontario Pilots Strike Over Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON, Ontatio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 Air Ontario pilots walked
off the job today over a wage dispute, shutting down the regional
commuter services that handles 60,000 passengers monthly.
   Company spokesman Paul McKnicht said Friday that the pilots
agreed to continue flying Air Ontario air ambulances during the
strike.
   ``The bulk of our flight operations will be curtailed but
management personnel will be operating a few essential services in
remote communities of northern Ontario,'' McKnight said.
   Those communities, north of Timmins, depend on the airline to
fly in commodities such as food and fuel, he said.
   Negotiations between Air Ontario and the Canadian Air Line
Pilots Association broke off Thursday over pay. The pilots walked
off the job at 12:01 a.m. today.
   Union spokesman Roger Burgess-Webb said union officials have
told the airline they would be willing to resume talks but no
further discussions have been scheduled.
   Neither side would predict how long the strike would last, but
McKnight said it would be ``very very expensive.''
   The airline acts as a feeder for Air Canada flights from London,
where it is based, and 47 other communities around Ontario.
   Air Ontario Inc was created last May when Air Ontario Ltd.
merged with Austin Airways of Timmins. Air Canada owns 75 percent
of Air Ontario.
   Air Ontario has flights to Winnipeg and Montreal in Canada, and
to Hartford, Conn., and Cleveland, Ohio.

<HEAD>LaRouche Trial On Hold As Battle For FBI, CIA, Other Records
Mounts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three intelligence operatives who say the FBI and
CIA asked them to infiltrate Lyndon LaRouche's political operation
repeatedly tried to involve him in illegal activities, a LaRouche
attorney told a judge.
   Defense lawyer Michael Reilly on Friday urged U.S. District
Judge Robert E. Keeton to halt testimony in LaRouche's fraud and
conspiracy trial until prosecutors finish searching government
records for references to the operatives and evidence of
infiltration of LaRouche groups.
   Keeton canceled testimony for Monday, and said he would decide
then if a longer delay was necessary in the trial of LaRouche, six
aides and five LaRouche organizations.
   The defendants are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal
grand jury investigation into alleged credit card and loan fraud
during LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign.
   Keeton has ordered Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham to
search the files of the FBI, CIA, National Security Council and
Vice President George Bush.
   Reilly said he would present evidence of entrapment in private
if Keeton desired, but refused to be specific in open court. Keeton
did not request the information.
   The three operatives referred to by Reilly are retired Army Sgt.
Maj. Fred Lewis, Ron Tucker and Gary Howard. In an FBI document
declassified last week, Lewis, Tucker and Howard said they were
asked by the FBI and CIA to infiltrate LaRouche organizations.
   Markham filed a memo in which he charged the three men were
lying.
   ``A search of the FBI files relating to them shows that they
were never requested to penetrate the organization and that they
never did so,'' Markham said in the memo.
   Reilly disputed that, saying Markham's memo made no reference to
infiltration on behalf of the CIA. He also noted a memo between two
pivotal players in the Iran-Contra scandal in which Lewis is
referred to by last name, but only as proof Lewis was well known by
government officials.
   In a memo sent to then-NSC aide Oliver North by retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, one of North's principal operatives
in the network helping Nicaraguan Contra rebels, Secord said ``our
man'' told him Lewis had gathered ``info against LaRouche.''
   Lewis is the executive vice president of Rhyolite Management
Systems, a Texas company LaRouche lawyers contend was one of
several companies run by former military officers that the CIA used
to carry out covert activities.
   Howard and Tucker claim to be longtime government informants and
were the founders of another Texas company, now defunct, that
reportedly carried out covert activities.
   Markham originally told defense lawyers that ``our man''
referred to Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, a top FBI official involved in
counterintelligence. Markham later said he was mistaken and that
the reference was to John Cupp, a Secord associate who worked in
the resupply effort.
   Secord and Cupp, in interviews this week, also have said the
reference was to Cupp. Both denied any role in or knowledge of a
government effort to spy on LaRouche.
   Reilly on Friday filed a motion demanding the information
Markham relied on when he initially said Secord was referring to
Revell.
   ``If `our man here' is in fact Oliver Revell, it would create a
motive for high-level forces in the FBI and National Security
Council to conceal that in order to protect Mr. Revell,'' the
motion said.
   LaRouche attorneys said the information might help them prove
their contention that North asked the FBI and CIA to infiltrate
LaRouche groups because they were interfering with North's private
Contra resupply effort.
   An FBI spokesman said the agency would not comment on matters at
issue in a trial.

   The General Services Administration says it is

   The GSA said Friday it had extended the deadline by a month to

   Besides Sprint, only two other teams of companies are bidding on

   The Environmental Protection Agency says Ford
Motor Co. is recalling 214,900 cars from the 1982 and 1983 model
years because some of the vehicles have been exceeding federal
emission standards.
   The company is notifying owners of 185,000 cars from 1983
equipped with the 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine to bring them in
for adjustment of the exhaust air-injection systems. These cars
were sold as the Ford Escort, Escort EXP and Escort Wagon and the
Mercury Lynx, Lynx LN-7 and Lynx Wagon.
   The agency said Friday that Ford also will recall 29,900 cars
from the 1982 model year to fix an exhaust gas recirculation system
which can cause excessive emissions of nitrogen oxides.
   The cars affected all have 2.3-liter four-cylinder engines and
automatic transmissions. They were sold as the Ford Mustang,
Granada and Fairmont and the Mercury Capri and Zephyr. Cars
originally sold in California are not affected.
   Dealers will check the carburetor spacer plates, which allows
some exhaust to enter the intake manifold, and clean them of

<HEAD>New Fitness Program Designed To Prepare Marines For Combat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps has devised a new training
policy that mandates tougher physical conditioning programs to make
sure those who already have made it through basic training are
ready for combat.
   A new training policy order, signed last week and now being
prepared for distribution to the field, will require all commands
to refocus their physical conditioning program so that it goes
beyond just staying in shape to pass the standard physical fitness
test.
   The directive says commanders must ensure their Marines face ``a
minimum program of three hours per week'' of exercises that can be
divided between anaerobic conditioning, progressive resistance
training and aerobic conditioning.
   It says that Marine conditioning programs historically have
focused on physical fitness and adds: ``The focus, therefore, of
our programs must change. Each commander must emphasize unit and
combat fitness training, (instead of) physical fitness testing, and
reflect this distinction in training plans and schedules.''

   A proposal to conduct field tests in Wisconsin
for a genetically engineered bacterium designed to improve the
ability of alfalfa to use nitrogen in the air as a fertilizer has
won federal approval.
   The tests, approved Friday by the Environmental Protection
Agency, will be conducted in Pepin County, Wis., a county lying on
the Mississippi River about 20 miles southwest of Eau Claire.
   The bacterium, Rhizobium meliloti, grows naturally on alfalfa
roots, and mutant forms have been used to enhance plant growth in
the past.
   Using the techniques of recombinant DNA, BioTechnica Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass. has reinserted the genes responsible for nitrogen
use _ nitrogen fixation _ back into the organism, giving it two
copies of the genes.
   Lab and greenhouse tests indicate this will enhance alfalfa
yield, according to an EPA announcement when the company applied
for permission to test 13 months ago.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson won the coveted top spot for
New York's April 19 Democratic presidential primary ballot as the
result of a lottery draw at the state Board of Elections.
   Board spokesman Steven LaFever said Friday that the order of
appearance on the ballot, after Jackson, is expected to be
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, an uncommitted slate, political extremist
Lyndon LaRouche and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   LaRouche supporters have filed a challenge to Simon's nominating
petitions and the board is expected to rule on that challenge
Monday. After that, the ballot lineup is to be finalized.
   While the Democratic candidates run state wide by name and thus
have only one draw for ballot placement, Republican candidates rely
on delegate slates filed in each of the state's 34 congressional
districts. That means there's a separate ballot spot draw in each
congressional district for the GOP delegate slates.

   Jesse Jackson probably won't be on the

``inspirational role'' in a Democratic administration, says former
Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb.
   Robb said Jackson would be best ``in some part of the greater
domestic policy portion where he is simply without peer _ in
motivating young people, in encouraging young people not to get
involved with drugs, in encouraging people to pursue education,''
Robb told the Cleveland City Club on Friday.
   ``I think it's probably clear that if he is to have a role in
the next administration, it ought to be a role that is principally
an inspirational role and not a managerial role,'' he said.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo thinks independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh could do Democrats a favor by delaying the
release of any information that might link Vice President George
Bush to the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The worst thing that could happen now is to have some kind of
exposure of Irangate that knocks Bush out and makes room for (Bob)
Dole,'' Cuomo said Friday of Bush's recent success in Republican
Super Tuesday primaries.
   Cuomo has joked in the past that the best Republican ticket,
from a Democratic standpoint, would be ``Bush and Bush.'' The
governor has said Dole would be harder for the Democrats to beat.
   ``If there's going to be some revelation, let it come after it's
too late to change Bush,'' Cuomo said of Walsh's investigation.

<TEXT>
   Two car bombs exploded in the
capital's fashionable ``Pink Zone,'' sending diners diving for
cover and running for safety and injuring at least two people,
witnesses and officials said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombs that went off
Friday night in the affluent sector of San Salvador.
   Earlier in the day, about 400 union activists marched through
the city to demand the release of a detained labor leader.
   The first bomb went off in front of Flashback, a restaurant
adjacent to two cafes where leftist guerrillas killed 13 people,
including six Americans, in a machine gun attack in June 1985.
   The second bomb exploded about five minutes later in a parking
lot behind a Pizza Hut restaurant, causing no injuries.
   A Red Cross spokesman said two people _ a 12-year-old boy and a
middle-aged man _ were wounded in front of Flashback, one of a row
of trendy restaurants and night clubs in the Zona Rosa.
   The boy was taken to Bloom Hospital for Children. The spokesman,
who refused to give his name, said the extent of the boy's injuries
had not yet been determined, but that his life was not in danger.
   He said the man was treated at the Red Cross clinic for cuts to
his hand, and released.
   Glass shards littered the street in front of Flashback.
   The remains of three cars in front of Flashback were still
smoldering an hour after the 9:30 p.m. blasts. The car that held
the explosives was little more than a frame with some shreds of
sheet metal. Its make and year could not be immediately determined.
   The parking lot where the second blast occurred was nearly
empty. The car that held the second bomb also was reduced to a
twisted black metal skeleton. Bomb squad members there said they
had not determined what type of explosive was used.
   Flashback was crowded with diners that spilled onto the
restaurant's sidewalk tables when the blasts occurred.
   ``It was a powerful explosion. People dived for cover, then some
jumped up and ran,''said Porfirio Valladares, a waiter at Flashback.
   He said firefighters arrived in ``about 15 minutes'' and quickly
put out the flaming cars.
   About 400 union activists marched had through the capital
several hours earlier to demand that the Salvadoran governent free
Humberto Centeno, leader of the telecommunications workers union.
   One marcher was wounded by a gunshot to the leg when other
protesters identified an undercover security agent in their ranks
and confronted him. The agent fired a shot and fled.
   A pickup truck was set afire near the U.S. Embassy, where the
march stopped for 30 minutes to denounce U.S. support for the
Salvadoran government. Protesters defaced a U.S. Embassy wall.
   There were no confrontations with police or soldiers along the
five-mile march route. Uniformed security forces were not visible.
   Centeno was arrested Thursday night after about 50 union members
occupied the Labor Ministry in demand of higher pay and
reinstatement of fired workers.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, stumping for votes on home turf in
advance of Tuesday's Illinois Democratic primary, says his
presidential campaign is in its second phase _ a phase where people
can view him as a winner.
   Many of his supporters had hoped he would do well in other state
contests but didn't really believe it would happen, Jackson said
Friday night. But his campaign has been buoyed by strong finishes
from the South to the Midwest and north to Alaska.
   ``So now we move into the second phase _ when you hope it and
believe it. Now, let's achieve it,'' Jackson told a crowd of more
than 1,000 cheering supporters who jammed a hotel ballroom for a
$50-per-person fund raiser.
   Jackson said he's finished first or second in 22 of 28 state
political contests so far despite being outspent by his Democratic
opponents. He said his message is making believers of those who
thought he could not win because he is black.
   ``Don't judge the campaign by its budget,'' he told the crowd.
``Judge it by its mission and its message.''
   The message Friday night included familiar themes: a campaign
against drugs; emphasis on prenatal care and daycare for the young
instead of ``jail care and welfare'' as they grow older; and a push
for jobs.
   In Illinois, polls show Jackson's top opponents are Sen. Paul
Simon, another home state favorite, and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the front-runner in delegates. Jackson has refused to
attack his party rivals.
   ``If I stop to hit them, I might break my stride,'' he said.
   And he said he has proven his ability to manage a tight budget.
   ``If my competitors had my budget, they could not survive. If I
had their budget, they could surrender,'' Jackson said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi could have helped Wedtech
Corp. for free, but chose to help plunder millions of dollars from
the Bronx defense contractor, a prosecutor told jurors in the
congressman's racketeering trial.
   ``The crime is not what the congressman did. The crime is that
he was paid for what he did, the extortion and bribes,'' Howard
Wilson, an assistant U.S. attorney, said Friday in U.S. District
Court.
   Wilson's opening statement to jurors hearing the case of Biaggi
and six co-defendants outlined how ``a little company in the
Bronx'' was turned into ``an enterprise that was to be plundered,
to be used by the people on trial here.''
   ``And in the end, because of the corruption, because of the
greed, because of the lies, the company went kaput,'' he said.
   Wedtech, formed in 1965 as a machine shop, capitalized on laws
allocating government contracts for minority-owned enterprises, and
by 1985 had grown into a defense contractor with 1,000 employees
and $117 million in revenue.
   The company suspended operations and laid off most of its
workers in December 1986, then filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act.
   The co-defendants are former Bronx Borough President Stanley
Simon, 57; Bernard G. Ehrlich, 59, of Bedford, Biaggi's former law
partner and a former major general in the New York National Guard;
Biaggi's son, Richard, 38, of Fort Lee, N.J.; Peter Neglia, 39, of
Armonk, the former regional administrator of the Small Business
Administration; former Wedtech chairman John Mariotta, 57, of
Scarsdale and Ronald Betso, 39, of Brooklyn, a former policeman and
friend of Neglia's.
   ``All treated this company like a gold mine,'' said Wilson.
   The defendants claimed that Mariotta, who is Hispanic, was the
majority owner of Wedtech, entitling the company to no-bid federal
contracts, Wilson said.But Mariotta owned less than half, said the
prosecutor.
   Rep. Biaggi, who at one point demanded 5 percent of Wedtech's
revenues, was given 5 percent of Wedtech stock, which was put in
his son's name, Wilson said. The elder Biaggi and Ehrlich made $4
million from the 225,000 Wedtech shares they received, he said.
   At another point, Biaggi, 70, asked for $50,000 for expediting a
lease before the city's Board of Estimate, the prosecutor said.
   Simon demanded and received more than $50,000 in cash, meals,
chips for gambling at Atlantic City, N.J., casinos, marble for his
home, a trip to Rome and charitable contributions in his name,
Wilson said.
   Simon also got a Wedtech job for his brother-in-law and took
half his raises over the years, Wilson said.
   Neglia was Wedtech's ``paid-for friend,'' Wilson said. Among
other things, Wilson claimed, Neglia warned the company about a
congressional probe.
   Neglia was paid with stock options, frequent meals,
contributions to the Republican Party in his name and the promise
of a job on leaving government, Wilson said. Less than a month
after leaving office in early 1986, he went to work for the law
firm of Ehrlich and the younger Biaggi.
   Mariotta embezzled about $1 million and sold Wedtech stock worth
$6 million to $8 million, Wilson said.
   Ehrlich was ``Mario Biaggi's partner in the plunder of Wedtech.
When he got it, he split it,'' charged Wilson, who said Richard
Biaggi ``became the front man.''
   Wilson said the two men's law firm earned $1 million in
retainers' fees from Wedtech.
   Betso took stock options in his name for his friend Neglia,
Wilson alleged, then lied about it to the Department of Labor.
   Wilson promised testimony to back up his claims from Wedtech
accountants, supervisors and workers; Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.;
and four former Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to crimes
involving the company.
   Defense attorneys begin presenting their arguments Monday.
   The House Ethics Committee announced last month it would
recommend Biaggi be expelled following his conviction last year in
another case on charges he accepted illegal paid vacations from an
old friend and political ally.
   Biaggi had asked the committee not to act until his appeal of
that conviction was settled. The panel decided to postpone bringing
the matter before the full House.

   A relative of Andrei Sakharov says he asked Lyndon
LaRouche's help in getting the dissident out of the Soviet Union
but denied a claim by LaRouche attorneys that he was acting at the
bidding of U.S. intelligence operatives.
   ``We came to him on our own initiative,'' Efram Yankelovich said
in a telephone interview Friday. ``Nobody asked us or directed us
or suggested it to us.''
   Yankelovich is married to the daughter of Yelena Bonner,
Sakharov's wife.
   LaRouche attorney Michael Reilly said Yankelovich and Alexei
Semyonov, Sakharov's stepson, approached a LaRouche aide in 1984
and said a third party promised to spirit Sakharov and Bonner out
of the Soviet Union if LaRouche paid $2 million.
   LaRouche refused to get involved and ended the discussions after
the Sakharov relatives identified the third party as a man the
LaRouche organization believed was trying to entrap them, Reilly
said.
   Attorneys for LaRouche, six aides and five organizations on
trial here on fraud and conspiracy charges were denied access
Friday to classified FBI documents referring to an attempt to get
Sakharov and Bonner out of the Soviet Union.
   The defense lawyers earlier this week were given declassified
excerpts from the material. The excerpts say FBI files indicate
that in 1984 two intelligence operatives approached two Sakharov
relatives and told them they could get Sakharov and Bonner out of
the Soviet Union for $2 million.
   The operatives, Gary Howard and Ron Tucker, are quoted in the
same FBI document as saying they and a third man, retired Army Sgt.
Maj. Fred Lewis, had been asked by the FBI and the CIA to
infiltrate LaRouche organizations.
   Yankelovich said he never heard of Tucker or Howard.
   The LaRouche lawyers want the entire FBI file to help pursue
leads they say show numerous attempts by government informants and
operatives to entrap LaRouche.
   But U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton said the file was
properly classified and that the material not already given the
defense lawyers was irrelevant.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said the file was created
in the Boston FBI office during an investigation of possible fraud
against Sakharov's relatives and possible violations of the
Neutrality Act, which prohibits interference in foreign countries.
   Tucker and Howard, in a $1.4 million lawsuit against the
government, describe themselves as longtime operatives involved in
government sting operations.
   In the suit, Tucker and Howard said they gathered evidence
against an arms merchant planning to sell weapons to Iran but that
the government refused to prosecute the case because it would have
exposed the Iran-Contra scandal.

<HEAD>Gunman Overpowered After Firing Pistol Inside Jet, One Wounded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man aboard a Pakistani Airlines jet
fired two shots and wounded a security guard today before being
overpowered minutes before the aircraft was to land near the Afghan
border, officials said.
   Karachi airport authorities said there were no other injuries
among the 143 passengers and 13 crew members aboard the A-300
Airbus. The jet, on a domestic flight from Karachi to Quetar,
landed safely.
   The incident occurred as the jet prepared to land at Quetta, a
city near the Afghanistan border in western Pakistan.
   The man entered the cockpit with a revolver and two security
guards tried to grab him, said the officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   A scuffle ensued in the first class cabin during which the man
discharged his gun twice, wounding one of the guards, according to
officials.
   They said the second guard managed to subdue the gunman.
   Officials said the gunman has not been identified and his motive
was unclear.
   Pakistan's national news agency, APP, reported that the gunman
also was injured, but airport officials could not immediately
confirm this.
   They could not explain either how the man was able to smuggle a
firearm aboard the plane.
   Airport security usually is extremely strict in Pakistan.
Passengers pass through two metal detectors and have their carry-on
luggage inspected at least three times before boarding a flight.

   Survivors of a commuter airliner crash that
claimed nine lives expressed outrage at a government report that
the pilot had traces of cocaine in his body.
   ``It makes me mad,'' said Nancy Hill of Cortez, who suffered a
broken leg and a dislocated shoulder in the Jan. 19 Continental
Express accident outside Durango. ``We should have protection from
this kind of thing.''
   Both the pilot and co-pilot died in the crash, and investigators
have not determined which one was flying at the time.
   The eight survivors were rescued after one, Peter Schauer,
trudged 1{ miles over a snowy mountainside to a house.
   ``Our lives will never be the same, and when there is this kind
of problem involved, you have to be even more angry,'' Schauer said
Friday.
   The toxicology report released Friday in Washington said pilot
Steven S. Silver had .022 micrograms per milliliter of
benzoylecgonine, the principal metabolite of cocaine, in his
bloodstream.
   He also had 1.8 micrograms per milliliter of metabolized cocaine
and .022 micrograms of cocaine in his urine, according to the
report by the National Transportation Safety Board's Bureau of
Technology.
   ``I would say that is a small amount'' of cocaine, said Dr.
Merrit M. Birky, an NTSB chemist who had an outside lab analyze the
samples. ``It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the
significance of this.''
   Birky said cocaine is quickly converted to benzoylecgonine in
the bloodstream and has a half-life of seven hours in the body. But
Birky said he was unable to say how much cocaine the pilot ingested
or when he ingested it.
   The NTSB did not characterize the finding as a cause of the
accident or indicate whether the pilot might have been impaired.
   Silver, 36, of Denver was an employee of Trans-Colorado Airlines
Inc. of Colorado Springs. Trans-Colorado leases planes and crews to
Rocky Mountain Airways, a Continental Airlines subsidiary that
operates in Colorado as Continental Express.
   The Swearingen Metro III twin-engine turboprop crashed in a
mountainous area in southwestern Colorado after it was given
clearance to land at Durango-La Plata County Airport.
   The report said the toxicology report on co-pilot Ralph Harvey,
42, of Denver will be released later.
   Bill White, a Denver attorney acting as Trans-Colorado's
spokesman Friday, said the company was ``obviously surprised. We're
concerned.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association said it was ``deeply disturbed''
by the report, but said it ``leaves unanswered more questions than
it resolves.''
   George James, president of Airline Economics Inc., a Washington
consulting firm to the airline industry, said he was unaware of any
other commercial airline accident in which drug use had been
involved.
   The Department of Transportation on Thursday proposed a drug
testing program for more than a half million airline employees.
   In a statement Friday, Transportation Secretary James Burnley
called the evidence of drug use by Silver ``a tragic reminder that
not even commercial aviation is exempt from the drug abuse problem
which plagues our society.''

   Two passengers on a Greyhound bus
suffered gunshot wounds today when a bullet hit the vehicle as it
rolled down a downtown highway, police said.
   The bullet apparently struck the bus near the middle of the
vehicle around 1 a.m., hit the first victim's foot, then lodged in
the second victim's leg, said police Detective Charles Dudley.
   Passengers Sujal Badami, 24, of Clemson, S.C., and Eric Douglas,
21, of Denmark, S.C., were treated at Erlanger Medical Center and
released, said hospital spokeswoman Debbie Goad.
   Badami was wounded in the foot and Douglas in the leg.
   The shooting on Interstate 124 followed a similar case Thursday,
in which a truck driver was seriously wounded when two shots
pierced his tractor-trailer on the interstate, police said.
   Sam Lands, hit in the chest and wrist, was in satisfactory
condition today at Erlanger, Ms. Goad said.
   The bus was hit as it headed for Memphis, police said. The
driver said he pulled over and flagged down a passing truck driver,
who used his citizens band radio to call police.
   The bus driver said company policy prohibited him from giving
his name.
   A drunken driver struck the bus a glancing blow while it was
parked on the side of the interstate, police said. The driver,
whose name was not released, was arrested, and was to be charged
later today, police said.
   Police have no suspects in either shooting, and could not say
until ballistics tests were completed if they were related. It was
not clear whether the shot that struck the bus was fired by a
sniper or from a passing car.

   A 5-year-old died after his stepfather allegedly
beat him with a tree limb, a belt and his hands because the boy
couldn't recite the alphabet past ``G,'' authorities said.
   Dwayne Blocker, 24, was being held in the Cook County Jail today
on $150,000 bond, said a jailer who refused to give her name. He is
to be arraigned April 4.
   Blocker, who was indicted on murder charges by a county grand
jury Friday, admitted beating stepson Charles Moss because he could
only reach ``G'' when Blocked asked him to say the alphabet, said
police Lt. James Phelan.
   The boy's mother, Joyce Blocker, 21, was sick Wednesday and
Blocker picked up Charles from preschool, Phelan said.
   After the child could not complete the alphabet, Blocker
shouted, ``Do it again,'' the lieutenant said.
   ``Then he punched him several times, hit him with a belt several
times and then went outside and got a tree branch and struck him
several more times,'' Phelan said.
   After the attack, the boy ran upstairs to his mother's room,
said David Schneidman, a spokesman for the state Department of
Children and Family Services.
   Charles collapsed in the room, and the stepfather tried to
revive him, Schneidman said.
   The youngster, who died at St. Francis Cabrini Hospital, had a
broken arm, bruises on his leg and a solid bruise from the shoulder
blade to his buttocks, Schneidman said.
   ``When this guy said he became angry because the boy could not
get past the letter G, that sounds absurd, ridiculous,'' he said.
``But frankly, reasons like that are very common among child
abusers.
   ``In severe abuse cases, there are several things that can
trigger an incident,'' said Schneidman. ``The child's learning
ability is one of the common reasons. Others are eating habits and
toilet training.''
   Another child from the family, 1-year-old Jasmine Blocker, was
admitted to the hospital to check for potential abuse, Schneidman
said. The state has moved to gain temporary custody of her.

<HEAD>Discouraging Results From Study on Developing AIDS From Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE CARPENTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a very small number of people carrying
the AIDS virus will fail to develop some form of the disease within
six years, scientists predicted today.
   A study estimates that at least 75 percent of those with the
virus will contract AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex in that period.
   ``The big question still is, `Will everybody at some point
progress (from the virus to AIDS) ... or is there a chance that
some people will be able to ride it out for 15 years?''' said Paul
O'Malley, author of an earlier study on the virus' progression.
   Results of the study were published in today's editions of the
British Medical Journal.
   The researchers at the University of California, San Francisco
and other institutions studied 288 men with the virus for three
years,
   The scientists used five ``markers'' in the blood to estimate
how many would contract AIDS or ARC, a milder form of acquired
immune defiency syndrome which generally develops into active AIDS.
The markers included measurements of proteins and cells.
   Twenty-two percent of the participants developed AIDS during the
three-year period and 19 percent progressed to ARC. Tests on
another 24 percent showed abnormalities which the researchers found
were highly predictive of AIDS or ARC.
   Although that adds up to 65 percent, the researchers
extrapolated that at least another 10 percent of people infected
with HIV, or human immunodefiency virus, will develop some form of
the disease for a total of 75 percent.
   The scientists called the estimate conservative, saying the
actual rate of progression may be much higher.
   Even the men who had not developed AIDS or ARC after three years
showed clear signs of progression toward a worsened condition in
their blood markers, the study found.
   ``HIV infection is much more serious than we thought in the
early days,'' said Andrew Moss, UCSF associate professor of
epidemiology and international health at San Francisco General
Hospital. ``It may take eight or nine years, but eventually the
infected person will probably get AIDS.
   ``What we saw was that the number of those showing no effects
from HIV infection is very small,'' added Moss. ``This means that
if you are infected with the AIDS virus, you will almost certainly
go on to get AIDS,'' he said.
   O'Malley, the director of the city Health Department's AIDS
research project, said the new study apparently provides important
information for HIV-positive people trying to decide whether to
take immediate risks with anti-viral drugs or await advances in
treatment.
   ``As each year progresses we know more, but we still can't fully
answer it,'' said O'Malley. His study, released in February 1987,
determined that the risk of developing AIDS increases in the second
five years after infection.
   Moss and his colleagues in the study are urging the expansion of
current trials of antiviral drugs on people who are HIV positive,
but do not have symptoms of ARC or AIDS.
   ``We need to speed up the trials of the current drugs and look
for more treatments as well,'' Moss said.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported this week that
55,167 cases of AIDS have been reported since June 1981 and 30,932
of those people have died.

<HEAD>Blizzard Keeps Its Punch; Golfball-Sized Hail Hits Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A major blizzard continued blasting the northern Plains today,
packing winds of 30 to 50 mph that reduced visibility to near zero
and piled up snow in drifts up to 10 feet high.
   A band of showers and thunderstorms spawned by the same storm
system produced hail the size of golfballs in north-central Texas.
The rain extended across central Arkansas and central Illinois into
southwest Wisconsin and southeast Minnesota.
   Areas hit hard by the blizzard Friday included northeast
Colorado, western and north-central Nebraska, western South Dakota
and eastern Wyoming. Roads remain closed in many areas. Bitterly
cold wind chills of 10 to 25 below zero were common.
   Blizzard warnings remained in effect today over much of the
eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota.
   Winter storm warnings or winter storm watches were up in
sections of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan.
   On Friday, snow was reported as deep as 31 inches, with snow
drifts 5 feet deep in Chadron, Neb. Drifts measured 10 feet in
Cody, although only 6 to 7 inches fell. Snowshowers also lingered
over the central Rockies.
   Strong winds over the northern Plains included gusts to 69 mph
at Akron, Colo. Wind gusts over 50 mph were clocked at Rapid city,
S.D.; Scottsbluff, Neb.; Limon, Colo.; and Duluth, Minn.
   There were numerous reports of large hail across north-central
Texas Friday night. Hail the size of golfballs was reported in De
Soto and Terrell. In Arkansas, 1-inch hail fell at Burg.
   Today's forecast called for snow and strong winds from the
Dakotas and Nebraska across the upper Mississippi Valley into upper
Michigan; strong winds in Kansas and Oklahoma; snowshowers
lingering over the northern and central Rockies and thunderstorms
extending from Alabama, Mississippi and northwest Georgia across
the Tennessee Valley, the Ohio Valley and the middle Mississippi
Valley, with rain reaching into southern Wisconsin, lower Michigan
and the lower Great Lakes region.
   Highs were expected in the 20s and 30s from the northern and
central Rockies across the northern two-thirds of the Plains and
the upper Mississippi Valley into upper Michigan, upstate New York
and northern New England; and the 70s and 80s from southern Texas
across the central Gulf coast states and the southern Atlantic
coast states, with a few readings in the 70s across Southern
California and southwest Arizona. The rest of the nation will have
highs in the 40s, 50s or 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 1
degree at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 70 degrees at Miami, Key West,
Fla., and Brownsville, Texas.

   The Rev. Jamie Mock-Robbins, an early leader in
the sanctuary movement to aid Central American refugees, died at
age 32.
   Mock-Robbins, co-pastor of University Baptist Church, died on
Thursday. He had been battling cancer since October, The Seattle
Times said.
   In 1982, under the direction of Mock-Robbins and the Rev.
Donovan Cook, University Baptist became the first church in the
Pacific Northwest to declare itself a sanctuary for refugees
fleeing persecution in Central America. About 50 refugees have been
sheltered at the church.
   Mock-Robbins also spent much of the past four years in Central
America working with schools and churches. He organized relief in
1986 for victims of the San Salvador earthquake, which left about
1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands injured and homeless.
   ``I have never known anyone as loving and gentle and dedicated
to living the gospel, and he demonstrated it daily, especially in
work in Central America,'' said Cook.
   Mock-Robbins also attended and helped organize demonstrations
and vigils in Seattle to protest U.S. military intervention in
Central American countries.
   A native of Dearborn, Mich., Mock-Robbins was a graduate of
Albion College and Andover-Newton Theological Seminary in Boston.
   He is survived by his wife, Katherine Mock-Robbins; his parents
from Dearborn, Mich., and a sister.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Sunday at University
Baptist.

<TEXT>
   Richard Croxton Adams, who invented the
paint roller to help America adapt to a World War II shortage of
brushes, died at the age of 76.
   Adams, a descendant of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy
Adams, suffered a stroke last week and died Wednesday in Grossmont
hospital, said his wife, Mary.
   An engineer, industrialist and civic leader, Adams invented and
held the first patent on the paint roller. He developed it in his
basement workshop while working in the market research department
of the Sherwin-Williams Paint Co. in 1940.
   The invention was spurred by a shortage of paint brushes caused
by World War II, then raging in Europe.
   At the time of his death, Adams was working with a group of
Southern California educators to establish a research center where
academicians could study biological and sociological issues.
   In addition to his wife, Adams is survived by three sons, a
brother and eight grandchildren.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Monday.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Raid On Iranian Oil Tanker In Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMIR F. GHATTAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq claimed today it raided an Iranian
oil tanker in the Persian Gulf, resuming a campaign to cut Tehran's
economic lifeline after the foes halted 12 days of missile attacks
on each other's cities.
   The raid came amid reports from U.S. military sources in
Washington that Iran has started building launch pads for Silkworm
anti-ship missiles on its Abu Musa island near the Strait of
Hormuz, the narrow entrance at the gulf's southern end.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as
saying Iraqi warplanes on Friday night attacked a ``very large
maritime target'' _ usually meaning an Iranian oil tanker _ off the
Iranian coast, scoring ``an accurate and effective hit.''
   ``The air raid was within the framework of Iraq's firm and
legitimate right in tearing the arteries of oil supplies of the
Iranian regime to deprive it of employing its oil revenues for the
purposes of aggression,'' said the spokesman, who was not
identified.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, gave no other details, and the
attack could not be immediately confirmed by independent shipping
executives in the gulf. Iran usually does not report attacks on its
shipping.
   The ship raid occurred only hours after a truce went into effect
to stop the unprecedented long-range missile duel in the ``war of
the cities'' that had begun Feb. 29.
   Iraq fired eight rockets at Tehran and three at the holy city of
Qom, south of Tehran, Friday afternoon just 16 minutes before
Baghdad said it would stop shooting.
   More than 400 ships of different nationalities have been damaged
in the gulf since the Iran-Iraq war broke out in 1980. The ``tanker
war'' began in early 1984.
   Iraq on Friday had claimed another a ship attack but that also
could not be confirmed.
   Iraq's last confirmed attack on a ship was on Tuesday, when
warplanes blasted a Maltese-flag tanker shuttling Iranian crude.
   That attack was preceded by a lull since Feb. 12, the last time
Iraqi warplanes were confirmed to have hit a ship.
   Defense officials in Washington, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Iranians are building launching pads in Abu
Musa. They added that U.S. intelligence had not yet detected
efforts by Iran to move any of its Chinese-built Silkworms to the
island, which serves as base for Revolutionary Guards.
   Iran has batteries of Silkworms, which have a range of about 50
miles, on its shore along the Strait of Hormuz.
   It also has fired missiles believed to be Silkworms into
Kuwait's main oil port from the Faw Peninsula, which it captured
from Iraq in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Steve Mills, a vaudeville comic who began
his show biz career at age 14 before World War I and continued
performing until the late '70s, has died. He was 92.
   Mills, who had been mostly confined to his home since a 1977
stroke, died Wednesday at his home in this suburb south of
Providence.
   Mills began his career when he played Amateur Night with Fred
Allen and Benny Rubin in his hometown of Boston. He then formed the
Castle Trio with friends and broke into vaudeville in the Boston
area shortly before the war.
   After serving as an Army bugler at Fort Devens, Mass., in 1918,
Mills joined the major vaudeville and burlesque circuits.
   In 1924, he performed in Billy Gilbert's ``Whiz Bang Babies''
and was lead comedian for the first time in 1926 in ``Miss
Tabasco.'' In 1928, Mills was ``top banana'' for Billy Minsky at
the National Winter Garden Theatre in New York.
   After signing with the Shubert organization in the early 1930s,
Mills appeared in ``Three Little Girls,'' ``No, No Nannette'' and
``Prince of Pilsen.''
   After burlesque closed down in New York in 1937, Mills played
New England nightclubs until 1944, when he rejoined Shubert to
perform in the operettas ``Wildflower'' and ``Firefly.''
   He played ``A Lady Says Yes'' in New York, then returned to New
England clubs before buying his Warwick home in 1947.
   In the 1960s and early 1970s, Mills appeared on TV talk shows
and performed with Mildred Natwick and Hans Conried in ``70 Girls
70'' in New York, the ``Best Of Burlesque'' show in Las Vegas,
Nev., and the ``Minsky Show'' in Miami.
   He last appeared on stage in 1977 in the show ``This Was
Burlesque,''
   Mills is survived by his wife, Abagail, a daughter and four
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A wildfire raged through west Texas today
after burning 200,000 acres of prarie, killing livestock,
threatening homes and closing roads.
   No people were reported killed or seriously injured in the
blaze, which an army of hundreds fought Friday. Officials said
could take several days to extinguish the fire.
   ``It looked like we were in hell _ fire all around. Pretty
spooky,'' Jimmy T. Brooks, a 40-year-old cowboy, said here Friday
before going back to the battle.
   Winds diminished from 30 mph to about 10 mph, helping
firefighters bring parts of the blaze under control, said Terry
Harlow of Shackelford County's emergency management team.
   The fire destroyed a mobile home and several hunting sheds in
the sparsely populated region about 150 miles west of Dallas. The
blaze also damaged oil field equipment and ranch fences.
   The fire covered an area about 60 miles long and 25 miles wide
in portions of Callahan, Shackelford and Throckmorton counties,
officials said, and a 20-mile wide swath of the blaze burned out of
control. A few families were evacuated from ranches, officials said.
   Joe Fox, the Texas Forest Service official overseeing the
firefighting effort, predicted it could take another four days to
extinguish the blaze.
   Albany, a town of about 2,500 people and the county seat of
Shackelford, was under siege Friday. A change in wind direction
brought the fire to within 100 yards of the town, said Lawrence
Winkler, a spokesman for the Shackelford County emergency division.
But the wind died down.
   All four major highways through Albany were closed by heavy
smoke, officials said.
   Smoke and haze also cast a light fog-like pall over the
Dallas-Fort Worth area late Friday afternoon, and some Fort Worth
residents said they smelled the smoke.
   Gov. Bill Clements dispatched 100 National Guard soldiers. They
joined west Texas fire departments, Texas Forest Service
firefighters, state highway department employees, units from
Abilene's Dyess Air Force Base and the Fort Worth Fire Department.
Winkler said volunteer oilfield workers also pitched in.
   Some firefighters suffered minor burns and were temporarily
overcome by smoke, officials said.
   At the 88-year-old Nail Ranch, an estimated 35,000 acres were
scorched, an unknown number of cattle lost and 20-25 miles of fence
destroyed, said Ronnie Nail, one of the ranch heirs.
   Shifting winds made it difficult to determine where the fire
would spread, and in some cases firefighters were nearly surrounded
by the swiftly moving flames.
   One of the fires may have started when someone was burning tires
near here, while two others appeared to have formed along Farm Road
604 and may have been caused by passing motorists.
   There was speculation that trash fires may have sparked the
blazes Thursday, when humidity dipped to 7 percent.

<HEAD>Spain Offers Noriega Political Asylum</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-US-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain told the United States it would give
political asylum to Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega if it helps end that Central American country's political
crisis, a newspaper reported today.
   Spain's leading daily, the independent El Pais, quoted Jose
Antonio Yanez, as saying, ``Spain, in a critical situation, would
be prepared to receive Noriega, if it can lead to a solution'' of
the Panamanian political situation.
   Yanez is a top policy adviser to Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez. Elena Chi, Consul at the Panamanian Embassy in Madrid,
told The Associated Press that Noriega had no plans to seek asylum
in Spain.
   Panamanian President Eric Arturo Del Valle was dismissed Feb.
26, a day after he tried to fire Noriega. As chief of the
15,000-strong Defense Forces, Noriega is considered the real power
behind the civilian government.
   Despite Delvalle's ouster by the Noriega-dominated National
Assembly, the United States still considers Delvalle Panama's
legitimate president.
   The United Staets has frozen official Panamanian government
funds deposited in U.S. banks, creating a financial crisis in
Panama, whose currency is the U.S. dollar.
   El Pais said Yanez, who ended a three-day visit to Washington
Friday, expressed Spain's position in a one-hour meeting Friday
with Elliot Abrams, U.S. undersecretary of State for interamerican
affairs.
   It said Spain's offer was made on condition that the U.S.
government not seek Noriega's extradition from Spain to face
indictments in Florida on charges of drug trafficking and money
laundering. Noriega has rejected the accusations.
   Other conditions set by Spain included that Noriega himself
request asylum in Spain and that Panama's political opposition
agree to the move, the newspaper said.
   Yanez, the paper said, also received a guarantee from the United
States that it would respect the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977
calling for the U.S. government to turn over control of the Panama
Canal at the end of 1999.
   The paper also reported the United States delivered a message to
Noriega in which it promised the military leader the Washington
would not oppose his residence in a third country.
   Gabriel Lewis, a former Panamanian ambassador to the United
States now leading the opposition to Noriega in Washington, told El
Pais he appreciated Spain's offer of asylum for Noriega ``because
his leaving would clear up the Panamanian crisis.''
   The newspaper also quoted Panamanian Defense Forces spokesman
Maj. Edgardo Lopez as saying: ``Once and for all: Noriega is going
to stay in Panama and, if necessary, die in Panama, but he will
never accept a shameful exit.''

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters gathered outside the office of
President Kurt Waldheim today to demand that he resign because of
his World War II past as an officer in the German army.
   A small group of demonstrators maintained an overnight vigil on
the square in front of the president's office, and said they will
remain until late Sunday.
   The protesters fixed a 10-foot-long banner to a nearby fence
that read, ``Who Will Make Waldheim Resign.''
   ``We know that this will not force him to resign,'' said one
protester, who identified herself only as a 23-year-old student at
Vienna University.
   ``But hopefully it will help keep attention focused on him, and
remind people what a problem he has become for our country,'' she
added.
   The demonstrators were among 300 people protesting outside the
imperial Hofburg Palace on Friday, the 50th anniversary of
Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany.
   Organizers said they expected thousands of people for an
afternoon protest near the president's office in the center of the
capital.
   Waldheim attended several events marking the annexation, but the
controversy forced him to drop plans to deliver a major address.
   Austria's president normally is the keynote speaker for such
events, but Waldheim was the silent guest at several of the
ceremonies and did not play a major role.
   Waldheim concealed his role as a German army lieutenant in the
Balkans until it was disclosed in the media in March 1986, but he
has said he will not leave office until his term expires in 1992.
   Last year, the U.S. Justice Department placed the former U.N.
secretary-general on a list of undesirable persons, effectively
barring him from entering the country.
   A panel of historians concluded last month that Waldheim was in
close proximity to Nazi war crimes, including the deportation to
death camps of Jews and the murders of partisans, but did nothing
to prevent them.
   The report left open the question of Waldheim's guilt or
innocence in atrocities, fueling pressure that he resign.
   Waldheim always has denied any wrongdoing.
   Ceremonies Friday marking Anshluss drew few large crowds. Shops,
schools and businesses remained open, and many Viennese ignored a
nationwide moment of silence. Some public transport stood still and
the state-run radio fell silent during the observance.
   Austria's largest-circulation daily, the tabloid Neue Kronen
Zeitung, gave the anniversary events scant coverage.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told a special Cabinet session Friday
that the Nazi invasion and annexation, or Anschluss, mattered to
Austrian politics today.
   ``The events of 50 years ago pose relevant, fundamental
questions about the essence of politics,'' Vranitzky said. ``If one
attempts to avoid them, they sooner or later return with greater
emphasis.''
   Vranitzky, in a later address to 900 students in Vienna's
historic Musikverein concert hall, urged young Austrians not to
``make blanket accusations against an older generation or to
reproach them'' for past mistakes.
   Speaking Friday at an evening service in Vienna's landmark St.
Stephen's Cathedral, Roman Catholic Archbishop Karl Berg of
Salzburg called on Austrians to recognize the mistakes of the past.
   Austrians must ``recognize guilt, feel regret and ask for
forgiveness,'' Berg told the several thousand people gathered in
the Gothic cathedral.

<HEAD>Inmate Claims His Life Sentence Satisfied Because He Died Briefly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate convicted of murdering two police
officers claims he has satisfied his sentence of 20 years to life
in prison because he ``died'' briefly during open-heart surgery.
   The heart and respiratory functions of Jerry Rosenberg, an
inmate at the Auburn Correctional Facility, stopped for about 90
seconds during surgery in Syracuse's University Hospital on Dec. 5,
1986, said attorney Richard Baumgarten.
   Rosenberg, a self-styled jailhouse lawyer, was denied parole
Wednesday for the fifth time since he became eligible for it in
1981. Rosenberg claims the parole board has no jurisdiction over
him because he had ``died,'' said Baumgarten, a spokesman for
Rosenberg.
   Baumgarten said he sent a letter to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
requesting a pardon, and if it is denied, Rosenberg will pursue the
case in federal court.
   ``He cannot be forced to serve a second life sentence,'' he said.
   Baumgarten said Rosenberg has documentation to support his
claim, but wouldn't say what it is.
   Dan Hurley, the Syracuse hospital's communications director,
said the state considers a person dead only after he is declared
brain dead by two physicians, one of them a neurosurgeon or a
neurologist.
   Although he couldn't reveal Rosenberg's files without his
physician's approval, he said Rosenberg's case ``certainly wasn't
death as we know it.''
   Rosenberg was sentenced to death in February 1963 after he was
convicted of killing two policemen during a robbery in Brooklyn.
The death sentence was reduced in 1965 to 20 years to life.
   Rosenberg, who says he has earned three law degrees through
correspondence courses, said he is not licensed as an attorney, but
is recognized in state and federal courts as a legal representative
in more than 250 cases. He said he has been accepting thousands of
dollars in legal fees from inmates and others for 15 years.
   However, state Department of Correction officials last year
found him guilty of illegally receiving $8,800 in fees from inmates
and sentenced him to a four-year term in a special housing unit of
the prison. They said he needed a license to collect fees.
   Rosenberg may, however, represent inmates if he asks the
permission of the prison superintendent and provides his services
for free, according to state prison regulations.
   Rosenberg could not be reached for comment because he is in
solitary confinement.

   A Soviet public relations expert studying U.S.
promotional strategies was left a little confused by American
commercials.
   ``Why is K mart America's favorite store?'' asked Valentin V.
Kozitzyn, here for a Soviet cultural exhibit.
   And another thing: why do Americans have to drink different
kinds of beer at different times of the day, he asked.
   Kozitsyn had seen the commercial asserting ``the night belongs
to Michelob.''
   He said the average Soviet probably knows more about American
culture than Soviet culture, and that part of solving that
shortcoming lies in modern p.r. techniques.
   ``There is much we need to teach our own people, and much to
learn about accomplishing that,'' Kozitsyn said.
   Kozitsyn sought answers to his questions on beer, K mart and
other topics from Smith Kaufman Public Relations here while
arranging a media tour to publicize the cultural exhibit.

   A man aboard a Pakistan International
Airlines jet fired two shots and wounded a security guard today
before being overpowered minutes before the aircraft landed near
the Afghan border, officials said.
   Karachi airport authorities said there were no other injuries
among the 143 passengers and 13 crew members aboard the A-300
Airbus. The jet, on a domestic flight from Karachi to Quetta,
landed safely.
   The incident occurred as the jet prepared to land at Quetta, a
city near the Afghanistan border in western Pakistan 375 miles
north of Karachi.
   The man entered the cockpit with a revolver and two security
guards tried to grab him, said the officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   A scuffle ensued in the first class cabin during which the man
discharged his gun twice, wounding one of the guards, according to
officials.
   They said the second guard managed to subdue the gunman.
   Officials said the gunman has not been identified and his motive
was unclear.
   Pakistan's national news agency, APP, reported that the gunman
also was injured, but airport officials could not immediately
confirm this.
   They could not explain either how the man was able to smuggle a
firearm aboard the plane.
   Airport security usually is extremely strict in Pakistan.
Passengers pass through two metal detectors and have their carry-on
luggage inspected at least three times before boarding a flight.

   A shotgun fired from a passing car blew out a
window of the Chinese Consulate in southwestern Japan, the latest
in a series of anti-Chinese incidents.
   Consul General Guo Chu and 15 other people were inside the
building when the shooting occurred Friday night, but no one was
hurt, officials said.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi told a news conference
today the incident was ``extremely unfortunate'' and expressed hope
it would not hurt Sino-Japanese relations.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry called in Zhao Zhongxin, counselor at
the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo, and expressed regret over the
incident in the name of Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno.
   An unidentified person in a car fired a shotgun at the Chinese
Consulate in Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo, at about 10:50
p.m., police said.
   The blast broke a window and damaged the ceiling and walls on
the first floor of the three-story building, said Takanobu
Kashiwagi, a Fukuoka police spokesman.
   Two nearby policemen guarding the building heard the shot and
saw a car speed away, Kashiwagi said.
   Investigators found an abandoned car about a mile from the
consulate this morning. Kashiwagi said the car had been stolen in
Fukuoka two days earlier.
   Relations between China and Japan have deteriorated in recent
years, with China criticizing Japan over its increased military
spending and angry over a Japanese court decision awarding a
disputed student dormitory in Kyoto to Taiwan.
   China says ownership of the dormitory, purchased by Taiwan in
1952, should be transferred to China because of Japan's switch of
diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1972.
   Some Japanese rightists have lashed out against the Chinese
criticism. Since last June, at least five monuments in different
parts of Japan dedicated to Sino-Japanese friendship have been
splattered with red paint. In September, a smoke bomb was hurled at
a wall at the Chinese Consulate in Osaka.

   An elderly couple who crashed to the dance floor
during a vigorous quickstep ended up in the High Court in London,
where a judge said their testimony had put him off dancing for life.
   ``Ballroom dancing is not normally a dangerous pastime. I'm
terrified now _ I shall never go near a ballroom again,'' said the
judge, Sir Leslie Boreham, 70, as he threw the case out Thursday.
   Dance teacher Edith Spry, 72, had sought damages from
70-year-old Jack Plowright. She testified during a five-hour
hearing that she asked Plowright for a dance during a 1981 vacation
on the Spanish island of Majorca.
   Mrs. Spry said Plowright ``whirled me round like I had never
been whirled round before,'' leaving her breathless, bruised and
flat on her back on the dance floor.
   ``He was dancing at a terrific speed. I was quite frightened. .
.. But before I could say anything I was on the floor,'' Mrs. Spry
testified.
   Mrs. Spry sued Plowright for unspecified damages, claiming he
kicked her left leg and caused an ulcer when he fell on her. She
blamed his fast-paced dancing on incorrect footwear _ plastic
sandals.
   Plowright denied dancing boisterously and said he overbalanced
when his feet stopped during a turn. He said the floor was uneven.
   The judge decided that Plowright did not dance with reckless
abandon and dismissed the case.

<HEAD>Prince Charles: Ski Party Was Aware of Avalanche Dangers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS graf at bottom with funeral arrangements</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles said a roaring avalanche that
missed him in the Swiss Alps took only seconds to bury two skiing
partners, killing one. He said his skiing party was aware of the
dangers when they left the main trails.
   The Hon. Audrey Lindsay, mother of the dead skier, Maj. Hugh
Lindsay, was quoted today by the British domestic news agency Press
Association as telling a relative: ``I don't blame anybody. It was
an unfortunate accident.''
   Looking distraught and wearing black, Charles, his wife,
Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the Duchess of York,
returned home Friday from Switzerland.
   Their plane, which landed at Northolt air base near London,
carried the coffin containing the body of the 34-year-old Lindsay,
a former aide to Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and a close
friend of Charles and Diana.
   They were met at the base by Lindsay's widow, Sarah Lindsay, who
is expecting a baby in May. Mrs. Lindsay, a Buckingham Palace press
officer, had helped answer questions about the avalanche before
discovering her husband was killed in it.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at Zurich airport
after the royal party left for England, Charles, the heir to the
British throne, said:
   ``All members of my party were skiing off the piste (the regular
ski runs) at own our risk and we all accepted ... that mountains
have to be treated with the greatest respect and not treated
lightly,'' he said.
   He said that when the avalanche Thursday at Klosters,
Switzerland, started ``with a tremendous roaring'' he and three
others in the group skied out its path. The other two, Lindsay and
Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson could not evade the snow slide.
   ``To my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson just
failed to ski clear and were swept away in a whirling maelstrom as
the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us to the valley
below,'' the prince said. ``It was all over in a terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   Charles described how he helped dig Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson out of
the snow with a shovel and then with his hands. She broke both legs
and is in a Swiss hospital.
   The 39-year-old prince has been skiing for more than 15 years
and knows the area well where the avalanche occurred. He was
leading the ski party and Press Association quoted police at
Klosters as saying he personally asked Thursday for the party to be
allowed to ski on the perilous slopes where the avalanche later
occurred.
   Charles was praised for helping save the life of Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson. But some British newspapers called him foolhardy
for taking on the dangerous Haglamatte slopes of Klosters.
   Mrs. Lindsay was at Northolt to see six soldiers from her late
husband's Royal Lancers regiment carry his flag-draped coffin from
the red and white jet of the Queen's Flight.
   She left afterwards with her father while Charles went to
Windsor Castle 20 miles away to see the queen. Diana and Sarah left
in another car for Kensington Palace in London.
   ``Their movements for the weekend are private,'' Buckingham
Palace said.
   Lindsay's funeral is expected to take place at the Royal
Military College at Sandhurst on Thursday, provided legal matters
are settled in time, his regiment, the 9th@12th Royal Lancers said
today. The service in the Memorial Chapel will be followed by a
cremation.

   Dennis Day, a singer who served as
comic foil for Jack Benny on television and radio shows, was
hospitalized in critical condition today with a brain injury, an
official said.
   ``He's showing signs of improvement day by day, and we're taking
it day by day,'' publicist Kitty Davis said Friday. ``He's showing
signs of response.''
   Day, 71, a tenor known for his recordings of Irish ballads such
as ``Danny Boy,'' was diagnosed last July as having amyotropic
lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The
progressive nerve disorder causes a loss in muscle control.
   But Day wasn't hospitalized until he fell and hit his head at
his Bel Air-area home Wednesday, said Armen Markarian, spokesman
for St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   His condition was critical early today, and he remained under
close observation, according to a nursing supervisor.
   Day complained of a severe headache while he was being examined
in the hospital emergency room early Wednesday, Markarian said.
Tests showed bleeding in the brain and he was taken to surgery,
Markarian said.
   ``He's been in critical condition since then,'' the spokesman
added.
   Day was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City. His singing
career began in 1939 as a naive kid with a golden voice on Jack
Benny's radio show.
   One of his trademark lines was a sprightly ``Gee, Mr. Benny!''
   He recorded a number of songs, such as ``Peg of My Heart'' and
``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and he also appeared in several films,
including ``Buck Benny Rides Again,'' ``Music in Manhattan,'' ``One
Sunday Afternoon'' and ``The Girl Next Door.''
   During a vacation in Hawaii last year, Day became aware of a
muscle-control problem and returned to the Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla, where doctors diagnosed Lou Gehrig's disease.
   He was confined to a wheelchair during recent months, Ms. Davis
said, but he made regular appearances at Irish fairs and benefits
for medical research.

   A train inspector who tampered with the breaks of
a train because his relatives were refused seats has been sentenced
to eight years in prison, China's official Xinhua News Agency said
today.
   The report said a court in Lanzhou, northwest China, found Wang
Gang guilty of sabotage in dismantling six brake shoes on a
passenger train traveling from Urumqi to Zhenzhou on Jan. 18.
   It said Wang, an inspector at Yumen City in Gansu province,
became angered when he asked an attendant working on the train to
find two berths for his relatives and was told there were no
available seats.
   The faulty brakes were discovered after the train left the
station. They were replaced at the next station, the report said.
   China has been plagued this year by disasters on its overcrowded
railway system, with 34 people killed in a compartment fire, 19
killed in a head-on collision and 88 killed in a train derailment.
All three accidents occurred in January.
   The head-on collision, in northeast China's Heilongjiang
province, was blamed on sabotage, although there have been no
reported arrests.
   Railways Minister Ding Guangen resigned last week to take
responsibility for the accidents.

   Colossus, reputed to be the largest
lowland gorilla in captivity, is moving from frosty New Hampshire
to a spacious new home in Florida, where he'll get to enjoy the
sunshine and perhaps a little romance.
   The 600-pound gorilla is to fly in a chartered DC-3 Sunday from
Benson's Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., to nearby Pensacola. He'll
then be trucked to The Zoo, about 10 miles east of Gulf Breeze,
said Pat Quinn, president and director of the park.
   Colossus was captured as an infant 20 years ago in Africa and
has not seen another gorilla since then, but Quinn said he hopes to
introduce him to females of his species and breed him.
   ``We hope to socialize him so he will breed naturally with
females,'' Quinn said.
   The socialization process is to start by letting Colossus see,
smell and touch a male chimpanzee. Then he would be introduced to
another bachelor male gorilla or a infertile female, Quinn said.
   An initial attempt at breeding may be through artificial
insemination, and one potential recipient is Koko, the signing,
cat-loving gorilla owned by the Gorilla Foundation in Woodside,
Calif.
   Semen will be obtained from Colossus before he is moved and then
frozen.
   ``We are hoping to obtain some of that for use with Koko because
she is very anxious to become a mother,'' said Penny Patterson,
director of the Gorilla Foundation.
   Ms. Patterson said 16-year-old Koko's keepers know she wants to
have a baby because she has told them so through sign language.
That skill and her doting care of a pet kitten landed Koko on the
cover of National Geographic magazine.
   All Ball, so named by Koko because it was a tailless manx, was
hit by a truck and killed after the National Geographic story, but
Koko was given a replacement kitten named Smokey, now an adult cat
still living with her.
   Koko and a male gorilla, Michael, communicate with sign language
to express their feelings, ask for food and certain teachers and
inquire about other animals.
   Colossus' sperm may be used because captive gorillas sometimes
develop incest taboos against cage mates, so Michael would be
unsuitable, Ms. Patterson said.Another advantage is that Colossus
was captured in the wild as an infant and isn't inbred with zoo
gorillas.

   The bodies of three IRA
guerrillas killed by British troops in Gibraltar will be flown to
Dublin Monday on a chartered plane, the IRA's political wing Sinn
Fein said today.
   Police said Friday night they will move in to stop any IRA
paramilitary display at the funerals and asked the families for a
public promise that there would be no such display. There was no
immediate reaction from the families.
   Last Sunday's killing of the three unarmed Irish Republican Army
guerrillas sparked nighttime rioting in Belfast much of the week.
Authorities have said the guerrillas were plotting a huge car bomb
explosion in the British colony of Gibraltar, on Spain's southern
tip.
   The Irish government had complained that there was no attempt to
arrest the guerrillas before they were shot.
   A Sinn Fein statement said Spanish customs had refused ``to
accommodate the return'' of the bodies of Mairead Farrell, 31,
Daniel McCann, 30, and Sean Savage, 24, on the first available
scheduled flight to Dublin.
   As a result, it said, the bodies will be put aboard a chartered
plane which will fly directly from Gibraltar to Dublin, from where
they will be taken to Belfast, in the British province.
   Spanish Customs spokesman Julio Verdu in La Linea de la
Concepcion, which borders Gibraltar, said today ``it is absolutely
false'' that the Spanish government had refused entry into Spain of
the three bodies.
   Verdu said Health Ministry officials had stayed on the job
overtime Friday night in case the families decided to transport the
bodies to Malaga.
   The bodies have been kept at the Gibraltar Royal Naval Hospital
while attempts have been made to find a way to return them to
Ireland.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA has been fighting to unite the
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   No date has been set for the funerals, but Sinn Fein sources in
Belfast have been hinting they may be held next Thursday, St.
Patrick's Day.
   IRA funerals in Northern Ireland have seen repeated violence as
angry crowds clashed with police trying to stop paramilitary IRA
members from firing over the coffin.
   Police say the ceremonial gunfire represents an illegal show of
arms. But despite their presence in force, paramilitaries shielded
by crowds of thousands often have managed to fire the traditional
salute.

   More than 80 people were killed and
hundreds were injured today when soccer fans were trampled in a
stampede to get out of a hailstorm, eyewitnesses and hospital
sources said.
   The storm pelted about 30,000 fans with hailstones during a
match between a Nepalese and Bangladeshi team at the National
Stadium.
   Fans rushed to stadium exits but found them locked, witnesses
said.
   Hospital sources confirmed 60 dead and more than 250 injured,
many of them in critical condition. Witnesses said there were more
than 20 bodies left at the stadium that were not taken to hospitals.
   None of the athletes was involved in the stampede, they said.
   Strong winds accompanied the storm, uprooting trees in Katmandu
Valley, surrounding the capital.

<TEXT>
   Bill Britt, the ``hermit of Chestnut Hill''
whose refusal to leave his makeshift home in the woods cost him his
life, was remembered at his funeral as a colorful, articulate
``free spirit.''
   Fifty relatives and friends packed the funeral home Friday to
pay tribute to the garrulous, 52-year-old eccentric whose body was
found Monday in his lean-to at the Chestnut Hill cemetery.
Authorities said he had frozen to death about two weeks before.
   The funeral also attracted the media, and the room was lit up
with television lights, a touch which Britt's son said his father
would have enjoyed.
   ``My father would have loved this. He's got all the cameras
here,'' Britton Steven Boughner, 30, said.
   But if his father loved attention, he also cherished
independence. Said his son: ``He was a free spirit and he (taught)
me not to be afraid of anything or any individual.''
   Britt's daughter, Ingrid Boughner, 28, wept talking about the
father who was reunited with two of his three children only a year
ago.
   ``My father never really was a hermit,'' she said. ``He was a
naturalist. ... He was the most colorful and articulate human
being.''
   Britt's friend of two decades, birth control activist Bill
Baird, recalled Britt's ``passion for freedom, independence and the
beauty of the woods.''
   Also at the service were Britt's mother, Marion, 86, his two
brothers, and close friends like Sophie ``Bubbles'' Haggett. Ms.
Haggett spoke to Britt daily by telephone from her home in Malden
and would bring him soup and clothing. Britt died while the
70-year-old woman was laid up in the hospital.
   Britt's body was cremated. His ashes were to be scattered today
in the woods where he had lived.
   Britt was once an ordinary married man with three children and a
job in an office. All that changed after a painful divorce in 1969.
   Soon he cast off his three-piece suits and his three-piece name,
Britton William Boughner. He began to retreat to the woods at the
state-owned Chestnut Hill reservoir, near the affluent suburb of
the same name where he was born.
   But the ``hermit of Chestnut Hill'' was hardly a recluse. He was
shrewd, witty and stubborn, given freely to tears. He would ride
the trolleys and hunt for pay phones to call reporters, clad in
cast-off clothing and dragging an armful of plastic buckets.
   Bear-shaped and nearly toothless, Britt had blind eyes swollen
with infection. He refused welfare and lived on the nickels he got
for empty bottles and cans.
   Two years ago, officials began trying to force Britt to leave
the state land.
   Britt fought back. He showed the world a misunderstood hermit
who wanted only to be left among the trees. It landed him on ``Late
Night with David Letterman.'' Actor Mickey Rooney suggested a TV
movie about his life.
   A sympathetic judge respected Britt's wish for a suburban Eden
and ordered the state to find a suitable alternative site.
   Britt refused them all. But last July, he was finally ejected
from state land and moved to the adjacent cemetery.

   The Chicago Sun-Times editorial board says the
newspaper will endorse Vice President George Bush for the
Republican presidential nomination and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis as the best choice for Democrats.
   The board, in a statement released before formal editorial
endorsements are published Sunday, praised Bush's ``variety and
texture of public experience'' and said Dukakis would give his
party the best chance of regaining the White House.
   The rival Chicago Tribune on Friday endorsed Sen. Robert Dole
for the GOP nomination but has taken no stand on the Democratic
race in Tuesday's primary. The Tribune said Dole has at times been
``the lone Republican voice of reason and good sense on matters of
budget and foreign affairs.''
   ``We urge Illinois Republicans to give enthusiastic validation
to the Bush candidacy,'' the Sun-Times editorial board said in a
statement issued Friday.
   The editors cited Bush's past experience as a congressman, CIA
director, United Nations ambassador, national party chairman as
well as his current position as vice president.
   ``Rarely has a presidential candidate offered the variety and
texture of public experience that Mr. Bush represents,'' the
editorial board said.
   ``Mr. Bush has more inside knowledge of the workings of more
aspects of government than all but a few candidates in two
centuries,'' the newspaper's editors said.
   ``We have supreme confidence in Mr. Bush's understanding of
international affairs and his capability for stewardship in guiding
the United States through the mine fields of world politics,'' the
editors said.
   In their Democratic endorsement, the editors said, ``On balance,
we consider Governor Dukakis the best Democratic choice to grapple
with and attempt to master the awesome powers of the presidency.''
   ``There is no question _ no question at all _ of Mr. Dukakis'
skills, talent, fiscal prudence and sound instincts administering a
large bureaucracy,'' the newspaper's editorial board said.
   ``We also believe he represents the party's strongest contender
to regain the White House.''

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a Palestinian
who threw a hand grenade, and prison officials opened fire on
protesters who pelted their bus with stones, wounding one woman,
the army command said today.
   Bethlehem's Mayor Elias Freij told The Associated Press about
300 Palestinian policemen have handed in their resignations,
including all 50 officers in Bethlehem.
   An army spokesman said the hand grenade did not explode.
Soldiers chased the assailant and shot him in the back. He was
taken to Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, but a hospital official
said he had no details about the man's condition.
   The incident took place Friday evening in the village of Bani
Naim, near Hebron in the occupied West Bank. It was the second time
Palestinians have thrown hand grenades at Israeli troops since
violence broke out three months ago.
   Today, prison service employees opened fire on protesters who
pelted their bus with stones and broke several windows in the West
Bank village of Nur el-Shams, the army spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A 50-year-old woman was wounded and taken to a hospital, the
spokesman said.
   In Bethlehem, soldiers dispersed two demonstrations and arrested
several protesters who threw stones and empty bottles at the local
police station.
   Freij said the resignation of the local police ``would make
things very difficult. There was a theft in town about a week ago.
Our policemen found the thieves and put them in jail within 12
hours. Who will do this now?''
   Freij said all the police in Ramallah and Jericho resigned. The
Arab-run Palestine Press Service said 68 policemen in Hebron also
quit. The resignations go into effect Monday, Freij said.
   On Friday, the army barred Palestinian worshipers from three
mosques in Gaza City on the Moslem holy day in an attempt to
maintain order. Israeli soldiers wounded nine worshipers after
services in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Troops razed four Palestinian homes to punish suspects in the
attempted lynching of a collaborator and the knifing of a Jewish
settler.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir attacked the latest U.S. peace
plan and said it was formulated to please the Arabs. The PLO has
also rejected the plan because it did not provide for direct
Palestinian representation at negotiations.
   Troops were posted Friday around Al Amari mosque in Gaza and
barbed wire blocked the street to keep out worshipers. Gaza's main
mosque draws about 2,500 faithful, and local residents said it was
the first time it was closed.
   Two other mosques in Gaza City also were shut by the army to
prevent demonstrations, which have become routine on Fridays since
violence broke out Dec. 8 in the territories seized by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israeli bullets or beatings have killed 87 Palestinians in
anti-occupation rioting.
   The army turned journalists away from Nablus and Hebron but the
clampdown was not as widespread as the previous Friday, when nearly
all the West Bank was closed to coverage.
   In Beit Ummar, 10 miles south of Jerusalem, troops shot and
wounded eight Palestinians, two of them seriously, hospital
officials at Beit Jallah and Mukassed said.
   Soldiers fired tear gas canisters to disperse protesters outside
the Beit Ummar mosque. Witnesses said at one point troops entered
the building to broadcast a message over the loudspeaker ordering
protesters to go home.
   ``The soldiers entered the mosque while we were still kneeling
barefoot on our prayer rugs. People started shouting Allahu
Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' said Youssef Hassan Khalil, 30, who
lay on a cot in Mukassed hospital with a wounded right ankle.
   In Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City, soldiers fired on
demonstrators outside a mosque, wounding one Palestinian in the
leg, officials at Shifa hospital said.
   Israeli troops destroyed one Palestinian home in Hebron and
three in Biddya village, 30 miles west of Jerusalem.
   The army command said the homes in Biddya belonged to families
of three residents who led a lynching attempt March 5 against a man
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   Shamir broke his silence two days before flying to Washington
and criticized the peace initiative proposed by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz.
   ``The only word I agree with in the U.S. plan is the name
Shultz,'' Shamir was quoted as saying in an interview with the
daily Haaretz.
   The PLO has said that it would not agree to indirect
representation through a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation as
suggested in the Shultz plan.

<HEAD>Illinois Farmer Returns to Nicaragua, Where He Was Held Prisoner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American farmer who was held prisoner 54
days in Nicaragua has received a polite welcome back in that
nation, but cannot return to his farm in Costa Rica, according to a
published report.
   James Denby, who was shot down over Nicaragua on Dec. 6, has
returned to Managua to retrieve his damaged private plane and
review his legal status there, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
   Although he was accused of being a spy and CIA informant while
being held by the Sandinistas, he has become something of a
celebrity upon his return to Managua, the newspaper said.
Nicaraguan soldiers reportedly have been seen asking for his
autograph.
   ``I didn't know I'd done anything to become a public
personality,'' Denby told the newspaper Thursday. ``I've been a
little amazed. It seems unusual for a soldier to come up to me and
ask for an autograph after being in prison for two months.''
   Denby, of Carlinville, Ill., was freed Jan. 31 after Bill Press,
a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate from California, persuaded
the Nicaraguan government to release Denby before a congressional
vote on aid to the Contra rebels.
   After his release, Denby delivered a message in Washington D.C.
against Contra aid, although the lifelong Republican later said he
had supported the Contras while farming in Central America.
   Denby said he returned to Managua to get documentation that the
Nicaraguan government no longer has any charges against him, and
expects to receive it.
   But he told the newspaper he still has some problems to solve,
including settling a bill for $3,000 from the Nicaraguan government
for towing his Cessna 172 from the Costa Rican border, where it was
shot down.
   Ironically, Denby was refused entry to Costa Rica when he tried
to return to his farm, and Costa Rican officials told him they had
not been notified of any change in his legal status by Nicaragua.
   ``In fact, I got deported to Panama right when things got bad
with (Panamanian military strongman Manuel Antonio) Noriega,''
Denby told the newspaper. ``I didn't think that was the proper
place to be.''
   As a result, Denby is staying on in Nicaragua.

   ``There is no question _ no question at all _ of Mr. Dukakis'
skills, talent, fiscal prudence and sound instincts administering a
large bureaucracy,'' the newspaper's editorial board said.
   ``We also believe he represents the party's strongest contender
to regain the White House.''

   The National Association of Evangelicals is
concerned about the effect of financial and sexual wrongdoings by
television preachers on young people, marriages and moral
principles.
   ``We express ... deep disappointment and sorrow over some recent
highly publicized moral lapses,'' the NAE leadership said in a
statement at its conference this week.
   All of those interviewed were quick to agree that the recent
confession of sexual episodes by Jimmy Swaggart and the earlier
allegations of sexual and financial wrongdoing by Jim Bakker were
exceptional cases. But they worried about the aftereffects.
   Jeffrey K. Hadden, professor of sociology at the University of
Virginia, said the repercussions from the recent scandals that have
plagued the industry are numerous.
   ``There will be more investigations,'' Hadden said. ``There are
a lot of people around who would like to get these guys. It's sort
of open season.''
   He noted that a House subcommittee was looking into possible
violations of postal regulations governing direct-mail
solicitations and said the Internal Revenue Service and Federal
Communications Commission would probably uncover other wrongdoings.
   There was also concern among members of the National Religious
Broadcasters, an affiliate of the NAE, about reports of an increase
in the number of television stations dropping religious programming
as a result of the Swaggart case.
   Gerry Leonard of Orlando, central Florida coordinator of a
teaching ministry called Evangelism Explosion, said she gets many
questions from people concerned about television evangelism.
   ``We don't throw stones or put anybody down because these are
events caused by individuals, not the church,'' she said. ``But I
tell them to carefully study what the Bible teaches, not what
somebody represents it to be.''
   ``These TV preachers have to answer for their own sins,'' said
Milton Russ, who runs an agency that aids churches in their
fund-raising activities. ``We make sure that what we're doing is
right. ... They should too.''
   He said that those who avidly follow and give their financial
support to TV ministries ``have no real strong ties to local
churches. They just do not personally want to get involved. ...
Whenever one of them (TV preachers) gets in trouble, they just
switch channels and go on to the other guy.''

   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis are bidding to score political knockouts in Illinois
against dogged opponents who refuse to give up their presidential
campaigns despite long odds.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, acknowledging that ``we're hanging by our
fingernails,'' announced Friday he has purchased 30 minutes of
television time tonight and he challenged Bush to join him ``to
discuss the issues.''
   The vice president rejected a one-on-one debate with Dole.
   ``That ploy has been used before,'' he said during an appearance
before the Illinois Farm Bureau. ``I may have used it before when
things weren't going too well. But debates are cruel and unusual
punishment. We've already had seven of them.''
   During an appearance at the University of Illinois, Dukakis told
reporters that if he can beat Sen. Paul Simon on the senator's home
ground ``it would be a turning point'' in the Democratic
presidential race.
   A smiling Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, took time out from heavy
campaigning to feast on flaming saganaki, or fried cheese, and
squid at the Greek Islands restaurant in Chicago's ``Greektown''
section. The candidate scheduled no speech there but stopped often
to shake hands with others dining at the restaurant.
   Dukakis, whose parents were natives of Greece, said he is not
trying to build an ethnic coalition.
   ``We want to put together a coalition of people all over this
country, whether they're first-generation or second-generation
Americans,'' he said.
   The Chicago Sun-Times editorial board announced it would endorse
Bush and Dukakis in Sunday's editions. The board praised Bush's
``variety and texture of public experience'' and said Dukakis is
his party's strongest contender to regain th White House.
   The rival Chicago Tribune on Friday endorsed Dole, saying he has
often been ``the lone Republican voice of reason and good sense on
matters of budget and foreign affairs.'' The Tribune had made no
endorsement in the Democratic race.
   As expected, Gary Hart announced his departure from the
Democratic race on Friday. ``I got a fair hearing and the people
decided,'' said the former Colorado senator.
   Jesse Jackson was the winner of a non-binding straw vote taken
Thursday night during Alaska's Democratic caucuses. Jackson
received 35 percent of the vote to 30 percent for Dukakis, the
state party announced Friday.
   Jackson campaigned Friday in South Carolina which holds
Democratic caucuses today and he was given a strong chance of
winning a majority of the delegates in his native state. His
principal competition in the state came from Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   Simon insisted he would carry Illinois in Tuesday's presidential
primary and that no candidate would have a first-ballot nomination
at the Democratic National Convention next July.
   ``I think I have as good a chance as anyone,'' said Simon, as he
campaigned in the Chicago area.
   Simon said he believed that New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's
statement that he would endorse a Democratic presidential candidate
before his state's presidential primary on April 19 meant that
Cuomo is waiting for the results of the Illinois primary.
   However, Simon could take less encouragement from a Cuomo
statement on Friday when the governor said he thought the Democrats
ought to unite behind whichever candidate has the most delegates at
the end of the primary season.
   ``If Mike Dukakis has 41 percent, get everybody together in a
room and say, `Jesse, Gore, Gephardt, you came close, but Mike's
the candidate,''' said Cuomo. ``Let's pick the guy who's ahead
after California.''
   Campaigning around the state, Dole conceded that ``we're hanging
by our fingernails. We shouldn't be but we are. We need to somehow
capture the attention of the Illinois voters.''
   In an effort to accomplish that, the Dole campaign has spent
$100,000 to buy 30 minutes on Chicago television station WGN for a
live broadcast from Knox College in Galesburg which was the site of
one of the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas.
   Dole refused to discuss the format for the broadcast except to
say, ``I'll be there.''
   ``I know he's ahead,'' Dole said of Bush. ``He knows he's
ahead.''
   He said, ``The voters of Illinois can make history Tuesday be
demanding that we discuss the issues.''
   Bush also will be in Galesburg and Dole was asked if he might
personally confront the vice president in an effort to engage him
in debate.
   ``I doubt it,'' he said. ``No gimmicks, no games.''

   At least 57 people were killed when a
cyclone hit the central coastal city of Quelimane earlier this
month, the national news agency AIM reported today.
   Cyclone Filao struck March 1 and damaged large parts of
Quelimane and surrounding rural areas, AIM reported. The word
cyclone is used in the Indian Ocean area to describe a hurricane.
   The deaths have not been reported previously due to poor
communications links, AIM said. The news agency said the death toll
may rise when information from surrounding areas becomes available.
   The cyclone destroyed 800 homes in Quelimane and neighboring
areas, leaving an estimated 4,000 people homeless, AIM said. Local
rice fields were damagaed and a government warehouse containing
food supplies was destroyed, AIM said.
   Large trees and telephone poles were ripped from the ground, and
parts of the city of about 75,000 remain without electricity, the
news agency said.
   Eduardo Joao, planning director for Zambezia province, estimated
the damage to buildings at just under $1 million.

   Firefighters had to force about 100 patrons at a
midtown Manhattan nightspot to leave the building after a fire
broke out in the back of the Club Oasis early today, a spokesman
said.
   ``They didn't want to leave the disco,'' said Fire Lt. Frank
Martinez.
   The fire, reported at 12:12 a.m. by residents in apartments
above the basement club, was declared under control around 3 a.m.,
Martinez said.
   Thirteen firefighters reported minor injuries, including a fire
captain who went to Lenox Hill Hospital with a cut head after he
fell in the basement of a nearby shop while battling the blaze,
Martinez said.
   Two people believed to be apartment residents were also sent to
hospitals, an elderly woman complaining of chest pains and another
woman suffering smoke inhalation, he said.
   About 100 firefighters were at the scene. The club runs under
three five-story buildings with about eight businesses and 30
apartments overhead, Martinez said.
   Some of the residents may not be allowed back into their
apartments until the units can be checked for possible structural
damage, Martinez said, adding that the Red Cross had relocated the
75 people.
   The department said after a preliminary investigation that the
fire had started in some rubbish in an alleyway behind the disco.

   The administration has reluctantly ordered the
closing of the PLO observer mission at the United Nations because
of a law Secretary of State George P. Shultz called ``one of the
dumber things that Congress has done lately.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III gave the Palestine Liberation
Organization mission in New York until March 21 to close, saying
the department would then go to federal court to enforce the
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987.
   The 1947 treaty under which New York became U.N. headquarters
obliges the United States to let all accredited missions operate,
U.N. officials and the State Department have said.
   Despite the headquarters treaty, Congress passed the law
ordering the mission closed and President Reagan signed it into law
last Dec. 22 as part of a State Department spending bill. Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., who played a leading role in the congressional
debate, called the PLO ``the world's most vicious terrorist
organization.''
   The State Department earlier had closed the PLO's information
office in Washington but opposed the law that would close its UN
office.
   ``For more than a century ... the Supreme Court has held that
Congress has the authority to abrogate treaties and international
law for the purpose of domestic law,'' Assistant Attorney General
Charles Cooper, head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal
Counsel, said Friday at a news conference. He said the Justice
Department is obliged to follow the congressional decision.
   Calling the law ``one of the dumber things that the Congress has
done lately,'' Shultz added:
   ``The administration opposed that law. And my opinion remains
that it is a very bad piece of legislation ... and the net result
of it is, from the standpoint of those who don't like the PLO _ and
I don't like the PLO _ but from the standpoint of those don't like
the PLO, what have they done?
   ``They've glorified the PLO and they've given legitimacy to the
PLO.''
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
``strongly protested this violation of the headquarters agreement''
during a Friday morning meeting he had with Herbert Okun, deputy
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani.
   The secretary-general's legal staff is ``studying options,'' but
Giuliani refused to describe them or say if the United Nations
would join litigation on behalf of the PLO.
   Okun, in a letter to Perez de Cuellar, said the United States
refuses binding arbitration of the dispute over the mission in the
worst confrontation ever between the United Nations and its host
country.
   Cooper said the statute ``has superseded the requirements of the
U.N. headquarters agreement'' and that participation in an
international tribunal ``would be to no useful end.''
   The 159-nation General Assembly, in a special meeting last
month, asked the World Court in the Hague to rule on whether the
United States must agree to arbitration. Oral arguments are
scheduled for April 11.
   The Arab League's permanent observer at the United Nations,
Clovis Maksoud, said that if the United States presses to close the
mission, ``naturally one of the options would be ... that the 43rd
session of the (U.N.) general assembly would have to meet
elsewhere.''
   Several Arab diplomats have suggested that the General Assembly
move to Geneva if the mission in New York is closed.
   ``The call by all members of the U.N., Israel being the only
obvious exception, for the U.S. to abide by its treaty obligations,
was not heeded, and with the attorney general's decision the
international consensus was brushed aside,'' Maksoud said.
   The United States and Israel consider the PLO a terrorist
organization. But the United Nations recognizes it as the only
legitimate spokesman for Palestinians.

   The European Space Agency fired its
first Ariane 3 rocket into space this year in a flawless launch
that carried two telecommunications satellites _ one American and
one French _ into orbit.
   Officials called the launch Friday night of the West's only
active commercial satellite launcher ``a complete success,'' with
all operations perfect. It was Ariane's 21st launching and the
first of eight planned for this year.
   The Ariane 3 placed into orbit France's Telecom 1C and the
American Spacenet IIIR-Geostar, which includes facilities for The
Associated Press.
   Technicians said the two satellites, placed into orbit by Ariane
above the equator, obtained an altitude of 22,554 miles.
   The critical day for the Spacenet satellite is Wednesday, when
its own motor ignites to place it into its definitive orbit 87
degrees west above the equator.
   Liftoff from the space agency's jungle base on the northern
coast of South America came at 8:28 p.m. local time (6:28 p.m. EST).
   The third-stage engine, at fault in three of Ariane's four
failed launchings, ignited normally four minutes after blastoff,
officials said. Twenty minutes after blastoff, the rocket separated
from its payload, thrusting the two satellites into geostationary
transfer orbits.
   Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, the European Space
Agency's commercial arm, immediately announced plans for launches
on May 11 and at the end of May. One would be a demonstration of
the more powerful Ariane 4 rocket, described by ESA as ``the new
generation of the European launcher.''
   ``This success enables us to envision the ambitious program of
eight launches a year,'' d'Allest said after the launch. ``For
that, vigilance and rigorousness are needed.''
   Some experts estimate the commercial space market will be worth
more than $1 billion per year after 1991.
   Including Friday's payload, Arianespace has 43 satellites on its
order books worth $2.36 billion, according to the company.
   To keep up with the orders, the Kourou space center has made two
launch pads available.
   The launch Friday was first scheduled for December but was
delayed for extra tests after abnormalities were detected in the
oxygen and liquid hydrogen third-stage engine.
   ``We preferred to take the time to understand the problem,''
said d'Allest.
   Third-stage engine failure was the cause of failed Ariane
launches in September 1982, September 1985 and May 1986. The last
failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded for more than a
year.
   Another failed launch occurred in May 1980 because of a problem
with the first-stage engine.
   The 21st launch thrust into orbit the American GTE Spacenet
Corp.'s fifth satellite, Spacenet III R-Geostar R01. The satellite
is aimed at increasing the company's telecommunications services in
the United States and helping set up a system of satellite
communication with mobile units such as trucks, cars and trains.
   The satellite, with an expected lifetime of 10 years, weighed
2,674 pounds before liftoff and 1,562 pounds in orbit.
   GTE Spacenet lost a satellite in the 1985 failed launch.
   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by the AP are to
provide the New York-based news cooperative with domestic satellite
delivery services over the next 10 years. A satellite being used is
nearing the end of its operational service.
   The French Telecom IC, the third in a series of satellites owned
by France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications system. It is
to replace Telecom 1-B, which broke down Jan. 15.
   With the U.S. space shuttle grounded and America's Titan 4 and
Delta rockets not yet competitive, Ariane remains the only active
launcher for commercial satellites in the West.

   A major blizzard continued its slow march east across the
northern Plains today, stranding travelers and schoolchildren,
forcing authorities to close interstate highways and causing scores
of minor accidents.
   Snow combined with winds of 30 to 50 mph produced limited
visibility and drifts up to 10 feet deep from northeast Colorado
and southeast Wyoming into northern and western Minnesota.
   ``There's zero visibility. We're just advising people not to
travel right now,'' said Polk County, Minn., sheriff's dispatcher
Bob Janorschke.
   Conditions were so bad by 9 p.m. Friday that even snow plows
were pulled off roads in parts of Minnesota, the state
Transportation Department said.
   Wyoming state offices were closed Friday, although the
Legislature met. North Dakota Capitol workers were sent home about
an hour after they arrived.
   Blizzard warnings remained in effect today for much of the
eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota, and winter storm warnings or
winter storm watches were issued for sections of Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan.
   In Chadron, Neb., 31 inches of snow fell, with snow drifts 5
feet deep. Up to 40 inches of snow fell in two days in the
mountains of Utah at the Alta ski resort, with 37 inches at
Snowbird. Three to 4 feet fell around Lead and Deadwood on the
edges of South Dakota's Black Hills. Visibility in many areas was
down to zero.
   In western Nebraska, school bus driver Linda Barret and her 13
riders took refuge Thursday at a farm some 20 miles from Harrisburg
when the storm cut visibility, and bus driver Sharon Grubbs and her
eight riders, ages 7 to 13, wound up at a farm 17 miles from the
town.
   ``It looks as if the children will be snowed in at least until
this morning,'' Mrs. Barrett said Friday night.
   Power has been out at the second farm, owned by Jack and Karen
Holt, since late Thursday, cutting off the heat.
   ``You can see your breath in the house,'' said one of the
stranded youngsters, 14-year-old Jeff Rundell.
   Ms. Grubbs said the house was holding the heat to about 40
degrees.
   In the Nebraska Panhandle, Kimball Civil Defense Director Dan
Jenson estimated 600 stranded travelers spent Friday night in the
town of 3,800 residents. Many stayed with townspeople, Jenson said.
   Outside Scottsbluff, Neb., Jim and Elizabeth Davis of Hot
Springs, Wyo., spent about 15 hours stuck in their car before being
rescued Friday. Davis, 68, said he and his 67-year-old wife had
apples and candy, plenty of blankets and a full gas tank.
   Winds gusting to 69 mph were reported Friday at Akron, Colo.,
and to 67 mph at Fort Morgan, Colo., while gusts over 50 mph were
clocked at Rapid City, S.D.; Scottsbluff, Neb.; and Duluth, Minn.
   The wind blew off a 20-by-30 foot section of roof at a Rapid
City hotel, and it landed on three cars. No one was hurt.
   The weather threatened thousands of newborn calves, and ranchers
in the Nebraska Sandhills region worked around the clock to get
animals to shelter.
   ``We had 300 calves born yesterday. We're dragging them in,
separating them from their mothers,'' said Marianne Beel.
   The storm could cause severe losses to South Dakota's cattle
industry. Dick Kjerstad, chairman of the state Beef Checkoff
Campaign Committee said Friday.
   Interstate 80 was closed for more than 300 miles, from Walcott,
Wyo., to Big Springs, Neb., because of snowdrifts and low
visibility. Almost 140 miles of Interstate 25 were closed in
Wyoming, more than 200 miles of Interstate 90 in South Dakota, and
parts of Interstates 25 and 70 in Colorado. A 200-mile section of
I-94 in North Dakota, closed Friday afternoon, was reopened this
morning.

   Border guards rescued 88 men, women and
children from traffickers who were trying to smuggle them out for
prostitution and indentured servitude abroad, officials and
newspapers said Saturday.
   Young girls were lured away from school by women who told them
their mothers were ill and offered to take them home, the
government-owned Dainik Bangla and other newspapers reported.
   A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said hundreds of women had been smuggled across the border in
recent years.
   ``Most of these women land up in brothels, either in India or in
Pakistan,'' he said.
   In some cases, people have paid smugglers who promised them an
escape from Bangladesh's grinding poverty, according to newspapers.
The smugglers, known as ``manpower agents,'' promise jobs as
servants and manual laborers in prosperous Middle Eastern nations.
   Often the victims end up as nothing more than slaves in
households or on farms.
   Maj. Noor, a battalion commander of the Bangladesh Rifles border
guards, said a new alert was declared Monday at the border between
Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal in an effort to stop
the smuggling.
   ``We have recovered at least 80 women and children and some
accompanying men since the latest crackdown started on March 7,''
Noor said when contacted by telephone at border town of Rajshahi.
   He said the group included 28 women, 31 children and 29 men.
   Dhaka newspapers said 200 women and children had been rescued
from the smugglers and 15 men had been charged with human
trafficking since Jan. 1.
   The latest reported interception occurred Friday when six women,
16 men and one child were caught in the border towns of Sahebnagar
and Bidirpur, the Dainik Bangla and Daily Itefaq newspapers said.
Two of the men were arrested on charges of trafficking in human
lives.
   By piecing together sketchy reports in Dhaka newspapers the past
three days, a picture emerges of how the traffickers operate:
   Eleven-year-old Najma Akthar was playing with friends at their
schoolyard last week in Munshiganj, just outside Dhaka, when a
middle-aged woman approached her.
   The woman said Najma's mother was seriously ill. Puzzled and
worried, the sixth-grader left the playground with the woman in a
rickshaw.
   Three days later, she and eight women who also had been lured
away on false pretenses were in Bidirpur, 90 miles northwest of
Dhaka. Border police rescued them before they could be taken across
the frontier.
   Others paid for what they thought would be passports to better
lives.
   Bangladesh, with 105 million people, is one of the world's most
densely populated nations. The per capital annual income is about
$150.
   ``I sold my jewelry to pay the man who promised me a job in
Pakistan,'' Dainik Bangla quoted Josna Rani Sarkar as saying.
   The 25-year-old woman, whose husband had deserted her, was one
of those found by border guards this week.
   Mrs. Sarkar and other women were quoted as saying they paid
between $100 and $200 for the journey.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the government was investigating local press reports that at
least 10,000 Bangladeshis had been jailed abroad for using false
passports and other papers.
   The Dainik Bangla, a Bengali-language newspaper, said last
October that police suspect some children have been smuggled out of
Bangladesh for more macabre purposes.
   The newspaper said there were unconfirmed reports that children
had been taken across the Indian border to West Bengal and killed
so their skeletons could be sold for medical studies.
   Bangladeshi officials have declined to comment on this report.
   Similar reports of Indian children being killed in 1984 surfaced
in the Indian state of Bihar. Headless bodies were found in a
river, and a box of children's skulls was later discovered at a
railway station in Patna, Bihar's capital.

   ``Platoon,'' the critically acclaimed
film about America's moral anguish and loss of innocence on
Vietnam's battlefields, has been drawing tens of thousands of
Vietnamese viewers, according to the official Vietnam News Agency.
   People have been flocking to watch the film on video in Ho Chi
Minh City, formerly Saigon, said a VNA report seen in Bangkok on
Saturday.
   The agency said ``Platoon'' was the first U.S. film about the
Vietnam war to be screened in Ho Chi Minh City since the communist
victory over U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975.
   The brief report noted that the film was directed by Oliver
Stone, who had fought in Vietnam, and that it received Academy
Awards in 1987.

   Falling off horses, plummeting oceanward in a
tangled parachute or fleeing an avalanche on a ski slope, Prince
Charles maintains an old royal tradition of thrills and spills.
   The royal pratfall had become enshrined as a national joke until
Thursday, when Charles narrowly escaped an avalanche that killed
his close friend, Maj. Hugh Lindsay, on a Swiss ski slope.
   British hearts missed a beat realizing how close the avalanche
had come to claiming the 39-year-old heir to the throne. ``It is
only when you nearly lose someone that you become fully conscious
of how much you value them,'' commented novelist A.N. Wilson in the
Daily Mail.
   Inevitably, a cry went up for the royals to stop playing
daredevil. But at the same time Britons have come to expect it of
them, judging by the derision Charles's youngest brother Edward has
suffered in some quarters for shunning rugby and quitting the Royal
Marines prematurely.
   Zooming down the slopes with Charles at the Swiss resort of
Klosters were his wife, Princess Diana, and sister-in-law Sarah,
the Duchess of York.
   On the morning of the avalanche, Sarah, 28 and four months
pregnant, tumbled into a river while skiing. That probably was the
only reason she and Diana stayed in their chalet and were not on
the slopes when the avalanche broke loose.
   Sarah's husband Prince Andrew, Charles's other brother, was off
the Portuguese coast aboard the navy ship on which he serves as a
helicopter warfare instructor. A few hours after the avalanche, the
vessel lost a helicopter and two crewmen at sea.
   Andrew flew combat missions in the 1982 Falkland Islands war,
and few suggested he shouldn't. Risking one's life for the public
good is a tradition set in stone by King George VI, when he refused
to flee London during Hitler's blitz.
   Charles's sister, Anne, races horses and sometimes falls off
them. His father, Prince Philip, was a polo player and took a
well-photographed spill in a carriage-driving race. His mother,
Queen Elizabeth II, also is an accomplished, though more sedate,
equestrian.
   Anne's husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, has suffered a few riding
spills. He is also a repeat offender at the wheel, and recently was
fined for clocking more than 100 mph on a 70-mph highway.
   On the outer fringes of royalty, risky sports and high-speed
driving are routine. In 1972, Prince William of Gloucester, a
cousin of the queen, was killed flying in an air race.
   Charles has taken innumerable knocks on the sportsfields. He has
a small facial scar from a fall playing polo, and in Florida he
collapsed dehydrated during a match.
   On his first ski run he pitched headfirst into snow. Flying a
light plane he came within seconds of a midair collision.
   His first parachute jump in 1971 came equally close to disaster.
His foot snarled in the cords and he plunged thousands of feet
upside down before righting himself and ending up in the ocean.
   Charles's biographer, Anthony Holden, notes that the prince's
grand-uncle, Edward VIII, was forced by his father to give up
steeplechasing in the 1930s, but says it's unlikely the same will
happen to Charles.
   ``We cannot legislate about whether the Prince of Wales goes
skiing or not,'' he told a BBC interviewer.
   ``It's in his character. He feels a need to prove himself
physically.''
   In Charles, royalty-watchers see the dilemma of a vigorous man
in the prime of life, well-aware of his privileged status and
feeling forever compelled to justify it.
   Forced to stay out of politics, the endearingly jug-eared prince
is limited to speaking out on issues like modern architecture and
the plight of Britain's inner cities.
   He can only hint at his state of mind through remarks to friends
that reach the media second-hand. The picture that emerges is of a
man searching for a role, fearful of becoming a museum piece.
   His mother, at 61, shows no sign of giving up the throne, and
chances are he won't be king before he is in his fifties.
   He is exasperated at being labeled an eccentric because he is
interested in alternative medicine, communes in solitude with
nature and once let on that he talks to his plants.
   His reverence for nature permeated the elegant, passionate
statement he issued after the avalanche.
   He spoke of mountains needing to be ``treated with the greatest
respect,'' and of the avalanche as ``a whirling maelstrom as the
whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us into the valley below.''
   The Times of London, weighing the calls for the prince to stop
taking risks, concluded Saturday that he should carry on regardless.
   ``Should we become a nation whose competitive sporting instincts
were restricted to the chess board or the ping-pong table, we would
flourish neither in peace nor war,'' it said, ``and a great many
brave spirits would be stifled.''

   The death of Vietnamese Premier Pham
Hung has given a natural prod to recent leadership changes that
have brought Western-style economic reforms to Vietnam.
   Hung, 75 and the No. 2 man in the Communist Party hierarchy,
died of a heart attack in southern Vietnam on Thursday.
   Hung was among the last of the ``old guard,'' a group that
joined the revolution at its start but which saw its influence
dwindle as the party left the battlefields to confront the
challenge of economic development.
   Over six decades, he played key roles in ousting the French,
Japanese and Americans from Vietnam. But he also helped forge the
orthodox postwar policies the party now blames for Vietnam's
economic and social ruin.
   When Hung became premier in June 1987, Western diplomats saw him
as a ``transitional figure'' selected to ease the break with the
past and usher the way for technocrats more clearly identified with
reforms.
   The choice of Vo Van Kiet, a vice premier and chairman of the
State Planning Commission, as acting premier should give impetus to
the reform program.
   Western analysts regard Kiet and party General Secretary Nguyen
Van Linh as the country's leading proponents of reforms based on
material incentives, decentralized decision-making and limited free
enterprise.
   The two championed such reforms years before they were declared
the No. 1 priority at the Sixth National Party Congress in December
1986.
   Related reforms have included an easing of restrictions on the
media, attempts to open Vietnam to the West and reconciliation with
former South Vietnamese officials and other groups once considered
enemies of the regime.
   Other deaths have accelerated Vietnam's recent changes.
   In July 1986, party leader Le Duan, a hardliner, passed away.
Several months later, at the December congress, the new party
chief, Truong Chinh, relinquished his party post along with two
other party co-founders, Pham Van Dong and Le Duc Tho.
   Linh was chosen party general secretary and other pragmatists
including Kiet moved up the ranks of the Politburo, the most
powerful party group. In all, six of 13 Politburo members were
dropped at the congress.
   In June 1987, Dong resigned the premiership he had held since
1955 and Chinh resigned as Vietnam's president. That removed from
the top ranks the last of the party co-founders, an enduring clique
comparable to Russia's Bolshevik or China's ``Long March''
generations.
   In addition, a total of 17 ministers were sacked in major
government reshuffles in June 1986 and February 1987, and the
Politburo has ordered a purge of corrupt and inefficient
lower-level party and government officials to last until the end of
this year.
   Among Western diplomats, Hung had a reputation as a conservative
hardliner, largely because from 1980 to February 1987, he held the
powerful post of interior minister, which deals with internal
security.
   He shared many common experiences with other top officials who
emerged from the April 1975 communist victory bitter and defiant.
   Hung joined the revolution at the age of 16. The French arrested
him in 1931 and banished him to a decade and a half of hard labor
at the notorious prison island of Poulo Condore. From 1945 until
the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Hung held key party
posts in southern Vietnam.
   He assumed a high profile in defeating the South Vietnam
government and its American allies, who had replaced the French.
Hung was secretary of the South Vietnam commission of the party's
central committee and political commissar of the South Vietnam
Liberation Armed Forces, or the Viet Cong.
   In 1975, he served as political commissar of the Ho Chi Minh
campaign, the final North Vietnamese offensive which climaxed with
the capture of Saigon on April 30.

<TEXT>
   A Tatar leader scoffed Saturday at a government
overture to members of the disgruntled ethnic group and called a
plan to allow some Tatars to return to their Crimean homeland a
campaign to deceive the public.
   Reshat Dzhemilev, who was jailed for three years because he once
asked Saudi Arabia to aid the cause of his people, said Moscow's
move would affect only a small number of his people _ and only
those who toe the Communist Party line.
   ``It's a campaign to deceive the public, to create the
appearance of action,'' Dzhemilev said in a telephone interview.
   The Tatars were deported in 1944 from Crimea, a peninsula in the
Ukrainian republic that extends into the Black Sea.
   A government official told a commission in the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan on March 5 that Crimean Tatars who are ``the
most virtuous and well-proven in work and social life'' would be
allowed to return to Crimea, the newspaper Pravda Vostoka reported.
   The newspaper, in its March 6 edition, said the State Labor
Committee would decide which Crimean Tatars are eligible for
resettlement on the basis of recommendations from labor
collectives, and commissions of Crimean Tatars.
   Dzhemilev said he did not believe the Crimean Tatars who
attended the commission meeting in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent
faithfully expressed the wishes of most of his people.
   Pravda Vostok said the commission was made up of republic-level
representatives of Crimean Tatars and that the meeting also was
attended by officials of regional commissions.
   ``Two hundred families maybe will be allowed to move there, but
that will not solve the problem,'' said Dzhemilev, a leader in the
Crimean Tatar effort who lives in Tashkent but spoke during a visit
to Moscow. ``It's just supposed to distract attention.''
   The newspaper indicated that the Crimean Tatars would be allowed
to resettle ``as conditions are created'' primarily in steppe
regions of the Crimea. It hinted that resettlement will be limited
in the areas on the Black Sea that have become popular resorts.
   The Crimean Tatars, who number from 250,000 to 350,000, are
among the more than 100 national groups in the Soviet Union. Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said that ensuring national unity
while granting ethnic groups cultural and linguistic rights is
``the most vital, fundamental issue of our society.''
   The Crimean Tatars have been fighting for the right to return to
their ancestral homeland ever since they were driven away. In May
1944, soon after Soviet troops liberated the Crimea from Nazi
Germany, all the Crimean Tatars were charged with betraying their
country and forcibly deported.
   They were shipped in sealed freight cars to the eastern regions
of the Soviet Union, with most winding up in reservations in
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenia and Kirgizia. Thousands died
during deportation.
   The war crimes charges leveled against them were dropped in 1967
but the Tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the Crimea.
   The Crimean Tatars stage demonstrations regularly to press their
cause, the most recent being a rally March 5 outside a Moscow
hotel. Police broke up the protest and detained 15 of the 20
demonstrators, dissidents reported.
   The government set up a national commission headed by President
Andrei A. Gromyko to consider the Crimean Tatars' demands, and on
Feb. 3 it endorsed steps to promote the group's culture. It also
said new procedures had been adopted on resettlement, but did not
release details.

   It was an unforgettable getaway car,
unfortunately for a man accused of using the white Cadillac
limousine in two holdups and one attempted robbery.
   A man dressed in a black leather jacket entered a doughnut shop
early Friday and demanded money, police said. He got $20 and sped
off in the white limousine, victims told officers. Soon afterward,
a man tried to hold up a convenience store but fled without any
money, again in a white Cadillac.
   At another convenience store, the man escaped with $6, and
witnesses remembered the limousine and black leather jacket, too.
   Officer Gerald Young cruised the neighborhood looking for the
car, and spotted one in front of a house two blocks from one of the
stores.
   Alexander J. Fulton Jr., 36, came out of his house while police
were checking the car and asked what was going on, police said.
   Police found a black leather jacket, and witnesses identified
both Fulton and the car, they said. Fulton was booked on two counts
of armed robbery and one of attempted armed robbery.
   Fulton, police said, is the owner of Fulton Limousine Service.
It has one car _ a white Cadillac limousine.

   Finding out what is happening in Tibet has
become almost as difficult in this age of high-tech
telecommunications as it was for 19th-century adventurers who had
to scale snow-swept mountains to reach the fabled land.
   Chinese authorities, hypersensitive to criticism of their
Tibetan policies, have shut out all foreign reporters since
pro-independence Tibetans on March 5 staged their fourth protest in
five months.
   They also have halted plane ticket sales to foreigners in
Chengdu, the main gateway to Tibet.
   In the 19th century, Westerners faced possible death from frigid
temperatures and bandits when they set out to discover the
mysteries of Tibetan Buddhist worship and the location of their
gold and silver fields.
   Foreign reporters in 1988 have no clear picture of what would
happen if they somehow managed to evade the barriers and enter
Lhasa. Expulsion from China is one possibility. No news agency has
attempted it.
   Concern remains high that authorities are using Lhasa's
isolation to crack down heavily on youthful militants among the
city's fewer than 1,400 Tibetan Buddhist monks.
   One of the few official reports on the March 5 protest concluded
ominously: ``Local religious leaders ... demand justice against the
rioters (and) are of the opinion that the people's government has
exercised too much restraint and shown enough tolerance and
patience towards these people.''
   Closing off Lhasa was easy this time because most travel there
already had been halted following three independence protests in
September and October in which at least 14 people were killed and
dozens others arrested.
   Fourteen foreign journalists who went to Lhasa to cover those
protests were given 48 hours to leave Tibet.
   An official report said one policeman was killed in daylong
clashes March 5 between police and protesters, but unconfirmed
reports put casualties at 21 Tibetans and three police killed.
   A U.S. State Department official told The Associated Press that
at least 6,000 people took part in the riots and pro-independence
rallies.
   Only one reporter, from Agence-France Presse, was in Lhasa on
March 5 and he was ordered to leave the next day.
   The fewer than one dozen foreign travelers left in Tibet's
mile-high capital of Lhasa have become the only link, albeit a weak
one, to the outside world.
   Backpackers staying in Lhasa's grubby cold-water guesthouses
have been interviewed several times each day by reporters
telephoning from Chengdu and Beijing.
   Most have acknowledged the limits of their information _ some
don't speak Tibetan or Chinese, and those who do fear bringing
police attention to their Tibetan friends and so stay away from the
protests.
   Many sympathize with the Tibetan cause and all are anxious to
keep a low profile aware that Chinese authorities have blamed
foreigners for past protests.
   Chengdu, a city of 2.6 million people in western China's lush
Sichuan province, about 760 miles east of Lhasa, became a listening
post last week for several Western reporters.
   They met Lhasa's only outgoing flight each morning and
intercepted the few dozen passengers in hopes of obtaining updates
on conditions in the city.
   The interviews produced unconfirmed reports of hundreds, perhaps
as many as 1,000 arrests since March 5, several beating deaths of
arrested protesters and shows of force by convoys of more than 100
trucks filled with armed police.
   Authorities have refused to comment on the reports. Officials in
the Tibetan Autonomous Region's Foreign Affairs Office brusquely
told reporters who telephoned to put their questions in writing.
   The result is that reporters are hard put to screen fact from
fiction.
   Most foreigners in Lhasa or arriving in Chengdu from Tibet were
amazingly patient in answering reporters' questions.
   A Japanese traveler who spoke barely any English nonetheless
spent an hour trying to convey what he saw to non-Japanese-speaking
reporters, by using gestures and imitating the sound of automatic
rifle fire.
   Reporters wondered whether their calls to Lhasa might get the
recipients in trouble. One Tibetan woman who answered the telephone
at a hotel willingly answered a few questions and then asserted,
``I'm not afraid because ...'' when the line suddenly went dead.

   President Corazon Aquino told
military cadets Saturday to leave policy-making to civilians and
concentrate on defeating communist rebels on the battlefield.
   Meanwhile, a classified military intelligence report said the
rebels were losing support among the Filipino people and predicted
that the New People's Army would lose about half its fighters by
the end of Mrs. Aquino's term in 1992.
   The report appeared to contradict public statements by the armed
forces leadership that the rebellion is growing and poses a major
threat to Philippine democracy.
   Mrs. Aquino made her remarks during graduation exercises at the
Philippine Military Academy, on a mountaintop 130 miles north of
the capital of Manila.
   ``The insurgency war cannot be won by programs and speeches, nor
by commissions and committees,'' Mrs. Aquino told the crowd of
3,000. ``It will be fought, and it will be won, only by you and the
men you lead.''
   Mrs. Aquino reminded the 135 graduating cadets that ``policy is
the business of the civilian authorities.''
   She urged the graduates to place allegiance to the constitution
``above your deference to superiors or friendship for your peers.''
   Last year, cadets staged a brief sit-down strike in sympathy
with leaders of the August coup attempt in which at least 53 people
were killed and hundreds wounded, including Mrs. Aquino's only son,
Benigno Aquino III.
   Former Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of the August
coup attempt and a graduate of the academy, was arrested last
December in Manila.
   Mrs. Aquino said the academy curriculum would be revised to
emphasize small unit leadership and combat skills. She also
promised that officers who display skill in combat will be favored
for promotion.
   Honasan complained that corruption and favoritism had sapped the
fighting spirit of the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the
Philippines.
   About 2,000 troops stood guard during the commencement ceremony.
Soldiers armed with M-16 rifles and grenade launchers searched
vehicles entering the grounds and helicopter gunships hovered
overhead during Mrs. Aquino's speech.
   On March 18, 1987, four people were killed when a bomb exploded
during rehearsals for the annual graduation exercise. Officials
blamed right-wing extremists but no one was ever charged in the
blast.
   The academy, modeled after the U.S. Military Academy at West
Point, was established in 1904 to train officers for the Philippine
Constabulary while the country was an American colony. It now
trains all branches of the military.
   A classified military intelligence report on the communist
insurgency, made in a National Intelligence Estimate at the end of
1987, predicted the Communist Party will ``suffer increasing
political isolation by 1992.''
   The report, distributed to Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos in
January, says the party will have to step up military operations to
recover political support.
   The report predicted the rebels would escalate their campaign of
assassinations of police and soldiers ``to continuously project a
position of strength.'' The rebels claimed responsibility for
killing scores of police, soldiers and officials in Manila last
year.
   But the report estimated that the New People's Army, the party's
armed wing, had already decreased from 24,430 fighters in 1986 to
21,520 by the end of last year. It predicted the rebel army would
decline in strength to 12,170 by 1992, when Mrs. Aquino's term ends.
   Rebel supporters, or ``mass base,'' had declined from 3.6
million people to 3.1 million people since Mrs. Aquino took office
and was expected to decline to about 1 million by 1992, the report
added.
   The Associated Press obtained excerpts of the report from
sources who insisted on anonymity.
   The report attributed the decline in rebel strength to
improvements in the combat capability of the armed forces and Mrs.
Aquino's economic and political reforms.
   The forecast contradicts the military's public assessment of the
rebel threat. Last week, the army said the New People's Army
numbered 25,000 fighters and that the guerrillas had drawn up plans
to take power by 1992.

<TEXT>
   When a major international trade fair
opened here last week, the welcoming speech to hundreds of foreign
buyers and sellers came from a man the government considers a
traitor.
   Aurelio Barria, the young, energetic owner of an import-export
business, took time off from trying to overthrow his country's
military regime to tell the exposition delegates of Panama's
advantages as a marketplace.
   If that had a certain strangeness to it, it only served to
underscore the complexity of the crisis in Panama, where politics,
power and money are almost inseparable.
   ``Panama is undergoing what you might call a `neutron bomb'
revolution,'' said one Western diplomat. ``The government's
opponents are trying to destroy it without destroying the country,
and it's a tricky task.''
   The diplomat was referring not only to the internal opposition
but to the United States, where the Reagan administration has been
reluctant to impose tougher economic sanctions against Panama
despite strong public support for such action.
   With only two opposing votes, the U.S. House on Thursday called
for a prompt, get-tough policy to rid Panama of its military
strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. In floor debate, he was
described by one representative after another as a thug, a thief, a
tyrant and a drug trafficker.
   But in announcing new sanctions on Friday, President Reagan
heeded the advice of his chief of staff, Howard Baker, and his
national security adviser, Colin L. Powell, who had been urging a
more moderate course.
   The president ordered the withholding of Panama Canal fees due
the country that amount to about $6.5 million a month, eliminated
preferential tariffs on its exports and told customs officials to
keep a closer eye out for ``drug smugglers and money launderers''
from Panama.
   But Reagan stopped short of a total trade embargo, which many in
Congress had urged, and didn't exercise other punitive economic
measures at his disposal. He did say he was prepared to take
further steps if Noriega doesn't resign.
   Barria and other anti-Noreiga Panamanians are concerned that any
drastic measures designed to remove him could wreak havoc on the
country, like a harsh chemotherapy treatment that debilitates the
patient while attacking his cancer.
   ``What we want is not to destroy the country, and not even just
to get rid of General Noriega, but to end military domination of
the civilian government,'' Barria said recently.
   Barria is the president of Panama's Chamber of Commerce,
Industry and Agriculture. He was re-elected to a second term late
last year while in exile, having fled the country after being
charged by the government with sedition.
   The treason charge came as a result of his principal occupation
since last June, that of a leader of an anti-Noriega coalition of
business, professional, labor and political groups known as the
National Civic Crusade.
   ``I haven't really attended to my business in months,'' said
Barria, who returned to Panama in January after being freed on
bail. Then he added with a laugh: ``Hell, I don't even know if I
have one left.''
   Whatever the status of Barria's business, one of the major props
of Panama's economy appears to have suffered irreparable losses in
the past nine months of civil turmoil.
   ``The banking system as it existed ... is destroyed,'' said a
source close to Panama's financial community. He, like the
diplomat, spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   The source said as much as $12 billion has been transferred out
of Panama by wary depositors since the Civic Crusade began its
effort to oust Noriega last summer with a series of demonstrations.
The 118 banks that make this country one of the world's largest
offshore banking centers began 1987 with more than $40 billion in
deposits.
   The amount of money that has fled Panama's banking center cannot
be confirmed. The government only will admit a crisis exists _ one
it blames largely on the United States.
   Most of the money deposited in offshore banks in Panama never
contributed directly to the nation's economy. It neither was taxed
nor used to finance home mortgages, car loans, new businesses or
industry or capital improvements.
   ``It was just there on paper,'' said the banking industry
source. But shuffling that paper did provide employment for about
9,000 people and led to a building boom. In that way, the banking
industry contributed, along with real estate, 14.5 percent of the
nation's gross national income.
   The offshore institutions are branches of major banks from more
than 30 countries engaged primarily in the sheltering of funds from
Latin American depositors who are weary of political instability in
their own countries.
   Among the hardest hit banks, when the money began fleeing the
country last year, were the 12 institutions owned by Panamanians.
Much of the money on deposit in them was transferred either to
Panama's international banks or to other countries.
   Then, on Feb. 25, the country's civilian, figurehead president,
Eric Arturo Delvalle, called for the dismissal of Noriega, who had
been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida almost three
weeks earlier on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Within hours, Noriega proved who the real boss of Panama is by
engineering Delvalle's ouster.
   That triggered a new, greater run on the Panamanian banks and
they closed four days later, on March 1. Two days after that, the
government ordered them to remain closed, admitting that it could
not provide enough money to cover anticipated withdrawals. It also
closed temporarily the 106 foreign banks.
   The banks remain closed, with no sign they will reopen this
week. The situation has created chaos for individuals and
businesses as well. All are strapped for cash.
   The Noriega government says it is a victim of ``economic
aggression'' by the United States, where federal courts have tied
up some $50 million in official Panamanian funds on deposit in U.S.
banks. At question is whether the money rightfully should be
controlled by Noriega or Delvalle.
   Delvalle has been in hiding for two weeks, but the United States
still considers him the legitimate president. The Civic Crusade
leaders, who used to refer to Delvalle as a puppet, also have
reluctantly endorsed him as the true constitutional authority.
   Some opposition leaders complained privately that State
Department officials forced them to support Delvalle and join him
in a call last week for a new transitional government pending
elections scheduled for next year.
   Said a diplomatic source: ``It's important at this point that
they appear united, that they not be fighting among themselves. I
think Washington made that point to them. What happens to Delvalle
later is something they can work out at the appropriate time.''

   A prosecutor charged Saturday that Anwar
Sadat's brother and other relatives used the slain president's name
``to ruin the country'' and should lose $8.2 million in property as
punishment.
   Esmat Sadat, already convicted of using his brother's position
to enrich himself during Anwar Sadat's 11 years in office,
responded that the prosecution was sullying the late president's
name by making the accusations.
   The exchange came during a hearing of the Ethics Court to decide
whether the assets of Esmat Sadat, three sons and seven other
family members should be confiscated.
   The property, estimated at $8.2 million, was sequestered in 1983
after the defendants' convictions on influence peddling, black
marketeering, bribery and other charges. Esmat Sadat and three sons
were sentenced to one-year prison terms.
   The court adjourned Saturday after both sides presented their
arguments. A decision is expected on April 9.
   As the prosecution presented its case Saturday, blaming Sadat's
relatives for ``using the late leader's name to ruin the country,''
Esmat stood and objected vigorously.
   ``The prosecution insists on using the name of the late
leader,'' Esmat said loudly from the third row of benches.
   ``His name should not be used as a (prosecution) tool,'' he
said, looking shaken.
   Sayed Abdel-Baky, president of the seven-man tribunal hearing
the case, admonished Esmat not to interrupt the proceedings and
said such comments would be heard at the end of the hearing.
   ``We are only glorifying the name of the late president,'' said
assistant prosecutor Mohsen Mahmoud. ``At the center of this case
is the exploitation of the late president's name.''
   He cited examples of the defendants' use of the family name to
win government contracts outside bureaucratic channels required of
most private citizens.
   The late president, killed by Moslem extremists on Oct. 6, 1981,
was absolved of any wrongdoing in Esmat's earlier trial.
   The Ethics Court is empowered to sequester property and order
defendants detained for up to five years. After that, the
prosecutor may ask the court to confiscate a defendant's property
in the name of the state.
   The court can decide whether to permanently seize the property,
keep it sequestered and allow the prosecutor's office to control
the assets, or return the property to the defendants.

   About 150 people rode a convoy of 47
trucks and vans through Taipei on Saturday to demand direct
elections for Taiwan's provincial governor and the mayors of the
island's two largest cities.
   Leaders of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, standing
on top of the vans, chanted slogans during the two-hour
demonstration. Banners hung from the cars, including one that read:
``Governmental appointment is a symbol of authoritarian rule.''
   Under existing law, the provincial governor and the mayors of
Taipei and Kaohsiung, a southern port, are appointed by the
Nationalist government.
   Opposition lawmaker Kang Ning-hsiang, who organized the
demonstration, said the appointed officials ``lack support of the

   The demonstration was approved by the police and ended without
any violence.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to withhold a $6.5
million payment owed to Panama next Tuesday was aimed at impairing
military strongman Manuel Noriega's ability to pay government
workers this coming week, according to U.S. officials.
   ``The timing was no coincidence,'' one official said, expressing
hope that the departure of Noriega could be hastened if government
workers, faced with economic hardship, join the ranks of the
opposition.
   The remaining sanctions Reagan imposed on Friday will not have
an immediate consequence, and the officials believe Noriega could
be out of office by the time they have an impact.
   The sanctions were the latest in a series of steps the United
States has taken over the past eight months to undercut Noriega,
who is under U.S. indictment on drug smuggling charges.
   According to reports from Panama, the government is so strapped
for cash that it has been considering several austerity measures to
deal with payroll budget shortfalls.
   They included delaying paychecks to the nation's 150,000
government workers, reducing their pay temporarily or giving them
partial payment in food instead of cash, the reports said.
   Outside the 15,000-member Defense Force, the regime's main
source of support has been government workers. If civil servants
begin turning against Noriega, that would narrow his already small
base of support even further, said the U.S. officials, insisting on
anonymity.
   The soldiers were paid last Thursday but Monday is payday for
the nation's 20,000 school teachers, and thousands of other
government workers are due their paychecks on Tuesday.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who opposes Noriega, said the cash
shortage forced Panama to default on a $39 million loan repayment
due last week to the government of Japan.
   Sosa has remained loyal to ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle
and has refused to relinquish his post to a successor named by
Noriega. Sosa shares the Reagan administration view that Delvalle's
ouster by Noriega two weeks ago was unconstitutional.
   Before last Friday, the administration had suspended all
economic and military aid to Panama and ordered U.S.
representatives in international lending institutions to oppose
loan requests from Panama.
   Beyond that, it has lent its support to legal efforts by
Delvalle's representatives here to freeze Panamanian assets in the
United States.
   As a result, Panama does not have access to the revenues it
normally receives from American use of a trans-isthmian pipeline
that sends Alaskan oil on its way to East Coast U.S. ports. Those
revenues have been variously estimated at between $80 and $120
million a year.
   In addition, Panamanian assets in U.S. banks, estimated at $50
million, also have been frozen.
   Noriega has been attempting to rally support from his countrymen
by blaming the United States for Panama's financial problems. But
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Noriega's campaign has not
worked and that the United States and the Panamanian people are
``on the same side.''
   Reagan tightened the screws on Friday when he ordered the $6.5
million fee due to Panama for canal-related services placed in
escrow. It will be released once civilian government is restored,
he said.
   Reagan also acted to strip Panama of the right to sell its
products in U.S. markets either duty-free or at the lowest tariffs
rates possible. These benefits are given to Panama under a system
of tariff preferences accorded to Third World countries and under
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, designed to help 21 countries in
that region.
   But most of Panama's income from U.S. exports would not be
affected by the sanction because they carry no duties to begin
with. Examples are bananas, shellfish, fish and coffee, which
account for well over half of Panama's annual U.S. exports.
   Two items which will be affected by Reagan's action are
sweaters, a $23.5 million business for Panama last year, and
petroleum products, $14.6 million. U.S. government estimates of
Panama's total exports to the United States range between $342
million and $388 million.

   Hugh Wolfe Frank, chief interpreter at the

   Frank had been suffering from Parkinson's disease and was known
to be depressed about his worsening health.
   Wiltshire police said Saturday they did not suspect any crime in
connection with his death and had reported the facts to assistant
Wiltshire coroner Peter Stoddart.
   Frank, who was separated from his fifth wife, was a skillful

Nuremberg, West Germany, of top Nazis, including Hermann Goering
and Rudolf Hess.
   The Wiltshire coroner's office has ordered an inquest into his

   A former national police chief,
convicted of involvement in the torture death of a student
dissident, was released Saturday after his eight-month prison
sentence was suspended.
   The Seoul District Criminal Court found Kang Min-chang guilty of
misfeasance and dereliction of duty, but immediately suspended his
sentence in consideration of his contribution to the nation.
   Kang was arrested in January, nearly a year after a dissident
college student died while being questioned in police custody.
Police at first said it was an accident but later admitted the
student was killed by torture.
   The case triggered widespread anti-government protests, leading
to the arrest of eight police officers.
   A fresh controversy flared in January when the opposition urged
the government to punish high-ranking police officiers who
allegedly covered up the cause of the student's death.

<HEAD>Florida Indictment Shows Haiti Emerging As Cocaine Way Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug indictment of a top Haitian military
officer has spotlighted that nation's emergence as a way station
for cocaine traffickers seeking safer routes and reinforces charges
that corrupt officials aid smugglers.
   Col. Jean-Claude Paul, along with his brother and ex-wife, were
charged in a federal indictment unsealed Thursday with using a
landing strip on the colonel's farm to fly a 100-kilogram, or
220-pound, cocaine shipment to the Bahamas for delivery to Miami.
   Haitian President Leslie Manigat has turned Paul's case over to
his country's military courts for investigation. There is no
extradition treaty between Haiti and the United States.
   One of the principal witnesses in the case, Osvaldo Quintana,
told reporters in January that he saw 9,000 kilograms, or 19,800
pounds, of cocaine in duffel bags in the Haitian presidential
palace during the administration of ousted leader Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   Quintana also told The Associated Press that other Haitian
officials besides Paul had a role in the smuggling, but he would
not disclose their names.
   The alleged trafficking by high-level Haitians has angered Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., who said he will introduce legislation this
week to lift U.S. trade preferences with Haiti.
   ``This indictment is further indication that we can't tolerate a
regime in Haiti that seized power from the Haitian people so it
could continue the oppression of the past,'' said Graham.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook said better
technology such as improved radar and more cooperation from
Bahamian authorities have sharply limited the traditional drug
routes into South Florida.
   That has forced Colombian cocaine traffickers to go through
other Caribbean islands.
   ``We have seen an increase in Haiti being used as a
transshipment point since we stepped up enforcement,'' said Hook.
   Asked about Quintana's allegations that other Haitian officials
are involved, Hook would say only that the investigation is
continuing.
   ``The message that this case sends is the corrupting effects on
public officials everywhere becuse of drug trafficking,'' said Hook.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., was blunter about the Haitian
connection.
   ``More than two years ago I questioned the DEA about increased
drug trafficking through Haiti, and about government involvement in
the traffic,'' Smith said recently.
   He said the DEA told him then they had no information on Haitian
officials' involvement in drug smuggling.
   ``This is the kind of head-in-the-sand attitude that has allowed
government after government to fall prey to the Colombian
cartels,'' said Smith.
   Whether it is a few corrupt officials, a policy of the new
military-supported government, or just coincidence, Haiti's role
has changed since Duvalier fled.
   ``There has been some increase in drug interceptions since the
Haitian government changed two years ago,'' acknowledged Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson.
   He said drug officials are spotting more planes flying over the
Haitian half of the island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with
the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic recently shot down a
suspected trafficker, but Simpson said Haiti does not have the
resources to chase drug planes.
   Hook said that since November the DEA has had an office in
Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, and is optimistic that Haitian
officials will cooperate.
   In the 90 days before the DEA's arrival, Haitian customs
officials seized 1,500 pounds of cocaine hidden on planes at
Port-au-Prince's airport, he said.
   And the Paul case should make it even more difficult for
traffickers, he said.
   ``The publicity is going to put a little heat on Haiti,'' said
Hook.
   But he said no one should expect trafficking to cease if Haiti
clamps down, since smugglers are already using Cuba, the Turks and
Caicos Islands and other routes.
   ``There is no Caribbean island close to the United States that
has gone unscathed,'' said Hook. ``It just shows the magnitude of
the problem.''

   A speeding freight train derailed near the Baltic
port of Klaipeda in Lithuania, breaking open 23 tank cars that
spilled fuel over a 1,300-foot stretch of railway, the Tass news
agency reported Saturday.
   Tass said workers had blocked the flow of oil into the nearby
Baltic Sea, but did not make clear whether the spill was contained
before some of the oil reached the water.
   There was no indication whether there was any permanent
environmental damage or whether the accident caused casualties.
   The accident occurred near Klaipeda, but Tass did not say how
far away from the Soviet's major fuel-shipping port on the Baltic.
   ``Twenty three tanks, which were deformed and derailed, leaked
oil products to both sides of the railway embankment,'' Tass said.
   ``According to tentative information, the accident occurred
because safe speed at the turn of the railway was exceeded,'' the
news agency said, quoting a Baltic railway official identified as
Dmitri Blyaskin.
   Rail traffic resumed midday Saturday after a halt of several
hours, Tass said.

   Authorities released two men they had
described as prime suspects in a two-state killing spree after the
men passed lie detector tests, their prints didn't match those on a
weapon and a witness failed to identify them.
   Authorities had planned to hold a hearing Friday night to
determine if they had probable cause to hold the men in connection
with four brutal slayings on Monday in Gainesville, Texas;
Farmersville, Texas; and in Saratoga, Ark. But when the two passed
lie detector tests, authorities canceled the hearing and agreed
unanimously to let the men go.
   The men were given tickets for a bus bound for Terre Haute,
Ind., hometown of one of the men, officials said.
   ``It was a misidentification is what it was,'' one of the men
said. ``We fit the description, so what else can you say? It's not
my fault somebody else out there looks like me.''
   The other man told The Dallas Morning News he was terrified to
learn ``I was facing death row.''
   ``I thought I was going to die for something I didn't do,'' he
said.
   Prosecuting attorney Jim Hudson Jr. said a man who reported
having a run-in with the apparent killers the night of the Arkansas
murder was unable Friday to identify the two men in custody.
   Their release leaves officials without a suspect in the slaying
of Deana Andrews Woodard, 23, who was found in her Gainesville,
Texas, mobile home Monday with her throat slashed, police said.
   Authorities believe Ms. Woodard's slaying is connected to the
fatal shootings of Cecil Floyd Morrison, 85, and Cecil Leonard
Morrison, 62. The two were killed in their Farmersville, Texas,
home. The men's pickup truck was found later in southwestern
Arkansas, and officers said a prescription of Ms. Woodard's was
found in the vehicle.
   A description of two men who hitched a ride Monday night with
Kenneth Olden, 34, of Saratoga, whose body was found Tuesday, led
authorities to the men who were arrested and released. Olden's body
was dumped along a road after he had been shot three times.
   ``They fit the description. But when all the evidence came back
in, the fingerprints didn't match (those lifted from a murder
weapon) and they passed a polygraph,'' said Hempstead County
Sheriff Don Worthey said.

   Assistant Secretary of State Chester A.
Crocker will hold his first talks in two years with South Africa's
foreign minister in an effort to advance a U.S. peace initiative
for southern Africa, the State Department said Saturday.
   Crocker's meeting with Roelof ``Pik'' Botha next week at an
unspecified European location also will give the United States an
opportunity to ``register concern'' about recent developments in
South Africa, spokeswoman Anita Stockman said. The United States
has complained about anti-dissent measures proposed in South Africa
in the past few weeks.
   A State Department working group arrived in Angola on Wednesday
to explore the possibility of further talks on getting the
estimated 40,000 Cuban troops out of the country as part of an
overall settlement, Stockman said.
   Since he took office in 1981, Crocker has been seeking to
negotiate a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in return for
South African withdrawal from neighboring Namibia.
   The Cuban troops have been battling a powerful guerrilla force,
UNITA, which is backed by South African and U.S. assistance.
   In what appeared to be a major breakthrough when Crocker was in
Angola in January, Cuba declared its willingness in principle to
pull the troops out of the country, but the overall settlement that
would bring that about is still to be arranged.
   Angola has said South African willingness to participate in the
negotiations _ and abide by a United Nations resolution giving
independence to Namibia _ is a necessary ingredient of a settlement.
   Stockman said Crocker's meeting with Botha will ``afford an
opportunity to reassess South Africa's willingness to proceed
toward a settlement involving total Cuban troop withdrawal from
Angola and Namibian independence based on U.N. Security Council
resolution 435.''
   Crocker also is expected to restate U.S. demands for a cessation
of cross border forays by South African troops and concern about a
new crackdown on groups seeking more rights for the country's black
majority.
   Last month, the government outlawed the political activities of
17 anti-apartheid organizations. The government has also introduced
legislation to bar a wide range of organizations from receiving
foreign funds.
   Foreign governments and private agencies send millions of
dollars in assistance to these groups as a way of aiding South
Africans without sending funds to their government.

<TEXT>
   A three-week festival featuring Soviet music
opened with envoys for President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev praising the organizers of the cultural exchange for
bringing the two countries closer together.
   ``Making Music Together,'' with its 285 Soviet musicians,
dancers, composers and other artists, is the first part of an
exchange that will bring a celebration focusing on American
contemporary music to Moscow in the fall of 1989.
   Reagan's praise came in a letter to Sarah Caldwell, a key
organizer of the exchange and artistic director of the Opera
Company of Boston. It was read Friday night by Greg Guroff of the
government-run U.S. Information Agency.
   The letter described the event as ``one of the most ambitious
cultural projects ever undertaken between the United States and the
Soviet Union ... a testament to the potential of U.S.-Soviet
cooperation in artistic and cultural endeavors.''
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who flew from Washington to
attend opening ceremonies, read Gorbachev's ``best wishes for
success for the benefit of peace, friendship and cooperation
between our two nations.''
   Also present at the ornate, turn-of-the century Boston Opera
House was Yuri Melentiev, the minister of culture of Russia, the
Soviet Union's largest republic.
   Melentiev told reporters the festival stood as a symbol of
improved superpower relationships in the wake of the meeting
between Reagan and Gorbachev in Washington late last year.
   The festival is in the red because of unexpected costs that
drove the price tag above the estimated budget of $2.4 million to
$3.3 million, and organizers last month seriously considered the
idea of declaring bankruptcy and canceling the event.
   But organizers said they decided not to call if off after being
told by the State Department that cancellation could mar relations
with the Soviet Union.
   Harold Hestes, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of
Commerce and a key fund-raiser, said shortly before the opening
ceremonies that the original shortfall of $900,000 had been reduced
to about $200,000.

   Last September, the FBI asked 20 New York-area
libraries to watch for and report on library users who might be
gathering information for hostile powers. Library officials
refused, calling the move an effort to turn librarians into
informers.
   That incident is one of 60 that were added last year by the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to a summary of
actions ``taken by the Reagan administration since 1981 to restrict
public and media access to government information.''
   The committee's list now has more than 200 items, which
``underscores that contempt for the public's right to know
permeates virtually all facets of the current administration's
information policy,'' said Jane E. Kirtley, executive director of
the committee.
   The FBI said its attempt to recruit librarians was part of a
national counterintelligence initiative. When the attempt was
disclosed by The New York Times, James Fox, deputy assistant
director of the New York FBI office said, ``All we are interested
in is the fact that a hostile diplomat is there. We don't want
librarians to become amateur sleuths.''
   Some of the new items on the committee list are:
   _``Revelations by Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, head of the National
Security Agency, that he regularly refers cases of news leaks to
the Justice Department, asking that the journalists reporting the
information be prosecuted under espionage laws.''
   _Refusal by the Justice Department to disclose its financial
settlement with the families of the Challenger astronauts. News
media, including The Associated Press, went to court and last week
were granted access to the records.
   _In November, reporters for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution
asked the Bureau of Prisons for names of prisoners inside the
federal penitentiary in Atlanta when 1,100 Cuban prisoners held
that prison for 11 days. The bureau refused, citing a policy of
protecting prisoners' privacy by not giving out their names.
   _Last month, President Reagan asked Congress for a new exemption
to the Freedom of Information Act that would require federal
agencies to withhold government-generated and government-owned
scientific and technical information. It would be the 10th
exemption to the FOI act and the first since 1974, the committee
said.
   _In March last year, Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., ``lambasted''
reporters for questioning Reagan during a photo session. ``Simpson
said reporters did `a sadistic little disservice' by questioning
the president while he was off balance.''

<HEAD>Americans Ignoring Cancer-Prevention Diet</HEAD>

   The American diet is lousy and people are
dying because of it.
   That's the conclusion of a long-term study by the National
Cancer Institute of what Americans eat and don't eat during a
typical day.
   ``We really need to change the way we eat,'' said Gladys Block,
an NCI scientist and coauthor of a study published this month in
the American Journal of Public Health. ``I really believe that
could make a difference in the amount of cancer we have.''
   Americans are not eating enough fruits, vegetables, whole-grain
breads and high-fiber cereals. They are eating more fat and more
salt-cured, nitrite-cured, smoked and pickled meat, all dietary
elements that can affect health.
   In effect, said Blossom Patterson, a coauthor of the study,
Americans are forgetting the lessons they should have learned as
children at the family dining table.
   ``It's not really a new message,'' said Patterson. ``This is the
same theme that mothers have been playing for a long, long time.
Eat your vegetables and fruits.''
   And, says the NCI, if you eat like your mommies told you to, you
may live a longer time.
   The study said that diet is estimated to contribute to about 35
percent of all cancer deaths.
   Block said that the right foods have been shown to help prevent
cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, breast, oral cavity and
esophagus. Statistics released earlier this year show that all of
these types of cancer have increased in frequency. Block said the
message is that to eat well may mean to live longer. And she said
Americans simply aren't doing that.
   In interviews with more than 11,000 people, researchers from the
NCI and Department of Agriculture found that:
   _ On a typical day, 40 percent of Americans do not eat a single
fruit, and 20 percent have no vegetable.
   _ Only about 49 percent of Americans include ``garden
vegetables'' (vegetables other than potatoes or salad) in their
daily diet.
   _ More than 80 percent of those surveyed ate no high-fiber
cereals or whole-grain breads.
   _ Daily fiber intake, from whole grains or from vegetables such
as corn or dried peas and beans, averaged about 11 grams. The
recommended amount is 20 to 30 grams daily.
   _ More than 40 percent of those surveyed ate at least one
serving of lunch meat or bacon daily. These are foods high in fat
and salt, and may be smoked or cured with nitrites.
   Women, generally, had a better diet than men, and people over
age 55 usually had better diets than young adults, said Block.
   ``Even so, all groups showed a dramatic need for improvement,
with consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole-grains falling far
short of desirable levels,'' she said.
   Patterson said that even though fruits and vegetables high in
vitamins A and C are thought to be of special importance in
lowering cancer risk, 75 percent of those interviewed failed to
include these items in their daily diets.
   In a racial breakdown of the data, Patterson said the survey
showed that black people ate more vegetables than did whites,
largely due to a higher consumption of greens, such as collards.
Whites, however, ate more whole-grain breads and high-fiber cereals.
   Income also plays a role, she said. Those with higher incomes
tended to eat more fruits and vegetables, along with more red meat.
   By region, more people ate poultry and fish in the South and
Northeast than in the West and Midwest, and red meat consumption
was lowest in the South. High-fiber cereal consumption was highest
in the Northeast and West, and lowest in the South.
   The survey data was collected between 1976 and 1980, but Block
said that preliminary studies of more recent surveys show there has
been little change. And the consumption patterns from the 1976-80
survey, in turn, show almost no change from data collected from
1971 to 1974.
   Block said researchers are becoming increasingly convinced that
simple changes in diet, such as just adding an apple or orange or
some cole slaw to a typical fast food meal, could make a difference.
   ``If everybody just had fruit and vegetables every day, that
could lead to a drop in the number of cancers,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush's apparent lock on
the Republican presidential nomination is beginning to cool
Democratic excitement over the prospect of a brokered national
convention.
   Barring a collapse of unimaginable proportions, Bush will spend
the final months of the primary season seeking support for the fall
campaign from independent voters and potential Democratic converts.
   The longer the Democratic nominating war goes on, the better
Bush likes it. A Democratic National Convention this summer
featuring bloodletting on prime-time TV would suit him just fine.
   Democrats know this well, and that may give them an impetus to
rally around a candidate sooner rather than later, particularly
given Bush's evident vulnerability on the Iran-Contra affair.
   No one understands this better than Jimmy Carter. The former
president told an audience in Connecticut last week that he emerged
from the 1976 and 1980 conventions ``weaker than I went in.''
   He said the Democrats should find a ``winning ticket'' and unite
behind it in Atlanta.
   ``Why is 51 percent the magic number?'' asks New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo. ``Let's pick the guy who's ahead after California,'' the
last state to vote in the primary season.)
   ``If Mike Dukakis has 41 percent (of the delegates), get
everybody together in a room and say, `Jesse (Jackson) Gore,
Gephardt, you came close, but Mike's the candidate.''
   That would avoid what Carter calls the ``circus'' type of
convention that twice nominated him.
   Carter's lead over Republican Gerald Ford declined steadily
during the 1976 fall campaign, although he won a close call. In
1980, weakened politically, he triumped over Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
in an emotional convention struggle before losing a landslide to
Ronald Reagan.
   Carter says that this time, he and the 645 so-called Democatic
superdelegates, ``will have a burning desire to put together a
winning ticket'' when they convene in Atlanta.
   That makes the Senate Democratic caucus, which picks 43
delegates on April 19, and the House Democratic caucus, which picks
210 delegates a day later, as critical as any Democratic primary
waged with television advertising, phone banks and direct mail.
   The same is true for the 362 members of the Democratic National
Committee who are superdelegates, and the 25 governors.
   ``The key now to this thing ending early is superdelegates,''
says Robert Beckel, a Democratic campaign consultant not aligned
with any of this year's contenders. ``They're also the key to not
ending it early.''
   Any candidate who succeeds in picking up a large amount of
support from the people selected in those two congressional
meetings will be able to send a clear signal to the party that he
is the presumptive nominee, even before the primary season ends.
   To earn that support, a contender would presumably have to score
well in the industrial state contests leading up to the
congressional caucuses _ Illinois, Michigan, Connecticut, Wisconsin
and New York.
   Richard Gephardt, the Missouri congressman, already has the
support of several dozen House members. He probably could
consolidate his strength if he mounted a comeback after his poor
Super Tuesday showing. But he if fails to win in Michigan's
caucuses March 26, he is a likely dropout, and his supporters are
free to go elsewhere.
   Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee must show quickly that he can win
in the industrial states or he will have littel claim on the
allegience of Congress members.
   Jesse Jackson is in the process of obtaining a large bloc of
perhaps 800 delegates, and figures prominently in the brokered
convention scenarios that occupy Democratic political insiders. He
will get his share of support in Congress, as elsewhere, but most
House and Senate members aren't likely to go over to his side.
   The Democrat who now looks in the strongest position in the
race, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, would have to run well in
the industrial states, and probably signal his willingness to name
a southerner as his running mate in the fall.
   Carter said he and the party leaders want a winning ticket, and
Dukakis, for all the boasting over his primary wins in Texas and
Florida, ran poorly among disaffected Democrats that the party
needs to win the presidency.
   Gore whipped him among Democrats who voted for President Reagan
in 1984, 39 percent to 23 percent, according to ABC interviews on
Super Tuesday with primary voters in 12 southern states.
   Dukakis defeated Gore among liberals and the two split the
moderate vote. But Gore won among self-described conservatives, 38
percent to 21 percent, according to the ABC polls.

<TEXT>
   A father whose two teen-age sons joined the
racist Skinheads group turned them in to police after one of them
confessed to fatally stabbing a homeless black man.
   ``I can't elaborate on it. But I will say that I did turn them
in,'' Lowell ``Bud'' McKee told the St. Petersburg Times. ``There
are more things involved than I can make public.''
   Scott McKee, 18, and Dean McKee, 16, members of the Skinheads, a
group known for its hatred of blacks, Jews and homosexuals, were
arrested March 4 and charged with first-degree murder in the
December slaying of Isiah Walker, 41.
   McKee, who adopted the boys in 1977 after marrying their mother,
also told The Tampa Tribune he tried to commit his younger son to a
crisis unit last month but gave up after he was referred from
agency to agency.
   He sought treatment for Dean after the boy ran away several
times and threatened to kill his mother and himself if he were
placed in a program for disturbed children, McKee said. He did not
know about the slaying at the time, he said.
   McKee said he wanted to get his son committed under the state's
mental health act, which lets judges order the temporary detention
of anyone deemed by mental health experts to be a danger to
themselves or others. But mental health officials said threats
don't always constitute proof of mental illness.
   Dean was hospitalized for two months at age 15 after attempting
suicide and had private counseling for six months after he was
released, McKee said.

   Elisabeth Ann Zinser, who resigned as
president of Gallaudet University amid protests from students who
want a deaf leader, enraged students and faculty at the school for
the hearing impaired by suggesting she would quickly learn sign
language.
   In truth, say professors at Gallaudet, learning sign language _
widely considered the nation's third most frequently used
``foreign'' language _ is as difficult as mastering Russian or
Chinese.
   ``She (Zinser) thought she would come in here and pick up sign
language in three months,'' said Robert Johnson, an audiology
professor at the nation's only liberal arts college for the hearing
impaired. ``Unfortunately, you don't catch sign like you catch a
cold.''
   There are three different varieties of sign language, the purest
of which has no connection with the English language, while the
crudest version relies heavily on English vocabulary and sentence
structure, Johnson said.
   Johnson and Scott Lidell, both professors in Gallaudet's
department of linguistics, say around 2 million Americans are
considered deaf by audiometric standards, while 18 million others
suffer from some hearing loss.
   Those who use sign language are usually in the smaller group,
while persons with less severe hearing loss do not usually learn
sign language. The majority of Gallaudet's students are profoundly
deaf, and use sign language, according to school officials.
   American Sign Language, the purest form of signing, is commonly
used between people who are either profoundly deaf, or have been
deaf since birth, Johnson said. Comparing ASL to the use of a
foreign language, ASL users are roughly equivalent to those fluent
in a foreign tongue.
   But similarities with written or spoken language end there,
Johnson emphasized.
   ``English relies on a linear structure, with one word following
the last, but in ASL, the message is conveyed through simultaneous
use of facial expressions, finger signs, and motions,'' Johnson
said.
   ASL has a base vocabulary on which general themes, not
individual words, are built. Images, rather than words expressed in
sign, convey the signer's message.
   ``It's extremely time-efficient,'' Lidell said. ``You have two
hands, a face, and a body participating in delivering the message.
In spoken or written English, you have just words. Signing gives
you more channels.''
   Deaf people comunicating with hearing people mix sign language
with some components of formal English, the result being a type of
sign language called Contact Variety Signing, or Pidgin Sign
English.
   In the Contact Variety method, the message expressed may use
numerous images associated with ASL, but the message is based on
the syntax of an English sentence.
   It is this form of communication through which Gallaudet student
protest leaders, with the assistance of interpreters, conveyed
their message to the media and campus onlookers.
   Sign Supported English is the third type of sign. It does not
rely on facial expressions, and involves sending messages primarily
with spoken English. Signing symbols are used to reinforce the
spoken message, in what Johnson describes as ``coding speech on the
hands.''
   Sign Supported English, Johnson said, is slow and awkward, and
is the only type of sign language Zinser could have learned in less
than six months. There are sign language symbols for each of the 26
characters in the English alphabet, and, when signers cannot find a
symbol for an English word, they may spell out the English word,
then return to sign. Fingerspelling is used in all three types of
sign.
   Gallaudet professors, 30 percent of whom are deaf, are required
to know sign language, and must pass sign examinations for
promotions or raises, according to Roger Beach, a counseling
professor who designed Gallaudet's exam program.

   The United Nations said Miss Hepburn will leave Monday on the
four-day visit, which will include stops at relief and
rehabilitation centers in the hardest-hit provinces of Tigray and
Eritrea. The trip ends Thursday at development projects in central
Shoa province, according to UNICEF.
   Total and near-total crop failures last year threaten an
estimated 7 million people with famine in northern Ethiopia, where
fighting between rebels and the nation's Marxist government has

   Former President Jimmy Carter is joining health
officials in a campaign to eradicate guinea worm disease, a
crippling parasitic affliction that plagues millions of Africans
and Asians.
   Carter will travel to Africa this week on a six-day,
three-nation visit to bolster efforts to wipe out the guinea worm,
which strikes 10 million people a year in developing countries.
   The World Health Organization voted in 1986 to make guinea worm
disease the next target for global eradication, following the
successful eradication of smallpox 11 years ago.
   Traveling with Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, will be Carter
Presidential Center Executive Director William Foege, who led the
smallpox effort while at the Centers for Disease Control. Also in
the party will be several staff members from the center and Global
2000, a policy institute under the auspices of the Carter Center.
   Guinea worms can grow to lengths of nearly 3 feet inside the
body. They do not themselves cause a fatal disease, but the painful
sores created when they break through skin can be crippling. Their
larvae are spread through contaminated drinking water.
   Fighting the disease involves improvements in water supply,
which can be costly for developing countries.

``Memories of a Coal Miner's Daughter,'' shows a coal car and its
track.
   The remaining four will be completed during the next two years,
said Miss Lynn, who was born and raised in Kentucky mining area.
   Her autobiography was made into a 1980 movie, ``Coal Miner's

   Chinese companies that want to sell their
products abroad are being given greater freedom to do so, the
government announced Saturday.
   The State Council, China's cabinet, said the nation will
introduce a contract system under which the power to handle most
import and export commodities will be transferred to local foreign
trade companies and certain well-managed industrial enterprises.
   Details of the new system were provided by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   It said areas and cities enjoying special status as foreign
trade centers will be able to sign contracts with the state
guaranteeing the state a certain amount of hard currency.
   After that they will be free to pursue international contracts
as they wish.
   Following introduction of the system, China will reduce
mandatory state quotas for exports and the number of state-handled
export commodities.
   National export and import corporations will handle only a small
amount of commodities. Instead, their branches will become
independent managerial entitites run by local governments.
   Xinhua said the new foreign trade structure encourages local
authorities and export-oriented enterprises to participate in
foreign trade.
   The report said China this year will also reform its foreign
exchange managerial structure. Local governments, enterprises and
institutions and foreign-funded businesses will be allowed to
exchange hard currency through government-run exchange centers.
   It said China's coastal areas will be encouraged to develop
export-oriented industries by expanding labor- and
expertise-intensive industries.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang has proposed significant
increases in the number of regions given preferential treatment in
developing foreign trade as a means of helping China make greater
inroads in world markets.
   The State Council urged local governments to accelerate the
introduction of the responsibility system _ making companies
responsible for profits and losses _ in foreign trade companies.
   China's foreign trade climbed 13 percent last year to about $80
billion. The reformist leaders in Beijing see foreign trade as a
critical factor in introducing technology and earning hard currency
for the nation's modernization drive.

<TEXT>
   A condemned man who insists he's
innocent and whose case has become a rallying cry for death penalty
opponents is seeking his seventh reprieve from the electric chair,
with just two days left before his scheduled execution.
   Willie Jasper Darden faces execution early Tuesday at Florida
State Prison near Starke for the September 1973 killing of
furniture store owner Carl Turman during a $15 robbery.
   ``Let me tell you something. Willie Darden is not a murderer!''
Darden, 54, told The Associated Press in a 1985 interview, a claim
that he has made to dozens of reporters who have interviewed him.
   Darden has received six stays of execution, more than any other
Florida inmate, and his case has attracted international attention,
with supporters saying he was a victim of racial prejudice at his
trial because he is black.
   Two witnesses say they have information to back up his story,
but their accounts were dismissed as mistaken and not new by the
lawyer who prosecuted Darden.
   ``There is no question he is guilty,'' Ray McDaniel, now a
Bartow attorney, said Friday in a telephone interview.
   McDaniel said he believed Darden will die Tuesday. ``I don't
think you will find a judge with the guts to issue a stay,'' he
said.
   ``I think it's time. I think it's about 12 years too late,''
McDaniel said, who added that Darden was linked, but never charged,
with other murders.
   Attorneys for the Office of Capital Collateral Review filed an
appeal Friday with the Florida Supreme Court.
   Darden's is one of the most-litigated cases involving a death
row inmate, with nearly 100 judges involved in decisions. It has
been before the U.S. Supreme Court four times already.
   McDaniel discounted the assertions of two people who repeated
claims Friday at an Amnesty International news conference in
Tallahassee that they believe Darden is innocent.
   The Rev. Sam Sparks, a Baptist minister, and Christine Bass, a
Lakeland secretary, said they had information they say might clear
Darden of the crime.
   ``I know Willie Darden is innocent. It is not a belief, it is a
knowledge,'' said Ms. Bass.
   Sparks said Turman's wife had told him that all blacks looked
alike to her and that her identification of Darden was unimportant
because lawyers had told her that Darden committed the crime. Helen
Baum, formerly Helen Turman, recently denied having made that
statement to Sparks and reaffirmed her identification of Darden as
the man who shot her husband.
   Ms. Bass said Darden's car was broken down near her home until a
tow truck arrived about 25 minutes before the robbery, eight miles
away.
   McDaniel said the two are mistaken about the times and that the
defense knew their claims at the time of the trial.
   Amnesty International officials have claimed Gov. Bob Martinez
is rushing to execute Darden for political reasons.
   The governor signed a seventh death warrant for Darden on March
8, just a day after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene,
and set his execution for Tuesday, giving Darden's attorneys less
than a week to prepare his case.
   ``I think what the governor is looking for some kind of
ritualistic sacrifice that he can go through to prove he's tough on
crime,'' said Magdaleno Rose-Avila, national director of Amnesty
International's campaign to abolish the death penalty. He noted
that the governor's popularity rating has been low in recent polls.
   When Martinez signed the sixth death warrant in Darden's case
earlier this year, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, American
actress Margot Kidder and British rock star Peter Gabriel urged
clemency for Darden. Sakharov won the 1975 Nobel Peace prize for
his defense of human rights in the Soviet Union.
   The governor's spokesman said politics had nothing to do with
the decision.
   ``International attention has no real bearing on whether a
legally imposed sentence that has been upheld by the courts should
be carried out,'' said press secretary Jon Peck.

<HEAD>Thousands Call For Waldheim Resignation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of protesters outside the
offices of President Kurt Waldheim on Saturday urged him to resign
and remembered the victims of Nazism 50 years after Adolf Hitler's
troops marched into Austria.
   Police estimated about 5,000 people attended despite pouring
rain and strong winds. The organizers estimated 10,000.
   The demonstration, called by more than a dozen well known
Austrian intellectuals, marked the March 1938 annexation of Austria
to Nazi Germany.
   One of several banners displayed said, ``Memorial year without
Waldheim.''
   Debate has surrounded the former U.N. secretary-general since
1986, when the first revelations surfaced about his service in the
German army in the Balkans during World War II.
   A panel of historians appointed by the Austrian government
issued a report last month that said he was ``in close proximity''
to some Nazi atrocities, knew they were going on and made no
attempt to prevent them.
   It also said Waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to
make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it.
   Demonstrators arrived Saturday by bus and train from across
Austria. Loudspeakers played a recording of Hitler's speech to
cheering masses on the adjoining square on March 15, 1938.
   Hundreds of thousand of Austrians welcomed the annexation, known
as the Anschluss, but others actively resisted it.
   Author Peter Turrini, one of several artists and intellectuals
who addressed the crowd, said Austrians had not yet done enough to
confront their wartime past.
   ``There has not yet been one minute of confession,'' he declared.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, speaking at the site of a former
prison camp for gypsies, said Austrians ``may not behave as (they
did) after 1945 ... when no one asked what hapened to the Austrians
who left the country in 1938.''
   At the demonstration before Waldheim's offices, Rosa Jochmann, a
former concentration camp inmate and resistance fighter, gave an
emotional speech that left many spectators weeping.
   She recalled that even people who were not directly responsible
for Nazi atrocities ``simply walked by'' acts of violence.
   ``It is not true that one should not mourn, one must,'' she
said. ``All those who lived through it (the Nazi period) must
speak. I will never be silent.''
   The organizers appealed for a minute of silence after the
speech. In contrast to Friday, when a nationwide minute of silence
was only sparsely observed, the entire square fell still.

<HEAD>Israeli Air Raid on PLO Bases Around Sidon</HEAD>

   Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian
guerrilla bases on the outskirts of Sidon on Saturday in apparent
retaliation for the killing of three Israelis aboard a hijacked bus
five days ago.
   Police said at least one guerrilla was killed and eight wounded
in the 10-minute raid.
   A police spokesman said four Israeli jets dive-bombed the bases
in four runs that began at 2:30 p.m.
   Black smoke billowed from the stricken targets at the villages
of Ashrafiyeh, Minyeh, Qraiyeh and Ein el-Dilb on the southern and
southeastern edges of Sidon, said the spokesman who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said guerrilla defenders opened up with twin-barreled
anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were reported.
   The stricken bases were manned by fighters from Fatah, the
mainline guerrilla group headed by Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, the spokesman said.
   An Israeli military communique said the planes struck in the
early afternoon at installations used by guerrillas to plan attacks
against targets inside Israel.
   It said the targets were demolished and all the planes returned
safely to base. It gave no other details.
   Ambulances, their sirens wailing, raced to the bombed villages
and evacuated casualties to hospitals in Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut.
   On Monday, in the latest attack inside Israel, Arab guerrillas
hijacked a commuter bus carrying workers from the Israeli Dimona
nuclear plant in southern Israel.
   Three Israeli civilians were killed and eight wounded in the
hijacking, which ended when Israeli troops stormed the vehicle.
Three Arab gunmen were killed in the shootout.
   Fatah, the largest PLO guerrilla faction, had claimed
responsibility for the hijacking.
   Saturday's air raid was the second such attack on Palestinian
targets in Lebanon this year.
   Twelve Israeli warplanes carried out a rare nighttime attack
Jan. 2 against bases manned by Fatah guerrillas and fighters of the
Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.
   Twenty-one people were killed and 30 wounded in that attack, six
weeks after a popular front guerrilla, flying a motorized
hang-glider, infiltrated from Lebanon and attacked an army base in
northern Israel.
   Six Israeli soldiers were killed and eight wounded before the
guerrilla was killed on Nov. 25.
   The Syria-backed group leads an anti-Arafat camp within the PLO.
It is headed by former Syrian army captain, Ahmad Jibril, and is
based in Damascus.

<HEAD>Maltese Player Recalls Horror Of Tripoli Stadium Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soccer player who witnessed a deadly stadium
collapse in the Libyan capital last week said he thought Tripoli
had been hit by an earthquake.
   ``Suddenly there was a rumble ... and then the bodies fell
down,'' Maltese player John Buttigieg told the Rome daily Il
Messaggero in an interview published Saturday.
   Part of the grandstand collapsed Thursday after some of the
60,000 spectators at the 75,000-seat June 11 Stadium panicked
because of a knife fight, according to reports.
   News reports from Malta and Yugoslavia said 20 people were
killed and that scores of people were injured. Radio Malta in a
report from Tripoli said at least 17 people died and that two
people were arrested.
   The reports conflicted with those from the Libyan news agency
JANA, which said two people were killed and 16 others were
hospitalized.
   Buttigieg said at first he ``screamed like a madman'' at his
team captain that it was an earthquake.
   ``The grandstand in front of me was coming down like a sand
castle and the fans ... fell by the tens, by the hundreds,''
Buttigieg was quoted as saying.
   ``Three years ago I saw on television the scene at Heysel, but
in Tripoli it was worse, much worse,'' he added, referring to the
May 1985 riot by English fans at Brussels' Heysel Stadium that
killed 39 people.
   ``After a part of the third tier of seats, the highest, fell on
the second tier, it was hell. There was a continuous scream ... I
saw people run toward the dead,'' he said.
   ``The referee told us to go into the dressing rooms. But we
couldn't. The entrance was blocked by bodies and pieces of
cement,'' he said.
   The Belgrade daily Politika Ekspres said the incident began when
several fans pulled out knives during a quarrel.
   Seeking shelter nearby, spectators toppled an iron fence. At the
same time, a 6-foot-thick, 15-foot-high wall crashed down, the
newspaper said.
   The paper said many people were injured when fans stampeded
toward the exits.
   ``People began to enter the field,'' said Buttigieg. ``They ran
toward the collapsed grandstand. Perhaps they wanted to help the
injured, but no, they wanted to fight. With whom, I do not know.''
   Politika Exspres said about 5,000 fans chased those who had
brandished weapons. One of them was caught, but police managed to
drag him free from the enraged crowd, it said.
   The Maltese paper L'Orizzont reported that Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi had planned to attend the match, which opened a
sports festival in Tripoli. However, at the last moment he changed
his mind and was represented at the match by a city official.
   The exhibition game was stopped in the 43rd minute and did not
resume.

   Mats and Margareta Johansson won a car
worth $10,000 on a TV game show, but the couple found out they may
have to pay $8,300 in taxes on the prize, a newspaper said Saturday.
   The newspaper Aftonbladet said the Johanssons took it for
granted that Ford Fiesta was a tax-free prize. They won it last
fall on the popular quiz game, ``The Card is Played,'' on Sweden's
publicly-owned television.
   The report said the couple was seeking exemption from tax on the
prize with the National Swedish Tax Board.
   Sweden's taxes are among the highest in the world and can take a
bite of 70 percent to 80 percent of earnings on an average salary.

<HEAD>Reagan Warns Congress He'll Veto Protectionist Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan warned House and Senate
negotiators Saturday he will veto a trade bill they are preparing
unless ``protectionist and defeatist'' provisions are eliminated.
   ``The conference committee working on the final draft of the
bill has already eliminated a number of troublesome provisions,
including illegal quotas, budget-busting giveaways and
protectionist measures,'' Reagan said from Camp David, Md., in his
weekly radio address.
   He added, however, that he opposes many remaining provisions,
and ``I'm hopeful within the next phase these will be jettisoned.
Only wholesale elimination of many of the existing items will
produce a bill I can sign.''
   The trade bill, a 1,000-page set of provisions that have been
worked on for three years, is currently the subject of negotiations
involving no fewer than 17 congressional committees.
   One of the casualties of the process has been a controversial,
House-passed amendment that would have required 10 percent annual
rollbacks in ``excess and unwarranted'' Japanese surpluses in trade
with this country.
   Reagan expressed a willingness to work with Congress to produce
a bill he could sign.
   ``A protectionist trade bill is a serious threat to our export
boom,'' Reagan said. ``It's a serious threat to the millions of
American jobs that depend upon international trade. It is filled
with scores of provisions that are protectionist and defeatist.''
   ``My veto pen is ready if the final bill remains anti-trade,
anti-consumer, anti-jobs and anti-growth,'' he said.
   With an improvement in trade in recent months, he said, a
protectionist trade bill ``would be like closing the barn door just
when the horse is trying to get back in.''
   Much of the recent narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit has been
credited to a decline in the value of the dollar against foreign
currencies, making American goods less expensive overseas.
   Reagan said, however, that since the third quarter of 1986, the
merchandise trade deficit in real terms has declined 18 percent and
the volume of exports has grown four times as fast as the volume of
imports in the past 15 months.
   ``Adopting protectionist measures and starting trade wars now
would be like closing the barn door just as the horses tried to get
back in,'' he said.
   Lawmakers have said they want to have the bill ready by Easter.
In recent weeks, quotas on lamb imports and payments to sugar
refiners hurt by imports have been stripped from the legislation by
the Senate conferees.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., in his party's weekly radio speech,
said Reagan's upbeat comments about exports ``hides our trade
deficit problem _ staggering figures which are monthly reminders
that America is not the economic power that it was.''
   The 1987 trade deficit was about $170 billion.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address, delivered Saturday from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, I'd like to talk to you today about our
nation's trade policy. I can't think of a recent economic issue
that has generated more heat and less light, yet has more
importance to our long-term national interest than trade.
   Throughout the seven years I've been in office, professional
doom sayers have latched onto one issue after another as evidence
of an American decline. They can't seem to acknowledge the obvious
good news that surrounds us _ the low inflation, the over 15
million new jobs since November 1982, and the longest peacetime
economic expansion of the century.
   Trade is only the most recent subject of lamentation by our
critics. For them our trade deficit is an excuse for getting the
government more involved in in private business. They say that
Americans can't compete with foreign workers, so we should slow
imports by erecting protectionist trade barriers.
   As usual the doom merchants are wrong. The U.S. economy remains
the most dynamic and exciting one on the globe. Our entrepreneurs,
our can-do spirit and our economic freedom are the envy of the
world. The pessimism used to justify protectionism is totally
unfounded. Let's clear up a few myths.
   First, the trade situation is improving far more quickly than
people realize. Economists may disagree on the impact of the trade
imbalance, but there is no disagreement that there has been a
remarkable turnaround in the real trade deficit.
   Since the third quarter of 1986, the merchandise trade deficit
in real terms has declined 18 percent, and over the past 15 months,
the volume of exports has grown over four-times as fast as the
volume of imports. Clearly we are in an export boom. American
industries, particularly manufacturers are setting records.
   Unfortunately there's a threat to all this good news. I'm
talking about the trade bill pending in Congress. Adopting
protectionist measures and starting trade wars now would be like
closing the barn door just as the horses tried to get back in. The
best way to keep our exports growing is to keep international trade
expanding, and that brings me to another myth _ that Congress can
pass a law that will reduce the trade deficit without destroying
our prosperity. Legislation can reduce a trade deficit only if it
reduces economic activity. If people are not working, they're not
trading. We had a trade surplus and 25 percent unemployment in the
Great Depression.
   A protectionist trade bill is a serious threat to our export
boom. It's a serious threat to the millions of American jobs that
depend upon international trade. It is filled with scores of
provisions that are protectionist and defeatist. My veto pen is
ready if the final bill remains anti-trade, anti-consumer,
anti-jobs and anti-growth. However, the administration is willing
to work diligently with Congress to produce a bill that would
increase our international competitiveness and complement our
efforts to promote trade, exports, jobs and productivity, not
stymie them.
   All those working on the bill should take a deep breath, take
another look at the trade outlet and work together in a
constructive spirit. It is still possible to write a bill that I
can sign.
   Indeed, I am encouraged by reports on the status of the trade
bill negotiations. The conference committee working on the final
draft of the bill has already eliminated a number of troublesome
provisions, including illegal quotas, budget-busting giveaways and
protectionist measures. Many objectionable provisions remain,
including procedural changes in the law. But I'm hopeful within the
next phase these will be jettisoned. Only wholesale elimination of
many of the existing items will produce a bill I can sign.
   Regardless of whether I sign trade legislation this year, we
will continue our free and fair approach to trade policy. We will
challenge unfair trade practices of other countries in order to
achieve a level playing field for American industries. We will
negotiate to knock down trade barriers on a bilateral or
multilateral basis. In that regard, we will seek early enactment of
the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and push for concrete progress
in the upcoming Uruguay round of trade negotiations.
   Finally, we will continue to coordinate economic policies with
our major trading partners, thereby helping to maintain a favorable
international climate for trade expansion. America's open market is
its great strength, not its weakness. International trade has
helped bring unparalleled prosperity to the American people. It
would be a tragic mistake to surrender to doubt and defeatism, just
when our prospects are looking so bright. I have confidence in
America, and I'm sure you do, too.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   In an atmosphere of deepening crisis,
Panama's leaders met again Saturday to figure out how to pay the
130,000 public employees whose salaries come due early this week.
   With its treasury virtually empty, the government reportedly was
considering delaying or reducing the semi-monthly paychecks of the
workers who have been among its staunchest supporters.
   Panama's new chief of state, Manuel Solis Palma, and his Cabinet
have been meeting almost constantly since Thursday evening in an
effort to solve the problem, which could have strong political
repercussions.
   It became even more critical Friday when the Reagan
Administration in Washington announced new economic sanctions
against Panama, including the withholding of $6.5 million in
monthly Panama Canal fees.
   The sanctions were meant to force the ouster of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who has ruled Panama since 1983 as head of its
Defense Forces. He is under indictment in the United States on drug
smuggling and money laundering charges.
   With Solis Palma and the foreign minister, Jorge Abadia, tied up
in the emergency economic meetings, the government Saturday still
had not responded formally to the punitive measures taken in
Washington.
   But Boris Moreno, head of the government's National Information
Office, referred to the sanctions as ``economic aggression'' and an
``outrage'' and said they had created a virtual ``state of war.''
   ``This means that if the United States government does not like
the government of another country, it can withhold any funds
deposited in the United States,'' he said.
   Panama uses the U.S. dollar as its currency and even before the
latest sanctions were announced Washington had halted normal
transfers of funds from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Other monies on
deposit by Panama in private U.S. banks also have been tied up by
legal actions.
   Panama's 118 local and foreign banks were ordered closed until
further notice on March 3 because the government could not provide
enough money to cover withdrawals. Most had already shut down or
were operating on a limited basis because of a run on deposits that
began late last month.
   The bank closure left thousands of people and businesses holding
checks they could not cash. In the absence of cash, most people
were hoarding the dollars they had and many businessmen said they
were working out barter deals with suppliers and customers.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, the deposed president whose ouster last
month sparked the current crisis, predicted earlier this week that
the government's inability to pay its employees would ``add a new
political dimension'' to the problem.
   Delvalle made the statement from hiding. He has not been seen in
public since shortly after Noriega engineered his ouster in a
thinly disguised coup that came only hours after he tried to
dismiss the general. The United States still recognizes Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
response, by Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, to President
Reagan's radio address on Saturday:
   In one respect, the president has done our country a great
service. In 1981, when he took office, we were not feeling good
about ourselves. There was the Iran-hostage crisis, there was
runaway inflation.
   By 1984, the president's rhetoric had helped us to feel proud of
America once again. And that good feeling hit its height in the
summer of 1984 at the Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The
president had reminded all Americans that we are a proud people.
   But now that ``feel-good'' rhetoric is becoming a problem in
itself. The president insists that the economy is in great shape,
and that America has never been better off. But the truth is, that
we have seen feel-good rhetoric used to paper over the very real
problems that challenge our country. And that's not the way
Americans work.
   As Americans, we pride ourselves in solving our problems, not in
papering them over. The real issue that the President's feel-good
rhetoric ignores is what kind of America are we leaving for our
children. What standard of living will our children have? Will they
realize the American Dream the way that we've been able to? Will
our children ever be as well off as we have been?
   The President's rhetoric hides the fact that wage rates today
are below what they were 15 years ago. It hides the fact that the
new service sector jobs that have been created pay about half as
much as the manufacturing jobs they replace. It hides the fact that
both parents in most of America's young families have to work, and
they have to work whether there are young children to take care of
or not.
   It hides the fact that fewer and fewer young American families
can afford to buy their own house today. And it hides the fact that
the wages of our young families make it virtually impossible for
them to save _ save for hard times, save for a down payment on a
house, or save for their children's education.
   The President's rhetoric also hides our trade deficit problem _
staggering figures, which are monthly reminders that America is not
the economic power that we once were. It hides the fact that during
this administration, as a country we have added $1.5 trillion to
the national debt. That means that in 1989, we will spend more on
interest payments in the national debt than on the total combined
budgets of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education,
Energy, Interior, Labor and Justice.
   These interest payments consume precious funds which will not be
spent on rebuilding America's economic power, and will not be spent
on educating our children.
   Mr. President, you have reminded us that we are a great country
and that we are proud to be Americans. But we are now ready to get
to work solving some of those very real problems that exist. It
does not help to pretend that the problems don't exist.
   It does not help to stay the course when the course has taken us
into the ditch. We're ready to invest the time, money and energy in
revitalizing the American economy. We're ready to fight unfair
trade practices.
   We're ready to create new jobs which pay more than the ones that
they replace. We're ready to make specific investments in education
and retraining of our workers, in new research and development, and
in the commercialization of new technologies. And we're also ready
to reverse our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.
Also we're ready to invest the time, money and energy in the
education of our children.
   Instead of lecturing our children's teachers, we're ready to do
our part to help make our educational system work, work better and
work harder. We're ready to do what has to be done to prepare our
children to take the good jobs that this country can create in an
economic revitalization program. Mr. President, feeling good and
staying the course just are not doing the job.
   A proud America means an America that can recognize its
challenges and meet those challenges head-on. Only if we do so will
our children be as proud to be Americans 20 years from now as we
are today. This is U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman. Thank you for listening.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some hunters develop stuffy noses, wheezing
and hives around deer in what one researcher calls a case of
``Bambi strikes back,'' and some people are literally allergic to
exercise, scientists have found.
   Research also shows that cockroaches often prompt asthmatics to
wheeze, while fleas make others sneeze, the scientists say.
   Their studies of unusual, often unrecognized and potentially
deadly allergies are being presented during the American Academy of
Allergy and Immunology's annual meeting, which opened Friday and
ends Wednesday.
   The prevalence of such allergies is unknown, but the studies
suggest they probably are more common than once thought, especially
among people with common allergies, such as sensitivity to pollens,
household dust and foods such as peanuts and shellfish.
   ``There's all kind of weird triggers to allergies,'' said Dr.
Robert K. Bush, a University of Wisconsin allergist and chief of
allergy at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Madison. Bush
co-authored the study of 12 deer-sensitive Wisconsin hunters with
Dr. David Schroeckenstein.
   ``This may not be real common,'' Bush said of the hunters' deer
dilemma. ``But there are certainly a lot of people who get exposed
to these animals, and the potential is there for them to become
allergic.''
   Most of the hunters suffered congestion, hives, asthma,
sneezing, runny noses, itchy eyes, and swollen eyelids and lips
after inhaling deer hair or touching the animals' hair, saliva,
blood or urine. One was a state ``deer checker'' who went into
allergic shock after cutting his hand on a tag he placed on a deer.
The man recovered.
   ``Poor Bambi gets shot. Then Bambi strikes back. That's a good
headline,'' Bush said.
   The allergy academy's president, Dr. Albert Sheffer of Harvard
University Medical School, co-authored the largest study to date of
exercise-induced allergic shock, which was first recognized in 1969
and is ``characterized by hives, choking and-or a life-threatening
drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.''
   Sheffer concluded that while the condition is rare, ``it's the
most common physical allergy,'' even more common than hives induced
by heat or cold.
   The study, outlined Saturday by Harvard's Dr. John Wade,
analyzed a group of 199 people who develop allergic shock, called
anaphylaxis, when they exercise.
   Jogging prompted shock in 71 percent of the patients, aerobics
in 38 percent, dancing in 26 percent and swimming in 17 percent.
Many were allergic to certain foods, pollen, cat dander, aspirin
and other painkillers.
   The cause of exercise allergy is unknown. While exercise-induced
shock is life-threatening, ``we don't have any evidence anybody
died from it,'' Sheffer said.
   Dr. Bann Kang, head of the allergy section at the University of
Kentucky Medical Center in Lexington, said her study of 680
asthmatics in Chicago found 283 of them were allergic to body
parts, eggs and feces of cockroaches in house dust, an allergy
first identified in New York in 1967.
   ``They usually have very severe, intractable asthma,'' she said.
``They have attacks all the time.''
   Because many doctors don't recognize cockroach asthma, they only
treat symptoms, then ``send the patient back home, where the home
is filled with material that may induce asthma attacks again,''
Kang said.
   While flea bites are known to cause hives, a new study revealed
fleas' body parts inhaled from house dust also trigger allergic
reactions, said the study's author, research associate Walter
Trudeau of the University of South Florida School of Medicine and
the Veterans Administration Hospital in Tampa.
   Trudeau's study found 18 of 100 consecutive patients treated at
an allergy clinic for other allergies also were allergic to fleas
that invaded their homes aboard their cats or dogs.
   Desensitization injections can eliminate allergies to pollens,
house dust and cockroaches, but there is no effective serum to
desensitize people allergic to deer, fleas or exercise, the
researchers said.
   People allergic to fleas should get rid of their pets, or at
least exterminate the fleas, Trudeau said. Hunters allergic to deer
should stop hunting if necessary, Bush said.
   People prone to develop exercise-induced allergic shock ``should
not exercise for at least four to six hours after eating,'' since
exercise allergy often causes symptoms only if allergenic foods
were consumed, Sheffer said.

<HEAD>Judge Grounds Air Panama in U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has grounded Air Panama's U.S.
operations, freezing the company's assets while he decides which
leader of Panama should control the government-owned airline.
   ``Basically the airline is out of service,'' said Mark Cohen,
the Miami attorney who sued to seize Air Panama's assets on behalf
of Eric Delvalle, Panama's president-in-hiding.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Friday issued a 10-day
restraining order freezing the airline's assets while he considers
which Panamanian government should control the company _ Delvalle
or ruling military stongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega was indicted last month on drug trafficking charges by
federal grand juries in Tampa and Miami. Soon afterward, Delvalle
ordered Noriega to resign, but the Panamanian assembly backed
Noriega and ousted Delvalle.
   Each man contends he is Panama's legitimate ruler; the United
States recognizes only Delvalle's claim.
   Attorneys for Air Panama did not attend the hearing but
responded to Hoeveler's questions by telephone.
   An Air Panama reservations clerk in Miami said Saturday that no
Air Panama officials would be available until Monday.
   Air Panama's assets in the United States include two Boeing 727
jets, ground equipment and facilities, tickets that can be
exchanged for cash and an undetermined amount of money in U.S.
banks, Cohen said.
   Peter Reaveley, head of the Aviation Development Department at
Miami International Airport, said curtailment of Air Panama service
should not have much of an impact on travel to the Central American
nation.
   ``Business and tourist travel to Panama has already been drying
up,'' he said.
   Air Panama has been flying once daily from Miami to Panama City.
Eastern Airlines and Pan American Airways also have daily service
there.

   Florence Ann Felton doesn't monkey
around when there is a baby beast in need at her husband's zoo _
she takes the critters home.
   Felton, whose husband George Felton is the director of the
Greater Baton Rouge Zoo, can't bear it when the animals become
orphaned or rejected by their natural mothers. ``I love them,'' she
said of her furry patients.
   ``The babies, though, are exotic _ wild. They do not make good
pets,'' Mrs. Felton said.
   ``I've raised them on bottles, but I know they have to go
back,'' she said.
   ``The main problem is getting them on a bottle,'' she added.
``Once they're on a bottle, it's no problem.''
   The Feltons live near the zoo in a home that has been modified
for easy care of baby animals.
   They have raised chimps, bears, cougars, otters, leopards,
jaguars, small deer, antelope and other hoofed stock, baboons,
monkeys, lions, and tigers.
   Baby beasts must be fed every two hours, with feedings spread
out gradually. Mrs. Felton said animal babies got her up more often
during the night than did her own children, all of whom are now on
their own.
   Do the animals ever remember her?
   Some do, she said. Two young cougars she once helped raise would
stand up at the zoo with their paws on the wire, trying to get her
to scratch their noses.

   Ashland women deny they are ladies of
leisure, despite a recent report saying there are fewer of them in
work force than anywhere else in the country.
   The 1988 Congressional District Fact Book said only 31.6 percent
of the northeastern Kentucky women are employed, while the national
average for working women was 54.7 percent in 1986.
   But some members of the American Business Women's Association in
Ashland dispute the finding.
   ``I've got three daughters and two daughters-in-law and they all
work,'' said Margaret Moore. ``I've worked all my life. All the
women I know work.''
   Helen Hunt, vice president of the association, said she doesn't
think Ashland is much different than any other area.
   ``Usually women can find work here quicker than men,'' she said.
   On the other hand, Prince Georges County, Md. topped the list of
working women with 62.6 percent; Arlington, Va., was second with
62.2 percent, and Bloomington, Minn., ranked third at 62.2 percent,
the book said.
   Ranking slightly above Ashland are Huntington, W.Va., 31.9
percent; Washington, Pa., 36.2 percent, and the economically
depressed South Bronx section of New York City, 36.5 percent, the
book said.
   The book was published by the Joint Center for Political
Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank, which used U.S. Census
data to determine its rankings.
   One explanation for the small percentage of working women in
Ashland might be that males traditionally have held the high-paying
jobs at large local employers such as Ashland Oil and Armco Inc.
   ``Perhaps it wasn't necessary for women to work in some
situations,'' said Mike Sturm, employment and training program
supervisor with the Kentucky Department of Employment Services in
Ashland.

<HEAD>Chicago Tribune Endorses Gore In Illinois Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Tribune endorsed Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore in Tuesday's Illinois presidential primary, passing
over homestate candidates Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson.
   The Tribune endorsement in Sunday editions called Gore ``an
underdog with sound judgment and an important message.''
   The Chicago Sun-Times, the state's second largest newspaper
after the Tribune, has endorsed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
in the Democratic race and Vice President George Bush in the
Republican primary.
   ``The endorsement is offered in the same spirit as our earlier
endorsement of Sen. Robert Dole in the Republican primary _ in
hopes that an underdog with sound judgment and an important message
can pick up momentum in Illinois and contest his party's nomination
all the way to its convention,'' said the Tribune editorial.
   The Tribune conducted a poll for Sunday's editions that showed
Simon was favored by 35 percent of those surveyed, Jackson 30
percent and Dukakis 18 percent. Gore and Gephardt had a combined
total of about 10 percent.
   Among the likely Republican voters, Bush was supported by 62
percent and Dole by 28 percent. Robertson was the first choice of
only 6 percent.
   The survey, conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates,
contacted 504 Republicans and 501 Democrats on Wednesday and
Thursday and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
   The Tribune endorsement said Gore was the only candidate who
could ``prevent the Democatic debate from winding down into the
staid pronouncements of ... Dukakis .... and the jazzier echo of
the class-conscious Mr. Jackson.''
   The Tribune gave Gore high marks on his knowledge of domestic
and foreign affairs and also warned the Democratic Party it needed
``a strong Gore candidacy just to avoid a repeat in November of its
1980 and 1984 humiliations.''
   Dukakis leads in the race for delegates to the party's national
nominating convention, followed by Jackson and Gore. Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt is fourth and Simon is last, although there are
more uncommitted delegates than Simon and Gephardt have together.

<HEAD>Lung Association: Lung Disease Top Preventable Cause of
Job-Related Illness</HEAD>
<NOTE>For release at 6 p.m. EST, time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 65,000 Americans a year develop lung
diseases from on-the-job causes, making lung disease the most
common preventable cause of job-related illness and death in the
country, the American Lung Association said Saturday.
   Long-term exposure to cancer-causing substances in the
workplace, for example, is blamed for about 16,000 lung cancer
deaths a year, the association said in its 1987 annual report.
   That is about 12 percent of the nation's total lung cancer
deaths last year, the association said.
   Among the workplace substances that cause lung cancer are
arsenic, a hazard in the oil refining, smelting and mining
industries; asbestos, in asbestos milling and manufacture,
insulation and shipyard work; chromium, used in glassmaking,
potting and battery making; nickel, in nickel refining, and
petroleum products and oils, the association said.
   Not everyone in those industries is exposed to those substances,
however, the association noted.
   Other job-related lung diseases include chronic bronchitis, a
stiffening of lung tissue called pulmonary fibrosis and industrial
asthma, the association said.
   On other topics, the annual report said smokers who kick the
habit have to wait 10 years or more before their risk of lung
cancer falls to about that of people who have never smoked.
   But that should not discourage smokers from quitting, because
quitting causes an immediate and dramatic plunge in the risk of
other diseases, especially emphysema and chronic bronchitis, the
report says.
   The report also calls lung cancer statistics on blacks
``horrendous,'' resulting from higher percentages of smokers among
black men and women than among whites.
   In 1985, about 41 percent of black men aged 20 and older smoked,
compared to about 32 percent for white men, while about 32 percent
of black women smoked, compared to 28 percent of white women, the
association said.
   From 1973 to 1984, the lung cancer death rate among black men
rose 25 percent, from 64.3 deaths per 100,000 population to 80.3,
three times faster than the rate among white men, the association
said in a separate statement.
   For black women the death rate nearly doubled, from 11.9 per
100,000 population to 20.4, the association said.

   A man waving a pistol rushed the
cockpit of a passenger jet Saturday and demanded the pilot fly him
to India or Afghanistan, then shot a guard three times before
passengers pummeled and subdued him.
   The Pakistan International Airlines jet was carrying 143
passengers and 13 crew members on a domestic flight from Karachi to
Quetta when the attempted hijacking took place about seven minutes
before landing, said APP, the Pakistani national news agency.
   The hijacker also reportedly suffered a gunshot wound during the
scuffle with the guard and passengers. There were no other injuries
and the aircraft landed safely, the news agency said.
   The news agency said a man identified as Mannan Achakzai, 28,
from the Baluchistan province was arrested. It said two other
passengers also were detained as suspected accomplices, but had no
details.
   The plane, an A-300 Airbus, was preparing to land at Quetta in
Baluchistan, near the Afghan border in western Pakistan.
   APP said a man from the first-class section apparently went to
the bathroom, then returned shortly afterward with a revolver and
rushed toward the the cockpit.
   The gunmen shouted at the pilot to divert the aircraft to either
the Afghan capital of Kabul or to New Delhi, APP said. It gave no
information on the gunman's motive.
   A guard on the aircraft, Liaquat Ali, tried to overpower the
gunman but was shot three times in the back.
   Two passengers ``jumped on the hijacker and unleashed a volley
of blows and punches,'' APP said. Officials identified the two
passengers as provincial government ministers Masir Mengal and
Mohammad Rind.
   An airport official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that Achakzai was wounded by a bullet fired from his own revolver
during the scuffle.
   Two doctors, one Pakistani and one Dutch, were on board the
plane and administered aid to the guard and gunmen, APP said.
   ``It was a miracle that the air guard survived although he was
hit thrice,'' Dr. Louis Koster, a Dutch physician who was on board
the flight, was quoted as saying. ``Fortunately, none of the
bullets could pierce through any vital organ.''
   Airport security is extremely heavy in Pakistan and airport
officials could not explain how the gun was brought on board.
Passengers must pass through two metal detectors and have their
carry-on luggage inspected at least three times before boarding.

   South Carolina uses a three-step process of caucuses and
conventions for picking its delegates to the Democratic National
Convention.
   Precinct caucuses on March 12 pick delegates to the county
conventions later in the month, which name delegates to the state
convention on April 16. Partricipants at each step of the process
will be divided according to presidential preferences and are
pledged from one level to the next.
   Twenty-nine pledged national convention delegates from
congressional districts will be chosen and allocated in
congressional district caucuses at the state convention. The rest
of the state's 15 pledged national convention delegates will be
chosen at the state convention and will be allocated among
presidential candidates in proportion to presidential preference
expressed by state convention delegates.

   Tibetan women set fire to a Chinese flag
and demanded freedom for their homeland on Saturday, vowing to
return to the region they fled nearly three decades ago.
   In London, about 50 Tibetan demonstrators protested outside the
Chinese Embassy. There was no response from the embassy and police
maintained a discreet watch on the demonstrators, who ended their
vigil without incident.
   In Switzerland, about 400 Tibetans carried banners that said
``China Out of Tibet,'' and ``Long Live the Dalai Lama'' on a
peaceful march through Zurich's inner city.
   About 150 Tibetan refugees participated in the New Delhi
demonstration, one of the latest last week to mark the 29th
anniversary of an unsuccessful uprising against Chinese rule in the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   ``The pride and might of Communist China will not crush the
spirit of Tibetan nationalism,'' the Tibetan Women's Organization,
which organized the New Delhi protest, said in statement.
   Indian policewomen stood by and watched the Tibetan women burn
the red flag of China near Parliament.
   Tsewang Topgyal, a spokesman for the demonstrators, fled his
country at the age of 5 in the wake of the violent revolt in 1959.
He said ``this anniversary is like Christmas for Tibetans. It is a
time when we remember family and friends at home.
   ``There are few Tibetans who have not lost members of their
immediate family due to the Chinese presence there,'' he said.
   On March 10, 1959, Tibetans revolted against their Chinese
rulers, who responded with a brutal crackdown. India is the home of
at least 100,000 Tibetan refugees who fled Tibet along with their
leader, the Dalai Lama.
   The anniversary of the Tibetan revolt coincides with an upsurge
in anti-Chinese rioting in Lhasa.
   An official report said one policeman was killed in daylong
clashes March 5 between police and protesters in Lhasa, but
unconfirmed reports put casualties at 21 Tibetans and three police
killed.
   During three independence protests in September and October, at
least 14 people were killed and dozens arrested.

<HEAD>Experts: World Birthrate Will Finally Stop Growing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLOIRES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's birthrate will begin
declining within the next 12 years for the first time in recorded
history, a group of development experts said Saturday.
   ``This will be a momentous occasion in the history of the
world,'' said Dr. William Foege, director of the Task Force for
Child Survival and former head of the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta.
   Scientists attending the task force's three-day international
symposium here agreed that new projections from developing
countries show that the birthrate should stop growing nearly a half
century earlier than demographers previously thought possible.
   That would be followed by the stabilization of the entire
population, said Foege, an epidemiologist who conducted the
birthrate study. The birthrate is the number of births per 1,000
population.
   Dr. Kenneth Warren, a vaccines expert and head of the health
unit of the Rockefeller Foundation, said: ``People have considered
that world population growth would continue indefinitely. The
question has been, is man going to overrun and destroy the whole
planet? It's something people have been despairing about.''
   The Task Force for Child Survival is a coalition that includes
UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, the World Health Organization,
more than a dozen international aid agencies and doctors and health
ministers from 11 developing countries.
   The organizations have been working on an international campaign
to immunize children against polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis and
other diseases in a project aimed primarily at developing nations.
   The common perception that low infant mortality causes
population increases is apparently incorrect, said Warren.
   Actually, a low death rate for infants actually causes
populations to stabilize. Industrialized countries such as the
United States have relatively low birthrates.
   Experts at the conference said Asian and Latin American
countries now are following this trend. An increasing number of
countries are weighing in with lower birth rates.
   The experts said women in poor countries are likely to have
larger families to offset the loss of children to disease.
   Foege, using data from the World Bank, examined trends in infant
mortality and birthrates from 1960 to the present and projected
infant mortality by nation through 2000.
   ``If we're wrong, we're only wrong by a few years, the concept
isn't wrong,'' Foege said, adding that his predictions of the
anticipated drop int he birthrate could have an error margin of
five years.
   Previous predictions have indicated that the birthrate would
stabilize midway through the next century, when the population
reaches about 13 billion.
   If Foege's projections are correct, the population would stop
growing at about the year 2150.
   Because of increased life expectancy and other factors, the
population level will take at least several decades to level off
after the birthrate stops growing.
   ``There's full agreement on the prediction,'' said James P.
Grant, executive director of UNICEF. ``With the kinds of
improvements in survival we've been talking about at this meeting,
the decline could come even sooner.''
   The birthrate prediction made at on the last day of the
symposium was part of an optimistic appraisal of the progress made
in improving health care and the potential to extend life for
children worldwide.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration, at the
invitation of Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, has been assisting an
offensive aimed at South American cocaine-processing facilities and
growing areas that was first tried with U.S. military troops amid
much controversy in 1986.
   Under the initiative, DEA officials say, specially trained U.S.
drug agents with the assistance of aircraft from the agency are
accompanying Bolivian military forces into the jungles of that
country and locating cocaine processing laboratories, which are
then dismantled by the troops.
   The effort, begun last year, is a continuation and broadening of
Operation Blast Furnace in 1986, DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty
said. In Blast Furnace, 170 U.S. Army personnel raided about 20
drug lab sites in Bolivia. The injection of U.S. troops drew
criticism from civil liberties groups concerned about the use of
the military to enforce civilian laws.
   The new operation doesn't involve U.S. military personnel.
   ``We're working with the governments in the primary coca-growing
countries of Peru and Bolivia, where they are using their troops
and we are sending along DEA advisers as intelligence experts,''
Dougherty said.
   The agents have undergone extensive training in weapons,
language and jungle survival, in addition to the regular 14 weeks
of field training DEA agents take. The jungle survival training is
given by the U.S. Army special forces, the Green Berets.
   As part of the effort, DEA planes outfitted with sophisticated
electronic gear are being used for aerial reconnaissance to
identify drug labs.
   In Peru, DEA agents began in mid-1987 to help immobilize and
disrupt the flow of cocaine products from the principal area of
that country where illicit coca is cultivated, the Upper Huallaga
Valley. Extensive production of coca paste and cocaine base also
takes place there, David L. Westrate, assistant DEA administrator
for operations, said in congressional testimony earlier this month.
   Partly as a result of the effort, there have been substantial
seizures of coca leaves, cocaine base and chemicals used in
producing coca paste and base, Westrate said.
   Under an agreement made in 1987 with Bolivia, DEA agents helped
the government there locate and destroy numerous coca processing
facilities. A total of 26 labs for producing coca base or refining
it were seized last year in Bolivia, Westrate said.
   DEA agents also are taking a more active role in Ecuador, a
transit country for large amounts of chemicals used in processing
cocaine in other South American countries, DEA officials said. Most
of the coca paste produced in Ecuador is transported to Colombia
for conversion to cocaine hydrochloride.

   Iraq said Saturday its jets hit a tanker
in the Persian Gulf and an oil pumping station on the Iranian
mainland, indicating a return of hostilities to economic targets
during a truce in the ``war of the cities.''
   But Iran later accused Iraq of violating the truce by sending a
warplane to bomb the town of Gachsaran in southwestern Iran.
   Tehran Television, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a spokesman for
the War Information Headquarters as saying the plane was ``forced
to flee under heavy anti-aircraft fire.''
   He said the aircraft was seen ``dropping it bombs out of
frustration in a desert area.''
   The unidentified spokesman said the incident ``indicates Iraq
wants to continue its acts of mischief, and the Islamic combatants
will not remain silent if civilian targets are attacked again.''
Iraq did not comment on the report.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
earlier reported that Revolutionary Guards attacked and set ablaze
the offshore Al-Amaya radar facility in the northern tip of the
gulf Friday night.
   Al-Amaya had been transformed by the Iraqis from an oil platform
to monitor activity in the gulf. IRNA said surface-to-air and
shore-to-sea missile pads on the facility were destroyed in the
attack.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Cyprus,
reported that Iraqi warplanes blasted the Imam Hassan oil pumping
station in southwestern Iran Saturday afternoon.
   The agency quoted an unidentified Iraqi military spokesman as
saying the facility was ``totally destroyed.''
   In an earlier dispatch, Iraq reported to have struck a ``very
large maritime target'' off the Iranian coast Friday night. The
attack was not independently verified by gulf-based shipping
executives.
   INA quoted a military spokesman as saying the Iraqi warplanes
scored ``an accurate and effective hit'' on the vessel, and
returned safely.
   It quoted a spokesman as saying the raids reflected Iraq's
``determination to destroy Iran's economic lifeline and deprive the
enemy of revenues employed to finance aggression.''
   The cease-fire in the ``war of the cities'' passed the 24-hour
mark, with no attacks on each other's capitals or major population
centers.
   Hundreds of civilian casualties were reported in the
unprecedented 12-day duel. Iraq claimed to have hurled 71
long-range missiles into Tehran and two other cities and Iran said
it fired 29 missiles at Iraqi cities.
   The barrage ended Friday afternoon after Iraq fired eight
rockets at Tehran and three at the holy city of Qom, the last one
just 16 minutes before the 4 p.m. truce deadline.
   Iraq had made its right to fire the last shot a precondition for
the truce, on grounds that Iran, the ``aggressive party,'' had
triggered the exchange.
   Iraq's terms for the cease-fire also stipulated that Tehran not
attempt to launch a ground offensive against any Iraqi population
centers.
   It did not bar either side from continuing to attack military or
economically strategic targets.
   Ali Ahani, director general of European and American affairs of
Iran's Foreign Ministry, speaking in the Hague, Netherlands, said
Iran will unleash a new battlefront offensive against Iraq in
response to the missile attacks.
   ``We are going to give a decisive response in the war of the
fronts because of this bloodshed,'' he said, refusing to provide
specifics on the offensive.
   Baghdad's officially controlled press called the cease-fire a
triumph and warned Iran against resuming the bombardment, INA said.
   Al-Thawra, voice of Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party,
said the missile war taught the ``charlatans of Iran'' a ``painful,
bitter lesson.'' It said any Iranian ``violation'' of the
cease-fire ``would, for sure, generate a devastating Iraqi reply.''
   Iraq had vowed to disrupt oil exports by which Iran finances its
share of the 7{-year-old war. The attacks concentrate on Iran's
government-owned or chartered tankers that shuttle oil from Kharg
Island in the northern gulf to centers in safer waters near the
Strait of Hormuz.
   Iraq broke a three-week lull in the ``tanker war'' on Wednesday,
when its warplanes struck the 41,195-ton Maltese-flag tanker
Tenacity.
   Baghdad reported another attack on Friday, which like the one it
claimed on Saturday, could not be confirmed.
   The Iranians retaliate for Iraqi raids with attacks on neutral
commercial shipping. Although gulf radio monitors say Iranian
gunboats were actively challenging ships in the southern gulf in
recent days, there have been no attacks since Feb. 11.
   Indications arose of a new potential threat to shipping in the
southern gulf, where Iran was reported by U.S. military sources to
be building launch pads for its Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship
missiles on Abu Musa, a tiny island used as a base by Iran's
Revolutionary Guards.
   The Washington-based sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said American intelligence had detected no sign of
actual missiles being installed.
   Positioning the weapons, which have a range of 50 miles on Abu
Musa would extend the so-called ``Silkworm envelope'' by about 100
miles into the gulf, embracing the busy United Arab Emirates cities
of Dubai, Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah.

   Thousands of soccer fans Saturday
stampeded into locked stadium exits to escape a sudden hailstorm,
killing at least 93 in the crush, witnesses and hospital sources
said.
   Gumball-sized ice pellets rained down on the 30,000 fans
watching a match between Nepalese and Bangladeshi teams at the
National Stadium. Eyewitnesses said screaming spectators rushed to
the stadium's eight exits but found only one open.
   Police and hospital sources in the city confirmed more than 70
people, including two police officers, were trampled to death or
suffocated. Government television reported 73 people were killed,
and witnesses said another 20 bodies left at the stadium were later
retrieved by relatives.
   More than 100 people were hospitalized with injuries. Hospital
sources said 12 were in serious condition. Many more were were
treated and released.
   At the government-run Bir Hospital near the stadium, Maya Laxmi
Vaidya, a white-haired woman clad in a sari, said her 12-year-old
grandson was killed in the stampede.
   ``I've told my family not go out on Saturday. Older people
understand this and don't go out,'' she said.
   The day is considered unlucky among Nepal's Hindus. It is named
for the planet Saturn, which in Hindu mythology possesses strong
negative powers.
   The government ordered a judicial commission to investigate the
disaster and announced payments of $450 to relatives of the dead
and $90 to the injured.
   Crowds angered by authorities' failure to open the gates
attacked three cars with government license plates outside the
stadium with rocks, smashing windshields.
   Reporters who arrived at the stadium moments later found it
largely deserted. Sandals and shoes littered the ground near the
one open gate.
   Witnesses said most of the deaths occurred there, as spectators
who found other exits locked rushed toward the only outlet.
   Ram Bista, a teletype operator who took part in rescue efforts,
said spectators who got outside commandeered vehicles to rush
victims to hospitals.
   ``We stopped all buses, all taxis, all rickshaws,'' he said.
   One spectator who demanded anonymity accused police of being
``selfish. They took care of themselves and nobody came to help the
crowd,'' he said.
   It was Nepal's worst sports-related disaster on record.
   The downtown stadium was filled almost to capacity for the final
game of a major tournament in Nepal's most popular sport. The
Tribhuvan Challenge Shield Cup, named for a former Nepalese king,
pitted a team from the National Cigarette Factory against the Mukti
Joddha, meaning ``Freedom Fighters,'' from nearby Bangladesh.
   Stadium officials said none of the athletes was involved in the
stampede or was injured.
   Despite sunshine for most of the day, the storm howled through
this Himalayan capital at midafternoon, packing winds of more than
50 mph. It uprooted trees throughout Katmandu Valley and
temporarily disrupted telex lines.
   On Thursday evening, panicked soccer fans in Tripoli, Libya fled
knife-wielding ruffians and triggered the collapse of a sports
stadium, killing at least 20 people, news reports from Malta and
Yugoslavia said.
   The reports conflicted with those from the Libyan news agency
JANA, which said two people were killed and 16 were hospitalized.
   The worst soccer disaster on record took place on May 24, 1964,
when rioting left nearly 300 dead and 500 injured after Argentina
beat Peru on a last-minute goal in Lima.
   On May 29, 1985, 39 people died at Heysel Stadium in Brussels,
Belgium, when British soccer fans went on a rampage against Italian
fans.
   Fifty-three fans died on May 11, 1985, when a fire engulfed the
main stand during a match at Bradford City's soccer stadium in
northern England.
   On Jan. 2, 1971, 66 people died when an overcrowded stairway
collapsed during a local soccer match between Glasgow Rangers and
Celtic in Glasgow, Scotland.
   In 1969, El Salvador and Honduras suffered thousands of
casualties in the so-called ``Soccer War,'' which began after a
disputed soccer match between the two countries. The brief war was
provoked by Honduras' decision to expel many Salvadorans who had
settled in Honduras.

   Syria on Saturday rejected an American
proposal for an Arab-Israeli peace settlement, submitted last week
to Arab and Israeli leaders by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa also said he did not
believe any other Arab leader would support the plan.
   ``We have studied the American proposal and we think the plan,
as presented to us, is not acceptable. We also believe that it is
not acceptable to any other Arab side,'' Sharaa told reporters.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir also have rejected the plan. Shamir's rival in the
coalition government, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, supports the
plan.
   Sharaa spoke at Damascus Airport after seeing off his Swedish
counterpart, Sten Andersson. Andersson left for home after a
24-hour visit and talks with President Hafez Assad and Sharaa on
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Sharaa's statement was the first outright Syrian rejection of
the plan, which Shultz submitted to Assad during a visit to
Damascus March 4.
   Shultz handed copies of the proposal to King Hussein of Jordan,
Shamir, Peres and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   The proposal, aimed primarily at halting violence that has raged
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since Dec. 8, called for
limited self-rule for 1.5 million Palestinians living under Israeli
occupation.
   It also called for the formation of a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to negotiate a permanent
settlement in the West Bank and Gaza under an international peace
conference to convene by May 1.
   At a later parley, other Arab-Israeli conflicts, including the
future of the Syrian Golan Heights, occcupied by Israel in the 1967
war, would be discussed.
   Shultz had asked that the leaders concerned respond to his
proposal within 10 days.
   The Syrian president, speaking at a rally on Tuesday, had
indicated he rejected the plan, saying Israel did not want peace
and that the Arabs have no alternative but to keep up the fight
against the Jewish state.
   But he did not openly reject the plan.
   Earlier last week, Assad discussed the proposal with Hussein,
the Jordanian monarch, during a meeting in Damascus.
   Sharaa said ``we hope the American adminstration would come up
with a much clearer proposal,'' leaving the door open for
additional U.S.-Syrian consultations.
   Sharaa said Syria would not accept any settlement that is not
based on ``the termination of Israel's occupation and recognition
of Palestinian rights'' to self-determination and the establishment
of a state.

<HEAD>Conservative Judaism Says Jewish Identity Essentially Matter of
Religion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Judaism on Saturday offered its
first comprehensive definition of principles, declaring its faith
is linked to Israel, but not bound to it.
   Both Israel and the Diaspora, the countries to which the Jews
have been dispersed, are partners to ``aid and enrich the other in
every possible way,'' the 23,000-word statement said. ``Each needs
the other.''
   However, Jewish identity was termed essentially a matter of
religion rather than geography.
   ``Our religion has been land-centered but never land-bound,''
the document said. ``It has been a portable religion so that
despite our long exile from our spiritual homeland, we have been
able to survive creatively and spiritually.'' ``We do not believe
that Jewish identity can be replaced by Israeli identity, or the
ability to speak Hebrew. We are convinced that Jewish religion is
essential as a source of ethical and moral values,'' the authors
said.
   Some Jews have viewed the Jewish state as the ``religious center
of world Jewry,'' the statement said, adding that various Jewish
communities have ``complementary roles'' in maintaining Judaism.
   The statement, ``Emet Ve-Emunah,'' Hebrew for ``Truth and
Faith,'' was drawn up over 2{ years by a 35-member commission of
scholars, rabbis and laity set up in 1985.
   Never before in its history has the century-old Conservative
movement in this country produced such an overall summation of
convictions.
   Officials of the Rabbinical Assembly, the rabbinical arm of
Conservative Judaism, and its Jewish Theological Seminary hailed
the document as ``monumental and historic.''
   It provides a consensus view of the movement's ``positions on
personal and general questions'' affecting Jewish life, said the
commission chairman, seminary professor Robert Gordis.
   He termed it ``a way of life for the Jew today to live in
loyalty to the tradition without resigning from the 20th century.''
   Conservative Judaism is the middle ground between the other two
major branches, Reform, which freely adapts Jewish practices to
changing times, and Orthodoxy, which sees ritual as commanded by
God and thus unchangeable.
   Conservatism's statement deals with God, revelation, evil, the
Messianic hope, Jewish law, personal practices, the role of women,
Israel, social justice, relations with other faiths and meaning of
``chosen people.''
   The widely misunderstood ``chosen people'' concept often ``has
been distorted into an expression of moral arrogance,'' despite
counterefforts, the statement said.
   Instead of implying any innate Jewish superiority, God's
choosing of the Jews to reveal his purposes laid on them special
obligations and duties as a result of their accepting that role.
   ``Far from being a license for special privilege, it entailed
additional responsibilities not only toward God but to their fellow
human beings,'' the statement said.
   ``Often, however, they had to pay a bloody price for insisting
on this role, enabling them to identify with (the prophet) Isaiah's
`suffering servant' who accepted the blows and contempt of others
in order to bring the truth of God to the world.''
   The statement deplored the rifts that have developed among
different branches of Judaism and urged work to overcome them,
declaring:
   ``In the face of unflagging enemies and widespread
anti-Semitism, Jewish unity is more vital than ever. ... Only when
Jews live in harmony and peace with each other ... will we be
worthy of Messianic redemption.''
   Regarding Israel, the statement voiced deep attachment to the
land and pride in the achievement of the modern state in gathering
Jews from dispersion and ``rebuilding a nation.''
   However, the state's discrimination against the Conservative and
Reform movements is ``morally intolerable,'' the statement said.
   The writers said Israel should recognize religious authority of
all rabbis, not just the Orthodox, adding, ``We have often suffered
from discriminatory policies, but we remain firm and loving
supporters of the State of Israel.''
   Israel's Jews and their fellows living in the Diaspora ``have
sustained the creative survival of Am Yisrael (the Jewish
people),'' interacting ``in a continual symbiotic process of mutual
enrichment, the statement said.
   And Conservative Judaism offered this self-description:
   ``The Conservative movement affirms that the Jewish religion as
reflected in the Jewish way of life constitutes the most
significant factor that identifies, distinguishes, unites and
preserves the Jewish people.''

   Joe Redington couldn't run in the first
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973 because he was too busy
organizing the 1,100-mile marathon from Anchorage to Nome.
   He missed out again in 1983 when a run-in with an angry moose
during training left him with a few cracked ribs.
   But Redington, now 70, has run in every other Iditarod, a
torturous test of people and dogs billed as ``The Last Great
Race.'' And as this year's race approached the midpoint near the
frozen Yukon River, Redington was savoring the lead in a contest he
has never won.
   Redington, who has finished as high as fifth three times,
grabbed the lead Tuesday at Rohn, 271 miles from the start, and
held it until Saturday when he slipped into second place at the
Yukon River town of Galena, 452 miles from the finish.
   ``I feel like an old fox being chased by 50 young hounds,'' he
said.
   Redington earned the title ``Father of the Iditarod'' 16 years
ago when he spearheaded a movement to get Alaskans off snowmobiles
and back behind the dog teams that traditionally had provided
winter transportation across the vast state.
   To galvanize the mushing revival, he promoted an idea that many
thought impossible _ a race along the old Iditarod Trail, a supply
route used earlier this century to reach interior Alaska gold
mining districts.
   In 1925, dog teams relayed diphtheria serum along the trail to
the epidemic-stricken community of Nome on Norton Sound.
   Using that historic relay for inspiration, 36 wary mushers set
out from Anchorage in March 1973. For the next month, the dog teams
struggled up into the glacier-ribbed Alaska Range, dropped into the
timbered interior, mushed down the frozen Yukon, then crossed over
to the wind-blown Bering Sea coast for a final limp into Nome.
   It was a macho event full of the Alaska mystique, and the men
who finished _ no women raced until 1975 _ were instant heroes in
Alaska.
   Today, the race still bursts with a frontier aura. Rugged
mushers and their teams of 12 to 20 eager dogs brave blizzards,
wild animals, frostbite and 1,000 miles of sled-busting trail.
   But it's not quite so macho anymore.
   Since 1985, when Libby Riddles ventured into a howling gale and
left the men behind, women have dominated the race.
   Riddles won that race, and Susan Butcher has won the last two,
setting a course record each time. Last March, she finished in 11
days, 2 hours, about half the time it took in 1973.
   The fastest competitors have become mushing machines. Backed by
corporate sponsors and driving high-tech plastic sleds, they shave
hours from their race times by going without sleep for days. The
winner this year will get $30,000; the next 19 finishers will share
the rest of the $150,000 purse.
   But even some of the leaders refuse to take things too seriously.
   Duane ``Dewey'' Halverson, a perennial contender, remembers the
days when many mushers regarded the Iditarod as an extended camping
trip.
   ``I think the competition is a little stiffer than it used to
be,'' he said in McGrath while his dogs rested on straw laid down
in the snow.
   ``We'll make it and have fun and see where we finish, and I'll
get one of those little teeny trophies this year.''
   Then he grinned and pronounced his own philosophy of racing dogs
across the Alaska wilds:
   ``I'm going to have fun if it kills me.''

   The government on Saturday
banned a church-led opposition group headed by Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and said it was a threat to public safety.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said the recently created
Committee for the Defense of Democracy was barred from ``performing
any activities or acts whatsoever.''
   Police, meanwhile, issued a separate order banning a Sunday
rally in Cape Town that was to mark National Detainees Day.
   Tutu, who heads the Committee for the Defense of Democracy and
who planned to attend the rally, said clergymen instead would hold
a church service at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town. Similar
church services are scheduled in four other cities.
   ``We are dealing with a vicious government that will not
tolerate any opposition to its evil and immoral policies,'' Tutu
told a news conference. ``They have banned a committee even before
it has started operating.''
   Tutu's group was set up following the government's Feb. 24
crackdown on black-led opposition groups. In that crackdown, the
government banned 18 anti-apartheid organizations from
participating in politics.
   The Committee for the Defense of Democracy is led by several
church leaders, including Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize, and Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches. The clergymen said the group would attempt to
take over some the activities previously carried out by the
restricted organizations.
   However, Vlok's latest order places the same restrictions on
Tutu's group as the other anti-apartheid groups.
   ``Certain clergy are becoming more and more involved in
preaching revolution instead of the true Christian message,'' Vlok
said in a statement.
   Vlok accused church leaders of promoting the aims of the
outlawed African National Congress, which wages a bombing and
sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the white-led government.
   He cited a March 1 broadcast by ANC's Radio Freedom which called
for the church in South Africa to take a more active role in
opposing the government.
   ``The ANC is currently waging a desperate attempt to extend the
revolutionary onslaught and is aiming this attack more and more at
the churches and the whites,'' Vlok said.
   ``The church (should) direct itself to the spiritual area and
the government can rely on its prayers to solve the difficult
political problems in the country,'' Vlok added.
   Tutu's group helped arrange Sunday rallies at five sites across
the country to mark National Detainees Day. However, police
Saturday banned the Cape Town ceremony, where Tutu and Boesak were
to appear.
   Police spokesman L.J. Haasbroek said he had no information on
the status of the four remaining rallies.
   Clergymen indicated earlier this week they may defy any attempt
by authorities to stop them.
   Saturday's clampdown is the latest in a series of tough
government actions aimed at political opponents in recent weeks. In
addition to banning political activity by 18 groups, the government
has imposed restrictions on individual activists and introduced
legislation to prohibit foreign funding of political activity.
   In a related development, the Black Sash, an anti-apartheid
group made up of white women, estimated Saturday that 1,500
activists remain in detention without charge.
   Black Sash, which has not been directly affected by the recent
crackdowns, said it would continue ``to defend those who are
voiceless and incarcerated.''
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying lengths of time during the 21-month-old state of emergency.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Survivors of Gov. Evan Mecham's
administration have come forward at his impeachment trial with
tales of the chaotic final days when ``mistrust bred mistrust'' and
Mecham believed his enemies were spying on him with laser beams.
   A reluctant defense witness, electronics technician Antonio
Corio, told how he was sent to the governor's offices in November
to check the security system and do a ``sweep'' to detect
electronic bugs and laser beam listening devices.
   ``They had feelings there were leaks,'' Corio said.
``Information was getting out of the ninth floor somehow.''
   He said he was reminded that Mecham was publicly embarrassed by
reports that he thought laser beam listening devices were being
used to spy on him. The governor's office was seeking proof.
   ``What did you detect?'' asked Mecham defense attorney Fred
Craft.
   ``Not a whole lot,'' Corio said to the lawyer's surprise.
   The technician, who had been called to bolster the claim of
bugging, refused to cooperate once he was on the stand. He said he
knew about laser beam listening devices, but they have to be used
at close range.
   ``Could you detect sounds in the governor's office if you were
on the Capitol grounds?'' asked Craft.
   ``I don't think so,'' said Corio.
   As to who might be using such a device, the governor had a prime
suspect _ Attorney General Robert Corbin. Corbin said the only
laser he ever had was a toy he got for Christmas.
   Mecham, 63, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial
in six decades, is charged with obstructing an investigation by
Corbin into an alleged death threat against former Mecham aide
Donna Carlson by another Mecham associate, Lee Watkins.
   In other impeachment charges, the first-term Republican governor
is accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing
$80,000 in a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The
Arizona Senate is considering the obstruction charge first.
   Mecham faces a criminal trial April 21 on the loan charge and a
recall election May 17.
   The antagonism between Mecham and Corbin surfaced as witnesses
from Mecham's inner circle tried to explain why Mecham, faced with
a probe by Corbin into the alleged death threat, would have told
the state's top lawman, Col. Ralph Milstead: ``The attorney general
is out to hang me. ... Don't tell the attorney general anything.''
   Former Mecham aide Sam Steiger described a feud between Corbin
and Mecham that began in the first days of Mecham's term when
Corbin advised the governor to eliminate the state's Martin Luther
King holiday for state employees. He said it had been illegally
declared by Gov. Bruce Babbitt, Mecham's predecessor.
   ``The governor abided by that decision and took an inordinate
public beating over it,'' Steiger recalled. ``I thought the beating
should have been shared.'' But he said Corbin never announced it
was his idea.
   Steiger acknowledged under cross-examination that, ``I would be
less than candid if I were to say the governor was a supporter of
the (Martin Luther King) holiday.''
   Mecham's other perceived enemy was the news media, and Steiger
suggested this led to his downfall.
   ``He was a man who won election essentially without the press
and the (Republican) party,'' he said. ``He learned he could be
elected without them. What he forgot was he couldn't survive
without them.''
   In the final months before Mecham was impeached by the House of
Representatives on Feb. 5, close aides such as Ms. Carlson resigned
in protest of Mecham's policies. Peggy Griffith, Mecham's chief of
women's services, said she and Ms. Carlson, friends for many years,
stopped speaking.
   ``Mistrust bred mistrust,'' said Steiger.
   ``You would agree that the Mecham inner circle was paranoid?''
prosecutor Paul Eckstein asked Steiger.
   ``No, I would not agree with that,'' said Steiger who suggested
that concern about electronic bugs and traitors on the staff were
realistic.
   The final staff split with Mecham was over Watkins, in charge of
prison construction, said several witnesses. Staffers almost
unanimously favored dismissal of the unpopular Watkins even before
he was accused of making a death threat on Ms. Carlson, then a
grand jury witness against Mecham.
   ``With people telling him Mr. Watkins should go, he is the kind
of person that would dig in his heels and, absent a compelling
reason, would defend Mr. Watkins,'' Steiger said of Mecham.
   Ms. Carlson also said she was told by Mecham's chief of staff,
Jim Colter: `We have to take care of Lee. He raised a lot of money
for the campaign.''

<HEAD>McFarlane Plea A Major Breakthrough for Iran-Contra Prosecutor</HEAD>

   By allowing Robert C. McFarlane to plead
guilty to four misdemeanor counts, Independent Counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh virtually secured a major prosecution witness if other
players in the Iran-Contra affair go to trial.
   McFarlane's promise of full cooperation as part of the plea
agreement is a prize for Walsh. The former national security
adviser was among the inner circle of Reagan administration aides
who masterminded the Iran-Contra scheme.
   Walsh said McFarlane's cooperation would solve the technical
problem of ``joinder.'' Legal experts said this means Walsh could
have live testimony from a crucial player instead of having to
build his case around documents.
   McFarlane, who was national security adviser from October 1983
through November 1985, initiated the review of U.S. arms policy
toward Iran. After leaving the White House he remained a key
policymaker, leading an unsuccessful arms-for-hostages mission to
Tehran in May 1986.
   His guilty plea focused on his role in secret U.S. assistance to
the Nicaraguan Contras at a time Congress had banned such aid.
   He admitted that he withheld information about the activities of
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and other members of the National Security
Council staff in three 1985 letters to House committees.
   He also admitted withholding information from the House Foreign
Affairs Committee when he told the panel on Dec. 8, 1986, that he
was unaware of any efforts to solicit donations for the Contras
from a third country.
   Although Walsh and McFarlane agreed that the cooperation was
voluntary, the independent counsel acknowledged McFarlane could
have faced much more serious perjury charges if he was
uncooperative.
   Each of the misdemeanor counts of withholding information
carries a maximum one year prison term. By contrast, felony perjury
charges carry a maximum of five years in prison, and larger fines
also could be levied.
   Walsh said McFarlane's cooperation wasn't the only reason he
went the misdemeanor route.
   He cited McFarlane's ``undisguised demonstration of remorse
after the false testimony was given in which he tried to correct
his testimony; and actually imposed injury upon himself in a fit of
depression,'' a reference to McFarlane's attempted suicide via an
overdose of Valium last year.
   While admitting his guilt, McFarlane told reporters he acted at
a time that relations between Congress and the White House ``broke
down so tragically.''
   ``My actions were motivated by what I believed to be in the
foreign policy interest of the United States,'' he said.
   McFarlane's comments were reminiscent of remarks by former CIA
Director Richard Helms on Oct. 31, 1977, when he pleaded no contest
to two misdemeanor charges under the same law used by Walsh.
   The charges against Helms arose from his testimony to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee that the CIA had made no attempt to
prevent the election of Marxist Salvador Allende as president of
Chile in 1970.
   ``I found myself in a position of conflict,'' said Helms. ``I
had sworn by my oath to preserve certain secrets ... I didn't want
to lie. I didn't want to mislead the Senate. I was simply trying to
find my way through a very difficult situation in which I found
myself.''

<HEAD>Magazine Publishes Late Writer's Memoir on Stalinism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A monthly magazine has published the first half of
an unfinished memoir by late poet Konstantin M. Simonov in which he
explores the shame felt by Soviets like himself who aided the
repressions of dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   Simonov began the memoir in 1979 but died in 1980 before he
could finish it.
   He wrote the book ``for the archives'' and told his secretary
that he did not expect to see the memoir published in his lifetime,
explained an accompanying publisher's note in the March issue of
Znamya, a literary journal.
   Articles and books re-examining the legacy of Stalin have been
appearing regularly over the past year as Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's campaign for glasnost, or openness, encourages broader
discussion of social and historical problems.
   The memoir, ``Through the Eyes of a Person of My Generation,''
attempts to explain, without excusing, the behavior of those who
grew to regard Stalin's excesses as a normal state of affairs.
   Referring to his acceptance of the arrest and exile of three
aunts in the 1930s, Simonov wrote four decades later that such
events ``which seem monstrous and impossible today, were then a
norm and gradually became habitual.''
   He wrote that the rationale he adopted at the time was ``you
can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.''
   Simonov, who was twice honored with the Stalin Prize for
literature and earned numerous other accolades during his writing
career, was one of the many literary figures who followed the
government's lead in denouncing poet Anna Akhmatova, writer Mikhail
Zoshchenko and others in a 1946 purge of the intelligentsia.
   He referred to the role he played in ruining the careers of
contemporaries only as ``the events of 1946,'' acknowledging that
his readers would know what he meant.
   Simonov had confessed to sinning against his conscience in
denouncing respected writers and artists. In the way of atonement,
he championed the suppressed works of writer Mikhail Bulgakov and
eventually succeeded in getting published his masterpiece, ``The
Master and Margarita.''
   The weekly newspaper Moscow News published a commentary on the
Simonov memoir, observing that Simonov was trying to explain why it
is possible for many Russians to feel both awe for Stalin's
accomplishments and revulsion over his purges.
   The second half of the unfinished memoir is to be published in
April edition of Znamya, the journal said.

<HEAD>Early Talks Only Way To Mend Damaged Relationship with Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s failed attempt to quietly sell
off a fifth of the company before its United Auto Workers contract
expired has created a fracture in labor relations that the two
sides hope can be healed at the bargaining table.
   The No. 3 automaker once planned to use the months before its
three-year UAW contract expires Sept. 14 to rid itself of most
parts operations by selling its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc.
subsidiary.
   Under that plan, Chrysler could have evaded restrictions on
closing plants or shifting inside work to outside suppliers that
already are in place at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
under the established UAW pattern contracts for the auto industry.
   Instead, Chrysler found itself with a work force whose anger
exploded over the possible sale and remains largely unappeased by
Chrysler's retreat in the face of a threat of crippling
plant-by-plant strikes.
   ``There's still a lot of hard feelings and the central issue is
still not settled,'' said UAW Local 412 President Jim Jensen, whose
local represents engineers and other salaried Chrysler workers in
the Detroit area.
   Rather than allow the anger to simmer and build during the three
or four crucial months before contract talks open, hurting chances
of a settlement and continued quality production, Chrysler asked
for early negotiations.
   ``It's always important to resolve issues that are
outstanding,'' said Chrysler's chief negotiator, human resources
Vice President Anthony St. John. ``We've had some convergence of
issues that have been very difficult for the union and for
Chrysler.''
   The UAW agreed last week, marking the third time in the last 10
years that the two will bargain early. Once before, in 1982, the
early talks failed. But this time, neither side can easily afford a
failure at the table.
   Chrysler and the union are betting that in the talks, which
could begin as early as next month and will cover 59,500 workers,
they'll be able to fix the problem rather than make it worse.
   But difficult issues remain, beginning with Acustar. In
announcing its retreat from the sale, Chrysler said it would
instead close four Acustar plants, affecting 2,000 workers, if it
can't sell them in 18 months.
   ``We as a union are not prepared to just give up and say there
goes 2,000 jobs,'' said Jensen, who will be one of 10 elected
members of the union's bargaining team.
   St. John, however, said last week that the fate of the plants is
not up for negotiation.
   Jensen and other workers also say they expect Chrysler to seek a
two-tier wage system _ paying parts workers lower wages and
benefits than assembly workers _ because it has shown it considers
the parts operation too expensive.
   The UAW sidelined similar attempts by Ford and General Motors
last fall when it negotiated new three-year contracts with
Chrysler's larger rivals.
   ``Given the enormous reaction to Acustar, Chrysler's ability to
institute two-tier wages in this round of negotiations would be
very low,'' said Harley Shaiken, labor and technology expert at the
University of California at San Diego.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said the union will demand a two-year
contract so that in 1990, the GM, Ford and Chrysler contracts will
expire together for the first time since 1979.
   Bargaining with the Big Three together makes it easier for the
union to impose one contract on all and gives it a third choice
when it is choosing a strike target, the company whose contract
serves as the pattern for the others.
   St. John said Chrysler finds advantages in remaining out of
synch with GM and Ford. Chrysler sought a separate relationship
with the union beginning in 1979, when workers made the first of
many concessions to help the automaker survive.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in 21 years, former
Black Panther Johnny Spain is out of jail, but the man convicted of
slaying two prison guards in the bloody 1971 ``San Quentin Six''
escape attempt is not yet a free man.
   Release of the one-time prison revolutionary has been opposed
consistently by the state. But his parole has been urged by
enthusiastic supporters, including Dennis Riordan, his attorney for
the past 12 years, two congressmen and two prison guards, one the
best friend of one of the slain San Quentin officers.
   While in prison, Spain, 38, earned a high school diploma, became
an electrician and has been a model prisoner in recent years. He
has had no disciplinary action against him since 1979, when he was
caught with marijuana.
   He left the California Medical Facility in Vacaville last week
after a series of court actions allowed friends and relatives to
post $350,000 bail for his freedom.
   ``I won't let anyone down who has supported me, and there have
been many who supported me,'' he promised upon his release, adding
that he expected life outside prison to be difficult. ``I'll deal
with it. I'm prepared. I've thought about it a lot.''
   However, Spain still faces a new trial on the prison murders and
a Monday hearing at which the state will argue against the order
calling for that trial. A 2-1 state Board of Prison Terms decision
to parole Spain next year also will be reviewed by the entire
nine-member board March 11.
   Spain had been behind bars continuously since his arrest at the
age of 17 in December 1966 for the first-degree murder and robbery
of a Los Angeles man.
   While on bail, authorities said Spain will live in San Francisco
and work as an electrician. He also will be allowed to travel
around the state and visit his wife and childhood sweetheart,
Pinkey, whom he married in 1977 while in prison. They have two sons.
   It was a twisting courtroom trail that finally opened Spain's
cell door.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson overturned the San Quentin
murder conviction in 1986, saying Spain had been deprived of his
right to a fair trial by being shackled in 25 pounds of chains in
every court appearance in the case.
   But Spain still had to remain behind bars because of the 1966
murder conviction.
   But Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Parker
ordered Spain paroled immediately for the 1966 murder-robbery.
Parker said he was eligible for release because the state Board of
Prison Terms improperly extended his sentence six years by applying
regulations passed in 1976 to disciplinary violations committed in
1970 and 1971.
   That action cleared the way for bail to be set in the San
Quentin retrial.
   During a trial that took almost five years, Spain was convicted
of murdering two San Quentin guards in a bloodbath that left one
other guard, prison militant George Jackson and two prisoners dead.
   Prison authorities said Spain was seen bolting from the
maximum-security unit with Jackson and helped plot the unsuccessful
escape attempt.
   Although no one said Spain actually killed guards Jere Graham
and Frank DeLeon, he was found culpable under state law because he
had conspired to escape with Jackson.
   Bullets hidden in hollow bars of soap and a map reportedly
showing escape routes were found afterward in his cell in a section
reserved for death row and problem inmates.
   Spain and Jackson, a Black Panther leader and author of the
book, ``Soledad Brothers,'' had become friends while incarcerated
together at Soledad State Prison before both were transfered to San
Quentin.
   Spain had a troubled childhood in Jackson, Miss. His mother was
a white woman married to a white man, but as Spain grew up, it
became increasingly clear that his biological father was a black
man, not his mother's husband. Segregated black schools refused to
accept him, as did white schools.
   His mother sent him at the age of 6 to live with a black couple
in East Los Angeles. He became a high school athlete, but also
joined a street gang and committed minor crimes that netted him a
stint in a juvenile facility before the 1966 robbery-murder.

<HEAD>Vatican Offical Says Relations Improving With Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vatican official said Saturday that permission
from Cuba's communist government to send 20 foreign priests to Cuba
was a sign of improving relations between the Roman Catholic church
and that Caribbean nation.
   However, Monsignor Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, director of the
Vaticans' Secretariat of the Episcopal Conference, told Vatican
Radio that the church hopes for still more improvement in the area
of individual rights.
   He said the church would like to see more religious freedom in
Cuba and the construction of new churches.
   He said there has not been ``sensational changes in the rapport
between the church and state, between Catholics and Marxists. But,
nevertheless, things are moving and I would like to say they are
moving in the right way.''
   De Cespedes said examples of change were the government allowing
the Cuban church to import 30,000 Bibles last year and permission
last week for the church to send 20 foreign priests to Cuba.
   Vatican Radio said there are 406 Cuban priests to serve the
predominantly Catholic population of about 10 million.
   It said most of the 20 foreign priests that will go to Cuba are
Spanish or Italian, but there also will be one Mexican and one
Canadian.
   Rebels led by Fidel Castro ousted the Fulgencio Batista
dictatorsyip in 1959 and in December 1961 Castro declared Cuba
would be a Marxist-Leninist state.

   As the presidential campaign moved from the
South to Illinois, Associated Press bureaus in the Super Tuesday
states surveyed officials' reactions to their innovative regional
primary. Here is a report.
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   If the goal was to beat Iowa, the Wednesday morning quarterbacks
agreed, the South had a winner in its ``Super Tuesday'' regional
presidential primary election experiment.
   Many officials in the 20 voting states were elated to have real,
live presidential candidates trooping through, but some felt they
could have attracted more attention with a less crowded primary.
   ``Super Tuesday did what I thought it would do,'' said Georgia
Secretary of State Max Cleland. ``It has meant sudden death to most
candidates and sudden life to a few.''
   Jim Hunt, former governor of North Carolina, thought Super
Tuesday proved its worth. His candidate, Sen. Albert Gore of
Tennessee, gained the stature he needed after ignoring earlier
contests in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
   But although Gore did well, he had to share the victory with two
liberals, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
Each won about a third of the states and delegates.
   Alabama Republican Party Chairman Emory Folmar called that a
defeat for Southern leaders who had hoped Super Tuesday would give
the edge to a moderate or conservative.
   ``It blew up in their faces,'' Folmar said.
   But the Democratic finish, combined with Vice President George
Bush's 16-1 sweep of Tuesday's primaries and caucuses, turned the
Iowa caucus results on their head. There Rep. Richard Gephardt was
the Democratic winner, while Sen. Robert Dole and Pat Robertson
both beat Bush.
   ``Presidential candidates may approach the race differently as
the result of Super Tuesday. It could be they will no longer
consider Iowa a must stop,'' said U.S. Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa.
   ``Gore's strategy has revealed that the New Hampshire primary
doesn't control how the Democratic nominee will be selected,'' said
Oklahoma Attorney General Robert Henry.
   However, Joe Grandmaison, New Hampshire's Democratic party
chief, said Super Tuesday proved the ``value and singularity'' of
his state's first-in-the-nation primary. ``New Hampshire's brand of
retail politics forces the candidates to face the voters and debate
the issues,'' he said.
   Many Democrats in the South and some Republicans were pleased
with the outcome.
   ``We wanted to nationalize our message, and we accomplished
that. Compare the rhetoric between 1984 and 1988. It was far less
damaging this year than four years ago,'' said former Gov. Charles
Robb of Virginia, a Democrat who endorsed Gore and promoted the
Super Tuesday idea.
   ``Before this year, all the presidential candidates did in the
South was change planes in the Atlanta airport,'' said former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, a Republican.
   ``We just felt for years like the candidates were ignoring us to
go to Iowa and New Hampshire. We've had more presidential
candidates in Texas already this time than we've had in the whole
past 10 years,'' said former Texas state Sen. John Traeger.
   U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Super Tuesday forced
candidates to address locally important issues such as low oil
prices, but he thought the calendar was too crowded with 14
southern and border states, plus six other states and American
Samoa, holding primaries or caucuses.
   ``I'd rather Texas be out by itself. I wish we could figure out
some way to get it ahead of Iowa,'' Bentsen said.
   Wallace Hyde, a Democratic fund-raiser from Asheville, N.C., and
co-chairman of Gore's state campaign, was happier.
   ``It worked _ almost on the money,'' he said. ``You definitely
came out of it with a moderately conservative candidate.''
   However, Texas state Sen. Chet Edwards said Super Tuesday was
not conceived as a way ``to elect some Neanderthal Anglo
Southerner.''
   ``It was designed to give 16 million Texans and citizens
throughout the South a voice in the selection of our president and
a voice in the setting of our national agenda,'' he said.
   John Weaver, executive director of the Texas GOP, thought
Democrats hoping for a conservative must be disappointed.
   ``I'm sure the people who hoped the Democrats would nominate
(Sen.) Sam Nunn or Chuck Robb would rather put this primary in a
burlap bag and drop it in the Colorado River,'' Weaver said.
   Judge-Executive Jerry Taylor of Whitley County, Ky., called
Super Tuesday ``the biggest farce there ever was.''
   ``Unless you have something locally as a drawing card, it's just
difficult to get people involved,'' said Taylor, a Democrat.
   Turnout in Kentucky was 24.4 percent for Democrats and 22.1
percent for Republicans.
   Most states did better. Georgia had a 40 percent turnout
overall, a record for a presidential primary in that state, and a
GOP turnout which doubled the previous mark.
   Mississippi's Republicans had a record turnout, 31 percent of
the total vote in a traditionally Democratic state. ``In fact, it
was double what we've had before in a Republican primary,'' said
Evelyn McPhail, executive director of the Mississippi GOP.
   In Texas, a presidential primary record 2.77 million voters
participated, or 35 percent.
   In Tennessee and North Carolina, officials said the turnout was
about the same as in previous, non-super primaries.
   In Maryland, the Democratic turnout of 38 percent compared to 34
percent four years ago, when Walter Mondale was all but unopposed,
and 48 percent in 1976 when Jimmy Carter ran against former
Calfiornia Gov. Jerry Brown.
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat, called the
March 8 primary a waste of time that drew only token appearances by
the candidates.
   ``Mr. Bush made a telephone call to one of the Baltimore radio
stations,'' Schaefer said. ``I would hope we would go back to May
when the candidate would have to come through and talk to the
people.''
   Maryland also held its Congressional primaries March 8, and GOP
chairman Dan Fleming said the early primary made it impossible to
find a candidate to oppose Rep. Tom McMillen, even though the
first-term Democrat won by only 428 votes in 1986 in a historically
Republican district.
   ``People aren't used to thinking about the election until the
first of the year. Here we had a filing deadline that was in
December for a March primary,'' said Schaefer.
   In Massachusetts, Republican and Democratic leaders agreed they
would not want to compete with a southern primary again.
   Joe Malone, executive director of the Republican State Committee
in Massachusetts, also complained that a big, one-day contest gives
an advantage to candidates with money and organization.
   ``Once you get into what is the closest thing to a national
primary, then you better have a lot of ammunition,'' Malone said.

   With excitement in his hands rather than
voice, Alfred Sonnenstrahl expressed in candid, joyful words the
sense of triumph shared by fellow protesters who made themselves
heard on the quietest college campus in America.
   ``I've been on this campus for 30 years now,'' he said in sign
language. ``And for the first time in my whole life I feel good
about being here. For the first time I feel like a complete
person.''
   The 52-year-old mechanical engineer, a doctoral candidate at
Gallaudet University, pointed to the students, staff and faculty
who had shut down the school for the deaf last week to protest the
appointment of a hearing president.
   ``Look around,'' Sonnenstrahl signed. ``You see people smiling.
They look alive.''
   The transformation of Gallaudet occurred even before Elisabeth
Ann Zinser, who is not deaf and does not know sign language, gave
in to mounting pressure for a deaf president and stepped down only
days after she was chosen.
   There was no mistaking the exhilaration in the brisk air. More
than a generation after the civil rights movement began, the time
for the deaf was _ finally _ now.
   Even Zinser acknowledged the strength of the movement in a news
conference the day she resigned.
   The protest, she said, was ``a very special moment in time for
the deaf community ... (that) we could not anticipate.''
   Twenty years ago, blacks devastated by Martin Luther King Jr.'s
murder looted and burned a major commercial strip that is only now
being rebuilt. Four blocks away, behind its tall fence, Gallaudet
lay isolated and hidden under a thick blanket of silence.
   Only in the last few years, with civil rights laws,
communications technology and a wave of professional interpreters,
has that silence begun to lift. Deaf people say they are more aware
of their rights, more self-confident and more assertive. Thus the
stage was set for last week's eruption.
   The campus crusade drew headlines and ``Nightline,'' the
attention of congressmen and presidential candidates, the support
of commuters and taxi drivers and contributors across the country,
the largess of local corporations who donated food, paint and 50
sheets with which to make banners.
   The protesters liken themselves to prisoners or slaves and the
blacks of South Africa. Nothing, they say, will ever be the same.
   ``We have been accepting bowing down for 124 years, maybe
longer,'' said student leader Jerry Covell. ``We want to take
control of our lives and our futures.''
   President Lincoln chartered the school 124 years ago. It later
was named after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a pioneer in deaf
education. The nation's only liberal arts school for the deaf, it
is described again and again as an intellectual mecca; its
presidency, the loftiest post to which a deaf person could aspire.
   So, it's not hard to understand the resentment created by the
appointment of a hearing, non-signing president _ particularly when
there were two deaf finalists for the job, including the
university's own dean of arts and sciences.
   ``Deaf people own businesses. We have deaf lawyers and deaf
dentists. We have deaf stockbrokers and deaf millionaires. The only
thing we've never had is a deaf president of this college,'' said
Angel Ramos, 38, a math professor and doctoral candidate at
Gallaudet. ``We'll never be telephone operators. But there's no
reason we cannot have a deaf president here.''
   The Gallaudet presidency was last open in 1983, and the board of
trustees chose Jerry Lee _ another hearing person, but one who knew
sign language and who had been part of the campus community for
several years.
   There was no uprising then, nor in 1969 when Edward Merrill
began his 14-year tenure as president. Students did complain that
he didn't know sign language and they asked him to learn. Now they
want far more.
   ``We were never given opportunities to manage schools before
1980,'' said John Kubis, 62, a math professor at Gallaudet since
1957. ``In 1983, there were a few qualified deaf candidates but
they only had a few years of administrative experience. Now we have
deaf people who are as much if not more experienced as Dr. Zinser.''
   Deaf people have been slowly emerging from their isolation since
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which barred discrimination against
the handicapped in federally funded programs or activities.
   The process has been speeded by a proliferation of professional,
impartial interpreters. ``During the early days, interpreters were
very few and far between,'' Kubis said. ``They talked down to the
deaf. Instead of being our tools to communicate, they would tell us
what they thought we should say and censor the dialogue.''
   The deaf community was ripe for rebellion for other reasons as
well _ the advent of closed captioning on television, telephone
access through telecommunications devices for the deaf and
computers through which deaf people can communicate with anyone.
   Protesters claimed only a partial victory when Zinser withdrew
Friday. They say a deaf president has yet to be named. They also
want a majority of deaf people on the 20-member board of trustees
that runs the university. Now, only four members are deaf.
   But the demonstrators said events at Gallaudet had already
brought irrevocable changes.
   ``There's no way things will ever be the same again,'' said
Ramos, a protest leader. ``Deaf people throughout the world have
finally learned what other minority groups have learned _ that if
you stick together and walk together, you will succeed. Finally,
after 124 years, the deaf community has taken charge of their own
destiny, and we're mighty proud of it.''

<HEAD>Satellites Prepare Move To Permanent Orbit After Flawless Launch</HEAD>

   American and French
telecommunications satellites sent into space by Europe's Ariane 3
rocket were prepared Saturday to move into permanent orbits on
their own power.
   The European Space Agency also announced plans for two more
launches in May.
   Technicians said France's Telecom 1C and the American Spacenet
IIIR-Geostar, which includes facilities for The Associated Press,
were thrust into a geographically stationary orbit Friday night
about 20 minutes after liftoff from this South American jungle base.
   Officials called the launch perfect.
   Arianespace, the space agency's commercial arm, said Saturday
two more launches were planned for May, one a demonstration flight
of the more powerful Ariane 4 rocket. Arianespace is now the West's
only active commercial satellite launcher with America's
space-shuttle program grounded.
   The Ariane 3 rocket ignited normally four minutes after
blastoff, officials said. Ignition was the cause of failed Ariane
launches in September 1982, September 1985 and May 1986.
   The last failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded for
more than a year.
   Technicians said Friday's satellites obtained an altitute of
22,554 miles.
   The French satellite is to begin moving into its definitive
geostationary orbit Sunday, 37 hours after the launch, after
igniting its own engine, Arianespace said.
   Spacenet IIIR-Geostar is to start moving into a permanent orbit
about 90 hours after the liftoff, the company said.
   GTE Spacenet, the European firm's first American client, has
used the Ariane to launch five satellites, losing one in a
September 1985 failure.
   Jerry Waylan, GTE Spacenet chief, said this was the first
American telecommunications satellite to be launched in two years.
   The satellite, with an expected lifetime of 10 years, weighed
2,674 pounds before liftoff and 1,562 pounds in orbit.
   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by AP are to provide
the New York-based news cooperative with domestic satellite
delivery services.
   The French Telecom IC, replacing one that broke down Jan. 15, is
to be used for telephones, radio and television transmissions and
military communications.
   Arianespace said it has orders for 41 more satellite launchings,
valued at $2.29 billion.

   Two months into the trial of Lyndon LaRouche comes
evidence supporting the political extremist's claim that he was the
target of plots by the FBI, the CIA and even Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   Now, even some defense lawyers who had dismissed LaRouche's
allegations of a conspiracy theory as one of his many bizarre
claims are taking notice. LaRouche has also said Britain's Queen
Elizabeth condones drug trafficking and that one way to help the
U.S. economy is to populate Mars.
   The trial of LaRouche, six aides, and five of his political
organizations on fraud and conspiracy charges was halted Friday so
that defense attorneys could search government files, including
those of the White House and Vice President George Bush, for any
evidence suggesting infiltration of LaRouche groups.
   Prosecutors have insisted that talk of FBI, CIA and other
government infiltration in recently declassified documents is just
that _ talk _ and that the subject is irrelevant to charges that
LaRouche and followers conspired to stymie a grand jury
investigation into alleged fraud by fund-raisers during his 1984
presidential campaign.
   But, at least for now, LaRouche has turned the tables on the
government, which has been ordered to search thousands of files
belonging to the FBI, CIA, the National Security Council and Bush.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham on Monday is to update U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Keeton on the status of the search. The
judge will decide whether to resume testimony Tuesday or wait until
the search is completed.
   LaRouche lawyers last week received a copy of a memo from
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to North, two principals
in the Iran-Contra affair, in which Secord says retired Army Sgt.
Major Fred Lewis had met with the FBI and ``other agency reps'' and
has ``collected info against LaRouche.''
   The defense then demanded FBI files mentioning Lewis. After
first refusing to do so, the FBI declassified parts of a document
in which Lewis and two Texas lawmen who had worked as government
informants say the FBI and CIA asked them to infiltrate LaRouche
groups.
   Lewis and the lawmen were involved in two Texas companies
reportedly used by the Pentagon and CIA for covert activities.
Markham insists they are lying about infiltrating LaRouche groups.
   But the mere existence of the FBI document and the Secord-North
memo, discovered months after Markham had said searches of
government records were complete, was enough to persuade the judge
to halt testimony and order new searches.
   It also was enough to convert Michael Reilly, attorney for
LaRouche's central political organization, the National Caucus of
Labor Committees. Reilly had told the jury in his opening statement
that LaRouche's infiltration claim was misguided paranoia.
   ``This is a fundamental change in my defense strategy,'' Reilly
said. ``I should have had this 18 months ago and I have a right to
have it before I pursue this case.''
   Another defense attorney, William Moffitt, says his legal
strategy may be affected by the document searches.
   In his opening statement, Markham referred to an entry in a
notebook seized from Moffitt's client, LaRouche aide Jeffrey
Steinberg, as evidence LaRouche and aides conspired to obstruct the
grand jury investigation.
   The Aug. 23, 1986, entry is attributed to Ryan Quade Emerson,
who at the time had recently returned to the LaRouche organization.
Five days earlier, according to documents recently surrendered to
defense lawyers, an FBI agent interviewed Emerson and asked him to
rejoin the LaRouche organization.
   The prosecutor's task will be to convince Keeton that references
to FBI and CIA infiltration of LaRouche groups are unsubstantiated
and irrelevant to the case.
   The defense lawyers, who concede the material may not be
directly relevant, say it nevertheless supports their argument that
LaRouche and his followers are longtime government targets and
victims of entrapment.
   Ironically, LaRouche missed the week of his trial he would have
enjoyed the most. With court permission, he went to West Germany
for cataract surgery last week and is not expected back for several
weeks.

   Several lawmakers have criticized a group of
congressional aides for meeting secretly with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in January, only weeks after Congress voted to close
Palestine Liberation Organization offices in the United States.
   The secret, two-hour meeting, which took place in Baghdad, Iraq,
became publicly known last week. It was arranged by the National
Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, the group that paid for the
congressional aides' eight-day trip to Iraq on Jan. 11-19.
   The meeting, described as an open exchange between Arafat and
the aides, was held shortly after Congress passed controversial
legislation shutting down two PLO offices in the United States on
the grounds they represent a terrorist organization. Arafat is head
of the PLO.
   ``It was very foolish, very wrong,'' Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla.,
said of the aides' meeting. ``He (Arafat) is not going to change
his positions because a Capitol Hill staffer meets with him.''
   Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., said he was upset when he
learned an aide attended the Baghdad meeting with Arafat.
   ``She acted independently, and I had no knowledge of this
meeting nor would I have approved it, and I remain very disturbed
about it.'' The staffer no longer works for Torricelli, but left
for personal reasons unrelated to the meeting.
   But another lawmaker was unfazed by his aide's attendance at the
meeting.
   Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, said his assistant ``was not on any
official trip and he was traveling in a personal capacity.''
   Michael Van Dusen, staff director of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, said seeing Arafat was
``extremely unwise when as a matter of law American officials are
not supposed to negotiate with the PLO. ... I wouldn't do it.''
   U.S. policy _ set by Congress _ prohibits officials in the
executive branch from negotiating with Arafat or members of the PLO
until the group recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   The policy does not apply to Congress, and a few lawmakers as
well as members of their staff have met openly with Arafat in the
past.
   While the congressional group did not violate the law, members
of Congress and key staff people on Capitol Hill said that, in view
of U.S. policy, it was unwise to hold discussions with Arafat,
particularly if a lawmaker had not authorized the talks.
   Ronald W. Cathell, the executive director of U.S.-Arab council,
said he would not release the names of the staffers who attended
the Arafat meeting or traveled to Iraq for fear they would be
subjected to reprisals for going to the meeting.
   The council, which seeks to promote understanding between
Americans and Arabs, receives its money from grants and private and
corporate contributions.
   Several staffers contacted about the meeting refused to talk
about it and would not provide the names of their companions.
   People with knowledge of the free trip confirmed that those who
went to Iraq worked for Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; John Heinz,
R-Pa.; J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., David Karnes, R-Neb; and Reps.
Feighan; Torricelli; Helen Bentley, R-Md.; Douglas Bereuter,
R-Neb.; William Clay, D-Mo.; James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Robert
Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   Bereuter's spokeswoman, Carol Lawrence, said the congressman's
aide resigned before the trip, but now works at the Pentagon.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition on anonymity,
said all but one of the staffers on the Iraq trip went to the
meeting with Arafat.
   Cathell said the original agenda did not include seeing Arafat.
Once the group arrived in Baghdad, the council learned the PLO
leader was in town and broached the possibility of a meeting with
the congressional aides.
   The staffers were never pressured to attend the meeting, which
Cathell said was designed to give them ``information they could
relate to their bosses.'' The staffers were told, ``It's totally up
to you,'' he said.
   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the group was
given less than an hour's notice that a face-to-face meeting with
Arafat had been fixed.
   Torricelli complained the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad failed to
advise his aide about U.S. policy prohibiting official negotiations
with the PLO. Cathell said the embassy simply told the group its
own people couldn't attend the meeting because of U.S. policy.
   But a State Department official, refusing to be identified by
name, said the U.S. ambassador had tried to dissuade the Americans
from meeting with Arafat.
   Cathell said the meeting was constructive, and gave the staffers
``a unique chance to find out firsthand where the Palestinian
stood.'' The aides, he said, were ``candid and forthright'' with
Arafat.
   The Baghdad meeting came a few months after Congress voted to
close both the PLO's office at the United Nations in New York, and
a Palestine Information Office in Washington.
   Lawmakers took the action, which has provoked widespread
criticism from civil libertarians and U.N. members, on the grounds
that the PLO supports terrorism.
   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., has introduced legislation
to repeal the closings.

   Federal investigators have concluded their
four-day hearing into the cause of a Continental jet crash that
killed 28 people, but their findings probably won't be released
until sometime around the accident's first anniversary in November.
   ``We have not eliminated any issue'' in the suspected cause of
the Nov. 15 crash of Flight 1713, board of inquiry chairman Joseph
T. Nall said Friday after investigators heard the final testimony
in the National Transportation Safety Board hearings.
   Flight 1713, bound for Boise, Idaho, began rocking violently
moments after taking off from Stapleton International Airport
during a snowstorm. It flipped over on its back and crashed on the
runway, breaking into three pieces.
   Fifty-four of the 82 people on board survived. Some of those
survivors were among the 33 witnesses who testified at the hearing.
   The NTSB investigators were looking into flight characteristics
of the DC-9-10 aircraft, especially in snow and ice conditions; air
traffic control; cold weather operations by Continental;
turbulence; and Continental's pilot training, pilot selection and
crew pairing.
   ``I anticipate our board will determine a probable cause and
contributing causes to the crash'' by November, Nall said.
   The pilot and co-pilot, Capt. Frank Zvonek, 43, and First
Officer Lee Bruecher, 26, both were killed in the crash. Bruecher
was at the controls.
   The brief flying time in the DC-9 by both pilots has been one
area of study by the investigation.
   Zvonek had 12,135 total hours flying time, with 33 hours as a
DC-9 captain. Bruecher had a total of 3,186 hours, with 12 hours as
a DC-9 first officer.
   At Friday's hearings, Richard Hillman, Continental vice
president for flight operations, said that since the crash, the
carrier had adopted a Federal Aviation Administration bulletin
recommendation that the co-pilot not be allowed to make takeoffs or
landings until he or she had 100 hours in that type of aircraft.
   The hearings also delved into Continental's use of a flight
simulator in pilot training that is based on the DC-9-30 _ a
different model of DC-9 from the ``Dash 10'' flown by Zvonek and
Bruecher.
   The main difference between the two DC-9 models is the ``Dash
30'' has wing slats to improve the wing's lift. The Dash 10 is an
older model with a wing design considered more susceptiable to loss
of lift from ice buildup.
   James E. Madsen, Continental's assistant chief DC-9 pilot at
Denver, minimized handling difference between the Dash 10 and Dash
30s in his testimony.
   ``A DC-9 is a DC-9. There are some differences they (pilots)
should be aware of,'' Madsen said.
   Early theories of what caused Flight 1713 to roll violently and
crash seconds after liftoff included ice buildup on the wings,
turbulence from a jumbo jet that had just landed on a parallel
runway 1,600 feet away, and pilot error.
   Continental's de-icing procedures at Stapleton also came under
scrutiny. Flight 1713 waited between 24 and 27 minutes for takeoff
after it had been de-iced.
   Survivors offered conflicting testimony on the amount of snow
and ice buildup on the wings.
   ``I wondered at one point, `Is that ice?' But I decided it was
just wet,'' said Dr. Fred Helpenstall of Nampa, Idaho, who suffered
broken ribs in the crash.
   Airman Greg Wadsworth of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho
said he had a clear view of the wing before takeoff.
   ``It was like the snow was starting to pile up (on the wings). I
was very concerned but I said it under my breath,'' he testified.
   Other testimony attributed Flight 1713's delay between de-icing
and takeoff on miscommunciation in the control tower and between
the tower and aircraft.
   NTSB investigators refused to speculate on any of the suspected
causes.
   ``Our minds are still open. We will make no final conclusion
until the time we make our final report,'' Nall said.

   The snowstorm that battered the Plains spread snow across
central Minnesota into northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan on
Saturday, but it was weakening with wind not blowing as strongly as
the day before.
   Snowfall amounts across central and northeastern Minnesota
ranged from 6 to 12 inches and northern Wisconsin got from 3 to 8
inches.
   Up to 6 inches of snow was expected over Michigan's Upper
Peninsula while freezing rain and sleet moved across northern Lower
Michigan.
   During the morning, wind in Minnesota gusted from 25 to more
than 50 mph but by afternoon the peak gusts were down to about 40
mph.
   Wind gusts in Wisconsin were clocked at from 20 to 30 mph at
times.
   Gusty wind also blew around the west side of the storm system,
with gusts of 55 mph at Mitchell, S.D., during the morning. Gusts
to 35 to 45 mph were reported across the eastern Dakotas into
eastern and central Nebraska, western and northern Kansas into
northwestern Missouri and western Iowa.
   Temperatures were in the single digits across the northern
Plains, combining with the wind to produce wind chill factors as
low as 30 below zero during the afternoon.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered ahead of a cold
front that extended from southeastern Wisconsin into the lower
Mississippi Valley, accompanied by brief heavy rain, small hail and
gusty wind across northeastern Louisiana into west-central
Mississippi.
   The heaviest rainfall reported during the six hours up to 1 p.m.
EST was 0.53 of an inch at Texarkana, Ark.
   The heaviest snow during the same period was 6 inches at
Marquette, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to 85 at McAllen,
Texas. The low for the day was 20 degres below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Sunday, snow showers were forecast across the Great Lakes
region with rain changing to snow over the eastern Great Lakes and
northern New England. Showers were forecast from the upper Ohio
Valley into central and southern New England. Scattered showers
also were forecast over the middle and southern Atlantic Coast
region.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were predicted across the northern
Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes region;
in the 60s from the central Pacific Coast over western and central
Texas and the central Gulf Coast to the middle Atlantic Coast; in
the 70s over the southern California coast, desert Southwest, the
southern tip of Texas and northern Florida and the southern
Atlantic Coast; in the low 80s over the southern half of Florida;
and in the 30s, 40s or 50s across most of the rest of the nation.

   Hundreds of Palestinian policemen in the
occupied territories resigned Saturday to protest Israeli treatment
of Palestinians, prompting fears that other Arab employees of the
government also would quit.
   Israel radio said close to 450 of the roughly 1,000 Arab police
officers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have quit their
jobs in the past two days and more resignations are expected.
   Israeli and Palestinian officials said at least 330 had resigned
and the resignations would take effect Monday.
   Israeli bullets and beatings have killed 87 Palestinians in
anti-occupation unrest since Dec. 8.
   The resignations began Friday, one day after underground leaders
of the disturbances in the occupied territories called on the Arab
policemen to resign immediately. Some officers reported that their
lives had been threatened.
   Israeli warplanes, meanwhile, struck at guerrilla targets east
of the port town of Sidon in southern Lebanon, the army command
said.
   Israel television reported that at least eight people were
killed in the air raid, Israel's second this year against
Palestinian targets in south Lebanon. Sidon police said at least
one guerrilla was killed and eight were wounded.
   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and seriously wounded a
Palestinian from the village of Bani Naim, near Hebron, after he
threw a hand grenade at them, the army command said. The grenade
did not explode.
   At Nur el-Shams, near Tulkarem, a 50-year-old woman was wounded
when prison service employees opened fire after their bus was
stoned.
   Thousands of Israeli Peace Now demonstrators gathered in Tel
Aviv to urge Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to support a U.S. peace
initiative that would allow limited self-rule for the Arabs in the
occupied lands.
   Peace Now organizers estimated the crowd at 100,000. A reporter
for the daily Yediot Ahronot put the figure at 70,000. Police
refused to give an estimate.
   Israel's right-wing factions have called for a
counter-demonstration in the same place on Sunday evening, a few
hours before Shamir leaves for a visit to Washington to discuss the
plan.
   The continuing unrest in the occupied territories appears to be
putting a severe strain on Israel's defense forces.
   The weekend edition of Yediot Ahronot, the country's largest
newspaper, carried at least four ads offering security-related jobs.
   One ad sought recruits for a new police anti-terror unit.
Another asked for Arab-speaking officers holding the rank of
captain or major for ``special work involving contact with the
local population.''
   Other ads offered jobs to Arabic language translators along
Israel's northern border and civilian guards to protect the
Israeli-Egyptian border.
   The mass resignation of Palestinian police officers will add a
new strain and could be the harbinger of larger and more serious
defections to come.
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said the mass resignations ``will
vastly affect the process of the courts in the West Bank, and it is
a precedent for many more civil servants to resign.''
   About 18,000 Palestinians work for the military government in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   National police spokesman Adi Gonen warned that the resignations
would hurt the Palestinians themselves.
   ``The (Arab) police were not used for intelligence purposes, to
put down protests or for anything political,'' said Gonen. ``If
they quit, we will have to reduce police activities and that will
affect the quality of Palestinian life.''
   Last week, 40 Arab tax collectors in the Gaza Strip left their
jobs after Palestinian protesters threatened their lives.
   The resignations indicated the growing loss of control by Israel
over the occupied territories and deprived it of a potent symbol of
cooperation and coexistence with the Palestinians.
   A survey by The Associated Press indicated that most of the 250
policemen in the southern part of the West Bank have handed in
their resignations.
   Arab police at the Ramallah station said all 50 policemen were
quitting. Freij said that all 50 policemen in his district had
resigned. The Arab-run Palestine Press Service put the figure in
Hebron at at least 68.
   Mordechai Bareket, police spokesman for the southern section of
the occupied West Bank, said ``over 100 policemen'' handed in their
resignations over the past two days.
   Israel radio reported that 100 policemen in Gaza and 30 in the
northern district of the West Bank also said they were leaving the
force.
   Police spokesmen said they were trying to persuade the
Palestinian police officers to change their minds.
   ``We are talking to each one of them individually and looking
into each of their problems,'' said Chaim Alter, commander of the
northern West Bank police district.
   The order to resign was issued Thursday by the National United
Command of the Uprising.
   Mustafa Adani, who resigned Friday, said his life had been
threatened twice.
   Earlier this week, a policeman from the Aqbat Jaber refugee camp
near Jericho was killed.

   The company that operates the federally owned
Fernald uranium-processing plant violates its own regulations and
puts its workers' health at risk, a new government report concludes.
   The report says the U.S. Department of Energy, which owns the
plant, and Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the private
contractor that runs it, should work harder to eliminate potential
worker health hazards at the facility's Feed Materials Production
Center.
   The 37-year-old plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati,
processes uranium for use in the government's nuclear weapons.
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, part
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, issued the
preliminary report last week on the basis of a December inspection
conducted at the request of labor unions at the plant.
   Its final report is not due out for three more months, but
Westinghouse says it has already responded to the institute's
findings by making some rule changes at the plant.
   The report said plant employees sometimes leave portable
air-breathing equipment lying out in areas containing loose and
radioactively contaminated dust, which could get into the
respirators and ultimately into workers' lungs.
   ``Given the fact that many surfaces in the plants where we made
measurements are radiologically contaminated, it is imperative that
workers store their respirators in a clean location when not in
use. This practice should prevent inadvertent ingestion of
radiation-contaminated materials,'' wrote the industrial hygienists
who prepared the report.
   Many surfaces in the plant are contaminated with radioactive
substances from the plant's years of service and require cleanup,
the federal hygienists said.
   They said they found Westinghouse technicians who violated
company regulations and created a potential health hazard by
smoking, eating and drinking while handling and counting
radiological samples.
   ``Surely, such a practice needs to stop immediately,'' the
investigators wrote.
   They also urged improving workplace ventilation in some areas of
the plant. And they recommended that the Department of Energy
improve its supervision of worker health and safety by assigning a
health physicist to the plant.
   The investigators lauded Westinghouse, however, for improving
worker health and safety since taking over operation of the plant
in January 1986 from the previous contractor, National Lead of Ohio.
   Westinghouse spokesman Pete Kelley said the report made no major
criticisms of his company.
   Westinghouse has responded to the federal report by banning
smoking, eating and drinking in the radiological sampling area,
Kelley said. Leaving respirators in potentially contaminated areas
is a violation of Westinghouse policies, he added.
   The spokesman also noted that Westinghouse has increased the
staff of health physicists since it took over the plant's operation.

   A confident George Bush predicted
Saturday that victory in the Illinois primary election Tuesday
would ``cinch the Republican nomination'' for him.
   Campaigning in the heavily Republican northwest Chicago suburbs,
the vice president preached GOP unity and all but ignored his rival
candidates, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and former TV evangelist Pat
Robertson.
   ``I want to be your president,'' Bush said to a cheering crowd
at St. Viator High School. ``I do not want to do it by tearing some
other Republican, by weakening the party that needs to be
together.''
   Bush so far has won 705 of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the
GOP nomination.
   Dole and Robertson also campaigned in Illinois Saturday, with
Dole conceding, ``We're hanging by our fingernails.''
   Bush, appearing with his wife, Barbara, Illinois Gov. James R.
Thompson and pilot Chuck Yeager, began his day with a breakfast
appearance before the Barrington Area Chamber of Commerce, before
speaking to a partisan audience of about 600 at McHenry County
College.
   ``You give me this vote on Tuesday and it seems to me I will
cinch the Republican nomination,'' Bush said.
   The vice president was buoyed by results of a Chicago Tribune
poll published its Sunday editions. The poll of 504 Republicans
showed Bush ahead of Dole 62 percent to 28 percent among those
likely to vote Tuesday.
   Robertson was a distant third with 6 percent.
   The survey, conducted in the past week, had a margin of error of
plus or minus five percentage points.
   Bush has rejected Dole's bid for a face-to-face debate in
Illinois.
   On Saturday, he talked mostly about what he would do if he
captures the White House.
   ``On the deficit, we've got to whip it,'' he said, promising not
to raise taxes to do it.
   ``It is public enemy No. 1. The answer to the deficit is simple,
hold the line on taxes. You're not paying too little in taxes,
we're spending too much in Congress,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi stood before a
cheering crowd Saturday and tore up a list of names of Libyans
banned from travel abroad and ordered their passports returned, the
Libyan news agency JANA reported.
   Gadhafi was quoted as telling a mass gathering in front of the
passport office in the capital, Tripoli, that ``there must be no
citizen jailed or banned from traveling abroad ... in the society
of freedom.''
   The JANA report, monitored in Rome, did not say how many names
were on the list Gadhafi destoyred. It said destruction of the list
and the return of the passports were another step in the ``festival
of freedom'' that began when Gadhafi ``stormed the prison,
demolishing it and liberating the prisoners.''
   Earlier this month, Gadhafi used a bulldozer to knock down the
wall at a prison in Tripoli to release prisoners as part of an
amnesty he declared. JANA said 400 prisoners were freed.
   It also said 130 foreigners of various nationalities were
released from prison last Monday.
   In London, the Foreign Office said James Abra, a 59-year-old
British engineer employed by the British electronics firm Plessey
Company, would be freed Sunday. Abra has been serving a life
sentence for alleged spying.
   He was arrested June 20, 1985, at the Tripoli Airport.

   Murray M. ``Buddy'' Weiss, a former editor
of The International Herald Tribune, died of cardiac arrest
Saturday at Arlington Hospital in this Washington suburb, his wife
said. He was 64.
   Weiss, who was working for the U.S. Information Agency at the
time of his death, had suffered a stroke Friday while playing
tennis, said Fred Farris, the U.S. editor for the Herald Tribune.
   The New York native served as the editor of the Paris-based
newspaper from its creation in 1966 until February 1979, said his
wife, Margaret Sunde Weiss of Falls Church, Va.
   Weiss had received his undergraduate degree from New York
University and a graduate degree from New York University, and
during World War II, he served with the 8th and 9th Army Air Force
from 1942-45, she said.
   In 1946, he joined the New York Herald Tribune as a copy boy and
moved up the ranks during the next 20 years, eventually becoming
managing editor, the job he held when the paper folded in 1966, she
said.
   At one point during his tenure there, he took off six months to
work for The New York Times, where he helped plan that newspaper's
West Coast edition, Mrs. Weiss said.
   After the New York Herald Tribune closed and before becoming
editor of the International Herald Tribune, he spent six months as
assistant publisher for the Boston Herald and the Boston Traveler.
   When he left the International Herald Tribune, he returned to
the United States and became editor of The Advocate in Stamford,
Conn., until 1981, when he became managing editor of Parade
magazine. He left Parade in December 1983 and joined USIA the next
month, she said.
   At USIA, he was in charge of the news file that is distributed
to all U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions around the world,
Farris said.
   In addition to his wife, Weiss is survived by a daughter, Brenna
Weiss of New York City, son Dieter Weiss of Marietta, Ga., two
grandsons and two sisters, Phyllis Weiss Golden of East Orange,
N.J. and Natalie Weiss Davis of Remsenburg, N.Y.

   A car with a device stored in the trunk
containing mildly radioactive material was stolen, and the thieves
could be harmed if they tampered with the devide, federal officials
said Saturday.
   The car, which was stolen Thursday night, had a measuring device
containing cesium-137 and americium-241, said Karl Abraham, a
spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Philadelphia.
   Abraham said the material was inside a 30-inch-high yellow
plastic case bearing a ``radioactive'' label and a federal
Department of Transportation sticker.
   ``It's perfectly safe to pick up and carry the case around,''
Abraham said. ``The radioactive sources are not all that powerful.''
   The substances were part of a moisture density gauge that
measures the compaction and moisture content of materials used in
constructing roads, Abraham said. The car is owned by an employee
of Soils Engineering Services Co. in Whippany.
   A person ``would have to tamper with it and take the radioactive
sources out of a safe container and carry them in one's hands for
several hours before there would be the possibility of radioactive
injuries,'' said Abraham.

<HEAD>Simon Blasts Dukakis, Rallies Troops, But Loses Newspaper
Endorsement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon, facing the pivotal battle of his
presidential campaign, accused Democratic rival Michael Dukakis on
Saturday of trying to buy the Illinois primary with TV commericials.
   The Simon campaign, already cash-poor, also was buffeted by the
results of a new poll showing the Illinois senator's support
slipping in his home state just three days before the election.
   He also lost key newspaper endorsements _ to Dukakis in the
Chicago Sun-Times and to Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in the
Chicago Tribune.
   Still, Simon pressed on, enlisting three congressional allies
from industrial states with pending primaries to push his theme
that the post-Super Tuesday campaign marked the start of a second
phase in the nominating process.
   Simon attacked the Massachusetts governor for a new television
advertising assault that Simon's campaign views as a swipe at their
candidate.
   ``You ought to win an election _ not buy an election,'' Simon
said at a news conference at De Paul University.
   The Dukakis ads do not name Simon but criticize his strategy of
remaining in the race until the Democratic convention in July in
hopes of being the consensus candidate in a brokered nomination.
   Simon said he will not respond with his own television
commercials.
   ``Whatever decision the people of Illinois make, I urge that you
not sell your heritage for a 30-second commercial,'' Simon said.
``The question Illinois voters must ask themselves is not who has
the slick commercials, but who can best represent us in the
presidency.''
   U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz, campaigning for Simon in Chicago, said
the Illinois primary would be either ``the political equivalent of
Custer's last stand or the Battle of Gettysburg'' for Simon.
   ``I trust and hope that for Paul Simon the Illinois primary on
Tuesday will be the political equivalent of the Battle of
Gettysburg, marking the turning point in the campaign leading to
his ultimate nomination at the (Democratic) convention,'' Solarz,
D-N.Y., said.
   But the Sunday editions of the Chicago Tribune brought bad news
for the Simon campaign. Simon shrugged off the paper's endorsement
of Gore, but the poll results showed further erosion in his support
among registered Democratic voters.
   In the poll of 501 Democrats, 35 percent supported Simon, 30
percent favored Illinois' other favorite son, Jesse Jackson, and 18
percent liked Dukakis.
   The results made the race essentially a dead heat between Simon
and Jackson because the poll, conducted March 9 and 10, has an
error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Otto von Habsburg, ex-pretender to the
Austrian throne, made a triumphant return Saturday to the former
imperial Hofburg palace, from which his ancestors ruled a vast
empire for centuries.
   The son of the last Austrian emperor, Karl I, von Habsburg was
greeted with cheers and a standing ovation by about 1,600 people
crowded into a main hall.
   Uniformed students threw their caps into the air and a brass
band played as von Habsburg entered the hall.
   Von Habsburg, 75, made the appearance to mark the 50th
anniversary of the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany and
addressed the crowd as president of the International Pan-European
Union.
   The Habsburg family ruled much of central Europe for more than
600 years. The monarchy was abolished in 1918 at the end of World
War I. Otto von Habsburg was barred from Austria until 1961 when he
renounced his claim to the non-existent throne.
   Most members of the Pan-European Union in Austria and parts of
West Germany are elderly monarchists. One of their declared goals
is the unification of western and eastern Europe without the Soviet
Union.
   Von Habsburg's eldest son, Karl, is head of the union's Austrian
branch and welcomed guests to the palace gathering.
   Speakers condemned the Nazi rule of Austria and referred to van
Habsburg as ``royal highness.''
   None of the speakers mentioned President Kurt Waldheim, who has
come under increasing pressure to resign because of allegations
about his past while serving in the German army in the Balkans
during World War II.
   In his speech, von Habsburg said, ``The past shows that
diversity can only be preserved in unity. A good example for that
was the old Austria, that community of Danube peoples, in which
many nations were united economically and politically.''
   Von Habsburg holds a West German passport. He is still a subject
of controversy between Austrian conservatives and socialistts.

   A U.S. military team flew to Vietnam
Saturday to discuss the Southeast Asian nation's accounting of
Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War, a U.S.
official said.
   The regularly scheduled talks in Hanoi follow Vietnam's
repatriation on March 2 of what it believed were the remains of 17
American MIAs.
   It was the largest turnover in two years and the fourth largest
since the war ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over
U.S.-backed South Vietnam. The United States lists nearly 1,800
Americans as missing in Vietnam during the war.
   Ross Petzing, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the team is composed of six experts from the Joint Casualty
Resolution Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory,
both based in Hawaii.
   ``The team is presenting cases on Americans missing from the war
in Indochina for Vietnamese investigation,'' Petzing said.
   He said the talks with Foreign Ministry officials, scheduled to
extend through Tuesday, would be the fourth round of technical
discussions since Vietnam agreed last August to resume cooperation
on the issue.
   As part of the agreement, a U.S. medical team visited Vietnam
earlier this month to study how private American assistance could
help war-disabled Vietnamese.

   A 73-year-old woman was found alive and
apparently unharmed Saturday after spending as many as four nights
locked in her car trunk by an alleged kidnapper, state police said.
   Martha Bushnell of Arkville was rescued from the trunk of her
compact car shortly before 9:30 a.m., about three hours after a
33-year-old woman was arrested on a charge of kidnapping her.
   Police believe Bushnell had been in the trunk since Tuesday
night, with no food or water and with overnight temperatures
dipping below freezing, said state police Sgt. Al Dorer in
Middletown.
   She was lucid and coherent when she was found and did not appear
to be injured, but she was admitted to St. Luke's Hospital in
Newburgh, police said. ``She was in pretty good condition,
considering her ordeal,'' said Dorer. The hospital would not
release details on her status Saturday evening.
   Investigators were questioning her to determine what had
happened, according to state police Sgt. Bob Parlett in Ithaca.
Details of the incident were still sketchy Saturday, and police
would not speculate on a motive.
   Police had initiated a statewide search for Bushnell after her
car was seen parked on a Newburgh street Wednesday morning, said
Dorer. Two girls had heard cries for help from the car and had
flagged down a taxi driver to help. The driver called police, but
when they arrived the car was gone, Dorer said.
   Parlett said Bushnell, who lives alone, had last been seen
around noon Tuesday at the Valkyrian Motel in Fleischmanns, where
she works part-time.
   At 6:30 a.m. Saturday, authorities arrested Jamesetta Marie
Strong, 33, of Otego, after acquaintances reported seeing her
driving the Bushnell car in the Newburgh area, Parlett said.
   Police found the car later Saturday morning in the parking lot
of a knitting mill, Dorer said.
   ``When they popped the trunk, there she was,'' Dorer said. ``The
first words out of her mouth were `Thank you.'''
   Strong was sent to Otsego County Jail without bail after being
arraigned on a charge of first-degree kidnapping, Parlett said.

   Yunis Khalis, the chief of the
seven-party Afghan opposition alliance, resigned Saturday for
health reasons, an alliance statement said.
   It gave no further details and did not announce a replacement.
   The statment said the Hezbi Islami party, which Khalis heads,
will remain in the alliance and did not say if Khalis also resigned
as party leader.
   His resignation came less than a week after another rebel leader
quit the alliance over plans to form an interim Afghan government
when Soviet troops withdraw from the country.
   But Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, head of the National Liberation
Front, rejoined the alliance three days after resigning.
   Khalis, a Moslem clergyman, was born in 1919 in the village of
Gandumak in the Afghan province of Nangarhar. He was elected to
head the alliance in October 1987. Most of the alliance members
have headquarters in Pakistan.
   Recent developments within the alliance coincide with United
Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva between Pakistan and
Afghanistan's Marxist government to end the Afghan war and and pave
the way for the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet military
personnel.
   The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to help the government
battle the anti-communist guerrillas.
   The rebels are suported by the United States, China and Pakistan.

   Vice President George Bush would defeat
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis if the presidential election
were held today, according to a Newsweek poll released Saturday.
   But a growing number of people think Bush should disclose more
about the Iran-Contra affair, the poll showed.
   Seventy-four percent of the respondents said they are pleased
with the field of candidates now running and would not like to see
an undeclared candidate enter the race, the survey showed.
   Republican Bush would get 49 percent of the vote to Democrat
Dukakis' 43 percent if the general election were held today, the
survey indicated.
   For the poll, the Gallup Organization interviewed 755 voters by
telephone Thursday and Friday. The margin of error was plus or
minus four percentage points.
   Bush would win 55 percent to 37 percent if matched against
Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, while the vice
president would win 58 percent to 35 percent if Jesse Jackson were
the Democratic nominee, the poll said.
   In a race between Dukakis and Republican Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, Dukakis got 45 percent and Dole 44 percent, within the
poll's margin of error. Dole would defeat Gore, 53 percent to 34
percent; and defeat Jackson 58 percent to 32 percent, the poll
showed.
   According to the survey, 50 percent of the respondents said Bush
should tell the public more about the role he played in the sales
of arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels, and 42 percent said he had done enough explaining.
   A Newsweek poll taken in January showed respondents split evenly
at 44 percent on the issue.
   Bush got higher marks for being ``strong and forceful'' in this
survey than he did in polls taken by the magazine two months ago
and in October 1987. In the post-Super Tuesday poll, 46 percent of
the respondents agreed with that description of the vice president,
compared with 36 percent in the two previous polls.

   Five buses used to transport
workers at a nuclear power plant were set afire Saturday night, two
days after the government said construction could resume there, the
ANSA news agency said.
   The Italian agency said the buses were burned inside the
compound of the Montalto Di Castro nuclear plant and were owned by
the Central Nuclear Consortium, which is building the facility 50
miles north of Rome.
   Strong Socialist Party opposition to resuming construction at
the plant was one factor that led to the resignation of Christian
Democrat Premier Giovanni Goria Friday night.
   Goria, leader of the coalition government since August, resigned
twice before, the last time in February, but agreed to stay on to
help pass the national budget. The budget was passed Thursday and
Goria had been expected to resign next week. Politicial leaders
said he decided to quit immediately because of the controversy over
construction at the plant here.
   The government announced a moratorium on construction at the
plant last November after voters in a non-binding referendum
expressed their disapproval of nuclear power facilities.
   On Thursday the government said construction could resume at the
plant, which already has cost Italy $5 billion.

<TEXT>
   A huge chemical fire emitting potentially
dangerous fumes forced the evacuation of about 500 residents for a
time Saturday as it destroyed a huge warehouse and set fire to two
homes.
   Ten people including seven firefighters were injured in the fire
at the Werco chemical warehouse complex, authorities said.
   The evacuees were allowed to return home later in the day but
were instructed to boil drinking water into Sunday, said Lynn
Behringer, spokeswoman for the Will County Emergency Services and
Disaster Agency.
   Strong winds blew smoke and sparks directly into the downtown
area of Rockdale, a town of about 2,000 residents southwest of
Chicago, and exploding chemicals punctuated the flames.
   ``It looked like the Fourth of July,'' said Mrs. Behringer.
``Considering the magnitude of this fire and the number of homes so
close, we are very lucky.'' Of the two homes set ablaze, one was
heavily damaged.
   The warehouse complex, which covered several square blocks,
stored some 60 kinds of chemicals for various businesses.
   Village President Donald B. Gould said police began evacuating
residents about 5 a.m. because of the potential danger from the
fumes, although the identity of the full range of chemicals was not
known. The evacuation area eventually covered two square miles,
officials said.
   After the evacuation order was lifted, residents were told to
boil drinking water because of low water pressure from the
firefighting.
   The cause of the fire and the dollar loss were not immediately
determined.
   Seven firefighters and three other people were treated and
released at hospitals in Joliet and Morris, spokesmen said.

   The Sandinista government announced
Saturday it has formally agreed to hold the first cease-fire talks
inside Nicaragua with rebel leaders.
   It said the talks will be held March 21-23 in the southern
frontier post of Sapoa, 90 miles south of Managua.
   President Daniel Ortega ordered local civilian and military
authorities in the area ``to lend all facilities to the delegation
of the counterrevolution'' to enter and leave the country freely at
the Pena Blanca border crossing, according to a statement issued by
his office.
   The statement said the government would assume all
responsibility for the security of the rebel delegation during the
negotiations and cross-border traffic would not be affected.
   Adolfo Calero, the top political leader of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, is expected to head the delegation from the rebels,
known as Contras. Nicaraguan Resistance is an umbrella organization
of rebel group.
   Ortega previously announced that his brother, Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega, would lead the government delegation.
   The Sapoa meeting also will be the first between the two sides
without a mediator.
   Calero told The Associated Press recently that the Sapoa talks
would take place with ``an open agenda.'' He said Joao Baena
Soares, secretary general of the Organization of American States,
and Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo would attend as
witnesses.
   Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua, mediated previous
talks held in the Dominican Republic and Guatemala.
   Calero said a representative of Nicaragua's internal opposition
also would be invited to attend. A Contra representative in Miami,
who spoke with the condition he not be identified, told AP Saturday
the Nicaraguan Resistance still was insisting that a domestic
opponent of the Sandinistas be present at the talks as an observer.
   Ortega's statement did not mention that demand.
   Both sides had tentatively agreed to meet in Sapoa for three
days of direct negotiations beginning March 9. Ortega canceled that
schedule after the rebels said they would not attend without
preliminary discussions.
   Ortega dismissed Obando y Bravo as mediator on March 2 after the
cardinal proposed an agenda that included discussion of internal
politics.
   The Contras previously had insisted on the presence of Obando Y
Bravo, a frequent critic of the left-wing government.
   Contra spokesmen also insisted Ortega's government agree to
discuss the political points outlined by Obando y Bravo during the
last cease-fire talks held Feb. 18 in Guatemala.
   The cardinal's plan would have required the Sandinistas to grant
amnesty to political prisoners, restore full press freedom, open
talks with internal opposition political parties and review the
military draft law.
   The Sandinistas have refused to discuss internal political
issues with the Contras, saying the only purpose of the talks is to
work out a cease-fire in accordance with the regional peace plan
signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of the five Central American
countries.
   Roger Guevara, secretary of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Coordinate, a coalition of opposition political parties and
business and labor groups, said his organization would send a
representative to the talks but as a participant, not as an
observer.
   In a broadcast over the Rebels' Radio Liberacion, Guevara said
``in spite of the fact there does not exist an official invitation,
the Coordinate is ready to assist in this reunion.''
   Obando y Bravo told local reporters Saturday he was willing to
attend as a witness. ``I would like these talks to advance so that
they redound to the benefit of the Nicaraguan people,'' he said.

   Jesse Jackson won the Democratic precinct
caucuses Saturday in his native South Carolina, giving his campaign
a push just before a pivotal primary in Illinois, the state he has
adopted as his home.
   Jackson jumped to an early lead and held it, receiving his only
competition from a bloc of uncommitted party members, whose numbers
lagged far behind those of his supporters.

   More than 1,100 anti-nuclear protesters,
including actress Teri Garr, actor Robert Blake, disc jockey Casey
Kasem and activist Daniel Ellsberg were arrested Saturday at the
nation's nuclear testing grounds.
   Nye County authorities estimated the crowd of protesters at
3,000, well below the 5,000 to 10,000 organizers predicted would
come to the remote site 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Saturday's demonstration, dubbed ``Reclaim The Test Site,'' was
part of a 10-day protest at the site through March 20. By late
afternoon the number of arrests had reached 1,136 and continued to
grow, said Department of Energy spokesman Chris West.
   Protesters climbed barbed wire fences surrounding the
1,350-square-mile site, began walking across the desolate desert
and were arrested by waiting authorities. Some 300 officers from
the Nevada Highway Patrol, Nye County Sheriff's Office and
Department of Energy security were on hand.
   Miss Garr, Blake, Ellsberg and Kasem were arrested when they
stepped across a cattle guard on the road leading to the main
entrance of the desert site.
   The crowd cheered as each group of protesters stepped across the
guard.
   Miss Garr was asked if she thought joining the protest would
hurt her movie career. ``I hope not,'' she said. ``I don't think
you have to be a fanatic to think nuclear weapons are going to
annihilate the Earth.''
   Those arrested were placed in two large enclosures, then bused
to Tonopah and released, West said. All were cited for misdemeanor
trespass. Authorities no longer prosecute misdemeanor arrests for
trespassing.
   Authorities took extra precautions for the rally, building an
8-foot chain-link enclosure topped with barbed wire to hold
detainees.
   Americans for Nuclear Testing held a counterdemonstration
Saturday, but organizer Peggy Konold said she expected her group to
be far outnumbered by the anti-nuclear protesters.
   Protests at the site have been common in recent years. Jesse
Cocks, an organizer with the American Peace Test, said her
organization counted 2,547 trespassing arrests in 1987.

   With 38 percent of the state's 1,788 precincts reporting,
Jackson won 3,455 county convention delegates for 48 percent,
followed by uncommitted with 1,643 delegates for 23 percent.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was in third place with 1,434
delegates for 20 percent.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon all trailed with support
measured in single digits.
   The outcome of the precinct caucuses will affect how 44 of the
state's delegates to the Democratic National Convention will be

   Before Saturday's caucuses Jackson already had won 400.55
national convention delegates, second only to Dukakis, who had
460.5.

<HEAD>Film Actor `Divine' Eulogized At Funeral</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Divine, the outlandish 375-pound cult film
star, was eulogized for his talent, gentle manner and individuality
during funeral services Saturday that attracted hundreds of fans,
friends and colleagues.
   ``He was a friend, business partner, co-conspirator and actor
who could say the words I wrote better than anybody,'' said John
Waters, who directed Divine in such cult classics as ``Pink
Flamingoes,'' ``Polyester,'' ``Lust in the Dust,'' and the
just-released ``Hairspray.''
   ``How many people at age 42 love their job as much as he did? He
was happy, talented, successful, and a true original,'' Water told
mourners, some with rainbow-hued hair and others in suits and ties,
at a funeral home in this Baltimore suburb.
   Divine, a Lutherville, Md., native whose real name was Harris
Glenn Milstead, died Monday in his bed at the Hollywood Regency
Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County coroner's
officer determined he died of an enlarged heart due to obesity. The
Friday before his death a doctor had said Divine was in perfect
health except for his weight, which had been a problem for the
actor all his life.
   Divine was known mostly for his outrageous roles as loud and
foul-mouthed women in Waters' films, although he also played a male
Sidney Greenstreet-type character in the 1985 film ``Trouble in
Mind.''
   The Rev. Leland Higginbotham, pastor of the Calvary Baptist
church to which the Milstead family belonged, described Divine's
youth as an ``agonizing period'' during which the budding actor
``took a painful and circuitous road to find himself and his
talents.''
   Divine's popularity had grown with ``Hairspray,'' a relatively
mainstream film that was attracting more traditional movie
audiences. Waters said Divine was thrilled with the success, noting
that ``people who had hassled him in high school were asking for
his autograph.''
   Flowers were sent by such entertainers as Whoopi Goldberg, Elton
John, and the cast of Fox Television's ``Married ... With
Children,'' the program on which he was scheduled to appear the day
after his death.

   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, saying ``the issues
are more important than the odds,'' went on television for 30
minutes Saturday in an effort to reverse the decline in his
presidential prospects.
   Standing in front of a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, Dole said,
``I know I'm the underdog in this race. The issues are more
important than the odds. ... I didn't expect this job to be handed
to me in the first place.''
   Dole spoke from Alumni Hall at Knox College which was the site
of the fifth of the seven debates in 1858 between Lincoln and
Stephen Douglas during their campaign for the Senate. Dole's
address was televised in Illinois.
   Vice President George Bush, who has refused to respond to a Dole
challenge for a one-on-one debate before the Illinois primary on
Tuesday, was the featured speaker at a dinner on the campus shortly
after the Dole program aired.
   Dole spoke as a new survey said Bush was the choice of 62
percent of likely Republican primary voters. Only 28 percent named
Dole as their choice.
   ``It just seems to me we should have had a debate,'' said Dole.
``My opponent is less than 100 yards away as I speak.''
   Actually, Bush was not scheduled to arrive until after Dole left.
   ``Nothing has ever come easy for Bob,'' said his wife,
Elizabeth. ``His only inheritance was the love of his parents.''
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, you're going to be voting Tuesday and we
want you to know more about Bob Dole's life,'' she said,
introducing a 14-minute segment from a biographical sketch filmed
for showing to Dole campaign meetings.
   But her remarks were never seen by WGN viewers because of a
technical problem that cut off the live picture for about two to
three minutes, said Raymond Kirk, the master controller for the TV
station.
   The station froze the last live shot of Dole and kept it on the
screen while viewers also heard his voice.
   Then the station switched to the biographical sketch, bypassing
Mrs. Dole's introduction. The program concluded without further
problems.
   A poll published in the Sunday edition of the Chicago Tribune
said the vice president was the choice of 62 percent of Republicans
likely to vote in Tuesday's primary. Dole was named by 28 percent
and Pat Robertson by 6 percent.
   The survey of 504 likely GOP voters was conducted Wednesday and
Thursday.
   During campaign appearances on Friday, Dole conceded he was
``hanging by our fingernails.''
   The senator, who took a drubbing on Super Tuesday this past
week, losing 16 of 16 primaries to Bush, needed a victory in
Illinois to maintain any faint hope that he can stage a comeback in
the presidential race.
   Bush, campaigning in northwest Chicago suburbs, predicted
Saturday that victory in the Illinois primary election Tuesday
would ``cinch the Republican nomination'' for him.
   The vice president preached GOP unity and all but ignored Dole
and Robertson.
   ``I want to be your president,'' Bush said to a cheering crowd
at St. Viator High School. ``I do not want to do it by tearing some
other Republican, by weakening the party that needs to be
together.''
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 705 and
Dole 163. A total of 1,139 delegate votes would be needed at the
GOP convention in New Orleans next August to win the presidential
nomination.
   Larry McCarthy, communications director for the Dole campaign,
said $100,000 was spent to purchase one half-hour on Chicago
television station WGN and additional time slots Sunday and Monday
on other stations around the state. He said the amount also covered
the production costs.
   Campaign manager William E. Brock said the broadcast would be
repeated Sunday on other stations around the state.
   Brock also said that contrary to earlier statements from
campaign officials, other Dole commercials were running in Illinois.
   Earlier in the week, the campaign had said that all commercials
in a total buy of $500,000 had been pulled off the air.
   Brock said some were pulled off, but others _ biographical spots
portraying Dole as a strong leader _ were continuing to run. He
said some commercials were dropped when it was decided to use part
of the media budget for the half hour program.
   ``We need to somehow capture the attention of the Illinois
voters,'' said Dole, who has repeatedly challenged Bush to a
one-on-one debate. The vice president brushed off the challenge,
saying he already has participated in seven debates and called them
``cruel and unusual punishment.''
   The only encouragement Dole could get from the Tribune poll was
the response when Republicans were asked if they agreed with the
statement that it was ``important for the Republicans that Bob Dole
does well in Illinois so that the Republican presidential campaign
continues.'' A total of 56 percent said they agreed, while 30
percent said they disagreed.
   Other findings strongly favored Bush.
   When people were asked which candidate they considered ``tough,
a strong leader,'' 45 percent named Bush and 32 percent Dole.

   Jim and Tammy Bakker's PTL-owned
five-level house will be put on the auction block on April 12, with
the minimum price set at $995,000.
   The money will go to help the PTL ministry based in nearby Fort
Mill pay its debts.
   Dave Huneycutt of Lake Wylie Realtors said he's had about 55
inquiries about the house since the auction notice appeared
Tuesday. They include ``doctors, lawyers, well-known sports
promoters and very successful independent business people,'' he
said.
   The 10,226-square-foot house was built in 1976 and enlarged four
times after PTL bought it in 1981 as a parsonage for the Bakkers
and their two children.
   The master bedroom has his and hers bathroom suites, connected
by a sunken whirlpool tub. The tub is flanked by a glass-enclosed
rock garden. Faucet handles are in the shape of long-neck swans.
   The Bakkers apparently shared a 600-square-foot carpeted clothes
closet that adjoined her dressing room. Large mirrors abound _ in
the music room, the exercise room, the bathrooms and other areas.
   The house has a commercial kitchen with heavy-duty appliances,
two additional kitchens and at least 25 closets. Electronically
controlled draperies and curtains are in most major rooms,
including his study and the master bedroom.
   The massive house sits at the bottom of a steep hill and fronts
Lake Wylie in one of Tega Cay's most exclusive sections.
   The grounds include a two-story playhouse that is heated and
air-conditioned, a guardhouse, boardwalks to a white sandy beach at
the water's edge, and a large dock where the Bakkers once kept
their 58-foot houseboat and small power cruiser.
   The Bakkers left the home last June, three months after Bakker
admitted to a 1980 sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica
Hahn and resigned.
   The Bakker home is one of 10 PTL properties that will be sold
April 12 at the Tega Cay Country Club, according to auctioneer
Rodney Robinson.

   The government placed Colombia's
150,000-member armed forces on alert as voters prepare to vote
Sunday to elect mayors for the first time since independence from
Spain 169 years ago.
   The campaign to elect mayors in 1,008 municipalities has drawn
violence from leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers and right-wing
death squads. The election is the first real challenge to
upper-class control of local government.
   Until now Colombia's mayors, with the exception of Bogota, have
been named by governors, who are appointed by the president. The
president chose the mayor of Bogota.
   In the election, Colombians also will choose 10,543 councilmen,
421 state assembly representatives and 89 assemblymen from remote
territories.
   National police were included in the military alert. All leaves
and days off were canceled.
   Broadcast reports said soldiers were patrolling cities and towns
from the Amazon jungle area in the south to the Guajira desert
region in the north.
   In the capital of Bogota, a city of 6 million people, jeeps
mounted with machine guns cruised streets and police stopped cars
and searched them for guns and explosives.
   Leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads have killed
scores of political activists in the last year.
   Two months ago drug traffickers kidnapped Bogota's leading
mayoral candidate, Andres Pastrana, because he had spoken out for
stronger action against the traffickers. Police later freed
Pastrana, the son of former president Misael Pastrana.
   Polls have indicated that Pastrana, the only Conservative Party
candidate, will win.
   The Liberal party mayoral candidates in Bogota are Bernardo
Ossa, who was president Virgilio Barco's emissary for talks with
leftist guerrillas; Juan Caicedo, former president of Colombia's
Federation of Businessmen, and Jorge Eastman, a former Cabinet
minister.
   Newspaper polls indicate that the leading contenders among
lower-class voters are two women.
   One, Maria Eugenia Rojas, running as an independent, is the
daughter of a 1950s military dictator, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla.
   The other woman is Clara Lopez, an independent supported by the
Patriotic Union party, which was formed three years ago by leftist
guerrillas.
   The Patriotic Union's president, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa,
predicted his party will win 25 mayoral posts.
   In a broadcast interview Saturday with the Colombian radio chain
RCN, he called upon his leftist coalition party ``to overcome fear
and threats'' and go to the polls.
   Right-wing death squads have killed 520 members of the party
since it was formed in 1985 with the help of Colombia's estimated
10,000 leftist guerrillas.
   The government of former president Belisario Betancur, in an
effort to negotiate peace, allowed the rebels to form the party.
Betancur's government also agreed to election of mayors, a goal of
Colombia's leftists.

   Leftist guerrillas claimed
responsibility Saturday for detonating two car bombs in a trendy
shopping and restaurant area.
   ``The peace of the rich has ended, the war of the poor has
begun,'' said a communique issued by the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, an alliance of five leftist guerrilla groups that
has been fighting to overthrow El Salvador's U.S.-backed government
for the past eight years.
   Two car bombs went off Friday night in the Pink Zone, a
fashionable neighborhood of sidewalk cafes and restaurants. Two
people were injured.
   The statement said the blasts targeted ``those who daily plan
the repressive campaign against campesinos, those who fly the
helicopters and planes, the diplomats, Marines of the U.S. Embassy,
and the demagogues who design electoral campaigns.''
   The campaigns mentioned referred to legislative and municipal
elections scheduled for March 20.
   ``These individuals have never felt the consequences of misery
and exploitation and, being parasites, much less have felt the
ravages of the dirty war they impose on the humble people. With
this action we intend to make them feel, if only a little, this war
they direct comfortably from afar,'' said the communique.
   An anonymous caller told the radio station YSU where to find the
communique, and a reporter for the station picked it up.
   One of the bombs exploded just a few feet from where leftist
guerrillas killed 13 people, among them six Americans, in a machine
gun attack in June 1985.
   A 12-year-old boy and a middle-aged man were slightly wounded in
the first explosion Friday. The other bomb exploded about five
minutes later in a parking lot behind a Pizza Hut restaurant,
causing no injuries.
   An armed forces spokesman consulted by The Associated Press said
explosives experts were studying the vehicles' remains.
   The conservative daily La Prensa Grafica on Saturday had
attributed the blasts to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front.
   ``The object of these actions ... is to demonstrate that the
terrorists continue attacking the citizenry in an effort to disrupt
the elections,'' said the paper.
   One blast destroyed three vehicles and shattered windows.
   It occurred in front of a restaurant that adjoined the cafe
where four off-duty U.S. Marines and two American businessmen were
killed along with seven Salvadorans in 1985. Leftist guerrillas
claimed responsibility for that attack.

   Gallaudet University's embattled board of
trustees planned to meet Sunday to discuss picking a new president
for the school for the deaf just days after massive student
protests prompted the hearing person chosen for that post to resign.
   Students at the nation's only liberal arts school for the deaf
said Saturday they hoped the meeting will bring about their demand
for the nation's first deaf university president.
   The university was shut down for five days last week by student
protests after Elisabeth A. Zinser _ who can hear and does not know
sign language _ was appointed by the board last Sunday over two
deaf candidates.
   Faced with student outrage, Zinser stepped down early Friday.
``My decision to resign was reached with great difficulty as I came
to understand how deeply some see the social stature of deaf
persons reflected in the presidency of this university,'' she said
in a statement.
   The two deaf candidates who were bypassed last week are being
reconsidered for the position. They are Harvey J. Corson, 44,
superintendent of the Louisiana School for the Deaf in Baton Rouge
and a Gallaudet board member; and I. King Jordan, 45, dean of
Gallaudet's College of Arts and Sciences. Both are Gallaudet
graduates.
   Students in the Deaf President Now Committee last night asked
for mediation with the board to resolve the students demands:
   ``That a deaf president be appointed from the two finalists;
that board Chairwoman Jane Bassett Spilman resign from the board of
trustees effective immediately; that the bylaws of the board of
trustees be amended to reflect a majority of deaf voting members,
to be achieved within a specific period of time; and that no
reprisals be taken at any time against any student, faculty or
staff member of Gallaudet University.''
   Gallaudet has never had a deaf president in its 124-year
history. The college was founded by Congress in 1864, and became a
university by an act of Congress in 1986.
   The federally supported institution receives 75 percent of its
budget from Congress.

<TEXT>
   Romare Bearden, a pre-eminent American artist
whose collages fashioned stories about the dignity of black people
and Southern living, died Saturday. He was 75.
   Bearden died about 1 a.m. at New York Hospital of complications
from bone cancer, diagnosed two years ago, and a stroke suffered
last month, said his manager of 13 years, June Kelly.
   Works by Bearden, who was awarded the National Medal of Arts by
President Reagan last June, fetched prices at Sotheby's up to
$56,000, among the highest prices paid for works by black artists
in the United States.
   Bearden's work ranged from political cartoons published in 1934
to water colors and eventually the collages. He had one-man shows
at the Museum of Modern Art and several top galleries.
   He was a lover of jazz who did sets and costumes for the Alvin
Ailey Dance Theater, and murals for the Baltimore and Pittsburgh
transit systems.
   ``I think certainly that he's one of the great masters of the
20th century, especially over the last 40 years,'' said Lowery
Sims, associate curator of 20th century art at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
   Sims said Bearden's work in collages ``raised it to such a fine
art it's hard to think of any other artist who is so closely
associated with that medium.''
   Sims, who compared his use of form and color to that of Henri
Matisse, said Bearden's work had an unparalleled ability ``to
provide us with a heroic depiction of even the most mundane aspects
of American black life.''
   ``I think that he was trying to make us conscious of the
richness of part of the black heritage we wouldn't think ordinarily
of,'' Sims said. ``I think he made us aware that we are a very
important part of American culture.''
   In the book, ``The Art of Romare Bearden,'' by John A. Williams,
Bearden said, ``I work out of a response and need to redefine the
image of man in the terms of the Negro experience I know best.''
   Ralph Ellison, author of ``Invisible Man'' and a friend from the
1930s, said that in the artist's work, ``restlessness was not
frivolous, it was the discovery of the self, of the paintings, of
the design.''
   Bearden, who was born in Charlotte, N.C., grew up in Harlem and
in Pittsburgh. He attended Boston University and New York
University, majoring in mathematics and planning to become a
doctor. He started drawing in college and cartoons published in the
Afro American, a weekly, led to his career in art.
   He gained prominence in the 1940s after his work was included in
a show by black artists in Washington in 1943.
   He is survived by his wife, Nanette. A memorial service was
being planned for later in the month.

   A major snowstorm that dumped up to 7 feet of snow shut down
travel in the upper Midwest Saturday and whipped up 15-foot waves
on Lake Superior, while crews worked to reopen highways across the
Plains where hundreds of people had been snowbound for two days.
   ``It's a little better than yesterday but not much,'' said
Roberta Welsh, Nebraska State Patrol dispatcher at Scottsbluff.
   A South Dakota woman was killed Saturday when her car skidded
and rolled over on an icy interstate, the state Highway Patrol said.
   High school basketball fans spent the night stuck in a Minnesota
arena after a regional playoff, and two busloads of Nebraska
schoolchildren snowbound at isolated farms got to go home.
   Up to 7 feet of snow stranded skiers on Terry Peak in South
Dakota's Black Hills and 15-foot drifts were reported near Badlands
National Park. In the hard-hit Nebraska Panhandle, 31 inches of
snow was reported at Chadron, with 10-foot drifts at Crawford.
   The Cheyenne County, Neb., sheriff's department worked through
the night and all day Saturday to reach people believed stranded in
vehicles in the Sidney area, said dispatcher Harlan Sage.
   ``We'll be lucky if we don't find someone out in the country ...
dead possibly,'' said Kimball ambulance director Jim O'Brien and
Kimball County Sheriff John Thacker Jr. They said the storm was the
worst to hit western Nebraska in at least 18 years.
   An elderly couple from Springview, Neb., were rescued Saturday
by a relative on a snowmobile after spending the night stuck in
their pickup, said Keya Paha County Sheriff Gary Sell.
   Blowing snow kept visibility down to about one-quarter of a mile
around O'Neill, Neb., forcing the town to cancel its annual St.
Patrick's Day celebration, said Holt County sheriff's dispatcher
Arlene Fox.
   More than a foot of snow fell Saturday in sections of northern
and central Minnesota, and it was whipped up by 50 mph wind that
closed the Duluth airport for six hours. Waves estimated at 15 feet
topped some seawalls along Lake Superior, the National Weather
Service said.
   Hundreds of Hutchinson High School girls' basketball fans,
including the school band, were stranded overnight in Mankato,
Minn., by snow and zero visibility after a victory in regional
playoffs. The seven busloads of fans stayed in Mankato State
University's arena while the team got motel rooms. The motel said
they checked out Saturday morning.
   Up to 10 inches of wet snow was dumped on northern Wisconsin,
miring countless vehicles on highways near Lake Superior.
   ``It looks like everybody's on an ego trip, wanting to see how
far they can go'' before their cars get stuck, said police Capt.
Jerry Moe at Superior, Wis., just across the lake from Duluth.
   Snow also fell across northern Michigan. ``We're getting a
blizzard,'' said state police Sgt. Larry Brown at St. Ignace at the
southeastern tip of the Upper Peninsula.
   On Terry Peak in the Black Hills, skiers had been snowbound
since Thursday, and Terry Peak Lodge manager Bob Ekeren said 7 feet
of snow had fallen by Saturday. ``We're out of bread and meat and
potatoes. We're making soup.''
   ``There's three, four feet of snow on top of cars. We can't even
find them,'' Ekeren said at the lodge, at an elevation of 6,700
feet.
   Crews in Wyoming, Nebraska and South Dakota worked Saturday to
reopen roads that had been closed by drifting snow and zero
visibility, some since Thursday.
   More than 200 miles of Interstate 80 across Wyoming and into
western Nebraska reopened Saturday and north-south I-25 was
reopened in Wyoming. But many other roads in eastern Wyoming
remained closed, the Highway Patrol said.
   The reopening of I-80 allowed travel for the first time since
Thursday out of Kimball, Neb., where some 700 people had been holed
up by Saturday in motels, private homes and the Kimball County
Courthouse. ``We're getting some people down the road,'' said Carl
Farmer of the sheriff's office.
   Conditions in Kimball were ``a tad better. We can see across the
street but we've got a long ways to go,'' said a woman who answered
the phone at the Kimball civil defense office Saturday morning.
   A 200-mile section of I-94 in North Dakota, closed Friday
afternoon, was reopened Saturday. Parts of a 265-mile section of
I-90 in South Dakota were reopened but a 75-mile section between
Kadoka and Ellsworth Air Force Base remained closed, with 15-foot
drifts in the Kadoka area, said Highway Patrol Lt. Ed Assman.
   Residents of Rapid City, S.D., began digging out under bright
sunshine but some people were stranded in their homes with drifts
up to the second floor.
   The storm caused the South Dakota Democratic Party to postpone a
statewide caucus called for Saturday, when the party was to decide
how to apportion 15 of the state's national convention delegates.
The caucus was rescheduled for the following Saturday.
   Two busloads of children who had been stranded in isolated
farmhouses in western Nebraska since Thursday got home safely
Saturday afternoon. The 21 children were being driven home from
school when the sudden blizzard caught the drivers by surprise.
   Road crews reached driver Sharon Grubbs and her riders, ages 7
to 13, Saturday at the farm of Jack and Karen Holt, about 17 miles
from Harrisburg. All the children left the farmhouse and Ms. Grubbs
said she probably would try to drive the school bus home Saturday
night.
   Mrs. Holt and her visitors were without electricity from
Thursday night to Saturday morning.
   Driver Linda Barrett and her 13 passengers were able to leave
Agnes Wynne's farm when roads were cleared Saturday.
   A neighbor on a snowmobile took buffalo meat, eggs and bread to
the Wynne farm Saturday morning because food was running short,
Mrs. Barrett said.

<HEAD>Announces Discovery of World's Largest Uncut Diamond</HEAD>

   The De Beers diamond firm has
announced the discovery of an egg-sized, 599-carat diamond and said
it is currently the world's largest uncut diamond with an estimated
cut value of $30 million.
   Officials of the South African company said the white diamond,
dubbed ``The Big Rock,'' was found at a mine near Pretoria in July
1986, but its discovery was kept secret to all but a handful of De
Beers executives.
   De Beers' chairman Julian Thompson announced the find at the
firm's 100th anniversary banquet in Kimberly Friday night.
   ``It's a perfect blue-white color,'' said South African gem
expert Gaby Tolkowski, who will cut and polish the stone.
   There have been larger raw diamonds uncovered previously, but
they were cut into smaller gems.
   The 1988 Guinness Book of World Records recorded the Cullinan
diamond as the world's largest uncut diamond ever found. It was
discovered in 1905 near Pretoria and weighed 3,106 carats, or more
than 1.25 pounds.
   The Cullinan was cut into 105 stones, including the 530.2-carat
Star of Africa, the world's largest known cut diamond, according to
Guinness. The Star of Africa is the centerpiece of the British
royal scepter.
   In its cut form, the ``Big Rock'' is expected to be about 350
carats and sell for an estimated $30 million, the company said.
   DeBeers is the world's largest diamond company and controls an
estimated 80 percent of the world's diamond production through its
central selling organization in London.

   Two busloads of children who had been
snowbound at farms for two nights finally made it home Saturday
when snowplows cleared the roads.
   The 21 children and two bus drivers had taken refuge at the two
homes during a raging snowstorm Thursday afternoon, and had passed
the time playing games and listening to a battery-operated radio.
At one farm, electrical power was off for more than a day and meals
were cooked on a campstove.
   Drivers Linda Barrett and Sharon Grubbs were taking children
home from the Banner County school in Harrisburg when the heavy
snow and winds gusting to 55 mph enveloped their buses, reducing
visibility to zero.
   ``The storm hit a little faster than we thought,'' said Ms.
Grubbs, who was in radio contact with Mrs. Barrett when they
decided to find shelter rather than continue.
   Ms. Grubbs and her eight children wound up at the farm of Jack
and Karen Holt, about 17 miles west of Harrisburg. One of the
maintenance workers who cleared the roads Saturday was the father
of two of the stranded children, Mrs. Holt said.
   All the children left Saturday, including one who had to wait
until her parents, stranded elsewhere by the storm, made it home.
Ms. Grubbs said she would probably drive the school bus home
Saturday night.
   Power at the Holt farm was out from Thursday night until about
7:30 a.m. Saturday. It was about 38 degrees in the house before the
heat came back on.
   ``We're all so thankful for the heat,'' said Mrs. Holt. ``We're
fed and warm and wonderful.'' Power was lost again about 2 p.m.,
but the house was staying warm, she said.
   The two women used a camping stove to cook meals as the
children, ages 7 to 13, huddled under blankets. The three boys and
five girls played games and listened to a battery-operated radio,
Mrs. Holt said.
   ``They've been super for us,'' said Ms. Grubbs, a 10-year
veteran bus driver. ``They've cooperated so well.''
   Mrs. Barrett and her 13 passengers waited out the storm at Agnes
Wynne's farm, about 20 miles from Harrisburg. A snowplow cleared
the road about 3 p.m. Saturday, Mrs. Wynne said.
   Mrs. Wynne, who lives alone, said having so many children on
hand ``was a little trying. But they were a good bunch of kids.''
Worries that she wouldn't have enough food were eased when a a
neighbor brought over buffalo meat, eggs and bread on his
snowmobile.

<TEXT>
   A major brush fire that destroyed tens of
thousands of acres of West Texas prairie land appeared under
control late Saturday afternoon, officials said.
   For parts of Friday and Saturday, the fire seriously threatened
the towns of Albany and Moran in Shackelford County and Baird in
northern Callahan County, but three tanker airplanes helped contain
it by dropping fire-retardant chemicals.
   At least 265,000 acres were burned, and officials said the dry,
windy weather continued to pose a danger that the fire could
rekindle.
   Sam Logan, public information officer for the Texas Forest
Service, said the grass fires that ravaged much of Shackelford
County and parts of Callahan and Throckmorton counties since
Thursday were under control and the Forest Service was beginning
its mop-up operation.
   ``That'll take about two days,'' Logan said. But he added,
``We'll continue to keep an eye on it, because with the strong
winds and low humidity, just a spark could start it up all over
again.''
   Most of the fires appeared to be interior ones that appear
likely to burn themselves out where they were, officials said.
   ``We've pretty well got fire guards around the complete fire.
Tonight, we're going to just more or less be running a patrol and
mop-up operation,'' said Baird Fire Chief Pat McKennon. ``We will
have Forest Service crews out and some local fire units out, just
more or less patrolling.''
   National Guardsmen and other military personnel used heavy
equipment such as bulldozer and scrapers to build fire breaks.
   ``The idea is to get the grass down real short so that if a fire
jumps a street it doesn't ignite,'' said Airman 1st Class William
Cross from Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene.
   The fire killed livestock, burned trailer homes and oilfield
equipment and closed roads across parts of an area 60 miles long
and 25 miles wide, officials said.
   About 265,000 acres of rangeland had burned in Shackelford
County alone, or roughly half the county, said Joe Fox of the Texas
Forest Service. Albany, a town of about 2,500, is the county seat.
Smaller acreages were burned in the other two affected counties,
officials said.
   At a 3,000-acre ranch south of Albany, workers moved about 100
head of cattle away from the blaze while a U.S. Forest Service
crew, with three bulldozers, fought flames earlier Saturday that
had rekindled in a pasture.
   ``It looks worse at night because that's when you can see the
flames. During the day, the smoke covers everything,'' said Wanda
Sims, a part-owner of the Dyer-Sims Ranch. ``The night before last,
it looked like hot lava moving down the hills.''
   Volunteer firefighter Phillip Rodriguez said he and hundreds of
other workers stopped the flames just inside the city limits of
Baird, a town of about 1,700 people, about 7 a.m. Saturday.
   ``When it was dark, all you could see was orange rolling down
the hills,'' said Rodriguez.
   ``Smoke is drifting across Baird. It is like we are having a big
wienie roast out here,'' said Callahan County Sheriff's Officer Jan
Davis.
   Some homes were evacuated Friday night in the Hannersville
section of Baird and authorities set up a command post, but no
dwellings were lost in the community 21 miles east of Abilene, said
Ms. Davis. Residents returned to their homes Saturday.
   But in Albany, 25 miles north, the fire consumed trailers and
oilfield equipment, and its relentless march eastward earlier in
the day Saturday, fanned by strong winds, had worried authorities.
   ``There's plenty of damage to rangeland, oilfield equipment _
including storage tanks _ and some trailer houses,'' said Albany
Mayor Wayne Hogan. ``We are still trying to get it under wraps
after three days. But it seems to be under better control than this
time yesterday.
   ``But if the wind changes, which it can do real sudden, we're in
trouble again,'' he said.
   In Moran, a town of about 340 people 16 miles southeast of
Albany, Morris Snyder Jr. gazed with neighbors through a smoky haze
at a long bluff a few miles away, pointing toward a line of flames.
   ``This is the worst anyone living here has seen,'' he had said,
before the situation was reported under control. ``It's the worst
anyone can remember.''
   Federal officials, at the request of Texas emergency management
officials, approved aid to help reimburse the state for expenses in
fighting the blaze, which began Thursday from a trash fire.
   Murry Fly, a spokesman for the Texas Forest Service in Lufkin,
said crews arriving from around the state gave tired Forest Service
crews, volunteers and National Guardsmen the chance to rest.
   Numerous firefighters, among hundreds battling the blaze, have
suffered injuries from smoke inhalation and minor burns, said Tom
Millwee of the Division of Emergncy Management.
   An aircraft tanker containing 2,000 gallons of fire retardant
chemical arrived Saturday from the U.S. Forest Service in Fort
Smith, Ark., said Millwee.
   `We are trying to survey the burned area from the air because
you still can't drive through most of it,'' said Hogan, the Albany
mayor. ``We lit backfires last night to protect rural houses just
west of the city limits to stop the flames, advancing from the west
and northwest.''
   Elsewhere, another range fire in Val Verde County, about 300
miles to the southwest, consumed about 60,000 acres before it was
brought under control.
   Mike Scott, a spokesman with the governor's office of emergency
management, said Saturday night that National Guard troops sent to
the area had been released.
   ``There is still apparently some fires down there, but it's
minor,'' Scott said.

   Jesse Jackson easily won the Democratic precinct caucuses
Saturday in his native South Carolina, while Sen. Bob Dole went on
Illinois television for a half-hour plea for Republican votes in a
state where he said he is the underdog.
   Jackson took a commanding lead in the caucuses and maintained a
better than 2-1 margin over the uncommitted, who represented the
second-largest bloc of delegates being elected to county
conventions in South Carolina.
   With 78 percent of the precincts reporting, Jackson was winning
53 percent of the delegates to the county conventions, while the
uncommitted trailed with 20 percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore was
in third place with 19 percent and other candidates were far behind.
   Dole, who spoke while standing before a portrait of Abraham
Lincoln on the site where Lincoln and Stephen Douglas held one of
their famous debates, told Illinois voters, ``I know I'm the
underdog in this race.
   ``The issues are more important than the odds,'' Dole said. ``I
didn't expect this job to be handed to me in the first place.''
   The Kansas senator, who earlier acknowledged that his
presidential campaign is ``hanging by our fingernails,'' invested
$100,000 in the broadcast in an attempt to stop the momentum of GOP
front-runner, Vice President George Bush.
   A Chicago Tribune poll published in Sunday editions said Bush
was far ahead of Dole while homestate Sen. Paul Simon was leading
the Democratic field, followed closely by Jackson.
   The newspaper also endorsed Gore in the Democratic contest,
passing over native Simon and Jackson, who has made Illinois his
adoptive home state.
   ``I dare George Bush to debate Bob Dole,'' Dole told a news
conference. In originating his broadcast from Knox College in
Galesburg, he had picked the time and site to conform to Bush's
appearance at the same location, he said.
   Gore, whose success in Southern primaries on March 8 catapulted
him into contention in the Democratic race, was counting on another
boost from South Carolina.
   ``We have worked very hard in this state and I think we have an
opportunity to extremely well here,'' Gore said during an
appearance in Columbia, S.C.
   But favored to get a majority of the 44 delegates at stake in
South Carolina was Jackson, a native of Greenville.
   Jackson trailed Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis by 58 in the latest
Associated Press delegate count. Strong showings in South Carolina,
where he was born, and Illinois, which he now calls home, could
propel Jackson into the delegate lead in the Democratic race.
   Appearing at a meeting of the South Carolina Education
Association, Jackson said, ``I'm delighted to be home again. You
taught me. You can have somebody in the White House that you
taught.''
   Rival Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri has the support of
former Govs. Robert McNair and Richard Riley, and is a strong
backer of legislation to limit textile imports, an important issue
in South Carolina.
   Gore said he too supported the legislation.
   Bush crushed his Republican opponents in the South Carolina GOP
primary last Saturday.
   Simon was banking on Illinois voters in Tuesday's primary to
give their home state senator enough support to keep him in the
race.
   Dukakis, Jackson and Gephardt made forays Saturday into
Michigan, where Democrats hold caucuses March 26.
   Jackson addressed the graduation at Michigan State Unversity,
recalling the tumult of the civil rights movement and calling on
graduates to work for more than material wants.
   ``A generation of young Americans died, sacrificed to keep
America better and make America strong,'' he said. ``Your
generation must resist the dangerous trend of surrendering to the
war of the opiate and the war of selfishness and the war of conceit
and use your strength to take the torch another lap in this great
struggle.''
   Dukakis visited the 250-worker Olofsson Corp. plant, which makes
exotic, computer-controlled machines, and said the United States
needs to re-invest in its industrial base.
   Dukakis, seeking Michigan union support against stiff
competition from Gephardt and Jackson, said he plans to target his
message to working people, teachers, homemakers and professionals.
   In Illinois Dukakis began airing a new commercial that appeared
to be a veiled attack on Simon who has been saying he thought the
Democratic nominee would be chosen at a brokered convention.
   The ad did not name Simon, but said some people want to return
to ``the days when you didn't really pick the presidential nominee.
They say you must turn over the power to them to use at a brokered
convention ... On Tuesday you can pick the next president. Mike
Dukakis is running for president in every state in America.''
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published Sunday showed Simon
supported by 39 percent of the 540 likely Democratic voters
interviewed on Thursday and Friday. Jackson had 32 percent in the
poll, followed by Dukakis with 15 percent, Gephardt with 5 percent
and Gore with 3 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or
minus 7 percentage points.
   After campaigning in the city's ``Greektown'' region on Friday
night, Dukakis stopped Saturday at an Italian bakery on the city's
west side to help bake bread. He offered a modest goal for Illinois.
   ``If we can get some share of the delegates, I think it would be
great,'' he said.
   Bush has repeatedly rejected Dole's debate challenges.
   ``That ploy has been used before,'' he said. ``Debates are cruel
and unusual punishment. We've already had seven of them.''
   Republican candidate Pat Robertson also was in Illinois and
insisted he did not need a victory in the state to remain the race.
   ``It looks strong for me in the West,'' he said. If he loses the
fight for the GOP nomination, said Robertson ``I'll dust myself off
and be right back in it in 1992.''
   In the GOP race, Bush has 705 delegates, while Dole was a
distant second with 163. Robertson has 17.
   Meanwhile, a Newsweek poll released Saturday showed that Bush
would beat Dukakis, Gore or Jackson if the presidential election
were held today. The telephone survey of 755 voters Thursday and
Friday had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The poll also indicated that Dukakis would beat Dole, but only by 1
percentage point _ within the survey's margin of error. Dole would
beat either Gore or Jackson, according to the survey.

   A bomb exploded Saturday near a polling
booth in Dhaka, killing one person and wounding three as
Bangladeshis cast ballots in nine districts where voting had been
postponed because of earlier violence.
   Police said Borhanuddin Ahmed, 25, was killed in the explosion
in downtown Dhaka.
   At least 13 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in
violence during the parliamentary elections held on March 3, and
the government stopped and rescheduled the voting in 125 districts.
Elections were held in nine districts Saturday, but no results were
reported.
   The major opposition parties boycotted the elections.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya Party won 245 seats
in the 300-member parliament in the March 3 balloting, according to
results announced by the government. It said a coalition of 73
smaller groups and parties won 15 seats and independent candidates
won 15.
   Ershad's party plans to celebrate its victory with prayer
meetings on March 16. Opposition parties have called for protest
rallies on March 24, the sixth anniversary of the bloodless coup
that brought Gen. Ershad to power.
   Leading the opposition campaign are Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia
who have demanded that Ershad resign.

Trail Sled Dog Race surrendered the lead Saturday after setting the
pace for more than 400 miles, and the leaders raced down the frozen
Yukon River.
   Joe Redington lost the lead to Martin Buser, who left Galena
with his dogs about an hour ahead of Redington. They were still
about an hour apart when they reached Nulato, 52 miles downstream
and 400 miles from the finish in Nome.
   The race started in Anchorage on March 5. The first musher to
Nome will collect $30,000 of a $150,000 purse; the next 19
finishers will split the rest. Three of the 52 teams that started
the race have dropped out, including one Saturday.
   Redington, who founded the race in 1973, has never won, although
he has competed in all but two Iditarods.
   Redington had a 4{-hour lead when he left Ruby on Friday evening
but Buser, who moved to Alaska from Switzerland in 1979, made up
time during the night. Redington dropped one dog in Galena, leaving
him with just nine. Buser also dropped one, but still had 14 in
harness.
   ``I tried to travel with Joe Redington from Cripple, but he
disappeared in a hurry,'' said veteran Herbie Nayokpuk. ``I never
saw him again. He has the dogs. If he gets those dogs running to
Nome, he's going to be a hard one to beat.''
   Rick Swenson of Two Rivers and Susan Butcher of Manley, the only
mushers ever to win the marathon race more than once, arrived in
Galena about an hour before Buser left. Swenson, a four-time
winner, and Butcher, who won the last two races in record time,
each had 13 dogs.
   Nayokpuk, who had been near the lead throughout, checked in at
Galena at midmorning, and by afternoon, 10 mushers had reached
there.
   ``Don't write off anybody that's three or six hours off the pace
right now,'' said one of them, Jerry Austin of St. Michael. ``We're
just inching our way up. We're steadily gaining on them.''
   Jacques Philip, of Thomery, France, led the foreign mushers in
15th place. Horst Maas, of Lenz, Austria, was in 25th; Peter
Thomann of Tagish in Canada's Yukon Territory, was 31st; Ian
Mackenzie of Bruce Mines, Ontario, 41st; Brian Carver of Melbourne,
Australia, 46th; and Lesley Anne Monk of Worsthorne, England, 48th.
   American mushers from outside Alaska were paced by Robin
Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., in 19th place. John Patten of Grand
Marais, Minn., was 27th; Frank Teasley, Jackson, Wyo., 28th; Terry
Adkins, Mikado, Mich., 29th; Dan McEachen, Snowmass Village, Colo.,
32nd; and Stan Ferguson, Philadelphia, 47th.

   The Reagan administration created a new,
permanent Pentagon division to carry out covert paramilitary
operations after the failure of the 1980 attempt to rescue American
hostages in Iran, according to a book to be released in April.
   The lack of coordination that led to the failure in Desert One
during the Carter administration prompted the new administration to
establish Snow Bird, to be run by a group of men in the Army's new
Special Operations Division, says U.S. News & World Report senior
editor Steven Emerson.
   ``The division was created following a decision by the new
Reagan administration to make permanent the counterterrorism,
aviation and special-operations units assembled for the Iran rescue
mission,'' Emerson says in excerpts of his book, ``Secret Warriors:
Inside the Covert Military Operations of the Reagan Era,'' which
were printed in this week's magazine.
   Among other findings in the book, which Emerson wrote based what
he says was a year-long investigation and hundreds of interviews
and thousands of documents obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act:
   _In 1985, U.S. intelligence identified the precise location of
the house where five of the six American hostages were being held
in Lebanon. Identified as ``Building 18,'' the site was
reconstructed by U.S. intelligence agents as part of a portable
mini-model used by U.S. officials to prepare a rescue operation. A
detailed military rescue mission was planned by the Pentagon's
counterterrorist units in 1986, but it was scrapped when the
Iran-Contra affair began to unfold.
   _U.S. officials negotiated with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Libyan intermediaries to obtain the hostages'
release, according to classified portions of private notebooks of
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a National Security Council aide who
was a central figure in the Iran-Contra affair. One plan, which
later collapsed, called for covert payments of a total of $10
million to Sheik Fadlallah, the leader of the Hezbollah
organization holding the hostages and Hussein Massawi, the leader
of the Islamic Amal militia. At U.S. request, the PLO actually
transferred some money to Fadlallah to get the hostages out, but
nothing happened, according to the book.
   _NSC sources said the man behind the kidnapping of the hostages
was a Shiite named Immad Mughniye. However, North said that
Mughniye's wife, whose relative was being held in a Kuwaiti prison
for terrorism, was running the show. ``Ollie said Mughniye wasn't
going to get any sex until his (wife's relative) was released,''
says Emerson.
   _Intra-Pentagon rivalry between counterterrorist organizations
prevented the Pentagon from participating in the search for
kidnapped CIA Beirut station chief William Buckley, who was later
killed.
   _Over several years, Emerson says, the CIA _ despite laws to the
contrary _ exploited the secret Pentagon units to carry out covert
operations in Central America to further the cause of the Contra
rebels fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   Burma's top rebel leaders called
Saturday for a political settlement of the 40-year-old insurgency
and greater autonomy for the country's ethnic minorities.
   Although the rebel's National Democratic Front operates in a
region awash in opium and heroin production, the leaders denied
involvement in drug trafficking. They have been accused of dealing
in drugs to finance their war.
   Democratic Front leaders, in a meeting with journalists in this
Thai-Burmese border town, called on the United States and other
countries to cut support for the regime of President Ne Win.
   Chiefs of the coalition of 10 guerrilla organizations claimed
aircraft provided to Ne Win by the United States to fight the
narcotics trade were being used in military operations against the
insurgents.
   Coalition chairman Saw Mah Reh said the group wanted to
``present its case to the outside world'' and counter government
claims that the insurgency would be crushed within two years.
   He called for peace negotiations to be conducted on neutral
ground with an impartial mediator. Three countries have expressed
interest in the mediation role, he said, but he did not identify
them or elaborate.
   ``The NDP does not want war and desires to end the civil
conflict as soon as feasible,'' he said, calling for a democratic,
multi-party system to replace Ne Win who has presided over
one-party rule since 1962.
   The insurgency began shortly after Burma became independent from
Britain in 1948. Ethnic minorities said the original British
concept of a federal union was changed by central government
leaders.
   Ethnic minority groups represented Saturday were the Mon,
Kachin, Wa, Palaung, Pa-O, Karenni, Arakanese, Lahu and Shan.
   The leaders claimed a rigorous anti-narcotics policy had been
laid down and opium eradication is being pursued.
   They said U.S.-provided helicopters were being used to ferry
troops and ammunition to the battlefield and for medical
evacuation. They also said chemical herbicides provided by the
United States were causing illness among humans and killing
livestock.
   Washington has provided aircraft and herbicides to allow the
Burmese government to spray border areas where opium is grown.
   Knowledgeable Western narcotics sources say that some of the
rebel groups probably are not involved in narcotics trafficking,
but others are instrumental in the flow of opium that is used to
produce heroin.
   The Burmese Communist Party, which also is battling the
government, is regarded by Western diplomats as a major drug
trafficker. The Democratic Front leaders said their ooperations
with the communists were limited to ``military matters.''
   The front claims it has 35,000 guerrillas and they control about
half of the country. Western military analysts say Burma has more
than 250,000 personnel in its military services, police forces and
militias.

<TEXT>
   Hollywood's fabled ``rat pack,'' Frank
Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., arrived here by private
jetliner Saturday night on the eve of a nostalgic North American
tour.
   Their sold-out show Sunday at the Oakland Coliseum Arena is the
first of 40 performances that the stars will perform through Oct.
1. Promoters are billing it perhaps the last chance to see them
together in concert.
   ``It's all about music, three good friends genuinely enjoying
themselves on stage together,'' said Mort Viner, Martin's manager
and coproducer of the tour, last week. ``They'll probably be having
more fun than the audience.''
   Sinatra, 72, Martin, 70, and Davis, 62, first performed together
in Las Vegas in 1960. They went on to make three movies: ``Ocean's
11,'' ``Sergeants Three,'' and ``Robin and the Seven Hoods.''
   Among the other cities slated to be visited during the tour are
Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Washington, New York,
Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, Miami, Philadelphia and Boston.

   A Drug Enforcement Agency officer was arrested
Saturday as the city's police department waged its war against
drugs, dubbed Operation Clean Sweep, police said.
   Ray Murray, 34, of Atlanta, identified as a special agent for
the DEA, was charged with possession of marijuana after police, who
were watching an area of known drug transactions, saw a man
purchase two packets of a substance shortly before 1 p.m., police
said.
   Murray, who was arrested about a block away, was one of 30
people arrested Saturday afternoon on narcotics distribution or
possession charges, police said. He was scheduled for arraignment
Monday.

<TEXT>
   Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth
II, plans to marry the 22-year-old daughter of a Belgian baroness,
a weekly newspaper reported Sunday.
   The People, a London tabloid, said the 24-year-old prince has
proposed to Georgia May, whose mother Catherine was born a baroness
in Belgium's Van den Branden de Reeth family.
   Edward would have to give up his rights as fifth in line to the
British throne if he married Miss May, a Roman Catholic, the
newspaper said.
   Britain's 1701 Act of Settlement rules that only Protestants may
become British monarchs.
   The newspaper said the prince is awaiting the queen's permission
to be formally engaged.
   It quoted Miss May's former boyfriend, New Zealand yachtsman Ed
Danby, as saying she told him of the engagement plan in a telephone
call last week.
   The People said the prince met Miss May at a yachting regatta in
Cowes in southern England last August.

   Thousands of Armenians marched to City Hall
on Saturday, carrying flags and chanting in a show of solidarity
with a Soviet republic involved in a territorial dispute on the
other side of the globe.
   Mounted police kept watch as the demonstrators gathered in
Pershing Square before winding through downtown, singing and
chanting and carrying signs and banners. Police estimated the crowd
at 5,000 people.
   Saturday's protests in California were triggered by rioting that
began late last month in the Soviet Union. Armenians in the port
town of Sumgait, in the Republic of Azerbaijan, demanded that the
region of Nagorno-Karabakh be united with the Republic of Armenia.
Nagorno-Karabakh, populated largely by Armenians, is currently a
part of Azerbaijan.
   Soviet Police and militia have moved into the region to calm
tensions in the adjacent republics in the Soviet Union's southwest
corner. Some reports claim 32 people have died while others put the
death toll much higher.
   ``We want to show our solidarity with our people and the
protests taking place in Soviet Armenia,'' said Lorig Titizian,
executive director of the Armenian National Committee Western
Region, which organized the demonstration.
   The procession to City Hall was led by about 15 black-robed
Armenian priests walking beneath a sign that read, ``No brotherhood
without justice.''
   ``We are marching to express our unity with Armenians living
both in Karabakh and in Armenia and in America,'' said the Rev.
Arsag Chatchadourian.
   Harold Ezell, Western regional commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, was one of the few speakers to address
the crowd in English.
   ``I believe that in the state of California, where we have a
first-generation Armenian as governor ... we should do everything
we can to support our friends,'' Ezell said, referring to Gov.
George Deukmejian.

<HEAD>Meese and Wallach Briefed Peres on Pipeline in 1985</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III and his
friend, E. Bob Wallach, jointly briefed then-Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres in October 1985 about the status of plans for a $1
billion Iraqi pipeline project, The Washington Post said in
Sunday's editions.
   The newspaper said memos written by Wallach and reviewed by the
Post described Peres as enthusiastic and ``intensely'' interested
in the project when briefed on it at an Israeli Embassy reception.
   Wallach, in the memos, said he had given up hope of getting
enough time to brief Peres, when Meese walked up to them and came
to his rescue, according to the Post.
   Wallach said he had been expecting to meet with Peres on the
afternoon of his Oct. 16, 1985 arrival here to discuss the pipeline
project. Peres' plane, however, arrived 90 minutes late and Peres
went directly to the reception.
   Almost 1,000 guests were waiting, ``a mob scene,'' wrote
Wallach, but he waited for a break and managed to get to Peres and
introduce himself, the Post said.
   ``He (Peres) literally dragged me off into a corner at that
moment and began discussing the project intensely,'' Wallach said.
But then a crush of people built up, led by then-Israeli Ambassador
Meir Rosenne, who wanted Peres to meet various members of Congress.
At that point, Wallach said he gave up and Peres asked him to wait
around until after the reception.
   ``Fortunately, as that time approached, my friend (Wallach's
usual phrase for Meese) arrived and there was a three-way
discussion which took approximately 10 minutes,'' the Post quoted
Wallach as saying. ``He (Peres) is very quick and we went right to
the point and he was agreeable in all respects. It wasn't the kind
of briefing I would have preferred, but it seemed to have been
effective.''
   Wallach said Peres later invited him to meet again in New York a
few days later, and Wallach said he did so, accompanied by a
staffer from the National Security Council who had been assigned to
expedite the pipeline plans and its construction by the Bechtel
Group of San Francisco.
   According to a memo composed by Wallach on Oct. 20, 1985, the
meeting at the Israeli Embassy here was more of a ``briefing'' than
a chat.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay is investigating Meese's role
in the pipeline maneuvering to determine whether Meese might have
violated any laws in concert with Wallach, Swiss financier Bruce
Rappaport, or anyone else.
   The pipeline was never built.

   NASA plans to recommend to Congress that a
$1.2 billion, government-owned plant be built to make new booster
rockets for the space shuttle, an idea blasted by a senator from
Utah where the boosters are now constructed by Morton Thiokol Inc.,
according to a published report Sunday.
   ``I suspect that this is one of those crazy ideas that was
dreamed up by some empire-building bureaucrat,'' Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, was quoted by The Washington Post as saying. ``In this
current budgetary climate, we shouldn't even be considering this
kind of nonsense.''
   The plan, which calls for a contractor to operate the
booster-building plant, would end Morton Thiokol's monopoly on the
booster manufacturing. The boosters are now built at a plant in
Wasatch, Utah.
   The newspaper cited an unidentified industry source as saying
that Garn has been threatening to hold up space station funding if
the plan isn't blocked.
   Thiokol has dominated the solid rocket industry since 1973, when
it first won the shuttle rocket contract, but the plan by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration would give other
firms an opportunity to get into the business.
   ``After the space station, this is the biggest initiative we've
got going,'' said Russ Bardos, director of NASA solid propulsion
systems. ``Whoever wins this will be the biggest (rocket)
propellant producer in the country.''
   The proposal already has aroused the interest of four rival
companies, the Post said, identifying them as United Technologies
Corp., Aerojet General Corp.; Atlantic Research Corp. and Hercules
Inc.

   A Florida Air National Guard F-16
fighter crashed Friday in woods, causing its cannon shells to
explode, but the pilot parachuted 2,000 feet to safety, officials
said.
   Lt. Col. Levis DeWeese of Jacksonville told officials the engine
of the $14 million Fighting Falcon stopped. When he couldn't
restart it, DeWeese said, he steered the plane to an unpopulated
area and bailed out.
   DeWeese, 50, suffered minor injuries.
   The crash occurred about 10 a.m. two miles south of Callahan,
said Lt. Col. Durham Searcy, with the Air National Guard at
Jacksonville International Airport.
   The crash touched off a small brush fire. The plane, with the
125th Fighter Group, was armed with 20mm cannon rounds, and the
fire and crash caused them to explode, said Lt. Col. Reubin Owens,
on-scene commander.
   DeWeese was returning from a training mission over the Atlantic
Ocean.

   Democrat Brian Moss on Friday declared his
candidacy for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Sen. Orrin Hatch _
the man who defeated Moss' father for the seat in 1976.
   The 43-year-old son of former three-term Sen. Frank Moss made
his announcement during a spirited student assembly at Granite High
School, where his grandfather was the first principal.
   Moss, who holds a degree in economics, is a travel agent and
part-owner and manager of several sandwich shops. Although his
Republican opponent is leading 2-1 in recent polls on his bid for a
third term, Moss said Utah senatorial races are sometimes
unpredictable, citing his father's surprise defeat 12 years ago by
Hatch.
   Moss said if elected he would use the office of senator to
attract more industry to the state and to eliminate foreign trade
barriers now preventing local farmers and industries from selling
products abroad. He also would like foreign economic competitors to
pay for more of their own military defense.
   Moss denounced President Reagan's ``trickle-down economics,''
saying, ``You do not start building from the roof, you start from
the foundation.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis predicted
Friday he will ``get my share of delegates'' in the Illinois
primary next week against favorite sons Paul Simon and Jesse
Jackson.
   ``If Mike Dukakis won, it would be a turning point,'' Dukakis
told a news conference.
   He said he expects to ``get my share of delegates'' and to prove
``that I can appeal to people all over the country.''
   Polls indicate Dukakis trails far behind Simon and Jackson among
Illinois Democrats.
   The Dukakis campaign began airing a new advertisement that
addressed the prospect of a brokered convention, a theory put forth
in part by Simon's fading campaign.
   ``Some people would like to turn back the clock, to go back to
the days when the voters didn't really pick their presidential
nominee,'' the narrator says on the ad.
   ``They say you must turn over that power to them, to use at a
brokered convention. But you don't have to do that. On Tuesday you
can pick the next president. Mike Dukakis is running for president
in every state in America, for a better economic future for every
American. You decide. Does Illinois pick the next president?'' the
ad says.
   At a speech at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Dukakis
drew parallels between his campaign and that of John F. Kennedy 28
years ago.
   ``Today, as in 1960, we are fighting for the future of America.
Here in the Midwest, the battle has been joined. Here in the
Midwest, the battle must be won and the old ways, as John Kennedy
said 28 years ago, the old ways simply will not do.''

<TEXT>
   The president of the Alabama NAACP and
13 other black lawmakers asked a judge Friday to dismiss
trespassing charges stemming from their bid to remove the
Confederate battle flag from the Capitol dome.
   Defense attorneys invoked claims of legislative immunity from
such misdemeanor charges and said state historians, not Republican
Gov. Guy Hunt, had jurisdiction to order any arrests while the
Capitol is being renovated.
   Prosecutors did not comment on the defense claims at the brief
hearing before District Judge Craig Miller, who withheld a ruling
pending the filing of further briefs.
   Thomas Reed, a lawmaker and state president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, vowed for weeks
to remove the flag on Feb. 2 after the legislature opened. The feat
would require climbing an 8-foot chain-link fence, entering the
locked building, climbing an inner stairwell to the white dome and
taking the banner off a staff.
   Hunt had said anyone who made such an attempt would be arrested.
   Minutes after the Legislature's opening gavel, state police
pulled down Reed and others as they made at least symbolic efforts
to scale the fence. They nevergot near the building and the flag
still flies atop the Capitol dome.
   Each lawmaker was charged with second-degree criminal
trespassing and released from the county jail on $300 bond.
Conviction on the misdemeanor count carries a maximum penalty of
three months in jail and a $500 fine.
   Defense attorney Fred Gray said the legislators cannot be
prosecuted for their attempt to climb the fence because the Alabama
Constitution provides immunity from arrest to lawmakers while the
Legislature is in session.
   The trespassing charges should be dropped because no entry was
made and the Capitol is public property, he said.
   Gray also told Miller that Hunt did not have the power to order
the arrests because the Capitol is under the control of the Alabama
Historical Commission while it is being renovated.
   The NAACP says the flag is a racist symbol of oppression and
slavery. Hunt, who has said the Legislature must decide whether to
remove the flag, has said many view the banner as a historical
symbol of the Old South.
   Despite Gray's arguments, Hunt is standing by his decision to
have the lawmakers arrested, said his press secretary, Terry Abbott.
   ``Our legal research showed that the governor is actually in
charge of very distinct parts of the Capitol,'' Abbott said. ``Most
parts of the Capitol, excluding the floor controlled by the
Legislature ... did fall to the governor.''
   In another case Friday involving the Confederate flag, three bus
drivers in Durham, N.C., said they were fired and at least a dozen
students were sent home after they arrived at school wearing the
flags.
   When some of the Chewing Juniuor High School students and
drivers later gathered at a store near the school, police set up a
roadblock, but they would not say why.
   Alesia Keith, 22, who has driven a school bus for the Durham
County schools for three years, said she had the Confederate flag
tucked into her back pocket Friday as a show of pride, not of
racism. One of the drivers fired was black.
   ``This is Southern Pride Day,'' Ms. Keith said. ``They can take
my job and my money, but they can't take my pride.''
   Schools spokeswoman Alisa Terry said the students were dismissed
for the day because their clothing was considered disruptive.
   ``Administrators are meeting and will discuss with parents what
kind of long-term action will be taken,'' she said.
   She also said no final decision had been made on the status of
the three bus drivers, although they, too, were sent home for the
day.

   A group of dissidents announced Friday the
formation of a small, independent ``university'' with Western
teaching methods to give students an alternative to state-supported
Soviet higher education.
   Lev Timofeyev, a former political prisoner who heads the
unofficial group Press Club Glasnost, said establishment of the
school has not been approved by officials, but he said formal
permission was unnecessary.
   The enrollment will be limited to 70 students. They will begin
English-language training April 1, and an academic year that will
begin in October, Timofeyev said.
   The organizers plan to hold classes in apartments and will not
charge tuition, Timofeyev said. Organizers hope to compensate the
faculty with donations from the West.
   He said the roughly 50 students registered in Moscow and 19 in
Leningrad will be taught by dissidents who have advanced degrees in
physics, mathematics, language, literature and theology.
   But the school, called Moscow Independent University, also hopes
to use Western books and have instruction by Western professors,
either on videotape or in person, he said.
   A member of the group, Valery Soifer, said it already had
agreements for assistance from Long Island University in New York,
Hebrew University in Jerusalem and several French universities.
   Timofeyev is to act as the school's president.
   Glasnost is Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness on selected subjects.

<HEAD>Former Cabinet Minister's Diary Questions Response To 1970 Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau may
not have had grounds for imposing the War Measures Act in October
1970 to deal with Quebec separatists, according to the diary of a
late Cabinet minister.
   The sweeping powers given police by the act led to the arrests
and detention of more than 460 civilians in Quebec. Only 62 were
ever charged and 18 were convicted.
   Trudeau justified his action by saying an insurrection was
taking place in Quebec, a predominantly French-speaking province,
and police lacked the power to suppress it.
   A diary left by former Transport Minister Don Jamieson, who died
in 1986, said two days after Trudeau acted, the Cabinet was told
police had no evidence of an insurrection _ no firearms, ammunition
or explosives.
   Portions of the diary were published Friday by the Toronto
magazine Saturday Night.
   Jamieson's notations marked the first time in 18 years the
official version of events was questioned by a person who was in
the government at the time.
   Trudeau, stopped on a street by a reporter and asked about
Jamieson's conclusions, said, ``Look, I don't want to talk to the
media for God's sake. Read your history.''
   The October crisis began when guerrillas of the Quebec
Liberation Front kidnapped British Trade Commissioner James Cross
and Quebec Labor Minister Pierre Laporte. Cross was freed after two
months but Laporte was killed.
   Jamieson wrote that in his view, Trudeau used the War Measures
Act to assert federal power, not halt an insurrection.
   ``I am satisfied that from the very moment when Cross was
abducted the prime minister saw the incident as an issue on which
we (the Liberal Party government) would stand or fall and through
which he might very well be able to assert the federal position in
a dramatic manner,'' Jamieson wrote.
   Truedeau retired in 1984 and an election returned the
Conservative Party to take over the federal government.
   The separatist movement subsided in Quebec after voters rejected
a 1980 referendum on the issue.

<TEXT>
   At least half of the 600 jobless miners
who crossed the Andes on foot last week to grow coca will be
relocated by the Save the Children organization, it was announced
Friday.
   The miners, many with their families, arrived in the tropical
town of Chulumani 50 miles east of La Paz over the weekend and said
they would grow coca leaves unless the government provided them
with jobs.
   Bruce Harris, director in Bolivia of the Westport, Conn.-based
Save the Children aid program, said arrangements have been made for
at least 300 of the miners and their families to relocate in the
town of Circuata, 30 miles east of Chulumani, where they will be
encouraged to cultivate coffee, citrus plants and bananas.
   He said Circuata residents have agreed to make land available,
the government will assist with building houses and Save the
Children will provide seeds, technical assistence and credits.
   The humid area around Chululmani has been an important coca-leaf
producing zone for generations. A paste is made from the leaves and
then refined into cocaine.
   Since 1985, more than 21,000 employees in the mining work force
of 27,000 have lost their jobs as the government closed 14 of 21
government-owned mines because of the collapse of the tin market
and deficits by the state mining company.
   The government has provided temporary jobs for 6,000 unemployed
miners with funds provided by the United Nations and some European
governments.
   Other jobless miners are living in tent cities on the outskirts
of La Paz or have gone to tropical zones to farm. Coca leaves are a
major cash product in this impoverished country with a population
of 6.4 million.
   ``The reason for our presence in Chulumani is very simple: We
are demanding from the government a solution to our problem,''
Augusto Leon, the leader of a group of miners, said last week.
``All options for finding jobs are closed to us. We have nowhere to
live ... so we have adopted this political decision.''

<TEXT>
   Angola is seeking direct talks with
South Africa on peace in southern Africa because the United States
has lost credibility as a mediator, Angola's industry minister,
Pedro de Castro Van-Dunem, said Friday.
   He told a news conference in Lisbon that his Marxist government
has received signals that some South African officials were
considering the possibility of direct negotiations.
   The minister said Angola wanted to talk directly to South Africa
because the United States lost impartiality as mediator in the
conflict by supplying the Angolan rebel movement UNITA with arms
and by welcoming guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi in Washington
``like a head of state.''
   Angola says 9,000 South African soldiers are in southern Angola
to support UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
   UNITA has fought since 1975 to force Angola's government to
share power.
   The Soviet Union and Cuba support the Angolan government.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan of South Africa has said his
government would consider making a direct deal with Moscow on
ending the war in Angola if a non-aligned government was
established in Luanda.

   Swedish TV said Friday that non-Jews
expelled from the Soviet Union were issued visas to Israel as a way
of inflating official Jewish emigration statistics while getting
rid of dissidents.
   It interviewed Baltic dissidents Friday who said Soviet
authorities gave them visas to Israel when they were expelled even
though they were not Jewish.
   Swedish television said it knew of 47 cases in past months where
non-Jews were registered as Jews in emigration documents and given
visas to Israel.
   Janis Barkans, a Lithuanian nationalist who served six years in
a Soviet prison and was an activist before being expelled, told a
TV reporter Soviet authorities gave him an ultimatum after a
demonstration in Riga last summer.
   ``They told me that either I leave the country or I would go to
prison again ... A Jewish visa arrived automatically shortly
afterward,'' he said.
   Barkans said he was not Jewish and had not asked for such a visa.
   ``I met many Jews in jail. They had been put there only because
they wanted to emigrate to their historical home country,'' Barkans
said.
   The television said at least 32 Lithuanians and 15 Estonians,
all of them non-Jews, were expelled on visas to Israel. Several
came to Sweden.
   According to statistics from the Geneva-based Intergovernmental
Committe for Migration, 8,011 Soviet Jews left the communist
country last year for permanent resettlement abroad, about eight
times the annual rate of the previous five years. In 1986, only 943
Jews were allowed to leave.
   It was not clear whether non-Jews carrying visas for Israel were
included in those statistics.

<TEXT>
   President Blaise Compaore of Burkina
Faso outlined his government's new program Friday and made it clear
that he will give business and foreign interests a warmer welcome
than his predecessor did.
   In a radio broadcast monitored in Abidjan, Compaore said that
with Burkina Faso's ``limited resources, the state alone cannot
pretend to do anything.''
   Compaore led the Oct. 15 coup in which President Thomas Sankara
was killed. It was the fifth coup in the poor West African nation
of 7.5 million since Burkina Faso _ formerly Upper Volta _ won
independence from France in 1960. Both men were army captains and
Compaore was a close aide of Sankara's.
   Sankara had antagonized business people and Western governments
and creditors with his policies and statements attacking Western
imperialism.
   Compaore said Friday his government will work with national,
foreign and private sectors, an apparent reference to his efforts
to improve government relations with national trade unions,
commercial interests and foreign neigbors.
   The new program, published later Friday in the official daily
Sidwaya newspaper, pledged to continue some economic reforms begun
under Sankara.
   The program called for a ``reinforcement of industrial
production and the rehabilitation of factories that are underused
or currently dormant.''
   The plan pledged to ``enlarge and reinforce democracy.'' Its
most striking change was abolition of Sankara's feared
Revolutionary Defense Committees in favor of smaller organizations
with a social and cultural focus. The organizations would be
separate groups of rural peasants, blue collar workers, youth,
civil servants, women and the elderly.
   Compaore avoided offending elements sympathetic to Sankara.
Without directly naming Sankara, he noted his speech borrowed ideas
from the political program Sankara laid out in a 1983 speech made
shortly after taking power.
   Compaore's foreign relations program was more moderate than the
radical policies of Sankara, which criticized France's Africa
policy and its involvement in Chad. The Sankara program troubled
many of Burkina Faso's neighbors, whose relations with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi have been strained.
   Compaore said his program was drawn up after a review of the
four years of Sankara's government. He offered no direct criticism
of Sankara and only briefly referred to his seizure of power as a
``rectification process.''
   Compaore also pledged to continue the government crackdown on
corruption and laziness begun when Sankara took power in 1983.

<TEXT>
   The United States has begun testing two
types of single-use syringes to help stop the spread of AIDS and
hepatitis transmitted by contaminated needles, an American official
said Friday.
   Alan Woods, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, announced the disposible syringe tests at an
international conference of doctors and health experts.
   Woods declined to say how much money the United States was
spending on developing the syringes, but he said they could be on
the market by the end of the year.
   Unlike other disposible syringes already in use, neither of the
two new types can be reused, Woods said.
   He said they are being tested by the Program for Appropriate
Technology in Health, a Seattle-based company, under contract to
the government. Woods did not provide details on the tests at the
conference on immunization and children's health.
   Woods said several other countries also are testing pre-filled,
single-use syringes, including France and Switzerland.
   ``When they are ready, we will have to flood the market with
these devices,'' said Dr. William Foege, director of the Task Force
for Child Survival, the conference sponsor.
   ``We will have to find some way of subsidizing the cost to get
them to developing countries because they'll be too expensive at
first. And we'll have to find some way to get the old syringes off
the market,'' said Foege, former director of the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga.
   Contaminated needles are responsible for the spread of a number
of diseases in developing countries and are a particular threat to
young children receiving vaccine injections.
   Needles contaminated with the HIV virus are believed to be a
major method of transmitting AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, the fatal disease that attacks the body's immune system
leaving it vulnerable to cancers and other diseases.
   AIDS can be transmitted by sex, intravenous drug use, blood
transfusion and from infected pregnant mothers to fetuses.

   Three-quarters of those carrying the AIDS
virus will develop either the fatal disease or an AIDS-related
condition within six years of infection, University of California
scientists reported Friday.
   Researchers from UC-San Francisco said their three-year study
made important advances in tracking the progression of the virus
but found little to encourage hope for long-term survival among
those infected with it.
   ``What we saw was that the number of those showing no effects
from HIV (AIDS virus) infection is very small,'' said Andrew Moss,
UCSF associate professor of epidemiology and international
health.``This means that if you are infected with the AIDS virus,
you will almost certainly go on to get AIDS.''
   The findings were published in Saturday's British Medical
Journal.
   The study was the first to base the prediction of progression to
AIDS or AIDS-related complex, called ARC, on microscopic changes in
patients' blood, the researchers said.
   The author of an earlier study on the topic said the new report
apparently provides important information for infected people
trying to decide whether to take immediate risks with anti-viral
drugs or wait for advances in treatment.
   ``The big question still is, `Will everybody at some point
progress (from the virus to AIDS) ... or is there a chance that
some people will be able to ride it out for 15 years?''' said Paul
O'Malley, director of the city Public Health Department's AIDS
research project.
   ``As each year progresses we know more, but we still can't fully
answer it,'' said O'Malley.
   O'Malley's study, released in February 1987, found that of 104
men infected with the AIDS virus, 15 percent developed AIDS within
five years, 22 percent developed the disease within six years and
33 percent had it within seven years. In addition, many of the
patients who did not have full-blown AIDS after six years suffered
from ARC.
   The national Centers for Disease Control has estimated that 20
percent to 30 percent of the 1 million to 1.5 million Americans
infected with the AIDS virus will develop the disease by the end of
1991.
   The CDC reported this week that 55,167 cases of AIDS in the
United States have been reported since June 1981; 30,932 of those
people have died.
   Researchers at UCSF followed 288 men with the virus for three
years and used five ``markers'' in the blood to estimate how many
would contract AIDS or ARC after another three years. The markers
included measurements of proteins and cells.
   Twenty-two percent of study participants developed AIDS during
the three-year period and 19 percent developed ARC, a milder form
of the disease that can develop into AIDS.
   An additional 24 percent had laboratory abnormalities that the
researchers found to be highly predictive of AIDS or ARC.
   Extrapolating from the evidence, the scientists said an
additional 10 percent would develop AIDS or ARC within six years,
for a total of 75 percent.
   Even the men who had not developed AIDS or ARC after three years
showed clear signs of progression toward a worsened condition in
their blood markers, the study found.
   The researchers described their six-year estimates as
conservative, saying the actual rate of progression may be much
higher.
   ``HIV infection is much more serious than we thought in the
early days,'' Moss said. ``It may take eight or nine years, but
eventually the infected person will probably get AIDS.''

<TEXT>
   A man who escaped from a Michigan prison in 1984
and started a secret new life in Ontario pleaded guilty Friday to
58 armed robberies across Canada.
   Los Angeles-born Gilbert Galvan, 30, was accused of obtaining
cash and jewelry worth more than $1.8 million (U.S.) in the
robberies.
   He was sentenced to 20 years in prison by an Ontario Provincial
Court judge in Pembroke.
   Galvan robbed banks in 14 Canadian cities from Halifax to
Vancouver, police said. The Peterborough Examiner said Galvan
became known as the ``flying bandit'' because he traveled to
holdups on Air Canada, the national airline.
   He robbed one bank in Peterborough on three separate occasions
and once looted two banks in Regina, Saskatchewan, in less than an
hour, according to police.
   They said he carried a loaded gun but never committed physical
violence.
   Police said Galvan fled prison in St. Joseph County, Mich., on
May 18, 1984, with eight years still to serve for embezzlement.
   He entered Canada using the alias of Robert Lee Whiteman and
later was married, according to statements to the court.
   Police said Galvan's wife believed he was a computer salesman
and was shocked _ and pregnant _ when they arrested him in Pembroke
last June in connection with a holdup in London, Ontario.
   He was sentenced to 11 years for that robbery, and police then
put together a case linking him with 58 additional bank and jewelry
store robberies.
   His 20-year sentence will be served concurrently with the
11-year term.
   Some loot was recovered, but police said Galvan may have stashed
money in banks in Europe or the Caribbean, where he often
vacationed with his wife.
   Police said Galvan always had a gun, always wore a disguise, and
usually passed a note to a teller.
   When he was arrested, police said Galvan told officers he was
only going to ``do a few more and then quit.''

   The U.N. Human Rights Commission
ended its annual session Friday after accepting an invitation from
Cuban President Fidel Castro to visit Cuba to determine if abuses
were taking place.
   U.N. spokesman Jean-Paul Riviere said that 78 resolutions on
human rights situations throughout the world were adopted during
the six-week session. Last year, the 43-nation panel adopted 61
measures.
   The resolutions denounced a wide range of violations, with
emphasis on the situations in the Israeli-occupied territories,
southern Africa, Chile, Iran and Afghanistan. The mandates of
special U.N. investigators were extended.
   The commission also took about 20 other decisions, including one
late Thursday accepting the Castro government's invitation to send
a delegation for an inquiry into allegations of rights abuses.
   That decision, drafted by four Latin American countries, was
approved without vote. It was the first time Cuba agreed to admit
foreign investigators. The delegation will visit Cuba this summer
and report its findings to the 1989 session of the commission.
   The United States subsequently withdrew a draft resolution
calling for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
examine the rights situation in Cuba and report to the commission.
   U.S. chief delegate Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political
prisoner, said the plan ``goes far beyond what we had originally
asked. It is very important.''

   An apparent stowaway was found dead Friday in the

hopes of getting into the country, authorities said.
   Four of the stowaways were caught Thursday, and three more came
out of hiding and were caught trying to run away Friday when a
workman unloading Colombian bananas from the freighter discovered
the body, authorities said.
   A carton of bananas, apparently fallen from a stack, lay across
the body.
   James Wright, a spokesman for the Metro-Dade police, would not
speculate on the cause of death and said an autopsy scheduled for
Saturday.
   Joe Livingston, who found the body, said it appeared the man had
been hiding in a small floor space cleared by moving cartons aside.
   The seven stowaways were in Immigration and Naturalization
Service custody. George Waldroup, an INS spokesman, said seven are
believed to be Colombian. The nationality of the dead man was not
immediately known.

<HEAD>Another Brain-Absent Baby Kept Alive As Potential Organ Donor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loma Linda Medical Center said Friday
has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and
will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be
used for transplant.
   The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified
Southern California hospital Thursday and transferred to Loma Linda
University Medical Center, said Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for
the center.
   Baby D suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is
missing. The condition almost always leads to death within days or
weeks. ``His parents want to donate their baby's organs when brain
death occurs,'' Rockwell said.
   Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology, said Baby D
was resting comfortably Friday and receiving nutrition and water as
needed. Rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a seven-day
period that began Thursday night.
   Under Loma Linda policy, Baby D will be placed on life support
if needed to prevent damage to organs.
   If Baby D is declared brain-dead within seven days, the hospital
will give notice that his organs are available for transplant. If
he isn't brain dead within seven days, he will be allowed to die.
   The time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that
doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their
organs can be donated.
   Rockwell said anonymity was requested by Baby D's parents and
officials of the hospital where he was born.
   Baby D is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible
organ donor at the hospital.
   The first was stillborn Dec. 23, thwarting her parents' desire
to have her major organs donated. Her corneas and heart valves were
given to infants needing them.
   The second anencephalic was declared brain-dead Feb. 18.
Attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients
either weren't suitable matches or couldn't be operated on in time.
He was disconnected from life-support Feb. 20.
   Most recently, a girl was transferred to Loma Linda after birth
Feb. 20. Because she never met brain-death criteria within the
seven-day limit, she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed
to die on Feb. 28. However, her eyes, corneas and heart valves were
later donated to infants needing organs.
   Loma Linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when Dr. Leonard
Bailey, frustrated at the lack of heart donors for babies,
transplanted a baboon's heart into a girl known as Baby Fae. She
died 20{ days later.
   Bailey, whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many
doctors, subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of
hearts and other organs.

   Guests in three floors of London's Grosvenor House
hotel were evacuated Friday night when fire broke out in an air
conditioning unit, the management reported.
   Hotel manager Francis Green said the unit was in the top floor
of the 10-story hotel and the guests in the three floors below were
evacuated.
   ``There was no panic and no one was injured,'' Green said.
   The evacuated guests went to the hotel restaurant and bar on a
lower floor until the fire was extinguished an hour after it
started, he said.
   Green said there was minimal damage to the rooms.

<TEXT>
   Andreas Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent
newspaper, appeared at a hearing in the Old Bailey Central Criminal
Court on Friday over alleged possession of a secret document on the
fight against terrorism.
   The hearing before Judge Aron Owen was closed but Whittam Smith
told reporters his newspaper was accused of having a document
obtained in violation of the Official Secrets Act.
   ``We shall argue against that most strongly,'' he said after the
case was adjourned to next week.
   A story in his paper Thursday described proposals in a ``draft
confidential report'' on how information would be built up by the
12 European governments in a data base to keep track of extremists
across frontiers.
   It said the British were unenthusiastic about the idea because
of reluctance to endanger informants and surveillance methods.
   The interior ministers of the 12 governments involved are known
as the Trevi group, after the Italian town where their first
meeting was held in 1976.
   The story did not say how the document was obtained. A police
order served on The Independent to surrender the document said it
concerned a meeting of the Trevi group in Brussels last January.
   Press and public were excluded from the Old Bailey hearing at
the request of government law officers.
   Whittam Smith said his daily's attorney, Desmond Brown, had
argued that the 1911 Official Secrets Act could not apply to a
document obtained outside Britain and one that was held by all 12
members in the Trevi agreement.
   Under the act, unauthorized release of government information is
illegal.
   The Independent story by its domestic affairs correspondent,
Sarah Helm, said the killing of three Irish Republican Army members
by British security agents in Gibraltar last Monday ``is seen as
firm proof that intercountry cooperation promoted by Trevi is
working.''

<HEAD>Protestant Paramilitary Leader Quits after Attempt on Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Northern
Ireland's largest Protestant paramilitary group resigned Friday,
four days after a foiled attempt on his life.
   The Ulster Defense Association announced that it was ``mutually
agreed'' that Andy Tyrie, 48, would step down as chairman, a post
he has held since 1973. No successor was immediately named.
   On Monday, a clandestine Protestant group calling itself the
Loyalist People's Reaction Force claimed responsiblity for planting
the bomb that Tyrie found attached to his car.
   Tyrie, considered a moderate in the British province's sectarian
feuding, advocates independence for Northern Ireland under a
power-sharing Protestant-Roman Catholic administration.
   The Ulster Defense Association, with an estimated 10,000
members, was established in 1971 as an umbrella group for
Protestant vigilante groups. It defines its main aim as preventing
the unification of predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and
the Catholic-dominated Irish Republic to the south.
   Although the organization is widely assumed to be armed, the
British government has resisted calls by the Catholic minority to
outlaw it.
   Tyrie became prominent in 1974 when he led hooded paramilitaries
in support of worker strikes that destroyed a joint
Catholic-Protestant administration set up by the British government.
   But later he came to embrace power-sharing as a way to end the
province's two decades of conflict between Protestants and
Catholics.
   Tyrie was credited with unifying and imposing discipline on the
Ulster Defense Association and with ending random killings of
Catholics attributed to the organization.
   But he lost some influence because of his reluctance to throw
the group's weight behind large street protests against the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement. That pact gives the Irish Republic a
consultative role in running Northern Ireland.
   His organization also was wracked by allegations that it was
involved in extortion and racketeering, sometimes in league with
its archenemy, the Irish Republican Army. Dissidents accused Tyrie
of failing to clamp down on the alleged abuses.
   Under Tyrie, the Ulster Defense Association produced a blueprint
for power-sharing that was hailed as a farsighted attempt to break
the deadlock between Catholics and Protestants. John McMichael, the
group member largely responsible for the blueprint, was
assassinated by the IRA last December.

   Salah Salah, a leader of one of the
factions in the Palestine Liberation Organization, was detained by
Syrian troops stationed along the Lebanese-Syrian border, police
sources said Friday.
   The sources, speaking with the condition they not be identified,
said Salah was seized Monday as his chauffeur-driven car arrived at
the Masnaa border post.
   They said Salah's Palestinian driver was released but Salah was
taken away and they had no information about his whereabouts.
   Salah, 48, is a Politburo member of George Habash's Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine _ PFLP. Neither PFLP
nor PLO officials would comment on the police report.
   Salah had played an active role in gaining the release March 1
of two United Nations relief officials, a Swede and a Norwegian,
who had been kidnapped and held captive by Moslem militants for 25
days.
   The police sources said they did not know if Salah's detention
was linked to his mediation to free the Scandinavians.
   They said Salah was en route to the PFLP headquarters in
Damascus, the Syrian capital, when he was seized by the soldiers.
   Syria has 25,000 military personnel in northern and eastern
Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate issued by the Arab League
because of the civil war between Lebanese Moslem and Christian
militias.
   Damascus has supported rebels opposed to PLO chief Yasser Arafat
since 1983. The PFLP has maintained good relations with the Syrian
government even after a reconciliation last year with Arafat.

   Argentina asked Friday for a U.N. Security
Council meeting on British military maneuvers under way near the
disputed Falkland Islands, a spokesman for the Argentine mission to
the United Nations said.
   Ambassador Marcelo E.R. Delpech made the request at a meeting

   The Falklands are a British colony, but Argentina maintains its
claim to the islands 500 miles off the Argentine coast based on
settlers dating from the early 1880s.
   In 1982, Argentine forces invaded and captured the islands, but
they were defeated by a British task force in a 74-day war.
   Argentina has denounced the British military exercises as a
provocation and put its armed forces on alert.
   The Organization of American States expressed concern and called
on both countries to resume negotiations over the the islands,
known in Argentina as the Malvinas.
   Ricardo Ernesto Lagorio, a spokesman for Argentina's U.N.
mission, said the Security Council was expected to hold
consultations next week to decide how to approach the issue.

^The Government Is Changing the Numbers It Collects</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of mid-sized cities in the West will
no longer get detailed figures on monthly price changes in their
communities.
   In New York and Los Angeles, monthly household surveys of
employment and unemployment are being cut back sharply. Tracking of
trends among blacks, Hispanics, teen-agers and women in the two
cities will be less current.
   The government is changing the numbers it collects and crunches
to measure whether times are good or bad.
   As a result, a congressional mandate to find out what happens to
laid off workers in all 50 states when their local factories close
is being scaled back to cover just 32 states.
   Wage surveys in some of the fastest growing occupations _
architects, engineers and health technicians _ have been abandoned.
Postponed indefinitely are efforts to learn more about the growing
numbers of people who hold down two or more jobs.
   In their place, the government is going to provide more and
better trade figures _ beginning with monthly rather than quarterly
changes in the prices of imported and exported goods.
   The changes are being made by the Labor and Commerce Departments
partly in response to the globalization of the economy and changing
perceptions of what is important.
   With unemployment at a decade low 5.7 percent and inflation
running below 4.5 percent, the monthly jobless and consumer price
figures command less attention than when either or both were in
double digits.
   Just as big a factor _ if not bigger _ is the deficit-reducing
budget cuts negotiated by Congress and President Reagan last year.
Statistics gatherers were ordered to take the same across-the-board
spending cuts as the Pentagon.
   March and April will be the last months the Labor Department's
Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys consumer price changes in Salt
Lake City; Sacremento, Calif.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Columbus, Ohio;
Raeford, N.C., and five primarily rural counties in central
Kentucky.
   Beginning next month, the bureau will reduce the size of its
monthly employment surveys from 2,200 to 1,300 households in New
York City and from 2,100 to 825 households in Los Angeles for an
annual savings of $750,000.
   Detailed reports on changes among racial and other demographic
subgroups in the two cities will be issued every six months instead
of every three months.
   Another $427,000 in some $9.7 million that Congress cut from the
bureau's budget will be saved by delaying a special report on dual
job holders _ a growing phenomenon that could help explain how
Americans maintain their living standards despite hourly wage
increases that don't keep pace with inflation.
   Spared in the cuts are data collection and analyses that would
diminish the accuracy of the bureau's most widely used reports: the
monthly nationwide surveys of employment and unemployment and
consumer and wholesale prices.
   ``The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't produce any useless
products, but we have to prioritize them,'' says its deputy
commissioner, William J. Barron. ``Our budget was cut 4.6 percent
across the board and, to preserve the integrity of the national
figures, some of the regional, local and special programs became
vulnerable. We did the best we could.''
   Not everyone agrees.
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, foreseeing a rise in
unemployment, complained in a letter to Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin that collecting less data for his city amounts to
``turning off the lights in the operating room when the operation
is still in progress.''
   Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Ortner _ who oversees the
government's data on retail sales, trade, economic growth and
housing _ said complaints are inevitable whenever any data is
reduced or eliminated.
   ``New York City complains it's no longer getting special
treatment, but that's the nature of New York,'' Ortner said. ``They
think they are entitled to special treatment.''
   Also falling victim to the budget ax are BLS surveys in six
cities on wages in auto repair shops and hotels and motels. Future
reductions are planned in surveys of wages in hospitals, nursing
homes, banking and computer services.
   ``All of these things are important,'' said the bureau's Barron.
``But the over-all issue facing everybody is the budget deficit.
We're just adhering to what Congress ordered.''
   There is an exception. The Reagan administration is asking for
specific increases to improve the government's trade data _ a
monthly fixture that has become crucial in view of the record
$171.2 billion U.S. trade deficit last year.
   In his proposed fiscal 1989 budget, President Reagan asked for a
$3.2 million increase in the bureau's current budget resources of
$5.4 million for collecting international price comparisons.
   ``That program was started in the early 1970s and no one foresaw
the tremendous incease in trade,'' Barron said. ``From 1976 to
1986, the value of imports has increased 286 percent. Our samples
are not representative of what's taking place.''
   The administration has contended that the dollar's devaluation
against foreign currencies has masked an improving trade picture in
terms of volumes of goods and services exported and imported. But
the numbers to back up that claim have been sketchy estimates.
   With monthly rather than quarterly trade changes measured,
Ortner says the Commerce Department will soon be able to get a
better handle on how much is moving across borders.
   ``The problem with the data seemed to grow with the trade
imbalance,'' he said. ``Given the important policy decisions to be
made, it's important to have meaningful as well as accurate data.''
   Ortner believes there always will be a clamor for improving one
economic statistic or another, depending on whether it is
inflation, unemployment, recession or a trade deficit that is
dominating newspaper headlines.
   ``Interest in the accuracy of the numbers just like the economy
moves in cycles,'' he said. ``At the moment, it's the trade figures
that have the limelight. As they tend to improve, the
disproportionate interest in them will fade and something else will
take their place.''

<TEXT>
   Even with all its sectarian strife and
economic chaos, Lebanon is preparing for a presidential election in
July and the signs now point to more disruption and division.
   By tradition, the presidency has been set aside for Lebanon's
Christians while the posts of prime minister and Parliament speaker
have gone to Moslems. This year, however, some leading Moslems have
begun laying claim to the presidency as well.
   An array of Christian politicians, ambassadors, exiles, former
security and intelligence chiefs, the army commander and militia
chieftains are possible candidates to succeed President Amin
Gemayel, a 45-year-old Maronite Catholic, when his six-year term
expires Sept. 22.
   No Moslems have yet to step forward as candidates, but some
influential Moslem factions are making it plain they believe the
presidential post should be theirs.
   With Lebanon dismembered by the 13-year-old civil war, Gemayel
has become politically powerless; his authority is confined to a
shrunken Christian enclave. He is constitutionally barred from
running for a second term.
   Finding a successor acceptable to all sides promises to be a
monumental task. To a large extent, that includes being acceptable
to Syria and Israel, the two key outside players in Lebanon.
   Gemayel torpedoed a Syrian-arranged peace treaty between rival
Moslem and Christian militia leaders in December 1985 and Syria now
is expected to want someone more to its liking. Syria, which has
troops in Lebanon, is heavily influential among Sunni and Shiite
Moslems.
   But hardline Christians, such as Samir Geagea, leader of the
Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, are not expected to
go along with anyone Syria wants.
   A Lebanese Forces spokesman, Georges Abdel Massih, told The
Associated Press the militia ``will block the election of a
president imposed by Syria ... with political pressure and even
military pressure.''
   ``We want a president who can liberate Lebanon, then unite it,''
Geagea has said. ``We're tired of intervention that has no limits
and we will not let foreigners play a role in presidential
elections.''
   Gemayel was hastily elected president after his younger brother,
Bashir, was killed in a September 1982 bombing nine days before he
was due to be sworn in as president.
   Under an unwritten convention dating from Lebanon's independence
from France in 1943, the president is traditionally a Maronite
Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   When that pact was made, the Christians were deemed to be the
majority sect by a pre-independence census. But now the 1.2 million
Shiites are the biggest single group. Christians, whose ranks have
been depleted by those who have fled the country, now number about
900,000.
   With Syria's backing, the Shiites are now demanding political
equality, and some even want one of their own as president.
   Christians like Geagea refuse to surrender the presidency,
however.
   Pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalists are even another matter,
since they seek to establish an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Lebanon.
   So far, only one candidate has announced officially for the
presidential race. He is Dany Chamoun, a former Christian militia
leader, leader of the National Liberal Party and son of the late
Camille Chamoun, a former president.
   Chamoun has said he opposes partition of Lebanon and favors a
secular state, free of all foreign forces, like the 25,000 Syrian
troops in north and east Lebanon and Moslem west Beirut, and the
Israelis who remain in a southern border strip.
   Iran has about 3,000 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
Revolutionary Guards in east Lebanon and thousands of Palestinian
fighters are in Lebanese refugee camps.
   Unannounced but likely Christian candidates are Raimond Edde, a
veteran politician in self-exile in France since 1976 following two
assassination attempts, and Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite who was
president when the civil war erupted.
   Still other possible Christian candidates are Lebanon's
ambassador to France, Farouk Abi Lamaa, a former security chief;
and the envoy to Switzerland, Johnny Abdo, a former military
intelligence chief.
   Other Christians mentioned are Gen. Michel Aoun, the army
commander who once was a Gemayel loyalist; the millionaire
businessmen Manuel Younes, and Henri Sfeir.
   Elie Hobeika, the ousted pro-Syrian leader of the Lebanese
Forces, and former Gemayel aide Jean Obeid, who was kidnapped in
Beirut for several days last year, are considered outside
possibilities. Both also are Christians.
   On the Moslem side, the maneuvering is much less in the open.
   Nonetheless, Justice Minister Nabih Berri, leader of the
Syrian-backed Shiite Amal militia, has declared Lebanon should have
a Shiite president, although he has not put himself forward.
   Leaflets distributed in west Beirut call for the installation of
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, to head an Islamic
republic.

   The new neighbors are quiet. They generally
keep to themselves, eat out a lot, and commune with nature.
   The new neighbors also have hooves.
   Squeezed out of their traditional woodland habitat by
encroaching development, deer are adapting to kids on skateboards,
barking dogs, slamming car doors _ in short, the suburbs.
   ``They seem to be quite comfortable and taking life in stride,''
said Thomas Litwon, director of field research at the 200-acre
Seatuck National Wildlife Refuge in Islip, on Long Island's South
Shore.
   Litwon directed a three-year Cornell University study of
whitetail deer living in a neighborhood adjacent to the refuge.
About 20 deer live between the houses, not far from a busy
intersection and a McDonald's.
   The bucks, some with antler racks, weigh as much as 200 pounds;
the does weigh up to 100 pounds.
   ``It is really amazing but they seem to be very healthy,'' said
Litwon. The Cornell researchers found that the deer ``were clearly
meeting their needs _ food, water and cover.''
   Nor is this a phenomenon limited to the suburbs of New York
City. Deer have also moved into suburban neighborhoods in large
numbers in Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin and Colorado, according to
wildlife authorities.
   ``Long Island is just a microcosm of what is happening all over
the country,'' said Litwon. ``The landscape of our planet is
changing into an urban world and this is one example of what is
happening because of it.''
   James Witham of the Illinois Natural History Survey said there
has been a substantial increase of deer in Chicago's suburbs. He
recalled that last year, a deer was hit by a car when it crossed a
busy street in Addison, Ill.
   Stunned, the deer wandered over to a grocery store. It stood on
the rubber mat at the entry way, opened the automatic door, and
commenced to graze on the lettuce and radishes in the produce
section.
   ``He evidently thought he found a new place to feed,'' Witham
said.
   Authorities say the buck that crashed through the window of
Captain's Pizza in Bridgeport, Conn., last summer was not foraging
for Italian food.
   Jim Spignesi, biologist with the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection, theorizes the deer's usual habitat was a
90-acre park about five miles away, but development in the area
forced the beast onto Main Street.
   Spignesi said the deer believed it was hurdling a three-foot
stone wall, and did not see the glass. He set off a burglar alarm;
officers found the deer cowering in the dining room, according to
owner Gregory Kapeteneas. It was treated for minor cuts, and
released in woods 25 miles away.
   Most encounters with the deer are less spectacular. Mary Moore
of Islip says the deer will eat corn out of a plastic cup held by
her husband.
   ``They come right to our back door. Especially the babies, the
ones with the white spots,'' she says. ``They don't bother anyone.''
   Others are less appreciative. ``They've eaten my bushes right
down to the stem,'' said one resident who asked that her name not
be used.
   She used to think the deer were adorable. No more.
   ``It cost me thousands of dollars to replace my azaleas and
rhododendrons. Now I have chicken wire around them,'' she said.
   Also of concern to residents is Lyme disease, a malady that is
carried by ticks found on deer and other animals. A bite by an
infected tick leaves a red, doughnut-shaped rash which, if
untreated, can lead to a high fever, paralysis and swelling of the
joints.
   State health officials say 450 cases of the disease were
reported on Long Island last year, an increase of 50 from 1986.
   Edward Bosler, research scientist for the New York State Health
Department, said there has been an increase of ticks in the areas
where the deer live but he believes the deer are ``getting a bad
rap.''
   ``Shooting all the deer would not eliminate Lyme disease,'' said
Bosler. ``The tick would only look for another carrier.''
   But shooting some of the deer could help the Long Island herd,
says Harry Knock, state Department of Environmental Conservation
wildlife manager.
   Most of Long Island's herd of 3,000 deer inhabit the eastern end
of the island. Knock says deer began wandering off Long Island
refuges and parks in noticeable numbers about six years ago.
Over-population is to blame, he says.
   ``People have refused to have a deer hunting season on some of
the refuges because they are afraid they are killing Bambi,'' said
Knock.
   About 150 deer died from starvation last year despite a mild
winter, according to Knock. Others face death from disease or
accidents.
   Knock advocates a hunting season on lands where it is now
prohibited in order to bring the number of deer into balance with
the food available. He disagrees sharply with those who rebel at
Bambicide.
   ``These well-meaning people are doing a disservice to the deer
by looking at them as a personality.'' he said.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which overseas the
preserves, is exploring alternatives to reducing the deer herds.
   But Ray Whittemore, in charge of the eight U.S. wildlife
preserves on Long Island, said a hunt is unlikely. The public
opposes it, and most of the land was donated with the stipulation
that it remain ``forever wild'' and closed to hunters, he said.
   Witham, the Illinois expert, said there is no simple answer.
   ``Deer and man are just going to have to learn to live with each
other,'' he said. ``There has to be a balance and compromise.''

   Since he came to power three years ago, Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has imposed his image upon the world. His visits to
the West and meetings with President Reagan have brought him
intimately into tens of millions of U.S. living rooms. He has made
glasnost and perestroika part of a worldwide vocabulary. But what
has it meant to the ordinary Soviet citizen? Here is a scorecard of
his Kremlin stewardship.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Three years have been enough for Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to shake his nation, break away from economic dogmas a
half-century old and strike a new kind of arms deal with the United
States.
   Yet many of Gorbachev's 284 million compatriots have so far seen
few concrete results from his robust style of leadership.
   The reform-minded Communist Party chief, who turned 57 this
month, says he has just begun to reshape his country and
acknowledges the toughest years lie ahead.
   ``We have revived throughout the world hope for the future,''
Gorbachev said in a Feb. 18 speech. ``We ought to treasure that,
and to justify the trust that we feel everywhere.''
   Within a week of being named Soviet leader on March 11, 1985,
following the death of Konstantin U. Chernenko, Gorbachev called
for speeding up the country's economic and social development.
   There have been stirrings of change, as well as resistance, as
bureaucrats are laid off, workers face more demanding standards and
the specter of price hikes looms.
   Yet as Gorbachev enters his fourth year in power, the Soviet
Union still must import grain to feed itself. Poor housing, a
monotonous diet and hours spent waiting in line to buy low-quality
goods remain the lot of millions.
   Gorbachev has set himself an ambitious agenda, one he
increasingly says will take years to enact. Here, in Gorbachev's
words, are the goals he has fixed, and his successes and setbacks
to date.
   
   GLASNOST _ ``We must not evade the problems that have arisen ..
. so let us say it, loud and clear!'' (1986)
   Glasnost for Soviets has meant being able to read in their press
about prostitution, homelessness and other social ills whose
existence was once denied.
   In January, they were told for the first time of a domestic air
crash the same day it occurred.
   Glasnost has breathed life into theater, films and art. Boris
Pasternak's masterpiece ``Doctor Zhivago'' appeared in print this
year for the first time, and there is franker discussion of the
legacy of dictator Josef Stalin and some of his victims, including
Nikolai I. Bukharin, were posthumously rehabilitated.
   But, as Russians would say, ``blank spots'' in glasnost persist.
A reflex seems to make the Kremlin leadership hesitate before
issuing bad news, as during the Chernobyl disaster or the ethnic
bloodshed in Azerbaijan last month.
   Glasnost is not a Soviet-style First Amendment. Unsanctioned
public gatherings are prohibited. Independent groups are barred
from having printing presses. Newspapers toe the party line on
foreign policy and defense.
   
   LIVING STANDARDS _ ``Plans for the country's social and economic
development envisage raising the people's well-being to a
qualitatively new level.'' (1986)
   For the Soviet worker, it means people who work well are
entitled to earn more. Those who don't can be fired.
   Moreover, 16 million people are expected to be laid off by the
year 2000 because of rising labor efficiency and cuts made in the
government bureaucracy.
   Many Soviets worry the reforms may hurt their buying power.
Authorities are studying a price hike to slash the $97 billion
spent yearly to subsidize milk, bread and other staples.
   Meat and butter are still rationed in some areas, and well-made
shoes and clothing are rare. In winter, onions and potatoes are the
only vegetables in many Moscow food stores.
   One family in five lives in communal housing.
   The Soviet living standard is still markedly low when compared
to the developed West, and a criticism once made by Nikita S.
Khrushchev still seems apt: ``What sort of a communist society is
it that has no sausage?''
   
   PERESTROIKA _ ``The economy is a mess ... we have forgotten how
to work.'' (1987)
   Perestroika, the restructuring and modernization of the
state-run economy, is the linchpin of Gorbachev's program. It runs
counter to more than 50 years of central control, when bureaucrats
set production levels of everything from safety pins to trucks.
   Factory managers are now free to contract freely with other
firms. Citizens can drive taxis or organize in cooperatives to run
a restaurant.
   The bottom line, so far, has been inconclusive.
   Last year, for the first time in recent memory, the entire rise
in production was due to greater efficiency, rather than the
building of new factories. The gross national product rose by 3.3
percent.
   However, more than one enterprise in eight lost money. Many
factories signed contracts, then failed to deliver.
   Others delivered, but no one was interested in $2.3 billion
worth of goods too shoddy or outmoded to attract buyers.
   
   AGRICULTURE _ ``Comrades, a problem that we will have to solve
in the shortest time possible is that of fully supplying our
country with food.'' (1986)
   A peasant's son and the party's former chief for agriculture,
Gorbachev well knows the woes of the Soviet state-run farming
sector, and after eight months in power, he created a
``superministry'' to tackle them.
   But in 1987, partly because of bad weather, farm output was up
by only 1.8 percent over 1986, and harvests of some crops like
potatoes actually declined.
   Foreign farmers continue to feed a part of the Soviet
population. The 1987 grain crop was the third largest in history,
but a drop in the output of good wheat has forced the Soviets to
import large quantities of grain for bread.
   
   SUPERPOWER AND FOREIGN RELATIONS _ ``The Soviet Union is
proposing a step-by-step and consistent process of ridding the
earth of nuclear weapons ... before the end of this century.''
(1986)
   Relations with Washington had begun to warm slightly before
Gorbachev took over as Soviet leader. But his tenure has seen a
rebirth of optimism that reminds some of the detente days of the
1970s.
   Gorbachev and President Reagan are preparing a fourth summit. In
December, they signed a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear
missiles, the first superpower pact outlawing a class of weaponry.
Negotiators are working on a treaty that would halve superpower
strategic arsenals.
   Gorbachev has proclaimed his readiness to pull out of
Afghanistan, ending an eight-year Soviet military occupation that
has damaged Kremlin prestige, cost billions of rubles and claimed
the lives of an estimated 10,000 Soviet soldiers.
   He has given East bloc nations more latitude to set their own
domestic courses, and courted Asian countries and America's allies
in Europe. But irritants like concerns over Soviet human rights
violations remain.
   In February, he told a visitor: ``Western Europe is not ready so
far to understand us the way we really are. People there continue
to be afraid of the Soviet Union. This is deep-rooted.''

   One of Sweden's largest lumber

Sweden's forestry business this week.
   MoDo's offer for Holmens Bruk AB and Iggesunds AB came two days

$1 billion for Swedish Match AB.
   Bernt Lof, MoDo's chief executive, said the offer consisted of

<HEAD>For Presidential Candidates, No Gain in Pain This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the economy still growing and the trade
deficit shrinking, presidential candidates who hoped to capitalize
on economic pain are getting no mileage from pocketbook issues.
   Recent upbeat economic statistics are making it hard for
Democrats to use the economy to their advantage as a campaign issue.
   And Super Tuesday voting appears to have eliminated from the
race more than just a few candidates. It also may have buried
trade, or at least protectionism, as a vote-getting theme.
   The candidate who sought to capitalize on the issue the most,
Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., was a big loser in Tuesday's
contests. He captured only his home state of Missouri.
   Gephardt didn't win a single state in the South, where his
advocacy of a ``get-tough'' trade policy to protect import-battered
U.S. industries had been expected to play well.
   An amendment that bears his name, centerpiece of a House-passed
trade bill, is expected to be stripped from compromise trade
legislation now before a House-Senate conference committee.
   The measure calls for mandatory reduction of trade surpluses
maintained by countries who restrict their own markets to U.S.
goods. The measure has been widely viewed as slap against Japan,
Taiwan and other Asian allies.
   Gephardt was not the only candidate who failed to get any
political mileage from the trade issue. Sen. Bob Dole found his
support for a textile-quota bill of little help in Republican
caucuses in South Carolina, a key textile-producing state.
   ``When we have basic prosperity and basic optimism in the
country, that 800-pound gorilla _ the economic issue _ doesn't sit
down,'' said Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative research organization.
   Rep. Jack Kemp's supply-side economic theories most closely
matched President Reagan's, but the connection did not benefit him
as he received only a fraction of the vote and was forced to
withdraw.
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush, who once derided
supply-side policies as ``voodoo economics,'' is now enjoying
enormous GOP support, partly due to his identification with Reagan.
``Bush is trying to surgically attach himself to Ronald Reagan,''
Ornstein suggested.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the Wefa Group, a private
economic forecasting service, said as long as the economy is fairly
healthy, matters of personality and organization will have more
impact on votes than economic philosophies.
   ``To the extent the economy stays where it is right now,
obviously it will be difficult to use it as an issue,'' except in a
positive sense, Chimerine said.
   Gephardt has always disputed that his views are protectionist,
even though critics suggest his amendment defines the term. In any
event, support for the Gephardt measure has eroded since it was
narrowly approved a year ago on a 218-214 House vote.
   Congressional leaders kept the legislation alive this long, both
as a courtesy to Gephardt and out of curiosity over how it and he
would fare at the polls.
   Much has happened on the trade and economic fronts in the past
few months, changing the political landscape.
   Just last fall, the trade deficit hit a one-month record of
$17.6 billion in October, the stock market collapse sent tremors
through the economy, the dollar plunged in foreign-exchange markets
and a recession seemed imminent.
   Since then, the trade shortfall has shown two dramatic months of
export-led improvement, manufaucturing industries are enjoying a
resurgence and the dollar has stabilized.
   Interest rates and inflation remain restrained and the civilian
unemployment rate fell in Feburary to 5.7 percent, its lowest rate
since May 1979.
   ``On the political side, everything is coming up roses. This is
another lucky Reagan year,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for
the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc. ``Who could ask for
anything more than continuing growth, reasonably low inflation and
a reviving manufacturing sector?''
   Exit polls taken by ABC-TV on Super Tuesday showed 18 percent of
those surveyed considered a candidate's stand on trade as ``very
important'' in making up their minds _ but only 14 percent of them
said they voted for Gephardt.
   ``The primaries have brought trade to the forefront of public
discussion. But the trade issue is not the exclusive domain of any
one candidate, nor was Super Tuesday a referendum on the issue,''
said Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO. The labor
federation has been one of the most outspoken backers of the
Gephardt amendment.
   Gephardt himself said afterward that he still believed ``a huge
majority of people agree with my trade position.''
   ``But they didn't know it was my policy. It was just our
inability to be able to get that message out there,'' he said.

   Fishermen in New Bedford hauled in
$143.7 million worth of scallops and fish last year, which
virtually locks the city's title as the most lucrative U.S. fishing
port, officials said Friday.
   The catch of 76.3 million pounds is expected to be the most
valuable in the nation for the fifth straight year, said Jay Tebeau
of the National Marine Fisheries Service. The value of the 1987
catch was a 26 percent increase over 1986.
   The service annually ranks about 60 U.S. ports according to
dollar value and pounds of seafood. Figures for other ports will
not be available for weeks, but Tebeau said, ``It's a sure bet that
New Bedford will come in tops as far as value is concerned.''

<HEAD>1988 Shaping Up To Be A Better Year For `Munis'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It probably won't go down as the year of the
``muni,'' but experts say 1988 also isn't expected to mirror last
year's disastrous performance for the municipal bond market.
   The volume of issues from state and local governments totaled
$14.4 billion during the first two months of this year, down from
$16.5 billion a year ago, but still one of the best starts on
record, according to Securities Data Co.-Bond Buyer, which tracks
the municipal market.
   Although 1987 started out on a positive note, rising interest
rates put a damper on activity later in the year, sharply
curtailing volume and bringing about a severe decline in the value
of many municipal bond funds.
   Analysts say a drop in interest rates after the stock market
crash in October helped lure some borrowers back to the muni market.
   Neal Attermann, municipal research director of Kidder Peabody,
called the early data on the muni market was both ``helpful and
misleading.''
   ``It's a helpful indicator in that ... bonds are coming to
market despite restrictions'' resulting from the 1986 tax bill, he
said. Tax reform generally reduced the attractiveness of municipal
bond returns and also restricted use of the bonds.
   But he cautioned that ``1988 won't be a large year of issuance.''
   George Friedlander, a municipal bond analyst for Smith Barney,
Upham & Co., agreed. ``The data (for January and February) isn't so
great. On an annualized basis it comes out to $92 bilion a year.
That's a moderate supply.''
   Still, Atterman noted an early drop in the percentage of
refundings, or bond issues sold in order to retire older securities
usually to take advantage of lower rates.
   ``That's a very encouraging sign. That means that rather than
being tied to interest rates we have a lot of volume independent of
interest rates,'' he said.
   While market experts aren't predicting a banner year for the
municipal market, most aren't forecasting a replay of 1987 even
though the outlook for interest rates remains cloudy.
   Atterman notes that many changes could occur in the municipal
market following the presidential election, especially as demand
for a reduction in the budget deficit persists.
   ``That could result in a further restriction in tax-exempt
bonds,'' he said, adding that bond prices could rise on that
anticipation.
   So far this year, most of the munis sold were general purpose,
followed by education, utilities, health, transportation, water,
sewer and gas, housing, airports, student loans and solid waste
recovery, according to Securities Data.
   The largest issue in January, it said, came from the Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia, which sold $488.7 million of special
obligation refunding bonds. In February, the largest was $450
million of New York City general obligation bonds; and in March,
$404.75 million of power system revenue refunding bonds, Securities
data said.
   An overwhelming number of the bonds were tax exempt, it said.

<TEXT>
   A clash of titans looms on Wall Street in the
next few days when the Trade Deficit meets head-on with the Triple
Witching Hour.
   Though both of these ogres have been bedeviling Wall Street for
some time, they have rarely put in simultaneous appearances.
   But all that will change on Thursday, when the Commerce
Department issues its report on the nation's trade balance for
January just as the markets head into the final stages of trading
in a group of stock-index futures and options that are approaching
expiration.
   The combination looks highly explosive. The effect, however, may
be not to create a fireworks display, but rather a period of
extreme caution and safety-consciousness.
   ``Whenever something like this causes expectations to get high
and heartbeats to get rapid, it often turns out to be a
non-event,'' said Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y.
   ``Small investors, and a lot of large investors too, are likely
to sit it out.''
   The triple witching hour, which occurs on the third Friday of
March, June, September and December, apparently was tamed to some
extent last year when procedures were adopted to spread it out.
   Some futures contracts on stock-market indexes, which are used
by professional traders in computer strategies known as index
arbitrage, are now settled as of the opening on Friday, while
others are settled at the close that day.
   This time around, program traders will be operating under a
further restraint _ the so-called ``collar'' adopted by the New
York Stock Exchange on Feb. 4.
   This procedure closes off the exchange's main computerized
trading facilities to index arbitrage any time the Dow Jones
industrial average rises or falls 50 points from the previous day's
close.
   That poses a threat of problems to any program trader who might
need to close out a position just before expiration.
   For all the controversy surrounding them, index-arbitrage
transactions are designed as low-risk propositions. If one were to
go awry, it could quite conceivably cause a brokerage firm to lose
valued clients and traders themselves to lose their jobs.
   So the people who play this game are presumed to be proceeding
very carefully as this triple witching hour approaches.
   Market participants of all persuasions seemed to be playing it
cautious in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
hit a new early-1988 high on Tuesday but then backed off, closing
Friday at 2,034.98, down 22.88 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell .98 to 149.45,
while the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.35 to
296.09 and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market gained 2.12 to 375.48.
   Big Board volume averaged 199.77 million shares a day, against
208.08 million the week before.
   Since the collar was set up, it has never gone into effect,
although the Dow has risen or fallen about 48 points on three
separate occasions.
   Thus, it appears that it has become a de facto boundary, an
informal equivalent to the limits on daily price swings used in the
commodities markets.
   Wall Street analysts say it would be going too far to assume
that there can't be days in the future when the Dow goes past the
50-point limit. The collar's potential impact in such circumstances
is the subject of much conjecture.
   Whatever the collar's merits and potential perils, many
observers say it would be helpful for the market if it serves to
reduce the perceived volatility of stock prices in the investing
public's minds.
   As Johnson observed, ``Retail (individual) investors have been
deeply alienated by volatility in the market.''

   A government report showing lower inflation has soothed anxiety
in the bond market and helped ease interest rates, but some
economists say other figures suggesting weak retail sales raise the
possibility of a recession.
   The Labor Department said Friday its index that measures
wholesale prices fell 0.2 percent in February, reflecting a decline
in food and energy costs. This partly erased a 0.4 percent rise in
January and provided evidence that inflation remains under control.
   For the first two months of 1988, wholesale prices have been
increasing at an annual rate of 1.1 percent _ half of last year's
2.2 percent rise.
   The news cheered the bond market, which is highly sensitive to
evidence of inflation because rising prices erode the value of
fixed-income investments.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose about $6.50 per $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is a
signal of interest rate trends, fell to 8.50 percent from 8.55
percent late Thursday.
   Stocks also benefited. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials, which took its sharpest drop in nearly two months
Thursday with a 48.24 point loss, closed Friday with a gain of 8.95
at 2,034.98.
   Broader market indices also rose, and the Wilshire 5,000
Equities Index measuring the value of all U.S. stocks rose by
nearly $6 billion.
   A separate report by the Commerce Department showed retail sales
rose 0.6 percent in February, largely because of strong demand for
autos, but economists were more concerned with a sharp downward
revision in January sales.
   Instead of a 0.5 percent rise in January sales reported earlier,
the government said sales fell 0.2 percent, evidence that consumer
buying is much weaker than previously believed.
   This change was considered significant because consumer buying
is a crucial element in economic growth, and a significant slowdown
could slide the country into recession.
   Many economists fear that consumers have been reluctant to spend
money since the October stock market collapse and have been saving
instead.

   Oil prices closed out the week on the upswing,
but analysts are not sure how substantial the rally really is.
   After two days of slight gains, oil prices jumped strongly
higher Thursday, as traders anticipated production-cutting moves by
world producers. The advance continued Friday but was hampered by
continuous profit-taking, analysts said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
closed 29 cents higher at $16.29 per 42-gallon barrel. On Thursday,
the contract leaped 51 cents _ topping combined gains Tuesday and
Wednesday of 12 cents.
   Refined products also built on Thursday's strong advance.
Wholesale heating oil settled at 44.69 cents a gallon, up 0.76 cent
after Thursday's 0.90 cent gain. Wholesale unleaded gasoline closed
at 45.59 cents a gallon, up 0.45 cent after leaping 1.14 cents the
day before.
   Bob Baker, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
Friday's move reflected ``a growing confidence that, by whatever
means it might take, our oil-exporting friends will contain the
discounting and get prices moving up.''
   At the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. securities firm, however,
analyst Jayne Ball was less certain.
   ``At this point, it's unclear whether this is just a technical
correction ... or whether it's a serious recovery,'' she said.
   Analysts generally attributed Thursday's advance to market
sentiment that worried OPEC and non-member countries were
attempting to find ways to boost oil prices that had severely
eroded since late last year.
   By early this week, sluggish demand and growing surpluses,
together with discounting by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, had driven prices to levels between
$13 and $14 a barrel in the Persian Gulf _ far short of OPEC's $18
target _ and to $15.37 per barrel on the New York Merc, $2 to $3
cheaper than January levels.
   No hard news moved Friday's market. But Baker said traders were
turning bullish, ``looking for behind-the-scenes action we don't
know about'' on the part of the producers.
   Ms. Ball, however, was less enthusiastic.
   Noting that crude prices continued to gain ground in Friday's
session, she said product prices did not ``put in all that good a
showing.''
   This reflected uncertainty within the market about the strength
of the latest advance, she suggested.
