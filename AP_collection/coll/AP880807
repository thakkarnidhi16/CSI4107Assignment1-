<HEAD>Atlanta's National Black Arts Festival Praised As Long Overdue</HEAD>

   The first National Black Arts Festival attracted
more than 150,000 people to see and hear everything from tap dance
to classical music to folk art, and organizers say they're already
working on festival number two.
   The 10-day series of events, which closed Sunday with the annual
Atlanta Jazz Festival, drew an enthusiastic response from the
artists as well as audiences, said Tom Cullen, director of the
Fulton County Arts Council.
   Organizers had not quite expected ``the emotional intensity of
the artistic interest,'' Cullen said. ``The evidence of what this
meant to the artists involved was really moving to me.''
   It was billed as the first national festival devoted to black
artistic talent.
   ``I think this one is outstanding, because it's the first black
festival and look where it is _ it's in Atlanta, said tap dancer
Louis Carpenter. ``At 76, I'm just glad to be a part of it.''
   Carpenter and four other members of the Copasetics, the
legendary New York-based tap dancing group founded in 1929,
performed on Saturday to a sold-out, racially mixed audience of 500.
   Cullen, whose council was the festival's primary sponsor, said
many of the audiences were multiracial.
   ``Overall, the involvement of white patrons of the arts was
pretty good, since we didn't really do a lot in a special way to
get white people to come to anything,'' he said.
   A mostly white audience of about 20,000 saw black classical
pianist Leon Bates perform with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in a
park July 31. Evenly mixed audiences, totaling about 30,000,
attended the seven performances of the musical ``The Apollo: It Was
Just Like Magic,'' starring Patti Austin and Peabo Bryson in a
tribute to the performers who appeared at New York's famous Apollo
Theater.
   Many events attracted mostly black audiences, as the festival
organizers had anticipated.
   ``It was important to a lot of local black people to see
enormously black audiences filling the halls. It disproved a lot of
stereotypical ideas about the cultural interest of the black
community,'' Cullen said.
   Among the events that attracted large crowds was the exhibition
of works by sculptor and printmaker Elizabeth Catlett-Mora; her
husband, painter Francisco Mora; and their son, painter and
sculptor David Catlett-Mora; and the play ``Sisters,'' by Atlanta
playwright Marsha Jackson.
   Cullen said a second festival in Atlanta is already in the works.
   ``The outpouring of interest and excitement was beyond anyone's
expectation,'' he said. ``It'll take us two years to effectively
organize another one. Then we might be able to do it every year.''
   The festival was not entirely without glitches. Choreographer
George Faison, who won a Tony award for ``The Wiz'' and directed
the festival's production of his 1981 off-Broadway hit ``The
Apollo,'' and Miss Austin had some complaints about malfunctioning
sound equipment and inadequately rehearsed musicians.
   ``The Fox Theater is a beautiful `barn,''' Faison said. ``But it
takes technical know-how to pull it off. This is a sophisticated
production that we're trying to do on a summer stock schedule.''
   Miss Austin, who ad libbed ``we need a new drummer'' after one
much-too-slow number, said ``The show was really in a state of
disarray.''
   But she added that the production provided much-needed stage
experience for young performers and said she hoped the festival
would be repeated to ``give these kids a chance to get work and to
experiment.''

<HEAD>Plastics Warehouse Blaze Reaches Four Alarms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-alarm fire roared through a plastics
warehouse in Houston Sunday evening, prompting the temporary
evacuation of a one-mile area, authorities said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   Houston Fire Chief Robert Clayton said late Sunday that the
blaze appeared to be contained, but that firefighters would have to
remain vigilant as it burned itself out.
   ``It's solid plastics and almost the same as gasoline,'' Clayton
said. ``That's why it's so hot. This is going to be a very long
night.''
   The fire at Premium Plastics Corp. broke out about 7 p.m. and
spread quickly through the 9-acre site in an industrial and
commercial section of south Houston.
   Petroleum-based polyvinyl chloride pellets caused small
explosions in the warehouse, officials said. PVC also releases
suffocating smoke when it burns, prompting officials to evacuate
the area around the warehouse.
   A small number of residents northeast of the warehouse, the
direction the wind was blowing, were asked to stay away from their
homes for about 90 minutes.
   Reggie Barham, a spokesman for Premium Plastics, said the fire
``wiped us out.''
   The company recycles plastics, he said.
   Smoke from the blaze could be seen 15 miles away.

<HEAD>Rallies Held For Disabled Woman In Dispute Between Parents,
Lesbian</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators rallied at a city park Sunday
in support of a disabled woman who is at the center of a legal
fight between her lesbian lover and her parents over custody and
visitation rights.
   Sharon Kowalski, a high school physical education teacher, has
been in a nursing home since an auto accident in 1983 left her
partly paralyzed and with reduced mental skills.
   Since then, her father, Donald Kowalski, and her roommate, Karen
Thompson, have battled over guardianship of Ms. Kowalski, whose
32nd birthday is Monday.
   Ms. Thompson, 40, a college professor, said she and Ms. Kowalski
bought a house together in St. Cloud, about 60 miles northwest of
Minneapolis, and considered themselves married.
   But after obtaining guardianship, Kowalski barred Ms. Thompson
from visiting his daughter, who is in a nursing home in the
northern Minnesota town of Hibbing.
   Ms. Thompson has solicited support from advocates of gay rights
and the disabled in her fight to have Ms. Kowalski control her own
destiny.
   The Minneapolis demonstration Sunday attracted about 100 people
who waved banners reading ``Bring Sharon Home.'' Organizers said
rallies were scheduled in 20 other cities on Sunday.
   In New York, a dozen protesters placed a wreath labeled ``Free
Sharon Kowalski'' inside St. Patrick's Cathedral before holding a
Mass across the street in a monthly protest of the Roman Catholic
Church's policy on homosexuality.
   Ms. Kowalski's parents, from rural Nashwauk, say their daughter
never told them she had a lesbian relationship with Ms. Thompson or
any other woman, and they have refused to acknowledge the
possibility that one may have existed.
   Her mother, Della Kowalski, says she has grown tired of the
legal battles and simply wants Ms. Thompson and the others to leave
her daughter alone.
   ``They're using Sharon for a cause,'' she says of Ms. Thompson's
supporters. ``I don't think they really care about Sharon. She's
laying there, helpless. She can't defend herself.''
   A Duluth District judge last month ordered an evaluation of Ms.
Kowalski, but barred Ms. Thompson from participating.
   But Ms. Thompson told the Minneapolis rally that even if the
tests show Ms. Kowalski is not competent to make her own decisions,
the evaluation will break Kowalski's control over his daughter.
   ``We are setting the stage for his removal as guardian,'' said
Ms. Thompson. ``If she types out she wants to see me, they'll have
to let me in.''
   Ms. Kowalski communicates by typing or gesturing.
   Karen Kingsley, a spokeswoman for the National Committee to Free
Sharon Kowalski, said the women's plight has meaning for
homosexuals and the group is encouraging them to obtain legal
agreements with each other.
   ``Lots of gay men are in the same position as Karen, not being
able to visit their ill partners, even having their homes taken as
the parents become guardians,'' Kingsley said.

<HEAD>Students Battle Police Over Border Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of radical students hurled
firebombs and rocks at riot police who foiled a campus rally Sunday
that was being held in support of talks with North Korean youths.
   The violence erupted when riot police sealed off Seoul's Korea
University to stop students from gathering in preparation for a
march to the border.
   Radical student groups have called for the march to the truce
village of Panmunjon near the border to hold talks Aug. 15 with
North Korean students on the unification of the divided peninsula.
   Also Sunday, the Korean news agency Yonhap said 11 policemen
were injured in the southern city of Kwangju when students attacked
a police station with firebombs and rocks. The incident followed a
clash between about 150 students and riot police at Chosun
University in Kwangju.
   The students were protesting a police ban on all rallies
advocating the march and the border talks. South Korean authorities
have said that any contacts with the North must be arranged through
government channels.
   Students from universities in Seoul and other cities planned to
gather at the Korea University campus in support of the march,
which was scheduled to start on Monday.
   ``Let's go to Panmunjom!'' about 500 students shouted as they
ran off the campus and hurled firebombs at riot police, who
responded with barrages of tear gas. It was not known if there were
any other injuries except several minor ones.
   The students chanted ``Yankee go home!'' and other anti-U.S.
slogans. Radical students claim the presence of about 41,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea prevents national unification.
   Police accused radical students of trying to use the march to
fan anti-government and anti-U.S. sentiment, saying it could create
social unrest and threaten preparations for the Sept. 17-Oct. 2
Olympic Games in Seoul.
   On Saturday, students armed with firebombs and rocks attacked a
U.S. Information Service office and police stations in Kwangju
after a campus rally advocating the border talks.
   A report Sunday by the official North Korean Central News Agency
denounced South Korean President Roh Tae-woo for making ``desperate
efforts'' to block the march to the border.
   The English-language report, monitored in Tokyo, said North
Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland
made the accusation in a statement issued Saturday following
demonstrations by radical South Korean students.
   The agency quoted the statement as saying moves by South Korean
authorities to block the student talks were ``an intolerable
challenge to the entire fellow countrymen who desire a successful
holding of North-South student talks.''
   It also said the North Korea government, which plans to send
student representatives to the planned talks, ``will ensure all
conditions for their realization.''

   Heavy fighting between Indian troops
and Tamil rebels claimed 10 lives in northern Sri Lanka on Sunday,
an Indian spokeswoman said.
   In central and southern Sri Lanka, Sinhalese extremists shot and
killed six people over the weekend, according to the Sri Lankan
military command.
   Eight guerrillas and two Indian soldiers died in the clash near
Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of Colombo, according to a
spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy.
   Three Indian soldiers were critically injured, she said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Sri Lankan command said the victims of Sinhalese attackers
included a Sinhalese army lieutenant who was on home leave in
Kuliyapitiya, 37 miles northeast of Colombo.
   A command spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
army Lt. C.M. Bandara was attacked Sunday by three young Sinhalese
on bicycles.
   Five other people were killed Saturday in the Sinhalese
heartland along the island nation's south coast. Police sources
said all of them were government supporters or were thought to be
police informers.
   About 50,000 Indian soldiers are deployed in Sri Lanka as a
peacekeeping force to try to end the Tamil insurrection against the
Sinhalese-dominated government and enforce a peace plan.
   Sinhalese extremists, who say the plan makes too many
concessions to the minority Tamils, have killed about 400
government officials and supporters since India and Sri Lanka
signed the accord July 29, 1987.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while Tamils account for 18 percent. Tamil rebels fighting for a
separate state say their ethnic group is discriminated against in
jobs and education.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Reduction of Ozone Over Major Soviet Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet scientists have discovered reductions of
the ozone layer over Moscow, Kiev and other major cities, a
newspaper said Sunday.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, the newspaper of the Russian republic, said
scientists found more than 50 cases of reductions in the
atmospheric layer. Ozone is a form of oxygen, and its layer in the
atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun and helps
regulate Earth's temperature.
   The paper suggested a lessening of the ozone layer could be the
reason for Moscow's unusually hot summer. It called on the Soviet
State Committee for Environmental Protection to begin a ``severe
struggle against violators of ecological laws.''
   ``It should be pointed out for fairness' sake that the ozone
layer was not destroyed completely. Some time later its thickness
returned to normal. However, the very fact of the thinning of the
ozone layer is extremely alarming,'' the report said.
   The newspaper said scientists working under the direction of
geographer E. Basmanov used computers to measure the ozone levels.
   It did not say when the measurements were taken, how big the
reductions were, or how long it took for the ozone layer to return
to normal. It did not name which cities other than Moscow or Kiev
were measured.
   Reductions in the ozone layer lead to increases in solar
heating, rapid air mass movement and temperature increases, it said.
   Scientists have blamed the escape of Freon into the atmosphere
from industrial processes and aerosol cans as one threat to the
ozone layer.
   Ecological damage is receiving increased attention in the
official Soviet press, in part because of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness on selected issues.
   The media have publicized citizen complaints about illnesses and
birth defects they believe to be caused by industrial pollution.

   A sandwich shop claims a 1,538-foot-long
submarine sandwich it made this weekend was the the world's
largest, complete with cold cuts, cheese, lettuce, tomato, olives
and onion on an Italian roll.
   Red Cross volunteers and employees of Subway Sandwiches And
Salads worked about 6{ hours at Richland Mall to make the sandwich,
which was 1,538 feet, 2 inches long, much larger than the current
record of 1,008 feet listed in the Guinness Book of World Records,
said Diane Micik, mall spokeswoman.
   It was one of several events scheduled to raise money for
American Red Cross disaster relief services.
   Also Saturday, Ken Solis, 31, of Greendale, Wis., took 71
minutes, 54 seconds to run 10 miles in the mall parking lot while
skipping rope, Ms. Micik said. The previous record was 76 minutes,
32 seconds, she said.

cocaine, an official said.
   The Ecuatoriana Airlines DC-10, which arrived from Quito, was
seized at Kennedy International Airport Saturday after cocaine was
found in luggage belonging to flight attendant Edwin Patricio
Aguirre, 28, said Customs spokesman Jeff Margalit.
   Officers found 14 pounds of cocaine in a false side of the
suitcase during a routine examination, Margalit said.
   Under the Customs Service's ``Zero Tolerance'' program,
Ecuatoriana faces a potential penalty of $220,000 and forfeiture of
the jet.
   Aguirre, of Ecuador, was held pending a detention hearing
Friday, authorities said.

<HEAD>New American Zoos: Cooped-Up Humans View Free-Roaming Beasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American zoos increasingly are becoming a place
where cooped-up humans view free-roaming beasts, and many
institutions are uniting to save endangered species and return them
to the wilderness.
   ``Animals aren't in cages any more. They're in spacious
enclosures, in a much more aesthetically pleasing environment,''
said Charles H. Hoessle, director of the St. Louis Zoo. ``Modern
exhibits are being designed to cater to their behavioral needs.''
   The trend is evident at the new Central Park Zoo, where
wilderness has been duplicated in the heart of the city. The
revamped facility opens to the public on Monday.
   Robert Wagner, executive director of the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which grants accreditation, said
the new Central Park Zoo ``clearly depicts the latest state of the
art.''
   Experts at the zoo let the animals tell them what changes to
make. For example, sea lions from the New York Aquarium were
invited to work the kinks out of the new pool. And other zoos are
finding ways to keep their animals entertained.
   ``It's quite common in ape exhibits to put sunflower seeds on
the floor so animals have something to do to keep them occupied, or
artificial termite mounds with honey or mustard,'' said Marvin
Jones, registrar of the San Diego Zoo. ``It's a way of easing their
boredom.''
   Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla., was a trend-setter in 1965,
enclosing visitors on a monorail while the gazelles and zebras
frolicked unfettered on 60 acres. In the early 1970s, drive-through
parks proliferated.
   Since then, realistic settings have multiplied. In 1987, the zoo
association's 132 members spent nearly $500 million building or
renovating exhibits, Wagner said. ``American zoos are in their
heyday,'' he said.
   ``The public has changed, due to television primarily. People
are able to see how animals live in the wild'' and expect no less
from zoos, Jones said.
   The Bronx Zoo's Jungle World, a 37,000-square-foot, indoor
microcosm opened in 1985, boasts five waterfalls, a cloud machine,
100 species of tropical plants and 780 animals, including
endangered Bali mynah birds.
   In St. Louis, school children and scholars can study ecology and
endangered species next spring while viewing one-celled animals and
a ``living model'' of a Missouri Ozarks stream at the zoo's new $16
million, 55,000-square-foot educational complex.
   Visitors in Atlanta perch on a wooden observation platform, a la
safari, to experience the world's only naturalistic, multifamily
gorilla complex. The zoo was renovated after it lost accreditation
amid grisly stories of animal abuse.
   ``Where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage, fresh,
bubbling water and open sky, it makes us feel a whole lot better _
and as far as I know, the animals like it better,'' said Gerald S.
Lentz, zoological manager of Busch Gardens, which boasts 21 Asian
elephants and other endangered species among its 3,300 mammals,
birds and reptiles.
   Such amenities are necessary: zoos must breed more endangered
species _ while at the same time captivating public sentiment for
that cause.
   While animals aren't fooled by fake jungles or fields, the
wildlife settings ``help provide the visitor with a sense of
appreciation for the conservation of wild places,'' Wagner said.
   ``Zoos are becoming a last resort for vanishing species.
Municipal peoples, who are furthest from wildlife but who support
zoos, are ultimately beginning to play an ever larger role in
helping to sustain wildlife,'' said Dr. William Conway, director of
the New York Zoological Society.
   ``The new role of zoos is coming about because there are too
damn many people,'' Conway said. ``Within the next 20 or 30 years,
we will lose, at the very least, 20 percent of the remaining plant
and animal species on earth.''
   Zoos are not only focusing their efforts on breeding endangered
species, such as San Diego's California condor program, but are
also educating the public about them.
   ``We don't give a darn if people know that Asian elephants have
the bigger ears and African elephants the smaller ears,'' Conway
said. ``But if they like elephants, they may reflect upon the
meaning of elephants the next time they tickle the ivory keys on
their piano that resulted in some elephant's death.''
   Zoo association members share endangered animals and
technologies. There are special breeding facilities operated in
Front Royal, Va., by the National Zoological Park; on St.
Catherines Island, Ga., by the New York Zoological Park, and the
Zoological Park of San Diego. The New York society's Wildlife
Conservation International sponsors scientists in 35 countries.
   There also is a zoo movement in reverse. In November, zoo
association members shipped endangered mynah birds back to Bali,
where agricultural development had gobbled their native rain
forests. Early reports are that the program is a success, Wagner
said.
   Similar successes have occurred with the return of black buck
antelopes to Pakistan; tamarin monkeys to Brazil, and Arabian
oryxes, another type of antelope, to Jordan, he said.
   ``There is no substitute for nature,'' Conway said. ``We seek,
instead, to be a salesman for nature.''

<HEAD>Constitution Does Not Allow Handguns, Former Justice Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release 2:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans enjoy no constitutional right to own
handguns, retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell said Sunday.
   ``It is not easy to understand why the (Constitution's) Second
Amendment, or the notion of liberty, should be viewed as creating a
right to own and carry a weapon that contributes so directly to the
shocking number of murders in our country,'' Powell said in a
speech prepared for delivery to the American Bar Association
convention in Toronto.
   Copies of the speech were made available to reporters here.
   Powell, whose speech dealt primarily with procedural delays in
capital punishment cases, blamed the soaring U.S. murder rate in
part on the availability of handguns.
   ``Much scholarly debate has centered on the extent to which the
Second Amendment applies to private ownership of arms, or is
restricted to the need for a well-regulated militia,'' Powell said.
   Powell said that even if the amendment applies to privately
owned guns, it does not apply ``with respect to handguns _ as
opposed to sporting rifles and shotguns.''
   The amendment states, ``A well regulated militia, being
necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people
to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''
   The Supreme Court has not ruled directly on the amendment's
scope.
   Powell cited FBI statistics that over 20,000 murders were
committed in the United States last year, and that about 60 percent
of them were committed with firearms.
   ``During the Vietnam War, some 58,021 Americans were killed,''
he said. ``During that same period in the United States,
approximately 122,000 Americans were murdered. Of those, over
70,000 were killed by firearms.''
   About drawn-out legal appeals in death penalty cases, Powell
said, ``Perhaps the time has come for the Congress, as it is free
to do, to take another thoughtful look at a system that no other
democracy deems necessary.''
   He was referring to the system in which a death row inmate,
after exhausting appeals in state courts, is allowed to turn to
federal courts for help.
   Noting that the time between a convicted murderer's crime and
his execution exceeds nine years in Georgia and Florida and
averages nearly eight years in Texas, Powell said, ``However this
delay may be characterized, it hardly inspires confidence or
respect by the public for our criminal justice system.''
   He added: ``In view of the unambiguous public support for
capital punishment, one would think the time has come for Congress
to give thoughtful consideration to making reasonable changes in
the federal law governing review of criminal convictions.
   ``It is now evident that our unique system of multiple and dual
collateral review is abused, particularly in capital cases. If
capital punishment cannot be enforced even where innocence is not
an issue and the fairness of the trial is not seriously questioned,
perhaps Congress and the state legislatures should take a serious
look'' at scrapping all death penalty laws, Powell said.
   Powell, who left the nation's highest court last summer,
recently was named by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to head a
U.S. Judicial Conference committee reviewing the capital punishment
appeals process.

   Whether they're called
``angels of mercy'' or ``vultures of war,'' the men who have
salvaged hundreds of blasted ships during the Iran-Iraq war say
they won't stop making money if peace breaks out.
   Since attacks on tankers began escalating in 1984, salvage
companies have scrambled for a share of the work once their radios
crackled with calls of ``Mayday, mayday.''
   Despite the danger from air attack, toxic chemicals and flames
so hot that steel ships sometimes melt into the water, salvage
companies persevere because claims on a single tanker can run into
the tens of millions of dollars.
   Large international firms like Smit Tak and Wijsmuller, both
Dutch firms, took the largest share of the work, setting up 24-hour
monitoring stations and fleets of fire-fighting tugs and launches.
   Meanwhile, local entrepreneurs sprang up along the coast from
Dubai's port town of Jebel Ali southeast to the entrance to the
Strait of Hormuz.
   ``Every man and his dog with a boat and a radio listening to
Channel 16 (the international marine emergency frequency) could
become a part-time salvager,'' according to one shipping executive.
   Iran and Iraq are now moving toward a cease-fire in the eight
year war, and if that happens, the work will change. Instead of
rapid response to mayday alerts, the tugs will work on clearing
ship hulks, reconstructing port facilities and dredging neglected
harbors.
   Shipping sources say dozens of dilapidated, war-damaged tankers
and support vessels from Iran's oil fleet may be ready for
demolition as scrap.
   In Dubai, scrap metal merchants bargain fiercely for recycled
steel to sell for industrial use in the Third World. A
supertanker's hull can bring in as much as $20 million.
   Another prime location for salvagers will be the Shatt Al-Arab
dividing Iran and Iraq, which has been closed since the war began.
Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit estimates that as many as 93
cargo vessels and smaller boats are stranded in the shallow estuary
at the northern tip of the Gulf.
   ``The Shatt Al-Arab is a potential gold mine,'' said a surveyor
making plans for a large international company that specializes in
salvaging ships for refitting or resale as scrap.
   Walter Mckenzie, principal surveyor for the Dubai branch of the
Salvage Association, told the Associated Press, ``Once a definite
peace agreement is signed, there should be a dull period of
assessment (of damages) of about six months to a year, and then an
enormous amount of business expansion.''
   During the war, salvagers have been criticized because of the
speed and aggressiveness with which they race to a battered,
burning or sinking ship; the first tug on the spot usually wins the
business.
   But the salvagemen defend their role. ``Hell, yes, I make money,
big money,'' said one who spoke on condition he not be named. ``But
I'm no vulture,'' he added. ``I'm an angel of mercy who just
happens to get paid for saving ships, cargos, and mens' lives.''
   Most shipping sources spoke on condition their names not be
mentioned, just as they have done throughout the tanker war, for
fear of provoking Iraq or Iran into an attack on their vessels or
for fear of compromising their business relations with either party.
   According to Lloyd's, 546 tankers, freighters and small boats
have been caught and damaged or sunk in the tanker war.
   The salvagers make their money from insurers such as Lloyd's of
London; before the salvage tugs go to work, even in the most
dangerous situations, a damaged ship's master must agree to abide
by Lloyd's Open Form, which says that a reasonable fee will be
negotiated if the rescue is successful.
   It can take years to settle payments, which are sometimes
decided under arbitration. Although sometimes no salvage fee is
awarded, the figure can spiral to $50 million for a badly damaged
supertanker.
   Several tugs have been damaged by air attacks, and others have
been damaged or sunk while trying to make good a rescue.
   On January 27, the 740-ton tug Salverve took the 225,668-ton
Cypriot tanker Coral Cape under tow after an Iraqi missile attack
that killed two South Korean seamen. The Iraqis came back, blasting
the Salverve and killing its British captain and his Filipino chief
engineer.
   In another attack, the world's biggest supertanker, the
565,000-ton Seawise Giant, on charter to Iran, was hit by three
Iraqi bombs. To one side, the 235,000-ton Spanish tanker Barcelona,
took two hits. On the other side, the Greek-registered Argosy
escaped the warplanes but was destroyed by fire.
   ``She just cooked in burning oil so hot that she actually melted
down in the water,'' said one source. Eighteen lives were lost in
the attack.
   Salvage tugs gathered around the inferno of tankers and spilling
crude oil. Three days later they were still wetting down the
smoldering hulks when the Barcelona erupted in a secondary
explosion.
   A tug from the Scandanavian salvage company Scan-Act vanished;
the vessel and its nine-man crew were believed to have been sucked
into the Barcelona and incinerated. Three men on a Belgian tug also
died, and three more tugs were destroyed by fire.

   A 71-year-old man charged with robbing a
small-town bank of $400 told authorities that was the amount he
needed to pay his bills, police said Sunday.
   James Luther Hogue of Marion works part-time as a painter and
receives a monthly Social Security check, but still apparently did
not have the cash to cover his monthly expenses, said Police Chief
Robert Hester.
   ``He seems like a pretty nice fellow,'' Hester said.
   Ernie Brady, president of Uniontown's First State Bank, said a
man with ``some white in his hair'' walked into the crowded bank
lobby Saturday and gave a note to a teller.
   ``Give me $400 and nobody will get hurt'' was scribbled on the
note, Brady said. The teller took the note to Brady, who walked out
of his office to meet the man.
   ``I asked him if he was for real on this thing _ I could see the
tip of the gun sticking out of his pocket,'' he said.
   Brady said he directed the man to the front of the building so
he would be in the view of a surveillance camera and told the
teller to give him the money.
   The man took the money and fled, while Brady ran back to his
office for his own gun.
   When the man started to drive away, Brady got the attention of
another driver who blocked the car with his pickup. Brady then held
a gun on the man until Hester arrived.
   The money was recovered and the gun was found under the seat of
the car.
   ``He was so old I asked him why he did it,'' Hester said. ``He
said that he needed the money to pay his bills.''
   The man did not specify what kind of bills he owed, Hester said.
Hogue remained in jail on Sunday.

<HEAD>U.S. Worries About Africa's Refugees; Sends Team to Somalia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials, concerned about hundreds of
thousands of refugees in the war-torn Horn of Africa, are sending a
team to Somalia this week to try to figure out what can be done to
help people.
   Rebel fighting in Somalia on Africa's east coast has caused more
than 200,000 refugees to flee into Ethiopia, moving at the rate of
1,000 a day since heavy fighting erupted last May, officials say.
   Ironically, Ethiopia, one of Africa's poorest countries headed
by a Marxist dictatorship, has been a haven in recent months for
refugees from Somalia to its east and Sudan to the west.
   Still, there are more Ethiopian refugees living in Sudan and
Somalia than Sudanese and Somalis living in Ethiopia.
   ``The whole Horn of Africa is in turmoil,'' said Patricia Fagan,
a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commission on Refugees.
   When Somali refugees arrive by foot in Ethiopia, there is
nothing for them at the camps run by Ethiopian relief workers,
Fagan said. Water is scarce and shelters have yet to be built, she
said.
   ``The Somali situation for us is confused,'' she said. ``This is
anxious.''
   Complicating the picture is that fighting in northern Somalia is
occurring near the camps where 370,000 Ethiopian refugees live, she
said.
   The U.S. government has dispatched a three-person team to
Somalia to find out more about conditions in the remote northern
part of the pastoral country, according to Bart Kull, a spokesman
for the Agency for International Development.
   ``Because of the war, we are in the dark,'' he said. ``Their
purpose is to try to assess what may be needed in terms of
humanitarian assistance.''
   The fighting, however, may prevent the U.S. team from going near
the northern area, officials said. U.N. officials evacuated their
people from the region in June for safety reasons, Fagan said.
   The 7-year-old civil war is being waged by the Somali National
Movement, which is seeking to oust Maj. Gen. Mohammed Siad Barre,
the government leader. Amnesty International, the British-based
human rights organization, recently asked Siad Barre to investigate
``unlawful killings'' in northern Somalia.
   The U.N. has put out an emergency appeal for $11 million to help
the Somali refugees in Ethiopia, but U.S. officials say they have
little extra money for them.
   As worrisome as the Somali situation are recent developments in
southern Sudan where rebels are battling the government. The result
is that 300,000 Sudanese, many weakened by starvation, have walked
to Ethiopia to four refugee camps.
   ``Most of the people arrive in awful, awful shape,'' Fagan said.
They go to the camps where water is scarce and food is limited
because ``even so, they have a chance of being fed.'' The Ethiopian
government refuses to allow U.N. officials or foreign aid workers
to stay in the camps.
   Roger Winter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private
group, recently visited southern Sudan where he said he saw
starving people, hospitals without electricity or antibiotics and
plagues affecting cattle.
   Altogether, nearly a million Sudanese have been displaced as a
result of civil strife in the south.
   ``Policies pursued by the governments of Ethiopia and the Sudan
pose a greater threat to large numbers of their people than does
the renewed drought,'' Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, said last month
at a congressional hearing on the food situation in the two
countries.

<TEXT>
   Official Burmese newspapers were quoted
as saying Sunday that five people were killed and an undetermined
number were wounded during anti-government demonstrations over the
weekend.
   Students in Rangoon, the Burmese capital, called for a
nationwide general strike Monday.
   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua, reporting from Rangoon,
quoted official newspapers as saying police opened fire Saturday to
quell demonstrations in three cities.
   The reports said daylong demonstrations in Pegu, 50 miles north
of Rangoon, were crushed when police opened fire, killing two
people and wounding one.
   In the central Burmese town of Yenangyang, one person was
wounded when police fired on about 2,000 protesters who defied an
order banning demonstrations, the reports said.
   Xinhua did not say where the other casualties occured or what
happened at Thanatpin, the third city where a protest was reported.
   Authorities also issued orders banning all public gatherings,
speech-making, marches and agitation, Xinhua said.
   Martial law was clamped on Rangoon last Wednesday after
demonstrations demanding the ouster of new hard-line leader Sein
Lwin. The capital was reported tense but quiet Friday and Saturday.
   In recent days, pamphlets reportedly written by student
activists have been circulated in Rangoon calling for a general
nationwide strike Monday.
   Soldiers armed with bayonets patrolled the streets of the
capital Saturday as authorities began selling basic foodstuffs to
counteract soaring prices and hoarding, officials and returning
travelers said.
   Rangoon-based diplomats have linked the price hikes, hoarding
and other immediate economic hardships to the demonstrations and
general tensions in Burma following a major political upheaval.
   Sein Lwin was elected last month as both president and head of
the sole political party following the abrupt resignation of leader
Ne Win after a 26-year rule. He has promised economic reforms but
appears to be moving rapidly to wipe out all political dissent.
   Just days after his election he ordered the arrests of the most
outspoken critic of the authoritarian system, former Brig. Gen.
Aung Gyi, along with other dissidents and Associated Press
correspondent Sein Win.
   Authorities also arrested 149 people, including a number of
students, in connection with protests last week in Rangoon.
   Official Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said Sunday
authorities had obtained the names of those ``who pulled the
strings from behind the scenes'' _ apparently at last week's
protests _ and had released 80 prisoners from the city's Insein
prison. It gave no further details.
   Students have been at the forefront of resistance to Sein Lwin,
whom they blame for ordering the bloody suppression of protests in
Rangoon in March and June.
   Students first appeared on the Burmese political scene in 1920
when they staged a successful boycott of universities in the
country. They contributed substantially to the struggle for
independence from Great Britain.
   Since 1962, Burmese students have led or participated in
anti-government demonstrations on 10 occasions, including three
since last fall.
   Another traditional source of resistance has been the Buddhist
monkhood, although in recent years the government has attempted to
control the monkhood's activities.
   Rangoon radio said Home and Religous Affairs Minister Maj. Gen.
Pe Myaing met with the chief Buddhist authority to urge that monks
not participate in anti-government disturbances. The radio said
that patriarch, whose name was not given, agreed monks should not
become involved.

<TEXT>
   A Beirut newspaper said Sunday that
Western hostages in Lebanon were held in three locations, including
the Iranian Embassy, under the control of an Iranian official.
   The Ad-Diyar newspaper also said there was a ``certain
flexibility'' regarding the release of British hostages, while the
fate of the other missing foreigners was linked to the developments
in the Persian Gulf war.
   But the Ad-Diyar report also said Iran still was insisting on
the release of 17 pro-Iranian activists held in Kuwait for bombing
the U.S. and French embassies there Dec. 3, 1983.
   Ad-Diyar, which is based in Christian east Beirut, started
publishing just four months ago. Its report was attributed to an
unidentified Syrian security source, and it could not be confirmed.
   Syrian and Lebanese security officials have long contended that
most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon were held in the main
barracks of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Hay Madi distrtict in
south Beirut's slums.
   ``The foreign hostages in Lebanon are divided into three groups
and held in three different locations,'' Ad-Diyar said. It said the
three groups were in the Hezbollah barracks, the Iranian Embassy
and in the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, a town in Lebanon's
east Bekaa Valley.
   It said Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite was among the group
held in Baalbek. Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving his
west Beirut hotel on a mission to negotiate the hostages' release.
   No other names or nationalities of hostages were mentioned in
the report.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is believed to an umbrella group
for various pro-Iranian extremist factions holding hostages.
   The three locations listed are policed by Syrian forces. Syria
has 40,000 troops in eastern and northern Lebanon as well as in
west Beirut and its southern suburbs.
   Ad-Diyar said the hostages ``are controlled by a Hezbollah wing
which answers directly to Tehran.''
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hossein Sheikholeslam, was in
Beirut when Syria sent an estimated 2,500 troops into the southern
slums to quell three weeks of bloody fighting between Hezbollah and
the rival Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia in May.
   Ad-Diyar said Sheikholeslam managed to smuggle some of the
hostages from Hay Madi to Baalbek and to the Iranian Embassy in
another part of south Beirut before the Syrians moved in. It did
not elaborate on Sheikholeslam's alleged role.
   ``There is a certain flexibility regarding the release of the
British hostages after relations improved between Iran and
Britain,'' Ad-Diyar said.
   ``But the fate of the other hostages will remain closely linked
to the developments in the U.N. Security Council concerning the
Iran-Iraq war,'' the daily added.
   Britain said early this month it was reviewing its strained
relations with Iran following the latter's acceptance of Security
Council Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the
8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Nine Americans are among the 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985 in
Moslem west Beirut.

<TEXT>
   A defective wheel bearing was the apparent
cause of a freight train derailment that started a nine-hour fire,
released a cloud of hazardous gas and displaced 600 residents, a
railroad official said Sunday.
   A preliminary investigation showed that the bearing apparently
burned off a wheel of one of the train's 113 cars, causing 14 cars
to derail and hit chemical and fuel tanks Saturday, said Brian
Sweeney, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Railroad.
   Missouri Highway 79 was re-opened for traffic Sunday morning,
except for the area immediately surrounding the crash site, said
Rob Brown, public relations officer for the Boone County Fire
District.
   People who were forced to spend the night in a church and school
near this eastern Missouri town were allowed back into their homes
at about 11 a.m. Sunday, after workers had removed anhyrdous
ammonia from a leaking tank.
   The evacuation was ordered after several rail cars caught fire
when they derailed at about 6 a.m. en route from Galesburg, Ill.,
to St. Louis.
   The fire took more than nine hours to contain, but firefighters
kept the blaze from igniting nearly 28,000 gallons of diesel,
kerosene and gasoline being stored nearby.
   Residents were not allowed to return home after the fire was
extinguished, because anhydrous ammonia was leaking from a
punctured tank. The ammonia is dangerous to respiratory systems and
can cause severe burns, said Troy Fire Chief Gerald Cherry.
   Several firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze,
but no injuries were reported by residents or the train's crew.
   Ronnie Herrin, 49, a train buff who witnessed the accident, said
he heard the sound of metal crashing and banging.
   ``I knew what it was,'' he said. ``You know how people say when
a tornado goes through that it sounded like a freight train? Well,
this sounded like a tornado.''

<HEAD>Senators Call For EPA Action Against Ocean Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency should do
more to stop ocean dumping and curb pollution, two Democratic
senators from New Jersey said Sunday.
   ``Their (EPA's) job is to protect the public health and safety
and they are failing in that job,'' Sen. Bill Bradley said on ABC's
``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Bradley chastised the EPA for not setting up a medical tracking
system that would require hospitals to keep a record of waste to
ensure that it is taken to a disposal facility.
   ``Every week in New York City 500,000 pounds of medical waste is
taken out of the city and nobody knows where it goes,'' Bradley
said. ``With a tracking system you would track that to make sure it
got to a disposal facility.''
   Bradley said he has introduced legislation in Congress to set up
a tracking system that might be able to prevent a recurrence of
what happened this summer when medical waste including vials of
contaminated blood and used bandages washed up on beaches in New
York and New Jersey.
   Bradley's colleague in the Senate, Frank Lautenberg, said the
EPA had not used the authority available to it to take steps to
curb the dumping of infectious wastes.
   Lee Thomas, EPA's administrator, defended his agency's record.
   ``We've worked hard, both using our enforcement authority as
well as our funding authority,'' Thomas said on CBS's ``Face the
Nation.'' ``As I said, the problem is a big one. It's going to take
a lot more than just us.''
   Thomas said the result of the EPA's work is that nearly every
state has a medical waste management program. He said EPA is
applying pressure on New York City to get it to stop dumping.
   Finally, however, Thomas said local, state and federal
government will have to cooperate to spend the billions of dollars
needed to ensure that the oceans are kept clean.

   Mechanics reconnected pipes and
electrical lines on the space shuttle Discovery on Sunday after
exchanging a part that caused a computer to scrub a crucial
test-firing of the shuttle's main engines.
   The one-inch hydrogen bleed valve, and the sensor that reports
its open or closed position, were removed and replaced Saturday
inside the shuttle's cramped engine compartment.
   ``Everything is going perfectly so far,'' said Lisa Mallone,
spokeswoman for NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
   ``We might set a new date for the test-firing tomorrow, if
everything continues to go well.''
   Still ahead were the tasks of checking the reconnected lines for
leaks, and electrical checks on the engine system, including the
new valve.
   The valve, which must be closed during engine firing, was
reported by the faulty sensor to be partially open Thursday, and
computers stopped the hot-fire test.
   A successful test is required before the shuttle can be launched
on America's first manned mission since the Challenger disaster in
1986. No launch date has been set but a launch appears to be
impossible until at least early October.

   An 18-month-old boy briefly left
alone in a car with the motor running shifted the car into drive,
sending it into a group of campers and decapitating a 2-year-old
boy, police said.
   The dead boy's mother became hysterical after being injured in
the accident Friday at San Clemente State Park.
   ``The mother of the child, she pointed at Hollee (Groff, mother
of the boy in the car) and she said, `She murdered him, she killed
him!''' said Melvin Oatis of San Clemente, the surviving child's
uncle.
   ``Hollee grabbed her son and made sure he was all right. Then
she fell to the ground in shock,'' he said.
   Dylan Clark Bloodworth died instantly after the station wagon
pinned his head ahead against a post. The vehicle also struck
Dylan's mother, Sheri Marie Bloodworth, 27, of Arlington, Texas,
who suffered head injuries, and his grandmother, Joanne Marie
Ferguson, 44, of Mission Viejo, who suffered four broken ribs.
   ``I just managed to get out of the way,'' said Stevie Ferguson,
Mrs. Bloodworth's aunt. ``They didn't even see the car until it was
on top of them. At first, we all thought it was a drunk driver.''
   Both families were camping at the park, according to California
Highway Patrol officer Jim Feick and park chief ranger Rich
Gililland.
   Ms. Groff, 31, of Temecula, was preparing to leave and stopped
her station wagon to retrieve some belongings, they said.
   She put the automatic transmission in park but left the engine
running because she had been having trouble starting it. She told
officers she was gone less than one minute, Feick and Gililland
said. The emergency brake apparently was not set.
   Her son, Caleb Jordan Groff, who was in the back seat, squeezed
out of his car seat and shifted the car into drive, sending it down
a 100-foot incline where it struck the three victims outside their
tent.
   Ms. Ferguson said that despite her niece's initial outburst, she
did not think Ms. Groff should be charged.
   ``She feels like I do,'' the aunt said. ``She knows that poor
girl didn't do it on purpose.''
   No charges have been filed and an investigation was under way,
the CHP said.

   The once-maligned Zoo Atlanta has built a new
home for its orangutans that gives the natural hambones room to
show off and feel more at home than they would in a cage.
   The key is that the new half-acre ``Orangutans of Ketambe''
exhibit, which opened to the public Saturday, provides a place for
the endangered red apes to climb as they do in the rain forests of
their native Borneo or Sumatra.
   ``When they are kept in a cage that doesn't have good climbing
opportunities, they stay on the floor, and look like a big, red
rug,'' said Zoo Director Terry Maple. ``The way to see a male
orangutan is when he stretches out, hanging by one hand from some
material that looks like a tree.''
   The habitat has two tall trees, other structures for climbing
and ropes that look like vines, enabling the primates to climb as
high as 40 feet.
   ``Very few zoos have built a habitat that was correct for this
animal. We spent more money on the gorillas than we have on the
orangutans, but I think we've built an innovative habitat,'' said
Maple, a primate behavior specialist who helped build the zoo's
reputation for orangutan breeding and research.
   The orangutan habitat is the latest stage in a $26 million
renovation of the 99-year-old zoo, which just four years ago was
rated by the U.S. Humane Society as one of the nation's worst zoos.
   At that time, some star animals died, and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture slapped sanctions on the zoo for poor animal-care
record-keeping.
   Despite the zoo's problems, ``We've had a very consistent and
remarkable record of breeding orangutans,'' Maple said. ``These
animals have been cared for all these years by Dr. Brent Swenson
and his associates at the primate center.
   Maple said moving the orangutans outdoors is a natural step for
the zoo.
   ``Once they learn to live outdoors, we expect them to be
climbing, positioning themselves high above the public. We think
that's how they should be seen,'' Maple said. ``It will be a
gradual process as they start behaving like orangutans again, since
they haven't had a chance to climb very much in captivity.''

   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan warned Pakistan
on Sunday about its support for Afghan guerrillas, but Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the withdrawal of
Soviet soldiers would finish on schedule.
   ``In a few days, our divisions no longer will be in 25 Afghan
provinces. We don't have any doubts that the withdrawal will be
completed in the intended term,'' he told the official Afghan news
agency Bakhtar.
   Under an agreement in April signed by the Soviet Union in
Geneva, half of its about 100,000 soldiers are to be out of
Afghanistan by Aug. 15, and Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union
would meet that deadline.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass released texts of a joint
Soviet-Afghan statement and the Soviet foreign minister's interview
with Bakhtar in Kabul. Shevardnadze returned to Moscow Sunday after
a four-day visit to Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   Both sides continued their criticism of Pakistan, which
Shevardnadze accused last week of ``international terrorism'' for
its support of the Afghan guerrillas.
   But the Soviet foreign minister's remarks Sunday indicated his
country was not contemplating a change in its withdrawal schedule
because of guerrilla activity.
   The Soviet Union has said it reserves the right to change the
schedule of its troop pullout if what it calls outside interference
continues in Afghanistan.
   But Shevardnadze's statement indicated all Soviet soldiers will
be out of the country by Feb. 15, 1989, the date set by the Geneva
agreement, also signed by Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United
States.
   Sunday's Afghan-Soviet statement accused Pakistan of violating
the agreement, continuing to send arms and equipment into
Afghanistan and failing to dismantle guerrilla camps on its
territory.
   ``The obstructionist line of the Pakistani authorities, if it
further continues, may lead to the loss by the Geneva process of
the positive essence contained in it, in the conditions when one of
the main parties to the Geneva accords does not observe their main
provisions,'' it said.
   ``This situation cannot but make the Soviet Union and
Afghanistan draw the necessary conclusions and determine their
actions if an end is not put to interference in Afghanistan's
affairs,'' it said.
   It said nothing more specific about what steps they might take.
   The statement also called on the United States to pressure
Pakistan to abide by the agreement.
   In another dispatch, Tass said the final contingent of Soviet
soldiers had left Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and were on
their way home. After the withdrawal of soldiers stationed in
Kandahar and in Helmand, no more Soviet soldiers will be in
southern Afghanistan, Tass said.
   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to support
the pro-Moscow government and remained to fight the insurgents.
More than 13,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed and about 35,000
wounded in the fighting.

   An off-duty New York City police
officer shot and killed a man and wounded three teen-agers who
attacked him in his yard with a baseball bat Sunday when he tried
to stop a fight, authorities said.
   The fight broke out at a party next door to officer Kris
Brandt's house and spilled into his yard about 1:20 a.m., police
said.
   Brandt saw someone being beaten with a bat, went to help, and
some members of the crowd turned on him, striking him with the bat,
said Salvatore Yovino, a spokesman for the Suffolk County Police
Department.
   Brandt then fired four shots.
   Joseph Buonavita, 19, of East Northport, died of a gunshot wound
to the chest, police said.
   An unidentified teen-ager underwent surgery at Huntington
Hospital and was listed in stable condition. Two others received
minor wounds.
   Brandt was in stable condition at St. John's Hospital with a
severe head wound, broken ribs, cuts and bruises, police said.

<HEAD>Writer Calls For Removing Stalin's Body From Kremlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Josef Stalin's body should be removed from its
place of honor at the Kremlin wall because of the crimes he
committed during his nearly three decades of rule, a writer said in
an article published Sunday.
   ``The fact that the main criminal `of all times and peoples' to
this time rests at the Kremlin wall next to (Lenin's) mausoleum _
isn't this an outrage?'' wrote Alexander Veinshtein, director of
cultural affairs for a Moscow factory that produces electrical
equipment.
   His article in the latest weekly edition of the magazine Ogonyok
refers to the praise the dictator received in the Soviet Union
during his lifetime as the ``greatest leader of all times and all
peoples.''
   Veinshtein's biting criticism is unusual even for today's Soviet
media, which is exposing the repressions under Stalin in which
millions of people died. It was the first public proposal to move
Stalin's remains from the Kremlin wall, the highest place of honor
for Soviet heroes.
   The body of Vladimir Lenin, who led the 1917 revolution, is also
preserved in a mausoleum at the Kremlin wall.
   Ogonyok said it is planning an exhibition of proposals for a
monument to Stalin's victims in October and November at the House
of Culture that Veinshtein directs.
   An unofficial group collected about 30,000 signatures this year
demanding that officials approve construction of such a monument in
Moscow. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressed his support in
early July.
   Ogonyok said it also is planning a week of films, plays and
photography dealing with Stalinism.

<HEAD>Kirk Calls on Bush to Debate, Blasts GOP Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party chief said Sunday the
Republican platform would be all platform and no performance, and
he called on George Bush to debate Michael Dukakis three times
before the November presidential election.
   At a Boston news conference the day before the Republicans sit
down in New Orleans to draft their platform, Democratic National
Committee Chairman Paul Kirk and U.S. Rep. William Gray,
D-Pennsylvania, said the Republican Party platform may look fine on
paper to moderate voters. In practice, they said, the Republicans
have failed to live up to a host of promises they made in 1984.
   Gray, who chaired the Democratic platform committee in Atlanta
last month, said the Republican platform will likely make many
promises palatable to Democrats. ``They'll say `we're for human
rights in South Africa, but we're not going to oppose apartheid,'''
Gray said.
   In attacking the Republican platform, the Democrats mimicked a
tactic used by the Republicans earlier this summer before the
Democratic National Convention. The Republican barrage came in a
``fact-fiction'' format in which Democratic promises were compared
with delivery.
   On Sunday, Kirk's aides handed out a release based on a similar
``promise vs. fact'' format.
   The release said, for example, that the Reagan administration
promised in 1984 to get tough on terrorists only to later trade
arms for hostages with Iran; that after promising to hold public
officials to the highest standards, 242 administration officials
resigned under indictment, scandal or the threat of prosecution;
and that despite a commitment to health care, 37 million Americans
lack health insurance;and the 1984 GOP platform failed to even
mention AIDS.
   Kirk and his Republican counterpart, Frank Farhenkopf,
co-chaired a commission that earlier this year proposed holding
three debates between the presidential nominees and one between the
vice presidential candidates.
   ``When it became clear that George Bush was to be the nominee,
the signals changed,'' Kirk said. ``George Bush was not going to
make a commitment.''
   Top aides to Bush were quoted recently as saying the vice
president would prefer only one debate with Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor.
   But Bush said Sunday in Kennebunkport, Maine, that he would hold
more than one debate but would not specify how many, when or where.
   ``There will be debates, and I look forward to them,'' Bush
said. ``But I'm not the nominee of our party yet and we have plenty
of time to determine how many, where and all of that.''
   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many...has not been
sorted out yet,'' he said.
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen also said Sunday that Bush
planned to wait until he officially receives the Republican
nomination before deciding on a debating format.
   Kirk and Gray acknowledged that the Democrats are trying to
unseat the Republicans from the White House at a time when
unemployment is down and the economy is strong.
   ``Yes, there are some good signs out there. Unemployment is
down. Economic growth is still strong,'' Gray said. But he said
that Bush, ``sees that the sun is shining today and he jumps to the
conclusion that the sun will shine tomorrow and the next day and
forever.''
   Gray used a Bush term in describing the vice president's deficit
reduction plan as ``voodoo'' budgeting. And Bush's flexible freeze
proposal to trim federal spending, Gray said, ``is flexible frozen
fruitcake.''
   Fahrenkopf did not immediately return phone calls from his
office in New Orleans where he is preparing for the GOP convention.

   The sandbags in front of buildings were still
there. So were the windows with tape across them to prevent
shattering in a missile explosion, and the yellow signs showing the
way to the nearest air-raid shelter.
   But most residents of Tehran, a city of 8 million, seemed
convinced Sunday that these remnants from the last Iraqi missile
attacks in April will disappear before long.
   In New York, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said his
government accepted an Iraqi offer for direct peace talks following
a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war. U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said a truce could take effect within two weeks.
   There were no sensational headlines in Iran's afternoon
newspapers, which came out before the developments in New York but
after Tehran radio announced Iraq's offer.
   ``New Developments in U.N. Talks for Cease-Fire'' said the small
headline in the Ettela'at newspaper, announcing that Baghdad had
dropped its demand for face-to-face talks before a cease-fire.
   ``Iraqi Regime Under Pressure of World Public Opinion Has
Accepted Cease-Fire,'' read the headline in Kayhan, the other main
afternoon paper.
   Iranians in the street did not seem surprised by news of the
developments, which broke an impasse in U.N. negotiations between
the two belligerents. There were few signs of exuberance.
   ``People were sure the end would come sooner or later,'' said
Said, a middle-aged, English-speaking businessman. ``Iranians know
very well what's going on in the world, perhaps better than many
Westerners.''
   ``Sure, I am happy this will be over at last,'' said Hussein, a
young employee of a well-stocked children's shoe shop who spoke
only broken English. Eiradj, who introduced himself as a former air
force officer, said: ``It is a good thing, it is the end.''
   Speaking only a smattering of English, Eiradj explained he had
tried to obtain political asylum in West Germany in 1985 but had
been refused. His gesturing seemed to indicate he would not try
again.
   ``What did the Iraqis want in direct talks?'' asked Yussuf, an
Iranian businessman. He arrived the night before, his first visit
home since he left to study in the United States before the Islamic
revolution that brought the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini into power
in 1979.
   ``Do they (Iraq) want to tell us that they started the war, they
were the first to attack the tankers, and they used chemical arms
against our people?'' Yussuf asked.
   Rumors circulated here that the sharp fall of the dollar on the
black market had prompted several suicides or attempted suicides.
   Several exchange dealers, according to the rumors, had jumped to
their deaths from a high-rise building in Ferdovzi Street, said to
be a center of foreign exchage trading.
   The Iranian riyal rose sharply against the dollar and other
currencies because of increased demands for Iranian currency in
hopes of a post-war boom in the Iranian economy.
   The dealers had hoarded dollars in the belief that their value
would continue to rise against the U.S. currency. When the reverse
happened in the past few weeks, they lost their speculative profits.
   The dollar was unofficially quoted at 300 riyals at noon Sunday.
This compared to 785 on Aug.1, and 1,480 before Iran accepted a
cease-fire resolution 598 on July 20.
   The driver of a vintage Chevrolet said he bought his well-kept
car second- hand eight years ago for 3.5 million rials and two
months ago, he was offerered 10 million for it.
   ``Now the price is back where it was in 1981,'' he said with a
grin. ``That means the war is over.''
   Iraq's neighbors in the Persian Gulf praised Baghdad leadership
for agreeing to defer direct talks with Iran until after a
cease-fire, paving the way for a truce.
   Bahrain's Crown Prince Sheik Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa said the
move ``will be of benefit and stability for the nations of the
region.''
   In Kuwait, the country closest to the warfront, an official
spokesman said the country's Cabinet ``expressed profound interest
in the ... turn of the Iraq-Iran war to peace.''

<TEXT>
   An long feud between Turkey and Greece could
hurt the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis, with
Turkish-Americans worried about how the son of Greek immigrants
would repay some political debts if elected.
   Vastly outweighed by the numbers and resources of
Greek-Americans, Turkish-Americans are feeling as embattled as they
did when Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey in 1975 to
punish it for invading the predominantly Greek island of Cyprus.
   Their fears are compounded by the surge of political activity in
the Greek-American community, whose estimated 1 million members
have been galvanized by the prospect of having one of their own run
the White House.
   Prominent Turkish-Americans concede Dukakis would probably do
what's best for the country as a whole. But they say his
indebtedness for the massive support of the Greek-American
community may cause him to appoint some of those supporters to key
posts.
   ``My feeling is that Dukakis is an honorable man,'' said Ayhan
Hakimoglu, chairman of Aydin Corporation in Horsham, Pa., which
manufactures high-technology defense and telecommunications
products. But Dukakis was helped by massive contributions from the
Greek-American community, ``and they'll make demands on him. He'll
be under pressure,'' said Hakimoglu.
   Greek-Americans account for between 15 percent and 25 percent of
Dukakis' campaign contributions.
   With his family and friends, Hakimoglu said, he raised more than
$100,000 for Bush. But he stressed that his support of the
Republican candidate is motivated not only by Turkish
considerations but also by his free-market economic policies.
   Turkish-Americans have felt secure with the Reagan
administration, which has consistently stressed Turkey's importance
as NATO's second-largest military force and its strategic location
as a buffer between the Soviet Union and Europe.
   The United States gives Turkey $10 for every seven it gives
Greece, also a NATO ally but with a smaller military force and more
robust economy.
   Turkish American leaders point to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a college
friend of Dukakis' and one of the architects of the 1975 embargo
against Turkey, as a potential enemy if Dukakis gets to the White
House.
   Whether he gets an administration job or remains on Capitol
Hill, leaders of the Turkish-American community are concerned the
Greek-American lawmaker would influence Dukakis into adopting
anti-Turkish stands.
   Erol Ozdemir, who runs the only Turkish-American political
action committee in the United States, says he hopes to raise
$400,000 in this election cycle for campaign contributions and
voter registration drives. In 1986 his group _ the Assembly of
Turkish American Associations _ raised $75,000.
   ``Most Turkish-Americans will support Bush because he believes
in a strong NATO and because they're concerned that Dukakis would
interfere with Turkish-American relations,'' said Ozdemir, a
certified public accountant whose father came from Turkey.
   One of the issues at the heart of the Turkish lobby's drive
since its inception in 1985 has been an attempt to defeat a
resolution condemning Turkey for the massacre of nearly 2 million
Armenians between 1915 and 1923. Under pressure from the Reagan
administration and the Turkish lobby, the resolution was narrowly
defeated three times.
   Dukakis has promised to support such a resolution. In a letter
to the Armenian community, Dukakis said the rights of Armenians and
the human rights abuse they suffer in Turkey and elsewhere
``cannot, and must not, be ignored or compromised for reasons of
political expediency.''
   Turkish-Americans are also worried about Dukakis' policies
toward Cyprus. They are concerned he would call for the withdrawal
of all Turkish forces from the island even before a peace
settlement between feuding Turks and Greeks on Cyprus is worked out.
   The question of Cyprus, long dormant, could become relevant for
the next U.S. administration because the two sides have agreed to
hold talks under the auspices of the United Nations.
   Turkey itself has stayed out of the ferment in the
Turkish-American community, unwilling to involve itself in internal
American politics.
   ``All we can hope is that Dukakis will be an even-handed
president, a president of all Americans, not just of the Greeks,''
said Daryal Batibay, the no. 2 diplomat at the Turkish Embassy.

   A U.S. military court found an
American serviceman guilty of murdering his wife and throwing her
body into shark-infested waters.
   Petty Officer Charles Wayne Elmore, 27, of Texas, was convicted
by court-martial Saturday of murdering his Philippine wife, Bella
Fe, at Exmouth in northwestern Australia on March 16. Elmore's
hometown was not available.
   A military prosecutor said Elmore stabbed his wife at their home
after an argument over money. He then allegedly threw her body,
which has not been found, from a pier into the Indian Ocean.
   The serviceman, who faces a maximum sentence of life in prison,
was based at the U.S. military communications base in Exmouth.
   Elmore pleaded innocent to the murder, saying his wife
accidentally fell from the pier into the sea. He told the court he
did not report the incident for 30 hours because he was ashamed he
could not save the woman.

   A series of earthquakes rocked India and
nearby countries, churning up big waves in a Bangladesh river that
capsized three boats and left at least 26 people missing and feared
drowned, officials and news reports said Sunday.
   They said three people died in India during one of the series of
temblors Saturday that also rocked parts of Burma, Nepal, Pakistan
and Afghanistan.
   The quakes injured 50 people in Dhaka, the capital of
Bangladesh, news reports said.
   Pakistani and Nepalese officials said no deaths were reported in
their countries. There was no immediate reports of injuries from
Burma and Afghanistan.
   The Press Trust of India reported that northeastern Assam state
was one of the areas hardest-hit by an earthquake whose epicenter
was close to the India-Burma border. The quake measured 7.3 on the
Richter scale.
   The ews agency said two people were killed and 12 injured when
buildings collapsed in Assam. The third person died in a traffic
accident blamed on the quake.
   The tremors cracked walls, caused other property damage and
triggered landslides in areas of Assam and neighboring Manipur
state.
   In Bangladesh, three boats carrying nearly 200 people capsized
Saturday when another quake churned up big waves in the Jamuna
River near Manikganj, 40 miles west of Dhaka, police said.
   Most passengers swam to safety, according to police in
Manikganj, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Only two bodies were recovered by Sunday afternoon but more than
two dozen people were missing and feared dead, the police said.
   Seismologists in Dhaka measured that quake at 5.2 on the Richter
scale.
   Among the 50 people injured by the tremors in Dhaka were six
students who fractured their legs when they jumped from
second-story windows in their dormitories at Dhaka University, news
reports said.
   A tremor with a Richter scale reading of 6.3 rocked parts of
Pakistan and Nepal Saturday, officials reported. Its epicenter was
in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground movement recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage, one
of 6 can cause severe damage, and one of 7 is capable of
widespread, heavy damage.

<HEAD>Search Continues For Three Of Five Jail Escapees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS LUNAS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police searched Sunday for three inmates
described as armed and dangerous who were among five men who
escaped from a county jail by punching a hole in a concrete roof
with a 5-pound chunk of steel plate.
   Two escapees from the Valencia County Jail were recaptured
without incident Saturday while walking along a road.
   Officers raided a house in Belen, near Los Lunas and about 30
miles south of Albuquerque, late Saturday where the three escapees,
all Mexican nationals, were believed to have been hiding, Sheriff
Lawrence Romero said.
   The three apparently had fled minutes earlier and were believed
headed for Mexico, Romero said. A state police roadblock set up on
Interstate 25 near Socorro was taken down early Sunday.
   Romero said police had reason to believe the escapees stole a
pickup that contained a .30-30-caliber rifle, a .22-caliber pistol
and a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle.
   The five inmates got out early Saturday by using a piece of
steel to chisel a hole through a 4-inch-thick roof, Romero said.
The steel piece was about 2 feet long, 4 inches wide and
three-quarters of an inch thick.
   ``It's pretty rotten concrete, so it probably wasn't too hard to
chisel through,'' said acting chief jailer Larry Askew.
   The hole was made in the roof of a small room housing water
pipes and valves next to the cellblock showers, he said. Inmates
have access to the pipe room to turn on the showers, and the room
is secured with a small iron door.
   Askew said it probably took several days to cut the hole, and
that guards did not routinely check the pipe room. Noise of the
digging could be covered by radios and televisions, he said.
   The escape was reported to the sheriff's department at 8:45
a.m., but probably took place at about 2:30 a.m., Romero said.
   The escapees apparently were being held in one cell, he said.
Hourly bed checks were made but the escapees apparently fooled
guards by putting rolled-up blankets in their beds to make it look
like someone was there, Askew said.
   ``How can you tell me they made their checks and not know
they're missing?'' Romero said. ``Are they saying they're making
their checks but not very well?''
   Arrested Saturday in southern Albuquerque were Damien Gonzales,
21, of Los Lunas, and Tommy Cordova, 19, of Albuquerque, said
sheriff's detective Mark Esparsen.
   A search continued Sunday for Eleno Avila, 24, Cruz Pacheco, 24,
and Jesus Campana, 24, all of Mexico.
   Romero said Avila was being held on charges of aggravated
assault with a motor vehicle, reckless driving and eluding a police
officer; Gonzales was being held on charges of aggravated assault,
battery and criminal damage to property; Cordova was being held on
charges of residential burglary and contributing to the delinquency
of a minor; and Pacheco and Campana were federal prisoners.
   Romero said he did not have the charges against Pacheco and
Campana.

   Leaders of the banned Solidarity trade
union federation on Sunday urged Polish factory workers to
celebrate the eighth anniversary of the organization.
   The union's National Executive Commission said in a statement
that the Aug. 31 anniversary ``should become an occasion for
remembering workers' rights.''
   It said deteriorating conditions in the workplace and declining
morale over economic recovery justified increased demands for
change.
   ``Growing tension over the last weeks in the coal and copper
mining industries prove that forgetting about social accords ...
inevitably creates conflicts,'' the statement said, referring to
workers in the Rudna copper mine in northern Silesia, who have
accused management of ignoring worker safety.
   The miners gave officials until Aug. 15 to improve working
conditions and threatened to stage a series of protest actions if
their demands aren't met.
   The Solidarity statement called on workers to draw up lists of
wage and safety demands and to press for the restoration of the
group's legal status.
   Solidarity was banned in 1981 after martial law was declared.
   The government accused Solidarity of engaging in anti-government
activity.
   Solidarity's main demand is that the state recognize trade union
pluralism, saying that official government unions do not adequately
represent workers' interests.
   Solidarity has encouraged factory workers to apply for legal
recognition. So far, courts have denied all of the more than two
dozen requests.
   In the port city of Gdansk, hundreds of Solidarity supporters
Sunday held a peaceful rally, an opposition spokesman said.
   The crowd assembled at St. Brygida's church, a Solidarity
gathering point several blocks from the Lenin shipyard, the
spokesman said. The shipyard, where the union was born in August
1980, was in May the center of an eight-day Solidarity-sponsored
strike.
   The demonstrators waved banners and shouted ``Solidarity!'' as
they marched toward the city's train station, said the opposition
spokesman, who refused to give his name. He said police watched but
did not intervene.

   Rescuers have found 311 people who were missing
and presumed dead after flash floods and heavy rains ravaged a
province on the Chinese coast, a newspaper reported.
   A total of 264 people were confirmed dead and 50 were still
missing from floods that hit Zhejiang province July 29-30, the
Xinmin Evening News said Saturday.
   It did not say how or where the 311 survivors were found.
   The floods came after about 18 inches of rain fell within six
hours in parts of five counties near Ningbo, a city on the East
China Sea, according to Qiu Weikang, a Ningbo city official.
   The Evening News said the rains and flooding destroyed 27,000
houses and 944 schools. More than 52,000 people were moved to
temporary shelters.
   The report said 40 million acres were flooded.
   The economic loss was estimated at more than $162 million, the
paper said, and residents say it was the worst rainfall in the area
in 100 years.
   On Saturday, floods inundated Fenyang county in northern Shanxi
province. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that at least 21
people died and 19 were missing after rain fell for more than three
hours.
   More than 800 people have died in floods this year in coastal,
southern and northern China. Another 500 were killed by a heat wave
in cities in the Yangtze River valley.

<TEXT>
   A feud between two families that boiled
over into a gun battle, killing three brothers and wounding three
other people, apparently began over car lights shining into one of
their homes, police said.
   The Saturday shootout across a dirt road between the Collins and
Johnson families involved about 15 people on the Johnson side
against four Collins brothers and their wives, said Diana Collins,
widow of one of those killed.
   Ramone Salinas, a friend of the Collins family, was charged with
resisting arrest, but no other charges had been filed by Sunday in
the gunfight, which took place in a rural area near this Florida
Panhandle community. She was freed on bond.
   ``We're just trying to put the facts together at this time to
determine what was homicide and what was self-defense,'' said Capt.
John Dennis, chief of the investigative unit of the Jackson County
sheriff's department.
   Police met Sunday afternoon to discuss the investigation.
``We're still involved in the investigation and there is nothing
else we can release at this time,'' Dennis said.
   Rifles, shotguns and pistols were used in the gun battle, Dennis
said, but he refused to give further details.
   The Johnson family has lived in the farming area for many years,
and the Collins family moved in across the road two years ago. The
Collinses live in three trailers, the Johnsons in a house.
   Marsha Collins, widow of one of the slain brothers, said outside
her home Sunday that the three dead men left behind a total of 15
children under the age of 12, and demanded action against the
Johnsons.
   ``There will be a battle, but it will be in court,'' Mrs.
Collins said. ``We won't stop until they are in jail.''
   There was no comment from the Johnsons, who had left their home
Sunday.
   Sheriff Johnny McDaniel blamed the feud in part on lights from
the Collinses' vehicles shining into the Johnson home as they drove
out at night.
   ``When they complained, they (the Collinses) got so that they
would sit and just shine their lights into the house,'' McDaniel
said.
   Another dispute began when social workers were notified that
some of the Collins children were living in a 42-foot
tractor-trailer parked on the Collins property, the sheriff said.
``They blamed the Johnsons with (reporting) it,'' he said.
   The incident that sparked the shooting, Marsha Collins said,
began Friday night when her husband was testing the motor of a
truck he had fixed, and the Johnsons called police to complain
about the noise.
   Deputies separated the families and sent them back to their
homes, Dennis said.
   Marsha Collins claimed that when the deputies left, the
Johnsons' aimed spotlights in the Collins' windows. The Collins
brothers then went to the street and were confronted by the
Johnsons, she said.
   The Collins brothers only got off one or two shots, she said.
   ``If it wasn't a setup, I don't know what is,'' Marsha Collins
said.
   Marsha Collins blamed a Johnson who she said lives with a niece
of the Collins brothers for starting the shooting.
   Around 2:15 a.m. Saturday, the sheriff's department received a
second call from the Johnson family, Dennis said.
   ``We got troubles,'' the caller told the dispatcher.
   Deputy Mike Lanier said that although the Johnsons are black and
the Collinses are white, he didn't believe the gunfight was
racially motivated.
   ``We've talked with all of them and both families said there was
no racial problem,'' said Dennis.
   Marsha Collins agreed: ``This is not racial. We have no problems
with black people.''
   Deputies answering the second call found Madison Collins, 32,
Marsha Collins' husband, and Herman Collins, 34, dead in the road.
A third brother, Lawrence Collins, 36, died while being taken to
Jackson County Hospital, authorities said. All three were truckers.
   Laughton Collins, 44, Carolyn Collins, 36, and Robert Johnson
Jr., 32, were wounded, officials said. They were listed in stable
condition Sunday.

   Twelve islands, complete with a country house and
9,000-acre sheep farm, have just gone on sale for $67,600. But the
buyer will have to like solitude.
   The Swan Islands are in the remote South Atlantic British colony
of the Falkland Islands _ off southern Argentina _ and are about
100 miles from the colonial capital of Stanley.
   Included in the price are the three-bedroom farmhouse and 2,900
sheep.
   ``The farm is a real bargain,'' said Ray Burke, assistant
managing director of the Falkland Islands Co. in London, which is
handling the sale.
   But ``you've got to like your own company out there,'' he said
Sunday. ``You definitely need a boat, because the nearest neighbor
is about 30 miles away.''
   Burke said there are a few shops in Stanley, but ``unless you
have a helicopter, you won't get over there much.''
   But it does have its advantages. ``The penguins come for
nothing,'' Burke said.
   The name of the seller was not made public.

   One of Belgium's best acrobatic air
force pilots was killed when his French Mirage V fighter jet
crashed during an air show Sunday, the Belgian air force reported.
   Major Michel Duvivier, 38, activated his ejection seat before
his plane crashed, but it was too late, the Air Force said. The air
show was in Hechtel, 58 miles northeast of the capital, Brussels.
   Duvivier was one of the air force's top test pilots and
regularly took part in air shows abroad, officials said.
   According to the Belgian news agency Belga, this was the 41st
Mirage V lost by the air force since it acquired 106 of them in
1971.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein pledged Sunday that his
government will fully recognize a Palestinian government-in-exile
if one is formed.
   ``Yes, I would recognize it immediately,'' he told foreign
reporters without hesitation just over a week after he began
severing links with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has been considering
forming a government-in-exile to fill the vacuum left by Hussein's
moves, but no decision has been announced.
   Jordan has maintained heavy ties with the West Bank, even though
the Israelis seized it from Jordanian control in the 1967 Middle
East War.
   However, the king has scrapped a $1.3-billion development plan
for Israeli-occupied territories, laid off or retired 21,200
Jordanian employees there and shut the separate ministry for
territorial affairs in his government.
   He said Sunday the option of annulling these measures ``does not
exist.''
   It is not clear how Hussein's moves may affect the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
violence, which began in December, has killed at least 237 Arabs
and four Israelis.
   Some Palestinians and others have suggested that Hussein's new
policy is designed to pressure the PLO to make good on its claims
of Palestinian leadership. If the PLO fails, the argument goes,
Jordan might be ready to step back in.
   Asked if he would take drastic measures, such as closing the PLO
misssion in Amman, the monarch said he hoped to see ``the PLO
offices enjoy the diplomatic status like other missions ... like an
embassy.''
   The king's comment may have been aimed at encouraging a
PLO-sponsored government-in-exile.
   In Israel Sunday, U.S. envoy Richard Murphy indicated the United
States had not abandoned hope that Hussein would play an important
role in the peace process.
   ``Jordan has been and will remain a strategic anchor for peace
in the region,'' Murphy told reporters. ``(Hussein's) interest is
in peace, and I assume his actions were taken toward that goal.''
   U.S. policy under the Reagan administration has relied heavily
on Jordan as a stand-in for the PLO. Murphy was scheduled to travel
to Jordan on Monday.
   Despite the latest moves, the king pledged to give full rights
to Jordanians of Palestinian origin and recognize Jordanian
passports held by residents of the occupied territories. He said
both bridges linking his country to the West Bank would remain open.
   A senior PLO official, who spoke Saturday on condition of
anonymity, said a high-level PLO delegation was due to visit Jordan
on Thursday. He said the delegation would hold talks with Jordanian
officials on the ``implications of King Hussein's latest measures
on the future of Palestinians.''

<HEAD>Ballerina Dances With the Kirov 18 Years After Defection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen years after she defected from the Soviet
Union, ballerina Natalia Makarova danced again with Leningrad's
Kirov Ballet _ an event she called ``emotional ecstasy.''
   With special permission from Moscow, Miss Makarova, 47, rejoined
her former company Saturday during its London visit to dance one
performance of the pas de deux from Act II of ``Swan Lake.''
   As she took her bow, many in the audience stood, clapping and
shouting, ``Bravo!''
   ``I wait for that moment for 18 years,'' Miss Makarova said in
an interview broadcast minutes before her performance was televised
live by the British Broadcasting Corp. She would have liked to
rejoin the Kirov, she said, if only she was younger.
   After the performance, the ballerina said: ``I was so nervous, I
was shaking, shaking like I have never done before. ... It has been
a very emotional evening _ now I will have a glass of champagne.''
   Miss Makarova defected in September 1970 during the Kirov's last
visit to London, saying she wanted greater artistic freedom and
opportunity.
   She spent hours rehearsing with the company last week and found
the Kirov had new influences and more freedom.
   When she was asked if it was a pleasure to dance with the Kirov
again, Miss Makarova replied: ``It's not the right word, just
pleasure _ it's emotional ecstasy.''
   ``I love the art of ballet, I love my theater, I love Russia and
I love people, and I don't understand why I cannot talk with them,
why I cannot be with them all these years,'' she said.
   ``I think now it is changed. I will go see my mother. My mother
will see my son. ... Any human can understand this moment for me is
very important.
   ``One company has been in my heart all these years, and I never
lose spiritual contact with them. It is the most happy moment in my
life,'' she said. ``It fulfills my own soul.''

<HEAD>More Than 400 Hindu Pilgrims Missing In Ganges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials said Sunday they had given up hope
of finding survivors among more than 400 Hindu pilgrims missing
after an overcrowded ferry capsized in the rain-swollen Ganges
River.
   Authorities said there were 100 known survivors from the
Saturday accident. They said 12 bodies had been recovered. But news
reports said Saturday that 38 had been found.
   Officials said the actual death toll may never be known.
   The ferry, carrying more than 500 passengers, capsized at 10:30
a.m. near Katihar, about 650 miles east of New Delhi and 180 miles
from Patna, the capital of Bihar province.
   There were conflicting reports on the cause of the disaster.
First reports said the steam-powered vessel rammed a sand bar while
attempting a curve in the churning river. It overturned about 100
yards from shore and the survivors swam to safety, said Katihar
police inspector N. Kunar.
   State-run Indian television said the two-deck ferry also carried
several vehicles and about 150 bags of wheat, and survivors said
they had protested when the wheat was brought aboard the already
overloaded vessel.
   Soon after leaving the jetty the ferry began to tilt and then
capsized, according to the television report.
   Passengers on the upper deck were tossed into the fast-moving
water, while those on the lower deck were trapped inside, Kunar
said.
   About 100 people gathered on the jetty Sunday and along the
marshy river banks in hopes the bodies of relatives and friends
would be recovered.
   Mangan Chand, whose father and an uncle were on the ferry, said,
``I know they're dead. I am waiting for their bodies so that I can
cremate them.''
   There was more rain Sunday, raising the level of the river.
   ``You can't rescue a body in the river at this time of year
because of the strong current,'' said Mubarak Hussain, a member of
the state legislature.
   ``The ferry is always overcrowded because people have no other
way to cross the river,'' he said. The nearest bridge is about 65
miles away.
   Navy divers were sent from New Delhi and residents near the
river used their boats to help in the search effort, he said.
   Mangan Insane, another member of the legislature, said 565
people had purchased tickets for the 10-minute ride across the
river. Hussain said the ferry could safely carry about 250 people.
   Kerosene lanterns gleamed through the night as relatives of the
victims maintained their vigil. Vendors sold tea to the crowd that
included a few jetty workers and junior government officials.
   The jetty workers said the ferry had a crew of 15-20 men. They
said several policemen, who do not need tickets to ride the ferry,
also were aboard the vessel.
   They said the ferry often was overcrowded, and fights broke out
among passengers if the ferry's operators tried to limit the number
of people going aboard.
   Most of the passengers were Hindu pilgrims crossing the Ganges
to catch a train to Deoghar, where the Hindu shrines are visited by
thousands of pilgrims every day.
   The pilgrims were to carry huge pots of water to the shrines as
part of the worship of the Hindu god Shiva.
   The accident occurred during the monsoon season, when the Ganges
reaches a width of one mile near Katihar.

<HEAD>Report: British Warship Nearly Downed Cargo Plane In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Sunday that a British warship
came within 10 seconds of shooting down a civilian aircraft over
the Persian Gulf last year.
   The weekly Observer, quoting unidentified air traffic
controllers in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, reported that the
destroyer HMS Cardiff last year targeted surface-to-air missiles at
a cargo plane.
   The Ministry of Defense said it would not comment on the report,
and the Observer reported no comment from the Royal Navy.
   The article follows an inquiry by the United States into the
July 3 downing by the guided-missile cruiser USS Vincennes of an
Iran Air jetliner. The United States said Navy forces mistook the
jetliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter. All 290 people on board the
jet were killed.
   In Sunday's report, the Observer did not specify the date or
further identify the cargo plane. It said the alleged incident
never had been disclosed.
   Air traffic controllers quoted by the newspaper said the
incident showed the dangers of foreign warships operating in the
gulf, where Iran and Iraq have both attacked shipping in their
8-year-old war.
   The Cardiff was on routine escort duty when the cargo plane flew
over the ship by mistake, and the pilot was not linked to an
emergency military radio frequency that could have been used to
warn him, the newspaper quoted the controllers as saying.
   When the pilot did not respond to warnings from the ship, the
Observer said, ``preparations were made to shoot down the plane.
Anti-aircraft missiles were within 10 seconds of being launched
when a final check revealed the plane was not hostile.''
   The air traffic controllers also said a U.S. Navy warship once
ordered a British Airways flight to change course and nearly caused
it to crash into another aircraft.
   In Washington, Maj. Alan Freithe, the Pentagon's weekend duty
officer, refused comment on the report.
   The Dubai air traffic controllers said they ``swiftly
countermanded'' the order from the U.S. Navy ship and avoided a
collision between the two planes, the Observer reported.
   A Pentagon report blamed the July 3 incident on human error by
radar operators without combat experience, who wrongly informed
Capt. Will C. Rogers III that the airliner appeared to be an
attacking fighter, Defense Department officials said. The report
also blamed the accident on stress under combat with Iranian
gunboats.
   In an April 18 skirmish with Iranian gunboats, confusing radar
signals caused three other American warships to believe they were
under attack by non-existent Iranian missiles.

<HEAD>Rain Over Northeast And South, Hot On Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over New England, the
South and the northern Plains on Sunday, and record high
temperatures returned to the upper Midwest.
   Tropical storm Alberto was northeast of Cape Cod, Mass., and was
expected to move near Nova Scotia sometime Monday. Highest
sustained wind speed was 40 mph, with higher gusts near squalls.
The storm produced heavy rain over parts of eastern Maine, but it
was expected to mostly affect marine interests off the coast of New
England.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from central and
eastern New England south to the mid Atlantic Coast as a cold front
moved through New England.
   Low pressure over southeastern Louisiana scattered numerous
showers and thunderstorms along the central Gulf Coast into the
southern half of Alabama. Some storms produced locally heavy rain,
with 2.11 inches of rain in the 24 hours up to 7 a.m. at the New
Orleans Audubon zoo, with 2.05 inches at Thibodaux, La.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over much of eastern
and southern Florida, and extended from eastern Georgia into
southeastern Tennessee and over southeast Missouri.
   Melbourne, Fla., got 1.99 inches of rain in the six hours up to
2 p.m.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from northwestern and
north-central Minnesota into eastern South Dakota, developing along
a cold front that was pushing eastward into the upper Mississippi
Valley and southward into the central Plains.
   The cold front dragged cooler, drier air into the northern
Plains. Behind the front, northerly wind carried temperatures in
the 60s and 70s across the northern Rockies into the northern
Plains.
   Ahead of the front, temperatures were in the low to mid 90s from
southern Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin into the middle
Mississippi Valley, and near 100 from the lower Missouri Valley
into the central and southern Plains.
   Record highs Sunday were 99 at Des Moines, Iowa; 96 at La
Crosse, Wis.; 100 at Sioux City, Iowa; and 107 at Waco, Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 105 at Waco, Texas. The nation's low
Sunday morning was 34 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, widespread showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the upper Great Lakes through the lower Missouri Valley and
the central high Plains into the Colorado Rockies. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the southern Atlantic
Coast through the central Gulf Coast into Florida.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast and
across northeastern North Dakota through northern Minnesota; in the
mid 90s to 105 from the middle and lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas
into the southern Plains; between 100 and 110 over the desert
Southwest; and in the 80s to low 90s across much of the rest of the
nation.

   Prime Minister Yizhak Shamir warned U.S. envoy
Richard Murphy on Sunday against the United States making contacts
with the PLO and said it would lead to more violence in the
occupied territories.
   Murphy said ``it is certainly possible to have dialogue with the
PLO'' if they meet U.S. conditions. He was referring to American
demands that the Palestine Liberation Organzization abandon armed
struggle and recognize Israel.
   The U.S. envoy indicated that the United States still hoped
Jordan could play a part in reaching a Middle East peace
settlement, despite King Hussein's decision to sever ties with the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel's divided Cabinet engaged in heated debate about the
consequences of Jordan's moves. Both sides attacked a Palestinian
initiative to issue a ``declaration of independence'' proclaiming a
PLO-led state in the territories.
   Shamir said news of the document, which was seized Aug. 1, would
lead to greater Israeli unity. Shamir's political rival, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, dismissed it as ``one more paper to the
world.''
   Right-wing members called for annexation of some occupied
territory, while leftists criticized Shamir's lack of initiative on
peace negotiations.
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said the prime minister told
Murphy in a two-hour meeting that any U.S. moves toward contact
with the PLO could encourage violence in the occupied lands, where
237 Arabs and four Israelis have died since Dec. 8.
   ``The very fact of rumors or hints that the United States may
talk with the PLO can be encouragement (to violence), and weaken
moderate elements,'' Ahimeir said, paraphrasing Shamir's comments.
   Murphy, an assistant U.S. secretary of state, arrived in Israel
Saturday. ``We welcome dialogue with Palestinians, and it is
certainly possible to have dialogue with the PLO once they have met
our conditions,'' he said after meeting Peres.
   ``Israelis and Palestinians are currently facing a higher level
of tension and violence. This underscores the urgency of achieving
a political accommodation between the two peoples,'' Murphy said
after meeting Shamir.
   Later, he told reporters, ``Jordan has been and will remain a
strategic anchor for peace in the region...(Hussein's) interest is
in peace, and I assume his actions were taken toward that goal.''
Murphy travels to Jordan on Monday.
   U.S. policy under the Reagan administration has relied heavily
on Jordan as a stand-in for the PLO. That policy was thrown into
question by Jordan's decision to sever administrative and legal
ties to the West Bank, which it lost to Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   In Jordan, King Hussein told reporters he would immediately
recognize a Palestinian government-in-exile if it were formed.
   The Cabinet devoted much of its four-hour weekly session Sunday
to Hussein's moves, which were designed to give the PLO greater
responsibility in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
reportedly clashed with Peres of the center-left Labor Party when
he suggested annexation of some occupied territory.
   Shamir was quoted by the London-based Observer newspaper Sunday
as rejecting demands from right-wing colleagues and supporters to
annex occupied territory, saying it would violate the 1978 Camp
David accord.
   The accord envisages an interim period of Palestinian autonomy
followed by negotiations for a final settlement.
   The Israeli Cabinet also discussed the draft declaration of
independence proposed by local Palestinian leaders.
   Without taking a formal vote, the ministers agreed that ``this
is something which is never going to happen, no one is going to
give it a second look,'' said Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot on Sunday published what it said was a
draft declaration of independence signed by 152 Palestinians.
   The declaration called for a state based on a 1947 U.N.
partition plan, which would encompass much of Israel's northern
Galilee and Arab east Jerusalem as well as the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   A different draft obtained by The Associated Press made no
mention of 1947 borders, calling for a state in the West Bank and
Gaza with Arab east Jerusalem as its capital.
   Palestinian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the 10-page draft had been forwarded to the PLO for approval. Both
draft versions said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat would be president
of a government-in-exile.
   Shamir told Israel television that since most Israelis opposed a
Palestinian state, ``the very presentation of the document should
bring about greater unity in Israel.''
   Peres dismissed the declaration as ``adding one more paper to
the world. No one can dictate to anyone else. If there will be
movement in the Middle East, it will either be by war...or
negotiations.''
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO Al Fajr newspaper,
supported the document, saying it ``would positively affect the
situation.''

<HEAD>$3 Billion Buy Another Murdoch Special</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-TV Guide Sale, Bjt.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is it a conflict of interest to own seven
television stations and TV Guide? Rupert Murdoch is about to find
out.
   But his $3 billion agreement to buy the weekly magazine,
Seventeen magazine and the Daily Racing Form is just the latest
deal by a man with media holdings on three continents, a dozen
newspapers, a half-dozen magazines and two publishing houses.
   Murdoch was known internationally before making his move into
the United States. Starting in Australia in the 1950s, he began
assembling his media empire there and in Britain, eventually
acquiring $2.2 billion in holdings.
   He assumed ownership of his father's paper, the tiny Adelaide
News, and built from there. His wife, Anna Murdoch, met him while
working as a reporter at one of his Australian papers.
   In 1969, he purchased The Sun, a London-based tabloid, and
showed Britain the Murdoch method of running a newspaper. In
addition to sensationalist stories, Murdoch added daily photos of
topless women. Circulation soared from 950,000 to 4 million.Later
he took over the staid London Sunday Times.
   Murdoch's early U.S. acquisitions included the San Antonio
Express and News, a daily newspaper, and the National Star, a
weekly gossip magazine. He owned both when he paid $30 million for
the New York Post in 1976.
   Once again his style became quickly evident: conservative
editorial stance, screaming headlines, outrageous stories. Although
the Post became a severe financial drain, its circulation increased
under Murdoch.
   And while he lost millions at the Post, the rest of his empire
flourished: profits for the News Corporation Ltd., his worldwide
company, were 32 times higher when Murdoch sold the paper than when
he bought it.
   While running the Post, Murdoch also purchased the Village
Voice, which he has since sold, and New York Magazine; his
aggressive posture earned him Adweek's 1982 Publisher of the Year
award.
   In February, Murdoch sold the Post to real estate developer
Peter Kalikow.
   Murdoch moved to Manhattan during the mid-1970s. In 1985, he
became an American citizen and began buying television stations.
   But an enemy made with his stance at the Post came back to haunt
him. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced legislation setting
an imminent deadline for Murdoch to end his dual ownership of
newspapers and television stations in Boston and New York.
   Kennedy, during his presidential run in 1980, was hammered
repeatedly by the Post in its coverage. Murdoch papers also
delighted in running photos of an overweight Kennedy with headlines
like ``Tubby Teddy.''
   Murdoch also developed a reputation as a ruthless handler of
unions. His decision to automate the printing process at British
newspapers infuriated labor leaders there, but Murdoch is not
bothered by that.
   ``You seldom achieve big things in life without making some
enemies on the way,'' Murdoch said in an interview earlier this
year.
   Murdoch still owns the San Antonio paper; his other U.S.
newspaper holding is the Boston Herald. His efforts these days are
focused on converting Fox Broadcasting into the nation's fourth
commercial network.
   Murdoch has promised to keep looking for new deals.
   ``Now you're going to see joint ventures and start-ups _ new
newspapers, magazines and television services,'' Murdoch promised
five months before swinging the $3 billion deal with Triangle
Publications Inc.

<HEAD>Police Commander Says Presidential Candidate Should Run As
Civilian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the national police said
in an interview published Sunday that the candidate in the
presidential referendum should run as a civilian and not as a
military officer.
   ``The new president is going to be a civilian,'' Gen. Rodolfo
Stange told the newspaper El Mercurio.
   He was asked if he meant that if the nominee is a military
officer he should retire from the armed forces and he replied
``Yes.''
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the army commander who has ruled Chile
since leading the bloody coup in September 1973 that ousted the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende, is
expected to be the only nominee.
   Stange and the heads of the three military branches _ Pinochet,
navy commander Jose Merino and air force chief Fernando Matthei _
are scheduled to determine on Aug. 30 who the nominee will be.
Merino and Matthei also have publicly said the candidate should run
as a civilian.
   After the Aug. 30 nominating meeting the commanders will
announce a specific date for the referendum that is expected to be
held in early October.
   If a majority of voters approve of the nominee he will begin an
eight-year presidential term next March. If the nominee is rejected
by most voters an open election will be held in 1990, with Pinochet
remaining in office until then.
   Pinochet's central source of authority in nearly 15 years of
rule has been his command of the army, the largest and most
powerful military branch.

   A U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier
and nine other warships steamed into the Arabian Sea to replace
other U.S. vessels in helping to protect Persian Gulf oil
shipments, the U.S. Navy said Sunday.
   However, the Navy said the changes were routine and unrelated to
diplomatic efforts to establish a truce in the 8-year-old Persian
Gulf war. They left the level of U.S. forces in the region
essentially unchanged, said a Navy official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The 91,487-ton carrier Carl M. Vinson and its battle group, all
based on the U.S. West Coast, replaced an East Coast contingent
headed by the carrier Forrestal. That group was in the region since
mid-May.
   The Navy has kept a carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea for
the past year to provide air support for the warships escorting
U.S.-flagged tankers inside the Persian Gulf. Pentagon officials
have said that the United States will reduce its 27-ship force in
the gulf region if and when a cease-fire in the war between Iran
and Iraq goes into effect.
   Arriving with the Carl M. Vinson were the nuclear-powered
cruiser Texas, the missile destroyers Robison and Goldsborough, the
frigate Fanning, the oilers Roanoke and Passumpsic, the ammunition
ship Flint and the Niagara Falls, a supply ship.
   The Forrestal and its escorts were en route back to the United
States. The group included the destroyer Spruance, missile
destroyers Dahlgren and Semmes, frigates Pharris and Elmer
Montgomery, the oiler Milwaukee and the ammunition ship Suribachi.
   The missile cruiser Vincennes, which pulled out of the gulf two
weeks ago, is continuing to operate in the Arabian Sea, military
officials said. The Vincennes shot down an Iranian commercial
airliner, killing all 290 people aboard, on July 3. The Navy said
the warship mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter.

   The nation's governors agreed privately to
keep presidential politics from dominating their annual meeting, at
which President Reagan and Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis plan to make separate appearances, a source said
Sunday.
   Also Sunday, a White House official told the governors that
``state governments are now the center of activism.''
   Frank J. Donatelli, chief White House liaison to the governors,
said that President Reagan's goal throughout his presidency has
been ``diminishing federal intrusion into state affairs.''
   Before the start of the annual meeting of the National Governors
Association, Republican Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, NGA
chairman, and Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, who will
be the next chairman, agreed the state executives ought to avoid
presidential politics.
   A source familiar with the discussions, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sununu and Baliles then urged their fellow
governors to avoid discussion of the campaign.
   The governors were meeting between the national political
conventions that selected Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts,
as the Democratic presidential nominee and that will designate Vice
President George Bush as the Republican candidate next week.
   Dukakis planned to attend the closing session of the NGA meeting
Tuesday and also meet with Democratic governors. Bush had no plans
to attend the meeting, but Reagan was flying to the session Monday
to address the governors.
   At a news conference opening the NGA meeting on Saturday,
Sununu, a strong backer of Bush and frequent critic of Dukakis,
steadfastly refused to talk about the campaign. He said he would
``display tremendous discipline'' in an effort to steer clear of
presidential politics.
   Despite the agreement to steer clear of partisan politics,
Republican Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois described Dukakis' views
on foreign policy as ``naive at best.''
   Sununu and Thompson are among three governors mentioned as
potential choices for the GOP vice presidential nomination. The
other is Carroll Campbell of South Carolina.
   Donatelli said that as a result of Reagan's push to give more
responsibility to the states, ``state governments are now the
center of activism; they make things happen.''
   Donatelli said that ``through economic growth, block grants and
tax reform and especially regulatory reform, President Reagan has
persisted in his efforts to decentralize government.''
   There was bipartisan agreement that Reagan had won the fight
with the governors over transfer of domestic programs to the states.
   Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, a Democrat, noted that in the
early years of Reagan's presidency there was ``bipartisan
resistance'' to his proposals to shift responsibility for domestic
programs to the states.
   ``Yet, here we are, seven and one-half years later, not too far
from perhaps where the president first thought we ought to be,''
said Celeste, the host governor for the 80th annual meeting of the
NGA.
   The first formal sessions of the conference dealt with reports
on education and rural development.
   Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, chairman of the NGA subcommittee
on education, said his panel found ``an amazing number and variety
of initiatives'' launched in states to improve education.
   Cited were programs to improve teacher training and recruitment,
make greater use of communications technology, and provide health
and educational services to poor children.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, chairman of the Rural Development Task
Force, told a hearing, ``The time has come for a new national
commitment to revitalize rural America.''
   The report issued by the task force called for giving
communities greater say in the design of aid programs.
   Branstad said the farm economy had been improving but was now in
a new crisis because of the prolonged drought.
   ``The full impact of the drought in rural America remains to be
seen,'' said Branstad. He said the drought already had brought ``a
return of anxieties'' to many rural communities.
   The record federal budget deficits have been a dominant topic at
governors conferences throughout the Reagan presidency.
   ``At the very time that states governments have suffered
significant reductions in federal funds, the federal deficit itself
has increased,'' said Baliles.
   ``If the federal government doesn't have the money to spend, who
will carry out the functions that have traditionally been carried
on at the federal level?'' asked Baliles.
   He said it was essential to debate ``the nature of the power
relationship that exists between the different levels of
government.''
   Celeste said the shift of responsibility for many domestic
programs had not occurred in a systematic way ``but there is no
question, it seems to me, that we are, as state governments, in a
position where we have assumed a much larger responsibility.''

<HEAD>Federal Rule Imposed After Gandhi Party Members Bolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities took control of a
northeastern state on Sunday, news agencies said, after defections
from Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's governing party threw the region
into a political crisis.
   The agencies also said the state legislature of Nagaland, a
region on the Chinese border that has seen years of tribal
rebellion, was dissolved.
   A federal official in New Delhi, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that when 13 Nagaland legislators, including four
ministers, resigned from the Congress Party last week, they caused
``instability in a vital northeastern state which has a history of
insurgency.''
   Gandhi's Congress Party won 31 seats in the 60-member state
legislature in November elections. However, the defectors said the
state government had failed to live up to popular expectations and
joined efforts to form a new party.
   Their departure reduced the party to minority status.
   Tribal Naga rebels had demanded secession from India, but many
participated in the November elections.
   Federal rule will extend for six months to give time for new
legislative elections.
   Nagaland is the third Indian state to come under federal
control. The others are the northern state of Punjab, where radical
Sikhs are demanding a homeland, and politically unsettled Tamil
Nadu in the south.

<HEAD>Two Charged In Scheme To Sell Food From School Lunch Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two government employees were
charged Sunday with embezzling thousands of dollars from school
lunch programs by allegedly reporting food had spoiled and then
selling it to private firms.
   Justice Department officials said the charges, filed after a
two-year investigation, involve hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of food that was marked as rotten and then sold to
wholesalers and stores instead of destroying it, the San Juan Star
reported.
   It said most of the food was surplus produce donated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which gave $17 million worth of goods to
Puerto Rico's Education Department last year.
   Juan E. Berrios, director of the School Lunchroom Storage and
Distribution Service, was charged with seven counts of theft
involving more than $50,000 worth of sugar, canned fruit, rice,
corned beef, canned salmon, cereal, dehydrated potatoes and cheese.
   Olga Arroyo Medina, a Health Department inspector from the town
of Dorado, was charged with eight counts of failing her duties as a
public servant by not ensuring the food was destroyed after it had
been marked as unsuitable.
   That is a misdemeanor and she was not present as the charges
were presented at the Superior Court in the suburb of Bayamon.
   The charges against Berrios involve felonies and the judge set
his bail at $14,000. Berrios was released later Sunday after
posting bail.
   A preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 24.
   Although the food involved in the charges was from an Education
Department warehouse in Vega Alta, 10 miles west of San Juan,
officials said the same procedure was carried out at other
warehouses.
   Two other former government workers _ the Vega Alta warehouse
director and an employee _ were arrested on theft charges in
February and pleaded guilty.
   A wholesaler Berrios allegedly sold food to also was arrested
but was given immunity from prosecution after he agreed to turn
state's witness.
   Berrios, a native of the town of Cidra who faces felony charges,
was released after posting bail set at $14,000.

   About 12,000 anti-military protesters formed a

   A police official said there were no reports of clashes between
police and the demonstrators in the city of Komatsu, 190 miles
northwest of Tokyo. He said he had no other details.
   Kyodo News Service said the demonstration was sponsored by

   It said the Komatsu base is the only one on the Sea of Japan
that has combat air units. The news service said the base accounts
for about 20 percent of Japanese military flights.

<TEXT>
   The penny parking meters in this
affluent community are going the way of penny candy, and the
township's parking attendant says it's about time.
   ``Pennies are out,'' says Sylvia Davis, who has been the parking
violations officer for 15 years. ``You can't get anything with a
penny anymore.''
   The 162 penny meters, installed in the 1950s on seven streets in
the community of 15,700 near Philadelphia, will be replaced by
mid-August.
   Parking rates will rise from 1 cent to 5 cents for 12 minutes
and from a nickel to a quarter per hour.
   Beginning Monday, minimum parking fines will rise from $3 to $6.
   Mrs. Davis says she has spent a lot of time repairing the old
meters with her handy screwdriver.
   ``We can't get any parts for them,'' she says. ``They're
outdated.''
   The township agreed, and last month earmarked $34,200 to buy new
parking meters, says John M. Schoenberg, deputy township manager
and director of finance.
   Schoenberg said about a quarter of the old ones could no longer
be repaired. The township spent about $19,000 annually to maintain
them, but they only generated about $6,000, he said.
   The new meters will generate between $22,000 and $25,000 he said.
   Bill Phillips, production manager at Meter Products in Lodi,
N.J., estimated that three other towns in New Jersey and 10 in the
Northeast still have penny meters.
   Mrs. Davis, who issues about 40 meter violation tickets a day,
says the new meters will be easier to operate and drivers won't
have to scramble to find pennies.
   ``A lot of times, they can't find pennies,'' she said. ``A lot
of times they put dimes in and they don't take them.''
   Mrs. Davis says residents don't seem too upset by the meter
change.
   ``They're more interested about buying the (old) meters,'' she
says.
   Schoenberg says the township plans to sell the old ones to
residents and antique dealers, and that a working meter could go
for as much as $45.
   ``Everytime I talk to somebody the price gets a little higher,''
he says.

<TEXT>
   Assailants on Sunday shot and wounded the
traditional leader of an occupied West Bank Palestinian village, a
hospital official said. A Jewish settlement leader said the wounded
man collaborated with Israel.
   Mustafa Abu Bakr, 47, the village leader, or mukhtar, of Bidya,
was hit in the stomach four times and taken to Meir Hospital in
Kfar Saba, said the hospital's deputy director, Dr. Avinoam
Eliashiv.
   Bidya is 25 miles north of Jerusalem.
   Military sources said Abu Bakr was sitting outside his home with
his children when assailants opened fire from 15 yards away. One of
his sons was slightly wounded in the hand, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Israel Television said Abu Bakr probably was shot by
Palestinians. Israel radio reported that the gunman fired a
Soviet-designed submachine gun.
   The army command said it was investigating the report.
   Ron Nahman, mayor of the nearby Jewish settlement of Ariel, said
Mustafa had collaborated with Israel.
   He also said it was the second attempt on Abu Bakr's life since
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip broke out eight months ago. According to U.N.
figures, 237 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in the
uprising.
   ``In April, Arabs tried to blow up his home along with his wife
and seven children,'' Nachman said in a telephone interview. ``They
put six gas balloons alongside the wall of his house and lit them.''
   Nachman said Abu Bakr fired at his assailants before Israeli
troops and Jews from nearby settlements rescued him.
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising have issued
several leaflets calling for the assassination of Arabs who
continue to collaborate with Israel.
   On Feb. 24, Palestinians from the village of Qabatiye, near
Jenin, lynched an alleged collaborator.
   Two weeks later, a Palestinian policeman working for the
military government was stabbed to death in the Aqbat Jaber refugee
camp near Jericho.
   Other alleged Palestinian collaborators have been forced to flee
their villages because Israeli authorities have been unable to
guarantee their safety.
   Nachman warned that Palestinians might try to assassinate more
Arabs. ``As the army hedges them in, they will try to intimidate
Arab collaborators,'' said Nachman. ``It will get worse and there
will be more assassinations.''

different from that of Ferdinand Marcos, deposed as president in
February 1986 in a civilian-military uprising that brought Mrs.
Aquino to power.
   ``I disagree very vehemently on this,'' she said. ``In the first
place, my predecessor engaged in wholesale graft and corruption. .
.. I challenge anybody to say that I have ill-gotten wealth.''
Marcos is living in exile in Hawaii.
   The Presidential Commission on Good Government has seized about
$300 million worth of assets that belonged to Marcos, his relatives
and associates. They have been accused by officials in Mrs.
Aquino's government of obtaining as much as $10 billion illegally
during Marcos' 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino's comments Sunday were in response to a newspaper
report that her brother-in-law, Ricardo Lopa, had gained control of
36 companies seized by the government from Benjamin Romualdez, a
brother of Marcos's wife Imelda, shortly after Marcos was ousted.
   Mrs. Aquino said her family owned 60 percent of the companies in
question but the firms were taken over by Marcos's relatives when
he imposed martial law in 1972. The businesses include shipping and
construction companies.
   In her radio address Mrs. Aquino said that shortly after she
became president she lost interest in acquiring the shares her
family had owned in the companies but Lopa wanted to buy back the
15 percent his family owned.
   She said Lopa's proposal to buy back his shares is still being
studied by the Presidential Commission on Good Government.
   ``I think my relatives can get into business without receiving
any special privilege, and you know I have been very strict on
this,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   It was the second time Mrs. Aguino has become involved in
allegations involving her relatives.
   Last year she ordered the National Bureau of Investigation to
investigate claims that a sister-in-law, Margarita Cojuangco, had
received $1 million from an Australian businessman in exchange for
a gambling concession.
   Mrs. Cojuangco denied the charge and eventually was cleared by
the bureau.

<HEAD>U.S. Episcopal Leader Calls for Progressive Anglican Churches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of U.S. Episcopal Church
on Sunday told Anglican bishops split over whether to allow women
bishops not to let their churches ``be a museum of the past.''
   The issue of consecrating the Anglicans' first woman bishop gave
rise to bitter disputes and an inconclusive compromise at the
three-week conference of bishops representing 70 million Anglicans
worldwide.
   The move is expected within a few months by one of seven
churches, including the U.S. Episcopal, which have ordained 1,200
women priests.
   Bishop Edmond L. Browning, who leads 2.5 million U.S.
Episcopalians, spoke at a service in 800-year-old Canterbury
Cathedral. It capped the often stormy Lambeth Conference, the 12th
such gathering since Anglican bishops first met in 1867.
   Without making a direct reference to the controversy over women
bishops, Browning called on bishops to move away from ways of the
past. However, he combined his appeal with a call for unity.
   ``To have unity, to have authority, the Anglican Communion must
not be a museum of the past but the household of faith for the
future,'' he said.
   The conference debates ended with leaders of the 27
self-governing churches, representing Anglicans in 164 countries,
expressing determination to remain united.
   In a compromise on the issue, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, who led the conference, was instructed to set up and head a
new commission to examine how the churches will maintain unity
despite divisions over women bishops.

<HEAD>British Government To Close Independent Broadcasting Authority</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government plans to scrap the private
broadcasting authority that regulates the country's commercial
television, The Sunday Times of London reported.
   The newspaper said that a government policy review due in
November would recommend replacing the Independent Broadcasting
Authority with an agency that can take more advantage of the
consumer choice offered by satellite and cable television.
   Britain has four broadcast television channels, all based on a
tradition that use of the airwaves is a public service accountable
to the people through the national government in Parliament.
   Two national channels are operated by the British Broadcasting
Corp., which is publicly funded by fees that television users pay
annually for the privilege of owning a set.
   The authority, created in 1955, regulates the other two channels
which offer a mixture of national and regional programming funded
primarily by advertising sales.
   Government ministers have concluded that the authority engaged
in anti-competitive practices by forming an advertising cartel that
pushed up the price of television ads 37 percent in the past two
years, despite falling viewership compared to the BBC, the
newspaper said.
   The authority has also been criticized for failing to control
program standards, the newspaper said. Mrs. Thatcher has warned the
authority to curb what she calls excessive sex and violence on
television.
   A particular irritant, the newspaper said, has been Channel 4,
introduced in 1982 to give Britons a wider choice of local
programming. The Sunday Times said the government perceives a
left-wing bias in the channel's current affairs programs.
   The Sunday Times quoted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose
Conservative Party government has promoted deregulation throughout
British industry, as calling the IBA ``the last bastion of
restrictive practices.''
   The authority's chairman, Lord Thomson, called the plan ``an act
of folly ... like throwing the baby out with the bathwater,'' the
newspaper said.
   Disbanding the authority would require the approval of
Parliament, where Mrs. Thatcher's party enjoys a 101-seat advantage
in the House of Commons.

   Leaders of the Republican platform committee
predicted Sunday there will be no separate sections outlining
minority views in the 1988 party platform, continuing a pattern
established in the Reagan campaign years of 1980 and 1984.
   Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, the chairwoman of the platform
committee, and Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, a co-chairman, also
said the committee's final public hearings this week will probably
encounter controversy on such issues as drug abuse, AIDS, rights of
the handicapped and child care.
   Kasten categorized the topics as ``newer issues ... not fully
covered'' in the 1980 and 1984 Republican platforms.
   Aside from those issues, Orr said, ``we don't see a major
departure'' from the 1984 platform, which she described as ``a good
foundation for us.''
   The 1984 GOP platform opposed any tax increases, contained no
support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and endorsed
proposed constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal
budget and giving the president power to veto specific items in
budget bills.
   The GOP platform committee has been gathering testimony around
the country for several months. The panel's seven subcommittees
will conclude hearings this week by drafting a platform for
presentation to the Republican National Convention during the
event's second night, Aug. 16.
   ``We will be able to come to a consensus,'' Orr said. She said
she also was making that forecast because members of the 106-person
platform committee have paid attention to the state Republican
platforms.
   Kasten said the final Republican document will be longer than
the 5,200-word platform adopted by the Democrats at their national
convention last month in Atlanta.
   The Democratic platform consisted of general principles. ``Our
platform will be very specific,'' Kasten said.
   Vice President George Bush, the all-but-nominated Republican
presidential candidate, will testify before the panel Monday. He is
expected to urge the committee to adopt a detailed, specific
platform.
   Other witnesses include conservative spokeswoman Phyllis
Schlafly; Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP; Molly
Yard, president of the National Organization for Women; Contra
leader Adolfo Calero; Dr. Edward Teller, the key developer of the
H-bomb and a leading designer of the Star Wars missile defense
system supported by the Reagan administration; an array of elected
officials from federal, state and local governments; and
representatives of various interest groups.

   Republican George Bush said Sunday
he will agree to ``more than one'' debate with Democrat Michael
Dukakis, but isn't ready to pin himself down on how many, when or
where.
   ``I'm ready to commit to debates,'' Bush said after attending
church with his family at this seacoast resort where he has a
summer home.
   He denied an accusation by the Dukakis campaign that he was
shying away from confronting his Democratic rival.
   ``Not only do I want debates, but I have to because I've got to
get him to stand by his record,'' the vice president said.``We've
got to spell these differences out and debates are a good way to do
it.''
   In the debates, Bush said, he would hammer home his contention
that Dukakis is soft on defense.
   ``We can't risk the peace and national security of this country
on someone as unexperienced as the governor of Massachusetts,'' the
vice president said.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said, however, that Bush
``is talking tough to the cameras but is refusing to meet Mike
Dukakis in a face-to face-debate.''
   ``If George Bush wants to debate foreign policy, Mike Dukakis is
ready,'' she said. ``The vice president's resume didn't help him
when it mattered. He sat silently by while the administration
peddled arms to the Ayatollah.''
   Bush also said he would tell Republican platform drafters on
Monday in New Orleans to ``be a little more specific than the
Democratic platform committee.''
   Bush will be the leadoff speaker before the GOP panel.
   It was to be a one-day trip. Bush was to return to New Orleans,
where he will be installed as the GOP presidential nominee, on Aug.
16.
   ``I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' Bush
said. ``The govenor of Massachusetts says he is a liberal, says he
is a card-carrying member of the ACLU (the American Civil Liberties
Union), and that didn't come out of the convention.
   ``They masked it. They cramped down any discussion of individual
initiatives. Mine will be somewhat more specific.''
   The vice president attended church with 22 members of his
family, who occupied the first two pews of St. Ann's Episcopal
Church.
   With him were his wife, Barbara, his 87-year-old mother, Dorothy
Walker Bush, his five adult children and their spouses, and his ten
grandchildren.
   ``We try to get together once every summer,'' Bush said. ``This
is that weekend.''
   The vice president and his family spent much at his oceanfront
home taping television commercials for the fall campaign.
   Speaking with reporters, Bush said he was not worried about
recent polls showing him trailing Dukakis by 17 or more points.
   He blamed the gap on what he suggested was an artifical boost
Dukakis got from the Democratic convention. ``They've had their day
in sun,'' he said. ``Now we will have our day.''
   He said that he would continue to press Dukakis on issues.
``It's not negative (campaigning),'' Bush said. ``It has to be
done. And once it's done, the polls will take care of themselves.''
   He accused Dukakis of ``flip flopping'' on a freeze on nuclear
weapons, of mismanaging the budget of Massachusetts and of seeking
to ``cut the muscle out of our strategic defense.''
   And, said Bush, ``He goes down to New Jersey and talks about the
pollution off New Jersey and look, over his shoulder is Boston
harbor, one of the most seriously polluted bodies of water in this
country.''
   Last week, Estrich and Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign
chairman, sent a letter to Bush campaign officials criticizing the
vice president for not agreeing to a series of three presidential
debates and one vice presidential debate proposed by a bipartisan
panel.
   ``There will be debates. And I look forward to them,'' Bush
said. ``But I'm not the nominee of our party yet and we have plenty
of time to determine how many, where and all of that.''
   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many...has not been
sorted out yet,'' he said.
   Appearing Sunday on NBC's ``Meet The Press,'' outgoing Treasury
secretary James A. Baker III, also declined to discuss how many
debates Bush would be willing to hold with Dukakis. Baker is
resigning to head Bush's campaign.
   Asked he he had made any progress in narrowing his list of
possible running mates, Bush said, ``not really.''
   However, he gave a flat ``no'' to one reporter's question on
whether he was considering a ticket in which President Reagan would
hold the No. 2 slot.

<HEAD>Three Die In Raft Accident Filming Former Governor's Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three people fell from a raft and died
while filming a television program with former Gov. Jay Hammond in
a rapid river in mountainous southeastern Alaska, authorities said.
   Hammond was one of the seven people aboard the 16-foot raft, but
he was not injured, said Vaughn Baker, a National Park Service
ranger at Glennallen.
   The accident occurred Saturday afternoon on the Tana River in
the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, about 240 miles
east of Anchorage.
   Four people were flipped out of the raft by rapids in the Tana
River Canyon, but a woman was pulled back aboard, Baker said.
   Two passengers were found unconscious, and could not be revived,
Baker said. The third victim was found dead early Sunday, he said.
   The victims were not immediately identified.
   Authorities were notified of the accident on Saturday, and the
survivors were rescued Sunday.
   Hammond retired from politics after serving as Alaska governor
from 1974 to 1982. Hammond and the others were filming a segment
for his program, ``Jay Hammond's Alaska,'' which features
interviews with Alaska residents.
   After the accident, guide Paul Claus and a passenger floated
downstream to a gravel bar that serves as a landing strip. Claus'
father, John, spotted an emergency signal on the landing strip when
the party failed to arrive at a scheduled pickup point, Baker said.
   Returning in a smaller plane, the elder Claus picked up his son
and flew to a ranger station about 20 miles east of the canyon. A
helicopter could not reach the canyon because of darkness, said
Baker.
   In the meantime, supplies were dropped to the survivors and
another guide hiked upstream to help the group overnight.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Sunday that Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire in their war
followed by direct talks. He said he would announce a truce date
Monday.
   The cease-fire could take effect within two weeks.
   Perez de Cuellar made the announcement after a full day of talks
with Iranian and Iraqi envoys.
   ``I have informed the Security Council that the two sides agreed
with a cease-fire followed by direct talks under my auspices,'' he
said after briefing the council.
   Perez de Cuellar said he still was ``working on the date.''
   ``In principle, I will announce the cease-fire tomorrow. Full
stop,'' he said.
   Earlier, Perez de Cuellar said a truce in the 8-year-old war
could take effect within 10 days after the setting of a date.
   Perez de Cuellar's announcement came after Iran's foreign
minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, told reporters his country would hold
face-to-face talks with Iraq after a cease-fire was declared.
   Security Council President Li Luye of China told reporters
Sunday: ``The secretary-general said he will announce the day of
the cease-fire tomorrow. We are encouraged by what he told us.
   ``The council supports him.''
   The British ambassador, Sir Crispen Tickell, said after a
Security Council meeting, ``What we are focusing on now are
logistical arrangements that should follow a cease-fire.''
   Tickell, asked if there were major problems, said: ``It's much
more a question of logistics.'' He said it would be ``quite
difficult'' to organize the U.N.'s 250-man peacekeeping force but
believed it could be done in two weeks.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said, ``This is another step
on the road to peace.''
   ``Hurdles remain ... the tremendous resentment and bitterness of
eight years of war, but I think in the physical steps in coming to
the end of war, we are moving rapidly,'' Walters said.
   Iran's announcement Sunday morning amounted to acceptance of
Iraq's offer Saturday to accept a cease-fire if Iran announced its
willingness to hold direct talks afterward, although Velayati made
no mention of the Iraqi proposal.
   ``We accepted the proposal of the secretary-general (on) the
face-to-face negotiations after the cease-fire,'' Velayati told
reporters outside U.N. headquarters after meeting with Perez de
Cuellar for more than two hours.
   Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani met the secretary-general later
and received Iran's formal reply.
   ``It's a very good day. I think we are on the road to peace,''
Kittani said as he entered the meeting. As he left, he said he had
a good meeting, but when asked if he was satisfied, he said,
``That's something else.''
   The offer by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Saturday was a
reversal of Iraq's previous demand for direct talks before a
cease-fire, and it capped three weeks of intensive efforts by Perez
de Cuellar to bridge gaps between the two sides.
   Iran announced unexpectedly last month that it accepted Security
Council Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the war,
but it balked at Iraq's demand for talks before the truce.
   Iraq, which accepted the resolution when it was issued last
year, demanded the talks as a test of Iran's sincerity.
   In Tehran on Sunday, Iranians in the streets seemed optimistic
that the war was nearing its end.
   ``This is it,'' said an elderly man in English. He refused to
give his name.
   ``The war is finished,'' said a young man who gave his name only
as Hussein.
   The front-page banner of Tehran's principal morning newspaper,
Jomhuri Islami, read: ``Iraqi Regime Retreats Politically, Has To
Accept Cease-fire.''
   The Iranian riyal rose sharply against the dollar and other
currencies because of increased demands for Iranian currency in
hopes of a postwar boom in the Iranian economy.
   In Kuwait, Defense Minister Sheik Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah was
quoted as saying he believes foreign warships will leave the
Persian Gulf if the Iraq-Iran war is brought to an end.
   ``It is natural to say the fleets will withdraw from gulf waters
when the war ends and the reason for their presence disappears,''
Sheik Nawaf told Al-Seyassah newspaper in an interview.
   Kuwait reflagged 11 of its tankers under the Stars and Stripes
and has been receiving escort through the gulf from U.S. warships
as protection from Iranian attack. Iran accused Kuwait of
supporting Iraq in the war. European and Soviet ships are also in
the gulf.

   An Irish customs officer was charged
Sunday with belonging to the Irish Republican Army after police
seized electronic equipment they said could be used to elude
British anti-terrorist scanning devices.
   The charge came after the IRA claimed responsibility for killing
six people and injuring 37 last week in a series of bombings and
shootings in Britain, West Germany and Northern Ireland.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Frank
Sutcliffe was arrested Friday after three weeks of surveillance.
   In that operation, authorities said they seized walkie-talkie
radio sets and a sniper rifle. The walkie-talkies carried devices
which the police sources said could block efforts to locate
radio-controlled bombs planted by the IRA.
   The IRA is waging a guerrilla war to unite the
Protestant-dominated British province of Northern Ireland with the
Republic of Ireland, where Roman Catholic are in the majority.
   Sutcliffe, 30, of Dublin, appeared Sunday at a special sitting
of Dublin's anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court.
   He was charged with membership in the IRA, which is outlawed
both in the Irish Republic and in Northern Ireland. The court was
told Sutcliffe, who was released on $7,040 bail, would also face
additional charges.

   The National Front, a new alliance of
seven parties, on Sunday elected a movie actor as its chairman to
lead the fight against Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his Congress
Party.
   The National Front was formed Saturday to challenge the
governing Congress Party in national parliamentary elections
scheduled for the end of 1989.
   Under India's electoral system, the head of the party that wins
the most seats in Parliament becomes prime minister.
   The new chairman, N.T. Ramo Rao, told a news conference Sunday
that the seven parties in the front will retain their separate
identities but will field their candidates on a single slate.
   Rama Rao, known for portraying Hindu gods in his film roles,
heads the Telegu Desam party based in the southern state of Andhra
Pradesh.
   With 30 seats, his party is the largest opposition group in the
544-member Parliament. Gandhi's party has 415.
   The other parties in the National Front are Janata, Lok Dal, Jan
Morcha, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Asom Gana Parishad and a
breakaway faction of the Congress Party.
   Former Defense Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, once an ally of
Ghandi and now a critic, was given the No. 2 job in the National
Front. Singh, who heads the Jan Morcha (Peoples' Front), won a
parliamentary seat in a by-election in June. He has said he does
not want to be considered for the prime minister's post.

<HEAD>Founder of Colony of German Immigrants Denies Torture Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of a secretive colony of West
German immigrants denied during bedside questioning by a Chilean
judge that the enclave had been used as a torture center,
newspapers reported Sunday.
   They said Paul Schaefer was questioned for four hours Saturday
by Judge Lidia Villagran at Dignity Colony, 210 miles south of
Santiago in the Andean foothills.
   Schaefer, who served in the German air force in World War II,
led a group of West German Free Baptists to Chile and established
the colony in the early 1960s. It now has about 300 members.
   Mrs. Villagran is a resident of the city of Parral 12 miles from
Dignity Colony. She was asked by a court in Munich, West Germany,
to investigate allegations that the colony was used as a torture
and execution center by Chilean secret police after a military coup
in September 1973 that ousted the government of elected President
Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   The Munich court is handling a slander suit by colony leaders
against the West German branch of Amnesty International and Stern
magazine for making the allegations.
   Schaefer was to have testified in Mrs. Villagran's court Friday,
but his doctors said he was confined to a bed in the colony because
of a heart problem. The judge then went to the colony accompanied
by lawyers for both sides in the slander suit.
   The Santiago newspapers La Epoca and Ultimas Noticias carried
transcripts of Schaefer's testimony.
   According to the reports, Schaefer denied that a former colony
president, Hermann Schmidt, had helped Chilean police agents select
suspected leftists for detainment. ``That's crazy, that's stupid,''
he was quoted as saying.
   The reports said he was asked if people were tortured at the
colony, either by secret police or colony members, and replied,
``That isn't true.''
   Reporters who tried to enter the colony with the judge's
entourage were blocked by a group of colony supporters.
   The colony is surrounded by fences and public access is
prohibited.
   Some former colony members have claimed they were physically and
psychologically abused and exploited as slave labor while they

allegations at the request of the West German government.

   A tentative settlement was reached Sunday
in contract talks for 1,600 nurses at two city hospitals, but
strikes by nearly 4,000 nurses and other workers continued at eight
private hospitals.
   Nurses at San Francisco General Hospital, Laguna Honda Hospital,
and several city health clinics set a Monday strike deadline, but
extended it on a day-to-day basis.
   ``We reached this settlement on time because none of the parties
wanted to add to the health care fears that have permeated this
city'' since the labor disputes began, said Mayor Art Agnos at a
City Hall news conference.
   Details of the pact were not released. Local 790 of the United
Public Employees sought to reduce nurse-patient ratios and improve
measures to retain and recruit nurses. Pay was not an issue.
   Talks were held around-the-clock, and the settlement was reached
about 4:30 a.m. Sunday, said Eileen Mahoney, a spokeswoman for the
mayor's office.
   San Francisco General Hospital cares for the city's poorest and
sickest patients and Laguna Honda has about 1,000 elderly patients.
   Union members will vote on the proposal Tuesday.
   Agnos also called for an immediate resumption of bargaining in
the strikes, adding he planned to ``very actively, very
aggressively'' involve himself and other city officials in the
disputes.
   No new talks have been scheduled in the strikes.
   Seven hospitals were struck July 26 by 1,700 licensed vocational
nurses and hospital workers represented by Local 250 of the
Hospital and Health Care Workers Union. On Aug. 2, more than 2,000
registered nurses represented by the California Nurses Association
struck at six of those facilities.
   On Saturday, 130 nurses represented by the California Nurses
Association and an undetermined number of service workers
represented by Local 250 also went on strike at French Hospital.
   The struck hospitals have remained open.
   The strike by Local 250 is mainly over health benefits and sick
leave. Increased pay is the issue with the California Nurses
Association, which wants an 11 percent raise for the first year and
a 10 percent raise the second year of a two-year contract.
   The hospitals are negotiating as a group called Affiliated
Hospitals, and have offered 18 percent raises over 31 months, which
would cost the affected six hospitals $40 million.
   Talks with French Hospital employees are separate from the other
negotiations.

Declared Vacant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk said Sunday that
Cambodia's seat at the United Nations should be declared vacant
because the Khmer Rouge is exploiting it to try to improve its
blood-stained image.
   Sihanouk spoke with reporters at Site B after escorting British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a tour of the camp, which holds
53,000 refugess. Site B, 5{ miles from the Cambodian border, is the
main civilian base for Sihanouk's followers.
   Mrs. Thatcher was on the second day of a visit to Thailand and
is to return to London Tuesday.
   She presented some of the refugees with cooking utensils, yarn,
English-language textbooks, cloth and medicine. Britain has given
more than $20 million in aid to the refugees and will provide
another million dollars this year, she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she agreed with Sihanouk that the Khmer Rouge
should not be allowed to return to power.
   Sihanouk's supporters are in a fractious alliance with the
radical Khmer Rouge and anti-communuist forces waging guerrilla
warfare against the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government.
   Sihanouk was deposed and the Cambodian monarchy abolished in
1970. The Khmer Rouge gained power in the spring of 1975, defeating
the U.S.-backed government, and hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
were killed in a brutal campaign to establish a communist agrarian
society.
   In December 1978 the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia, ousted the
Khmer Rouge and installed another communist government.
   Cambodia's U.N. seat remained with the Khmer Rouge, but its
delegation was joined by representatives of the two other
resistance groups after the three formed an alliance in 1982.
   Sihanouk said that declaring the Cambodian seat vacant would
help efforts to find a settlement to the war.
   Representatives of the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments met
for the first time with leaders of the resistance groups last month
in Indonesia, but no significant progress was reported. Vietnam has
an estimated 100,000 soldiers in Cambodia.
   Sihanouk resigned in July as president of the resistance
coalition, saying Khmer Rouge guerrillas were attacking his
supporters. ``More than 100 officers and soldiers died in such
recent attacks,'' he said Sunday.
   He also said opposition to the Khmer Rouge had led not only to a
truce but even to cooperation between his forces and the Cambodian
government.
   ``It is a question of survival,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher told a gathering of thousands of refugees:
   ``The Vietnamese must go. But we must not allow the return of
the murderous Pol Pot regime to return. No civilized country could
accept that.''
   Pol Pot was the head of the Khmer Rouge during its bloody
1975-78 purges, but he was removed from positions of power after
the Vietnamese ousted his government.

<TEXT>
   This normally placid little farm town
busted loose Sunday in anticipation of a once-in-a-lifetime
celebration _ the magic day of 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight.
   A swarm of visitors brought bumper-to-bumper traffic to the
town's only thoroughfare for Sunday's festivities, which included a
parade, antique car show and the cutting of a commemorative cake _
8 feet, 8 inches long; 8.8 inches wide and 8.8 inches high.
   But the most talked-about part of the town's celebration was set
for Monday night: the marriage of Tom Accardo and Deborah Muhlbeier
of Casper, Wyo., at 8:08 p.m. That's 8:08 on 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight.
   The couple had not yet set a date when they learned of the town
on a television news report.
   ``Deb just looked at me and said, `Wouldn't that be fun to go in
there and get married on 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight, Kentucky?''' said
Accardo, 29, a sales representative for a supply company.
   The couple tried to write the mayor of Eighty Eight, soon
learning there wasn't one, Accardo said. They heard instead from
postmistress Donnie Sue Bacon, and plans for an outdoor wedding,
performed by a county magistrate, soon took shape.
   Pearl Russie of DeKalb, Ill., was among Sunday's early arrivals,
driving up to the front steps of the Eighty Eight Market in her
Oldsmobile Delta 88. Her license plate, ``ANY 88,'' was an
immediate attention-grabber.
   ``I'm an 88 freak,'' said Ms. Russie, 45, a custodian at
Northern Illinois University.
   She had to buy a new set of tires to make the 500-mile trip,
but, ``when I heard there was a town called Eighty Eight, I had to
come here,'' she said.
   ABC's ``Good Morning, America'' on Monday planned to broadcast
from the town in south-central Kentucky farm country about 40 miles
east of Bowling Green.
   ``It's fun. We won't ever have this happen again,'' said Mrs.
Bacon, who this year became the darling of stamp collectors around
the world.
   Mail has been arriving in bundles at the tiny post office from
collectors covetous of Mrs. Bacon's Eighty Eight postmark.
   Postal Service regional headquarters in Louisville sent a mobile
post office to help with postmarking and to hawk a variety of
philatelic items.
   They included specially embossed envelopes and postcards, plus
stamp collector kits. The most popular goodies, however, were royal
blue caps, T-shirts and sun visors with a facsimile Eighty Eight,
Ky., postmark.
   Across the street at the market, owner Rosemary McPherson sold
her own shirts and caps.
   Ms. Russie bought four T-shirts and 20 postcards. She also took
advantage of the market's commemorative menu.
   ``I got a special 88-cent hamburger,'' she said. ``Four cents
tax makes 92, so there's 8 cents change. Good.''
   Legend has it that Eighty Eight was named by Dabnie Nunnally, a
postmaster in the 1860s. He wanted to give the town a digital name,
reached into his pocket, found 88 cents in change, and that was it.

   A wealthy businessman made a public plea
Sunday for the release of his wife, who was apparently kidnapped
from the couple's home nearly two weeks ago.
   Annie Laurie Hearin, 72, disappeared July 26, and her husband,
Robert Hearin, found a ransom note at their home that evening.
Authorities have said the vaguely worded note suggests the
kidnapping may have been an act of vengeance stemming from Hearin's
business dealings.
   ``Like any businessman, I have made decisions which may appear
to others as unfeeling, but those appearances are not true,'' said
Hearin, reading from a statement outside his home. ``Moreover,
those business decisions were mine, not my wife's, and she had
nothing to do with them.
   ``My children and I appeal to whomever has my wife to return her
safely to us,'' he said, with his daughter and son standing behind
him.
   Hearin is president of the Mississippi Valley Gas Co., and has
insurance and bank holdings. His worth is estimated at $100 million.
   Mrs. Hearin was last seen by a family maid after a bridge game.
She suffers from an intestinal disease that doctors say could be
fatal if she does not receive daily medication.
   The ransom note instructed Hearin to pay an unspecified amount
within 10 days to former employees of School Pictures of
Mississippi Inc., of which Hearin is a major stockholder.
   The note named 12 men whom authorities identified as disgruntled
former employees of the company, which takes pictures of school
children.
   The 10-day deadline expired Saturday without further word from
the kidnapper or kidnappers on the amount or method of payment.
   After making the statement, Hearin did not answer questions, and
Mayor Dale Danks, who was at his side, would not talk about details
of the case.
   ``Mr. Hearin felt, obviously, that he wanted to communicate. As
you know he has been waiting for some time for additional
instruction,'' Danks said. ``He made it very clear at the outset
that the initial contact and the only contact that had been made
was very vague for him to understand and carry out.''
   Danks would not say whether Hearin has attempted to make
payments to any of the 12 named in the note.

   One lucky ticket holder hit the record
$23 million Florida Lotto jackpot, lottery officials said Sunday,
but no one had called in to claim the prize.
   Lottery officials determined that the ticket was purchased in
Brandon, just east of Tampa, but details on the winner and the
outlet where the ticket was sold were unavailable Sunday, said
lottery spokeswoman Rebecca Negron.
   The six numbers drawn Saturday night were 12-15-17-18-31-42.
   The estimated $23 million jackpot, to be paid out over 20 years,
was the product of record one-week sales of more than $26.6
million, said Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul. That doubled the
previous sales record of $12.9 million. Exact size of the jackpot
won't be iknown until Monday.
   On Saturday alone, Lotto players purchased 11.5 million $1
tickets, the largest single day of sales since the games began in
April. During a peak sales hour Saturday, the system was generating
more than $24,480 per minute.
   Saturday's Lotto drawing produced more than $6.5 million in
prizes for the 610,000 players who matched three, four or five of
the winning numbers.
   But the number of payouts meant those winners would have to wait
for their money until Monday to allow the computers to process all
the claims, Mrs. Paul said.

   A heat wave has killed 38 people in the central
Chinese city of Wuhan, an official report appearing Sunday said.
   The China News Service, in a dispatch published in Hong Kong
newspapers, said the heat wave that began last month was the worst
in 39 years.
   It said temperatures in Wuhan reached 104 degrees on some days.
The report did not elaborate.
   Wuhan is on the Yangtze River, 630 miles south of Beijing.
   In July, the Chinese press reported the heat wave killed 71
people in Shanghai, 290 in the southern city of Nanchang and 83 in
the coastal city of Nanjing.

   George Bush said Sunday he'll debate Michael Dukakis more than
once, and Bush's soon-to-be campaign chairman says the candidate
will be speaking his mind a lot more after the GOP convention.
   ``There will be debates, and I look forward to them,'' Bush said
Sunday after attending church services with his family in
Kennebunkport, Maine. ``But I'm not the nominee of our party yet
and we have plenty of time to determine how many, where and all of
that.''
   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many...has not been
sorted out yet,'' he said, denying an accusation by the Dukakis
campaign that he was shying away from confronting his Democratic
rival.
   The Dukakis campaign was quick to call what it said was Bush's
bluff: ``Once again, Vice President Bush is talking tough to the
cameras but is refusing to meet Mike Dukakis in a face-to-face
debate,'' campaign manager Susan Estrich said. ``It's time to dock
the motorboat in Kennebunkport and launch the debate in Annapolis.''
   Last week, Estrich and Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign
chairman, sent a letter to Bush campaign officials criticizing the
vice president for not agreeing to a series of three presidential
debates and one vice presidential debate proposed by a bipartisan
panel. The first such debate would be Sept. 14 in Annapolis, Md.
   As Bush was with his family, outgoing Treasury secretary James
A. Baker III said the vice president will be free to speak on
issues ``distinct and different from the administration'' after
he's formally nominated.
   He also said ``the chairman of the Republican party was not
empowered to commit the party's nominee, and he would tell you that
he did not make any such commitment.''
   Baker, resigning in time to take over as Bush's campaign
chairman when the Republican National Convention nominates him in
New Orleans next week, said Bush has already started to develop his
``own individual persona.''
   At a Boston news conference the day before the Republicans sit
down in New Orleans to draft their platform, Democratic National
Committee Chairman Paul Kirk and U.S. Rep. William Gray,
D-Pennsylvania, criticized past GOP practice. They accused the
Republicans of failing to live up to a host of promises they made
in 1984.
   A statement from the Democrats said the Reagan administration
promised in 1984 to get tough on terrorists only to later trade
arms for hostages with Iran; that after promising to hold public
officials to the highest standards, 242 administration officials
resigned under indictment, scandal or the threat of prosecution;
and that despite a commitment to health care, 37 million Americans
lack health insurance and the 1984 GOP platform failed to even
mention AIDS.
   In New Orleans, leaders of the Republican platform committee
predicted there will be no separate sections outlining minority
views in the 1988 party platform, continuing a pattern established
in the Reagan campaign years of 1980 and 1984.
   Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, the chairwoman of the platform
committee, said that aside from a few issues _ drug abuse, AIDS,
rights of the handicapped and child care _ ``we don't see a major
departure'' from the 1984 platform, which she described as ``a good
foundation for us.''
   The 1984 GOP platform opposed any tax increases, declined to
support the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and endorsed proposed
constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget and
giving the president power to veto specific items in budget bills.
   Baker excused Bush's underdog position in the polls as a natural
result of his loyalty to an outgoing administration. Interviewed on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' he also said Bush's pledge not to
raise taxes if elected is a credible position to take.
   ``He will be seen in an entirely different light once he is his
party's nominee, a bit more free to speak out, speak his own mind,
and speak out on issues distinct and different from the
administration,'' Baker said.
   In Kennebunkport, Bush said his standing in the polls would rise
as he pressed Dukakis on the issues. ``It's not negative
(campaigning),'' Bush said. ``It has to be done. And once it's
done, the polls will take care of themselves.''
   He accused Dukakis of ``flip flopping'' on a freeze on nuclear
weapons, of mismanaging the budget of Massachusetts and of seeking
to ``cut the muscle out of our strategic defense.''
   And, said Bush, ``He goes down to New Jersey and talks about the
pollution off New Jersey and look, over his shoulder is Boston
harbor, one of the most seriously polluted bodies of water in this
country.''
   Baker, who led Bush's unsuccessful fight against Reagan for the
1980 presidential nomination, said Bush already begun to make his
individual stands known.
   He cited Bush's opposition to suggestions that drug-trafficking
charges might be dropped against Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega
and his stands on AIDS, child care, energy policies and education.
   On the Republican vice presidential choice, Baker declined to
speculate on who Bush will pick but said the considerations are, in
order: whether the nominee is clearly competent, is compatible with
Bush, will not hurt the ticket, and will help the ticket.
   Bush said he has ``not really'' made any progress on choosing a
running mate.
   Baker, who was Reagan's chief of staff before becoming Treasury
secretary in 1985, said Bush's pledge not to raise taxes if elected
is credible because of his proposals to implement a ``flexible
freeze'' on spending.
   ``The truth of the matter is that this budget deficit has been
declining a great deal more rapidly than people thought it would,
just by virute of limitations on the increase inspending,'' he
said. ``And that's the way that we ought to really handle this
deficit _ stop increasing spending, don't raise taxes.''

   A racing boat apparently hit debris in the
water during a 50-lap race Sunday and flew up a riverbank into a
crowd of spectators, injuring 24 people, including 11 children,
police said.
   The Three Rivers Regatta race was halted for 90 minutes while
rescue teams and ambulances tried to get to the accident scene in
Roberto Clemente Park, where hundreds had gathered to watch the
race at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers,
police said.
   The area also was congested with cars from people attending a
Pirates-New York Mets baseball game at Three Rivers Stadium,
located adjacent to the riverside park in the heart of Pittsburgh.
   ``It was a mess,'' said police officer John Potter.
   The injured were taken to five hospitals and police said eight
people were listed in critical condition.
   Race officials said the propeller of a boat driven by Robert
Wood, 23, of North Peterborough, Ontario, apparently snagged debris
and came off, and the boat veered out of control.
   Another driver in the race, John Provich, said officials
recovered a railroad tie from the river with propeller marks on it.
   Police Lt. Leo O'Neill characterized the wood as ``a rather
large log.''
   Witnesses said the boat suddenly became airborne in choppy water
while in a straightaway, veered sharply to the right, and slammed
into spectators on the grassy, wooded riverbank. The boat's engines
were off when it hit the bank at about 40 mph and flipped several
times, the witnesses said.
   ``I saw it when it hit,'' said Debbie Triantafilo of Pittsburgh,
who was selling soft drinks near the accident. ``It happened pretty
quickly. It hit about a dozen people.''
   Barry Carras, medical director for the U.S. Formula One Grand
Prix race, said Wood suffered only slight injuries and was being
treated for shock.
   Officials said they did not know how fast the boat was going at
the time of the accident. The top speed during qualifying runs was
119 mph.
   An estimated 100,000 people were scattered along the banks of
the rivers watching the 15-boat race, which was on the seventh lap
at the time of the accident, officers on the scene said.
   The accident happened just after the boat had passed beneath the
Fort Duquesne Bridge. The boat landed on its side, with the engine
toward the spectators and the bow toward the water.
   Jane Montgomery, nursing supervisor at Allegheny General
Hospital, said four of the injured were taken to that hospital and
were being evaluated. She said she did not know the extent of their
injuries.
   Other victims were taken to Divine Providence Hospital,
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Presbyterian-University Hospital
and Mercy Hospital, authorities said.
   Formula One boats, which have eight- and six-cylinder engines
and weigh up to 1,000 pounds, are the fastest outboard powered race
boats in the world, according to the race's sponsors. Drivers can
reach speeds of more than 140 mph on straightaways and 90 mph on
turns, officials said.

   A hydrofoil rammed a small fishing boat
off the Sicilian coast, killing at least three people, police said
Sunday.
   The hydrofoil, which carries passengers between the islands of
Lipari and Salina in the Aeolian island chain north of Sicily, hit
the motorboat Saturday, police said.
   They said the fishing boat apparently failed to take proper
precautions in crossing the path of the hydrofoil.
   Six people, all Italians, were aboard the motorboat, which sank
after the accident, police said.
   The hydrofoil recovered the bodies of a 14-year-old girl; and
two men, ages 23 and 39. Two other men, ages 24 and 45, were
seriously injured and hospitalized in Lipari.
   Police and other boats were patrolling the area, about a mile
off Lipari's coast, in search of a missing 22-year-old man.
   No one was injured aboard the hydrofoil.

   A crowd of 750 people protesting the nightly
closure of a city park clashed with 375 police officers early
Sunday, and nine people were arrested. There were varying estimates
of injuries.
   Five complaints of alleged police brutality were filed as a
result of the melee over Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's East
Village, said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Some residents had asked that police close the park each night
because it is a hangout for drug users and dealers and rowdy
drunks. Also, legions of homeless people and so-called punk
rockers, who dress in black leather and spike their hair, use the
park at night.
   Capt. Gerald McNamara, the neighborhood police commander, said
he had orders from Mayor Edward I. Koch not to try again Sunday
night to close the park. Mayoral spokesman Larry Simonberg said the
order referred only to Sunday night and to as long as a heat wave
continues.
   Earlier Sunday, Detective Louis Llanes said officers were sent
to close the park at midnight and people started blocking traffic.
   ``Mounted police moved in to disperse and they were hit by
bottles. They pulled back and police on foot were sent in,'' Llanes
said.
   Then some fires were set. ``The Fire Department came to
extinguish them and they were hit with rocks,'' Llanes said.
   He estimated the disruption involved 750 demonstrators and 450
police officers.
   ``Police were calling people scum, twirling their nightsticks.
And the kids were inciting them too, but they weren't throwing
bottles or anything,'' said Dan Kelley, 26, who lives in the
neighborhood.
   At one point, a loud explosion of fireworks went off behind the
police line.
   ``At this very tense moment, police scattered,'' and some
demonstrators rushed back into the park, Kelley said.
   ``Then police doubled back and came back. The crowd went nuts.
Horses were charging in a sense and then bottles started flying.
People started getting hit by billy clubs. I ran across the street.
I was really afraid of getting trampled,'' he said.
   ``An entire neighborhood was terrorized,'' added Sharon Breslau,
who has lived a half block from the park for the past eight years.
``There was no time for `What? Where? Excuse me, what's your badge
number?' It was a riot.''
   Ms. Breslau, 30, watched the action from her house: ``There were
hundreds of people running for their lives.''
   She said the brigade of police ``came right up on the sidewalk
and knocked people down with their horses.''
   Ms. Breslau said she witnessed three or four officers knock one
man down and hit him with their billy clubs.
   ``At that point, I lost my mind. I started screaming `Don't hit
people. Don't hit people' as loud as I could. This happened five
feet from me.''
   It was the second such incident at Tompkins Square.
   Early the previous Sunday, in response to residents' complaints,
police went to the park after midnight and asked a rock band to
stop playing.
   ``They were responsive, but a small percentage of the spectators
became agitated and began throwing bottles at police,'' Llanes
said. Four people were arrested and five officers injured in that
disturbance, Llanes said.
   All of the injuries this week also were ``basically minor,''
said Capt. William Olsen of the Emergency Medical Service.
   Olsen said 13 civilians and five police officers were injured.
   The police department had slightly different figures. Llanes
said seven officers were injured and nine civilians.
   A spokesman at Beth Israel Hospital, located near the park, said
28 people walked in on their own seeking treatment.
   O'Donnell said there had been nine arrests _ six of those on
riot and assault charges, both felonies. The other arrests were for
disorderly conduct and other misdemeanors.
   All city parks technically close at 1 a.m., said Gary Zarr,
spokesman for the Parks Department, but curfews are actively
enforced at only two Manhattan parks, Washington Square and
Stuyvesant Park.
   ``Some members of the community asked for the curfews because
there was a lot of antisocial activity going on in those two
parks,'' Zarr said. ``Stuyvesant has a fence so the Parks
Department could literally close the gates. But most parks however
don't have gates, so they are open passage areas where people can
enter at night.''

official news agency Venpres said Sunday.
   Hernandez Grisanti resigned Saturday and also would join the
electoral campaign of former president Carlos Andres Perez, the
presidential candidate of the governing Democratic Action Party,
the news agency said.
   Elections are in December.
   President Jaime Lusinchi named Julio Cesar Gil, the assistant
energy minister, to replace Hernandez Grisanti in the Cabinet.
   Andres Perez has been nominated to succeed Lusinchi. His main
opponent in the election will be Eduardo Fernandez from the Social

<HEAD>Vietnam Criticizes U.S. For Linking MIAs With Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese newspaper criticized the
United States Sunday, saying it linked the establishment of
diplomatic relations with demands that Vietnam account for missing
U.S. servicemen.
   The Communist Party daily Nhan Dan said the United States ``must
bear full responsibility for the obstacles it has set up in the
process of settling the issue of Americans missing in action in the
Vietnam War and other humanitarian questions.''
   The United States lists more than 1,700 American servicemen as
missing in action, or MIA, in Vietnam.
   Last week, Vietnam said it halted cooperation on the MIA issue
and on the resettlement in America of former prisoners of
re-education camps. Most of those prisoners were sent to the camps
after communist forces defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese
government in April 1975.
   Vietnam earlier expressed anger at the U.S. State Department's
criticism of a congressional resolution calling for establishment
of ``interest sections,'' low-level diplomatic missions, in
Washington and the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.
   The State Department urged continuing the policy of isolating
Vietnam until it withdraws its estimated 100,000 military personnel
from Cambodia. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted
the radical Khmer Rouge regime that had ruled since the spring of
1975 and installed another communist government. When Vietnam
suspended cooperation on the issue of MIAs and former Vietnamese
political prisoners, Washington claimed the Vietnamese had broken a
promise not to link the question of diplomatic ties with
humanitarian matters.
   The Nhan Dan article, carried by the Vietnam News Agency
monitored in Bangkok, said it was Vietnam's consistent policy not
to link humanitarian with political issues.
   It said, ``The U.S. side has also agreed to do this, but in fact
it has violated this agreement.''
   ``Time and again the U.S. administration has linked the MIA
question with the normalization of of U.S.-Vietnamese relations,''
Nhan Dan said. ``In his statement in Hawaii on July 21, U.S.
Secretary of State (George) Shultz connected the normalization of
the two countries' relations with an acceptable Kampuchea
(Cambodia) and the settlement of the MIA issue.''
   It said the United States rejected Vietnam's proposal for
resettlement of the former re-education camp inmates and
``responsible officials in Washington have voiced hostility towards
Vietnam.''

<HEAD>Scientists Say Dives Exciting, But No Hot Springs Found Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists on Sunday said
their first dive to the bottom of the nation's deepest lake was
exciting, but they didn't find any evidence of the thermal springs
they were seeking.
   Jack Dymond and Robert Collier, oceanographers at Oregon State
University, each used a one-person submarine to search Crater Lake
for hot springs that may be the remnants of the volcanic activity
that formed the lake nearly 7,000 years ago.
   ``We haven't found any actual thermal springs,'' said Dymond,
who Friday became the first man to reach the bottom of the lake.
``In some ways we're just getting started. I think in the next week
or 10 days we'll be much further along.''
   The oceanographers are taking part in a National Park Service
research project to determine why the lake is so clear. Visibility
in the lake has been measured to a depth of between 85 and 115 feet.
   The study was started after scientists in the 1970s noticed a
significant reduction in the clarity of the lake. Recent
measurments have shown the clarity returning to levels last
measured in the 1930s.
   The deepest point in the lake is 1,932 feet, making it the
seventh-deepest lake in the world. The lake is in southwestern
Oregon.
   Collier, who made his first dive Saturday, said it took about 20
minutes to reach the bottom and, at a depth of 1,200 feet, blue
light was still visible from above.
   Dymond likened the bottom to a moonscape, with 2-foot diameter
boulders and rock walls and ridges. He said he also saw what he
interpreted to be evidence of old hot springs _ deposits of iron
and manganese and rock formations with colored stains on holes or
cracks.
   While the submarine operated well, sonar echos off unexpectedly
craggy features on the bottom of the lake made precise navigation
difficult and efforts are being made to correct the problem, the
scientists said.
   ``We can only tell where we are every five minutes,'' Collier
said. ``I'd like to know every minute.''
   Precise navigation is important. Last year, while using a
remote-controlled submersible equipped with a video camera, the
scientists stumbled across what looked like a vent oozing a milky
substance. However, they never were able to relocate it to take a
temperature reading or a fluid sample.
   Crater Lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled the
basin left by the collapse of Mount Mazama in the Cascade Range
nearly 7,000 year ago.
   Both Dymond and Collier said they experienced brief moments of
fear during their descent, but quickly became engrossed in their
work.
   Collier said much of what he saw was sediment covering the
bottom, with wavy markings that may have been worm tubes. He said
he also saw small rocks and sunken pieces of trees that were
probably rafted out to the interior of the lake by ice as well as
an angular object apparently made by man that could have been
dropped off a tour boat.
   ``I pretty much saw the same thing for five hours,'' Collier
said.

<TEXT>
   A team of Soviet inspectors will check
a base for U.S. cruise missiles and a maintenance plant this week
in Belgium, the U.S. Embassy announced Sunday.
   The inspectors will visit the facilities under terms of the
Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by the United States and
Soviet Union in December. The agreement eliminated an entire class
of weapons with a range of 600-3,000 miles.
   The Soviet inspectors will arrive in Belgium on Monday and visit
the cruise missile base in Florennes, site of the 485th U.S.
Tactical Missile Wing, on Tuesday, the embassy said. The base is
about 50 miles southeast of Brussels.
   During the tour, they will also inspect the SABCA aviation plant
in nearby Gosselies, where the missiles are maintained, the embassy
said. It did not say how many inspectors would be in the group.
   Sixteen cruise missiles were deployed at Florennes in 1985.
Another 32 missiles were to be deployed if the treaty had not been
signed.
   Cruise missiles are ground-hugging missiles that can elude radar
detection.
   Similar Soviet inspections have already taken place in West
Germany, Britain, Holland and Italy, as well as in U.S. test
plants. U.S. inspectors are also inspecting facilities in East bloc
nations under the treaty.

   A report by the London Broadcasting Co. said Hadi Issa Grada,

opposed to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Officials in the Home Office, which is in charge of internal
security and immigration, refused to comment on the specific
allegations against Grada.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd informed Grada, who has a British
wife and two children, that his presence in Britain was ``not
conducive to the public good for reasons of national security,''
said a Home Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Grada's wife told the domestic news agency Press Association

   Retired federal Judge J. Skelly Wright, who
handled the Pentagon Papers case and wrote the decree ending de

He was 77.
   He retired last year after 25 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals
here _ two as chief judge _ and 13 years as a U.S. District Judge
in his native New Orleans, where he began public service as
assistant U.S. attorney in 1937.
   After his 1960 order desegregating the New Orleans school system
drew threats against his life, he was reassigned to Washington,
D.C., where he overturned the school system's racially separate
``tracking system'' in 1967.
   In the Pentagon Papers case of 1971, Wright's minority opinion
that The New York Times and Washington Post had the right to
publish the secret documents on the Vietnam War was upheld by the
U.S. Supreme Court on a 6-3 vote.

<TEXT>
   The District Attorney's office has ordered an
internal review of a Superior Court judge who declared a mistrial
in a drug case when it conflicted with a convention he planned to
attend, officials said.
   Judge Stephen Lachs, 48, said attorneys assured him the trial
would end Aug. 3, a day before he was to leave for an American Bar
Association convention in Toronto, where he was to preside over a
meeting of the family courts committee.
   Lachs, appointed to the court in 1979, said from Toronto on
Friday he hoped the defendant could be tried again, but said both
the prosecutor and the defense attorney knew of his time constraint.
   ``I had my plans to be at the ABA ... annual meeting, and that
was it,'' Lachs said.
   But Chief Deputy District Attorney Gilbert I. Garcetti claimed
the defendant will be set free because the mistrial was declared
before the jury ruled on her guilt or innocence.
   The internal review could lead to a request by the District
Attorney's office for an investigation by the state Commission on
Judicial Performance, which evaluates allegations of impropriety
and makes recommendations to the state Supreme Court.
   A criminal defendant cannot be tried twice for the same offense
and such constitutional protection takes effect as soon as a jury
is sworn in.
   The only exceptions are when one of the lawyers, the judge or
the defendant becomes ill, or when there is a hung jury. In such
cases, a new trial is generally scheduled.
   The jury in the case before Lachs was sworn in Tuesday and ready
to hear final arguments Wednesday afternoon in a trial for felony
possession of about one gram of rock cocaine.
   When a postponment date to accommodate the judge's schedule
couldn't be agreed upon by the attorneys and jurors involved, Lachs
declared a mistrial.
   ``I couldn't think of any other option _ other than to cancel my
flight, which I could have done. I admit that,'' the judge said.

   The Soviet Union, after refraining for months
from sending nuclear submarines to stations off America's east
coast, resumed the patrols early this summer and appears to be
continuing them, defense officials say.
   The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not
identified, disclosed last week that a lone Soviet ``Yankee'' sub
reappeared during the first week of June inside an Atlantic patrol
zone long favored by the Russians.
   The submarine apparently completed its deployment and departed
the area within the last couple of weeks, the sources said. It was
immediately replaced by another Yankee, however, suggesting the
Soviets intend to maintain the patrols at least for the time being,

   The president of France's state-run railroad
resigned Sunday after the second fatal train crash in six weeks.
The government blamed the crash in part on a failure to implement
measures ordered after an earlier wreck.
   Unions blamed the government for Saturday's crash and accused it
of skimping on safety to save money. It said the resignation of
Philippe Rouvillois, who had been railway president six months,
would only camouflage the problem.
   A 29-year-old man was killed and 57 people were injured Saturday
afternoon when a four-car passenger train crashed into a barrier at
the end of the line in Paris' Gare de L'Est station.

   Vans and big cars are the cheapest to fix
while sports cars and specialty models are the most expensive,
according to an insurance industry study of collision repair costs
for 1988 model cars.
   The study by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
research group, examined the frequency of insurance collision
claims and the average cost of claims for 60 new cars during the
first nine months of the 1988 model year.
   ``Even among cars of the same size, class and body style there
were large variations in results,'' the insurance group said. But
generally larger cars had a better collision loss record than
smaller vehicles, the group said.

<HEAD>Energy Department Announces Preferred Buyer For Great Plains Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington has
announced a preferred buyer for its Great Plains Coal Gasification
Plant in North Dakota in a deal that could mean $1.8 billion for
the government over the next 21 years.
   Basin Electric Power Cooperative, based in Bismarck, N.D., was
selected from among nine prospective purchasers who bid for the
plant, which was built in the early 1980s and acquired by the
Energy Department in 1985 when its private sponsors defaulted on
nearly $1.5 billion in federal loans.
   ``Our announcement signals the successful return of a facility
to the private sector after the largest foreclosure in U.S.
government history,'' Herrington said at a briefing Friday, almost
exactly three years after the department acquired the plant.
   ``It turns the further drain on the taxpayer that we faced three
years ago into a substantial recoupment of the taxpayer's money,''
he said.
   Basin Electric is a consumer-owned, regional cooperative that
supplies wholesale electric power to 118 rural electric systems in
eight states. It is expected to retain the majority of the more
than 800 employees now operating the plant, the Energy Department
said in a statement.
   Before the transfer of title can take place, the Energy
Department must forward a detailed description of the sales terms
to Congress for a mandated 30-day review.
   The offer from Basin Electric ``removes the government from
future subsidies and future liabilities,'' Herrington said. ``We
have an offer that removes the government from competing in the
business of producing commercial quantities of fuels, and one that
puts business decisions back in the hands of businessmen.''
   The $1.8 billion value to the government, according to the
department statement, would be in dollars valued at the time they
are received. The initial cash payment would be approximately $85
million.
   An additional $105 million would be returned from the project's
cash reserve fund, $649 million could result from future profit
sharing if energy prices follow projections, $590 million would
result from the waiver of some federal tax credits available to the
project, and $367 million would be received as federal income taxes.
   The department said the actual value will vary with inflation
and gas prices, and the department's views of those factors and
discount rates gives the Basin Electric offer a current value of
$600 million.
   In addition to Basin Electric, the department entered serious
negotiations with two other prospective buyers: the Coastal Corp.,
the parent company of one of the original plant owners, and Mission
First Financial, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison.
   The other six companies that submitted offers were: Beta
Pipeline and Equipment, Inc.; FHN Energy, Inc.; Industrial
Engineering Services; Irving A. Backman; Complete Energy Petroleum,
Inc.; and The Three Affiliated Indian Tribes of the Fort Berthold
Reservation.

<HEAD>Alumimum Prices Up, Industry Healthy After Companies Trim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ron Gerhardt says the upturn in the
aluminum industry can be measured in the extra bales of beer and
soda-pop containers coming through the doors of his Evansville
recycling business.
   U.S. aluminum makers, buoyed by high prices and a worldwide
shortage of products, mostly have recovered from the depths of a
slump two years ago and are posting record profits.
   Tzschoppe Industries Recycling sends more than 10,000 pounds of
aluminum per week to Aluminum Company of America's nearby Warrick
Operations, the largest aluminum smelter in the United States.
   ``Recycling started kind of as an oddity, but now it's getting
to be the normal thing to do,'' said Gerhardt, company president.
   The aluminum turnaround is welcome news in the lower Ohio
Valley, where major aluminum producers, lured to the region by
plentiful coal supplies and excellent river transportation, have
put three smelters within a 40-mile radius. The plants represent
about 16 percent of the country's aluminum smelting capacity.
   Pittsburgh-based Alcoa is completing a four-year, $300 million
modernization at the southern Indiana plant. A similar program is
under way at the company's Alcoa, Tenn., smelter just outside of
Knoxville.
   Other nearby smelters include National-Southwire Aluminum in
Hawesville, Ky., and Alcan Aluminum in Sebree, Ky., where $15.5
million in plant improvements have begun. The company shut down
four production lines in 1985-86.
   ``Aluminum was going down the same path as steel was in the
1980s,'' said Mike Deshaies, Alcoa spokesman in Indiana. ``So we
started cutting back the high-cost, low-profit end of the
business.''
   Alcoa, the nation's largest producer, announced a 25 percent
reduction in smelting capacity three years ago and other producers
took similar steps, closing less efficient plants and idling
production lines.
   ``The industry was trimming down to fighting weight, so to
speak,'' said Frank Rathbun, spokesman for the Aluminum Association
in Washington.
   Foreign countries with large reserves of raw material or
electric power _ a major cost component of aluminum _ could produce
the metal more cheaply.
   But recovering aluminum prices, up from about 40 cents per pound
two years ago to around $1.20 in late July, have generated record
profits for some of the major producers.
   Alcoa reported profits of $200.1 million, or $2.25 per share, on
sales of $7.77 billion for all of 1987 and profits of $416.3
million, or $4.71 per share, on sales of $4.59 billion in the first
six months of this year.
   Reynolds of Richmond, Va., reported 1987 net earnings of $219.5
million, or $4.33 per share, on sales of $4.32 billion and net
earnings of $204.9 million, or $3.84 per share, on revenue of $2.65
billion in the 1988 first half.
   Labor unions that agreed to concessions during the slump also
have noticed the boom times, and will be looking to share in the
profits when they negotiate their next contract.
   The current two-year pacts with the United Steelworkers of
America and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers International
Union lowered benefits by 95 cents per hour for their members at
Aluminum Company of America and Reynolds Metals Co.
   Talks on a new contract are scheduled to begin Monday in
Cincinnati. The old pacts expire May 31, 1989.
   ``This is a very good time from the standpoint of bargaining,''
said Larry E. Sigler, president of Local 104, which represents
workers at the Newburgh plant.
   While celebrating the boom, industry leaders are cautious about
competition from steel producers and also warn that metal prices
are cyclical.
   A weakening of the western economies that use aluminum in
housing, containers and construction could send prices tumbling
again. No one knows how long the good times will last.
   ``If you find 15 aluminum analysts in New York who want to talk
to you about what's happening, you'll come up with 17 different
explanations,'' said Alcan spokesman Stan Lampe.

   Two decades after a feisty young company set
out to make a place for itself in the long-distance telephone
market, MCI Communications Corp. has survived the rites of passage
into corporate adulthood.
   MCI, long considered a brassy and freewheeling risk-taker, has
honed its management style and developed a strategy that has made
it a $5 billion company and the major long-distance competitor of
industry leader American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   ``They are a full-service firm that can compete on all fronts
with AT&T,'' said Jack Grubman, a telephone analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. ``The growing up and pains associated with that
are for the most part behind them and they're looking at a long run
of pretty healthy growth ahead.''
   MCI surprised analysts last month when it reported a ninefold
increase in second-quarter profits, confirming the self-confidence
it displayed a week before when it announced it would buy back the
16.2 percent stake held by International Business Machines Corp.
   In the quarter that ended June 30, MCI reported record net
income of $73 million on record revenues of $1.2 billion,
strengthened by increased sales of 800 and international services
and the continued signing up of large corporate accounts.
   MCI Chairman William G. McGowan, who on Aug. 8, 1968, founded
the company that became MCI, also sees good things ahead for his
company, but only with continued hard work and long hours _ not
even time out for a birthday celebration.
   ``I think the challenge is always in front of us,'' McGowan said
in an interview last week as the company quietly closed out its
20th year in business. Rates for MCI's various services are from 5
percent to 15 percent below those of AT&T, McGowan says.
   ``It's a tough competitive industry and we've got to stay tough
and fresh and look at it as a challenge every day,'' he said.
   ``The meek ... may inherit the Earth, but they won't increase
market share,'' McGowan said.
   That attitude is what has driven MCI, whose pioneer effort to
compete in the long-distance industry influenced the government's
decision to break up the AT&T telephone monopoly.
   MCI first took on AT&T in 1969 when it received government
approval to establish a microwave link between Chicago and St.
Louis to serve companies that had offices in both cities. It
attracted customers to its tiny network with promises of savings
over AT&T, and over the next decade the network grew as McGowan
persistently attacked the telephone monopoly in the courts and
before government regulators.
   In 1980, MCI began offering residential long-distance service,
but not until after the AT&T divestiture in January 1984 was the
company able to offer customers the same easy 1-plus dialing that
AT&T could offer. The consent decree stripped AT&T of its local
operating companies and required them to begin offering
long-distance companies the same connection to the local networks
as AT&T had long enjoyed.
   Though MCI is growing stronger, the company continues to lobby
strongly before the courts, the Federal Communications Commission
and the Congress for protection from AT&T.
   Competition in the $50 billion-a-year long-distance industry
will thrive as long as AT&T is not free to use its size to undercut
the opposition and drive competitors out of business, MCI argues.
   But AT&T says MCI wants it both ways: it wants to appear to
shareholders as a strong, confident, state-of-the art network but
it wants to appear to regulators as a struggling, vulnerable
upstart.
   ``They're trying to carry water on both shoulders,'' said
Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T vice president for marketing. ``A $5
billion company, larger than many other firms, isn't going to be
put out of business.''
   AT&T has been trying to persuade regulators, the courts and
Congress to loosen the regulatory reins on the company to allow it
to compete more freely and with more flexibility in a thriving
industry. Only AT&T is subject to regulations.
   ``It's no longer a David-and-Goliath syndrome,'' Garfinkel said.
``They are a full-fledged competitor in the marketplace and the
whole thrust of the market now is alternative competitors.''
   AT&T had 72 percent of the market last year, followed by MCI
with 9.3 percent and US Sprint Communications Co. with 5.6 percent,
according to the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.
   In contrast to MCI's financial success, US Sprint has lost $1.76
billion since it was formed in July 1986 as a joint venture of GTE
Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc.
   Analysts have watched closely as MCI has staged a steady
comeback from a tumultuous 1986 when profits were disappearing
behind price cuts it had to make to keep rates below AT&T's. MCI
cut staff by 15 percent and took a $550 million writeoff of network
assets, ending 1986 with a $448 million loss.
   In the winter of 1987, with McGowan sidelined by a heart attack,
company executives conducted a soul-searching that developed a
corporate strategy designed to lift MCI out of the doldrums and
refocus the company as a full-service company, not just a niche
player.
   McGowan, who underwent heart transplant surgery that spring,
returned to his desk and by the third quarter of that year the plan
was producing results. Costs were down and the company was making
inroads into corporate accounts and boosting its share of the
long-distance market.
   McGowan said the prescription for corporate success is a
youthful spirit that can accommodate change, especially in an
industry that has been turned inside out by regulatory changes and
technological advances.
   ``We have to make sure that we institutionalize change,''
McGowan said. ``The normal tendency is to institutionalize the
status quo. We should challenge the status quo and I would worry if
we don't.''

<HEAD>Iran Says It Is Determined To Help Achieve OPEC Unity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said Sunday it was determined to
play its part in achieving unity among members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Tehran radio reported.
   The radio report, monitored by British Broadcasting Corp., said
Oil Minister Golamreza Agazadeh made the comment during a meeting
with a delegation of officials from Oman.
   ``The achievement of a sincere unity in the decisions taken by
OPEC requires great effort and cooperation by all the members,''
Agazadeh was quoted as saying.
   ``We are determined to play our role in achieving this goal,''
he said.
   Some OPEC leaders have expressed hope that a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war could help boost oil prices.
   During the war, Iran has been discounting its oil and Iraq has
been producing far more than under its last official OPEC output
quota. In addition, disagreement by the two war enemies over how
large a quota the other should have has worsened attempts by the
fractious cartel to reach consensus on how best to raise oil prices.
   The theory is that if the war ends, Iran and Iraq will be more
disciplined.
   The world oil cartel has been attempting to raise the average
price of crude to $18 per 42-gallon barrel. Recently, world prices
have been at least $1 to $2 below that level.

<HEAD>Experts Say That Energy Companies Snapping Up Oil Reserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy companies with money to spend are snapping
up oil and gas reserves instead of sinking wells to find new
reserves, experts say.
   New oil and gas discoveries have dwindled because of high
exploration costs, but there are plenty of reserves for sale.
   ``There are more reserves on the market now than there have ever
been,'' said Houston consultant Bill Strevig. ``As an informed
guess, I'd say there is double what there was a year or two ago.''
   Strevig He calculated Saturday that reserves worth an estimated
$2.3 billion changed hands during the second quarter and he expects
a barrage of sales before 1988 is over.
   Tenneco Inc. and Texaco Inc. have the largest blocks of
properties on the market, with a combined price tag that analysts
say is in the neighborhood of $6 billion. Analysts estimate that
dozens of other companies have properties worth an additional $1.5
billion on the market.
   Consultants, analysts and the companies that are gobbling up the
reserves say current prices range from $5 to $5.50 a barrel for oil
and 80 cents to $1 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas,
although some buyers recently have paid more.
   The industry historically has valued reserves at about one-third
the price at the wellhead, so with West Texas Intermediate crude
selling at a little over $15 a barrel the market prices of $5 and
$5.50 are on target if oil and gas prices remain flat in the next
few years, Strevig said.
   According to a recent study by the accounting and consulting
firm Arthur Andersen & Co., the cost of drilling new wells is in
the range of $6 to $8 a barrel, so it is cheaper and less risky to
buy oil that already has been drilled.
   Industry experts give several reasons for selling reserves, but
the one most often cited is the seller's need to reduce debt.
   ``They look at their assets and say to themselves, `What do we
want to sell?''' said Clyde Buck, senior vice president with
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.
   ``Then they ask, `What can we get for this assets today, versus
three to five years from now?'''
   For years, companies generally had held on to their reserves,
thinking the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
eventually would succeed in driving up world energy prices, and
thus the value of their properties.
   ``The price of oil could go up dramatically, but gee whiz, it
just doesn't look like there's a high probability of that,'' Buck
said. So companies are dumping properties and putting the proceeds
into debt reduction programs and into other business sectors they
believe have more potential, he said.
   Energy companies are not the only ones buying reserves. Bill
Padek of Geodyne Resources in Tulsa, Okla., said that income
partnership funds like his, and other institutional investors such
as insurance companies and pension funds have been buying reserves.
   Energy reserve investments are suited to those organizations, he
said, because current prices are relatively low and pension funds
can afford to hold an investment with a 10- to 20-year scope.
