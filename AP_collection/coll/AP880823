<TEXT>
   In a ruling that could expand the duty of
police to protect individuals, a federal appeals court Tuesday
reinstated a suit by a woman who said officers derided her
complaints about her husband's violence and failed to help her.
   Although police normally cannot be held liable for injuries to
crime victims, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a
``special relationship'' may be created when a victim gets a
restraining order against another person and repeatedly tells
police of continuing threats.
   Restraining orders, which generally forbid a person to approach,
contact or harass another person, have become common in domestic
violence cases.
   In this case, the restraining order may have been ``an
affirmative state commitment to protect (the woman) from her
husband's harassment,'' said Judge Betty Fletcher in the 2-1
decision.
   Judge Mary Schroder concurred with Fletcher in the decision.
   In dissent, U.S. District Judge Laughlin Waters said the
existence of a restraining order created no legal right to police
protection, at least without proof that the order had been
violated. He also asked whether the court was telling police that a
person with a restraining order was entitled to ``preferred status
in terms of police response.''
   Todd Roberts, a lawyer for police in the San Mateo County
community, declined comment on the ruling.
   The woman, Jena Balistreri, said in her suit that she was
severely beaten by her husband in 1982. She said police removed her
husband from the home in Pacifica, a suburb of San Francisco, but
refused to arrest him, did not offer medical help and were rude and
unsympathetic to her complaint. She quoted one officer as saying he
didn't blame her husband because of the way she was ``carrying on.''
   The court quoted Ms. Balistreri as saying she told police
throughout 1982 about vandalism and hundreds of harassing phone
calls, and named her now-divorced husband as the suspect.
   She got a restraining order in late 1982 prohibiting her
ex-husband from contacting or harassing her. In the following
months, she said, he crashed his car into her garage and a firebomb
was thrown through her window. Police refused to arrest her
ex-husband and suggested after the firebombing that she move or
hire a private investigator, she said.
   She said police responded to her telephone complaints with
ridicule, and refused to investigate a series of harassing phone
calls she got between 1983 and 1985.
   Ms. Balistreri's suit against the Pacifica police and Chief Al
Olsen said the failure of police to protect her violated her rights
to due process and equal protection of the law and contributed to
her physical injuries, bleeding ulcer and emotional distress.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti dismissed the suit, saying
police had not violated her rights even if everything she said was
true. But the appeals court disagreed and reinstated the suit.

   Sikh extremists fatally shot 15 people,
including a member of the governing Congress Party, and wounded
three policemen in the northern state of Punjab, news reports said
Tuesday.
   The deaths raised to more than 1,750 the known number of people
killed this year by militant Sikh separatists. More than half of
the victims have been Sikhs and most of the others Hindus.
   Joginder Singh Bhatti, a municipal commissioner of Jandiala town
and a member of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party, was
slain by gunmen in Jandiala, according to reports from Punjab.
   News reports from the state gave these accounts of the other
attacks:
   A truck rigged with a bomb exploded in Amritsar district,
seriously wounding three policemen.
   Three moderate Sikhs were killed by extremists in the village of
Timowal near Amritsar, the Sikhs' holy city.
   A farmer and his son were slain in Amritsar district,.
   In adjoining Gurdaspur district a woman and three men were
killed.
   A Hindu girl was killed and robbed of her money and jewelry.
   The bodies of four Sikh youths believed to have been killed late
Monday were found by police near the village of Mamanke in Amritsar
district.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's population of 800
million but form a majority in Punjab state. Militants, claiming
discrimination by the Hindu majority, have been fighting for a
separate state in the Punjab since 1982.
   Officials say at least 4,500 people have been killed in the
Punjab-related violence during the past six years.

Tuesday that William N. ``Red'' King, who died Saturday at the age
of 71, was the nation's first paratrooper.

   A Chinese army veteran committed suicide because
he was unable to pay the bribes needed to obtain a good job, an
official daily reported today.
   Wang Zhilong, who was looking for civilian work after 20 years
in the army, jumped to his death on July 27 from the fifth floor of
a hospital in central China's Luoyang City, the China Daily said.
   Wang had been hospitalized after trying to kill himself three
days earlier by touching electric wires.
   The report said Wang became depressed after a local Communist
Party official, Li Shiyi, demanded a color TV, a bicycle and
name-brand cigarettes and liquor as preconditions for arranging a
job.
   It said Wang spent his life savings of $810, more than double a
worker's annual salary, on the gifts, but was still unable to
satisfy the corrupt official.
   It said Wang's suicide surprised local party and government
officials and a joint team was formed to investigate the death and
punish those responsible.
   The ruling Communist Party in recent months has issued stern
warnings about official corruption, which has become increasingly
serious as the nation's market-oriented economic reforms loosen
state controls.
   Influence-peddling, always a part of doing business in China,
has been joined by widespread black marketeering, hoarding,
extortion and graft.
   The daily said that in Henan province, where Luoyang is located,
prosecutors handled 589 corruption cases involving 246 government
employees in the first six months of this year.

   Sharp differences between allies and foes
of Syria _ Lebanon's main power broker _ over the election of a new
president threaten to rekindle this country's bloody 13-year war
between Moslems and Christians.
   ``Lebanon's fate is at stake,'' Parliamentary deputy Joseph
Skaff, a Christian, said this week.
   Parliamentary deputies representing the 80 percent of Lebanon
controlled by Syria and its Moslem militia allies want a president
willing to crush Syria's main foe, the right-wing Lebanese Forces.
   The Lebanese Forces is the Christians' main militia. It has
links with Israel and is blocking re-election of former president
Suleiman Franjieh, a Christian branded by political rivals as
``Syria's candidate.''
   Franjieh, 78, governed from 1970 to 1976. He is the front-runner
in a lackluster field of candidates that includes Dany Chamoun, son
of the late Camille Chamoun, another former president.
   Behind the friction lie old hatreds.
   Franjieh holds Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea responsible
for killing his son Tony, Tony's wife and 3-year-old daughter along
with 30 others in a raid on the family's summer mansion in June
1978.
   Geagea opposes Syria's strategy of seeking political reforms
that would give Moslems equal power with the Christians, who have
dominated the government, judiciary and army since independence
from France in 1943.
   Back then, the Christians were considered the majority.
   Now, Moslems comprise about 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million
people and Christians make up 45 percent.
   Last month, just 38 of the 76 members of Parliament attended a
session to elect a new president, far short of the quorum needed.
   All but two of the deputies who turned up were Moslems. They
accused the Lebanese Forces of physically preventing Christian
deputies from attending. No date for a new session has been set.
   There have been no parliamentary elections in Lebanon since
1972. The 99-seat house has simply renewed its mandate every two
years.
   The Lebanese Forces pledged: ``There will be no quorum so long
as Franjieh is a candidate.'' But the Syrians declared they still
back Franjieh.
   ``Syria's staunch support for Franjieh against local, regional
and international powers is a very risky move that could plunge
Lebanon into all-out violence,'' a foreign diplomat said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   A Moslem politician, who asked not to be identified, said: ``If
the spirit of challenge persists, we might not have a president by
Sept. 23.''
   That's when the six-year term of the incumbent president,
Maronite Catholic Amin Gemayel, expires. Under constitutional
rules, Gemayel, 46, cannot run again for a consecutive second term.
   The politician noted: ``Franjieh, whether candidate or
president, means war. If elected, he'll launch war on the Lebanese
Forces, and if not elected, he'll launch war on them.''
   After more than a decade of war and the fragmentation of Lebanon
into a cluster of sectarian cantons, Gemayel's authority is limited
to his own stronghold in the Metn mountains.
   The Lebanese Forces control the rest of the shrunken Christian
enclave.
   Syria and its Moslem allies have boycotted Gemayel for 2{ years,
since he torpedoed a Syrian-brokered peace accord under which the
Christians would surrender some of their power.
   Despite their differences, most Lebanese factions believe a
constitutional vacuum will be disastrous.
   Under an unwritten national covenant, dating back to
independence, the president has to be a Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni Moslem and the House speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily said Gemayel would form an
interim government headed by a Maronite prime minister if a
president is not elected before Sept. 23.
   The 1943 covenant allows a Maronite to be named prime minister
if the presidential post is vacant.
   But 10 Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions warned they
will prevent such a government from running the country.
   Outside of Franjieh, a warlord whose private army controls north
Lebanon, none of the other half-dozen Christian contenders is
considered to have much of a chance.
   The Syrians, angered by last week's parliamentary fiasco, have
accused the Americans of seeking to sabotage Franjieh's election
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy, asked about
Parliament's failure to achieve a quorum, said in New York: ``When
there's a better understanding among the deputies as to likely
consensus candidates, I'm sure a quorum will be arranged.''
   But with Lebanon sliding ever deeper into political limbo, with
both sides digging in, the prospects of that look slim.

   After 19 years of painstaking effort, workers
are only now making headway in repairing the damage caused when an
Australian sheep shearer set fire to Al Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's
holiest monuments.
   Precarious wooden scaffolding towers into the dome. Laborers are
still cleaning fire-blackened stone behind the pulpit while skilled
craftsmen are carefully reconstructing mosaic panels with
inscriptions from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Isam Awad, the Palestinian engineer in charge of the project,
blames lost skills and modern politics for the slowness of the work.
   ``The fire damaged some of the oldest parts of the mosque.
Suddenly, we had to work with gypsum, mosaics, stucco and lead. All
these were lost skills, and we had to find people who knew and
relearn them,'' said Awad, who supervises a team of 40 workers.
   Al Aqsa, which marks the place where the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven to receive the word of God, was built in the 7th
century after the Caliph Omar conquered Jerusalem. It is considered
Islam's third holiest site after Mecca and Medina.
   The 36-acre site known in Arabic as the Haram Al Sharif (Noble
Enclosure), was originally the site of the Jewish Temple, built by
King Herod and destroyed by the Roman Tenth Legion in 70 A.D.
   Awad said the renovations for the mosque and the nearby Dome of
the Rock have been slowed by the Arab-Israeli conflict. ``We have
to be careful because of politics.''
   Awad added that the recent decision of Jordan's King Hussein to
sever ties with the West Bank put question marks on whether money
would still be available for the restoration. He said more than
$1.5 million had been spent so far on fixing damage from the fire.
   Awad said repeated strikes and boycotts by Palestinians
protesting Israeli occupation on the West Bank made it impossible
to complete the change from the mosque's gold-tinted aluminum dome
to a new a reddish-hued copper top before rains start in September.
   Perhaps the greatest loss in the fire, which took hours to put
out, was a carved wooden ``mindab,'' or pulpit, presented to the
mosque by Saladin, the Moslem warrior who defeated the Christian
Crusaders in the 11th century A.D.
   Replacing the pulpit requires special woodworking skills
unavailable locally. A number of countries are vying for the honor
of carrying out the work, but choosing one country over the other
is proving to be a delicate political exercise.
   Officials of the Waqf, the Jordanian-funded Moslem trust that
oversees the Al Aqsa complex, said Turkey or Egypt would probably
be awarded the job of reconstructing the pulpit.
   On April 21, 1969, Moslem guards spotted flames coming from Al
Aqsa. The fire burned out of control for hours with flames reaching
the windows just below the dome.
   Israeli authorities arrested Michael Denis William Rohen, a tall
blond sheep-shearer from Sydney, Australia, who belonged to the
Protestant Church of God sect. He was judged insane and deported to
Australia.
   Hassan Tahboub, a member of the Moslem Supreme Council in
Jerusalem, questions whether the act was the work of a deranged
individual.
   He said Moslem investigators believed a group may have been
involved because Rohen called London the night before the attack
and may have received instructions. But Tahboub added, ``We refused
to give evidence to the Israelis because we considered the court to
be illegal.''
   Much of the fire damage has now been repaired, including about
75 feet of Fatamid-style mosaics, 750 square feet of gypsum
moldings, 30 new stain glass windows and new marble columns.
   The most painstaking work is being done by Adel Jabari, 38, who
said it took two months to place the 20,000 pieces of glass and
stone in each square meter (0.76 square feet) of mosaic.
   Some of his work represents new designs inspired by Jabari's
stay in Italy, where he was sent to study restoration methods and
became enthused with the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
   ``I was inspired by the spirit of Michelangelo,'' said Jabari.
   Cleaning fire-blackened stone and mosaic panels behind the
pulpit, restoring some decorations in the Al Aqsa dome's interior
and building a new pulpit remain to be done.
   Awad declines to predict when work will be complete, noting the
mission has expanded to include other repairs needed because of age
and neglect.
   ``It is a lifetime job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former Commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center Dead At 56</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maj. Gen. Lewis Apsey Mologne, an army
physician who became the commander of Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, died of cancer Monday at Walter Reed. He was 56.
   Mologne in 1983 took over administration of Walter Reed, the
military's central hospital facility in Washington, and was
credited with restoring morale following a period in which three
commanders had left within five years.
   He was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his
leadership at Walter Reed.
   When Mologne became commander, Walter Reed and the military
medical establishment had been plagued by revelations about
incompetent physicians, inaccuracies in drug testing, the theft of
drugs and unpaid bills.
   Mologne instituted new procurement systems, streamlined
paperwork, worked with city police on the drug theft problem and
reorganized the military's urinalysis laboratory at Fort Meade in
Maryland.
   Mologne, who was born in Mount Pleasant, Pa., retired from the
military on Aug. 1.
   He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.,
and was commissioned in the Army Corps of Engineers. He also
graduated from the Airborne School at Fort Benning, Ga.
   He was a company commander in Korea as a young officer and
resigned from the Army to attend medical school at the University
of Pittsburgh. He was commissioned in the Army Medical Corps after
graduation and later worked as a surgeon, administrator and medical
professor.
   His posts included chief surgeon and deputy commander at
Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Colorado, and head of the Army
Medical Command in South Korea. He was chief of medical corps
affairs and professional services director in the U.S. Surgeon
General's office from 1982 until he became commander at Walter Reed.
   Survivors include his wife, Rose Marie, of Washington.

   The fourth visit by Freddy of ``Nightmare On
Elm Street'' was worth nearly $13 million, while the average
box-office take by ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' was cut nearly
in half as it doubled its distribution.
   ``Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,'' earned $12.8
million last weekend for New Line films, the biggest opening this
summer by a movie not distributed by a large studio.
   No. 2 was ``Young Guns'' with $5 million.
   The only other debut movie to make the top 10 last weekend was
``Married To The Mob,'' in seventh place with $3.2 million.
   ``The Last Temptation,'' which was not among the top 10 because
of its limited distribution, doubled its screens to 18 in the
United States and Canada. But its take as the box office softened
with $476,623, or $26,459 per theater. That compared to last week's
$44,579 per screen for a three-day total of $401,211 on nine
screens.
   In third place last week was ``Die Hard,'' with $4.5 million,
followed by ``A Fish Called Wanda'' with $4.4 million; ``Cocktail''
in fifth place with $4 million and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in
sixth place with $3.6 million.
   ``Married To The Mob,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer as a woman
widowed after her hit-man husband is done in by his boss, was next.
   At No. 8 was ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' with $2.7
million, followed by ``Coming To America'' with $2.5 million and
``Midnight Run'' in the 10th with $2.1 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in

<HEAD>Shootout Outside Restaurant Where Ramos Entertained Korean
Politician</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with no one killed as earlier
reported; charges filed against gunmen identified as civilian
intelligence agents, new quotes and details.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civilian security agents and
bodyguards fought a gun battle Monday outside a restaurant where
South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung was attending a dinner
with Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.
   Neither Kim nor Ramos was injured in the shooting. Officials
said early Tuesday that no one was killed, although it had been
reported Monday that one of the security agents had been slain.
   They said two of Ramos' bodyguards were wounded and one of the
agents, Jefferson Bautista, was in critical condition Tuesday with
a bullet in the head.
   Police Lt. Jack Nayra said Tuesday he filed attempted murder
charges against the three intelligence agents who allegedly started
the shooting after a shouting match with other motorists blocked in
a traffic jam outside the restaurant.
   Others attending the dinner in the Korean Garden Restaurant at
the time of the gunfight included Rep. Ramon Mitra, the speaker of
the House of Representatives; Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus;
Sen. Agapito Aquino, and Sen. Heherson Alvarez.
   Kim remained inside the restaurant during the incident. Before
leaving Tuesday for Seoul, he told reporters he was ``praying that
peace can be restored in your country.''
   Ramos said late Monday that the shooting was not politically
motivated but was ``a simple traffic problem that evolved into a
shooting incident.''
   Ramos said he and other guests arrived at the restaurant Monday
evening. Their cars and those of their bodyguards bottled up
traffic on the narrow street in front of the restaurant in Makati,
the capital's financial center.
   Nayra said that Bautista and his two companions, a man and a
woman, were in a car that got stuck in the jam. Soon they were
yelling at other motorists, Nayra reported witnesses as saying.
   He said someone in Bautista's car fired at one of the cars
parked near the restaurant and Ramos' bodyguards shot back.
   Nayra said Bautista and his companions were civilian agents of
the Philippine Constabulary's counter-intelligence unit. Agents are
normally authorized to carry firearms.
   ``About 9:15 or 9:20, we heard some shots,'' Ramos said. ``So
after advising everyone inside to keep calm, I went outside to take
a look.... I shouted at everybody to keep calm and stop shooting.''
   Ramos said the party continued after the incident. He said he
later escorted Kim and his wife to their hotel and then reported to
President Corazon Aquino that the Kims were safe.
   ``I think we are trying to show our guest that in the
Philippines, this is not a cowboy town,'' Ramos said.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, Manila's highest police officer,
had said late Monday that Bautista had died and he had ordered the
body transferred to the constabulary's criminal laboratory for an
autopsy. Authorities at the Makati Medical Center said Tuesday that
Bautista was alive but in critical condition.
   They refused to give other details.
   Kim, leader of the Party of Peace and Democracy, was invited to
the Philipphines by the Aquino family to attend ceremonies Sunday
marking the fifth anniversary of the slaying of Mrs. Aquino's
husband, Benigno Aquino Jr.
   On Monday, Aguirre identified one of the other agents arrested
as Ronaldo Teodoro. He said the woman who was arrested remained in
the car throughout the shooting.

   A jogger chased an escaped kangaroo back
into the arms of waiting zookeepers after mistaking the animal for
a dog when he heard it moving in a ditch.
   Ken Torkelson was running Sunday in a park near the Dakota Zoo
when he heard the noise.
   ``I had been chased by a dog the day before, so I just assumed
it was another dog, so I looked down for something to throw at
it,'' Torkelson said.
   To his amazement, he said, he discovered that the animal was a
kangaroo.
   Torkelson said he assumed the kangaroo had escaped from the zoo.
Worried it would get into traffic, he blocked its path and
gradually chased it back toward the zoo.
   ``We'd each go full tilt for 100 yards and then it would stop. I
don't know if it was resting or re-evaluating or what, but
naturally I was resting,'' he said.
   Zoo spokesman Terry Lincoln says it isn't known how the animal
escaped Sunday morning, but it was not hurt.

   The offices of the prosecutor
investigating alleged fraud in Pentagon contracting were
burglarized, but the intruders did not obtain any confidential
information or files on criminal investigations, police said Monday.
   Alexandria police spokesman Officer Dennis Butler said about six
suites on the fifth floor of an office building were burglarized
between 9:30 p.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday. The offices included
those of a private law firm and of the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Virginia.
   The law firm and the U.S. attorney's office told police that two
videocassette recorders and a television set were missing.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson is leading a highly publicized
investigation into allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for potentially lucrative details on contracts.
   A spokesman for Hudson said none of the burglarized offices
contained confidential or sensitive information, which is kept in a
more secure part of the building.

   They plunder Etruscan tombs in the dead
of night, loot ancient Greek statues from archaeological digs and
steal priceless works from museums and churches.
   Officials say thieves and ``tombaroli'' _ grave robbers _ are
sacking Italy's art treasures at the rate of 130 objects a day.
Experts say there's little that can be done to stop it.
   Only a fraction of the artworks are recovered, and some of the
most valuable wind up in the United States.
   For example, a 5th century B.C. Greek statue now on display at
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. was allegedly stolen in
Italy.
   Italian authorities say the case of the 7{-foot Getty statue,
allegedly taken from an illegal excavation in Sicily, is just one
slice of a thriving multi-million dollar business involving
thieves-for-hire, shady middlemen and wealthy collectors.
   According to figures compiled by a special Carabinieri art-theft
squad, 1,466 robberies involving the loss of 23,128 art objects
were reported in the first half of 1988. About half of the thefts
were from churches, which generally have little security.
   Authorities recovered 8,469 stolen objects and made 417 arrests
during the six months.
   The figures do not include artifacts illegally unearthed in
places such as Cerveteri, 30 miles north of Rome, site of one of
the most important Etruscan cemeteries in Italy.
   ``The situation in Cerveteri is dramatic and catastrophic,''
said archaeologist Daniela Rizzo, who monitors the problem in
Etruria, the region north of Rome where the Etruscan civilization
thrived from the 8th century to 4th century B.C.
   Cerveteri was at the center of one of the biggest art scandals
in decades. A 6th century B.C. terracotta vase by the Greek artist
Euphronius, known as the calyx krater, was bought in 1972 by New
York's Metropolitan Museum, where it remains. Italian authorities
want the vase back, claiming it was removed from Cerveteri in 1971,
illegally sold and smuggled to the United States.
   The 670-acre Cerveteri cemetery, like the tombs in nearby
Tarquinia and Vulci, is a prime hunting ground for tombaroli. They
locate unexcavated tombs during the day, using long pointed rods to
probe the earth, and return at night to dig up pots, vases and
tombs.
   ``The damage is incalculable,'' said Ms. Rizzo, flipping through
a stack of reports on recent illegal excavations in the area.
``It's not just the loss of the items, but the damage to the tomb
itself that is devastating.''
   Italian police now use helicopters and mounted patrols to watch
archaeological zones, and motorboats help track undersea treasure
hunters.
   ``It's difficult to stop these illegal excavations because all
of Italy is covered by archaeological sites. Many of these are in
isolated areas where it is impossible to maintain surveillance,''
said a senior Carabinieri investigator, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   In Tarquinia and Vulci, the government has posted hired guards
since October 1987, when floods uncovered unexcavated tombs. In
April, four tombaroli in Tarquinia were caught and arrested after a
chase through the cemetery.
   ``It's possible to put a brake on the tomb robberies, but it's
impossible to stop it,'' said Paola Pelagatti, the archaeological
superintendent for southern Etruria. ``We need more means, money
and personnel.''
   Tombaroli are only one part of a sophisticated network. Many
artworks are stolen on commission to meet orders from rich
collectors in Italy and abroad.
   Ms. Rizzo said many stolen Etruscan artifacts are smuggled into
neighboring Switzerland, where it is easy to obtain papers showing
legal ownership. Many pieces then are brought back into Italy,
winding up in Rome's antique shops.
   Tombaroli are also active in southern Italy and Sicily. Italian
authorities suspect an illegal dig in Morgantina, Sicily, in 1979
yielded the magnificent Greek statue that recently went on display
at the Getty Museum. An Italian magistrate and Interpol are
investigating the origin of the statue, believed to be of the
goddess Aphrodite and valued at $20 million.
   Getty said it checked with the Italian government before
displaying the work, which it said it received on loan from a
private collector.
   Some people in Italy, after seeing pictures of the Getty statue,
have questioned its authenticity. But no one in Italy has
determined it is a fake.
   Ms. Rizzo believes one way to stop the plunder would be to
create a legal, open market for trade in archaeological objects.
   ``This would reduce the activity of the grave robbers,'' she
said. ``But right now what we need is more cooperation from abroad,
especially from those countries who don't have the ancient history
of Italy and tend to accept the material _ legal or illegal.''

   Rudely awakened neighbors crowing about
Jose Sanchez's vocal 15-pound rooster won a court victory when the
owner was convicted of illegally harboring the animal in a
residential area.
   Sanchez may now find himself in jail because of the pet Rhode
Island Red rooster named Travis, who ruffled too many feathers with
his predawn wakeup calls in the tranquil neighborhood 35 miles east
of Los Angeles.
   Sanchez, 26, who fought the city over its anti-rooster law for
two years was convicted Monday on four misdemeanor counts. He could
be ordered to serve six months in jail and pay a $1,000 fine for
each count.
   Sentencing is scheduled Sept. 23.
   Deputy City Attorney Frank Rhemrev said he doubts the maximum
sentence will be assessed.
   ``Can you believe it? I might end up in county jail with
burglars and thieves. And I'll be there because of a chicken,''
Sanchez said before Monday's decision.
   Many people have told Sanchez he shouldn't risk going up the
river for a rooster, but he remained adamant.
   ``You can get warm and cuddly about a rooster just like you can
about a cat or a dog,'' Sanchez said. ``Travis is real friendly...
He's a companion, just like any other pet.
   ``He just happens to be a chicken,'' he said of the 7-year-old
bird.
   Rhemrev said neighbors began complaining about the rooster calls
in 1986.
   Sanchez said he thinks the 1984 law banning roosters, but not
hens, is wrong, and vowed to ``go all the way'' for his bird, even
if it means jail.
   The pet owner said because Travis was 3 years old and living in
his backyard when the law was passed, the rooster should be the
beneficiary of a grandfather clause.

   The use of a properly trained police dog to
seize a felony suspect does not constitute deadly force under the
law, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling in favor of the
Nashville, Tenn., metropolitan government in the July 1984 death of
a man suspected of robbing a business who died after he was bitten
in the neck by a police dog.
   Nashville police investigator Ronnie Barnes said he released his
police dog Casey into the building after twice calling out to warn
suspect Daniel Briggs to surrender or face the dog.
   Barnes said he found Briggs' neck in the dog's mouth. Briggs did
not move and was later pronounced dead on arrival at a Nashville
hospital, police said.
   Dorothy Robinette, administrator of Briggs' estate, sued Barnes,
the metropolitan Nashville government and Police Chief Joe Casey,
charging that use of the police dog amounted to unnecessary deadly
force in violation of Briggs' constitutional rights.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Wiseman of Nashville dismissed her
lawsuit and ruled in Nashville's favor, leading to the appeal.
   Barnes and his police dog were trained according to national
standards established by the U.S. Police Canine Association and
have participated in periodic retraining programs since January
1984, Nashville police said.

   One man, one vote, one vice presidential
candidate, and George Bush has chosen himself a problem _ a
distraction from the themes of his Republican campaign for the
White House.
   It may be unfair. It may be, as Bush supporters contend, a
creation of the news media. But the Dan Quayle issue is undeniably
a campaign detour just when the Republicans wanted to build on the
sendoff of their national convention pageantry.
   That's a problem for Bush and his strategists, and for Sen.
Quayle, who can hardly be enjoying his new line of work very much.
It has brought him denunciations and ridicule. He is in fact an
intelligent man who works diligently, if selectively, on his
legislative issues. He got less than a day to celebrate his sudden
leap from junior senator to vice presidential nominee. Then the
nagging, persistent questions about his military service and now
his educational record emerged to divert the GOP running mates from
their chosen agenda.
   Instead of taking the offense coming out of New Orleans, Bush
and Quayle find themselves snarled in a damage control operation.
The question is whether and when it will end.
   According to a friend of the vice president, one who watched him
make his vice presidential selection, Bush chose Quayle on his own,
with minimal input from his advisers.
   James A. Baker III, who resigned as secretary of the treasury to
run the Bush campaign, was said to have been opposed to the
selection of Quayle before it was announced. He has since been a
loyal supporter, although hardly a cheerleader.
   Quayle, 41, was supposed to be the fresh face, the man who would
symbolize the Republican future, a young conservative with no
political baggage. He was picked to offer a positive comparison to
the Democratic nominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, 67, who has
his own political scars, notably the admitted blunder of setting up
a high-priced breakfast club at which lobbyist-donors would dine
with the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Bentsen called
that off after his fund-raising plan was disclosed.
   His refunds and apology quashed the issue. By the time Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, picked him
for the ticket, it was history.
   Not so with Quayle, who was fresh, new business in New Orleans
when he began by fumbling early questions about the way he got into
the Indiana National Guard in 1969. His student deferment was
expiring and the Guard was a sought-after alternative to the draft
and the likelihood of duty in the Vietnam War. The question still
pending is whether the influence of his newspaper-owning family got
him a Guard slot or whether, as Quayle insists, the unit he joined
was seeking recruits for vacancies.
   Quayle joined the Guard when his student deferment was about to
lapse with his graduation from college.
   Dukakis was draft-deferred as a student during the Korean war.
He volunteered for the draft prior to his graduation in 1955 and
served just under two years in the Army.
   He said the Quayle matter would be an election issue. ``How we
make our decisions, how we make the presidential selections, who we
select . . . whether or not that person should be a heartbeat away
from the presidency, obviously will be an issue,'' he said.
   Bush said the matter should subside. After all, not many people
vote on the basis of vice presidential nominations. The contest is
between two men, the presidential nominees.
   After a weekend of campaigning _ defensively _ with Bush, Quayle
went back to Washington for some basic training on national
politics. Bush said his running mate had to get his staff, schedule
and personal affairs organized. ``This hit him out of a clear, blue
sky,'' Bush said.
   That's part of the problem.
   A system that subjects presidential candidates to almost
inhumane scrutiny doesn't do a thing to check out the vice
presidential nominees. One man, the nominee, gets to pick the vice
presidential half of the ticket, by fiat.
   To compound the problem, presidential candidates act as though
choosing a running mate is a piece of business that has to be left
for the last minute.
   Bush has known since late last winter, when his presidential
nomination was assured, that he would need a running mate. He even
knew the deadline: Aug. 18.
   There was time for a careful, thorough search of the field and
for close scrutiny of the people in that field. That kind of search
might have led Bush to the same conclusion _ Dan Quayle. But he
would have known the man and the record. The time and the resources
were there to avoid unpleasant surprises, for Bush and for Quayle,
who obviously didn't see anything like this in his two campaigns
for the House and two for the Senate.
   Then, too, it's just possible that in the case of the vice
presidency, the choice shouldn't be one vote by one man.
   Despite the often-repeated fact that no incumbent vice president
since Martin Van Buren in 1836 has been elected president, being
No. 2 is a very good way to become No. 1. Thirteen of the 43 men
who have served as vice president eventually have become president.
   Those are better White House odds than you'll get in any other
line of work.

<HEAD>GOP Leaders Try to Dismiss Quayle Flap, but Worry About Choice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican leaders are trying to dismiss the
flap over vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle as ``much ado about
nothing,'' but many also are questioning whether George Bush made
the best possible choice for a running mate.
   ``I think Quayle should assess and if he feels like he's hurting
the ticket, he ought to be man enough to step aside,'' Tommy
Thomas, chairman of the Bush steering committee in Florida, said
Monday.
   ``This thing has to be over before Labor Day, one way or the
other,'' said Thomas, who joined the Marines in World War II on his
17th birthday.
   When Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey was asked if he had any
reservations about Quayle as a potential president, he replied, ``I
want to get to know a lot more about him.''
   Gov. John R. McKernan of Maine said that when Quayle's name
first surfaced at the Republican National Convention as a possible
Bush choice ``I said I thought it would be a mistake. ... And,
unfortunately, I've been borne out to be right.''
   Kean, who delivered the keynote address at the GOP convention,
said this was Quayle's first time on the national stage.
   ``It's not unusual that he may make a few mistakes, but you
don't make them two or three times, you make them and you move
on,'' said the New Jersey governor. ``We have yet to see whether or
not he grows into the stature that the vice presidential candidate
should have.''
   Georgia GOP chairman John Stuckey said, ``Personally speaking,
there are other people I think who would have made a better vice
presidential selection, but that wasn't my decision to make.''
   Questions have centered on whether Quayle used his wealthy
family's connections to avoid being drafted for combat in Vietnam.
   At the height of the Vietnam War in 1969, Quayle was called by
his local draft board for a pre-induction physical. Before he could
be drafted, however, he joined the Indiana National Guard. A former
employee of one of the newspapers owned by Quayle's family has said
he interceded with the Guard on Quayle's behalf.
   Quayle's admission to law school also has drawn attention. He
was admitted to Indiana University Law School in 1970 despite being
by his own admission ``a proverbial C-plus student'' in college.
   First rejected for admission, Quayle was admitted after meeting
with the admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where
Quayle's family owned the local newspaper.
   While few Republicans went as far as Thomas in suggesting that
Quayle ought to consider quitting the ticket, some Republicans were
wary that there could be additional disclosures.
   Asked if he thought Bush should consider dropping Quayle, House
GOP leader Bob Michel of Illinois, said, ``If there was something
additional that came up that was a distraction or disqualification,
well, the option's always there. But I don't see it at this
juncture.''
   ``Everybody's kind of waiting to see if there's anything else
out there,'' said Michelle Davis, executive director of the
Republican Governors Association. She called the questions about
Quayle's military service and law school admission ``mere ruffles''
and said, ``If this is all there is to be had, that ain't bad.''
   But even Republicans who expressed second thoughts about the
choice of Quayle stood behind the vice presidential nominee and
rejected suggestions he be dropped from the ticket.
   ``From what I can tell, he is going to survive this,'' said
McKernan, who described his initial hesitation as based on a belief
that ``the problem with picking an unknown is that everyone puts
that person under a microscope and you lose some momentum that you
would otherwise have.''
   ``It seems to me much ado about, if not nothing, at least, very
little,'' said Stuckey. He called the controversy about Quayle's
military record ``a bit overblown.''
   ``Much ado about nothing,'' was how Virginia GOP chairman Donald
W. Huffman described the controversy.
   Several Republicans blamed the media for the controversy.
   ``Seven out of 10 people feel it is a media hype created by the
media for the media,'' said John Stabile, New Hampshire GOP
chairman.
   ``It is a media-driven issue,'' said Fred Logan Jr., Kansas
Republican Party chairman. ``I think if the press continues to push
it, there's going to be an enormous backlash in favor of Quayle.''
   ``It's been blown totally out of proportion,'' said Burton
Kruglick, Arizona Republican chairman. ``There's been nothing
proved that anything was done wrong.''

<HEAD>Congressional Study Says Improvements to B-1 Bomber Could Cost
$3.4 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has a number of options if it
wants to improve the B-1 bomber, and some of the plans could cost
up to $3.4 billion, according to a report by the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office.
   The CBO report released Monday was the newest entry in the long
debate over the plane, which is defended by the Air Force and
attacked by critics who say it can't do the job for which it was
designed.
   A chief critic is Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, who said the study would be ``a primer
for the debate to come on the expensive airplane's future.''
   ``We have to decide first if it's worth it to fix the B-1B's
problems and then we have to decide what, if anything, to do about
the expected Air Force requests for enhancements,'' Aspin said in a
statement.
   Two weeks ago, Aspin said it might be necessary to halt spending
on the bomber rather than pay for expensive repairs.
   But the Air Force saw the report in a different light.
   Capt. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for the service, said, ``The CBO
addresses a shopping list of possible enhancements, the vast
majority of which were not requested by the Air Force. We
constantly evaluate all systems, including the B-1B, for their
ability to meet evolving threats and request enhancements as
necessary.''
   The B-1's chief problems concern electronic counter-measures,
the highly sophisticated system used to defend the plane against
attack.
   Aspin and other critics say there are questions about whether
the B-1 could perform adequately its mission of flying into the
Soviet Union and delivering a load of nuclear bombs. But the Air
Force says the B-1 will be a success.
   The CBO noted that ``a sophisticated weapons system like the
B-1B bomber is never really complete. Even as the Air Force seeks
to correct problems in the original B-1B design, the service is
considering enhancements to improve the bomber's capability.''
   The CBO study spelled out four possibilities. One would improve
B-1 navigation and communications and redesign other electronic
systems and would cost between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion.
   Another choice, the CBO said, is simply to outfit the B-1 to
carry long-range cruise missiles, meaning the plane would never
have to enter the Soviet Union. That would cost $90 million.
   The third option, costing up to $3.4 billion, chiefly consists
of new electronics for jamming or deceiving enemy radars.
   A fourth choice involves purchasing different electronics and
would cost $2.7 billion.
   President Carter killed the B-1 in 1977, but President Reagan
resurrected it four years later.
   The Air Force has bought 100 B-1s and will use the plane in
conjunction with the so-called ``stealth'' B-2 bomber as the B-52
replacement in the nation's arsenal of long-range atomic weapons.
The B-2, nicknamed ``stealth'' for its capability to evade enemy
air defenses, will have its first public flight in November.
   The last B-1 was delivered April 30. The Air Force said the
total cost of the program was $27.3 billion, but that figure
doesn't include any improvements.

   The USS Stark, blown apart at midship by two
Iraqi missiles 15 months ago, has been repaired at a Mississippi
shipyard and will be returned to the Navy in two weeks.
   The guided-missile frigate has been laid up at the yards of
Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., since last November. It
is scheduled for sea trials Aug. 29 and 30 and then final delivery
to the Navy, said Lt. Barbara Kent, a Navy spokeswoman.
   Although the cost of repairs has not been tallied precisely, the
U.S. government is preparing to submit a bill to Iraq for the
damage. The Navy and Ingalls managed to hold the repair costs
``under $90 million compared to an original repair estimate of $142
million,'' Kent said.
   Iraq has accepted responsibility for the attack on the Stark,
describing the May 17, 1987, incident as a case of mistaken
identity. It has promised to compensate the United States and the
relatives of the 37 sailors who died in the attack, although no
money has changed hands to date.
   The Stark was almost lost as a result of the night-time attack.
An Iraqi Mirage jet fighter fired two Exocet missiles at the ship,
both of which struck although only one exploded.
   The fuel from the first, unexploded Exocet contributed to a fire
that produced temperatures as hot as 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit,
starting an inferno that has been described as unique in naval
warfare. The blaze was so intense it literally ``cooked'' the decks
above, spontaneously igniting equipment in those upper decks and
spreading the fire vertically rather than horizontally.
   Ultimately, the fire destroyed the entire Combat Information
Center _ the electronic heart of the ship _ as well as crew berths,
radar equipment rooms and other compartments.
   In repairing the ship, Ingalls had to cut the front half of the
old superstructure away and replace it, along with a 50-foot
section of the steel hull down to the second level below the main
deck.
   Inside the superstructure, Ingalls installed a new computerized
combat system built by the Unisys Corp.
   According to Kent, the Stark's crew has almost completely
changed due to routine rotations since the ship returned from the
Persian Gulf. The new crew is grooming the ship for its return to
the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and its home port in Mayport, Fla., she
added.
   ``Aug. 31 is still our completion date,'' the spokeswoman said.
``We're on schedule and running under cost.''

<HEAD>Study: American Youth `Staying Younger Longer'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's young people are the most educated
in history but not necessarily the best educated, and they're
taking longer to become self-supporting adults, a new government
report indicates.
   Assistant Education Secretary Chester E. Finn Jr., who released
the report Monday, said the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds
living with parents increased from 43 percent in 1960 to 53.6
percent in 1985.
   ``American young people seem to be staying younger longer,'' he
said. ``They seem to be becoming autonomous, self-supporting
individuals at a slower rate than was once the case.''
   The report, entitled ``Youth Indicators 1988,'' was compiled
from existing data dating back to 1950 from federal agencies and
private organizations.
   During that time, the percentage of college graduates among
Americans age 25 to 29 increased from 7.7 percent in 1950 to 22.4
per cent in 1986. The 1986 total of those with some college, 44
percent, is greater than the percentage with only a high school
education, 42.1 percent, for the first time in U.S. history.
   But Finn said falling SAT and ACT scores, plus the last-place
ranking of U.S. students in recent international science and
mathematics tests, are reason for concern.
   ``I have to say that while a lot more kids are getting more
education measured in the number of years of schooling, they don't
know very much,'' he said. ``They make me worry about the future of
a country that's raising up people with a number of years in school
but that don't know anything.''
   The 134-page report was prepared by the department's Office of
Educational Research and Improvement.
   Among other findings:
   _Median income for women aged 20 to 24 fell from $12,517 in 1980
to $12,192 in 1986, using constant 1986 dollars. The comparable
figures for young men fell from $16,113 in 1970 to $14,152 in 1986.
   _The number of first marriages per 1,000 never-married women
aged 20 to 24 fell from 220.1 in 1970 to 104.4 in 1984.
   The study said the trends may be related, since ``late marriage
is a reasonable response to lower earnings.''
   It added that ``living with parents is a reasonable arrangement
for those not earning enough to support themselves.''

   Gulf Air, which stopped flying to the
capitals of Iran and Iraq when war broke out between the two
nations, plans to resume the lucrative routes, Bahrain's Gulf News
Agency reported.
   The carrier _ owned by Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the Abu Dhabi
province of the United Arab Emirates _ stopped flights to Baghdad
and Tehran like most other airlines shortly after the war began in
September 1980.
   The Gulf News Agency said in a dispatch Monday that flight
schedules will be fixed once the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire appears
stable.
   The cease-fire took hold Saturday, but both sides have accused
the other of violations. Iran and Iraq are scheduled to start peace
talks Thursday in Geneva.

   Many veterans applauded Vice President George
Bush's defense of his embattled running mate Monday and said the
controversy over Sen. Dan Quayle's military record was political
mudslinging.
   But several others, who fought in the Vietnam War while Quayle
served in the Indiana National Guard, said they felt he had
intentionally dodged combat duty and shirked his obligation to his
country.
   ``I don't like this mudslinging. ... I don't think he would have
turned his back on the good old U.S.A.,'' said Otto Lunacek, a
veteran from Batavia, Ill., who fought in the Korean War.
   But Fredy Champagne, a veteran from Garberville, Calif., who
fought in Vietnam in 1965-66, saw it differently.
   ``I don't believe the man's qualified to serve our country if
he's shirked his military duty,'' Champagne said, noting one way to
avoid the draft at that time was by getting into the National Guard.
   ``I don't think he represents the Vietnam-era generation in any
stretch of the imagination,'' he said. ``I don't think he can be
counted on in a time of crisis.''
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, met the controvery
head-on Monday during an appearance at the 89th annual national
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, delivering an
impassioned defense of the Indiana senator's record.
   ``Dan Quayle served in the National Guard, signing up in a unit
that had vacancies at the time and now he is under shrill, partisan
attack,'' Bush told about 4,500 veterans attending the convention's
opening session.
   ``He served honorably. True, he didn't go to Vietnam, but his
unit wasn't sent.
   ``But there's another truth: He did not go to Canada, he did not
burn his draft card, and he damn sure didn't burn the American
flag. I'm proud to have him at my side,'' Bush said as the crowd
cheered and gave him a standing ovation.
   A smaller crowd of about 2,500 cheered and whistled Quayle when
he made a hastily arranged appearance in which acknowledged his
debt to the older generation that served in World War II and other
conflicts.
   Many veterans leaving the auditorium at the McCormick Place
convention center said they were impressed by Bush's remarks.
   ``I think in a way (Quayle's military service) is kind of blown
out of proportion,'' said Billy Stansberry of Joplin, Mo., who
served in Vietnam in 1967-68. ``If the man's qualified, that's all
that matters to me.''
   ``I would say they're trying to give (Quayle) the shaft,'' added
Oakey Smith, a veteran from Stroudsburg, Pa., who was in the Army
during World War II, serving from 1942-45 in Burma, China and
India. ``Like Bush said, he was in the National Guard and his unit
never went overseas.
   ``You can't blame him for that. I would say it's a lot of to-do
about nothing. It's just politics _ you know, cut the other guy's
throat if you can,'' Smith said.
   Louis Green, a Chicago veteran who also served in the Pacific
during World War II, said he believes Quayle probably enlisted in
the National Guard to avoid being sent to Vietnam and possibly into
combat.
   But he said: ``It doesn't bother me that much. ... It is a hell
of a lot better than going to Canada and not joining anything.''
   About 600,000 of the VFW's 2.1 million members are Vietnam
veterans, organizers say.
   But an official of the Washington, D.C.-based National Vietnam
Veterans Coalition said Monday the VFW had not addressed many of
the concerns of veterans from that conflict.
   Jerry Kiley said coalition members were upset that Bush had
chosen to defend Quayle's record at the VFW convention.
   ``We believe Bush and his people are sandbagging on the Quayle
issue,'' said Kiley, vice president of the Vietnam veterans' group,
in a telephone interview from New York.
   ``The issue is how he got in (to the Guard). By doing that,
Quayle bumped somebody off that list, and it's likely the person he
bumped went to Vietnam.
   ``But what makes this worse is here's a hawk, a man clamoring to
send our boys into battle but who did not have the courage of his
own convictions to go himself,'' said Kiley of Garnerville, N.Y.

   This U.S. territory's
congressional delegate is resigning after he admitted conspiring to
defraud the government of more than $130,000, the governor said
Monday.
   Gov. A.P. Lutali said he had accepted Delegate Fofo I.F. Sunia's
resignation, which takes effect Sept. 6.
   Sunia, a Democrat, pleaded guilty Aug. 3 in Washington to
charges of operating a payroll-padding scheme. He is scheduled to
be sentenced on Oct. 4.
   The U.S. attorney's office accused Sunia and his chief aide,
Matthew K. Iuli, of using money obtained from the scheme to
entertain constituents, pay election and campaign expenses and make
house and car loan payments.
   Sunia announced his resignation in a one-sentence letter to
Lutali that contained no explanation. The date he chose, however,
is one day before the House Ethics Committee is scheduled to
consider action against him.
   Lutali said a special election to fill Sunia's seat would be too
costly, and instead the winner of the November election will take
office immediately instead of in January.

<HEAD>CBS Poll: Voters Question Quayle, but GOP is Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many voters harbor doubts about Sen. Dan Quayle
of Indiana as the GOP vice presidential nominee, although the
Republican ticket emerged from its national convention with a
narrow lead, a new poll has found.
   George Bush and Quayle led Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis
and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, by 46 percent to
40 percent in the CBS News poll of 1,221 registered voters across
the country.
   The survey, released Monday, was the first done entirely after
the Republican convention in New Orleans, which ended Thursday with
a well-received acceptance speech by Bush, and it found improvement
in ratings of his leadership and popularity.
   But half the respondents did not believe the 41-year-old Quayle
has the experience to be a good president, and 28 percent were
unsure. Thirty-nine percent wished Bush had chosen someone else.
   Quayle has faced questions about whether he used his wealthy
family's connections to get into the National Guard and avoid the
draft and combat in the Vietnam War. In the poll, 40 percent said
phone calls made to the Guard on his behalf represented ``an unfair
attempt'' to ease his admission; 40 percent said such calls were
acceptable and 20 percent were unsure.
   Among the seven in 10 who had heard of the issue, 48 percent
said they believed Quayle had joined the Guard to avoid the draft.
Just 29 percent thought that was not his main reason, and 22
percent said they didn't know.
   Also among those who had heard about it, just 50 percent
believed Quayle was telling the truth about the National Guard
issue, while 26 percent said he was not and 24 percent didn't know.
   Quayle also did not do well in comparison to Bentsen: Forty-one
percent said Bentsen would be a better vice president, to 28
percent for Quayle. The rest didn't know.
   Still, support was up for the Republican ticket as a whole.
Dukakis, enjoying his own convention bounce, had led by 17 points
in a CBS News-New York Times poll early this month.
   The 6-point spread in the new poll was just within its margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points. But other polls
have found Bush gaining, allowing the conclusion that the
Republicans lead slightly. In a Gallup poll this weekend, they led
by 9 percentage points, 51-42.
   Bush was expected to gain in popularity following the publicity
from his convention, just as Dukakis did after the Democratic
convention. Such bounces in the polls generally settle as the
campaign progresses.
   On Bush's personal ratings, 51 percent said they had faith in
his ability to deal wisely with an international crisis, while 37
percent said they would be uneasy. His rating on this question
earlier this month was the opposite.
   Bush was rated favorably by 39 percent and unfavorably by 25
percent in the new survey, much improved from his
favorable-unfavorable rating of 27-33 in the previous poll.
   Dukakis did worse on the confidence measure, with 53 percent
uneasy about him in a crisis, 29 percent confident. And his
favorable-unfavorable rating dropped from 38-19 before the GOP
convention to 32-25 after it.
   Efforts by Republicans at the convention to paint Dukakis as a
liberal had little effect: 34 percent saw him as a liberal,
compared with 35 percent in the earlier poll. But 34 percent said
Dukakis was more likely than Bush to raise taxes, up from 27
percent in early August.
   The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the latest auction, with rates on
three-month bills rising to the highest level since January while
six-month bills were unchanged.
   The Treasury Department sold $7 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.18 percent, up from 7.05
percent last week. Another $7 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.51 percent, the same as last week.
   The rates on three-month bills were the highest since they sold
for 7.23 percent on Jan. 13. The rate for the past two weeks on
six-month bills has been the highest since they averaged 7.52
percent on Aug. 5, 1985.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.42 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,816.50 and 7.92 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,620.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 8.27
percent last week, up from 8.17 percent the previous week.

   Twenty old wooden crates bought at
auction surprised their buyers with a treasure trove of casts,
drawings and other art apparently produced by California's
best-known turn-of-the-century artist.
   Jack and Linda Liberatis paid $100 for the crates at a sale at a
Bekins Van and Storage Co. in Belmont last spring.
   ``I thought they were tool boxes,'' said Jack Liberatis, a
commercial fisherman.
   Stashed inside and wrapped in old newspapers was an assortment
of art believed to be the work of Douglas Tilden, a deaf-mute
sculptor who the San Francisco Chronicle's architecture critic,
Allan Temko, has commended for producing ``San Francisco's greatest
single legacy of public art.''
   The crates contained scale models for giant statues,
larger-than-life plaster casts, busts of famous men, a life mask of
three noted California artists, drawings, diplomas and prizes from
expositions and old world fairs. There were 70 pieces in all.
   After some investigation, the Libertis concluded the materials
were found in Tilden's Berkeley studio the day he died in 1934.
They were packed up and put in storage by a relative who paid the
bills until 1987 or so. When the checks stopped, the storage
company had the right to sell the crates.
   ``If this is authenticated, it could be one of the greatest
finds in the history of California art,'' Temko said.
   Mildred Albronda, author of a book about Tilden, has inspected
the materials in the Liberatis' crates but said she is not sure of
their value. She noted they are ``mostly plaster ... And some are
not in pristine condition.''
   ``There is no question of its authenticity _ none at all,'' she
said Sunday.
   Oakland Museum's curator of sculpture, Harvey Jones, also
examined the work. He was out of town on Monday and couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Tilden, who studied in Paris, produced ``The Baseball Player''
sculpture which stands in Golden Gate Park in 1889.
   He specialized in monumental bronze sculptures. Three of his
public works _ the Mechanics Monument, the Admission Day Monument
and one of a heroic group commemorating the Spanish-American War _
highlight major intersections on San Francisco's Market Street.
   He planned a giant piece called ``The Bridge'' of a young man
and woman kneeling in an embrace across San Francisco Bay. The
monument was never cast in bronze, but the nine-foot plaster cast
for it was found in the crates by the Liberatis.
   ``I had produced masterpieces and enthroned San Francisco in the
art world,'' Tilden wrote. But in 1920 he gave up art and became a
machinist. ``California has forsaken art,'' he said.
   His style of art went out of style and by 1930 he was broke. The
electricity and water service was cut off to his studio and
neighbors reported he was starving. He died alone in his studio at
the age of 75.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle, preparing for his first solo
campaign trip, is getting coaching from former aides to President
Reagan who are experienced in presidential politics.
   The Republican vice presidential nominee had two senior staff
meetings Monday and spends today working on his stump campaign
speech as he prepares for a trip through the Midwest on Wednesday.
   Quayle flew back to the nation's capital Sunday, accompanied by
James A. Baker III, the campaign chairman and top strategist for
Republican presidential nominee George Bush, to meet with the new
campaign staff assembled for him by Bush aides.
   Stuart Spencer, a longtime Reagan adviser and member of the
president's ``kitchen cabinet,'' is chairing Quayle's campaign. His
deputy is Joseph Canzeri, known as an expert detail man during his
years in the Reagan White House. Quayle's press secretary, David
Prosperi, was Interior Secretary Donald Hodel's spokesman and also
worked at the Reagan White House.
   Vice President Bush and his aides have sought to play down
suggestions that Quayle's candidacy needed shoring up after a rocky
week dominated by the controversy over how Quayle, a pro-military
conservative on Capitol Hill, got into the National Guard in 1969
as his college draft deferment was about to end at the height of
the Vietnam War.
   But the staff that the Bush campaign has assembled to help
Quayle is a group with substantial experience in the White House
and presidential politics.
   Spencer, long a Reagan intimate, is a savvy strategist who has
been at Reagan's side in most of his political decisions.
   Canzeri served Nelson Rockefeller, titan of the Republican
Party's left wing, for nearly 20 years. A presidential assistant
and deputy to former Reagan aide Michael Deaver, Canzeri was known
as a Mr. Fixit in the White House for his quick humor and ability
to get things done.
   Canzeri resigned in 1982 under a cloud after accepting mortgages
at favorable interest rates from friends and double-billing the
White House and the Republican National Committee for ``$700 and
change'' for two dinners he gave while out of the country preparing
for presidential trips. The Justice Department later concluded that
Canzeri did not violate federal law.
   Prosperi was a junior Reagan aide in 1980 and later a deputy
White House press secretary before going to work for Hodel.
   Also on the staff is James Cicconi, a Washington lawyer and
former aide to Baker, who resigned as treasury secretary to chair
Bush's presidential campaign.

   Two giant pandas on loan from the People's
Republic of China are proving to be porkers.
   Since the Toledo Zoo exhibit opened more than three months ago,
Le Le has gained 15 pounds and Nan Nan has put on 10.
   The weight gain is not unusual, zoo officials say, especially
considering the pandas sleep 14 to 16 hours a day and when they are
awake feast on a diet of bamboo, a seven-grain ``panda bread'' and
apples.
   But there's no plan to put the portly pandas on a diet. The 5
percent weight gain of the pair still keeps them within normal
range for panda weight, said Bruce Clark, the zoo's senior mammal
keeper.
   Sunday was to have been the last day of the 100-day exhibit, but
zoo officials plan to continue the exhibition into next month in
hopes the Chinese will approve a request to display the animals for
100 more days. The zoo is awaiting a reply to its request.

   The 62-year-old Biltmore Hotel has
survived hurricanes, the Great Depression and financial problems.
But officials are now asking: Can it weather college freshman?
   About 160 University of Miami students left without dormitory
rooms have checked into the restored luxury hotel near the main
campus, courtesy of the school.
   Throughout the weekend, students lugged stereos, laundry baskets
and milk crates filled with albums and tapes through the ornate
lobby and past the gargoyles lining the staircases.
   The students will remain in the average $135-a-night rooms _
while paying the regular $1,290-per-semester board costs _ until
additional campus housing becomes available next month or in
October, university officials say.
   Meanwhile, students will be shuttled to classes by a free van
and return with full use of all hotel facilities, including an
Olympic-sized swimming pool, 10 tennis courts, an 18-hole golf
course, and daily maid service.
   Although cooking is not allowed in the rooms, the hotel will
offer pizzas for a reduced price of $4.95.

   A penny saved may be a penny earned, but
in Burlington County, penny parking meters are just plain popular.
   Nostalgia buffs are keeping county officials busy with inquiries
about the 160 antiquated meters that will be sold next month.
   ``Everybody who calls wants one,''said Deputy Township Manager
John Schoenberg. ``It's incredible.''
   Customers will be limited to two meters the first week. After
that, meters will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis,
Schoenberg said.
   ``We expect them to go fast,'' he said. ``People are eating them
up.''
   Officials decided to replace the meters, which have lined the
streets of this southwestern New Jersey town since the 1950s,
because they had difficulty finding replacement parts.
   For a penny, you could park for 12 minutes. An hour went for a
nickel and two hours for a dime. The new meters will be installed

<HEAD>Former Commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center Dead At 56</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maj. Gen. Lewis Apsey Mologne, who was twice
awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership as
commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, has died of cancer.
He was 56.
   Mologne, an army physician who in 1983 became commander of
Walter Reed, the military's central hospital in Washington, retired
from the military Aug. 1 and died Monday.
   He took over at a time when Walter Reed and the military medical
establishment had been plagued by revelations about incompetent
physicians, inaccuracies in drug testing, the theft of drugs and
unpaid bills. Three commanders had left within five years.
   Mologne was credited with restoring morale as he instituted new
procurement systems, streamlined paperwork, worked with city police
on the drug theft problem and reorganized the military's urinalysis
laboratory at Fort Meade in Maryland.
   Born in Mount Pleasant, Pa., Mologne was graduated from the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., and was commissioned in the
Army Corps of Engineers. He also was graduated from the Airborne
School at Fort Benning, Ga.
   He was a company commander in Korea before resigning from the
Army to attend medical school at the University of Pittsburgh. He
was commissioned in the Army Medical Corps after graduation and
later worked as a surgeon, administrator and medical professor.
   Mologne's posts included chief surgeon and deputy commander at
Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Colorado and head of the Army
Medical Command in South Korea. He was chief of medical corps
affairs and professional services director in the U.S. Surgeon
General's office from 1982 until he became commander at Walter Reed.

   Despite the cease-fire in the Persian
Gulf war, the main Iranian opposition group says it has not
abandoned its bloody campaign to topple Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's Islamic government.
   ``Under no circumstances will we halt our struggle against his
government,'' said Ali-Reza Jaferzadeh, spokesman for the
Iraq-based National Liberation Army of Iran. ``We will fight until
its downfall.''
   But the cease-fire that began Saturday will test the ability of
the rebels, led by Massoud Rajavi, to maintain a challenge to the
fundamentalist Islamic government in Tehran that began with
hit-and-run guerrilla raids and escalated to full-scale military
offensives.
   Yet even as Tehran appears to be taking the National Liberation
Army more seriously than it has for years, the rebels admit the
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire poses problems for continuing their
private war against the Islamic republic.
   Iraq is unlikely to allow the rebels, composed mainly of
fighters from the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, to
continue launching attacks across the border into Iran and risk
being blamed for violating the truce.
   Iranian and Iraqi negotiators are expected to seek assurances
that both sides will curb opposition groups from operating from
their territory. The negotiators are scheduled to meet in Geneva
Thursday to discuss a formal peace agreement to end the 8-year-old
war.
   Jafarzadeh, interviewed by telephone at rebel headquarters in
Baghdad, conceded the cease-fire will halt their attacks into Iran.
But he said the rebels will ``find alternatives to continue the
struggle'' against Khomeini.
   Asked what these were, he said, without elaboration: ``We have
suitable tactics to implement our strategy. We believe we can cope
with this new situation.
   ``We've always called for peace. Peace operates to our benefit
because it will hasten the downfall of Khomeini's government.''
   The rebels argue that the Tehran government, after recent
military setbacks and the unexpected unconditional acceptance last
month of the U.N. cease-fire resolution, is the most vulnerable it
has been since the 1979 revolution.
   Last month, the rebels launched the most ambitious attack in
their 18-month-old campaign, capturing the towns of Karand and
Eslamabad 65 miles inside Iran.
   President Ali Khamenei condemned the rebels as: ``A group of
hypocrites, two-faced and evil people, may appear in the country
supported by foreign propaganda ... to try to break our national
pride ... and make trouble.''
   Tehran claimed its forces killed 4,800 rebels in a three-day
battle and drove them back across the border.
   The rebel group said it lost 1,000 fighters but claimed to have
killed or wounded 40,000 of Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards.
   It is not possible to verify either side's claim. But diplomats
in Tehran and Baghdad are skeptical of the rebel claims and there
have even been suggestions Baghdad deliberately allowed the group
to be mauled to rid itself of what could become an embarrassment in
any peace deal.
   Iran's official media, monitored in Nicosia, has reported scores
of Mujahedeen prisoners and collaborators in western Iran have been
executed since late July.
   The rebels claim the Iranians have executed thousands of
captured fighters and political prisoners to stifle resistance.
   The Financial Times of London reported from Tehran last week
that scores of prisoners have been executed in detention centers in
the capital and buried in mass graves.
   The rebels believe, nevertheless, that their position will be
strengthened as many Iranians question why their government
accepted a cease-fire with Iraq now than a year ago, when Iran held
the military advantage.
   Diplomats in Tehran told The Associated Press there does not
appear to be any imminent internal threat to Khomeini's government.
   One reason, they said, was that many Iranians who may have been
sympathetic to the rebels were appalled by Rajavi's alliance with
Iraq.
   The Mujahedeen were allies of Khomeini against Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi during the revolution. But the fundamentalists turned
on the Mujahedeen, and other leftist factions, in a purge in which
thousands were killed or imprisoned.

<HEAD>`Papa' Peppard Says He Has Things In Common With Hemingway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They've been unlucky in love and had their
problems with booze, but George Peppard and Ernest Hemingway found
each other, and now Peppard is bringing Hemingway back home.
   The 59-year-old actor, known as Hannibal Smith of television's
``The A-Team,'' has brought his one-man play ``Papa: The Legendary
Lives of Ernest Hemingway,'' to Chicago's Royal George Theater, 10
miles from Hemingway's suburban Oak Park birthplace.
   The play is set in Cuba and depicts a day in the life of
Hemingway when he was 58, three years before his 1961 suicide.
   The play, produced by Peppard's Lime Tree Productions, ends its
run here Aug. 28 before heading to San Francisco, and then possibly
Broadway.
   ``Papa,'' written by John De Groot, struck Peppard when he first
read it, the actor said in a recent interview.
   ``Something like this happens once in a career, something this
good, this literate,'' the actor said.
   Reviews have been mixed. But Peppard said people who knew
Hemingway, author of ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' and ``The Old Man
and the Sea,'' have told him his portrayal brings Hemingway to life.
   Hemingway was married four times, drank too much, and played out
dangerous and exciting real-life roles _ an ambulance driver in
World War I, a big-game hunter, a deep-sea fisherman.
   Peppard also has married four times and has had his own problems
with the bottle, though he said he has been off alcohol nearly a
decade.
   ``It makes a big difference (in the character portrayal) that I
drank too much for 25 years,'' he said.
   He noted that many of his mother's siblings died young, and his
own father died when he was 22.
   ``Death has always been a presence in my life,'' he said.
   ``Both Hemingway and I have been exposed to the vicissitudes of
fame, so those things lent some real kinds of perceptions into a
character that is very complex.''
   The demise of ``The A-Team'' two years ago came six months'
after Peppard's separation from his fourth wife, Alexis Adams.
   ``Personally, emotionally, there wasn't anything that I wanted
to do or anywhere that I wanted to go,'' Peppard recalled.
   But the television show gave him the money to do Hemingway, and
now he has found satisfaction.
   ``I spent a lot of years doing a lot of (things) that I didn't
enjoy,'' he said. ``Now I'm doing something that I feel has great
quality and is extremely entertaining. I can stand a few years of
this.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists have described the
largest protest against the 1968 Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in
nearly two decades as ``an important political moment'' evidencing
a new attitude in Czechoslovakia.
   Thousands of people marched through the capital Sunday night in
the biggest protest since 1969 against the Aug. 20-21, 1968
invasion that crushed the experiment in democracy known as the
``Prague Spring.''
   The official news agency CTK said 28 people were still in
detention Monday after police arrested 77 people in Prague in what
it termed ``disturbing actions'' that ``grew into hooliganism.''
   Six of the seven unidentified foreigners detained were expelled,
CTK said without further details.
   Baton-wielding police with dogs on leashes charged a crowd of
about 1,000 demonstrators Sunday after the protest had dwindled
from an estimated 10,000 people, who marched through central Prague
chanting ``Long Live Freedom,'' ``Russians Go Home'' and ``Dubcek,
Dubcek, Dubcek.''
   Alexander Dubcek pioneered the ``Prague Spring'' reforms and was
ousted as Communist Party leader in 1969 and expelled from the
party the next year.
   Activists with the Charter 77 human rights group and the
independent cultural association Jazz Section noted the youth of
the demonstrators _ between ages 18 and 35 _ and said chanting
Dubcek's name appeared to be more a symbol than sympathy for his
person.
   ``He's a symbol of a time, of an atmosphere,'' said Vaclav Maly,
a Charter 77 signatory and Roman Catholic priest who authorities
have barred from preaching.
   ``It is important for people that they see we demonstrated, and
practically nothing happened,'' Maly said. ``It is an important
political moment.''
   ``Fantastic that 90 percent of it was young people who grew up
in this system,'' Jazz Section leader Karel Srp commented. ``It is
the first small flower that will grow up.''
   Charter 77 activist Zdenek Urbanek said he felt ``the same good
experience as in '68, when suddenly I saw young people who didn't
know anything about democracy, freedom and free elections ... speak
openly about what is needed for the country.''
   Activists interviewed Monday stressed that the protest developed
spontaneously and involved ordinary people rather than known
dissidents.
   Residents of Prague and frequent visitors have noticed an
increasing interest in politics and a trend toward popular activism
that departs marketly from the cynicism and fear prevalent since
the 1968 invasion.
   A Roman Catholic petition to Communist authorities demanding
more religious freedom was signed by half a million believers
earlier this year, and in March some 2,000 people demonstrated in
Bratislava to air similar demands.
   That was the last sizeable street protest in Czechoslovakia and
police dispersed the crowd using water cannon, trucks and vans. The
harsh police tactics, not unusual for Czechoslovakia, drew strong
criticism from the West.
   Activists speculated that concern for Czechoslovakia's image in
the West and possible influence from Moscow played a part in the
initial decision not to break up Sunday's protest at the start.
   Maly and Urbanek said they detected a ``more clever'' approach
on the part of authorities.
   Srp, however, who followed the protest throughout, attributed
the lack of police action to initial confusion, saying, ``nobody
expected it and they had no direction.''
   Reform in the Soviet Union has had an effect both on
Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership and on its citizens, who
follow Soviet press and television and see that much freer
expression of opinion is allowed.
   Czechoslovakia's leaders see Mikhail S. Gorbachev adopting many
of the same reforms pioneered by leaders of the ``Prague Spring.''
   Most recently, Gorbachev has spoken of striving for ``Socialism
with a human face'' _ a slogan used in 1968 by Dubcek.
   Milos Jakes, who replaced party leader Gustav Husak last
December, has embraced cautious economic reform but has so far
skirted any far-reaching political or cultural change.
   However, there has been a slightly more relaxed approach to
independent groups and dissidents, marking an important shift over
the past two years.
   Maly and Srp cautioned strongly, however, against expecting any
rapid political change in Czechoslovakia, where authorities have
ensured that living standards remain far higher than in other East
bloc countries.
   ``I wouldn't exaggerate it,'' Maly said. ``It is a start. The
society starts to be more active.''
   ``Czechoslovakia is an unpredictable country,'' said Srp.
``Nobody knows what will happen here.''

   Two peasants wielding a home-made pistol and a
dagger killed two clerks in robbing a bank in south China, but one
was captured and the other blew himself up when surrounded by
soldiers, a newspaper reported today.
   The official People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) said the two robbers,
from the outskirts of the provincial capital of Kunming, held up
the Industrial and Commercial Bank in Wenshan county at noon on
Aug. 17.
   It said the two killed two clerks and made off with $9,000 but a
third clerk, injured in the attack, sounded an alarm.
   Seven soldiers and other citizens gave chase, and one of the
robbers set off an explosive and killed himself when cornered. The
other was captured.
   Wenshan is in a heavily militarized area near China's tense
border with Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   A coalition of three leftist
parties whose leaders are linked to the Marxist-led guerrilla
movement say they will participate in elections for the first time
since the civil war began in 1979.
   The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three left-of-center
parties, announced Monday that it will choose its candidates in the
coming weeks for the March presidential elections.
   The coalition includes the National Revolutionary Movement, the
Popular Social Christian Movement and the Social Democratic Party.
   In the past, the Christian Democratic government of President
Jose Napoleon Duarte invited leftist political leaders to
participate in elections, but asked the guerrillas to lay down
their arms.
   Leftist parties have boycotted previous elections, saying their
security could not be guaranteed and elections formed part of a
U.S.-directed counterinsurgency plan.
   Guillermo Ungo, leader of the National Revolutionary Movement,
and Ruben Zamora, chief of the Popular Social Christian Movement,
are the president and vice-president of the Democratic
Revolutionary Front.
   The front forms a civilian-military alliance with the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla army battling the
U.S.-backed government.
   An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
civil war.
   Leftist civilian politicians recently said guerrilla leaders
understand their decision to take part in the March elections.
   ``Our objective in the electoral process is the promotion of a
political and negotiated solution to the armed conflict as an
indispensable condition for fulfilling the Salvadoran people's most
pressing demands,'' a communique issued by the coalition said.
   ``We are convinced that our participation will bind and mobilize
people around the objectives of social justice, democracy, national
independence and peace,'' the statement said.
   The election likely will be a close contest between El
Salvador's two dominant parties, the incumbent Christian Democrats
and the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   The rightist alliance, known as Arena, gained control of the
legislature and two-thirds of the country's municipal governments
in elections held in March.
   Duarte, barred by the constitution from another term as
president , has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer.

   The dangers in returning Americans
to space flight are overshadowed by the rewards, says one of five
astronauts scheduled to fly on the first shuttle mission since the
Challenger disaster.
   ``There are certain things in life that the importance really
transcends any danger that's involved or risk that's involved,''
Marine Lt. Col. Dave Hilmers said Monday at the last news
conference he and fellow Discovery crew members will hold before
their flight.
   ``The sense of privilege that I have in being a part of this and
the purpose very much overshadows any fear that I have.''
   Discovery's launch, expected during late September, will mark
the nation's return to manned space flight. On Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing its crew of
seven.
   Navy Capt. Rick Hauck, who will command the veteran crew on
Discovery's four-day mission, said the flight is important to
establish confidence in the space program.
   Although safety is important, Hauck said he was concerned about
people who believe all risks should be avoided.
   If the United States becomes afraid to take any risks then ``we
need to find out who's going to lead the world and follow them,''
he said.
   The mission will be a test flight, Hauck said, noting that the
shuttle has undergone 210 modifications since the Challenger
tragedy. Although mechanical failures could occur, he doesn't
believe any will be life-threatening.
   ``We clearly could not afford to lose another vehicle, much less
another crew,'' Hauck said. ``I don't think the manned space flight
program could withstand another Challenger on STS-26 (his flight).
   ``That's high stakes, but I'm not concerned that that's going to
happen. In the last year and a half, I've seen how we've modified
that machine and how we've done business. So I feel very
comfortable with the flight.''
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
have been hesitant to set a date for the often postponed launch
because engineers still are grappling with two problems that
developed during a test firing of Discovery's engines on the launch
pad at Cape Canaveral on Aug. 10, Hauck said.
   But, he added, ``I'm not aware of anything that might get in the
way of a late September launch.''
   One problem a small leak of hydrogen gas detected in an area
where the orbiter is joined to the external fuel tank. The other is
the apparent sluggishness of three gaseous oxygen valves in the
fueling system.
   Although NASA officials have said they don't think either
problem is serious, they still wanted to test both systems. They
hope they can announce resolutions and a launch date this week.
   The astronauts' main goal will be to deploy a communications
satellite. They also will conduct 11 science and technology
experiments.
   The other crew members are Air Force Col. Richard Covey, the
pilot, and mission specialists George Nelson and Mike Lounge.
   In addition to the changes in the orbiter, there were 50
modifications to the shuttle booster rockets. The Challenger
disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of two solid-fuel
booster rockets.
   On Monday, a tentative, undisclosed settlement was reached in
Richmond, Va., in a lawsuit filed by Jane Smith, widow of
Challenger pilot Michael J. Smith, against Morton Thiokol Inc.,
manufacturer of the faulty booster rocket. The case was the last of
the Morton Thiokol lawsuits to be settled.
   Also Monday, Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said an analysis
indicates that safety features in the redesigned booster performed
as designed during a crucial test-firing last week despite
deliberately incorporated flaws. The test was the fifth and final
full-scale firing needed to qualify the solid-fuel booster for
flight.
   Detailed inspection and analysis of the tested rocket will
continue through the rest of the month, Raab said.
   As the engineers continued their study, crew members expressed
eagerness to return to space.
   ``It's been a long time, and I think at times each of us has
been a little impatient when things have gone slowly,'' said
Nelson, ``but at the same time we understand that we had to go at
that pace to do the thorough job that we've done in getting the
shuttle back ready to fly again. We are ready to fly; we would like
to fly yesterday.
   ``It's going to happen,'' said Hauck.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former lobbyist Paula Parkinson is back in the
limelight and in Playboy magazine, offering new details about a
1980 vacation when she briefly shared a cottage with Republican
vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle and two other congressmen.
   Jonathan Black, managing editor of Playboy, said Monday that
Parkinson's ``new comments'' about events at the Florida cottage
eight years ago would appear in text accompanying a ``Women of
Washington'' pictorial in the November issue of the magazine.
Parkinson will appear nude in the pictorial.
   Black said the article was originally written long before Quayle
was named as Vice President George Bush's running mate, but that
``new material'' from Parkinson was inserted last week.
   Black declined to answer further questions about the article or
its contents. The magazine is scheduled to be on the newsstands
Oct. 1.
   Parkinson first appeared nude in the magazine in 1980, several
months after being identified as the woman who shared a cottage
with Quayle and former Reps. Tom Railsback of Illinois and Thomas
B. Evans of Delaware.
   Quayle never was accused of intimacy with her, and a Justice
Department investigation of Parkinson's relationships with members
of Congress found no impropriety.

   Former President Gerald Ford says he would
have called on an influential friend to get his son into the
National Guard if confronted with a situation like that Republican
vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle faced in 1969.
   ``Any father who wouldn't, in my judgment, would be neglecting
his parental responsibility,'' Ford said at a press conference
Monday.
   Ford said some reporters have been ``bloodthirsty'' in
questioning the military record of Quayle since GOP presidential
nominee George Bush named the Indiana senator as his running mate.
   ``Well, I think I would have called a friend,'' Ford said.
   Quayle has said he sought service in the Guard so he could

<TEXT>
   Federal employees who counsel Vietnam War
veterans have been ordered not to give media interviews on
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's National Guard
service.
   One angry counselor called the order a violation of his right to
speak out. But the official who issued the directive in seven
western states said he was merely reinforcing a law that bars
government employees from getting involved in politics.
   The order was issued Friday by Farrell Udell, associate regional
manager for the western region of the Veterans Administration
readjustment counseling service.
   ``Because we're a government organization, we do not care to
comment on political issues,'' Udell said in a telephone interview
from his San Francisco office.
   David Culmer, a counselor in the agency's office in the Westwood
neighborhood of Los Angeles, said, ``I don't feel that federal
employees should be censored or muzzled or not allowed to speak
their opinion. I don't think it's appropriate.''
   Quayle, the Indiana senator tabbed by Vice President George Bush
as his running mate, has faced questions about whether he used his
family's influence to get into the National Guard in 1969 and so
avoid being drafted into combat in the Vietnam War.

   In the poll, commissioned by Jackson radio station WJNT and
conducted by Rick Knox and Associates of Jackson Aug. 19-20, 52
percent indicated they will vote for Bush while 36 percent said
they planned to vote for Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Another 9 percent were undecided and 3 percent favored other
candidates.
   Pollsters contacted 1,000 registered state voters statewide, 200
at random from each of the state's five congressional districts.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

   Uncle Sam will get about $100,000 of the
money left by a widow who wanted her estate used to reduce the
national debt, but the bequest is only enough to offset the
gargantuan debt for 21 seconds.
   The federal government and Kentucky recently reached an
agreement on the distribution of the money after a legal battle of
more than four years over whether the state was entitled to
inheritance taxes.
   Under the agreement, the state will get $30,000, and the U.S.
Bureau of Public Debt will get the $100,000 or so remaining after
bequests to relatives.
   Minnie Vogel, who had no children, died in May 1984 at age 85.
She left $35,000 of her $188,000 estate to seven nieces and nephews.
   ``All the rest ... I bequeath and devise to my beloved country,
the United States of America, to be used to reduce the national
debt,'' Ms. Vogel said in her will. ``The reason for this
distribution ... is because of the deep love I have for America and
I wish to show my appreciation and love in helping my country in
this small way.''
   The national debt is $2.5 trillion, and grows an estimated
$100,000 every 21 seconds.
   The agreement was recently approved by Jefferson Circuit Judge
Edmund P. Karem. The parties are awaiting final approval from
Jefferson District Probate Court, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Michael F. Spalding.
   Spalding said he is pleased the case seems about to be resolved
but is not sure why it took four years.
   In an effort to resolve the issue, the federal government agreed
to abide by Kentucky law and pay the inheritance tax. But Ms.
Vogel's lawyer sued, saying he did not think it was Ms. Vogel's
intent that part of her money should go to the state.
   ``We felt her intent was to give it all to the federal
government,'' said Sheldon Isaacs, the lawyer who prepared the will
and is administering the estate.
   All parties acknowledged they lacked a clear precedent.
   David Liebschutz, a spokesman for the Bureau of Public Debt,
said he could recall just one donation of similar size: the
$100,000 given annually by a retired Ohio industrialist who also
sends the bureau his monthly Social Security checks.
   Liebschutz said few people will their money to the government.
   The fund to reduce the public debt receives about $500,000 a
year in donations, he said. Most contributions from individuals
come as checks for $10 or $20.

<TEXT>
   Mariel Hemingway, who nine years ago played
Woody Allen's teen-age lover in the movie ``Manhattan,'' says she
still gets nervous playing sex scenes even though she's married and
a mother.
   The actress said in this week's TV Guide she hopes her lead part
in the forthcoming HBO movie ``Steal the Sky'' will help her land
more mature roles.
   ``I'm 26. I'm not a little girl anymore,'' she said.
   Still, she is shy about nudity and love scenes.
   ``I'm sure you can trace it all back to `Manhattan,''' said
Hemingway, who married businessman Stephen Crisman nearly four
years ago and has an 8-month old daughter, Dree Louise. ``I got
embarrassed. I'd never even had a boyfriend before, and now I was
Miss Sex. I'd be barelegged with Woody in bed, in my panties and a
T-shirt, or kissing him in Central Park.''
   At age 17, Hemingway saw herself as a gawky tomboy and admitted
that she had ``some real self-esteem problems.''
   She said she believes everyone thought she was ``girlish and
athletic but not sexy'' despite ``people like Woody talking about
my body the way they did.''

<HEAD>Stress Blamed On Rare Bird's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stress is believed to have killed a zoo-hatched
Andean condor that was on its way to freedom in an experiment to
see how its endangered North American cousin will adapt to the wild.
   Three other transplanted Andean condors in the program were
doing well Monday, officials said.
   The Andean birds were chosen for the experiment because it is
the closest living relative to the California condor. Though the
Andean species is also endangered, they number in the thousands.
Only 28 of its North American cousins exist and all in captivity.
   The Andean condors, which are also endangered, were transported
to Los Padres National Forest in airline-style animal shipping
crates and placed in secret holding pens Saturday.
   One died while being transported.
   Preliminary results of an autopsy show the death was
stress-related, although infection has not been ruled out, said Joe
Dowhan, condor recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Final test results are expected by Wednesday.
   He said it was premature to say how officials might have handled
the move differently or what changes might be implemented to
prevent other deaths.
   ``This is a learning process. Right now there are all kinds of
scenarios we could consider changing,'' he said.
   Scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds
hatched in captivity adapt to freedom, fending for themselves in a
region without native birds of their species to serve as examples.
   The first group of the 3- and 4-month-old birds are scheduled to
spend several weeks in mesh enclosures in the forest 75 miles
northeast of Los Angeles.
   Two came from the San Diego Wild Animal Park; one was from the
Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent, Md.; and the one that
died came from the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Scientists will prepare the birds for their first flights over
the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large
population of California condors.
   The condors are being exposed to other young condors for the
first time because they were raised singly, as in the wild, Dowhan
said.
   More Andean condors will be brought to the area in October.
   In December, when the birds should be able to fly, scientists
will fit them with radio monitors, release them, and follow their
progress.
   The Andean birds will remain in the wild until it's time to
release California condors, perhaps as early as 1992 if officials
have continued success in captive breeding programs at the Wild
Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo, Dowhan said.
   Blood tests on the first California condor conceived in
captivity determined the bird is a female, officials said Monday.
   The 4-month-old bird, named Molloko, also was determined to be
``in perfect health,'' said Tom Hanscom, spokesman at the Wild
Animal Park. The bird, which weighed in at 6} ounces when born
April 29, now weighs 16 pounds.
   Fourteen of the 27 other California condors are females. Park
officials say further tests will determine which of the birds are
related and how they will be separated for breeding.

<HEAD>Newspapers Ask Judge To Throw Out $700,000 Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for two newspapers have asked a judge
to throw out a $700,000 jury award to a public relations man who
sued the papers for breaking a promise not to print his name as the
source of a news story.
   The lawyers for the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and
Minneapolis-based Star Tribune argued Monday that Hennepin County
District Court Judge Franklin Knoll should have instructed the jury
to consider whether the First Amendment gives newspapers a right to
breach a contract.
   Knoll said he will issue a ruling later on the newspapers'
request that he reverse the jury verdict or grant a new trial.
   The jury decided that the newspapers engaged in
misrepresentation when reporters for both papers promised Dan Cohen
that they would not identify him as a source. Editors later
overruled the reporters and published Cohen's name.
   The jury last month found misrepresentation and awarded Cohen
$500,000 in punitive damages and $200,000 in compensatory damages.
   Star Tribune lawyer James Fitzmaurice argued Monday that the
jury had no grounds for its ruling. He said Cohen should have been
required to show the newspapers acted with ``malice'' in breaking
their oral agreements, a standard used in libel cases.
   But the judge questioned whether the First Amendment allows
newspapers to break contracts.
   ``Then I guess the point is that no one should make a contract
with you because they can't be assured your client won't break
it,'' the judge told Fitzmaurice.
   Cohen leaked court documents to reporters during the 1982
gubernatorial campaign that revealed that Marlene Johnson, who was
the successful candidate for lieutenant governor, had a shoplifting
record.
   Cohen, who worked for rival candidate Wheelock Whitney, provided
the information on the condition that he not be identified. Editors
at the newspapers testified that they broke the promise because the
public had a right to know the information came from the Whitney
campaign.

<HEAD>Japan Vows To Continue Defense Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has not stopped its military
buildup in the Far East and the U.S. economy is in comparative
decline, so Japan will continue its five-year defense expansion
program, the Defense Agency said today.
   The decision is likely to keep Japan's military spending above 1
percent of its gross national product, a self-imposed ceiling
abandoned last year by the government that had been observed since
1976.
   The budget for defense-related expenses for the current fiscal
year is $28 billion, an estimated 1.013 percent of Japan's GNP.
   In its annual report on defense, the government said ``the
Soviet Union has adopted a military buildup as one of its top
priorities and as a result has increased its strength enough to
confront the U.S. in the spheres of both nuclear and conventional
warfare.''
   The report said that although the United States continues to
play a major role in international politics, ``no one can deny that
its position has recently been declining comparatively in the
economic field.
   ``Under these circumstances, Japan will be increasingly expected
to play a role commensurate with its position as the second-largest
economic power among free world nations next to the United
States,'' it said.
   The report said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
emphasized peaceful intentions, but ``there is no change in the
trend of continuous military buildup of the Soviet Union as seen in
the realities of deployment of SS-24 ICBM (intercontinental
ballistic missiles), commissioning of a fourth Kiev-class aircraft
carrier and deployment of a fourth generation of fighter aircraft.''
   It said that in the Far East, the Soviet Union has begun to
build up its forces rapidly, deploying ``enormous forces'' along
the Soviet-China border.
   Japan has already begun development of a surface-to-ship missile
which will be used by its Ground Self-Defense Forces beginning this
year. It also is developing a new anti-submarine deck helicopter to
engage in anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare.
   Japan has about 180,000 authorized defense personnel. The
figures are not broken down by services.
   According to the report, the United States had 50,400 men
stationed in Japan as of Dec. 31, 1987, of whom about 2,100 were in
the Army, 7,400 in the Navy, 23,600 in the Marine Corps and 17,300
in the Air Force.
   The report said Japan should steadily improve its defense
capabilities as planned in the National Defense Program Outline, a
five-year program to beef up Japan's defenses.
   The Japanese government passed the controversial five-year
defense buildup plan in September 1985 to meet U.S. requests that
Japan shoulder more of the burden for its own defense.
   The plan calls for an annual increase of 7.9 percent in defense
spending, compared to about 6 percent in previous years.
   Defense spending is a sensitive issue in Japan, where
anti-military sentiment has been strong since the militarism of
World War II. The constitution renounces war as a sovereign right.

<TEXT>
   A young convict tried a first-class
getaway, fleeing a work detail in chauffeured limousine before
being recaptured at a luxury hotel 60 miles away, authorities said.
   Derrick Stillwell, 21, was arrested Monday at the AMFAC Hotel
near Albuquerque International Airport a few hours after he walked
away from the work detail in Santa Fe and into the Cadillac limo,
officials said.
   Authorities arrested three other people found hiding behind
curtains on the balcony outside the seventh-floor room where
Stillwell was found, police said. Stillwell was traced through a
tip to Crime Stoppers, which pays rewards for tips on crimes, said
police Sgt. Ray Sandoval.
   Stillwell was back at the prison today. The minimum-security
inmate is serving an 18-month sentence for fraud at the
Pentitentiary of New Mexico near Santa Fe, said state Department of
Corrections spokesman Kevin Jackson.
   The three others were identified as Lillie Garcia, 18; Carl
Duckworth Jones, 24, and a 17-year-old girl, authorities said.
   Ms. Garcia and Jones were booked for investigation of harboring
a fugitive, according to jail records. Information on the juvenile
was not immediately available.
   Stillwell was one of seven prisoners assigned to a work detail
at the district headquarters of the state Highway and
Transportation Department next to state police headquarters in
Santa Fe, said Jackson. One guard was assigned to the crew when the
escape occurred.
   ``A dark blue limousine pulled up and the inmate expeditiously
leaped into the vehicle and was driven away,'' Jackson said.
   The guard alerted corrections officials and roadblocks went up.
   Stillwell's chauffeur ``had no inkling he was an inmate,''
Jackson said. ``I believe the driver thought it was a
business-as-usual pickup.''
   The driver, Phillip L. Pacheco, told officials his passenger
said he planned to catch a flight to Los Angeles, then Seattle, the
spokesman said.
   ``We believe there might have been tickets left at the
airport,'' he said.
   Pacheco also said his passenger asked him to stop briefly at a
home in Albuquerque before going to the airport, Jackson said. The
driver said Stillwell talked to a person there briefly, then got
back into the car and yelled out as he was leaving ``not to worry,
he would write.''
   Stillwell, a native of New York City, had earned time off for
good behavior and had been scheduled for release in December,
Jackson said.

<TEXT>
   Sudan decreed new regulations to crack down
on black market dealers who have inflated prices after the worst
floods in the country's history, the official Sudanese radio
reported.
   Omdurman radio quoted Maj. Gen. Mohammed el-Fateh Abdoun, mayor
of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, as saying Monday night that
food wholesalers and retailers were required to report the extent
of their stock to authorities within 48 hours.
   He said merchants dealing in cement, wood, zinc and iron should
provide a similar inventory within a week. He said offenders would
be tried.
   ``Worse than the natural disasters are the moral disasters which
have prompted some citizens to exploit the bad situation as a means
for unlawful riches,'' Abdoun was quoted as saying. The radio
broadcast was monitored in London.
   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 caused floods that left 91 people dead
and 1.5 million Sudanese homeless. Damage has been estimated at
$200 million.
   Sudan also faces the annual flood of the Nile River. The river
already has started overflowing in central Sudan and areas south of
Khartoum.
   ``All of a sudden, some essential commodities have disappeared
from the markets despite the fact that available data indicate
their abundance,'' Abdoun was quoted as saying.
   ``Therefore, we have decided to reinforce the law until we
restore to the state its respect and deter those who tamper with
essential food,'' he said.
   Abdoun noted that the absence of supervision and the
disintegration of local authority after the floods had contributed
to the situation.
   He urged Sudanese citizens to report on merchants who hoard
supplies, saying that informers will be awarded 10 percent of the
quantity of the goods reported.

   Stock prices fell for the second day in a row on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday, while the dollar held its ground
against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 130.24-point
loser the previous day, lost another 159.23 points, or 0.57
percent, to finish at 27,919.95 points. The main barometer in Tokyo
trading closed below the 28,000-point level for the first time
since Aug. 16.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 133.93 yen,
up only 0.05 yen from Monday's closing, after moving in a narrow
range of 133.75-134.00 yen.
   ``The decline in New York overnight led lower share prices and
thin trading here today (Tuesday). In addition, investors are
afraid of the higher interest rates worldwide and are buying
less,'' a stock analyst with a major securities firm in Tokyo said.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar opened trading at 133.75 yen,
down from Monday's close of 133.80 yen, and traded mainly between
133.75 and 133.93 yen throughout the morning. The dollar was
changing hands at 133.89 yen at midmorning.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar-yen rate was expected
to remain steady, with investors seen as selling the U.S. currency
when it reaches the 134-yen level.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wing flaps malfunctioned on a chartered jet
carrying reporters covering Republican presidential nominee George
Bush, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing, officials
said.
   Monday's incident was the second malfunction involving the plane
in three days, the charter company said.
   None of the 80 reporters on the plane was injured as the Boeing
727 landed at O'Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon
after dumping fuel over Lake Michigan, according to a supervisor at
the O'Hare tower who declined to be identified.
   The reporters had covered the vice president's campaign stop in
Chicago and were following Bush to his next stop in Spokane, Wash.
   The plane, chartered from Key Air of Rosslyn, Va., was grounded
Monday night and the reporters took another flight to Spokane, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   He said dumping the fuel in the lake while the plane approached
O'Hare was not unusual under the circumstances.
   ``It's a precaution. When you make an emergency landing you
don't want to come in loaded, heavy with fuel,'' Edelstein said.
   Key Air Vice President Scott Andrews said the flaps on the
plane's wings failed to go back to their normal position after
takeoff.
   Andrews said the plane could have flown to Spokane had the
captain chosen to do so, though at a much lower altitude and slower
speed.
   During Bush's trip to Ohio last weekend, smoke entered the jet's
cabin as the aircraft landed at Port Columbus International Airport.
   In that incident, airport officials said a hose came loose and
allowed a small amount of smoke to leak. The problem was described
as minor.

   A 71-year-old retired American teacher set
off from Shakespeare Beach in Dover today in his attempt to become
the oldest person to swim the English Channel.
   Ashby Harper, 71, of Albuquerque, N.M., will be attempting to
recapture his record from Australian Clifford Batt, who swam the
channel last year at the age of 68, breaking the record set by
Harper in 1982.
   Harper swam ashore from his hired pilot boat, the Hermus, to
stand on the beach in order to start. He told a small group of
people on the beach he was looking forward to the 21-mile crossing.
   Harper plunged into the calm sea just before 6 a.m., swimming
off under overcast skies.
   The swimmer postponed an attempt at crossing the channel Monday
because of rough seas.

   Amnesty International said today it has new
evidence of political prisoners in Singapore being tortured during
interrogations by officials of the Internal Security Department.
   A 15-page report from the international human rights
organization says some of the seven prisoners _ three women and
four men _ have been subjected to round-the-clock questioning in
cold rooms, doused with cold water and repeatedly slapped in the
face if they were uncooperative in making self-incriminating
``confessions.''
   Relatives who saw the prisoners said most of them ``looked
extremely tired and haggard, with dark rings under their eyes, sore
lips, coughs, and most appeared thinner,'' the report said.
   In Singapore, officials declined comment on the report. Local
newspapers did not publish stories on the report.
   The Amnesty report says relatives fear the prisoners might have
been drugged or otherwise ill-treated because most had unnaturally
darker and patchy skin complexions.
   The London-based human rights group said it was asking the
Singapore government for an independent inquiry to investigate the
allegations. It called for the prosecution of any offending
officers and for the prisoners' release.
   The seven were among a group arrested in mid-1987, accused of a
``Marxist conspiracy'' to overthrow the state, but later set free.
Amnesty said the seven were again arrested in April after denying
the allegations and claiming they were ill-treated in detention.
   After sending a mission to Singapore in June 1987, Amnesty
published a report in October charging that the 22 people
originally detained underwent ``severely cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment'' during interrogation.
   All 22 were adopted as ``prisoners of conscience,'' the Amnesty
term for detainees arrested for holding non-violent beliefs.
   ``We are concerned about the continued detention of these seven
persons and we received via relatives and lawyers information from
the detainees themselves for this new report,'' said Amnesty
spokeswoman Carline Windall.
   The women were identified as Teo Soh Lung, 39, lawyer; Chng Suan
Tze, 39, lecturer in English, and Wong Souk Yee, 30, market
research executive. The men are Vincent Cheng Kim Chuan, 41,
theologian; Kenneth Tsang Chi Seng, 35, media analyst; Kevin
Desmond De Souza, 27, student organizer, and Chew Kheng Chuan, 30,
businessman.
   Amnesty said it sent to Singapore authorities the names of
officers who it had been told ill-treated detainees.

   The poll of 1,000 women ages 18 to 44 found that the most
essential element to career success is confidence, followed by a
supportive husband or partner.
   Among other findings:
   _Satisfaction is closely tied to personal and familial aspects
of women's lives.
   _Women with children consider birth control and child care as
very important elements in career success.
   _Most women believe the ideal age to start a family is in her
early twenties.
   _Though most women believe it is very important to plan the
timing of her first child, half the mothers interviewed said their
first was unplanned.
   The poll, commissioned by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., which
makes birth-control products, found that 88 percent were either
mostly or very satisifed with their lives.
   Fifty-three percent of married women reported being very
satisfied, compared with 28 percent of unmarried women.
   Thirty-nine percent of married women and 53 percent of unmarried
women said they were mostly satisfied. The poll surveyed 673
married and 327 unmarried women.
   Women with children were more likely to say they are very
satisfied with their lives (46 percent to 39 percent). And 52
percent of those working part time said they were very satisfied,
compared with 41 percent of those working full time and 45 percent
who were not employed.
   Asked whether they had met most of their goals, 64 percent said
yes _ though the numbers were 75 percent for college graduates and
39 percent for those who didn't finish high school. Similarly, 82
percent of those whose household income was $35,000 to $49,999 said
they had met their goals, compared with 42 percent of those with
income under $15,000.
   Though the overall percentage of those who believed they'd
eventually meet their goals was 83 percent, the number was just 57
percent for those without a high school diploma.
   The poll found 75 percent believed it was essential to have
confidence to be successful at a job.
   Other elements considered important were a supportive husband or
partner (listed by 66 percent), affordable child care (64 percent),
effective birth control (58 percent), excellent health (51 percent)
and a college education (45 percent).
   Fifty-one percent said the ideal age for a woman to start a
family is from ages 21 to 25. Thirty percent said 26 to 30 is the
best age. Six percent said younger than 21 and 3 percent said older
than 30.
   Sixty-three percent said it is very important to plan when to
have the first child, though 48 percent said their first child was
unplanned and 51 percent said it was.
   The random poll was conducted by phone June 17-21 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Arson Ruled Out In Social Club Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll in a fire that gutted a basement
social club was revised downward from seven to six, and officials
said the blaze did not appear to be arson as was originally
suspected.
   ``We believe at this point that the fire was accidental, but
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be
interviewed by fire marshals,'' Fire Department spokesman John
Mulligan said Monday.
   Dozens of patrons who were injured in Sunday's fire at the Bronx
club known as The Hole remain hospitalized, many severely burned.
Eighteen firefighters also were hurt, none seriously.
   Arson was initially suspected because of the rapid spread of the
blaze at the club, which officials said operated illegally because
it served liquor without a license and didn't have enough exits to
comply with building codes.
   Many social clubs here operate like bottle clubs in other
states, where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from
the management.
   Fire and police officials were unable Monday to explain why
seven dead were counted Sunday instead of the correct six, said
police spokesman Peter O'Donnell.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Monday that he wanted the city to do
more to close illegal social clubs.
   ``What can we do to locate all of these illegal premises and
close them down?'' Koch said in a memo to the police commissioner,
fire commissioner and buildings commissioner.
   The Hole has been raided five times since March by the Police
Department, and there have been nine arrests, said Koch spokesman
Tom Kelly.
   The club did not have a liquor license, Kelly said.
   Koch described the club, a 50-by-75-foot T-shaped space, as a
``rabbit warren.''
   The steep, narrow staircase leading down to the club was ``no
better than a ladder,'' said Mulligan.

   Underground leaders of the 8-month-old
Palestinian uprising today urged more attacks on Israelis and
called on Arabs to set up independent institutions in the occupied
territories.
   The calls came in a leaflet that also designated today a day of
firebomb attacks to protest Israel's deportation of 33 Arabs since
the revolt against 21 years of Israeli occupation began in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The leaflet was distributed a day after Israeli troops shot and
wounded 17 Palestinians in bloody clashes throughout Gaza. Ninety
other Arabs were injured by beatings or overcome by tear gas,
Western relief officials said.
   ``There is no going back on the achievements realized on the
path to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on
our national soil ... The Zionists (will) be driven out of our land
so we may built on it our independent state with its capital in
Jerusalem,'' the four-page statement said.
   There is ``no sign of weariness on the part of the masses,'' the
leaflet added. ``We invite you to extend the struggle against the
occupation.''
   The leaflet, the 24th issued since the uprising began Dec. 8,
called for setting up underground classrooms, planting crops for
storage and boycotting Israeli farm products.
   It also called on Palestinians to stage four days of general
strikes over the next seven days in solidarity with deportees and
with five Palestinians killed in a fire in Tel Aviv and by Israeli
troops in a prison riot last week.
   Palestinians also were urged to defy Israel's ban on autonomous
grassroots committees, calling for ``redoubled efforts'' to build
more of them.
   It also applauded neighboring Jordan's severing earlier this
month of legal and adminstrative ties with the West Bank as ``one
of the main achievements of the uprising.''
   An army spokesman said, meanwhile, that soldiers maintained
curfews today on four refugee camps and neighborhoods where the
violence occurred in the Gaza Strip, confining about 118,000
Palestinians to their homes.
   The West Bank's largest city of Nablus and three neighboring
refugee camps, whose combined populations are about 140,000, also
were under curfew for a second straight day.
   The clashes followed a general strike, which was called to
protest the Israeli policy of confiscating propety of Arabs
refusing to pay taxes.
   The fighting became intense when the Israeli army imposed
curfews in the Jabaliya, Shati and Bureij refugee camps and parts
of Gaza City.
   Palestinians using loudspeakers at Moslem mosques called on
residents of the camps to defy the orders, and hundreds responded,
blocking roads, burning tires and stoning Israeli patrols.
   No deaths were reported in Monday's violence. At least 252 Arabs
and four Israelis have been killed in the clashes since the
uprising began in the lands Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   In another development, Michel Sabah, the first Arab to be
appointed Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, rejected an
invitation to meet Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin at the Parliament
in Jerusalem, a church official said Monday.
   He told The Associated Press the refusal was in line with the
church's policy not to meet with Israeli authorities in Jerusalem.
   The Vatican does not recognize Israeli control over Jerusalem,
which was given international status under a 1947 partition plan by
the United Nations. Israel captured the Arab section of Jerusalem
in the 1967 war and later declared all of the city as the Israeli
capital.

   A Taiwanese airline has applied for
government permission to begin the first direct passenger flights
between Taiwan and China, officials reported today.
   But Yuan Sung-hsi, a Communications Ministry spokesman, told
reporters the application would be denied because the Nationalists
on Taiwan are technically still at war with the Chinese Communists,
who won a civil war on the China mainland in 1949.
   The application from Formosa Airlines, a domestic carrier,
requested permission to fly between Taiwan and the Chinese cities
of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen and Fuzhou,
officials said.
   An airline official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the company planned to operate the service with a U.S. airline. He
declined to identify the U.S. company or provide additional details.
   The Nationalist government continues to claim it is China's
legitimate government and is opposed to any official contacts
between the rival governments. But it adopted a more lenient policy
toward China last year and Taiwanese now may visit the Chinese
mainland for reunions.
   Officials of the government's Entry and Exit Bureau say more
than 150,000 Taiwanese have already visited China via other
countries for the reunions.

<HEAD>Valerie Harper Denies She Tried to Control `Valerie' Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valerie Harper denied she tried to gain
control over the TV series ``Valerie'' before its producers fired
her for allegedly violating her contract, testifying, ``I wasn't
trying to be Genghis Khan.''
   ``I wanted to have participation, early knowledge of stories so
I would be in a partnership on the show,'' she testified Monday,
her 48th birthday.
   Ms. Harper, who was to continue testifying in Los Angeles County
Superior Court this afternoon, was called to the stand by Lorimar,
which is suing her for alleged breach of contract. She is
countersuing, contending that Lorimar wrongfully fired her a year
ago.
   Lorimar replaced Ms. Harper with Sandy Duncan and renamed the
NBC-TV show ``The Hogan Family.''
   Lorimar attorney Donald Engel on Monday sought to show that Ms.
Harper was aware of all aspects of her 1985 contract, and tried to
renegotiate it because she craved more money and total control over
``Valerie.''
   Ms. Harper denied this, saying she left business matters in the
hands of her husband, Tony Cacciotti, and left the contract to her
agent and lawyer, whose advice she later came to doubt.
   ``I'm not good with contracts,'' she said, holding the Lorimar
document. ``I read these and start to get cross-eyed.''
   Ms. Harper acknowledged that even before the pilot for
``Valerie,'' was sold, her relations with other members of the
production staff began to erode.
   The first problem, she said, arose when Cacciotti's name was
left off the credits for the pilot even though he was supervising
producer.
   ``I was disappointed and hurt,'' she said. ``It felt like a
betrayal.''
   As ``Valerie'' began production, Ms. Harper said, she came to
feel that her agent, Jim Berkus, was working more in the interest
of his firm, Leading Artists, than hers.
   ``I had my doubts about how well we were being represented,''
she said.
   ``Do you think Mr. Berkus did a good job in negotiating this
agreement?'' asked Engel.
   ``No,'' replied Ms. Harper.
   Engel then listed the financial terms of the contract, which
brought Ms. Harper $1.5 million for the first one-and-a-half
seasons and provided profit shares and escalating salaries for her
and her husband in subsequent years. In the sixth season, she would
have received $90,000 per episode.
   ``Didn't you realize that you had a very favorable deal?'' asked
Engel.
   ``I felt financially it was a start,'' Ms. Harper replied.
   Ms. Harper said she sought to renegotiate her contract later to
increase her salary and put in writing her participation in
creating story ideas for each episode.
   By then, she conceded, she felt she was losing the right to
influence story lines.
   ``The consultation I had enjoyed had eroded and the relationship
with (the producers) had started to turn,'' she said.
   ``What you thought you had was total control,'' said Engel.
   ``I would disagree,'' said Ms. Harper. ``I wanted participation,
not control. ... I wasn't trying to be Genghis Khan. I wanted
participation with people I loved and respected.''

<HEAD>Parents Of Victim Led Police To Suspect In 60 Rapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspect in dozens of attacks attributed
to the ``handcuff rapist'' was arrested after a victim's parents
lured him into a trap in an amateur stakeout lasting more than a
year, a newspaper reported today.
   The parents spent several nights a week searching for their
daughter's attacker despite police warnings they were putting their
lives in danger and probably wasting their time, The Columbus
Dispatch said in a copyright story.
   The father, armed with a gun, would wait in a car while his wife
acted as a decoy on the same corner where her daughter was raped in
June 1987, the newspaper said.
   Police announced Monday that Robert Biddings, 34, was arrested
Thursday and was being held in the Franklin County jail on one
count of rape and two counts of kidnapping in lieu of $750,000
bond. They said they would seek to have him charged with up to 60
rapes.
   Biddings is a suspect in a series of attacks dating back to 1984
that had been attributed to the ``handcuff rapist,'' so called
because he used handcuffs in early attacks, said police spokeswoman
Denise Pangborn.
   The Dispatch, quoting police reports, court records and
unidentified sources, said the rape victim's parents decided to
track down their 23-year-old daughter's attacker themselves and
find the evidence needed to break the case.
   The father said he knew police were understaffed and could not
spend as much time on the case as he and his wife wanted. The
Dispatch interviewed the father Monday but did not identify him.
   The newspaper gave this account of how the trap was sprung:
   On the night of Friday, Aug. 5 _ the same day of the week and
the same time of day their daughter was attacked _ the mother was
standing on the corner just east of downtown, when a man parked his
car and walked toward her.
   The attacker grabbed her, dragged her toward nearby Franklin
Park and drew a gun. The woman's husband ran from his car, also
drew a gun and said: ``Freeze! Police!''
   The attacker ran to his car and fled.
   The husband wrote down the car's license plate and called
police. The license number was traced to a car owned by Biddings,
who was arrested after police searched his apartment.
   The charges against Biddings relate to the case involving the
couple's daughter.
   So far, Biddings has been linked to 19 additional attacks, said
police Capt. Antone Lanata.
   ``The victims have picked him out of a photo display, or by
physical evidence _ fingerprints,'' Lanata said. Interviews with
other victims were continuing, he said.
   Evidence against Biddings will be presented to a Franklin County
grand jury, accompanied by requests for indictments on 60 counts of
rape and more than 100 other miscellaneous felony counts, Ms.
Pangborn said.
   The attacks occurred throughout the city, police said.

   Rescue workers coped with aftershocks
and heavy rain today in an effort to reach remote regions of the
Himalayas to help victims of an earthquake whose official death
toll neared 700.
   Rumors predicting another large quake sent thousands of
panic-stricken people fleeing from their homes in India and Nepal.
   Sunday's pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and
claimed at least 497 lives in Nepal and 200 in India, government
officials said.
   Officials in both countries said they expected the death toll to
climb when reports arrived from regions difficult to reach even in
good weather.
   The quake injured at least 2,000 people in India and 1,000 in
Nepal, officials said.
   In Biratnagar, a city near the Indian border 150 miles east of
the Nepalese capital Katmandu, residents poured into the streets
before dawn today as men ran from houses to house, shouting that a
message came from Katmandu that a new quake was expected before
dawn.
   Police in the city of 300,000 people said they received no such
message.
   ``I have tried to tell them they are making a mistake, but no
one will listen to me,'' said Dabal Singh, an inspector.
   Anonymous telephone calls with similar rumors roused hundreds of
people in Katmandu, also before dawn. Sunday's quake was felt in
the capital, but no deaths or serious damage were reported in the
city.
   In Patna, India, thousands of people huddled in the rain in open
courtyards Monday as rumors swept the city that another quake was
imminent. Patna is the capital of Bihar state, the worst hit area
in India.
   A quake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale shook eastern Nepal
late Monday afternoon, but there were no immediate reports of new
casualties or damage.
   In general, however, the intensity of aftershocks has lessened.
   ``Compared to the ones on Sunday and Monday, they have been
declining,'' Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepal's
Department of Geology, said in Katmandu. He said most aftershocks
had declined to a reading of 1 on the Richter scale.
   Rain continued in quake-affected areas, hampering access on
muddy roads already cracked by the quake. Landslides blocked many
roads to devastated areas. Railroad tracks sank into the mud, and
the quake also cracked bridges over rivers swollen by the monsoon.
   In India, the area with the greatest damage and casualties was
just south of the border in Bihar, India's poorest state.
   News reports said 400 people died in Bihar state, double the
Indian government's count. Bihar officials said the reports were
exaggerated, while opposition politicians in the state accused the
government of suppressing information and claimed the death toll
was close to 1,500.
   Tremors flattened more than 25,000 houses in India, officials
said, and the Bhoothai Balan River flooded nearly 50 villages in
the Madhubani district.
   Indian army soldiers helped with relief efforts, and the navy
and air force were put on alert. Nepalese soldiers, police and
volunteers joined forces in the kingdom's remote mountains and
valleys.
   Niranjan Thapa of the Home Minstry reported extensive damage in
21 of Nepal's 75 districts and at least four affected districts
reported 50 or more deaths.
   Officials distributed 88-pound bags of rice to families in this
kingdom of 17 million people.
   Government officials said many offers of assistance had come
from abroad, but no decision had been made about whether to accept
them.
   A U.S. Embassy official said the embassy had offered $25,000 in
immediate aid but had not received a response.
   The quake was the worst in the region since a temblor in India's
eastern state of Assam killed 1,500 people in 1950, according to
official accounts. Seismologists said their records showed a death
toll of at least 30,000.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs and each number represents aa tenflod increaase in
intensity. A quake of 6 on the scale is capable of causing severe
damage, while one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

   Some of the six Cuban-Americans indicted on charges
they trained and supplied mercenaries to the Contras through a
Florida guerrilla camp say their fight in Nicaragua supported U.S.
interests.
   The Miami-area men were the second group charged by a Fort
Lauderdale federal grand jury with violating the Neutrality Act,
which bars people on U.S. soil from launching operations against a
government at peace with the United States. The latest indictment
was unsealed Monday.
   One of the six, Rene Corvo, also is accused of shipping a 20mm
cannon, a mortar and other weapons from Fort Lauderdale to Contra
bases in Costa Rica under the guise of humanitarian aid.
   After a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Lurana Snow in
Fort Lauderdale, some of the defendants echoed sentiments of the
group whose indictment was unsealed a month ago.
   ``We support the Contras,'' Sergio Becerra, accused of training
the mercenaries in the camp near Naples, Fla., yelled as he emerged
from the federal courthouse.
   ``These men were simply following the orders of their commander
in chief,'' said Corvo's lawyer, A.P. Walter. ``They feel it is the
duty of every American citizen to oppose communism.''
   Kirk Munroe, attorney for one of the men who allegedly financed
the operation, Eulalio Francisco ``Frank'' Castro, said his client
was ``disappointed in the indictment.''
   Castro would again aid the Contras if asked, Munroe said.
   ``I think it will become clear that these men were acting in the
interests of the United States and the interests of freedom-loving
people everywhere,'' Munroe said.
   Also financing the mercenary camp along with Castro was Joseph
Marcos, according to the indictment.
   ``Right now we really don't understand the charges,'' Marcos
said, calling them ``very unfair.''
   Corvo agreed, calling the Neutrality Act case ``very
ridiculous.''
   All four were released without bond. The two remaining
defendants, Rafael Torres Jimenez and Francisco Hernandez, were out
of the country, and federal authorities were attempting to contact
them, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Schnapp said.
   Corvo faces up to 38 years in prison if convicted on the weapons
charges and counts of violating the Neutrality Act and conspiring
to violate it. The remaining five men face up to eight years in
prison on the latter two charges.
   According to the indictment, the six men financed and trained
Cuban-American and Nicaraguan mercenaries, most from the Miami
area, at a camp that could handle up to 60 soldiers at a time. Some
of the men saw combat inside Nicaragua after crossing the border
from Costa Rica, Schnapp said.
   The men allegedly worked with Eden Pastora, the maverick Contra
commander who has since quit the movement, and ran the camp from
June 1983 to September 1986. The camp was a poorly kept secret and
was filmed in 1985 by a Naples-area television station, Schnapp
said.
   Members of an earlier group of Contra supporters indicted by the
same grand jury on Neutrality Act charges included Mario Calero _
the brother of Contra leader Adolfo Calero _ and Tom Posey, head of
the Alabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance.
   One defendant, Joe Adams, a former Adolfo Calero associate,
pleaded guilty to the charges but was given a one-day probation
sentence by U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger.
   The other defendants said they were supported by the Reagan
administration and that the United States was in a de facto state
of war with Nicaragua at the time they aided the rebels.
   Schnapp said the new indictment did not include any evidence
that the men were acting on behalf of the Reagan administration.
``The indictment would indicate that they were not sanctioned,''
said Schnapp.

<TEXT>
   Officials from North and South Korea
plan to meet Wednesday to try and break a logjam in talks over the
Olympic Games and a non-aggression pact, a government spokesman
said today.
   The spokesman for Park Joon-kyu, South Korea's chief delegate to
the talks, said Park will meet his communist counterpart, Chon Kum
Chol, at the Panmunjom truce site, which straddles the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
   The meeting was to be private, said the spokesman. No news media
was to be allowed.
   The north and the south have met three times since Friday in an
unsuccesssful attempt to agree on an agenda for joint parliamentary
talks. Park indicated after the last round Monday that no further
talks were likely until after the Olympic Games in Seoul from Sept.
17-Oct 2.
   North Korea is demanding to co-host the Games. It also wants the
two sides to agree on terms for a joint non-aggression pact.
   The north has said it will boycott the Games unless it is
allowed to co-host the event. South Korea fears the north may
resort to terrorist attacks to disrupt the Olympics if its demand
is not met.
   The south, which has said that co-hosting is impossible, wants
the north to agree to urgent talks to try and resolve the Olympic
issue, leaving other subjects until after the Games. South Korea
says it wants its communist rival to take part in the Games.
   This morning, South Korea's National Assembly said the north
asked for a chief delegate's meeting at the border, giving the
south's team just 35 minues to get there. The meeting could not be
held because Panmunjom is more than an hour's drive from Seoul. The
two sides agreed to meet Wednesday.
   North Korea is insisting on full-scale talks involving the full
parliaments of both sides, plus representatives of various social
and class groups. It also wants the Olympics and a non-aggression
pact to be the main items for discussion.
   The south contends that talks involving the full legislatures
would be unworkable and wants delegations of up to 30 lawmakers. It
also wants to discuss a broad range of issues, including
humanitarian, political and economic exchanges.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by Soviet and U.S.
forces, ending the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.
North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War,
which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being
signed.

   Two former attorneys for one-time lobbyist
Paula Parkinson say she told the FBI in 1981 that GOP vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle propositioned her during a Florida
trip, but she refused, according to a published report.
   In a copyright story in today's editions of the Daily News of
Los Angeles, the attorneys said Ms. Parkinson told the FBI the
request was made when she, Quayle _ then a congressman _ and two
other legislators shared a cottage during the 1980 golfing trip,
the lawyers said.
   Quayle, an Indiana senator who has been married since 1972, has
said he did not have an affair with Ms. Parkinson, and a campaign
spokesman declined comment Monday evening about the lawyers'
allegations.
   Efforts to find Ms. Parkinson on Monday were unsuccessful, the
newspaper said.
   The two lawyers represented Ms. Parkinson when she was
questioned on March 28, 1981, by the FBI during an investigation of
whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation.
The lawyers reviewed their notes of the FBI interview for the Daily
News during separate telephone interviews Monday.
   Ms. Parkinson has said that at the time of the trip, she was
with Rep. Tom Evans, R-Del., who lost his re-election bid in 1982.
   ``Paula reported to the FBI during the investigation of the
lobbying scandal that Quayle was interested in her, flirted with
her and asked her to go to bed with him,'' said Washington attorney
Glenn Lewis, referring to his notes from the FBI interview of Ms.
Parkinson.
   ``She indicated at that time that she couldn't (respond to his
overture) because she was with Congressman Evans,'' Lewis told the
newspaper.
   Washington attorney Roy Kinsey, who also was present during the
interview, said his paraphrased notes show that she told the FBI,
``Quayle made a pass, and said he would like to sleep with'' her.
   According to Kinsey's notes, Ms. Parkinson told the FBI that she
rejected Quayle's suggestion, saying, ``No, I'm with Tom (Evans).''
   Mark Goodin, deputy press secretary for the Bush-Quayle
campaign, was told of the lawyers' comments Monday evening.
   ``I think you've got a huge rumor mill out there churning this
stuff out, and until I have something laid before me that is
substantially more than a rumor, I can't comment,'' Goodin said.
   The lobbying investigation centered on Ms. Parkinson, a lobbyist
for an insurance industry group that opposed legislation to set up
a national farm crop insurance program. The bill passed the House
in September 1980, with Quayle, Evans and the third member of the
Florida trip _ Rep. Tom Railsback, R-Ill. _ voting against it.
   The three Republican congressmen shared a house with Ms.
Parkinson during the January 1980 golfing trip to Atlantis, Fla.
   FBI spokesman Greg Jones refused comment Monday on the
7-year-old interview.
   Kinsey said his 20 pages of notes of the interview paraphrase
Ms. Parkinson stating that she and Evans shared one room, and that
Quayle was in another.
   The Justice Department, which conducted the investigation of Ms.
Parkinson's relationships with the members of Congress, dropped its
case in August 1981 without filing any charges.
   Lewis and Kinsey said they have not talked to Ms. Parkinson for
several years.
   Meanwhile, Jonathan Black, managing editor of Playboy magazine,
said Monday that Parkinson would have ``new comments'' about events
at the Florida cottage in text accompanying a ``Women of
Washington'' pictorial in the November issue of the magazine. Ms.
Parkinson will appear nude in the pictorial.
   Black said the article was originally written long before Quayle
was named as Vice President George Bush's running mate, but that
``new material'' from Parkinson was inserted last week. The
magazine is scheduled to be on the newsstands Oct. 1.
   The Dallas Morning News reported that Ms. Parkinson, who is
divorced, uses her maiden name, Paula Laham, and lives in an
apartment in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite.
   ``She doesn't want to talk to anyone today,'' a woman at the
apartment told the newspaper Monday.
   The former lobbyist was arrested twice in 1985 for public
intoxication, the News reported. One case was dismissed, but she
received 90 days probation on the other.
   She was placed on two years probation last December after
pleading guilty to a charge of driving while under the influence.

   The communist government today announced a
special parliament session would be held Aug. 31 to review its
economic policies and said it would continue measures to stem the
worst strikes since the 1981 imposition of martial law.
   Authorities earlier announced a curfew tonight on Jastrzebie,
the city at the center of strikes that began a week ago and spread
to coal mines, factories, ports and transportation facilities
employing 100,000 people.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, saying at least 20 illegal
strikes have threatened anarchy in the country, announced Monday
that law enforcement forces would secure major industrial
facilities and that he had empowered provinces to impose curfews in
the Katowice, Szczecin and Gdansk areas.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, who announced the date of the
parliament meeting at a news conference today, said the session
would consider the entire economic situation and perhaps make
adjustments in national price and income policies.
   Strikers have demanded higher pay and reinstatement of
Solidarity, the outlawed independent trade federation.
   Urban said there have been 49 detentions by police nationwide in
connection with the strikes, most of them ``preventative.''
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today again appealed for talks
between authorities and his union.
   ``Solidarity remains steadfast in its search for dialogue
despite the growing social tensions,'' he said on a tape brought
out of the strikebound Lenin shipyard in Gdansk where he spent the
night. ``The present situation in the country has become extremely
serious. The just protest of the workers must not be ignored.''
   Urban told reporters talks with Walesa were impossible while
strikes were going on.
   New strikes began at two coal mines Monday night and there was a
brief work stoppage today at the Nowa Huta steel mill near Krakow,
authorities said.
   The state-run news agency PAP reported that workers voluntarily
ended a strike today at a railroad car factory in Wroclaw.
Solidarity sources in Wroclaw said earlier that the strike was
continuing.
   Partial streetcar traffic resumed in the port city of Szczecin
today after police dislodged strikers from depots Monday night,
according to PAP, but bus service still was affected by a strike.
Army troops were operating buses.
   The 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was announced for Jastrzebie, site of
the first coal mine strike Aug. 16 and headquarters of the
Inter-Mine Strike Committee, by Katowice provincial spokesman
Ryszard Gil. The province is Poland's industrial and mining center.
   In the first forcible action against strikers, riot police
evicted scores from two streetcar depots and a bus depot Monday
night in Szczecin, and strike leaders said more than 150 people
were arrested.
   On Monday night, Kiszczak said authorities were dutybound to
prevent the return to ``the situation before 1981,'' when they
imposed martial law to crush Solidarity.
   The speech came after workers at the Lenin shipyard launched
their second strike of the year. Dockworkers in the Baltic port
also began a sit-in strike Monday.
   Solidarity leaders said they were joined by workers at several
of Poland's largest factories, including the Ursus tractor plant
and the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw, the Cegielski turbine
works in Poznan and the Stalowa Wola heavy machinery plant in
southeastern Poland.
   The government has refused to negotiate with Solidarity, the
only free trade union movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc. It
was outlawed in 1982.
   Kiszczak said he authorized officials in the provinces of
Szczecin, Gdansk and Katowice to impose curfews to keep the peace.
   He said he had also directed security forces ``to strengthen
external protection'' around factories and prevent outsiders from
entering the plants.
   The army was dispatched to ``assure the continuity of city
transport everywhere it has been immobilized,'' and courts were
advised to send violators of the peace to jail in summary
proceedings rather than merely fining them.
   He said the strikes were being carried out by only a minority of
workers, but had dire consequences for the economy.
   Strike leaders said they were girding for possible police raids.
   ``We are prepared for these gentlemen's visit,'' a grim Jozef
Kowalczyk, spokesman for striking dockworkers in Szczecin, said
early today. ``The crew is so determined that they (police) had
better not do it. We have two priests here and they've heard our
confessions.''
   Kiszczak said 5,000 militant miners had prevented 65,000 miners
willing to work from entering coal mines and said Baltic docks were
losing valuable business to East and West Germany.
   Coal exports are crucial to service Poland's $39 billion foreign
debt.
   ``The law is being broken again and the specter of anarchy is
rising again. People are asking fearful questions: `Where is all
this heading?''' said Kiszczak, a general who commands the
country's police forces.
   A less serious series of strikes occurred in Poland in late
April and May after the government raised prices an average of 40
percent, with strikers at the Gdansk shipyard quitting without a
settlement and police breaking up the Nowa Huta stoppage.
   Three times in post-war Communist Poland, labor unrest stemming
in part from price increases has toppled governments: in 1956, 1970
and 1980.

<HEAD>Refugees Say Military Participated In Massacre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The military in Burundi took part in
massacres that have left at least 5,000 people dead and caused
38,000 to flee to neighboring Rwanda, a U.N. official quoted
refugees as saying today.
   ``What they told me was that they were fleeing persecution from
the military and we saw many people who had been injured by bullets
and bayonets,'' said Code Cisse, a U.N. representative in Rwanda's
capital, Kigali.
   Burundi's military is dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe,
which has been fighting the majority Hutu tribe. The Hutu People
Liberation Party, an exiled opposition group, has charged that
Burundi's military massacred thousands of Hutus.
   Burundi's government has denied the accusations. It claims the
slaughter last week was instigated by exiled Hutus who infiltrated
the tiny central African country to inflame anti-Tutsi sentiments.
   ``What the government did was restore peace,'' said an official
communique issued Monday by Burundi's foreign minister, Cyprien
Mbonimpa.
   The Hutu and the Tutsi are longtime enemies. Following an
abortive coup attempt in 1972 in Burundi, a former colony of
Belgium, the Tutsi massacred more than 100,000 Hutu including most
of the tribe's intelligentsia, according to human rights groups.
   Western diplomats in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, said there
were ethnic disturbances earlier this month in the northern region
where the slaughter occurred, but the government felt it had
succeeded in calming the situation.
   ``The killing seems to have caught everybody by surprise,'' said
one diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It could lend
credence to the government's claim there had been infiltrators
trying to stir things up.''
   Most of the killings occurred around the remote farming communes
of Ntega and Marangara in northern Burundi, a hilly, marshy area
that has been sealed off by the military.
   ``News has been very, very difficult to come by,'' the diplomat
said. ``But from all that we have been able to gather, the army
moved in after the initial mass killing had occurred and was
instructed to fire only upon those carrying arms or threatening
other people.''
   Although Burundi claims it has restored peace to the area, the
U.N. official said peasants still were fleeing across the border
with Rwanda at an average of 5,000 per day, and the refugees had
numbered 38,000 by Monday.
   He said the majority of refugees were Hutu.
   Cisse, who represents the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
said urgent international assistance was needed to help Rwanda cope
with the influx. He said the immediate requirements were blankets,
medicines and tents to accomodate the refugees, many of whom were
sleeping in the open.
   ``The conditions are very bad,'' he said. ``They are located in
a region where there is a high risk of malaria and are being housed
in schools and health clinics. We can't meet the need.''
   Rwanda and Burundi are among the world's most densely populated
countries.
   Nearly 5 million people live in Burundi, which covers an area
about the size of Maryland. Eighty-four percent of its people are
Hutu, while 15 percent are Tutsi. The same percentages apply to the
approximately 6 million people in Rwanda, which covers a slightly
smaller area.
   In an official communique Monday, the government of Burundi
promised to work with refugees who fled to Rwanda to try to return
them to their homes as soon as possible.
   The government has restricted travel between towns, enforced a 7
p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew throughout the country and banned meetings of
more than five people.
   The massacre, in which the government has said 5,000 have died,
was the first outbreak of violence since Maj. Pierre Buyoya seized
power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987 while former President
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza was in Canada.

   An explosion shattered a
fast-food restaurant today in the coastal city of East London,
injuring at least 25 people, police said.
   Major Trevor Hayes, a police spokesman, said no one was killed.
He said the cause of the blast was not known.
   The explosion occurred about 1:15 p.m. at a Wimpy hamburger
restaurant in East London's central business area.
   Witneses said they heard screams from the restaurant and saw
injured people being taken away by rescue workers. Hayes said he
did not know how many of the victims were seriously hurt.
   Police have blamed the outlawed African National Congress for a
recent series of bombings in civilian areas. The ANC said last week
that some civilian targets had been attacked by guerrillas acting
against their leaders' instructions.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrown the
South African government and end apartheid.

   A ferry capsized and sank in the

people dead and 58 missing, officials said today.
   They said 117 people were on board the ferry ML Shikha when it
sank Monday near the town of Barisal, about 120 miles south of
Dhaka. Officials said the vessel was built to carry up to 35 people.
   Nine people drowned and 50 swam to shore, according to the

   Annual monsoon rains, which cause many rivers to overflow, began

<HEAD>Swiss Specialist: Mandela in `Excellent Health' Despite TB</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss lung specialist who examined
Nelson Mandela said today the imprisoned leader of the African
National Congress was in excellent health despite tuberculosis.
   ``I can say that the state of health (of Mandela) is simply
excellent,'' Professor Heinrich Herzog told Swiss Radio
International.
   Herzog, until recently president of the European Society of
Pleurology, said Mandela told him he ``was in perfect health, and
felt as well as before the whole thing started.''
   He said the 70-year-old black leader ``looks rather a bit
younger'' than his age, adding: ``He no longer looks ill.''
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, announced last week that his
client was suffering from TB. He said Mandela was short of breath,
had a persistent cough and that his speech was impaired.
   Herzog saw Mandela at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town. He did
not specify when he examined Mandela, but indicated it was after an
Aug. 13 biopsy that showed no sign of malignancy in Mandela's left
lung.
   Hospital officials had said that Herzog was examining Mandela,
but did not specify who invited him to do so.
   On Aug. 12, Mandela was transferred to Tygerberg hospital from
Pollsmoor Prison, where he is serving a life term for sabotage and
conspiracy to overthrow the government. He was imprisoned in 1962.
   Herzog said he had ``no political talks'' with Mandela. But he
said comments in the South African media and ``indirect remarks,
which obviously originate at a higher level, leave the impression
that the (Pretoria) government may make use of the situation to set
him free.''
   In Cape Town, the medical superintendent at Tygerberg, Dr.
J.G.L. Strauss, said today that Mandela was recovering ``faster
than he expected.'' The doctor said Mandela was sitting up in bed,
reading newspapers and listening to the radio.
   Helen Suzman, an opponent of apartheid who is the
longest-serving member of South Africa's Parliament, said she would
introduce a motion Wednesday urging Mandela's release.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the
South African government and end apartheid, the system of racial
segregation in which South Africa's black majority has no vote in
national affairs.

<TEXT>
   The Iran-Iraq peace talks starting Thursday are
only one set of negotiations that bolster Geneva's century-old
tradition as a city of peace.
   A day earlier, Greek and Turkish factions from Cyprus open two
days of meetings in a new attempt to resolve the political future
of the island divided by war.
   Both sets of talks are brokered by the United Nations, which has
its European base at the former League of Nations building.
   The Palace of Nations hosts about 8,000 meetings a year, helping
make Geneva the world's conference capital.
   The heavy U.N. focus is likely to overshadow a third major
meeting on the city's neutral ground: a U.S.-Soviet review of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, whose outcome could affect
superpower arms reduction talks.
   The ``Geneva spirit'' saw a renaissance this year with the
completion of a U.S.-Soviet treaty scrapping intermediate-range
missiles and the signing of a U.N.-backed accord setting a Soviet
troop pullout from Afghanistan.
   Those agreements took years to complete, a fate that may befall
the Iran-Iraq talks, called to settle points of conflict after both
sides accepted a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   International negotiations have marked Geneva's history for 116
years, since the settlement of a controversy arising from the U.S.
Civil War.
   At dispute in 1872 were heavy losses inflicted on 22 Union ships
by a British-equipped Confederate frigate, the Alabama. The United
States and Britain agreed to international arbitration and a Geneva
tribunal ruled Britain should pay the United States $15.5 million
in damages.
   Nine years earlier, Henry Dunant, a Geneva native, launched the
idea for the Red Cross. The International Red Cross today is based
in Geneva.
   Hopes were high in 1919 when Geneva was chosen to be the host of
the League of Nations. But in the 1930s, the League could do little
to prevent Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany or Italy's war
in Ethiopia.
   It collapsed in World War II.
   The United Nations made Geneva its European center in 1946. Most
U.N.-affiliated agencies have headquarters in the city, including
the World Health Organization and the International
Telecommunication Union.
   Superpower efforts to ban all chemical weapons and nuclear tests
have gone on for years in Geneva.
   Washington and Moscow often have extolled the Geneva spirit
after the first summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985 signaled a new phase in superpower
relations.
   In April, the superpowers signed the U.N. agreement on
Afghanistan after six years of negotiations.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze returned to Geneva a month later to settle final
details of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which was
signed in Washington in last year. U.S.-Soviet talks on cutting
long-range nuclear arsenals are continuing.
   Earlier this month, representatives of South Africa, Angola and
Cuba met in Geneva under U.S. mediation and agreed on first
concrete moves to end the civil war in Angola and declare
independence for South-West Africa. But a complete peace package
still seems a way off.
   Geneva was the launching pad for international arbitration
between Chile and Argentina on the century-old Beagle Channel
dispute and between Egypt and Israel over competing claims to the
Taba strip.
   Pope John Paul II's mediation was needed before a
Chile-Argentina settlement was signed in 1982. The Taba judges,
inaugurated in 1986, are still deliberating.
   Many meetings ended inconclusively or in failure, such as an
18-nation conference aimed at organizing free elections in both
Koreas, the 1973-75 European Conference on Security and Cooperation
and a national reconciliation conference between Lebanon's feuding
factions.
   The 1955 Geneva summit with the United States, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union failed to ease cold war tensions.
   Through the ups and downs of diplomacy, negotiators from all
over the world keep flocking to this city.
   ``No other world city is characterized by as total a calm, as
total an absence of political passion in matters of international
politics,'' former U.S. diplomat George Wynne wrote during his
1970s posting in Geneva.

   President Daniel Ortega says the U.S.
Democratic and Republican parties are ``imperialist'' because each
had an assistance plan for Nicaraguan rebels fighting to overthrow
his government.
   Ortega said Monday he doubted the inauguration of a new American
administration next year would improve U.S.-Nicaraguan relations
but held out hope a Democratic administration under Michael Dukakis
would seek negotiations.
   ``What we have said is that a future U.S. government _ Democrat
or Republican, both have shown themselves to be imperialist _ be
responsible and wise enough to have learned the lesson (President)
Reagan would leave them,'' he said.
   Both parties ``have their own plan for aid to the Contras'' and
``aren't satisfied that there exists a sovereign, free and
independent government in Nicaragua,'' Ortega said.
   The United States has supported the rebels, known as Contras,
since 1981.
   U.S. military aid for the rebels expired in February. On Aug.
10, the Senate voted largely along party lines for a Democratic
proposal to provide the Contras with $27 million in non-lethal
humanitarian aid after Oct. 1 and a possible second vote on $16.3
million in stockpiled military aid later this year.
   A cease-fire has been in effect since March 21, but talks on a
permanent truce to the civil war broke down in June. Each side has
accused the other of violating the truce.
   Ortega said if Dukakis is elected president and ``is capable of
executing (plans) to enter negotiated solutions, he would be giving
the United States the opportunity to vindicate itself before the
people of Latin America.''
   Ortega made his remarks during a ceremony marking the 10th
anniversary of the seizure of the National Palace by Sandinista
guerrillas fighting the government of the late President Anastasio
Somoza.
   In the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, six Nicaraguan exiles
staged a peaceful protest inside their country's embassy to demand
greater democratization in Nicaragua.
   The six men, representing a group called the United Front of
Mestizos of the Nicaraguan Atlantic Coast, said they were
protesting what they called the Sandinista government's failure to
fulfill a year-old regional peace accord.
   Among other measures, the treaty commits Central American
governments to make democratic reforms and negotiate peaceful
solutions to insurgencies.

<HEAD>Cardenas Files Charges Against Election Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas filed
criminal charges against two top election officials, accusing them
of failing to release results of the July 6 elections from nearly
half of Mexico's voting stations.
   In his petition, presented Monday night, Cardenas said Manuel
Bartlett Diaz, president of the Federal Election Commission and
interior minister, and Fernando Elias Calles, the commission
secretary, violated the electoral code by not releasing results
from at least 24,000 polling stations.
   More than 18 million Mexicans cast ballots at about 55,000
stations, according to the Election Commission.
   ``We asked that the (vote) information be made known and that
the authorities fulfill their responsibility,'' said Cardenas,
presidential candidate of the National Democratic Front coalition.
   Elias Calles rejected Cardenas' claims and presented a
multi-party election committee with a computer printout of the
national vote for the Chamber of Deputies.
   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari won 50.36 percent of
the vote in official returns to 31.12 percent for Cardenas and
17.07 for Manuel Clouthier of the conservative National Action
Party.
   ``In this commission we have never hidden (vote) information,''
Elias Calles said.
   In an incident Sunday, soldiers carrying automatic rifles
stopped about 150 opposition representatives from entering a room
at the Legislative Palace where millions of ballots are kept. The
army is required to guard the ballots until the election is
certified.
   The deputies-elect said the ballots would prove opposition
charges that the PRI rigged the election.
   Earlier Monday, the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI, assured the nation a new Chamber of Deputies will be
certified by Sept. 1.
   The outgoing president customarily introduces his successor to
the nation on Sept. 1 during his final state-of-the-union address.
The new president is sworn in Dec. 1.
   Mexican presidents serve single, six-year terms beginning Dec.
1. The PRI has won every presidential election since it was created
in 1929.
   On Monday, Cardenas' National Front suffered two defections to
the governing party.
   Lucia Santes, a Front leader in southeastern Tabasco state, said
in announcing her defection she had been the object of ``low blows,
envy and rancor'' and that the PRI ``represents the real option for
change.''
   Amalio Salinas Munoz, a 36-year PRI veteran before resigning to
become a Front senate candidate in central Morelos state, asked to
be welcomed back to the governing party ranks, the PRI said.
   A party statement quoted Salinas Munoz as saying he had been
``threatened with death by those who claim to be (Front) leaders in
Morelos.''

   An initiation for incoming Boulder High
School sophomore girls allegedly involved girls smearing themselves
with chicken excrement and torturing chickens to death, a newspaper
reported today.
   Up to 10 chickens may have been killed or injured, according to
accounts given to The Boulder Daily Camera by students and other
witnesses who were at the mall Sunday evening.
   However, police did not report any evidence of such activity.
Hal Nees, division chief of patrol, said three officers were sent
and apparently did not find that chickens were being killed because
they took no enforcement action.
   Initiating sophomores is a longstanding tradition in Boulder.
   Some initiators threw chickens high into the air to fall on
sophomores who were grouped in a circle, or onto the pavement, the
newspaper said.
   One sophomore, who asked that her name not be used, told the
newspaper that initiators took her group of six girls to a park and
forced them to smear fresh chicken excrement on each other. In
addition, the initiators made the girls kiss a beef tongue which
was dripping blood, she said.
   Boulder High School principal Marcy McMillan called on Monday
for an investigation by police and the Boulder County Humane
Society. ``We are strongly opposed to any kind of initiation,'' she
said.
   Sally Shelton of Atlanta, visiting for her son's University of
Colorado freshman orientation, said she saw 10 girls doing
cartwheels while holding chickens by the neck.
   ``Those girls looked frightened, and they looked like they were
in a sort of a stupor,'' she said.

   Tens of thousands of people marched
through Rangoon today to denounce one-party rule in the largest
protest in Burma's capital since rioting toppled President Sein
Lwin, a diplomat said.
   The Western diplomat said he saw more than 50,000 people march
peacefully through downtown streets chanting anti-government
slogans. It was the second major demonstration in the capital in as
many days.
   ``Down with Socialism!'' and ``Welcome Democracy!'' shouted
about 2,000 demonstrators outside the U.S. Embassy, said the
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Mandalay, Burma's second largest city, some 200,000 people
took part in anti-government demonstrations, Japan's Kyodo news
service said.
   The diplomat in Rangoon said soldiers withdrew from the downtown
area this morning and the crowd swelled enormously with doctors and
nurses in their uniforms, artists, writers, and lawyers joining the
students, Buddhist monks, and other people who have been rallying
for an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule.
   ``The government seems to have been reduced to its leaders and
its troops,'' the diplomat said of a similar protest Monday.
   Today's demonstration was the largest in Rangoon since bloody
rioting Aug. 8-12 forced Sein Lwin's resignation after 17 days in
power. Maung Maung, the attorney general, assumed power Friday as
the country's first civilian leader in a quarter century.
   Protesters have continued rallies calling for the end of the
exclusive rule of the Burma Socialist Program Party, a
military-dominated autocracy whose rigid policies have turned one
of Southeast Asia's richest nations into one of the world's poorest.
   On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of
Rangoon, Mandalay, the second-largest city, and other towns in
response to student calls for protests and a nationwide general
strike.
   Some demonstrators in Rangoon tried to march to the Sule Pagoda,
a rallying point for protest, but were peacefully stopped by
barbed-wire and other barricades and some of the three divisions of
troops deployed in the capital, diplomats said.
   Diplomats said Monday's show of military force in the capital
reflected the government's position that while accommodating
demands for significant economic reforms, it would not institute
political changes that would erode its power.
   The Western diplomat said the demonstrations present authorities
with a dilemma: the demonstrations will mushroom if they do not use
force to contain them, but force also brings the distinct
possibility of violence like that which led to the resignation Sein
Lwin.
   By official count, 112 people were killed in Rangoon and 267
wounded as security forces repeatedly opened fire to disperse the
tens of thousands who marched against the hardline former army
general.
   Since Sein Lwin's Aug. 12 resignation, there have been no
reports of violence in the rallies and the government has indicated
it will be much more tolerant of open dissent.
   More than 500 people arrested during the rioting have been freed
by the new government. Among those still held are Aung Gyi, the
country's leading dissident, and Sein Win, the Burma correspondent
of The Associated Press, both arrested in a sweep in Rangoon July
29-30.
   AP President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi sent a telex
to Maung Maung today urging Sein Win's release.
   ``It is our strongly felt hope that one of the first acts of
your new administration will be the release of our correspondent,''
Boccardi said in the telex. He said Sein Win, 66, has worked for
the AP for two decades and there was no indication he was involved
in anti-government activities, as authorities have claimed.
   On Monday, a man claiming to represent 16 Burmese university
student unions said the coalition's president, Maung Maung Kwaw,
had come to Bangkok seeking weapons from rebels fighting the
Burmese government.
   Also Monday, the Karen National Union, one of the strongest
ethnic-based guerrilla groups fighting the Burmese government for
greater autonomy, issued a statement in Bangkok declaring support
for the students and calling on foreign nations to halt aid to the
government until it ends one-party rule.
   Burma has been in turmoil since September, when university
students rioted in the country's most serious unrest since 1974.
They were protesting the government's voiding of 60 percent of the
currency, a move that dashed savings and hopes in a nation whose
average per capita income is less than $200.
   Demonstrations, increasingly focused on political demands,
occurred in March and June, and Sein Lwin is said to have
personally ordered them brutally suppressed.
   Rioting resumed in late July after Sein Lwin succeeded Ne Win,
who had ruled since leading a 1962 coup toppled democracy.
   The demonstrations became bloody when troops fired on crowds and
some protesters fought back. Diplomats believe the death toll was
much higher than official figures.

<HEAD>Judge Orders New Permit Process For Migrant Workers In Southeast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An estimated 20,000 undocumented farm workers in
the Southeast will get another opportunity to obtain legal status
and remove the threat of deportation.
   In a temporary injunction issued Monday, Senior U.S. District
Court Judge C. Clyde Atkins concluded the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service was too restrictive in demanding payroll
stubs from migrant workers seeking work-residency permits under a
special government amnesty program.
   ``The evidence before this court strongly suggests that, despite
congressional directives, applicants are being required to produce
exactly what they cannot: payroll records,'' Atkins wrote in a
40-page ruling.
   The mostly Haitian and Mexican workers in Florida, Alabama and
Georgia were often paid in cash, and field crew bosses often keep
insufficient employee records, Atkins said.
   The INS last September stopped accepting employer affidavits and
required payroll stubs as proof that laborers worked the minimum
90-day period to qualify for the permits. Without the permits, the
workers faced explusion from the United States.
   INS officials disallowed the affidavits because of concerns over
fraud.
   Service administrators were not in the office this morning.
   ``Congress intended that the program be liberally applied to
encourage undocumented farm workers to come forward and seek
legalization,'' Atkins wrote.
   The ruling also requires INS to give temporary permits to farm
workers whose applications were not accepted at local offices due
to lack of payroll stubs and give all laborers a chance to get an
official explanation of their rejection.
   The INS also was ordered to provide Spanish and Creole
translators to assist workers with the applications.
   ``I am really elated by this. We were hoping for something
exactly like this,'' said Sheryl Little, an attorney with the
Haitian Refugee Center in Miami, one of the principal plaintiffs in
the suit that went to trial earlier this summer.
   Ms. Little estimated 20,000 workers in the three states will be
affected by the ruling. The plaintiffs, which also included the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach County and individual migrant
workers, decided to seek a regional case rather than try for a
nationwide ruling.
   ``This is a nationwide problem, but we wanted to try it here
first,'' she said.

   Two Estonian scholars today called for greater
economic independence from Moscow for their republic on the 49th
anniversary of an agreement that led to the Soviet takeover of
Estonia and two other republics.
   Activists said thousands of demonstrators from Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia were planning to commemorate the signing on Aug. 23,
1939, of a secret non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and
Nazi Germany.
   The pact divided Eastern Europe into spheres of Soviet and
German influence and led to the Soviet takeover of the three
independent Baltic republics a year later. Soviet officials say the
pact bought their country a crucial two years to prepare for war
with Germany.
   Activists in Latvia and Lithuania told The Associated Press that
authorities have granted them permission for outdoor meetings for
the purpose of recalling the victims of dictator Josef Stalin's
purges. But they said demonstrators undoubtedly would use the
gatherings to mark the signing of the non-aggression pact.
   Mikhail Bombin, correspondent for the dissident journal
Express-Chronicle, said 10,000-25,000 people were expected at a
rally in the Latvian port of Riga.
   Valdas Analauskas, the journal's correspondent in Lithuania,
said a large crowd gathered Monday night in the central square in
the capital of Vilnius and surrounded about 40 people on a hunger
strike in support of Lithuanian political prisoners. He said there
had been no action by authorities to break up the protest.
   Authorities have granted permission for a gathering in a central
Vilnius park tonight, Analauskas said.
   Philosopher Edgar Savisaar and economist I. Raig, writing in
today's edition of the newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura, called for
Estonia and other republics to be given full responsibility for
managing their economies. Estonia is politically and economically
controlled by the Kremlin.
   ``The government is strong when all of its parts are strong; the
parts are strong when they receive the right to be strong. Only
then will both, the parts and the whole, win,'' they said.
   Savisaar was one of the founders this year of a group called the
Peoples Front, a citizens' organizations that says it supports
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms but demands more
autonomy for the Baltic republics.
   The article followed similar calls at a Communist Party
conference in Moscow at the end of June.
   Savisaar and Raig said the central government should count on
each of the 15 Soviet republics for production of goods and
services, but leave it to the republic to decide how best to
fulfill the task. They said the republics now have little power
over factories run by powerful Moscow ministries.
   Many Estonians are chafing under what they view as the drag on
their economies by other, less developed parts of the Soviet Union,
and some radicals are seeking a complete break.
   The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, named for Soviet Foreign
Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim Von
Ribbentrop, was published for the first time in the Soviet Union
less than two weeks ago by an Estonian newspaper.

<HEAD>Iran Reports Iraqi Troop Movements</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus AP) _ Iran claimed today that Iraq was massing
troops and moving armor to the warfront in preparation for new
military thrusts across the central and southern sectors of the
disputed border.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran sent an urgent message to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar notifying him of the
Iraqi movements and warning of ``the Iraqi regime's intentions to
launch military operations against Iran.''
   Iran and Iraq have accused each other of violating a cease-fire
that began Saturday.
   Velayati told Perez de Cuellar the Iraqis have massed troops
facing Fakkeh on the central sector of the border, IRNA reported.
The dispatch was monitored in Nicosia.
   The agency quoted Brig Gen. Asghar Jamali, deputy commander of
Iran's ground forces, as saying that U.N. observers watched an
Iraqi armored brigade roll up to the western bank of the Nahr Anbar
river at 11:07 a.m.
   He said the Iraqis dug in and were now facing the Iranians on
the other bank of the river in the southern sector of the warfront.
   IRNA quoted Jamali as saying that at the request of the command
of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, which is monitoring
the cease-fire, he ordered his troops not to fire or react in any
way to the Iraqi movements.
   There was no immediate comment from Baghdad on the Iranian
charges.
   Iraq claimed on Monday that the Iranians have redeployed in the
central sector of the border, and warned its troops may use force
to push them back.
   At the United Nations in New York, officials refused to discuss
the alleged cease-fire violations but said U.N. truce observers
were defusing tensions successfully on the front line.
   The two countries are scheduled to meet face-to-face in Geneva
Thursday for talks aimed at achieving a comprehensive peace in
their 8-year-old war.

<DATELINE>KOROR, Palau (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation of the shooting death of
President Lazarus Salii was stalled today pending the outcome of an
autopsy and an FBI examination of the weapon and other evidence.
   ``The government is still not ruling out anything,'' spokesman
Bonifacio Basilius said when asked if the autopsy had indicated the
shot was self-inflicted. ``Nothing has changed except an autopsy
took place.''
   Salii, 51, father of four children, was found alone Saturday in
a living room chair at his home with a single shot in the head from
a .357-caliber Magnum revolver.
   He was the second of Palau's three presidents in seven years to
die by gunfire. The first president of the tiny western Pacific
archipelago, Haruo I. Remeliik, was assassinated in June 1985.
   At a special election two months later, Salii was elected to
serve the remaining portion of Remeliik's four-year term. That term
would have ended this year; Salii had planned to announce his
candidacy for president Sunday.
   Basilius said the autopsy by Dr. Hee Yong Park, a pathologist
and chief medical examiner for Guam, and Dr. Victor Yano was
restricted to the head area.
   Basilius said the autopsy report is expected by Wednesday or
Thursday. He said it will be discussed with the Salii family and
``at that time a joint decision will be made as to when the content
is made public.''
   Basilius and Attorney General Philip Isaac said investigators
had thoroughly questioned Salii family members and neighbors. None
of them said they had seen anyone leave the Salii residence after a
noise was heard.
   Isaac said the revolver and spent bullet were found beside
Salii's chair. An FBI agent from Honolulu, who happened to be in
Palau on other business, left for Washington today with the
revolver, the spent bullet and hair samples for examination by the
agency's crime laboratory.
   Haruo Willter, Palau's liaison representative in Washington,
said today he had spent about two hours with Salii on Saturday,
reviewing his activities in Washington.
   ``We just talked about the things he already knew from our
nearly daily telephone conversations,'' said Willter, who arrived
Friday.
   He said Salii was in a ``very, very good mood and he invited me
to his rally on Sunday.''
   Salii's body was found by his wife, Tina, after she had finished
lunch with a maid and a driver.
   Vice President Thomas O. Remengasau, who also was Palau's
minister of justice, was sworn in late Saturday as the new
president.
   Two congressmen with ties to Palau expressed their sympathies to
the Salii family and Remengasau on Monday. Rep. Morris K. Udall,
D-Ariz., and Ron de Lugo, the non-voting representative in Congress
of the U.S. Virgin Islands, told Remengasau in a telegram: ``We
stand ready to help you and Palau's other leaders.''
   In April, Udall and de Lugo charged that Salii and two other
Palau officials were paid $475,000 in 1983 and 1984 out of a $32
million loan made by British banks to Palau for construction of a
power plant.
   Salii acknowledged receiving $100,000 from an official of the
company that built the plant, but said it went to a travel agency
he owned.
   Udall and de Lugo also have charged without elaboration that
several senior Palauan government officials have been connected to
shipments of Asian heroin through Palau.
   Udall is chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular
Affairs. De Lugo is chairman of the Subcommittee on Insular and
International Affairs, which is considering legislation to make the
island chain of 15,000 residents self-governing.
   A state funeral will be held Friday at the National Congress
Building in Koror, Palau's capital and business center, followed by
a funeral mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church.
   Janet McCoy, principal Interior Department deputy secretary,
will head a U.S. delegation to the funeral.

<HEAD>IRA Kills Royal Navy Recruiting Officer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with government changing plates
on cars of British military personnel in West Germany. Pick up 7th

<TEXT>
   The IRA killed a Royal Navy
officer with a bomb planted in his car that exploded near a Roman
Catholic section of Belfast. One newspaper said some residents
jeered as the car burned.
   The government said today it was changing the license plates on
British army cars in West Germany to disguise them against a
stepped-up IRA campaign.
   The killing Monday night came three days after eight British
soldiers were slain by another IRA bomb.
   Lt. Alan Shields, 45, a Royal Navy recruiting officer, was
driving into East Belfast when a bomb attached to his car blew up,
police said. They said Shields was the only casualty.
   The British newspaper The Guardian said some residents jeered as
the car burned.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a
telephoned message to a radio station, saying it had killed a
British soldier.
   Shields was believed to be the first member of the Royal Navy
killed by the IRA in Northern Ireland.
   The Defense Ministry, responding to a wave of attacks on British
military personnel in Western Europe this summer, said today the
distinctive military plates on the 95,000 cars driven by military
personnel and their families in West Germany would be replaced by
ordinary British plates.
   The change will make the plates indistinguishable from those on
cars of British tourists, Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton
said.
   Four soldiers have died in IRA attacks on British army personnel
in Western Europe this summer. It is suspected the IRA identified
them through plates on their cars.
   Crispin Rodwell, a news photographer who was driving about 50
yards behind the car, said: ``It just exploded and was immediately
engulfed in flames. Several people ran forward with fire
extinguishers but the flames were very intense.''
   ``They sprayed it but couldn't get close enough to have any
effect and the driver was still inside,'' Rodwell said.
   The attack followed an IRA bombing 50 miles west of Belfast on
Saturday that killed eight British soldiers in a military bus and
injured 27 others.
   In London, staff at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office
said she was ``saddened and angered by yet another senseless
killing.''
   Mrs. Thatcher ordered a major security review following the bomb
attack Saturday, the deadliest IRA attack on the military since
1982.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Monday that detention without trial of people
suspected of guerrilla activity had not been ruled out.
   Ken Maginnis, a Protestant member of Parliament from Northern
Ireland who urged Mrs. Thatcher to reinstate the policy, said he
gave her the names of three IRA men he claimed were involved in the
Saturday bombing.
   He claimed internment of 50-70 ``top flight'' IRA organizers
would ``drastically reduce'' violence in Northern Ireland.
   Internment was introduced in Northern Ireland in 1971 and about
2,000 people were held without trial before it was abandoned in
December 1975 amid world criticism.

   Michael Dukakis today said George Bush
``has no business'' in the White House if he supports mandatory
recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools.
   Dukakis also called his Republican opponent's plan to erase the
federal deficit ``son of voodoo economics.''
   Dukakis, beginning the second day of a gubernatorial trip to
northeastern Massachusetts, urged students to say the Pledge of
Allegiance at the start of the school day but said it would be
unconstitutional to make it mandatory.
   ``I say the Pledge of Allegiance. That's not the issue,''
Dukakis said.
   Bush and other Republicans have criticized Dukakis for vetoing a
state measure that would have penalized teachers if they did not
lead their students in the Pledge of Allegiance. Dukakis did so
after the state Supreme Court, citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent,
said the legislation was unconstitutional.
   ``You have no alternative but to veto it if you're true to your
oath,'' Dukakis told area newspapers editors. ``You're under a
constitutional oath to veto it. ... Is the vice president
suggesting something else? If he does, he has no business running
for the office.''
   The Democratic nominee also lambasted Bush's call for a flexible
freeze on federal spending as a means of balancing the budget.
   ``There is no Republican plan,'' Dukakis said after detailing
his plan to freeze military spending, reduce some domestic programs
and collect unpaid taxes. ``The vice president is talking about a
flexible freeze. That's like a melting ice cube. ... That's the son
of voodoo economics.''
   On Monday night, CIA Director William Webster briefed Dukakis
and running mate Lloyd Bentsen on national security and foreign
affairs.
   Participants refused to comment on the session, one of a series
of briefings Dukakis and Bentsen, already a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, are entitled to as the Democratic
presidential and vice presidential nominees.
   Dukakis, during a visit to Lowell on Monday, said his campaign
has been trying to complete arrangements for three debates with
Bush hosted by a bipartisan commission established under a joint
agreement between Republicans and Democrats.
   Dukakis said the Bush campaign has not responded to inquiries
about debates, but that he hoped the first encounter, scheduled by
the commission for Sept. 14, could be devoted to national security
and foreign policy.
   Bush frequently criticizes Dukakis as inexperienced on those
fronts, and did so again Monday in the context of U.S. involvement
in the Persian Gulf.
   Dukakis was quick to fire back.
   ``How anyone who sat there and did nothing while we sold arms to
the ayatollah can seriously talk about leadership in the Persian
Gulf is beyond me,'' Dukakis told a news conference.
   He also continued to question Bush's judgment in selecting Sen.
Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate and said voters should
compare the vice presidential nominees closely as they weigh their
vote for president.
   ``How we make decisions, how we make the presidential
selections, who we select ... whether or not that person should be
a heartbeat away from the presidency, obviously will be an issue in
this campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   Quayle has been embroiled in controversy since it was revealed
last week that an employee of his wealthy family's newspaper chain
who had ties to the Indiana National Guard recommended Quayle to
Guard officials at the height of the Vietnam War. By serving in the
Guard, Quayle, a staunch conservative, avoided combat duty.
Quayle's father also has been quoted as saying his son ``talked his
way'' into law school because his grades were not good enough.
   Dukakis said he considered the military records of candidates
for the presidency and vice presidency relevant as a campaign issue
but refused to answer directly when asked if he considered Quayle
qualified to be vice president.
   ``This is a judgment the American people will have to make,''
Dukakis said. ``They've had an opportunity now to watch Michael
Dukakis make his selection and George Bush make his decision. And
they will judge us on this and other issues.''
   Dukakis defended his military record from an attack by New York
Republican Rep. Gerald Solomon, who criticized Dukakis for
deferring his military service while attending Swarthmore College
during the Korean War.
   Dukakis said he could have applied for further deferments and
entered law school upon graduating Swarthmore in 1955 but instead
asked to be drafted immediately and entered the Army less than two
months after graduation.
   The truce ending the war had been signed by then, but Dukakis
served 16 months in Korea near the demilitarized zone.
   ``I'm very proud of that service and very proud of the
opportunity it gave me to serve my country,'' said Dukakis, who
suggested Solomon was trying to deflect attention from the Quayle
controversy.
   ``I don't think it's a coincidence that a Republican congressman
raised it,'' Dukakis said. ``It will be up to the Republican Party
to explain all this.''

<TEXT>
   The preaching children who frequently were
suspended from school last year for screaming Bible verses rather
enter class stayed home today while representatives of their
parents and the school held a meeting.
   Dan Rodden, president of the Chicago-based Caleb Campaign, a
nonprofit Christian civil rights organization which has agreed to
intercede on behalf of the Strode family, said the two sides were
trying to work out a solution.
   Duffey, Matthew and Pepper Strode's first day of school Monday
at Eastfield Elementary lasted less than a minute, and Duffey was
suspended again.
   At the school gate, Duffey, 11, and Matthew, 6, began to shout
Bible verses and Pepper, 7, yelled ``Repent.''
   ``We were there to welcome them to school,'' said Eastfield
Principal Jim Gorst. ``Duffey stuck his Bible in my face and he
said `You go to hell.'
   ``I have trouble when a child says that to an adult and an
authority figure.''
   All three children were suspended repeatedly last spring when
they stood behind the school screaming Bible verses and refused to
enter the building when asked. Their favorite verse is Hebrews
13:4: ``Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled. But
whoremongers and fornicators God will judge.''
   Parents of other Eastfield children are angry.
   ``I think it's going to get worse,'' said Linda Vaughn, whose
two children attend Eastfield. ``He ain't got no right to call our
kids whores and whoremongers. That little stupid brat. I ain't seen
no whores over here.''
   Rodden threatened legal action.
   The school system ``has basically violated these people's civil
rights,'' said Rodden said. ``Although their methods are offensive
to many people, I think the school system has overreacted.
   ``We have an attorney who is working on this case and we're
paying their legal fees,'' he said. ``We're not trying to bring a
lawsuit, although we will if we have to.''
   McDowell Schools Superintendent David Ricketts responded: ``I'm
ready. Let 'er rip. I've had it with this thing. It's getting on my
nerves.''
   Ricketts on Friday notified the children's parents, David and
Robin Strode, that they would be barred from the school grounds
Monday morning.
   So the Strodes brought Duffey, Matthew and Pepper to the school
gate where friends Barry and Dianna Weaver were to escort the
children to the front door.
   At the gate, Gorst told the Weavers they wouldn't be allowed on
the school grounds and that he and Ricketts would take the children
to class.
   A McDowell County sheriff's deputy approached. Duffey held
Matthew's hand and Pepper began to cry.
   Duffey says he turned to Gorst and said: ``You'll go to hell.''
   ``That's it,'' Ricketts said. ``You're suspended.''
   Gorst said Duffey told him: ``You go to hell.''
   Duffey was suspended for 10 days for disruptive and
disrespectful behavior, said Shirley Ramsey, the assistant
principal at Eastfield Elementary. She warned that a long-term
suspension that could last the entire school year ``can be enacted
at any point.''
   Ricketts said it was time to think about 11 other schools and
6,500 other students.
   ``It is absolutely degrading and demoralizing for a school
superintendent and his staff to be dealing so much with this when
we should be doing so many other things that are so much more
important to the general welfare of our students,'' he said.

   Academy Award-winning actress Helen
Hayes, who was hospitalized last weekend for an irregular
heartbeat, was released early today, hospital officials said.
   The 87-year-old actress flew out of Grand Junction at 6:30 a.m.
on her way home to Nyack, N.Y., they said.
   Her irregular heart beat was stabilized with medication in the
hospital, her son, actor James MacArthur, said Monday.
   Miss Hayes became ill Sunday while visiting MacArthur in Crested
Butte. She was flown 100 miles from the Rocky Mountain town to St.
Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction.
   ``I guess I am getting older,'' MacArthur quoted his mother as
saying.
   Doctors initially suspected the elevation was bothering Miss
Hayes. She had attended the Republican National Convention in New
Orleans last week and ``had gone from a lower elevation to a higher
elevation and her body wouldn't tolerate it,'' said nursing
supervisor Karen Bennett.
   Crested Butte is around 10,000 feet above sea level. Grand
Junction is 6,000 feet above.

   Singer-actress Grace Jones says Jamaican police
dragged her and two children from an American Airlines plane this
morning after her boyfriend demanded the pilot apologize for flight
delays. The airline denied the allegation.
   ``I went through hell and back,'' Ms. Jones said in a telephone
interview from Jamaica today.
   The argument escalated and police were called when the pilot,
who is white, allegedly used a racial slur to describe Ms. Jones'
boyfriend, who is black, said an officer at the Norman Manley
International Airport police station in Kingston, Jamaica.
   The officer, who refused to give his name, said the boyfriend,
Chris Stanley, 35, had demanded that pilot George Caughran
apologize for delays on the flight to New York.
   ``The captain didn't apologize for the late departure,'' he
said. Then, according to Stanley, ``the pilot called him a
nigger,'' the officer said. ``He didn't apologize for that either.''
   An American Airlines spokesman, Steve McGregor in Fort Worth,
Texas, said that was not true. ``Absolutely not. The pilot did not
use racial epithets. (Stanley) used racial epithets himself.''
   McGregor said when Ms. Jones' companion learned the flight was
delayed, he ``leaped over the ticket counter and threatened an
employee. He abused the flight attendants (verbally) and abused the
captain verbally.''
   Police were called, the Jamaican officer said, to remove Stanley
when he refused to get off the plane. Ms. Jones, her 8-year-old son
and Stanley's 8-year-old daughter also got off the plane and
accompanied Stanley to the police station, where he was charged
with disorderly behavior and resisting arrest, the officer said.
   Ms. Jones was not charged with anything, the officer said. ``She
said she couldn't go (on with the flight) alone,'' he said.
   But Ms. Jones, who was in Jamaica to record her next album, said
she and the children were forced off the plane.
   ``They physically pulled us off,'' she said.
   Ms. Jones said the plane was at least two hours late, but the
crew did not offer any apology.
   ``No one was making any disturbance whatsoever,'' she said, but
when Stanley asked the captain for an apology, he replied: ```We're
not going to apologize to niggers,' or something like that, with
the two children sitting behind us.''
   She said about 15 officers were called and they ``literally
pulled us, dragged us off the plane and pushed both of the
children.''
   ``Those children were totally molested. There's a plane full of
witnesses,'' Ms. Jones said.
   McGregor said American personnel at the scene described Ms.
Jones' demeanor as ``fairly calm throughout the whole incident.''
He said Ms. Jones never was removed from the flight. ``We asked her
if she wanted to continue on the flight,'' he said.
   Stanley was released on $200 bail, police said. He was to appear
before a resident magistrate today.

   A retired major general in the Indiana
National Guard said today he told subordinates to hold open a space
for Dan Quayle after a long-time friend called the general to
recommand Quayle as a ``good man'' for the Guard.
   Retired Major Gen. Alfred Ahner, who in 1969 was military
support plans officer for the state of Indiana and later headed the
state Guard, said he was contacted that spring by Wendell
Phillippi, an old friend and the managing editor of a newspaper
owned by Quayle's family.
   ``Wendell Phillippi had called and said he had a good man, and
said the thought he'd make a good Guardsman,'' Ahner said in a
telephone interview from Indiana. ``That's when I went over to
personnel. ...I asked if they had any spaces for a good man.
   ``They said they had a couple spaces. I said hold one of them,
there's a good guy coming over.''
   Asked about a report in today's editions of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer that said the Indiana Guard was at virtually full strength
when Quayle was accepted, Ahner said he did not know what numbers
the story, which quoted from the Guard's 1969 annual report,
referred to.
   Ahner said he had been assured by two Guard personnel people
that there were spaces. He said some units were filled but others
had openings.
   ``You could recruit to fill vacancies. ... We couldn't take him
if there wasn't any opening,'' Ahner said. He said Quayle was
accepted into the Guard's headquarters unit, which was ``pretty
selective.'' The unit looked for recruits with intelligence and
leadership potential.
   He also said it was not unusual for Guard officials to take such
recommendations because former Guard officials such as Phillippi,
who had been the Guard's commander, would have an eye for who might
make a good Guardsman. Ahner said Quayle received no preferential
treatment during his service.
   Quayle, in a hastily arranged speech Monday to the Veterans of
Foreign Wars convention in Chicago, said he had not used his
family's influence to get into the Guard during the Vietnam War.
   ``Influence was not even necessary if I had chosen to use it,
which I never would have,'' he said. ``The reason is because my
Indiana National Guard unit had openings before I applied, they had
openings when I applied, and they had openings after I applied. So
there was absolutely no influence used.''
   The Plain Dealer, however, said today that the annual report
shows the Guard had imposed severe restrictions on recruitment 49
days before Quayle's enlistment on May 19, 1969.
   The newspaper said the report said that ``due to some
overstrength, recruiting has been authorized on a limited basis
since 1 April.''
   In addition, the newspaper said in a copyrighted story that by
June the state guard had 52 more members than were authorized by
law.
   The newspaper said the report had been signed by Guard Brig.
Gen. John H. Owens.
   Asked for comment by the newspaper, Owens said:
   ``I don't know anything about that. I went back to the official
report in Washington, which showed 136 (authorized) spaces in his
(Quayle's) unit in April, May and June, and they never had over 132
people.''
   Monday night, Quayle's campaign aides gave out an Aug. 19
statement released by the Indiana National Guard, saying Quayle's
unit ``had vacancies the month before, the month of and the month
after the senator's enlistment.''
   Quayle's speech won praise from many veterans.
   ``Quayle showed a lot of backbone by coming here tonight,'' said
Tom Gerlach, 38, a Vietnam combat veteran from Dayton, Ohio. ``He
made a strong impression. I think he probably picked up a lot of
support.''
   ``I think in a way (Quayle's military service) is kind of blown
out of proportion,'' said Billy Stansberry of Joplin, Mo., who also
served in Vietnam. ``If the man's qualified, that's all that
matters to me.''
   The crowd cheered when the Indiana senator opened his brief
remarks by joking, ``My national guard unit was never called up to
active duty, but let me say that after these last 72 hours no one
can say I've never faced combat.''
   Quayle, a pro-military conservative on Capitol Hill, told the
veterans he hoped his remarks would end the controversy over
whether he pulled strings to enter the National Guard in 1969 as
his college draft deferment was about to end.
   ``The question before all of us is: Not what Dan Quayle did 20
years in the past _ but what either President Bush or President
Dukakis will do in the future to secure world peace,'' Quayle said.
   Wade LaDue, the VFW's spokesman, said the VFW had never formally
scheduled Quayle to speak at the convention, but that the nominee
was invited when Republican Illinois Gov. James Thompson intervened
with organization Commander in Chief Earl Stock after Bush's warm
reception Monday morning.
   The vice presidential nominee was scheduled to return to the
campaign trail Wednesday, certain to face more questions about his
past.
   Paula Parkinson was linked again to Quayle in a report published
today in the Daily News of Los Angeles. Two former attorneys for
Ms. Paula Parkinson said she told the FBI in 1981 that Quayle
propositioned her during a Florida trip but she refused him. The
attorneys said Ms. Parkinson told the FBI the request was made when
Quayle and two other legislators shared a cottage with her during
the 1980 golfing trip, according to the Daily News.
   Quayle, an Indiana senator who has been married since 1972, has
said he did not have an affair with Ms. Parkinson, and a campaign
spokesman declined comment Monday evening about the lawyers'
allegations.
   The two lawyers represented Ms. Parkinson when she was
questioned on March 28, 1981, by the FBI during an investigation of
whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation.
   Meanwhile, The Des Moines Register, an influential newspaper in
the farm belt, called today for Bush to replace Quayle, who the
paper said would remain ``a distraction from the issues throughout
the campaign.''
   ``It's tough to admit a mistake, but a willingness to see an
error and to rectify it is a far better quality in a would-be
president than a refusal to do so,'' the newspaper said in an
editorial.

   A cold front pulled much cooler air into the northern Plains
today, giving a part of America a break from summer's record heat
for the second time in less than a week.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued ahead of the front, with the
heaviest storms widespread from the middle Mississippi Valley to
the southern Plains.
   The thunderstorms brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the
region. Winds gusted to near 45 mph Monday night in parts of St.
Louis and to near 50 mph in Greene County, Ill., north of St.
Louis, causing power outages.
   Springfield, Mo., got 3.35 inches of rain this morning.
   Thunderstorms trailing the front across the Texas Panhandle and
central New Mexico also brought brief, heavy rain. A half inch fell
at Amarillo, Texas, in 30 minutes this morning.
   Thunderstorms moved from eastern North Dakota to central and
eastern Minnesota Monday night and today.
   Showers and thunderstorms also continued today from northern
Alabama to southeast Georgia and northeast Florida.
   The first cold front brought more seasonable temperatures to the
Northeast, the Ohio Valley and the Middle Atlantic States before
the weekend.
   That cool air remained in place in the Northeast, where
temperatures dipped to record lows today, including 44 at Albany,
N.Y.; 43 at Burlington, Vt.; and 42 at Hartford, Conn., while
Syracuse, N.Y., tied its record of 45. In the distant Northwest,
Pocatello, Idaho, tied its record low of 36.
   The fronts are easing the swelter of a summer in which more than
2,000 records have fallen.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Great Lakes region to the Ohio and middle Mississippi
valleys, and from Oklahoma and the southern Rockies to the Arizona
mountains, with storms most numerour from southeast Michigan to the
lower Ohio Valley, southern Missouri and the Arizona mountains; and
from the Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys to the Gulf Coast
states, Georgia and Florida.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s and 90s across much
of the nation; the 60s and 70s from the north Atlantic Coast to the
Great Lakes, North Dakota and the California coast; 100 to 105
degrees in the Rio Grande Valley and the central part of Texas,
inland western Oregon, the central valleys of California and the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Houlton, Maine, to 89 at Nellis Air Force Base near Las
Vegas, Nev.

   People living near a pharmaceutical
laboratory that burned down were allowed to return to their homes
today as officials continued investigating whether smoke from the
fire was toxic.
   Clouds of smoke hovering over Rexburg and nearby Sugar City from
Monday's fire were dispersing and drifting away from populated
areas, said Gordon Harrop of the Rexburg-Madison County Fire
Department.
   An explosion Monday afternoon apparently started the fire in the
Ferguson Pharmaceuticals laboratory, a research and development
facility where diet supplements were developed for the company's
2,300 Diet Center franchises in the United States and Canada.
   The plant's 120 employees were on a break; no one was injured in
the explosion or fire. But people were evacuated overnight from a
four-block area around the plant, a Madison County sheriff's office
said.
   Four people were treated for respiratory complaints at Madison
Memorial Hospital and released.
   Ross Mayfield, operations director for the state Bureau of
Disaster Services, said residents' breathing problems may have been
caused by chlorine and polyvinyl chloride fumes from burning
plastic containers.
   The bureau asked the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near
Arco to help monitor the cloud for hazardous chemicals.
   Harrop said the fire was allowed to burn itself out when it was
clear that the building and its contents could not be saved. Crews
monitored the gutted, smoldering building today, and a state fire
investigator was on the scene, he said.

   The captain of the USS Dubuque has been
charged with two counts of violating lawful orders for failing to
rescue a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who claim they later
resorted to cannibalism to survive.
   Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48, flew to San Diego, Calif., on
Sunday after being notified of the charges and is scheduled to
appear Wednesday at a hearing, Cmdr. David Dillon, a Pacific Fleet
spokesman, said today.
   Balian has been assigned a Navy lawyer and is currently

commander of all surface ships in the U.S. Pacific Fleet, at a
so-called ``admiral's mast'', the spokesman said.
   Dillon said the captain had been charged under procedures within
the Uniform Code of Military Justice for ``non-judicial
punishment,'' meaning he is not facing a court-martial.
   Davis will serve as the lone judge or authority in considering
the evidence. He could take a variety of disciplinary actions,
including stripping Balian of his command permanently, ordering a
fine or issuing a letter of reprimand or censure.
   Balian was temporarily relieved of his command of the Dubuque
earlier this month while on patrol in the Persian Gulf pending the
outcome of a Navy investigation.
   Balian has been charged specifically with two counts of
violating Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for
failing to heed a lawful order, Dillon said.
   ``One charge involves a Navy regulation and the other involves
fleet operations orders,'' the spokesman said. ``But both the
regulation and orders have to do with rendering assistance to
people adrift on the sea.''
   The first charge alleges that Balian ``did fail to obey a lawful
general regulation ... by wrongfully failing to render appropriate
assistance to Vietnamese refugees found on the South China Sea on
June 9, 1988, in danger of being lost.''
   The second charge alleges that he was derelict in his duty by
``negligently (failing) to investigate sufficiently and render
appropriate assistance to Vietnamese refugees found on the South
China Sea on June 9, 1988, as it was his duty to do.''
   The Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship, encountered a boatload
of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea while en route to the
Persian Gulf. According to the Navy, the Dubuque provided the
refugees several hundred pounds of food and water and navigational
aids but did not take them aboard.
   The boat people were eventually rescued off the coast of the
Philippines and taken to a refugee camp there, where reports of
killing and cannibalism began to surface.
   Both the Navy and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees
have been investigating those reports.
   Some survivors have been quoted as saying they killed and ate
some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they
encountered the Dubuque on June 9. Two of the victims reportedly
died of starvation, but three others allegedly were killed through
drowning and then eaten.
   Some survivors said the Dubuque refused to take them aboard even
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and
starvation.
   According to Robert Cooper, the Manila representative of the
U.N. refugee commission, 52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 58
people died during the crossing. The refugees began their journey
on May 22 from the Mekong Delta town of Ben Tre aboard a 35-foot
wooden boat. Its engine failed two or three days later.
   Navy regulations specify that warships may pick up refugees on
the high seas if the vessel they're traveling in is judged
unseaworthy, bad weather is approaching or there are ``other
special circumstances.''
   ``In other words, it's a judgment call by the captain of the
vessel,'' Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard has said.

   Dying winds and 1,200 soldiers flown in to bolster weary
firefighters in Yellowstone National Park have helped slow the
blaze that was threatening two Montana towns at the park's
northeast end.
   ``The threat to Cooke City and Silver Gate is essentially
over,'' Fire Operations Chief Steve Frye said today.
   ``With the break in the winds the last two days, firefighters
have had an opportunity to make some significant headway'' against
the Yellowstone fires that have blackened at least 350,000 acres in
Wyoming and Montana, Frye said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Although winds of up to 70 mph over the weekend have died down,
Frye said the burning acreage in the northeast Clover-Mist section
of the park had increased to 215,00 acres, a jump over the 157,000
acres reported burning over the weekend.
   In Idaho, National Guardsmen were called out to help attack a
700-acre fire.
   Cooler temperatures and relatively light winds Monday helped
firefighters battle the 37,000-acre Warm Springs Creek forest fire,
southeast of Helena, Mont.
   The 2-week-old fire, which damaged 13 homes and threatened
scores of others, was the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's No. 1
priority Monday, said Jack Wilson, the agency's top official at the
Inter-Agency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, which coordinates
firefighting resources nationwide.
   The blaze in the rugged Elkhorn Mountains was burning in only a
few spots inside the fire lines Monday evening. Crews had hoped to
contain it by tonight, but after viewing the fire this morning they
pushed that deadline back to Wednesday night, said fire information
officer Bob Krepps. A fire is contained when it is surrounded by a
fire line.
   Some of the 2,900 firefighters still might be sent home today,
he said, while those remaining would finish establishing the fire
line and dousing hot spots that could flare if winds kicked up.
   The infantrymen at Yellowstone, who arrived Monday from Fort
Lewis, Wash., would work to keep the fires from spreading into
commercial areas of the Shoshone National Forest and into Montana's
Custer National Forest, said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   ``At this point, having fresh help and able-bodied help is very
important,'' she said.
   ``Things are generally quiet, which is a good sign,'' she said.
``But the forecast is calling for warmer temperatures, drier
conditions and a potential for higher winds.''
   Despite help from the weather, Yellowstone's south entrance
remained closed Monday, forcing visitors to travel about 150 miles
to the west entrance. Three other entrances also remained open,
officials said.
   Several spots near the southern entrance were closed, including
the Grant Village area, which contains a hotel, campground, visitor
center and park staff facilities; and the Norris, Madison and Lewis
Lake campgrounds.
   The Pebble Creek campground, on the northern edge, also was
closed.
   In western Yellowstone, flames from the 91,700-acre North Fork
fire destroyed 10 power lines on Sunday, and crews spent Monday
wrapping power lines with protective material, removing excess
fuels and hosing down buildings around Norris.
   In southeast Montana, flame retardant was dropped by air to keep
a fire in Kirby from burning a ranch home 6 miles south of Birney,
said Don Kendall of the Department of State Lands.
   Crews hoped to contain the 12,000-acre range and timber fire
today and were working Monday night to put out hot spots, Kendall
said.
   Meanwhile, officials at Yellowstone National Park said fires
there posed no immediate threat to residents of Cooke City and
Silver Gate.
   The two southern Montana towns are on the northeast border of
the park and just south of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness.
   But as a precaution, some crews were clearing out fuels from
around the towns, officials said.
   In Idaho, Gov. Cecil Andrus authorized on Monday use of two
dozen National Guard members to help control a 700-acre Eagle Bar
fire near Hells Canyon Dam, north of Boise.
   The guardsmen were dispatched Monday to provide transportation
and other support for crews working to stop the fire in
west-central Idaho's Payette National Forest.
   The fire started late Saturday in tinder-dry grass near the
Snake River, 1{ miles south of Hells Canyon Dam. Officials said the
flames quickly spread to steep, rugged terrain.

   A man who won $386,563 in a lottery two
years ago has been jailed in lieu of $1,000 bond on a charge of
issuing a worthless check.
   Charles Brownlee, 37, of Kenosha purchased $839.99 in
merchandise with a check April 28 that was returned stamped
``account closed,'' Racine police said. Officers said the debt to
Sears, Roebuck and Co. had not been paid.
   Brownlee, who entered the Racine County Jail on Monday, was
accused in 1985 of trying to entice a 14-year-old youth into his
car. He was convicted in 1986 of attempted false imprisonment in
the case.
   He was jailed in lieu of bond from November 1985 until early
April 1986, when he learned that an Illinois State Lottery ticket
at his home entitled him to the $386,563.
   According to court records, Brownlee spent $103,000 of the
lottery winnings to buy two vehicles for a limousine service,
donated $80,000 to charity and spent between $10,000 and $15,000 to
host a party in Kenosha.

<HEAD>Administration Accused of Using `Excuse' To Break ABM Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the private Arms Control
Association accused the Reagan administration on Tuesday of using a
disputed Soviet radar facility in Siberia as an excuse to undercut
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The accord restricts U.S. and Soviet anti-missile defenses. A
review of compliance with the treaty, held every five years, opens
on Wedneday in Geneva.
   President Reagan has authorized American negotiators to accuse
the Soviets of causing a ``material breach'' of the pact with the
radar facility at Krasnoyarsk. If the negotiationrs level the
charge the United States would have the right to break out of the
treaty.
   Spurgeon Keeny, who heads the Arms Control Association, agreed
with the administration that the facility is in violation of the
treaty. But, he said, ``a material breach can only be claimed by a
country seeking an excuse to suspend or terminate the ABM treaty.''
   Keeny, a former deputy director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said ``it may set in motion a series of events
that could have a very serious impact.''
   The treaty restricts U.S. and Soviet defenses on the theory the
likelihood of sustaining devastating nuclear retaliation would
inhibit a potential aggressor from launching a nuclear attack.
   Reagan in two reports to Congress has charged that Krasnoyarsk
violates the treaty.
   The Soviets claim the facility is part of a legal system of
tracking space vehicles. U.S. officials contend Krasnoyarsk is
intended to be part of a ``battle management'' strategy.
   Keeny said the Soviets had taken some ``forthcoming'' steps
since U.S. intelligence identified Krasnoyarsk in 1983. A
Congressional delegation was permitted to make an inspection, and
construction at Krasnoyarsk was discontinued last fall.
   The Soviets also have said they would dismantle the facility if
the United States agreed to adhere to the treaty.
   Critics of the Reagan administration suspect the treaty may be
abandoned in order to clear the way for more extensive testing of
the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, known popularly as ``Star
Wars.''
   The program seeks to develop a space-based shield against Soviet
nuclear attack. It is based on the view that the theory behind the
ABM treaty is outdated and that the Soviets are developing their
own anti-missile defenses anyway.
   Keeny said Krasnoyark does not represent a threat to U.S.
national security, but that the White House was taking ``a very
confrontational approach'' to the Soviets on the subject.
   Ralph Earle, a former director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, urged the Reagan administration to apply the
``rule of reason'' to the dispute.
   He said Krasnoyarsk does not undermine the treaty as a whole,
and that the Soviets are seeking a ``face-saving'' solution.
   Earle said Krasnoyarsk was designed to provide `'early warning''
of a nuclear attack _ which is legal __ but it is not located on
the periphery of Soviet territory, as the treaty requires.
   Keeny and Earle spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Arms
Control Association and the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, another private research group.

   A former U.S. Olympic boxer was among
three men arrested in the kidnapping of a banker who escaped by
untying himself from a tree, authorities said today.
   Clint Jackson, who lost in the preliminaries of the 1976
Olympics in Montreal, was charged with first-degree kidnapping in
the abduction of Thomas Salo, vice president of the First Alabama
Bank of Evergreen, said Conecuh County Sheriff Edwin L. Booker.
   Jackson was arrested in the Atlanta area Monday night, said
Booker. Sheriff's Lt. David Wood of Clayton County, Ga., said
Jackson was charged as a fugitive under state law.
   Jackson, 34, formerly lived in Evergreen in south Alabama and
knows Salo, said Booker. He worked for several years as a jailer
with the Davidson County Sheriff's Department in Nashville, Tenn.,
and compiled a 25-5 record while fighting professionally from 1979
through October 1985.
   A secretary said Jackson left the sheriff's department on Jan.
15, 1981, and has not been heard from since.
   David Reginald Smith, 24, of Atlanta and Billie Jean Jackson,
27, of Evergreen also were charged with kidnapping and were held in
the Conecuh County Jail, said Booker. It wasn't clear if the two
Jackson men were related. The sheriff said federal charges might be
filed.
   Conecuh County authorities planned to travel to Atlanta to
question Clint Jackson, said the sheriff.
   Salo was confronted at gunpoint by two masked men on his way to
work Monday. The men told Salo to write a check for $9,000 and to
call the bank to tell workers to cash it, said Booker.
   After getting the check, the two took Salo to a wooded area,
where a car driven by a third man was waiting, said the sheriff.
The men tied Salo to a tree and left him, unharmed.
   Salo managed to free himself and telephone the sheriff's office.
Booker said he was waiting at the bank when Smith came inside to
cash the check using a bogus identification card.
   Billie Jean Jackson was arrested shortly afterward.

<TEXT>
   A man arrested with his teen-age
girlfriend after a nationally televised show linked them to a
robbery and slaying has been convicted of the killing.
   Jerry Strickland, 26, was found guilty Monday of the May 11,
1987, robbery, kidnap and murder of a gasoline company money
courier, said Dan Wangler, a clerk for Circuit Judge James Thorburn.
   Elmer DeBoer, 38, was shot twice in the head after being robbed
of $11,000 at the gas station where he had gone to pick up
receipts, police said. Melissa Munday, 18, Strickland's girlfriend
and mother of two of his children, worked at the station.
   Strickland and Munday left Michigan after DeBoer's slaying and
wound up in Moses Lake, Wash. They surrendered in February after
they happened to see NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' broadcast on
DeBoer's death and the pair's disappearance. Police in Moses Lake
also received 15 to 20 calls from other viewers of the show who
thought they recognized the couple.
   ``I can't say I'm glad it's over, because it will never be over
for me,'' a weeping Mary DeBoer, the victim's widow, said outside
the courtroom after the verdict.
   The murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment without parole; sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 9.
   Prosecutors dropped murder and kidnapping charges against Munday
in exchange for her testimony against Strickland. She still faces
armed robbery charges in juvenile court.
   She testified last week that she participated in the robbery but
didn't know about DeBoer's death until Strickland confessed to her
two months later.

   Power was cut to several downtown blocks for about
two hours today when a crew searching for an underground gas leak
started an electrical fire, forcing evacuations of at least one
office tower and stalling commuters.
   A Boston Edison Co. spokesman said 12,500 residential and
commercial customers were affected. Scores of commuters on one
subway line had to be escorted through a darkened tunnel when their
trains stopped; intersections were snarled when traffic lights went
blank.
   Power was restored to all but about 23 buildings along
fashionable Newbury Street, near the spot where the fire broke out.
They were expected to be without power ``for much of the daylight
time,'' said Edison spokesman Walter Salvi.
   ``At least I wasn't in the elevator,'' said Mary Kercz, one of
about 100 people evacuated from the Boston Public Library.
   There were reports that several people were briefly trapped in
elevators at the nearby 52-story Prudential office tower.
   Another Edison spokesman, Dan Delurey, said the power was cut to
fight the manhole fire, reportedly set off by a repair crew that
cut Edison cables while digging for a gas leak.
   The affected area included parts of the city's central shopping
areas and several major hotels. The Massachusetts Turnpike tunnel
under downtown Copley Square went dark, forcing drivers to switch
on their headlights and slow down when entering.
   The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority used buses to
ferry passengers among the three affected subway stations.
   A foam-spraying truck from Logan International Airport was
called to the fire, which took abouut 35 minutes to extinguish.
   At the Neiman-Marcus specialty store in the posh Copley Place
shopping mall, a back-up generator and a skylight kept the store
bright. But, without power, the cash registers were still.
   The blackout cut power to the Westin Hotel at Copley Place, but
emergency generators kept lights on in public areas and sent all
elevators to the ground floor, said hotel spokeswoman Susan Mooncai.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of homicides in Houston this year is
up by more than 40 percent, with more drug-related killings
reported during the first eight months of 1988 than in all of 1987,
police records show.
   As of Sunday, 300 homicides had occurred in Houston, compared
with 209 through Aug. 21, 1987. Sixty-nine slayings this year are
believed to have been drug-related, 19 more than in 1987, records
show.
   Police speculated that drug killings are increasing because of
the popularity of crack cocaine and an influx of Colombian and
Jamaican drug dealers, who are believed to be more violent than the
typical local street dealer.
   ``Evidently the competition is getting stiffer,'' said Sgt. John
Burmester. ``There's big money involved and people will kill each
other for little money.''
   The FBI's uniform crime report for 1987 said Houston had a rate
of 13.8 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, below New York's 20.4,
Detroit's 20.2, Miami's 20.1, Los Angeles' 16.6 and New Orleans'
18.1, but above Dallas' 2.9, Pittsburgh's 3.1 and Boston's 4.0.

<HEAD>Shakespeare's `King John,' Starring Kevin Conway, Opens in Central
Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``King John'' is one of Shakespeare's least
performed historical plays, and the situation won't change after
the revival of the drama in Central Park by the New York
Shakespeare Festival.
   The play is a pageantry about greed, but not much of its
celebration of self-interest, or anything else for that matter,
comes across in the Public Theater's sprawling and haphazard
production.
   That's because director Stuart Vaughan lets his actors do what
they want, resulting in a clash of acting styles that leaves more
blood on the stage than any of fight co-ordinator B.H. Barry's
awkwardly choreographed battles.
   John is not the most forceful of Shakespeare's monarchs. In this
production, Kevin Conway plays him as a petulant, difficult child,
but it's still a performance with little personality. Despite a few
minor tantrums, Conway practically disappears into the dour, gray
scenery by Lindsay W. Davis. His death at the end of the play seems
little more than an aside to all the fight scenes that have gone
before.
   Jay O. Sanders is more forceful as Philip, supposedly the
illegitimate son of Richard the Lion-Hearted. Philip is the one
fictional character in the play and dominates the evening. He's a
kind of master of ceremonies, a not-disinterested everyman who
comments on and participates in the action. Sanders plays him a
little too comically, and an ill-fitting wig that makes him look
like a red-haired Prince Valiant doesn't help his performance.
   The production's best acting comes from Devon Michaels as the
young Arthur, John's nephew and the rightful heir to the throne.
He's direct and straightforward in his interpretation of the little
prince and even manages to get some of the poetry Shakespeare put
in the play.
   Mariette Hartley, late of the early morning television wars,
struggles with the role of Constance, Arthur's vengeful mother. She
has about as much success as she did on CBS, trying to wrestle
audiences away from ``Today'' and ``Good Morning, America.''
   ``King John'' is the fifth production in the New York
Shakespeare Festival's marathon of all the Bard's plays. So far,
the festival has had better luck with its exuberant renditions of
two comedies _ ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ``Much Ado About
Nothing.'' The tragedies and historical dramas like ``King John''
have defeated the festival's efforts.
   In other reviews, Clive Barnes in the New York Post said, ``It
has clarity and purpose, a handful of performances worth
cherishing, a few lively sword-fights, and an interestingly
uncluttered view of Shakespeare's England through his slanted
perspective of English history.''
   Howard Kissel wrote in the Daily News: ``The production,
visually dull, is not likely to win new friends for `King John,'
but it presents the play with clarity and occasionally force.''
   Frank Rich, in The New York Times, wrote, ``Though `King John'
is far better acted than the deadly all-star `Julius Caesar' that
Mr. Vaughan fielded in the spring, it is staged in the same way:
colorless standard-issue sets and costumes, attenuated and cliched
battle sequences, a stiff front-and-center procession of scene
after scene. The play is dispensed like medicine.''
   Linda Winer wrote in Newsday that the production ``is ultimately
a provocative staging of one of Shakespeare's least familiar
history plays. Since this `John' has been directed by Stuart
Vaughan, who recently bashed `Julius Caesar' stupid with Martin
Sheen and Al Pacino, and since it costars Mariette Hartley, most
renowned from Polaroid commercials and the last failed CBS `Morning
SHow,' this accomplishment is even more of a pleasant surprise.''

   A 6-foot tiger shark in a restaurant fish
tank attacked a diver who had climbed in to feed other fish.
   Wiley Beevers needed 75 stitches to close the bite on his arm,
said Jack Dunn, one of the owners of Sharky's Reef Restaurant in
suburban New Orleans.
   The attack happened Friday as about 50 people were dining, Dunn
said Monday.
   ``They got to see something a lot of people hope they'll never
get to see,'' said Dunn said. ``They were concerned for the diver,
and were relieved to see he was OK.''
   Beevers left the aquarium on his own and was taken to East
Jefferson Hospital, Dunn said. He was released a few hours later.
   Dunn said divers routinely go into the 135,000-gallon aquarium
to feed fish. The shark had never before bothered a diver, he said.

<TEXT>
   The foot may be connected to the ankle,
but the ankle is not the podiatrist's domain, a court has ruled.
   The podiatrists had urged the high court to accept a 1984 ruling
by the Board of Examiners in Podiatry that ``the ankle is part of
the foot and the foot is part of the ankle'' and, therefore,
podiatrists could treat ankle ailments.
   But state Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling barring
podiatrists from treating ankle ailments.
   The high court, ruling in the podiatrists' appeal of a ruling
won by the Connecticut State Medical Society, said the Superior
Court had correctly ``relied on common usage and the dictionary
definition of `foot.'''
   ``Had the Legislature intended to include the ankle in the
definition of `foot,' it could easily have done so,'' wrote Supreme
Court Justice T. Clark Hull in the unanimous opinion.

   A half-ton pair of tires jettisoned by a
truck tore into a house, dragged a water bed across a floor, broke
through a wall and ripped a door from a teen-ager's hand before
imbedding in another wall.
   The tractor-trailer driver didn't know what happened until he
was chased down by motorcyclist Tim Rice, whom the flying tires
narrowly missed Monday.
   The truck was rolling down Interstate 94 when the the tires flew
off, nearly hitting Rice on a service drive.
   Earl Carter, owner of the house, said the tires crashed through
a bedroom window, pulled the bed across the room, tore through a
bedroom wall, ripped a bathroom door out of his son's hand and
landed in the opposite wall.
   ``My boy was just getting ready to go into the bathroom, had
just opened the door, and the tire took half the door with it,''
Carter said.
   No one was injured.
   State trooper Gary Gray said the single-story frame house was
rocked from its foundation and the ceilings were destroyed.
   Truck driver Francis Meldrum of Mount Clemens returned to the
house. ``He was all upset, and very honest,'' Gray said.
   The trucker probably will not be ticketed because maintenance of
the truck is the responsibility of the owner, TRW Automotive
Product Parts in Washington, north of Pontiac. No charges have been
filed against the company.

   A homeless man apparently bled to death early
Tuesday after he slashed his arms trying to scale a fence rimmed
with razor wire, the Transit Authority reported.
   The man was found in the TA's material storage yard in Brooklyn,
according to TA spokesman Albert O'Leary. The man, in his late 30s,
had been dead for several hours.
   O'Leary said he had no knowledge of how the man got into the
rail yard, which is encircled by a double set of chain-link fences
each topped with razor wire.
   ``Apparently the man had been inside the yard and tried to get
out by climbing over the fence,'' O'Leary said. ``He cut both of
his arms and his wrists on the top of the fence. He then climbed or
fell off the fence and walked a couple of hundred feet where he sat
down by a pile of railroad ties and apparently bled to death.''
   The man carried no identifying papers and was apparently
homeless, O'Leary said.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said today he will
probably delay the execution this week of a convicted killer who
has maintained his innocence for more than a decade.
   The state Pardon Board recommended Monday night that Ronald
Monroe's sentence for the 1977 stabbing death of Lenora Collins be
reduced to life imprisonment.
   Roemer said during a news conference today that Monroe's case
``has been giving me personal concern for some time.''
   Monroe, 33, is scheduled to die in the electric chair early
Thursday.
   Although Roemer said he was leaning against a commutation, he
said he probably would stay the execution for up to 100 days to
allow courts to review the case. Roemer said he would issue a
decision later in the day.
   Louisiana's three governors since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty in 1976 have refused to intervene in
pending executions.
   In a brief statement, Pardon Board chairman Yvonne Campbell said
the panel found that Monroe had been deprived of due process of
law. She would not elaborate or disclose how board members voted.
   Monroe, maintaining that he had not killed Lenora Collins,
pleaded for clemency during a hearing at the Louisiana State
Penitentiary here Monday.
   ``I am innocent and will be innocent until the day I die,'' he
said.
   Prosecutors contend Collins was killed after she told Monroe he
was being evicted from an apartment in the family's duplex.
   Defense attorney Douglas Morris said a confession to Collins'
slaying by another man raised enough questions to justify a life
sentence.
   ``I think that anyone who studies the facts of this case will
realize there is a grave doubt about who committed this crime,''
Morris said.
   He said Monroe has an IQ of 77, and reads no better than a
third-grader.
   Courts have rejected the defense contention that George Stinson,
convicted in the 1980 stabbing death of his common-law wife in
Pontiac, Mich., told a cellmate, Francis Lee McWilliams, that he
killed Collins.
   McWilliams told police that Stinson said only that Collins had
been killed in the same way as his wife, according to testimony.
   Family members, including Monroe's wife, Jo Ann, and his
daughter, told the board that Monroe was quiet and introverted and
had no previous record of violence.
   The chief witnesses against Monroe in his 1980 trial were
Collins' two children, who were 11 and 12 years old when she was
slain in 1977. The daughter, Theodise, was stabbed in the back when
she tried to help her mother.
   On Monday, Theodise Collins again identified Monroe as the
killer.
   Monroe said he was sleeping in his apartment at the time of the
killing.
   The case has been through the courts several times. The U.S.
Supreme Court has rejected appeals twice. A third request to block
the execution was filed last week.
   Eighteen people have died in Louisiana's electric chair since
1976, three of them this year.

<TEXT>
   The parents of a rape victim staked out
the location of the attack for more than a year, with the wife as
decoy and her armed husband waiting in the dark. Their persistence
paid off with the arrest of a man police say is responsible for as
many as 60 rapes.
   ``Obviously, they had really carefully thought out what they
were going to do,'' Debra Seltzer, rape prevention coordinator of
the local chapter of Women Against Rape, said Tuesday. ``It really
shows the frustration that a lot of people feel.''
   Police on Monday announced the arrest of Robert Biddings, 34, of
Columbus, who authorities say is a suspect in a four-year string of
attacks attributed to the so-called ``handcuff rapist.'' The
nickname resulted from the use of handcuffs in early attacks later
attributed to the same man.
   Biddings was being held on one count of rape and two counts of
kidnapping in lieu of bonds totaling $750,000. But police said they
would seek to have him charged with as many as five dozen rapes.
   ``We're talking about 60 rapes and over 100 felony charges
altogether,'' said Capt. Antone Lanata.
   In announcing the arrest, police said only that they were led to
Biddings by the victim of an attempted rape who was able to give
police a license number of a car driven by her alleged assailant.
Police said they traced the car to Biddings and arrested him
Thursday.
   However, a court document shows the victim cited was a woman
whose daughter had been raped in the same spot in June 1987. The
woman was acting as a decoy to apprehend her daughter's attacker,
according to a search warrant affidavit police filed with the
Franklin County Municipal Court.
   The affidavit said the older woman was standing at a bus stop on
the city's near east side about 10:30 p.m. Aug. 5 when she was
approached by a man, grabbed from behind, carried to a nearby yard
and thrown to the ground.
   ``The suspect then produced a small, black revolver, pointed the
firearm at (the woman) and stated, `I blow your head off,''' the
affidavit says.
   The woman's husband, who had been watching from a car, then ran
up behind the man and said ``Freeze! Police!'' according to the
affidavit. The attacker fled, but the husband obtained the license
number of the man's vehicle, according to the court document.
   Police said the couple identified Biddings' photo from a group
of 11 photos. Later, their 23-year-old daughter picked Biddings'
photo from a similar group.
   The Columbus Dispatch reported in a copyright story Tuesday that
the parents had spent several nights a week for the last year in
search of their daughter's attacker, despite warnings from police
that they were placing their lives in danger and probably wasting
their time.
   The father said he knew police were understaffed and could not
spend as much time on the case as he and his wife wanted. The
Dispatch interviewed the father Monday, but efforts to reach him
Tuesday were unsuccessful. There is no listing for the couple in
the Columbus telephone directory, and the affidavit did not
identify the couple's hometown.
   Lanata refused to confirm the newspaper's account.
   ``I didn't give it to them, and I don't intend to comment on
their story,'' he said.
   Deborah Emm, author of a doctoral dissertation on survivors of
sexual assaults, said the parents' eagerness to see their
daughter's attacker brought to justice was not unusual. But their
persistence was.
   ``I certainly couldn't endorse it,'' said Ms. Emm, who is
director of Survivors of Crime, a local hospital-affiliated
organization that helps victims and their families deal with
assaults. But, she said, ``It's certainly understandable why people
would do this.''
   ``Usually, people try to do that shortly after the assault
occurs, and they're usually not successful,'' she said. ``People
who are close to a victim feel victimized themselves. Sometimes
they feel more a victim than the one who was assaulted.''

<HEAD>School Costs: $4,810 Per Pupil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educating America's youth is expected to cost
$4,810 per student in public elementary and secondary schools this
year, an increase of more than $2,000 since 1980, the Department of
Education reported Tuesday.
   ``The financial investment we are making in our children's
education is immense... We must produce better results for our
investment, for our young people, and for the future of our
nation,'' said Education Secretary William J. Bennett in releasing
the agency's back-to-school forecast.
   The new estimate puts spending on education well ahead of
inflation in this decade, department statistics show.
   The $2,762 per pupil spending of the 1980-81 school year would
have risen to $3,462, if simply adjusted to reflect increases in
the federal Consumer Price Index. Yet the department expects
spending to top that by nearly 39 percent.
   Increased spending by state and local governments in an effort
to improve schools was cited by statistician Vance Grant as a major
reason for spending being ahead of inflation.
   During the same period, between the 1980-81 school year and
1988-89, salaries for teachers have increased from $17,644 to
$29,573, the report shows.
   Since inflation would have raised teacher pay to just $21,286 in
the period, their salaries led inflation by the same amount as
per-pupil spending did, 39 percent.
   Overall, the agency expects education spending at all levels,
public and private, to rise to $328 billion for the coming school
year, a record. That is up from $308.8 billion last year and $182.8
billion in 1980-81.
   Spending by colleges and universities is expected to reach $132
billion, up 6.6 percent from last year, while elementary and
secondary spending is up 6.0 percent to $196 billion.
   Total enrollment in the nation's schools and colleges is
expected to reach 58.5 million students. That's about 100,000 more
than last year, four-fifths of which are accounted for by increases
in elementary and secondary enrollment.
   Elementary enrollments continue to rise because of the surge in
births that began in 1977, rising from 32.38 million last year to
32.84 million. The number of students in high school continues to
decline somewhat, falling from last year's 13.51 million to 13.14
million expected in classes this fall.

<HEAD>US Criticizes Israel's Expulsion Of Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has questioned Israel's
expulsion of Palestinians from the troubled West Bank, but an
Israeli spokesman on Tuesday defended the policy as ``a measure of
last resort'' in dealing with agitation.
   The disagreement underscores a split between the U.S. and
Israeli governments over Palestinian unrest that has claimed more
than 200 lives in the last eight months.
   The latest U.S. complaint was registered unannounced Monday,
when Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead summoned Oded
Eran, the deputy Israeli ambassador, to his office.
   On several occasions, the State Department has also taken the
public offensive against Israel on the issue by authorizing
spokesmen to criticize the expulsion of Palestinians as unjustified.
   The U.S. position is that if individuals are accused of illegal
acts they should be charged and prosecuted, not summarily banned
from the territory that Israel has held since 1967.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley declined Tuesday to
provide any details about Whitehead's meeting with Eran, who is in
charge of the Israeli embassy while Ambassador Moshe Arad is on
home leave.
   It was learned, however, that Whitehead, who is filling in for
the vacationing Secretary of State George P. Shultz, told Erad the
U.S. government was unhappy with the expulsions.
   Yossi Gal, the Israeli embassy spokesman, declined to describe
the session. However, he said that in trying to cope with violence
on the West Bank and in Gaza, the Israeli government uses
expulsions ``only as a last resort.''
   Gal said the expulsions are carried out ``in conformity with the
law of the land and subject to review of the Israeli high court.''
   ``It is done as a measure of last resort in order to try to
ensure public safety and is used only when we are convinced it is
the best way to handle the instigators and the inciters in the
territories,'' the spokesman added.

   escalated over the government's count of the dead and injured in an
earthquake in the India-Nepal border region.
   Women dressed in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples
in the quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and
present their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in
the Hindu trinity.
   ''If god is pleased, nothing will happen,'' said one woman, who
refused to give her name.
   Nepal said more than 500 were killed and 1,000 injured in
Sunday's temblor, the deadliest to strike the Himalayan region in
38 years.
   The official toll given by Indian officials varied.
   Government officials closely involved in rescue operation said
200 people were killed and 2,000 injured on the Indian side of the
border.
   The Bihar government issued a statement Tuesday night, saying
186 people were killed and 1,300 others were injured.
   The Agriculture Minister, Bhajan Lal, told Parliament in the
federal government's preliminary report on the disaster that only
164 bodies had been found. Lal acknowledged the death toll would
rise but ''probably not to the levels earlier apprehended.''

   William N. ``Red'' King has died 48 years
after becoming the nation's first enlisted paratrooper.
   King, who died Saturday at the age of 71, was the first enlisted
man out of the airplane on Aug. 16, 1940, when the U.S. Army's
parachute test platoon made its initial jump over Fort Benning near
Columbus.
   He followed Lt. William T. Ryder out of the plane, according to
Terri Floyd of the Fort Benning public affairs office.
   King was supposed to be the second jumper among the enlisted
men, but he told an interviewer in 1982. ``The guy ahead of me, I
won't say his name, wouldn't jump.''
   So after the other trooper was pulled from the door, King
stepped in and stepped out of the converted bomber circling above
Fort Benning's Lawson Field.
   ``They used to call him the Spartan because he wasn't afraid of
the devil himself. After he made that jump, the others said, `The
Spartan did it, we have to do it,''' his wife, Mildred, once said.
   ``Everybody in there was scared, or rather anxious, but when
that guy froze up, I wanted it more,'' said King, who retired as a
master sergeant in 1960.
   King jumped into Normandy on D-Day and into Holland with the
506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne.
   King was a member of the 50-man test platoon, formed to become
the United States' paratroops. The Army decided to form the platoon
after watching the Germans' use of paratroops during their
invasions of Belgium, Norway and France.
   The 50 men, mostly athletes, were culled from 200 members of the
501st Battalion of the 29th Infantry, which later became the First
Airborne Battalion. They were put through two months of secret
training in several locations.
   The night before the first practice jump, the men drew numbers
from the helmet of Lemuel Pitts of Columbus to decided the order of
the jump.
   Pitts said the unnamed private wouldn't sell the No. 1 ticket
for any price. King drew No. 2 and Pitts was No. 3.
   Survivors include King's wife; a son and a sister.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   A blind man had his guide dog on
hand while his wife gave birth after hospital officials agreed to a
compromise between the needs of the dog and the baby.
   Brad Schuler, 23, and his Seeing Eye dog, Theo, were in a
critical stage of the dog's training Aug. 14 when Schuler's wife,
Teresa, went into labor. Schuler had told officials at Traverse
City Osteopathic Hospital that he couldn't be separated from the
70-pound Labrador retriever and asked to bring him into the
delivery room.
   Schuler said that because he and the dog had been together for
just a month, a separation could have made the dog distraught and
undone 18 months of training.
   But federal law prohibits dogs, even Seeing Eye dogs, from
delivery rooms.
   After consulting with state and federal health officials and
colleagues at more than 20 other hospitals, officials decided to
let Theo watch the couple from the bathroom while Mrs. Schuler lay
in labor for six hours until giving birth to a baby girl, Stephanie.
   The dog ``handled it real well,'' Schuler said. ``He was a
professional.''
   ``I had my reservations,'' said Julie Dixon, who delivered the
infant. ``But it went very smoothly. I don't know if Brad could
have been there (otherwise) because he needed to be with his dog.
That is a heck of a choice to have to make.''

   The sunken ferry Ellis Island, which carried 12
million immigrants to Manhattan and New Jersey, was outfitted with
pontoons Tuesday but sprang a leak before workers could refloat it.
   A Navy crew started pumping water out of the vessel at 10 a.m.
and attached pontoons to it an hour later, said Manny Strumpf, a
spokesman for the National Park Service.
   At around noon, the pressure caused an 8-foot by 12-foot plywood
patch to collapse over the engine room, and water rushed back into
the boat, said Strumpf. The pumping was halted until Wednesday.
   Strumpf said it normally would take several hours for the ferry,
aided by the rising tide, to float to the surface.
   Work began in April to refloat the vessel, which sank in 1968 in
a slip between the northern and southern portions of the 27.5-acre
island.
   The double-decked ferry began service in 1904 for what was then
the Bureau of Immigration. It made its last run Nov. 29, 1954, and
was docked at Ellis Island until it sank.
   The 160-foot-long vessel could carry 1,000 immigrants in its
hold and about 25 officials and visitors on the top. It also was
outfitted with a 12-bed sick bay and a padded cell for violent
mental patients.
   Now, all that remains of the ferry is its 160-foot by 45-foot
cast-iron hull.
   Five Naval Reserve units have removed 500 tons of mud and
patched holes in the deck. Divers brought up benches, linoleum
tile, map fixtures, pulley systems, a captain's chair and other
items.
   The Park Service decided the sunken ferry had become a
navigational hazard. The channel is being dredged for newer ferries.
   ``Its raising is the first step in resolving the problem while
respecting the ship's historical significance,'' the Park Service
said in a statement.

<HEAD>Indicator of Demand For Manufactured Goods Down Sharply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, hurt
by a drop in demand in the volatile transportation sector, fell a
sharp 7 percent in July, the biggest setback in four years, the
government reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last at least three years, fell $8.8 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $116.6 billion last month as demand dropped off
for ships and tanks, autos and aircraft.
   The July decline was the largest since a 7.2 percent drop in
April 1984. But it followed on the heels of an 8.7 percent June
increase, which had been the largest one-month advance in more than
six years.
   Economists said they were not concerned by the turn-about,
contending that it primarily reflected the fact that orders for
expensive capital goods were notoriously volatile from month to
month. They said the July report did nothing to shake their belief
that manufacturing will remain strong in the months ahead.
   ``The July drop is not indicating any real weakness in the
industrial sector of the economy,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior
economist at Merrill Lynch. ``The backlog of unfilled orders is
sufficiently fat that we should have very solid production gains
for the rest of the year.''
   The manufacturing sector has been one of the economy's standouts
in 1988 as American producers have benefited from a weaker dollar,
which has made their products more competitive on overseas markets.
   Analysts said that even though the dollar has been gaining in
value since June they saw little danger that American goods would
be priced out of overseas markets.
   ``July should not be seen as anything but a one-month pause in
what has been a very strong area of economic activity,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Michael Evans, head of his own Washington-based economic
forecasting firm, said the orders report should calm inflation
fears that have been building in the financial markets because of
concerns that factory operating rates were at such high levels.
   ``The orders numbers are back to normal. Everybody knew that the
June number was a fluke,'' he said. ``This is entirely consistent
with the fact that we're going to have slower growth in the second
half.''
   The big surge in June and the hefty drop in July reflected wide
swings in orders for transportation goods, which had soared by 33.3
percent in June only to plunge 21.2 percent in July to a monthly
total of $29.7 billion.
   About half of the July drop in transportation was attributed to
a decline in defense orders for ships and tanks with the rest of
the weakness coming from declines in orders for autos and aircraft.
   Without the big swings in transportation, orders would have
fallen 0.9 percent in July after rising 0.7 percent in June.
   Military orders fell by 43.9 percent in July to $7.8 billion
following a 68.8 percent surge in this volatile category in the
previous month.
   Orders in the category of non-defense capital goods were
basically unchanged in July at $35.4 billion following a big 12.4
percent increase in June. This sector, which reflects industry
plans to expand and modernize production facilities, has been
strong all year as manufacturers have boosted spending to meet
rising export demand.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel dropped 0.3 percent in
July to $12.2 billion, the second consecutive small monthly decline.
   Orders for the machinery category which includes computers fell
5.6 percent to $20.7 billion while a second machinery category rose
3.8 percent to $19.2 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods dropped 2.6 percent to $113.4 billion
following a 1.5 percent increase in June.

   The mother, identified by police as Sueann Check, 21, of New
Britain, admitted she had the baby Friday and went back to work at
Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby Shop, police Sgt. Richard G. Beck said.
   The healthy baby was discovered behind the shopping mall by a

<HEAD>Former Black Panther Refuses Prison Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther Huey Newton told
officials today that he won't leave the prison where he's been
serving time for a parole violation unless a fellow inmate and
former Panther is also released.
   The other inmate _ convicted killer Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt _
two weeks ago lost his eighth bid for parole after a state panel
called him a ``danger to the public.''
   Pratt, a former deputy defense minister of the Black Panther
Party, is serving a life term for murdering a Santa Monica woman
during a $30 robbery. He was convicted in 1972 of killing
27-year-old Caroline Olsen.
   Pratt's supporters contend that he is a political prisoner and
the victim of police efforts to jail Panther leaders and dismantle
the Oakland-based radical movement of the late 1960s and early 70s.
   San Quentin spokeswoman Jeanne Ballatore said that prison
officers filed a disciplinary action against Newton for refusing to
obey a direct order by guards to prepare for his release today. He
was serving a 60-day sentence.
   A state parole board panel at the prison will hold an informal
hearing today to review the case and decide whether the offense
merits additional time in custody, she said.
   Newton has the option of accepting their recommendation and
remaining in prison if that is their finding, Ballatore said.
   Whatever the board rules, Newton may refuse the recommendation
and remain in custody pending a complete hearing, she said.
   Newton was charged with the 1967 killing of an Oakland policeman
and convicted of manslaughter, but that conviction was overturned
on appeal after he served two years in prison. The charge was
dropped after two retrials ended in hung juries.
   He was convicted in 1974, because of an assault conviction in
1964, of possessing a firearm allegedly used in the pistol-whipping
of his tailor. He then fled the country and lived for three years
in Cuba. He was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with
the incident.
   Newton is scheduled to finish parole on Feb. 8, 1989.
   He was jailed at San Quentin for parole violations that included
failure to submit to drug testing and failure to advise his parole
officer that he had been arrested for investigation of driving
under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

   A tropical depression in the Caribbean fizzled and
was downgraded today to a tropical wave, while two other
depressions brewed in the Atlantic as peak hurricane season
approaches.
   ``We were expecting this one to have really picked up steam by
now, but that just hasn't materialized,'' forecaster Bob Case said
of the tropical wave about 300 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica.
   The system, which at its strongest had winds of nearly 30 mph,
was still producing widespread showers and thunderstorms over the
Caribbean. The system will continue to be watched, but regeneration
is unlikely, the National Hurricane Center reported.
   Meanwhile, the newest tropical depression formed Monday in the
middle Atlantic Ocean, east of the Lesser Antilles. The
westward-moving system's highest sustained winds were near 35 mph
around a loose center roughly 100 miles east of the island of
Dominica, forecasters said in a noon EDT advisory today. The
depression was moving westward at 20 mph and was not expected to
change in course or strength though today.
   A third depression was located about 350 miles northwest of the
northernmost Cape Verde Islands, off west Africa. It was moving
west-northwest at 15 mph into colder water, a course and speed it
was expected to maintain for the next day or two. Its highest
sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph.
   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74
mph.
   There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 Atlantic
Ocean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength.
   Case noted earlier that three depressions at the same time is
normal at this point in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began
June 1 and ends Nov. 30.
   ``We're really approaching the peak of the season,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Married women aged 18-44 are nearly twice as
likely as unmarried women to say they are very satisfied with life,
according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday.
   Overall, 44 percent in the national survey of 1,000 women said
they were very satisfied with their lives and another 44 percent
said they were mostly satisfied, as opposed to the third choice,
not satisfied.
   Money, marriage and part-time employment were the most common
factors. Fifty-seven percent of women with family incomes of
$35,000 or more said they were very satisfied, compared to 29
percent of women with incomes less than $15,000.
   Similarly, 53 percent of married women said they were very
satisfied, compared to 23 percent of unmarried women. And 52
percent of women who work part time said they were very satisfied,
compared to 41 percent of full-time workers.
   Of those with children, 46 percent said they were very satisfied
with their lives. Of those with no children, only slightly fewer,
39 percent, took that choice.
   The poll's margin of error for the entire sample was plus or
minus three points, but as in all polls it was greater for
subgroups. The poll, conducted by telephone June 17-21, was
commissioned by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., which makes
birth-control products.

   The money was gone but the memories
remained locked in a purse stolen 35 years ago.
   Mary Ellen Thomas remembers the night of Aug. 15, 1953, whe she
had just cashed her $120.25 paycheck for two weeks' work as a
cashier at the Cal-Neva Lodge in Crystal Bay, Nev., on the north
shore of Lake Tahoe.
   She was 22-year-old Mary Ellen Hall then, and a New York steak
cost $2.75.
   She remembers that it was her first summer away from home and
she had a get-together with friends to celebrate payday.
   At evening's end she rode back to the hotel with a co-worker who
made some unsuccesful advances. He was so mad, she remembers he
snatched her handbag.
   But last week the owner of the Cal-Neva Lodge, Charles Bluth,
presented Ms. Thomas with the handbag, uncovered last summer during
remodeling. The purse was stashed inside a wall.
   The 57-year-old retired teacher from Dana Point was tracked down
through her Social Security number.
   ``I'd like to think I've changed. I'm not so naive,'' Ms. Thomas
said. ``But in many ways, I'm very much the same.''
   Ms. Thomas will keep her purse for a while to show off to
friends. But she's promised to return it to the Cal-Neva Lodge
where it will become a part of the lodge's history display.

<HEAD>Study Says START Treaty Would Do Little To Cut War Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed treaty to cut U.S. and Soviet
long-range nuclear arsenals would do little to reduce casualties in
a war because it does not eliminate the most advanced weapons,
according to a new study.
   In an article published in the September issue of Scientific
American, four scholars estimate that 12 million to 27 million
Americans and 15 million to 32 million Soviets would die in the
initial stages of a nuclear holocaust, and that tens of millions
more would die later of starvation and disease.
   The Scientific American article, by Frank Von Hippel, Barbara G.
Levi, Theodore A. Postol and William H. Daugherty, breaks new
ground by estimating the possible number of victims based on the
proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which would slash
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent.
   Their calculations are based on the assumption that the
superpowers, with reduced nuclear aresenals, would concentrate on
military rather than civilian targets.
   The estimates include the number of people killed by each
warhead, those killed shortly thereafter by ``superfires'' ignited
by the intense heat of nuclear explosions, and those who are likely
to die from the immediate effects of radiation.
   Estimates of the number of people who could die in a nuclear war
vary greatly. Many more would die if the superpowers concentrated
on civlian, rather than military, targets.
   Both superpowers have enough warheads to enable them, ``even
after their strategic forces had suffered a worst case nuclear
attack,'' to explode the equivalent of 200 megatons over enemy
cities and cause about 100 million immediate deaths in the United
States and Soviet Union, according to the Scientific American
article.
   A U.S. government study released last year reached a similar
conclusion. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which directs
the U.S. civil defense program, predicted that most American
manufacturing and administrative centers would be destroyed in a
nuclear war, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 111.91 million
people.
   The authors of the Scientific American article, in calculating
the relationship between the proposed START agreement and the
number of likely casualities, concluded that a ``dangerous
situation can be prevented if nuclear forces are structured in such
a way that neither side would gain an advantage by striking first.''
   ``A START agreement as outlined in the current negotiations
would not achieve this, since it would allow each side to retain
its most modern multiple-warhead missiles,'' the article said.
   The authors hypothesized that if each side kept multiple-warhead
missiles rather than switching to single-warhead missiles, they
would favor so-called ``counterforce'' attacks designed to destroy
an enemy's nuclear arsenal in the opening minutes of a war.
   Such a counterforce strike could vastly reduce the ability of an
opponent to launch a counterattack.
   The authors estimated that there are 1,215 military facilities
in the United States and 1,740 in the Soviet Union.
   ``The disparity between the numbers is due to the fact that the
Soviet Union has more missile silos than the United States,'' they
said.
   Many projected victims reside in cities near military
installations, such as: command posts in Washington; air fields for
tankers in Chicago, Milwaukee, Phoenix and Salt Lake City; nuclear
submarine bases adjacent to San Francisco and Long Beach near Los
Angeles (and in the future, in New York); and Navy radio
transmitters in Jacksonville, Fla., San Diego and Sacramento, Calif.
   In the Soviet Union, such major cities as Moscow, Leningrad and
Vladivostok house military installations.
   The Soviets could use, in a counterforce attack against the
United States, 3,000 warheads with a total megaton yield of 3,000,
and the United States has available 4,000 warheads with a total
yield of 800 megatons, the study said. A megaton is defined as the
energy released by the detonation of one million tons of TNT.

   President Reagan predicted today that he
will be succeeded by George Bush and Dan Quayle because ``America
is not going to trade away our winning team for third-stringers.''
   In remarks prepared for delivery at a $500-a-person fund-raising
luncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., Reagan described the
Republican Party as ``strong, unified and ready to work for
victory.''
   He made no reference in his prepared remarks to the controversy
surrounding Bush's choice of Quayle, a second-term GOP senator from
Indiana, as his running mate. Quayle has been the subject of
controversy for joining the Indiana National Guard during the
Vietnam war, making himself immune from the draft.
   ``America is not going to trade away our winning team for
third-stringers with a weak defense, a foreign policy of errors,
curve-ball campaign promises, a set of policies to be named later,
and billions of dollars in higher taxes,'' the president said.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis told a news
conference in Beverly, Mass., ``I think it will be the American
people who decide who belongs in the major leagues and who belongs
in the bush leagues. I think it's Dukakis and (Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd) Bentsen who belong in the major
leagues.''
   Earlier in the day, Reagan was asked by reporters after a
signing ceremony for trade legislation if Bush should drop Quayle
from the Republican ticket. ``No. He's a fine man and
well-qualified,'' Reagan responded.
   Urging the re-election of Wilson, who faces a challenge from
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, Reagan said he sees ``a real
chance that Pete may be part of a Republican majority in the
Senate.''
   ``And wouldn't that be a nice gift for President George Bush and
Vice President Dan Quayle?'' he asked.
   Reagan said that, in 1984, ``our opponents, wrongheaded as their
policies may have been, at least ran in the clear light of day,''
he said. ``They ran as the liberals they were.''
   ``But that has changed,'' he said. ``The first sign of this
deceptive strategy came in 1986, when many of their liberal Senate
candidates ran stealth campaigns, avoiding the tough issues and
using the language of conservatism to conceal their true beliefs.''
   ``In 1988, we are seeing this kind of covert liberalism at the
national level and to an extraordinary degree,'' the president said.
   Reagan will meet privately with Bush on Wednesday before they
appear together at a rally in Los Angeles. It will be their first
meeting since controversy erupted over Bush's selection of Quayle.

   An Indianapolis radio station has pulled
from the air a song lampooning Republican vice presidential nominee
Dan Quayle's National Guard service, officials said Tuesday.
   WFBQ's controversial morning team of Bob Kevoian and Tom
Griswold first aired ``I Spent the War in Indiana'' Monday. The
lyrics were written by Griswold and local musician Rickey Rydell.
   Station manager Chris Wheat said the song was removed from the
air at around 9 a.m. Tuesday and a decision will be made later in
the week on whether to continue airing it.
   ``The initial reaction was pretty negative, and pretty
emotional,'' said Wheat, adding the listeners who called ``feel
strongly one way or the other.''
   The song is a reaction to reports that Quayle got a spot in the
National Guard in 1969 because of family influence while others
were drafted and sent to Vietnam.
   Its lyrics include, ``I spent the war in Indiana, Getting shot
was not for me. I never went to 'Nam, I never saw Saigon, I only
watched it on T.V.''

   Thieves burglarized the offices of the
U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia, who has been conducting a
highly publicized investigation into allegations of defense
contracting fraud at the Pentagon.
   About six suites of a commercial office building in Alexandria,
Va., across the Potomac River from Washington, were broken into
sometime between 9:30 p.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, Dennis Butler,
a spokesman for the Alexandria Police Department, said Tuesday.
   Butler said it appeared that the burglars entered the building
through an unlocked door and punched holes through the gypsum board
walls to gain access to the offices, which included the suites of
U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson and a private law firm.
   The only items missing were two videocassette recorders and a
television set, Butler said. No confidential material was stolen.
   An aide to Hudson said the offices that were broken into
contained no confidential files or information about criminal
matters. Such information is stored in a more secure part of the
office to which the thieves did not gain access.

   Grocery prices jumped 1.4 percent in July, the
biggest monthly increase since early 1984, as the drought's effects
reached supermarket checkout counters, the government said Tuesday.
   But there was little evidence of accelerating retail price
inflation elsewhere in the U.S. economy. Excluding food, overall
retail prices rose just 0.3 percent for the month, slower than the
pace of the first half of 1987, the Labor Department said.
   Including the drought-related price spikes for food _ which
accounts for about one-sixth of people's spending _ consumer prices
rose 0.4 percent in July, an annual rate of 5.2 percent.
   ``Despite all the talk about inflationary pressures, it's very
difficult to find much in the way of evidence of it, even with this
huge increase for food,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist for the
Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.
   Energy costs were up 0.3 percent, largely because of 0.7 percent
rise in gasoline prices, but both home heating oil and electric
rates declined. Even with the July increase, gasoline prices are
still lower than they were last December and 28.1 percent below
their peak in March 1981.
   Housing expenses _ which account for 42 percent of what people
spend _ rose at the same 0.3 percent monthly pace they have
maintained since February, with slightly lower repair costs
offsetting slightly higher rents and mortgage payments.
   Retail auto prices were unchanged and clothing prices dropped
0.6 percent, the second consecutive monthly decline, despite
increases in both on the wholesale level in July, the Labor
Department said.
   Economists said it is becoming increasingly apparent that retail
outlets are finding it harder to pass along wholesale price
increases.
   ``The real question is whether some of it will start seeping
through; there certainly hasn't been the surge that people worried
about,'' said Larry Chimerine of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., economic forecasting firm.
   ``We're seeing a lot more consumer resistence than we used to,
and that is going to keep inflation down,'' said Michael Evans, a
Washington economic consultant. ``Part of it is the availability of
imports, but consumers also have become so use to rebates and sales
that they won't buy without them.''
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that orders for
``big ticket'' durable goods plunged 7 percent in July, the biggest
drop in four years, primarly because of huge declines in orders for
cars and decreased military purchases.
   The decline had been anticipated after durable-goods orders
skyrocketed 8.7 percent in June, the biggest monthly increase in
more than six years.
   ``This should not be taken as anything more than a one-month
pause in what has been a very strong area of economic activiity,''
said Allen Sinai of the Boston Co., a New York financial consultant.
   In a third report, the Labor Department said Americans' average
weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, climbed 0.6 percent
in July, the best showing since a 1.2 percent increase in April.
   Workers benefited from a rise in hourly earnings plus an
increase in the number of hours worked, which was only partially
offset by the boost in consumer prices in July. The advance left
Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 0.2 percent higher than they
were a year ago.
   The higher food prices from the four months of dry weather in
the Farm Belt had been anticipated and, if anything, analysts were
surprised that they were not bigger.
   ``The food prices increases are not that big or that
unexpected,'' said Chimerine. ``We'll have a second round of
drought-related increases later on, but it's not going to be a
phenomenal increase.''
   The 1.4 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 9.6
percent jump in egg costs, a 7.4 percent boost for poultry and a
4.7 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables.
   ``These increases reflect rising input prices, at least
partially due to the adverse summer weather,'' the Labor Department
said.
   Cereal and bakery product prices gained 1.1 percent, while
cooking oil posted a 1.0 percent price increase.
   Despite widespread increases for most foods, meat costs overall
declined slightly as drought-stricken farmers trimmed their herds.
Pork prices dropped 2.2 percent and beef and veal prices rose just
0.1 percent.
   The second major food price spike resulting from the drought is
not expected until the end of this year or early 1989 as meat
shortages from the early slaughters start showing up.
   Food costs overall rose 1.0 percent in July; slower advances of
0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, were posted for
restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages.
   For the first seven months of 1988, inflation on the retail
level is running at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, just a tick
above the 4.4 percent rate for all of 1987.

   This year's hot, dry weather should not
keep Vermont's trees from displaying their famous array of fall
colors, but the dry spell could prompt the trees to turn color
early, experts said Tuesday.
   ``Here and there on the hillsides you've got an occasional tree
that's starting to turn, although it's nothing to get alarmed
about,'' said Arlo Sterner of Wolcott, who's been monitoring
foliage for the state for 40 years.
   ``I don't want to sound like the perennial hyper-salesperson,
but I really think we can look forward to some gorgeous foliage
this fall,'' said George Buzzell, a forester from Newport who also
surveys foliage for the Vermont Travel Division. ``If you plan to
come to Vermont, be prepared to pick up a lot of film and use it.''
   Vermont's precipitation is 5 inches below normal so far this
year, the National Weather Service said. The state also experienced
an infestation from an insect called the pear thrips, which
defoliated nearly 500,000 acres, mostly in southern Vermont, but
foresters say those trees grew a second set of leaves.
   Predicting the start of the season is always difficult, but it
usually begins the second week of September in the northern part of
the state and lasts through most of October.
   The season's length and brilliance are affected by rainfall,
sun, temperature and other weather factors. Too much sun, rain or
heat retard the foliage.
   Sterner and Joe Luisi of the weather service said a dry year
usually means an earlier season. Luisi said a spell of chilly
weather next month also could prompt the leaves to turn.
   The uncertainty doesn't seem to have discouraged prospective
visitors. Inns and lodges are booking their usual throng of autumn
customers, and the state Travel Division is swamped with telephone
calls.
   Division spokesman John Cashman said the peak weekend of Oct.
8-10 should be especially busy because Oct. 10 is not only Columbus
Day, but Thanksgiving Day in Canada.

   The State Department on Tuesday urged the
Polish government to employ reconciliation, not force, in dealing
with spreading labor unrest.
   ``Free labor unions can help the Polish economic reform effort,
not hinder it,'' said a statement read by spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley.
   ``Indeed, it is hard to see how economic reform can succeed
without the participation of free trade unions. Economic reform is
a truly national undertaking. It must include all the people.''
   The mildly worded statement contained no direct criticism of the
Polish government. U.S.-Polish relations have improved since
martial law was lifted in 1983, but the ban on the Solidarity labor
movement remained and the statement concentrated on that issue.
   ``As tension mounts in Poland, the United States continues to
encourage dialogue and national reconciliation,'' it said, ``not
confrontation and intimidation by force as the means to resolve
Poland's difficulties.''
   The Polish government has imposed special security measures and
scheduled a session of Parliament next Wednesday to try to cope
with the worst strikes since 1981.
   In Warsaw, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said at least 20
illegal strikes had threatened anarchy in the country. Polish
authorities have denounced the organizers as outside agitators and
even terrorists.
   Mrs. Oakley said, however, the strikes were ``a clear indication
of the wishes of the Polish people and their support for
Solidarity.''
   She said Poland needed economic reform and that trade unions
should play an important role.
   ``The United States is watching developments in Poland
closely,'' the statement said.
   In a separate statement, the State Department accused the
government of Czechoslovakia of using force against peaceful
demonstrators and urged the release of dozens who were detained.
   The demonstration in Prague on Sunday marked the 20th
anniversary of the use of Soviet troops to crush a reform movement
in the Warsaw Pact country.
   ``The demonstration points once more to the pressing need for
the Czechoslovak government to re-evaluate the tragic events of
1968 and address the legacy of political repression and economic
stagnation,'' the department said.
   It called the demonstration ``an apparently spontaneous
outpouring of frustration and hope by the people of
Czechoslovakia.''

   The mother of a 7-year-old girl, who found a
golf ball-sized chunk of cocaine in her backpack and shared it with
school chums, was ordered to stand trial on charges of drug
possession and child endangerment.
   Maria Christina Torres, 39, of Topanga, accused of stashing the
cocaine in daughter Angelina's backpack in June, was told Monday to
return Sept. 6 for arraignment on two felony counts. She remains
free on $25,000 bail.
   Angelina, subpoenaed as a prosecution witness, testified she
found the cocaine while looking through her backpack at school. She
later tasted it and shared it with schoolmates.
   If convicted, Torres faces up to seven years in prison, said
Deputy District Attorney Larry Diamond.
   Defense attorney Richard A. Walton argued there was no proof his
client intended to sell the cocaine and that there was insufficient
evidence to support a child endangering charge.

   A Christian film critic says protests
against ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' backfired, making people
curious about Martin Scorsese's movie.
   ``It's slander, it's libel, it's evil, it's bigotry and it's
wrong,'' Theodore Baehr said Monday during a taping of ``The John
Ankerberg Show,'' a religious television program.
   The movie, based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, has drawn much
attention for its portrayal of Jesus Christ as questioning his
divinity and dreaming of making love to Mary Magdalene.
   Baehr, who reviews films for ``Movieguide,'' a Christian index
to movies and entertainment, compared the portrayal of Jesus by
Willem Dafoe to ``Don Rickles playing Dr. Martin Luther King.''
   But he conceded: ``There was error when certain members of the
Christian community felt the need to go public and called a press
conference to condemn the movie.''
   ``The initial plan was for Don Wildmon (head of the American
Family Association of Tupelo, Miss., which spearheaded the boycott)
to reach his support base of 2{ million and to reach our audience
through 300-plus Christian radio stations and 25 magazines to speak
out against the film.
   ``When the secular press got wind of the protest, it hurt,''
Baehr said. ``In fact, watching the press conference in Los
Angeles, I wondered if those speaking against the film were working
for Universal Pictures (which distributed the film). It was the
best advertising they could receive.''

   Hockey great Wayne Gretzky says his tears
were real.
   A day after Gretzky was traded by the Edmonton Oilers to the Los
Angeles Kings, the Edmonton Journal on Aug. 10 quoted the Canadian
team's owner, Peter Pocklington, as saying: ``He's a great actor. I
thought he pulled it off beautifully when he showed how upset he
was.''
   The remark ``bothered me. I did a lot for him and the team,''
Gretzky said.
   ``I was a guest on a soap opera (``The Young and the Restless'')
in 1981, and obviously he never saw a tape of that,'' Gretzky said
joking about his acting abilities Monday on NBC-TV's ``The Tonight
Show With Johnny Carson.''
   Since Gretzky's arrival in the entertainment capital, it has
been speculated he might try an acting career.
   ``I'm sticking to hockey,'' said the eight-time National Hockey
League Most Valuable Player.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Tuesday that the film
``The Last Temptation of Christ'' is offensive and he wouldn't see
it.
   But Cuomo, a Roman Catholic, said producers had a right to make
the film.
   ``I don't see the point of my seeing it,'' Cuomo said in an
interview with Albany public radio station WAMC. ``The idea of
profaning the Christ figure by showing him to be as human as the
rest of us and leering at a woman and desiring her sexually is
something that I find offensive to good taste.''
   The film, which opened in theaters earlier this month, includes
a scene in which a crucified Jesus Christ hallucinates that he has
married Mary Magdalene.
   Roman Catholic bishops have urged the country's 53 million
Catholics to boycott the film. Other religious groups have
demonstrated against it.

for the birth of his first child, Princess Beatrice of York,
Buckingham Palace said Tuesday.
   The 28-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant left Monday night, hours
after the palace announced the baby's name and released the first
official pictures of her, which were taken by the prince.
   Andrew, who is based on HMS Edinburgh, flew to London from
Singapore on Aug. 7 for the birth. Princess Beatrice was born Aug.
8, 1988, at 8:18 p.m., considered by Chinese astrologers one of the

   Actor George Peppard is moving his one-man show
about Ernest Hemingway to San Francisco and beyond, if the
reception is good.
   The 59-year-old actor, known as Hannibal Smith of television's
``The A-Team,'' says the play about the larger-than-life author has
been a career highlight for him.
   ``Something like this happens once in a career, something this
good, this literate,'' he said in a recent interview.
   The play, ``Papa: The Legendary Lives of Ernest Hemingway,'' is
set in Cuba and depicts a day in the life of Hemingway when he was
58, three years before his 1961 suicide.
   Written by John De Groot and produced by Peppard's Lime Tree
Productions, the play ends its run here Sunday. After San
Francisco, he hopes to see it go to Broadway.
   Reviews have been mixed. But Peppard said people who knew
Hemingway have told him his portrayal brings to life the author of
``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' and ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
   ``I spent a lot of years doing a lot of (things) that I didn't
enjoy,'' he said. ``Now I'm doing something that I feel has great
quality and is extremely entertaining. I can stand a few years of
this.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis today ridiculed George Bush's plan for
a flexible freeze to cut the federal deficit as ``the son of voodoo
economics'' while President Reagan dismissed the Democratic ticket
as ``third-stringers.''
   Bush, campaigning on the West Coast today, basked in the warmth
of a post-convention poll giving him a slim lead but he continued
to feel the heat over running mate Dan Quayle's military record and
alleged involvement with a woman lobbyist.
   Quayle snapped at reporters staking out his home in the
Washington suburb of McLean, Va., today, saying ``This is getting a
little bit outrageous and I'm getting a little bit indignant about
just one bum rap after another.''
   Reagan rallied a Republican fund-raising luncheon with criticism
of the Democrats.
   ``America is not going to trade away our winning team for
third-stringers with a weak defense, a foreign policy of errors,
curve-ball campaign promises, a set of policies to be named later,
and billions of dollars in higher taxes,'' the president said in
remarks prepared for the fund-raiser in California, where he will
campaign Wednesday with Bush at his side.
   Dukakis turned the fiscal criticism back on the GOP, saying
``there is no Republican plan'' to balance the budget. ``The vice
president is talking about a flexible freeze. That's like a melting
ice cube. ... That's the son of voodoo economics'' _ a phrase that
Bush used in 1980 to lampoon Reagan's theory of economics.
   Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen met Monday night with CIA
Director William Webster and other lawmakers and officials involved
in intelligence for a briefing on national security and foreign
affairs.
   In the first survey done entirely after the end of last week's
Republican National Convention, Bush and Quayle led Dukakis and
Bentsen by 46 percent to 40 percent.
   The CBS News poll of 1,221 registered voters across the country
had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Candidates typically
receive a boost in the polls after their party's convention.
   But half the respondents did not believe Quayle, 41, has the
experience to be a good president, and 28 percent were unsure.
Thirty-nine percent wished Bush had chosen someone else.
   Quayle, facing questions about whether he used his wealthy
family's connections to enter the National Guard and avoid being
drafted into combat in Vietnam, found a split jury in the poll.
   Forty percent said phone calls made to the guard on his behalf
represented ``an unfair attempt'' to ease his admission; 40 percent
said such calls were acceptable and 20 percent were unsure.
   Reservations about Quayle were also expressed Monday by Bush
supporters, although they rejected suggestions he be dropped from
the ticket.
   ``I think Quayle should assess and if he feels like he's hurting
the ticket, he ought to be man enough to step aside,'' Tommy
Thomas, chairman of the Bush steering committee in Florida, said
Monday.
   ``I want to get to know a lot more about him,'' said New Jersey
Gov. Thomas Kean, who delivered the keynote at last week's
convention in New Orleans.
   Gov. John R. McKernan of Maine said that when Quayle's name
first surfaced at the Republican National Convention as a possible
Bush choice ``I said I thought it would be a mistake. ... And,
unfortunately, I've been borne out to be right.''
   But Bush went all out to defend Quayle at a convention of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars, telling the audience of about 4,500 in
Chicago that the Indiana senator ``did not go to Canada and he did
not burn his draft card and he damn sure didn't burn the American
flag.''
   Bush was scheduled to tour a steel plant in Seattle, Wash., here
today before flying to Portland, Ore., and Sacramento, Calif. He
has a joint appearance scheduled with President Reagan on Wednesday
before returning to Houston, his adopted hometown.
   Quayle, in a hastily arranged appearance before the VFW, said no
influence was used to get him into the National Guard and none was
needed because there were vacancies at the time.
   ``My National Guard unit was never called up to active duty, but
let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say I've never
faced combat,'' he joked.
   He continued to face questions about the Guard and other issues.
The Daily News of Los Angeles today quoted two former lawyers for
one-time lobbyist Paula Parkinson who said the woman told the FBI
in 1981 that Quayle had propositioned her during a 1980 trip to
Florida.
   The lawyers said Parkinson told agents she refused the advance,
allegedly made during a golfing trip in which Parkinson, Quayle and
two other congressmen shared a cottage.
   Quayle adamantly denied a relationship with Parkinson. ``That is
just an absolute, flat-out falsehood. I had nothing to do with her
down there. I had nothing to do with her before, and I had nothing
to do with her afterwards,'' he said today.
   In his speech to the VFW, Bush again hit Dukakis as weak on
defense.
   ``I plan to negotiate strategic arms reductions with the
Soviets,'' Bush said. But, he added, ``I will not do what my
opponent has suggested _ get rid of the MX, the Midgetman, the B-1
bomber and two carrier battle groups. I will not make such
unilateral cuts in our defense.''
   Dukakis countered at a news conference, ``How anyone who sat
there and did nothing while we sold arms to the ayatollah can
seriously talk about leadership in the Persian Gulf is beyond me.''
   The Democratic candidate was continuing his two-day annual visit
of northern Massachusetts today, meeting with regional newspaper
executives, teen-agers involved in an anti-drug program and local
law enforcement officials.
   Dukakis also answered allegations by a Republican congressman
that he obtained a deferment until he finished Swarthmore College
during the Korean War.
   Dukakis said he asked to be drafted immediately after
graduation, and he spent 16 months in the demilitarized zone in
Korea after the fighting had stopped.
   ``I'm very proud of that service and very proud of the
opportunity it gave me to serve my country,'' said Dukakis.
   Quayle, who makes his first solo campaign tour on Wednesday, is
getting coaching from former Reagan aides with experience in
presidential politics. The new campaign staff was assembled by
aides to Bush.
   The Des Moines Register, an influential newspaper in the farm
belt, called today for Bush to replace Quayle because the senator
would, the paper said, remain ``a distraction from the issues
throughout the campaign.''
   ``It's tough to admit a mistake, but a willingness to see an
error and to rectify it is a far better quality in a would-be
president than a refusal to do so,'' the newspaper said in an
editorial.

   Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday
to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake
that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal.
   Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as
relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible
since Sunday's devastating quake.
   Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday,
while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the
size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.
   At least 531 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur
Thapa, additional secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry.
   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan, one of
the hardest-hit towns, and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once
three-story and five-story houses.
   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha said
as he toured the town.
   India reported an official death toll of 200, but the figure was
disputed by news media and opposition politicians who put the
Indian death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
   In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk
and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction. Women dressed
in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the
quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and present
their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindu
trinity.
   ``If God is pleased, nothing will happen,'' said one woman, who
refused to give her name.
   The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday when
most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.
It was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor
in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count
and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
   Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain
at the base of a steep hill. At least 131 bodies have been found in
the town of 100,000.
   Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of
bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal
monsoon rains.
   Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished
more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation. ``We will
continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the ones
remaining) are safe to live in,'' he said.
   British soldiers from a nearby Gurkha recruiting center pitched
in with cranes to aid the demolition. Dharan is in the heart of
regional famed for fierce Gurkha fighters who have served in the
British army for more than 150 years.
   Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the
government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes
were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors
of found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
   The hardest hit areas in India were in Bihar state just across
the Nepalese border.
   Rescuers in army helicopters searched for survivors in Bihar's
Darbhanga, Madhubani and Mungar districts. Other helicopters
ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police
trapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, India's poorest state.
   Heavy rains, overflowing rivers and submerged bridges and roads
hampered attempts by 1,000 Indian soldiers to provide assistance.
   In Nepal, 88-pound bags of rice were being distributed to
families affected by the quake, but officials were unable to give
any figures.
   International agencies operating in Nepal were gearing up to
contribute supplies or assistance but have not yet heard from the
government on what was wanted, according to several foreign relief
workers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shrestha said the mountain kingdom had not sought foreign aid
because ``we are still assessing the magnitude of the tragedy.''
Some supplies, medicine and health workers arrived in eastern Nepal
on Tuesday. Donors included UNICEF and the government of Japan and
Britain.
   Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Two-third of the
children under age of 5 suffer from malnutrition and life
expectancy is 52, according to UNICEF. A nation of 17 million,
Nepal has one doctor for every 22,650 people, compared with 5,000
people per doctor in India and 780 per doctor in the United States.
   Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's earthquake, and rumors
of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the
streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. The
rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of
mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing people from
their sleep.

<TEXT>
   Neither public protest nor U.S.
pressure has budged Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and the Panamanian
movement to oust the nation's de facto ruler appears mired in
uncertainty and despair.
   Noriega's political foes did not even draw much enthusiasm from
a huge anti-government demonstration that accompanied the funeral
Aug. 15 of a revered former president whom the military threw out
of office three times.
   Tens of thousands of people marched 40 and 50 abreast in the
funeral procession for Arnulfo Arias Madrid, but Roberto Aleman, a
leader of the opposition alliance, discounted its significance.
   ``In the short and medium term, I doubt that it will mean
much,'' he said. ``In the longer term, we may see some life put
back into the movement or we may see it fractionalized. The thing
is, Arnulfo is gone but Noriega's still here.''
   Behind Aleman's assessment was his concern, shared by other
opposition leaders, that the death could split the Authentic
Panamanian Party, which Arias founded and built into the country's
largest opposition force.
   ``There's no one of Arias Madrid's stature in the wings, but if
his followers can unite around someone it would certainly
strengthen the entire opposition movement,'' a Western diplomat
said privately. ``If they don't, the party is likely to be split
into a number of competing factions and that would just muddy
things up.''
   Noriega has weathered a 14-month-old opposition campaign to
force him out as commander of the 15,000-member Panama Defense
Forces, which include the armed forces and police.
   U.S. economic sanctions against Panama and federal indictments
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering have had little
visible impact on Noriega's standing.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, the president Noriega put into office,
rebelled and tried to fire the general a few days after the U.S.
indictments were handed up in February. Noriega arranged for the
National Assembly, which he controls, to dismiss Delvalle instead.
   In speeches, interviews and billboard advertisements, Noriega
says the government will hold a presidential election as planned in
May 1989.
   The main questions are whether Noriega will seek the presidency
and whether the opposition can unite long enough to defeat either
the general or the candidate he chooses. Some opposition leaders
speak of boycotting the election, but most do not see that as an
option.
   Another diplomat said: ``The U.S. sanctions haven't driven
Noriega out, it is doubtful they (Washington) will try a military
solution and there's no one in Panama who can singlehandedly carry
the opposition banner. The people are being driven to despair.
   ``There are a lot of people out there who are against Noriega _
very easily the majority, I'd say _ but they feel abandoned by the
United States and there's not one single opposition leader with
whom they feel comfortable.''
   Morton Abramowitz, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, visited Panama two weeks ago. Opposition
leaders who met him said he offered nothing new.
   One said, on condition his name not be used: ``I got the
impression that nothing will happen until after the (U.S.)
election, and then who knows what?'' Some observers had expected
Noriega to announce his presidential candidacy Aug. 12, his fifth
anniversary as commander of the Defense Forces.
   Noriega dropped no hints at the celebration, however. Instead,
he delivered another diatribe against the United States, accusing
it of creating a crisis in Panama to negate the 1977 treaties that
turn the Panama Canal over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   ``Many Panamanians wrongly thought that with the new treaties of
1977, Panama and the United States were beginning a permanent
honeymoon, forgetting that for the United States a treaty is no
more ... than a useful but ephemeral act,'' Noriega declared.
   On Sunday, the Panama Defense Forces rejected charges that its
troops are harassing U.S. military personnel and called the
accusations part of an effort to undermine the government.
   Its statement injected a note of sarcasm by saying U.S.
officials who make such accusations ``must have the IQ of a
3-year-old Cro-Magnon.''

<HEAD>Army Charges Pratt Consultant Stole Report By Rival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt & Whitney quickly dismissed a
consultant who the Army said stole a sensitive report by a rival in
a helicopter-engine competition, but the Army said it lacked the
evidence to press charges.
   An internal report obtained by The Hartford Courant said
consultant William Henry Maloney, 50, stole a 358-page progress
report on the LHTEC T-800 turbine helicopter-engine program from an
office of the Army Materiel Command's Aviation Branch on Dec. 8,
1986.
   Maloney, who was chief of the Aviation Branch until his
retirement as a colonel in 1984, returned the report two hours
later after an Army engineer noticed it missing and asked about it.
Maloney also lied about the incident, the Army said.
   Maloney said Monday that he is innocent of any criminal conduct.
``I did something stupid, but I didn't do anything wrong,'' he said.
   Maloney told the Courant he didn't take the report.
   The Army said the case is unrelated to the Justice Department
investigation into allegations of bribery and bid-rigging in
Pentagon procurement. Under scrutiny in that probe are consultants
for Pratt and Norden Systems, both divisions of Hartford-based
United Technologies Corp.
   LHTEC is a partnership of two major engine builders, the Allison
Gas Turbine Division of General Motors and the Garrett Engine
Division of Allied Signal Aerospace Co.
   LHTEC is competing against the team of Pratt and Textron
Lycoming of Stratford, Conn., to develop the T-800.
   At stake are $3.5 billion in T-800 production contracts and
domination of a class of turbine engines that can power smaller
airplanes, including business jets, as well as helicopters.
   William C. Campbell, director of communications for Allison,
said the report was a detailed account of LHTEC's progress in
developing the T-800, including technical information of keen
interest to competitors. But he said he wasn't sure the data would
give a rival an edge in competition for the T-800 contract.
   The Courant obtained the internal report of the Army's
investigation into the incident under the Freedom of Information
Act and reported on it in Tuesday's editions.
   Eugene J. Tallia, chief of Pratt's Washington office, said the
company suspended Maloney, who was under a one-year contract, eight
days after the incident. Maloney never offered to give Pratt the
LHTEC data, Tallia said.
   Army lawyers concluded there was probable cause to believe
Maloney committed ``criminal conversion,'' a theft in which a
perpetrator doesn't intend to permanently keep a stolen item, and
gave a false sworn statement to investigators.
   But Col. Anthony Wagner, deputy command counsel for the Army
Materiel Command, said no charges have been filed against Maloney
because Pratt denied ever having received or used information from
the report, leaving no way to prove criminal intent.
   He said the Army Materiel Command has barred Maloney from its
offices and Army investigators are holding Maloney's Pentagon pass.
   Maloney now works as senior Washington, D.C., representative for
the Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles, a major aircraft manufacturer.
   John Thorne, a spokesman for Northrop, said he couldn't comment
on the Army report because he hadn't read it.

   U.S. Customs seized a Bolivian passenger jet
Tuesday after inspectors found 46 pounds of cocaine in a box not
listed on the manifest, officials said.
   Lloyd Aereo Bolivian Flight 900 from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, landed
at Miami International Airport just before 7 a.m. Tuesday after a
stop in Panama.
   Customs agents saw a cardboard box that was not on the manifest
unloaded from the belly of the Boeing 727, said spokesman Cliff
Stallings.
   ``Inside was 46 pounds of cocaine wrapped in black plastic,
coated in heavy grease, and placed inside a plexiglass box inside
the cardboard box,'' Stallings said.
   The cocaine discovery was the ninth aboard an LAB plane since
March 5, 1986, for a total of 412 pounds, Stallings said.
   But the seizure of the aircraft was the Bolivian carrier's
first. He noted that Bolivia has signed the international treaty
requiring tough drug inspections and security, and which allows the
seizures.
   To reclaim the plane, LAB could have to pay a fine of up to
$1,000 per ounce of cocaine, or about $736,000, Stallings said.

<HEAD>Government Orders Troops Out Of Rangoon To Avoid Clashes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES W. HATTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese leaders ordered troops out of
central Rangoon on Tuesday to avoid clashes with demonstrators
protesting authoritarian rule as tens of thousands of people
marched there and in four other cities, diplomats and news reports
said.
   President Maung Maung's government for the first time
acknowledged the two days of massive protests late Tuesday.
State-run Radio Rangoon also reported the first shootings by
security forces since the rioting that toppled hard-line President
Sein Lwin on Aug. 12.
   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, said security forces in
Moulmein, 44 miles southeast of Rangoon, fired on demonstrators who
drove four vehicles at them Monday night. It did not say if anyone
was injured.
   The report said demonstrators also looted and destroyed a
customs warehouse there Tuesday morning, sank a motorboat and made
off with the agents' weapons. Sunday night, protesters destroyed a
government building in Sandoway, 90 miles northwest of Rangoon.
   It also reported demonstrations in Rangoon, the northern city of
Mandalay, and Meiktila south of Mandalay. It gave no crowd
estimates, but Japan's Kyodo News Service said 200,000 demonstrated
in Mandalay, Burma's second biggest city.
   Radio Rangoon said about 100 doctors and nurses of Rangoon
General Hospital, wearing their uniforms, joined the demonstrators
in the capital, marching along main streets and to the U.S.
Embassy. Another group, including 50 attorneys from the Rangoon
Lawyers' Council, marched separately.
   ``These two groups joined forces in front of the U.S. Embassy on
Merchant Street and gave speeches, and with those who came to
witness as spectators, the crowd swelled to about 4,000,'' it said.
   After leaving the embassy they marched through the streets and
``the crowd swelled to over 10,000,'' it said.
   ``During today's demonstration, there was no shooting at all by
the security forces and the crowd dispersed peacefully on their
own,'' it said.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said up to 100,000 people led by students
and about 100 saffron-robed monks marched through the capital
chanting anti-government slogans.
   A Western diplomat said Chief Justice Tin Aung Hein convinced
the government to withdraw the troops to avoid clashes while the
commission investigates ``the wishes of the people.'' The jurist
body was established when Maung Maung took power Friday, and is to
complete its work by Sept. 30.
   Soldiers had restricted the movement of the estimated 20,000
protesters who gathered Monday outside the Rangoon hospital, a
rallying point. But with the troops gone Tuesday, the demonstrators
surged through downtown streets.
   The diplomat also said a separate group of some 2,000 people sat
outside the U.S. Embassy and shouted ``Down with socialism!'' and
``Welcome democracy!'' He said they had picked the embassy ``to
publicize their cause.''
   An Asian diplomat, also speaking anonymously, said in a tour of
residential areas he saw for the first time Tuesday the national
flag hung upside down in an apparent protest.
   Students have mounted demonstrations in Rangoon almost daily
since they spearheaded the Aug. 8-12 rioting that toppled Sein Lwin
and, by official count, left 112 people dead in Rangoon.
   Maung Maung, the Western-educated attorney general, is the
former British colony's first civilian leader since the 1962
military coup replaced democracy with one-party rule.
   The demonstrators are seeking the end of the exclusive rule of
the Burma Socialist Program Party, a military-dominated autocracy
whose rigid policies have turned one of Southeast Asia's richest
nations into one of the world's poorest.
   The new government has freed at least 600 people arrested during
the rioting, including 100 on Tuesday. But several prominent
figures rounded up July 29-30 in Rangoon are still held. They
include Aung Gyi, Burma's leading dissident, and Sein Win, the
Burma correspondent of The Associated Press.
   On Tuesday, AP President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi
sent a telex to Maung Maung stating: ``It is our strongly felt hope
that one of the first acts of your new administration will be the
release of our correspondent.''
   He said Sein Win, 66, has worked for AP for two decades and
there was no indication he was involved in anti-government
activities, as authorities have claimed.
   Boccardi noted Sein Win's family has not been allowed to visit
him, and AP has received no response to an earlier letter addressed
to then-President Sein Lwin.
   Burma has been in turmoil since September when students rioted
over the voiding of 60 percent of the currency. Bloody rioting,
increasingly focused on political demands, occurred in March and
June and, after a lull, resumed in late July after Sein Lwin
succeeded Ne Win.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says He's Reviewing Meese Order On Special Inquiries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh said
Tuesday he is taking a ``second look'' at the last-minute order of
Edwin Meese III calling for special investigations of members of
Congress suspected of criminal wrongdoing.
   ``I want to find out what the underlying premise was in the
issuance of the order,'' the former Pennsylvania governor said in
one of his first interviews since being sworn in on Aug. 12.
   Thornburgh's comments came as Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman
of a governmental affairs subcommittee, asked the attorney general
to rescind the order because the public didn't have a chance to
comment on it, and it contains a drafting error and other problems.
   Hours before Meese left the attorney general's post on Aug. 12,
he signed the regulation that requires his successors to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing made
against a senator or congressman.
   Meese, who was twice investigated by independent counsels during
his 7{ years as a Reagan administration official, said his order
was designed to ensure that legislators and top executive officials
are treated equitably. The 1978 Ethics in Government Act allows
executive-branch employees to be investigated by special
prosecutors, but not members of Congress.
   Thornburgh, 56, a former head of the Justice Department's
criminal division in the Ford Administration, said it was ``pretty
well known that I see a very limited role for special
prosecutors-independent counsels in the process of investigating
and prosecuting criminal cases.''
   In general, he said that U.S. attorneys and the department's
office of public integrity, which investigates corruption of public
officials, do a fine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct.
Thornburgh, once a prosecutor in Pittsburgh, established the public
integrity office in the mid-1970s.
   ``I guess what I am curious about is what is being proposed ...
a cure where there is no disease'' he said. ``I am taking what
could be called fairly a second look at that order.''
   He said he had no idea when his review might be completed, but
it will include talking to an advisory committee of U.S. attorneys.
   Thornburgh, a friend and supporter of Vice President George
Bush, refused to talk about Bush's selection of Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle as his running mate.
   ``I am really not comfortable talking about issues in the
political realm from this position,'' said Thornburgh, whose name
was bandied about as possible vice presidential candidate before
Bush tapped Quayle.
   Thornburgh said he will not campaign for Bush and has no
commitment that he will remain as attorney general if Bush wins in
November.
   During the next five months, Thornburgh said he will guide the
department by setting high standards for professional conduct and
aggressively pursuing the war on drugs and other criminal activity.
   He has initiated an overall assessment of the department,
evaluating its staff and budgetary needs and looking at which
vacancies need to be filled. ``The responsibility I have to the
president is to take stock and make sure everything is shipshape.''
   Asked how he planned to boost morale at the department after the
Meese era, Thornburgh said, ``You lead by example ... My view of
the department is one that requires an absolute fidelity to high
standards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations.''
   While Meese was attorney general there were widespread
defections among the top ranks at the department; some officials
expressed unhappiness with the attention Meese was forced to give
to his personal troubles.
   James C. McKay, the special prosecutor who investigated Meese,
concluded the then-attorney general probably broke
conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but McKay said he found no basis
to seek criminal charges against Meese. Meese said the report
vindicated him.
   As a result of McKay's report, the department's office of
professional responsiblity, which looks into the conduct of Justice
employees, started a review of Meese's conduct to see if it met
ethical standards. Thornburgh said he had no idea when that report
would be completed.

<HEAD>Records Show Quayle Scored Below Average On Journalism Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle, a member of an influential Indiana
publishing family, scored below average on journalism tests he took
after working more than four years as a National Guard public
affairs official, military records showed Tuesday.
   The Republican vice presidential candidate's 47-page military
record neither spells out how Quayle joined the Indiana National
Guard nor answers questions raised about whether he used family
influence to join the guard and avoid the military draft.
   The Indiana senator had promised last week to release the
records, which are mostly routine papers, detailing immunizations
and copies of orders in which Quayle's name is mentioned.
   Quayle entered the guard on May 19, 1969, six days before he
would have become eligible for the draft upon his graduation from
DePauw University.
   He passed a standard armed forces physical on April 9, 1969, and
took an aptitude test a month later, on May 8, the records show.
   During his six years in the guard, Quayle spent most of his time
with the 120th Public Information Detachment, the records show. The
bulk of his service in the 120th was as a clerk-typist, although he
also was rated as a senior information specialist.
   Quayle also was trained as a welder, although he did not perform
that task in the service.
   The records include a July 25, 1975, evaluation of Quayle as a
public information specialist. Quayle left the service on May 18,
1975.
   On a written test, Quayle scored a total of 56 points, or 19
points below the average score of 75, the records show.
   The written test included questions on seven military journalism
categories. Quayle scored ``low'' in five of the seven and
``average'' in the other two. There were five possible scores,
ranging from ``very low'' and ``low'' through ``average,''
``high,'' and ``very high.''
   The written test was one of three parts of the evaluation of
Quayle's service as a public affairs specialist.
   The records do not detail the scores on the other two sections,
but they do indicate that Quayle's overall rating was an 82. There
was no explanation for the missing scores, nor was there an
indication of how the 82 figure compared with scores for other
guard members.
   In taking the oath of office, Quayle signed a standard military
form saying that he had never been a member of the Communist Party
of any foreign nation. Quayle is now one of the Senate's more
conservative members.

<HEAD>Scarsdale Diet Doctor Killer Now Eligible For Clemency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEDFORD HILLS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jean Harris became eligible for
executive clemency Tuesday, 7{ years after she went to prison for
the murder of the developer of the Scarsdale Diet, Dr. Herman
Tarnower.
   Mrs. Harris, 65, who recently wrote a book on her experiences at
the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, will ask Gov. Mario Cuomo
to grant clemency because of her age, poor health including two
heart attacks in prison, and good prison record, according to her
attorney, Michael Kennedy.
   State law requires an inmate to serve half the minimum prison
term before becoming eligible for executive clemency, an act that
commutes a sentence and allows an inmate to become eligible for
parole.
   Final release must be granted by the State Parole Board.
   Mrs. Harris, a former girls school headmistress, was sentenced
to 15 years to life.
   She was convicted of second-degree murder for the shooting of
Tarnower in the cardiologist's home in Purchase on March 10, 1980.
While she has always contended that Tarnower died as a result of
her own suicide attempt, prosecutors contended Mrs. Harris shot her
lover of 14 years during a jealous rage over a romance with a
younger woman.
   Anne Lennox, who heads a group fighting for Mrs. Harris'
freedom, has said the group is seeking to give the governor
petitions bearing 10,000 signatures to show support for clemency.
   Two years ago, Mrs. Harris sought a waiver of the minimum time
requirement to seek clemency. The governor's Executive Clemency
Board denied the request.
   Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Cuomo, said Mrs. Harris'
application would be reviewed as are all requests.
   Authorities will seek comment from the sentencing judge and the
Westchester County district attorney's office, as well as the head
of Bedford Hills.
   Russell Leggett, who presided over the trial and has since
retired to private practice, has gone on record favoring clemency.
The district attorney's office has not commented.
   Ms. Crowley said it was possible the review of Mrs. Harris'
petition may not be completed by the Christmas season, when Cuomo
usually grants clemencies.

   Despite South Carolina claims, New York
City Mayor Ed Koch isn't convinced the ``Big Apple'' nickname was
picked in Columbia.
   Koch is willing to concede a dance called the Big Apple came
from Columbia, but he insists New York City's nickname was
home-grown.
   ``Big Apple,'' says Koch, was musicians' slang that came from
jazz circles in Harlem. Columbia Mayor T. Patton Adams claims the
name came from the ``Big Apple'' dance performed 50 years ago at a
nightclub of the same name in his city.
   Koch has bet a pizza; Adams is offering mustard-based barbecue
in a wager over the origin of the nickname.
   ``We're not disputing the story about the Big Apple dance. Does
it link up with the nickname? We're not sure,'' Koch spokesman
Larry Simonberg said Monday. ``If these people want to come up with
their evidence, we'd be glad to have them.
   ``Barbecue would be most welcome,'' Simonberg added. ``But we'd
rather have a couple of hitters for the Mets and just to be fair,
some pitchers for the Yankees.''
   The bet was sparked by a New York Times article Monday about the
Columbia claim.
   Adams believes he has a leg up. Documentation. Lots of it.
   The evidence, he says, includes newspaper and magazine articles,
photographs, oral histories of those who lived during the
Depression era _ including people who danced at the Columbia club
and those who danced the step on the stage of New York's Roxy
Theatre in 1937.

   Kansas may not have towering mountains,
but it isn't all flat. It now has a sinkhole that is fast becoming
a tourist attraction.
   It's also a menance, say officials of the state's Kansas
Corporation Commission. They warned people Monday to stay away from
the sinkhole so they don't fall in.
   The sinkhole in southwest Kansas is 300 feet across, 50 feet
deep and promises to get bigger.
   Since it was discovered July 21, six miles northeast of
Macksville, a steady line of lookers has streamed to the site.
People have crawled through the barbed wire to get a better view,
said Bruce Ney, a commission spokesman in Topeka.
   ``It's quite an attraction, unfortunately,'' Ney said.
   Corporation commission geologists estimate the sinkhole could
expand until its diameter reaches 800 feet. Geologists think it was
created when water from a leaking disposal well dissolved salt in a
formation 1,400 feet to 1,750 feet below ground.
   They say the roof of the cavern probably has been collapsing for
a number of years and the disintegration has now reched the surface.

   After a brief exposure, a nearly nude
billboard character is back with a change of clothes.
   Now there can be little doubt that the character, criticized by
some for appearing to be nude, is covered up. In a new sign
unveiled Monday, the man wears a bright red bikini bathing suit.
   ``The guy had a bathing suit before but it was hard to see,''
said Don Pierce, manager of Naegle Outdoor Advertising Co. in
Raleigh.
   Pierce said the company, which owns the three billboards in
Greenville on which the ad appeared, decided to change the sign
after talking with the advertiser and the advertising agency that
developed it.
   The original ads for the Carpet Bargain Center had the face of
an area television announcer imposed on a reclining body that was
clad in flesh-colored briefs.
   Greenville officials said they received about a dozen complaints
from people who thought the man was in the buff. But city officials
said the sign did not violate zoning ordinances or obscenity laws.
   Jeff French, a spokesman for the French Advertising Agency that
prepared the billboard, said Monday the billboards were done with
humor in mind and the advertisers didn't intend for it to be
controversial.

   Farmers have developed conservation plans for
protecting 54 million acres of highly erodible cropland, about 38
percent of the 143 million acres targeted for planning by the 1985
farm law, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the Soil Conservation Service, said
plans have actually been put into effect on 17 million acres, or
about 12 percent of the affected land.
   Under the 1985 law, farmers who raise crops on highly erodible
land must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989, and
implement it fully by Dec. 31, 1994, to remain eligible for USDA
program benefits.
   ``We are on target for meeting the 1989 deadline,'' Scaling
said. ``We hope to have 65 percent of the plans completed by the
end of 1988 and the remaining 35 percent completed by end of 1989.''
   However, Scaling cautioned farmers not to wait until the last
minute to request technical assistance from SCS because they might

   Some of Indiana's produce that survived
the drought may rot in the fields because of a shortage of migrant
workers, a state official said Tuesday.
   Eldon Smith and his son, Scott, said the drought has delayed the
crops at their Sharp-View Farms Inc. by a few weeks, but their 300
acres of tomatoes and 80 acres of cucumbers have had a strong
finish.
   ``It's as good as any year we've ever had. We just don't have
the labor,'' said Scott Smith.
   In a normal year, the two crops are staggered so the harvest is
spread over several weeks. This year's dry conditions, however,
forced the Smiths to plant the tomatoes later than usual, so the
crops have come in at the same time.
   Michelle Moscato, who heads the migrant services division of the
state Department of Human Services, said the same problem is
generating demand for more labor throughout the state at a time
when migrant workers are relatively scarce.
   Ms. Moscato said the number of migrant workers who came to
Indiana this summer is up 10 percent to 15 percent to 3,800 to
4,000.
   ``But people are not staying because the work is not good,'' she
said.
   This week, the Smiths employed 40 migrant workers, compared with
the 80 usually hired at this time. The farm could use 120 workers
this year, so the 40 who are there must work sunrise to sunset,
seven days a week, the elder Smith said.
   ``People are working long hours and are making $30 to $40 a
week. The tomatoes are very small and it's taking two or three
times as long to fill a basket,'' Ms. Moscato said.
   While cucumber harvesters usually are paid an hourly rate,
tomato pickers are paid 28 cents to 35 cents a bushel basket,
compared with at least 35 cents last year.

   Seven senior members of the House Armed
Services Committee said Tuesday the Pentagon should add a clause to
future defense contracts to ensure that any illegally gained
profits can be recovered by the government.
   ``There is an urgent need to protect both the national security
and the interests of the U.S. taxpayer in defense procurement,''
they said in a statement.
   ``A clause in all future contracts allowing the Defense
Department to recover the profit from illegally obtained contracts
would go a long way toward doing that,'' it said.
   The statement arises from the current Pentagon bribery
investigation, which involves allegations that private consultants
illegally bought information about future contracts from Defense
Department employees. No charges have been filed in the case, which
became public June 14.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other top Pentagon
officials have said that if any of the contracts involved in the
investigation turned out to have been won on the basis of illegal
information, the Pentagon can use existing laws to recover the
profits.
   Carlucci last month ordered that a new clause be inserted into
some contracts with firms involved in the investigation.
   The clause should be put into all contracts, the statement said.
   ``Without such protection, the government is not in a position
to feel comfortable entering into future contracts'' with any of
the defense firms mentioned in the investigation, the statement
said.
   The clause could replace some of the legions of auditors who now
check contracts, said Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking
Republican on the panel.
   ``We've got so many regulations now it takes two men to buy an
aspirin tablet, one to fill out the papers and one to audit them,''
he said. ``By the time they're finished, they've both got a new
headache.''
   The letter was signed by Dickinson and Reps. Larry Hopkins,
D-Ky.; John Kasich, R-Ohio; Jim Courter, R-N.J.; Bill Nichols,
D-Ala.; Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; and Les Aspin, D-Wis.

   Offices were emptied, businesses closed and
commuters were stalled Tuesday when officials cut power to part of
downtown Boston for two hours following an electrical fire
triggered by a crew searching for an underground gas leak.
   A Boston Edison Co. spokesman said 12,500 residential and
business customers lost electricity after the Fire Department
ordered power cut around 9:20 a.m. to battle a fire that spewed
flames and thick black smoke from a manhole in the Back Bay section
of Boston.
   The outage affected parts of the city's central shopping area
and several major hotels.
   Firefighter Bill Murphy said a crew contracted by Boston Gas Co.
accidently cut Edison's cables with a backhoe, causing a short
circuit that sparked the fire.
   The fire burned for 35 minutes and caused $50,000 of damage to
Edison's cables before firefighters extinguished the flames with
two foam-spraying trucks and more than 1,000 pounds of dry powder,
Murphy said.
   ``It cut us off before we opened. We just worked in the dark and
shelved books,'' said Beth Wong, an employee at B. Dalton
Bookseller.
   Several people were trapped briefly in elevators at the 52-story
Prudential office tower. Offices in the building were closed and
workers were told to evacuate.
   At the Top of the Hub restaurant, on the building's top floor, a
normally busy pre-lunch time was very quiet, but some employees
decided to stay. ``All I know is I'm not walking down 52 stories,''
said Leslie Dempsey.
   About 300 delegates to a Ford Motor Co. convention were
evacuated from the Massachusetts Convention Center, said Ernest
Lucci, director of marketing.
   A back-up generator and a skylight kept the Neiman Marcus store
in the posh Copley Place shopping mall bright, but cash registers
remained still.
   The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority evacuated and
closed five darkened subway stations, but trains continued.
   Police stationed extra motorcycle policemen in the area to
direct traffic after signal lights went dark, spokeswoman Jill
Reilly said.
   Power was restored after about two hours to all but 23 buildings
near the fire. Edison spokesman Bill Connoly said officials did not
know when the remaining customers would receive electricity.

   President Reagan wooed blue-collar and
conservative votes for Vice President George Bush on Tuesday,
signing a landmark trade bill and deriding the Democratic
presidential ticket as ``third-stringers'' playing a ``curveball
campaign.''
   In two Southern California appearances _ a bill signing ceremony
on a pier in Long Beach and a GOP fundraiser in conservative Orange
County _ the president touted the economic advances of his term and
proclaimed Bush the man to carry his legacy forward.
   He did not mention the record $170 billion trade deficit in 1987
that helped propel this version of the measure through Congress,
nor its primary sponsor, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who is paired
with Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis against Bush
and Quayle.
   ``We're here to sign a piece of legislation that will help our
economy continue to grow and compete,'' Reagan told hundreds of
dock workers and politicians as he spoke before a huge container
ship in Long Beach, one of the world's 10 busiest computerized
cargo ports.
   The bill he signed _ so thick he joked he couldn't pick it up _
is seen as a landmark bipartisan attempt to deal with the nation's
trade woes.
   The signing climaxed months of negotiations between the
administration and Congress over the bill, which Reagan vetoed when
it was first sent to him because it contained a provision requiring
60-day notice to employees of plant closings and layoffs.
   Congress, however, then passed the advance notice provision as a
separate bill, and the president _ at Bush's urging and trying to
minimize its importance as a Democratic election-year issue _ then
let it become law without his signature.
   Bentsen, touring a St. Louis clothing factory, said Reagan had
to be dragged ``kicking and screaming'' into signing the trade
bill. ``The president could have signed that bill many months
ago,'' when it contained the plant-closing provision, said Bentsen,
who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   While Reagan has said the revised bill ``more closely reflects''
his and Bush's open trade views, he noted there are things he
doesn't like about the bill, such as its call for import fees and a
requirement that the executive branch negotiate with foreign
countries on specific trade topics.
   ``Our administration and Congress have come together in an
effort to ensure open markets around the world,'' Reagan said.
``This bill is just the latest step in that effort, which began the
first day George Bush and I entered office and has already opened
vast markets to American products all around the globe.''
   Reagan pointed out the bill will ``provide up to a billion
dollars a year for retraining workers to adjust to our
turbo-charged economy _ an economy that, with the right leader,
will remain'' vibrant.
   The bill is designed to battle the trade deficit by streamlining
machinery for imposing import curbs, which would retaliate against
international trade violations.
   It expands job training for workers left unemployed by import
competition and strengthens the administration's hand in the
current round of world trade talks. It also repeals the windfall
profits tax on oil and imposes sanctions against two foreign
companies linked to sale of submarine-silencing equipment to the
Soviet Union.
   In remarks at a $500-a plate luncheon in Irvine to boost the
re-election campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., Reagan held to
his theme of crediting Bush with helping paint the economy's rosy
glow.
   ``Vice President Bush and I ... have given America the longest
peacetime expansion on record, the country has created over 17.5
million new jobs, inflation is low and employment is at an all time
high,'' he told the 800 to 900 Republican loyalists.
   ``If our opponents are elected this era of record prosperity
will be over _ But I've got news for the liberals: it's not going
to happen,'' he said.
   ``America is not going to trade away our winning team for
third-stringers with a weak defense, a foreign policy of errors,
curveball campaign promises, a set of policies to be named later,
and billions of dollars in higher taxes,'' the president said.
   Dukakis struck back at a news conference in Beverly, Mass. ``I
think it will be the American people who decide who belongs in the
major leagues and who belongs in the bush leagues,'' he said. ``I
think it's Dukakis and Bentsen who belong in the major leagues.''
   Urging the re-election of Wilson, who faces a challenge from
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, Reagan said he sees ``a real
chance that Pete may be part of a Republican majority in the
Senate.''
   ``And wouldn't that be a nice gift for President George Bush and
Vice President Dan Quayle?'' he asked.
   In Long Beach, Reagan offered a strong rebuttal to suggestions
that Bush should jettison Quayle, a senator from Indiana who is
enmeshed in controversy over his military and scholastic records.
   ``No, he's a fine man and well-qualified,'' he retorted when
queried about Quayle's situation.

   The Indiana National Guard was below its
authorized strength when Dan Quayle signed up in May 1969,
officials said Tuesday. Even so, a retired Guard officer said he
directed subordinates to hold an opening for Quayle.
   Maj. Gen. Alfred Ahner said Tuesday he handled a call from a
family employee who recommended Quayle and then he contacted the
Guard personnel office. ``They said they had a couple of spaces,''
Ahner told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ``I said hold one of
them, there's a good guy coming over.''
   Ahner also said in an interview with WTHR-TV, ``I couldn't have
done a thing ... if there hadn't been a vacancy.''
   The issue of whether Quayle used family influence to gain
admittance to the Guard, thus avoiding a likely draft summons at
the height of the Vietnam War, has dogged Quayle since he was named
last week to the Republican presidential ticket.
   A 1969 Guard report circulating here indicated that the Indiana
Guard was overextended in mid-1969, but a month-by-month breakdown
made available on Tuesday showed that Quayle's specific unit had
legitimate openings when he joined up in May, and in the months
before and after.
   Capt. Cathi Kiger said Quayle's Guard unit had an authorized
strength of 138 people in May 1969. According to Guard records, 134
men were in the unit at the end of April, 132 were serving in May _
when Quayle joined _ and 133 men were enlisted in June.
   The Pentagon in Washington further said that Quayle's public
information unit of the Guard _ authorized for a staff of five _
had three individuals assigned to it before Quayle and another man
brought it to full strength in January 1970.
   The figures were made available after publication of the 1969
report from Brig. Gen. John N. Owens, then adjutant general of the
Guard, which put the Guard's assigned strength on June 30, 1969, at
10,255 _ 52 more than its authorized strength of 10,203.
   ``Due to some overstrength, recruiting has been authorized on a
limited basis since 1 April 1969, however, it is anticipated that
large scale recruiting will be conducted to replace approximately
2,500 individuals by the end of (current year) 1969,'' the Owens
report said.
   ``I can find no evidence that he was given special consideration
and there was no need,'' Kiger said of Quayle's Guard service.
``Units that were not up to 100 percent strength could continue to
recruit.''
   Retired Col. Jerome Rafferty, director of personnel for Owens in
1969, said, ``That would mean that if you have a well qualified man
like Dan Quayle, that would be exceptional. You can always get
cooks and drivers. They're a lot easier to get than doctors and
lawyers.''
   Quayle was not an attorney when he applied for the Guard. In
fact, had he not gained admission to the Guard, he likely would
have been drafted into Vietnam war service.
   ``The unit Senator Quayle served in was a specialized unit,''
Rafferty said. ``He could have been recruited very simply for the
fact that he got a college degree, was in law school and had a
newspaper background.''
   The public information unit produced press releases and a
quarterly magazine, The Indiana National Guardsman.
   Rafferty said the then-22-year-old Quayle's background _ he is
an heir of the Pulliam newspaper family _ made him a good candidate
for the Guard, but said his personnel staff also welcomed
recommendations from high-ranking officers.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi, who was managing editor
of the family's Indianapolis News, has said he made one call on
Quayle's behalf.
   ``If General Phillippi or any of the generals called me and said
they knew a man who would make a good Guardsman, I'd prick my
ears,'' said Rafferty, ``because they only sent the highest quality
young man. That's the way the system worked.''
   Phillippi contacted retired Maj. Gen. Ahner, who said Tuesday:
   ``Wendell Phillipp had called and said he had a good man, and
said he thought he'd make a good Guardsman. That's when I went over
to personnel ... I asked if they had any spaces for a good man.
   ``They said they had a couple of spaces. I said hold one of
them, there's a good guy coming over.''
   Rafferty said it was degrading to allege that Quayle used family
connections to secure a spot with the Guard as a means to avoid the
draft.
   ``Why degrade a man who, because he went to college, was smart
enough to do the best thing?'' Rafferty asked. ``He wanted to
finish his law career. I'd have done the same thing.''

   Terrorist attacks within U.S. borders remain few
and far between, but Americans are targeted in one-quarter of all
such attacks worldwide, law enforcement experts said Tuesday.
   ``On a global scale, terrorism continues to grow, and it
continues to plague several nations,,'' said Donald Lavey, an FBI
agent who heads the anti-terrorist squad for Interpol, the
international police agency.
   ``Though this is not the case within the territorial confines of
the United States, Americans remain prominent targets,'' he said,
``and authorities have their work cut out for them.''
   Lavey was among the speakers at a three-day international
conference of law enforcement officials titled ``Terrorism in the
Decade Ahead.'' The meeting, which began Monday, was sponsored by
the University of Illinois-Chicago's Office of International
Criminal Justice.
   Anti-terrorism experts and law enforcement officials from a
dozen nations attended to compare notes, techniques and tactics for
combating terrorism.
   Lavey said terrorist groups are increasingly better financed,
better equipped and more sophisticated than in the past. But
attacking targets on U.S. soil provides more of a logistical
challenge than almost anywhere else in the world.
   ``Even though this is 1988, the oceans still provide a
formidable obstacle,'' he said.
   ``Terrorists view Europe as much more vulnerable because it
provides ... great freedom to travel between one country and
another,'' he noted. ``It's much easier to get lost.
   ``By the same token, U.S. citizens seem to stand out wherever
they travel,'' Lavey said. ``And the terrorists know the easiest
way to get publicity for their causes are to attack Americans.
That's why 25 percent of all attacks are directed against us.''
   William Dyson, the supervising special agent in charge of the
FBI's anti-terrorist squad in Chicago, argued that the U.S. law
enforcement community's reputation is well-deserved and backed up
by its record.
   ``Throughout the late '60s and early '70s, plenty of U.S.
agencies didn't know what they were doing in relation to
terrorism,'' Dyson said. ``The Weather Underground (a radical
student group) alone was responsible for 385 terrorist incidents
and do you know how many were solved? Not one.
   ``And plenty of people got a chance at them ... they were equal
opportunity bombers. They went all over the country.''
   But Dyson said the agency made domestic terrorism a national
priority in 1981, after the capture of former underground radical
Kathy Boudin following a deadly armored-car heist in upstate New
York.
   ``There were elements of the Black Liberation Army involved, the
(Puerto Rican independence group) FALN and some other Weather
Underground people,'' he said. ``It was an indication of how much
of a network existed between groups that we once considered
essentially separate.
   ``What we learned is that we needed a network of law enforcement
agencies to deal with the problem,'' he said. ``The New York
terrorism task force, which brought federal, state and local
authorities in a cooperative effort, came out of that and it's been
a successful model.''
   Dyson said the success of such programs can be measured by the
range of terrorist organizations that have been rendered
ineffectual in recent years _ from the white supremacist Aryan
Nations, which once staged armed robberies to finance its attacks
against black and Jewish targets, to the conviction of members of
the El Rukns, a powerful black Chicago street gang, on charges of
conspiring to carry out bombings on behalf of Libya.
   ``I don't know how long it may be before a terrorist attack
(inside the United States) happens,'' he said. ``It may never
happen. But as long as terrorists know they can get the world's
attention, it would be dangerous to let our guard down.''

   A federal judge has dismissed a $25 million
antitrust lawsuit against MCA Records and the Warner Communications
labels brought by a record promoter under scrutiny in a nationwide
payola investigation.
   During a five-minute hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge
Consuelo B. Marshall decided to dismiss the suit, reversing a
decision she made in June.
   Marshall said that after reviewing MCA's and Warner's motion for
dismissal, she decided her previous ruling was incorrect.
   The 2-year-old action was filed by independent record promoter
Joseph Isgro, who accused MCA, Warner and 10 other record companies
of conspiring to boycott his services.
   All the other record companies settled out of court.
   Attorneys Steven Cannata and Lawrence Papale, representing
Isgro, were very surprised by the judge's decision.
   ``It was the same motion, word for word, that she already
denied,'' Cannata said. Papale said the ruling would probably be
appealed.
   ``MCA continues to deny there was conspiracy in the first
place,'' said Brad Phillips, a lawyer with the firm representing
MCA. He contended that Isgro could not have proven that there was
an antitrust violation.
   MCA is still suing Isgro, claiming civil racketeering against
the promoter. The judge, on Monday, dismissed a similar complaint
filed by Warner, saying Warner's complaint against Isgro was not
specific enough. Warner, however, has 30 days to amend its
complaint.
   Isgro drew attention in the payola scandal in 1986 when NBC News
portrayed him as being associated with organized crime. After the
telecast, all major record companies announced they would suspend
use of independent promoters.
   Isgro has denied any connection with payola practices, but he is
the focus of a federal grand jury probe. His former business
associates, Ralph Tashjian and Bill Craig, were indicted in January
of several payola and tax evasion charges.

   Some workers ended their strikes Tuesday,
but 125 miners barricaded themselves in an underground shaft and
vowed to stay until they won higher pay and recognition of the
banned Solidarity trade union.
   The government said it wouldn't negotiate ``under the `pistol'
of a strike,'' and took measures to end Poland's worst wave of
labor unrest since the 1981 imposition of martial law.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said at least 49 people have
been detained by police nationwide in connection with the strikes,
which began Aug. 16 and at their height affected about 100,000
workers at 20 sites.
   On Monday night, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said troops
would be sent to secure major industrial plants to prevent anarchy,
although none were in evidence at the plants Tuesday. An 11 p.m. to
5 a.m. curfew was imposed in Jastrzebie in Katowice Province, the
site of many of the mine strikes.
   Four columns of army and police vehicles left Krakow for
Katowice, witnesses said. Two of the convoys consisted of more than
70 vehicles, including four trucks with water cannons and 10
truckloads of armed soldiers, the witnesses said.
   On the road in Oswiecim, near the entrance to the coal-rich
Silesia region, army roadblocks stopped cars and searched them.
   Miners from the 30 Years of People's Poland Mine near Jastrzebie
pledged they ``will stay there until the end of their lives, until
all the demands are met,'' said Wojciech Maziarski, a Solidarity
spokesman in Warsaw.
   Striking dockworkers in Szczecin said they feared police were
getting ready to move in on them Tuesday night. Police broke up
strikes at two Szczecin streetcar depots and one bus depot on
Monday night.
   ``The situation here is very simple now: we are expecting an
assault at any moment, because movements of police vehicles have
been spotted outside our perimeter,'' said Edward Rodziewicz,
chairman of the Interfactory Strike Committee at the Baltic port.
   At the 30 Years of People's Poland mine, workers went down into
the shaft, 580 yards underground, about noon Tuesday, according to
the Inter-mine Strike Committee in Jastrzebie.
   ``They have decided to stay underground until the start of
negotiations,'' said a communique issued by the committee. ``Their
health is in danger.''
   Mine strike leaders said they were not discouraged by the
government actions and would continue their strike.
   ``We have to continue to fight the red bourgeoisie in the
party,'' said Romuald Bozko, a worker at the Moszczenice mine who
was interviewed at a church in Jastrzebie.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appealed again for dialogue with
authorities to end the strikes, but Urban dismissed the possibility
of negotiations while strikes continued.
   ``There will be no political talks under the `pistol' of a
strike,'' Urban told a Warsaw news conference. The strikers have
been demanding increased wages and recognition of Solidarity, which
was outlawed in 1981.
   Urban announced that a special parliament commission will meet
Aug. 31 to review the government's economic policies and that it
might make adjustments in its economic program after consultation
with official trade unions.
   He declined to explain what steps the security forces mentioned
by Kiszczak would take at the strikebound plants. Kiszczak also
said curfews were authorized in the provinces of Szczecin, Katowice
and Gdansk, although the only place where one was imposed was in
the Katowice town of Jastrzebie.
   Urban did not rule out declaring a state of emergency in the
affected provinces.
   ``The measures that will be applied will be adequate to
developments,'' Urban said.
   The government said only a few thousand workers remained on
strike. The number could not be independently verified.
   The Politburo of the country's ruling Polish United Workers
(Communist) Party met on the situation Tuesday night, state
television reported, but there were no details on its deliberation.
   On Monday, workers at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk waved Polish
flags and changed ``Solidarity!'' in scenes reminiscent of a
nine-day strike there in May.
   Strikes were reported at two more Silesian coal mines Tuesday,
bringing to 11 the number hit by labor unrest. Solidarity activists
said strike actions spread to a repair shipyard and a shipyard
making boats for river traffic in Gdansk.
   ``These are events of great importance,'' said Solidarity
adviser Adam Michnik, because they followed Kiszczak's speech
Monday.
   ``If the intention of the speech was to stop the just protest of
the workers by intimidating them, then this scenario has failed,''
Michnik said.
   But there were signs that enthusiasm for strikes was ebbing
elsewhere.
   Strikers in two departments of the Cegielski Engine Works in
Poznan ended a walkout Tuesday, as well as those at a train car
factory in Wroclaw, the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw, and the
Andaluzja coal mine, according to the state-run news agency PAP.
   An attempt to begin a strike in one department of the Nowa Huta
steelworks outside Krakow fizzled after a few hours.
   Miners in Jastrzebie, the heart of the miners' unrest, reported
a harrowing few hours before dawn Tuesday, saying police cars with
sirens blaring drove up to the July Manifest Mine in a mock raid.
   Strikers could be seen erecting barricades by using wood to
reinforce the mine's entrance gates in preparation for possible
police assault.
   Provincial governors in Wroclaw, Warsaw, Katowice and Szczecin
issued regulations for speeded-up court proceedings against strike
leaders, according to reports in the official press.
   Kiszczak, in his TV address, had urged that glaring offenders
against the peace be jailed in summary proceedings, not just fined.

<HEAD>Cattle Fattened For Slaughter Bringing Higher Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle fattened for the slaughter market are
bringing higher prices this month, reflecting fewer animals and a
strong consumer demand for beef, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   In all, cattle slaughter in August may rise only 8 percent from
July, the department's Economic Research Service said in an updated
review of the livestock and poultry situation.
   Officials gave the 8 percent forecast even though August has two
more working days at plants than July, which raised speculation
that cattle slaughter might rise by as much as 10 percent this
month.
   ``Cow slaughter has begun picking up,'' the report said.
``However, this appears to be a seasonal movement of beef cows off
grass (pasture) rather than a forced drought movement.''
   There had been an increase in cow slaughter earlier this summer
as some producers in the drought-stricken Northern Plains and in
the Lakes states were forced to send beef and dairy cows to market
because of feed shortages.
   In many cases, however, breeding animals have been purchased by
producers in other areas where feed is available, thus forestalling
massive sell-offs of herds.
   According to federal inspection reports, the slaughter of beef
cows this year through the first week in August totaled about 1.89
million head, down 9 percent from the same period in 1987. Dairy
cow slaughter, at 1.66 million head, dropped 3 percent.
   Prices of fed cattle in the southern Great Plains are selling
for more than $70 per 100 pounds of live weight in late August, up
from $66 in July, the report said.
   Beef from cows goes mainly into hamburger and processing, while
grain-fed steers and heifers provide the higher-grade cuts found in
supermarkets.
   Looking at pork, the report said weekly slaughter is expected to
increase sharply in September, pushing prices down.
   Meanwhile, hot weather has disrupted marketings and slowed
weight gains of hogs. That has lent some support to ``an otherwise
weak market'' this summer, the report said.
   Wholesale prices of dressed broiler chickens in early August
remained around 70 cents a pound, well above the 53 cents of a year
earlier. Prices should average around 61 to 65 cents a pound during
the third quarter, the report said.

<HEAD>Navy Officer Killed By Bomb; British Military Adopts New License
Plates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IRA guerrillas killed another
British military officer and London announced Tuesday it is
changing license plates for the cars of Britiah servicemen in West
Germany.
   Lt. Alan Shields, 45, a navy recruiting officer, was driving
into East Belfast Monday night when a bomb attached to his car blew
up, police reported.
   His death came three days after an IRA bomb killed eight
soldiers in a bus in Northern Ireland. Shields was the 26th British
serviceman killed this year in IRA attacks, compared with three in
1987.
   The Defense Department announced in London that the distinctive
military plates used on the 95,000 vehicles of British military
personnel and their families in West Germany would be replaced by
standard British license plates.
   Four British military personnel were killed in Western Europe
this summer by bombs and automatic rifle fire. The IRA claimed
responsibility for the attacks that involved cars carrying military
license plates.
   Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton said the license-late
change will make the cars of military personnel indistinguishable
from those of British tourists.
   Shields, whose wife and son live in Scotland, was believed to be
the first Royal Navy man killed by the IRA in Northern Ireland.
   Crispin Rodwell, a news photographer who was driving behind
Shields' car, said, ``It just exploded and was immediately engulfed
in flames. Several people ran forward with fire extinguishers ...
but couldn't get close enough to have any effect and the driver was
still inside.''
   The blast occurred near the Roman Catholic Short Strand area, a
stronghold of Irish Republican Army. The Guardian newspaper in
London said some Short Strand residents jeered as the car burned.
   The outlawed IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing in a
telephoned message to a local radio station, saying it had killed a
British soldier.
   But a press officer at police headquarters in Belfast said
Shields was a Royal Navy recruiting officer who worked at the
recruiting office in Belfast.
   The IRA circulated a statement Tuesday saying Shields ``was
engaged in recruiting personnel to carry on Britain's war in
Ireland.''
   It added: ``Our volunteers had been observing their target and a
number of others based at the same location for some time.
Yesterday when the opportunity presented itself a 3-pound charge of
high explosives was placed on the vehicle.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office in London said she was
``saddened and angered by yet another senseless killing.''
   Mrs. Thatcher ordered a security review following the IRA bomb
attack Saturday that killed eight soldiers and injured 27.
   The soldiers were in an unmarked military bus returning to their
barracks at Omagh, 50 miles west of Belfast, following leave on the
British mainland when a bomb in a car parked on the roadside
exploded as the bus passed.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Unions Gain In Public Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public approval of labor unions has climbed by
six percentage points since 1981 while disapproval of them has
declined by 10 percent, according to a Gallup Organization poll
released Tuesday.
   The poll, conducted in June through in-depth personal interviews
with 1,029 people in their homes, showed that 61 percent of the
public at large approved of unions while 25 percent disapproved and
14 percent had no opinion.
   In 1986, the last time Gallup asked the same question _ ``Do you
approve or disapprove of labor unions?'' _ 59 percent answered they
approved, 30 percent said they do not approve and 11 percent had no
opinion.
   Public opinion of labor unions as measured by the poll conducted
periodically since 1936 had fallen from 1965 through the 1970s but
began rebounding after 1981, when the approval rate was 55 percent
and the dispproval rate was an all-time high 35 percent.
   ``The trend in the last couple of years has been that it is kind
of inching upwards,'' said John McNee, a Gallup vice president.
   McNee said the poll had a margin of error of 4 percent, meaning
that if every adult in the country had been questioned, the results
could have been 4 percentage points different in either direction.
   Approval of unions is still well below the 63-67 percent range
it was in the middle 1960s and the peak 75-76 percent of the middle
'50s.
   In the latest poll, unions were held in highest esteem _ 67
percent and 68 percent, respectively _ by people aged 18-24 and
45-54. Disapproval was greatest, 32 percent, among 35-year-olds to
44 year-olds.
   Among income groups, those earning $40,000 to $50,000 a year had
the highest approval rate of unions, 66 percent. The highest
disapproval rate, 37 percent, was among those with incomes
exceeding $50,000.
   Unions were most popular among blacks with an approval rate of
74 percent and a disapproval rate of 11 percent; followed by
Hispanics at 71 percent approval and 15 percent disapproval, and
whites at 60 percent approval and 26 percent disapproval.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said the most encouraging aspect
of the poll for a union movement that has lost members every year
this decade is the above-average approval rate among those aged 18
to 24.
   Kirkland said several factors could be behind the turnaround,
including a decrease in strikes in recent years and more extensive
public relations efforts by the labor federation and individual
unions, such as a $13 million television and radio advertising
campaign launched in May.
   ``Strikes are clearly unpopular,'' he said. ``There are elements
of our duties ... that are not joyously received by the public at
large, that sometimes cause inconvenience,'' he said.
   ``But also I think there is a public recognition that the
pendulum has swung too far,'' he said. ``We've had several years
where employers have had the upper hand in many cases and they've
used it brutally ... in unfair treatment of employees who have
given their lives to enterprises.''

<TEXT>
   A limpet mine clamped under a
table at a restaurant in the coastal city of East London exploded
Tuesday, injuring at least 23 people, police said.
   About 10 people were inside the Wimpy restaurant across from
city hall in East London's central business district when the blast
occurred at 1:15 p.m. The injured included diners and passersby,
authorities said.
   Three women were seriously injured from shrapnel wounds and
burns and were hospitalized. The rest, half of them black and the
rest white, were treated for cuts and shock and released, hospital
officials said.
   Maj. Trevor Hayes, spokesman for the East London area police,
said a limpet mine believed to have been planted by the outlawed
African National Congress was attached underneath a table next to a
window facing the street.
   A deep hole was blasted in the floor, tables were ripped out and
the kitchen and interior were destroyed by fire.
   Ference Makovinir, 35, said he was blown through the window by
the blast as he and his wife, Theonie, 28, were having coffee.
   ``I don't know what happened,'' he said. ``I heard this
thunderous noise and saw the flames and the next thing I was thrown
out of the window. I went back into the place to look for my
wife,'' who he said was in shock but unhurt.
   Two other Wimpy restaurants in South Africa have been bombed
since June 1986, and the company announced it would now discuss
increasing its security.
   Police have blamed the ANC for a series of recent bombings in
civilian areas. The ANC said last week that some civilian targets
had been attacked by guerrillas acting against their leaders'
instructions.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the
South African government and end apartheid.

<TEXT>
   Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions
on Tuesday vowed to block presidential elections until Christians
agree to constitutional reforms that would give Lebanon's feuding
communities an equal share of power.
   ``Nationalist and progressive forces will undertake all poitical
and active measures to prevent elections until achieving national
entente,'' said a joint statement issued by 12 factions.
   The factions included the prominent Shiite Moslem Amal militia
of Justice Minister Nabih Berri and the Progressive Socialist Party
of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt.
   The six-year term of President Amin Gemayel, a Maronite
Catholic, expires Sept. 23, and under the constitution, parliament
must elect a new president by mid-September.
   Planned elections in the 99-seat parliament were blocked last
Thursday when most Christian deputies boycotted the session to
protest the candidiacy of former President Suleiman Franjieh.
   Franjieh, 78, a staunch ally of Syria, was president when the
civil war broke out in April 1975. Before his term ended in 1976,
he requested Syrian military intervention to end the fighting.
   There are only 76 active members of parliament. The house was
elected in 1972 for a four-year term, but but its mandate was
renewed several times because civil strife prevented elections.
   The Lebanese Forces militia, the Christians' main military arm,
is pro-Israeli and violently opposed to Syria, which maintians
40,000 troops in east and north Lebanon and Moslem west Beirut.
   Israel maintians a self-proclaimed ``security zone'' six to 10
miles into southern Lebanon.
   Under an unwritten national covenant made after Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, Christians have maintained the
top executive, legislative, judicial and military posts.
   The president is traditionally elected from the Maronite
Catholic community.
   In the absence of elections, the outgoing president could form a
caretaker Cabinet under a Maronite prime minister.
   But the statement on Tuesday vowed to fight with ``political and
material'' means any such attempt by Gemayel. It did not elaborate
or say outrightly if that meant the 12 groups plan to rekindle
civil war fighting.
   The statement also called for a nationwide ``warning strike'' on
Friday to protest the ``American-Israeli intervention that
prevented the parliament from practicing its role of electing a new
president.''
   The pro-Syrian militias urged their followers to ``be on maximum
alert to confront the critical situation and to continue the
struggle in order to liberate the country and regain its
sovereignty.''

   An Israeli diplomat returned Tuesday from
Moscow amid speculation that his country and the Soviet Union will
open political talks, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Yaakov Kedmi traveled to the Soviet Union last month as a member
of a delegation whose purpose was to issue visas for Soviet Jews
and inspect the Israeli Embassy building.
   It was the first visit by Israeli diplomats to the Soviet Union
since ties were severed between the two countries 21 years ago over
the 1967 Middle East war. A Soviet delegation has been in Israel
for more than a year.
   Israel radio reported earlier this week that the Israeli team
and their Soviet counterparts in Israel would meet again for
political talks.
   Foreign Ministry officials denied that any political discussions
were planned either in Jerusalem or Moscow.
   The Soviet-born Kedmi, 43, was among the first Soviet Jewish
activists who came here in the late 1960s. Since then, about
200,000 Soviet Jews have come to Israel.

   A lung specialist who visited Nelson Mandela last
weekend in a Cape Town hospital said Tuesday the black African
nationalist leader is in ``excellent'' health after a bout with
non-infectious tuberculosis.
   ``He is in excellent shape and he is in the best possible
hands,'' said Professor Heinrich Herzog. ``He told me, `I was sick
and now I am perfectly well'. He also said all symptoms (of the
disease) had gone.''
   Herzog, a former president of the European Society of
Pneumology, returned Monday night after a three-day stay. He said
he was invited by Mandela's attending physician, Attie de Kock of
Stellenbosch University.
   De Kock, who is treating Mandela in Cape Town's Tygerberg
Hospital, wanted to have a second, ``neutral'' specialist confirm
his diagnosis after unspecified quarters voiced doubt about it, he
said.
   Herzog said an examination of medical records and X-rays left
him ``absolutely without doubt'' that the diagnosis was correct and
that the 70-year-old Mandela had suffered from ``closed or
non-bacillar tuberculosis.'' He said antibiotic therapy worked
``very fast and with perfect results.''
   ``He is really in the best possible hands,'' Herzog said. He
said he knew De Kock as a colleague and a fellow member of the
American College of Chest Physicians and that they both repeatedly
met at international medical congresses.
   He laughed when told some people may suspect his trip was
arranged by the white government for propaganda purposes. ``They
should know that I am an outspoken opponent of apartheid. But I
went there (to see Mandela) because he is a patient. I did not go
there for political reasons,'' Herzog said.
   His observations contrasted with a report by Mandela's lawyer,
Ismail Ayob, who said last week that Mandela had lost much weight,
was short of breath, had a persistent cough and impaired speech.
   ``Mr. Mandela is normally slender,'' Herzog said. ``He did not
cough once when I visited him. Because of the rumors (about his
health) he was extremely grateful for my visit because it provided
him with the final evidence. He could say `Stop now (with the
rumors). You cannot doubt two authorities.'''
   Herzog said Mandela was still in Tygerberg Hospital when he left
South Africa. ``He could leave there soon,'' he said. ``The
question is where to.'' Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said
Tuesday that Pakistan's intelligence services received information
her life was in danger following the plane crash that killed
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   Ms. Bhutto said she was under police protection.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported sectarian strife in northwestern
Pakistan in the wake of Zia's death last week had left at least 10
people dead.
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the country's largest opposition party,
the Pakistan People's Party, said she was informed Tuesday that the
government had posted armed guards outside her home.
   ``They informed me that they had received some threats so they
wanted to post some guards,'' she said in an interview with The
Associated Press at her home. ``They told my secretary, `We used to
follow her for intelligence purposes but now we'll follow her to
guard her.'''
   Ms. Bhutto said she had no other details.
   A civilian intelligence source in his southern port city,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the police guards had been
watching her since Sunday, four days after Zia's C-130 plane
exploded and crashed in eastern Pakistan on Aug. 17.
   Government officials suspect the plane was sabotaged and a team
of U.S. and Pakistani officials are at the crash site investigating.
   Across the street from her walled home near Clifton Beach was
parked an unmarked blue truck, white jeep and motorcycle, all
bearing special government plates. They were manned by members of
an elite unit from the Sind provincial police called the ``Eagle
Squad,'' the intelligence source said.
   Ms. Bhutto in the interview said political leaders must
``conduct themselves in the finest democratic tradition'' and ``act
so as to give the military no pretext for intervention.''
   She said she was seeking to form alliances with other opposition
groups and reach agreements to prevent them competing for the same
national assembly seats.
   Ms. Bhutto strongly criticized the current cabinet, calling the
ministers ``dangerous'' holdovers from Zia's regime. Thirteen of
the 16 ministers were appointed by Zia.
   ``These are people who know they will lose their power, their
privilege, their patronage Nov. 16 and it is they who will do
whatever they can to prevent the holding of fair, free and
impartial elections,'' she said.
   She called on new President Ishaq Khan to dismiss the cabinet
and appoint a caretaker government until elections of ``people who
don't have a vested interest in the elections and will conduct
themselves in a neutral way,'' she said.
   She expressed confidence that if elections were conducted fairly
she would win. She said her government would seek to attract
outside investment, maintain close relations with the United States
and honor commitments to the Afghan Mujahedeen guerrillas.
   Pakistan under Zia was the United States' chief ally in the
region, chanelling U.S. arms and other support to the guerrillas
fighting Soviet and Afghan forces in neighboring Afghanistan.
   Since the assassination three weeks ago of a Shiite Moslem
religious leader in northwestern Pakistan, tension between Shiite
and Sunni Moslems has increased and authorities feared the
observance could lead to violent confrontations. Zia himself was a
Sunni Moslem.
   Troops were in high profile Tuesday, patrolling Karachi and
other Pakistani cities but there were no immediate reports of
violence.
   The English-language newspaper The Muslim reported Tuesday at
least 10 people died and 10 others were injured the last few days
in sectarian violence between minority Shiites and Sunni Moslems
near Kohat, about 100 miles west of Islamabad, the capital.
   At least six of the dead were Shiites from Lodhikhel who were
attacked by Sunni tribesmen, the newspaper reported.
   The violence is the worst reported in Pakistan since Zia's death.

<HEAD>Refugees Begin Protest Against Destruction Of Villages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian refugees and Hungarian
activist groups have begun a two-week protest against the razing of
thousands of villages in Romania, it was reported Tuesday.
   The protesters are demanding that the Romanian government stop
its plan to demolish about 7,000 of Romania's 13,000 villages and
to resettle the population in big ``agro-industrial centers'' by
the year 2000.
   Hungarian radio said the peaceful protest began Monday night
outside the Romanian Embassy in Budapest and was led by the Free
Romania group, which is made up of ethnic Romanians who fled to
Hungary.
   Members of the group went on a 24-hour hunger strike on Tuesday,
the Romanian National Day, the report said.
   The demonstrators were planning to take turns standing in front
of the embassy in shifts of three to six hours, and their numbers
are expected to vary from a few dozen to several hundred people.
   Outlawed Hungarian activist groups also represented in the
protest included the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Fidesz
independent youth group and the Forras Koer (Fountain Circle), the
radio reported.
   The resettlement scheme would affect hundreds of ethnic
Hungarian villages.
   Hungarian Politburo member Imre Pozsgay denounced the project as
a ``crime against mankind.''
   In an editorial, the government newspaper Magyar Hirlap said the
largest ethnic Hungarian group outside Hungary lives in Romania and
that ``it could play the role of bridge between the two countries'
citizens.''
   Critics in Hungary have said the Romanian government is pursuing
a policy of discrimination against the 1.7 million Hungarians in
Romania by destroying village culture as well as the tradition of
Romania's minorities.
   Romania has repeatedly rejected the charges, claiming the
project will raise living standards and win arable land for
agriculture.
   In a related development Tuesday, a Hungarian bishop in charge
of helping Romanian refugees called on the West to bring the
Romanian village-razing plan before the United Nations.
   Bishop Endre Gyula of Szeged, about 10 miles from the Romanian
border, called for economic sanctions against Romania, according to
the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress.
   According to Gyula, 12,000 Romanians have fled to Hungary since
Budapest took the unprecedented step last year of accepting
refugees.
   Gyula said refugees have reported that a number of villages
around Bucharest and in Transylvania already have been destroyed,
Kathpress said.
   The bishop described the situation for refugees on the border as
``dramatic,'' saying people were beaten.

members overflowing a meeting hall in this Detroit suburb. ``He
could have signed that bill months ago, but he vetoed it over the
plant-closing provision.''
   The president vetoed the trade bill earlier this year largely
because of the provision calling for 60 days' notice to workers
before a plant can be closed. He has since let that provision
become law in separate legislation, and he signed the companion
trade bill Tuesday in California.
   The campaign schedule for Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee and a prime sponsor of the trade bill, was
tailored to help him dramatize his point that Reagan had done a
180-degree turn on the legislation because the issue was hurting
Republican presidential nominee George Bush.
   ``I want you to know who the point man was in fighting that
plant-closing provision,'' Bentsen told clothing workers earlier at
the Biltwell Co. in St. Louis.
   ``It was a senator _ Dan Quayle _ who fought against it. But he
lost and the administration lost and we were able to put it into
law,'' he said, referring to the Republican vice presidential
nominee.
   ``I fought for two or three years to put that trade bill in
effect,'' while the president ``put many a roadblock in front,''
Bentsen said.
   The president now ``has waited until the very last day to sign
it, and he's gone to the latest time zone,'' Bentsen said.
   ``He's been carried kicking and screaming to the altar but it
looks like we finally have a marriage and we're finally going to
get a real trade bill for America,'' Bentsen said, receiving hearty
applause from the 100 workers crowded in the plant snack bar to
listen.
   Bush, when Reagan tapped him earlier in the administration to
talk with the Japanese about unfair trade, was ``heaping effusive
praise'' instead of bargaining tough, Bentsen said.
   Bentsen said a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would fight to
open foreign markets. He promised that one of the first pieces of
business before the Senate next month would be a textile trade bill
aimed specifically at the clothing industry, which he said had been
particularly hard hit.
   When Bentsen toured the plant, the workers, mostly women, showed
him how to use various pieces of equipment. He worked a machine
pressing men's suit coats, and his wife B.A. joked that he didn't
do that at home.
   The company gave Bentsen a blue hopsack blazer, size 42 long,
and he was presented with a ``Buy American'' tee shirt and a union
hat.
   Earlier, talking to reporters on the campaign jet, Bentsen
remarked on Reagan's delay in signing the bill and said the
president ``really is a hard loser.''
   Bentsen denied that Reagan's signature on the measure would take
the issue away from the Democrats. ``Not so long as we remember
it's the Bentsen-Danforth bill,'' he said. Sen. John Danforth,
R-Mo., co-sponsored the legislation.
   Bentsen avoided criticizing Quayle over the Republican's entry
in to the National Guard during the Vietnam war. One of Bentsen's
sons also joined the Guard during that time frame.
   ``I think you'll see less intensity on the issue as time goes
on,'' he said. ``I'm not going to trash him on the issue.''
   Bentsen did chide Quayle for his late conversion, which came
Monday night before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in
Chicago, to supporting a bill making the Veterans Administration a
cabinet-level agency. ``That was only a month ago'' that Quayle was
one of few in the Senate to oppose the measure, Bentsen said.

   Refugees fleeing tribal violence in
Burundi claim that the army took part in the slaughter of thousands
of people in that small, central African nation, a U.N. official
said Tuesday.
   At least 5,000 people have been reported killed in massacres
during fightng between two rival tribes.
   Code Cisse, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees'
representative in Rwanda, said about 38,000 refugees have fled
Burundi into neighboring Rwanda since the killing broke out Aug.
14. He said about 5,000 peasants continue to cross the border each
day.
   Most of those fleeing are members of the Hutu tribe, said Cisse,
who spoke in a telephone interview after visiting border areas over
the weekend.
   Although the Hutu make up nearly 85 percent of Burundi's 5
million people, they are subservient to the Tutsi, who comprise the
remaining 15 percent and dominate the government and army.
   ``We saw many people who had been injured by bullets and
bayonets,'' Cisse said ``They said they were fleeing because they
didn't want to get shot by the military.''
   The Hutu People Liberation Party, an exiled opposition group,
also has charged that Burundi's military massacred thousands of the
majority Hutus.
   Burundi's government denied the accusations and said 5,000
people were killed in a slaughter instigated by exiled Hutus who
infiltrated Burundi to inflame anti-Tutsi sentiments.
   ``What the government did was restore peace,'' said a communique
issued Monday by Burundi's foreign minister, Cyprien Mbonimpa.
   The Hutu and the Tutsi are longtime enemies. After an abortive
1972 coup attempt in the former Belgium colony the Tutsi massacred
more than 100,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's educated
class, according to human rights groups.
   Western diplomats in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, say tribal
disturbances took place earlier this month in the northern region,
where last week's slaughter occurred, but that the government
believes it has restored order.
   ``The killing seems to have caught everybody by surprise,'' said
one Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said
the suddenness of the violence ``could lend credence to the
government's claim there had been infiltrators trying to stir
things up.''
   Most killings occurred around the remote farming communes of
Ntega and Marangara in northern Burundi, a hilly, marshy area that
has since been sealed off by the military.
   ``News has been very, very difficult to come by,'' the diplomat
said. ``But from all that we have been able to gather, the army
moved in after the initial mass killing had occurred and was
instructed to fire only upon those carrying arms or threatening
other people.''
   Cisse said Rwanda urgently needed help to cope with the refugee
influx. Immediate requirements were blankets, medicines and tents,
he said, adding that many refugees were sleeping in the open.
   ``The conditions are very bad,'' he said. ``They are located in
a region where there is a high risk of malaria and are being housed
in schools and health clinics. We can't meet the need.''
   Rwanda and Burundi are among the world's most densely populated
countries.
   Nearly 5 million people are crammed into Burundi, which covers
an area about the size of Maryland. About 6 million people live in
slightly smaller Rwanda. There, the Hutu-Tutsi percentages are
roughly the same, although the Hutu dominate the government.
   Burundi promised in its communique Monday to work with those who
fled to Rwanda and to make possible a speedy return home.
   The massacre was the first outbreak of violence since Maj.
Pierre Buyoya seized power in a bloodless coup on Sept. 3, 1987
while former President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza was attending a
Francophone summit in Canada.
   The government has restricted travel between towns, enforced a 7
p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew throughout the country and banned meetings of
more than five people.

<HEAD>CDC Organizes Nationwide Random AIDS Testing Of Newborns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control is
sponsoring a program to randomly test the blood of up to one-third
of the babies born in the United States next year for antibodies to
the AIDS virus.
   The tests will determine only whether the mother is infected. A
positive result does not necessarily mean the child has or will get
AIDS, said Dr. Timothy Dondero, head of the sero-epidemiology
branch of the CDC's AIDS program.
   Although the conclusions of several studies differ, they
indicate that from 30 percent to 50 percent of the newborns testing
positive could eventually get acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
he said in an interview Tuesday.
   Dondero said plans for the infant tests are in place so far in
about 23 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, and
actual testing is under way in about half of those.
   He said he expects participation of about 30 states by the end
of the year and more in 1989. The study is part of a $40 million
package of programs to track the spread of the AIDS virus.
   The virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. The disease has claimed the
lives of nearly 40,000 Americans.
   AIDS is most commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by
sharing contaminated drug needles. It is also spread, less often,
from an infected mother to her child before or at birth.
   It is likely that about 1.3 million infants will be tested next
year, using a method first tried by Massachusetts health officials,
Dondero said. No names will be attatched to the blood samples, he
said.
   ``There is no way of testing specimens linked to individuals
unless you have the consent of the individual,'' he said, adding
that getting consent would hobble the random aspect of the sample.
   ``Most groups involved in testing _ military recruits, sexually
transmitted disease clinics, blood donors _ are to some extent
self-selected,'' he said. ``People do not agree to take part who
have some reason for not wanting to take part.''
   The new program is intended to test a true representative sample
of the population, Dondero said. He said the aim is to determine
where AIDS infection among women is concentrated and to determine
where to target prevention programs.
   ``So far it is concentrated in big cities. It is important to
assess if it is prevalent in some rural areas as well,'' he said.
   ``Over time we will be able to monitor trends of infection in
the female half of the general population,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Says Military Will Not Withdraw From Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FEDERICO QUILODRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet, celebrating
15 years as chief of Chile's army, declared Tuesday that the armed
forces will not withdraw from politics or abandon control of
internal security.
   In addition, the army's vice-commander, Gen. Santiago Sinclair,
said troops were ``in a state of readiness'' for an October
referendum in which the right-wing president is expected to seek
eight more years of rule.
   The 72-year-old Pinochet's impassioned defense of military
involvement in politics appeared intended to counter suggestions
that he should give up his army command in return for the
presidential nomination.
   Pinochet told army officers at a luncheon at the army academy in
east suburban Santiago that Chile faced a constant threat of
Marxist subversion.
   ``It is thus impossible to conceive that the military would be
called upon to intervene only when the cannon roars in an external
conflict,'' he said. ``Each day we are more certain that the
permanent enemies of Western humanity are active within a country's
own borders.''
   Pinochet complained that past governments ``kept the armed
forces apart from national development and public affairs,
relegating them to darkest passivity.''
   He said Chile's new institutional structure ``requires an armed
forces conscious of their political responsibilities.''
   The luncheon was private, but copies of Pinochet's address were
given to reporters by his press secretary.
   Pinochet was named commander of the army, by far the most
powerful military branch, on Aug. 23, 1973, by elected President
Salvador Allende, a self-declared Marxist. Nineteen days later,
Pinochet led the coup that toppled Allende's government. He has
been the country's authoritarian ruler ever since.
   Sinclair told Pinochet in a speech that the military branch was
in ``a state of readiness over future events on which the destiny
of the country depends.''
   Military leaders meet Aug. 30 to select a single presidential
candidate, expected to be Pinochet. Voters then will be asked to
vote yes or no on the candidate during a referendum.
   Sinclair pledged army support for the nominee, saying ``it is
essential that we move forward and continue the work'' of
Pinochet's administration.
   No exact date for the referendum has been announced, but
Pinochet has said it will be in early October. If he wins a
majority in the referendum, the candidate will begin an eight-year
presidential term in March. If he is rejected by most voters, open
elections are supposed to be held in 1990.
   Opposition supporters have begun an intensive campaign for a
``no'' vote.
   Other commanders participating in the selection of a nominee,
navy Adm. Jose Merino, air force Gen. Fernando Matthei and national
police Gen. Rodolfo Stange, have said the candidate should give up
any military position. However, Pinochet's central source of power
has been his leadership of the army, and he is seen as reluctant to
relinquish it.

<HEAD>Gallup Poll: 48 Bush, 44 Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Gallup Poll released Tuesday found 48 percent
support for George Bush and 44 percent for Michael Dukakis in the
presidential race, with about half the respondents approving of
Sen. Dan Quayle as Bush's running mate.
   Fifty-two percent of the 1,001 registered voters surveyed in the
national poll said they approved of Bush's choice of Quayle, an
Indiana senator, while 27 percent said they disapproved and 21
percent were not sure.
   The survey was conducted from Friday through Sunday.
   An earlier Gallup poll found similar reaction to Dukakis' choice
of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as the Democratic running mate: 57
percent approved, 22 percent disapproved and 21 percent were unsure.
   Quayle has been embroiled in a controversy over whether he used
family influence to join the National Guard during the Vietnam War
and avoid the military draft. When asked in the new Gallup poll
whom they would choose if they could vote separately for the vice
president, 41 percent picked Bentsen and 36 percent Quayle.
   The four-point spread between Bush and Dukakis was within the
poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage
points, meaning it found the race to be statistically a dead heat,
radio station WEEI in Boston reported.
   A CBS News poll conducted over the same period last week found a
six-point spread, 46-40, between the candidates, with Bush
numerically ahead. Another Gallup Poll, done for Newsweek on
Thursday and Friday, found Bush ahead 51-42, while other polls done
just before or during the GOP convention last week found a dead
heat in the race.
   Dukakis had led by as many as 18 points in polls after the
Democratic convention in mid-July, a margin that pollsters
attributed to the rush of positive television publicity generated
by the convention.
   Dukakis' convention bounce was expected to fade, as it did, and
Bush was expected to gain his own boost after the Republican
convention, as the most recent polls indicate he has. The last
Gallup Poll before the GOP convention had the race at 49-42 for
Dukakis.

<HEAD>Two Guilty in Drug Firebombing</HEAD>

   A jury Tuesday convicted two men of arson for
firebombing the home of a man who had complained about drug dealers
in his neighborhood, where a policeman assigned to guard the man's
home was later shot to death.
   Claude Johnson, 28, and Robert Webster, 17, also were convicted
of criminal mischief and intimidating a witness in the trial-level
state Supreme Court.
   First-degree arson carries a maximum penalty of 25 years to life
in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 20.
   The Molotov cocktail attacks occurred in the early morning hours
of Nov. 10, two weeks after the victim, Arjune, a Guyanese
immigrant who goes by one name, had moved to the Queens
neighborhood of South Jamaica. He had repeatedly called police
about alleged drug-dealing outside his home in those two weeks,
most recently the night before the attacks.
   ``I saw these guys collecting money from people _ cars and so
forth,'' testified Arjune, who is now in the federal witness
protection program with his wife, son and daughter.
   About 4:25 a.m. on Nov. 10, he said on the stand last week, he
heard his family's dogs barking, looked through a window and saw
the defendants approaching his home, each carrying a burning glass
jar.
   ``I shouted at ... everybody to wake up,'' he said. ``I ran to
the window, where this gentleman, Webster, was trying to open my
window. ... I looked at his face, he looked at me. He was
determined to burn my house.''
   Arjune said the second firebombing occurred about two hours
after the first. In the first attack, four bottles were thrown, all
of which bounced off the house and landed outside. In the second,
three bottles were thrown, one of which went through a window and
set fire to the carpet and draperies while scorching the wall, he
said.
   Webster was involved in both; Johnson was arrested after the
first, he testifid.
   Arjune said he was burned on the arms and chest while hurling
the incendiary device back outside the house.
   ``I had no choice. I couldn't ...,'' he said before breaking
down in tears. ``I couldn't leave the fire to burn my house.''
   The firebombings caused police to post a round-the-clock guard
at the house. Last February, one of the guards, Officer Edward
Byrne, was shot to death in what police called an execution ordered
by high-level drug traffickers to retaliate for their own
prosecutions and imprisonment.
   The Byrne killing was not mentioned in the trial, because it was
ruled legally irrelevant to the firebombings.
   In their summations, defense attorneys pointed out
inconsistencies in Arjune's account of the firebombing and
questioned his identification of the defendants.
   Arjune is scheduled to testify at two other trials of people
accused of having threatened him.
   One defendant is Webster's father, also named Robert, who is
charged with witness intimidation. The other is Thomas Godbolt,
charged with coercion and menacing. Both have pleaded innocent.
   Godbolt is said by authorities to be associated with Lorenzo
``Fat Cat'' Nichols, who is serving a 25-year-to-life prison term
for major drug trafficking in Queens.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward and other officials have said
they believe Nichols _ whose alleged drug organization was the
target of 30 arrests on Aug. 11 _ may have ordered the murder of
Byrne. However, Nichols is not one of the four men charged with
Byrne's killing, and his lawyers have denied he was involved.

<TEXT>
   A multimillionaire businessman has
received a note from his kidnapped wife, the first indication that
the woman missing nearly a month may be still alive, the FBI
announced Tuesday.
   Robert Hearin received the note from his wife, Annie Laurie
Hearin, last week, officials said. Mrs. Hearin, 72, suffers from an
intestinal disorder that could be fatal if she doesn't get
medication.
   Wayne Taylor, special agent in charge of the FBI's Mississippi
operations, also announced that Hearin had paid a total of $1
million to 12 people named in the original ransom note discovered
the day Mrs. Hearin disappeared. None of the 12, who had lost
lawsuits to a company owned by Hearin, have been charged in
connection with the case.
   Taylor said investigators have no leads in their search for Mrs.
Hearin.
   ``We're optimistic and will continue to be optimistic and hope
for her safe return and nothing more,'' he said.
   Taylor said the news conference was called Tuesday to assure
Mrs. Hearin's abductors that her husband ``has done everything
conceivably possible to meet their demands, considering the
vagueness of them.''
   FBI analysis of the handwriting has confirmed Mrs. Hearin wrote
the letter, which was dated Aug. 10, postmarked Aug. 12 and
received at the Hearins' Jackson home Aug. 15, Taylor said.
   Taylor wouldn't disclose the city from which the letter was
mailed, nor would he discuss its contents other than to say ``it
urged him (Hearin) to comply with the demands of the kidnappers.''
   Hearin, who did not attend the news conference, is president of
Mississippi Valley Gas Co., and has holdings estimated at $100
million in various companies.
   The only word received from the kidnappers was a note left at
the Hearins' home the day of the kidnapping, Taylor said. The vague
note demanded Hearin right alleged wrongs to 12 people, later
determined by investigators as defendants in lawsuits filed by
School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., one of Hearin's companies.
   The $1 million was roughly equal to what the 12 had been ordered
to pay in damages in those lawsuits. The personal checks to the 12
were mailed Aug. 16, Taylor said.
   Hearin did not attend the news conference, but a statement from
him was read. ``I have done everything possible to comply with the
vague demands given me,'' it said. ``My children and I pray for the
prompt release and safe return of my wife and their mother.''
   The couple have two grown children.
   Taylor declined to reveal whether investigators had contacted
the 12 since the checks were mailed to determine if the kidnappers
had contacted any of them. He also said he wouldn't reveal whether
any of the 12 volunteered to return the money, considering the
circumstances under which it was given.
   He said Hearin had conferred with the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies before deciding to pay the money. Taylor said
it was ``a group decision.''

   Nicaraguan rebels who have entered
Honduras will be restricted to Honduran border areas to limit their
impact on the country, the foreign minister said Tuesday.
   Rebel leaders have said more than 9,000 rebel combatants, known
as Contras, are at base camps inside Honduras.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said many Contras
recently crossed into Honduras seeking refuge and humanitarian aid
distributed by the United States.
   Lopez Contreras said Honduras was allowing the U.S. aid to reach
the Contras as part of the peace plan signed last year by the
presidents of five Central American countries, including Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua.
   He said the Contras cross the frontier frequently because under
the plan they were to be assigned to a zone in Nicaragua that
borders Honduras.
   Lopez Contreras said some Contras were ``entering Honduras as
refugees, then later returning to their country to fight.''
   The foreign minister said that anti-communist rebels from
Nicaragua and leftist guerrillas from El Salvador have caused
Honduras serious problems.
   Both groups have been using frontier territory for their war
bases and Honduras' social stability has been damaged, Lopez
Contreras said.
   He said to try to alleviate the problem Honduras will restrict
the Contras to border areas while they await supplies from the
United States.
   Honduras faces ``peculiar'' problems because of the superpowers,
Lopez Contreras said, with the United States supporting the Contras
and the Soviet bloc helping Nicaragua's Sandinista government and
the Salvadoran rebels.
   Honduran critics have denounced the government, saying it is
helping the United States support the Contras. They also have
criticized the frequent joint military exercises by U.S. and
Honduran forces.
   There have been several anti-American demonstrations this year
in Honduras, which is considered one of Washington's strongest
allies in the region.

<HEAD>U.S. Hopes for ``Successful'' ABM Treaty Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States said it hoped for a
``constructive and successful session Wednesday to begin the third
U.S.-Soviet review of compliance with the 1972 ABM treaty limiting
missile defenses.
   The review is expekcted to last up to two weeks. The
anti-ballistic missile treaty requires such a meeting every five
years.
   A statement Tuesday from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva
reiterated the U.S. position that a Soviet radar under construction
in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, violates the treaty and that it should be
dismantled.
   Officials in Washington have said the main U.S. objective at the
review conference will be to have Moscow agree to dismantle the
station.
   Otherwise, the White House has threatened to declare the
facility a ``material breach'' of the treaty. This could clear the
way for the United States to overstep treaty limits in its
space-based missile defense program, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative and commonly called ``Star Wars.''
   U.S. officials in Washington said after the Moscow summit in
June that, until the radar is dismantled, conclusion of a separate
treaty limiting long-range nuclear forces would be impossible. That
appeaered to be the first such linkage by the U.S. side.
   The Soviets have consistently linked a long-range, or strategic
arms, agreement to limits on Star Wars, which Washington has said
it will not accept. The two sides are negotiating in Geneva with
the stated common goal of reducing their strategic arsenals by 50
percent.
   Both sides appeared to take a conciliatory attitude as the
meeting approached. The U.S. statement said, ``The United States
delegation looks forward to a constructive and successful review.''
   Viktor Karpov, chief of the Soviet delegation, said in an
arrival statement Saturday: ``The upcoming discussions should not
be confrontational.''
   The U.S. team is led by the director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, Maj. Gen. William Burns.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle on Tuesday denounced as ``outrageous'' new allegations about
his entry into the National Guard and his involvement with a woman
lobbyist.
   Quayle, preparing for his first solo campaign trip, said voters
``want to know about the issues. They are not interested in a bunch
of rumor and gossip and half truths and ... outright lies.''
   ``This is just getting a little bit outrageous and I'm getting a
little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another,'' Quayle
told reporters outside his home in McLean, Va.
   Quayle denied using his family's influence to get into the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   ``There was no influence used,'' Quayle said. ``I didn't have to
use any influence because before I applied there were openings,
when I applied there were openings and after I applied there were
openings.''
   But a retired Indiana guard official acknowledged Tuesday that
he asked the Guard personnel office to hold open a space for Quayle
after receiving a call from a Quayle family employee in 1969.
   Retired Major Gen. Alfred Ahner, former military support officer
for Indiana and later head of the state's National Guard, said he
was contacted by an old friend, Wendell Phillippi, a retired Guard
commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by Quayle's family.
   ``Wendell Phillippi had called and said he had a good man, and
said the thought he'd make a good Guardsman,'' Ahner said in a
telephone interview from Indiana. ``That's when I went over to
personnel ...I asked if they had any spaces for a good man.''
   ``They said they had a couple spaces. I said hold one of them,
there's a good guy coming over.''
   He said it was not unusual for Guard officials to take such
recommendations, and said he ``paid attention'' to Phillippi
because ``he was a former commanding general'' who would have an
eye for good Guardsman prospects. Ahner said Quayle received no
preferential treatment during his service.
   There have been conflicting reports about whether there were
vacancies in the Guard when Quayle sought entry.
   A 1969 Guard report indicated that the Indiana Guard was
overextended in mid-1969, but a month-by-month breakdown made
available Tuesday indicated that Quayle's specific unit had
openings when he joined up in May, and in the months before and
after.
   Capt. Cathi Kiger said Quayle's Guard unit had an authorized
strength of 138 people in May 1969. According to Guard records, 134
men were in the unit at the end of April, 132 were serving in May _
when Quayle joined _ and 133 men were enlisted in June.
   The Pentagon in Washington further said that Quayle's public
information unit of the Guard _ authorized for a staff of five _
had three individuals assigned to it before Quayle and another man
brought it to full strength in January 1970.
   Meanwhile, Playboy magazine released an excerpt from an article
in its forthcoming November issue in which one-time lobbyist Paula
Parkinson said she told the FBI that Quayle once propositioned her
but she rebuffed him.
   She said in the article that she and Quayle hadn't actually
slept together during a 1980 golfing vacation in Florida, but: ``We
flirted a lot and danced extremely close and suggestively. He said
he wanted to make love.''
   The release by Playboy followed a published report in which two
former attorneys for Ms. Parkinson say she told the FBI in 1981
about the alleged proposition.
   The Daily News of Los Angeles quoted the lawyers as saying that
Ms. Parkinson told the FBI Quayle propositioned her when Quayle _
then a congressman _ and two other legislators shared a cottage
during the trip.
   Quayle, who has been married since 1972, denounced the newspaper
report.
   ``That is just an absolute, flat-out falsehood,'' he told
reporters. ``I had nothing to do with her down there. I had nothing
to do with her before, and I had nothing to do with her afterwards.
I think y'all are going to have to be a little bit careful about
this, because it's totally untrue. I've got a wife and three small
children, and I hope there's some respect and dignity for things I
did not do before we go rushing off with all these so-called
rumors.''
   The two lawyers represented Ms. Parkinson when she was
questioned on March 28, 1981, by the FBI during an investigation of
whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation.
Ms. Parkinson was on the trip with Rep. Tom Evans, R-Del., who lost
his re-election bid in 1982.
   One of the attorneys, Washington lawyer Glenn Lewis, later told
The Associated Press that Playboy's account was consistent with
what Ms. Parkinson had told the FBI.
   ``Quayle made a pass at her, said he would like to sleep with
her. She said, `No, I'm with Tom.''' Lewis said, referring to notes
from the FBI interview.
   ``They didn't do drugs together, they didn't have sex,'' Lewis
said.
   Washington attorney Roy Kinsey, who also was present during the
interview, said his paraphrased notes show that she told the FBI,
``Quayle made a pass, and said he would like to sleep with'' her.
   Quayle spent Tuesday working on his stump speech in preparation
for his first solo campaign trip on Wednesday.
   He is to attend legislative conferences in Cincinnati and
Lexington, Ky., before traveling to St. Louis, where he will speak
to the Enlisted Association of the National Guard, composed of
current and former enlisted personnel.
   Questions about whether strings were pulled to get Quayle into
the Guard and into Indiana University Law School have threatened to
overwhelm his campaign.
   An average college student, Quayle did not meet the law school's
admission standards but gained entrance afer meeting with the
admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where Quayle's family
owns the local newspaper, according to published reports.
   A former dean at the school said Monday he was confident Quayle
received no special consideration.

   One person was killed and dozens were
hurt in a battle between members of a mob and police who kept them
from lynching two men suspected of raping and murdering a teen-age
girl, authorities said Tuesday.
   The violence took place Monday in the city of Araraquara in
southeastern Brazil, 170 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
   Capt. Nicolau Lambort of Araraquara state police said the
grandfather of the 14-year-old girl was shot to death in the
four-hour melee. Lambort said by telephone police did not know who
fired the shot.
   He said 14 policemen and 30-40 townspeople were injured, two
with gunshot wounds in their legs. No one was arrested.
   Lambort said a mob of 800 to 1,000 men and women tried to lynch
two men ``accused of the kidnap, rape and stabbing death of a
14-year-old girl abducted last Friday as she was walking home from
school.''
   He said the mob was ``doubly enraged'' because on Sunday, one
day after the girl was buried, ``unidentified individuals unearthed
her body and sexually molested it.'
   The captain said police quickly removed the two suspects and
took them to another city when the infuriated mob gathered in front
of the police station.
   ``Frustrated in their lynching attempt, the mob started hurling
rocks at the police station. Then they went on a rampage, smashing
windows of three banks and damaging other buildings in the city,''
he reported.
   He said Araraquara's 230-member police force was unable to quell
the riot and 200 more police officers were called in from four
neighboring cities.

<HEAD>FBI Has No Quota System for Management Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI has no quota system to ensure
Hispanics are included in a program to train agents for top
positions, one of the FBI's highest-ranking officials testified
Tuesday.
   ``We're trying to recruit the best people we can for the
program,'' said John Otto, executive assistant FBI director.
``There are no quotas at this time. But we want our very best
people to include minorities and women.''
   Otto, one of three men who share the bureau's No. 2 rank under
director William Sessions, testified in a discrimination lawsuit
against the FBI.
   Attorneys for the 311 Hispanic agents joined in the class-action
suit contend the FBI routinely keeps Hispanics out of a fast-track
promotion path that includes the four-day Management Assessment
Program.
   The plaintiffs contend the FBI discriminates against Hispanics
in hiring, promotion, assignments and discipline. They seek
unspecified damages and changes in FBI policies. About 400 of the
bureau's 9,400 agents _ or 4.3 percent _ are Hispanic, compared
with 8 percent of the general U.S. population.
   During the first week of testimony, about 40 agents _ Hispanic
and non-Hispanic _ testified that Hispanic agents are transferred
more often to undesirable locations, are given less glamorous or
more dangerous assignments and receive less recognition for their
successes.
   Otto said the FBI's Career Board, which supervises the
fast-track promotion program, holds an annual retreat in Quantico,
Va., to discuss the problems of minorities.
   No Hispanics sit on the Career Board, he testified.
   In other testimony, Melvin Jeter, head of the FBI's equal
employment opportunity office, said all 25 discrimination
complaints brought in the past by agents in the class-action suit
were determined to be unfounded.
   Asked by defense attorney Felix Baxter whether he considered
himself anti-Hispanic, Jeter said: ``I certainly do not. I
personally look forward to going to conventions and recruiting
Hispanic agents.''
   Margaret Gulotta, head of the FBI's linguist program, said any
agent who speaks a foreign language can be required to use that
skill throughout the agent's career.
   Agents can serve as language specialists for three years, then
ask not to be requested to use the language again. But a loophole
in the rule allows supervisors to ask those agents to do undercover
work, listen to wiretaps and do other assignments in the language
based upon the needs of the FBI.
   The plaintiffs contend the FBI abuses that loophole, keeping
Hispanic agents doing routine tasks, such as listening to wiretaps,
that do not lead to management jobs.
   The non-jury trial is scheduled to end Friday, and U.S. District
Judge Lucius Bunton is expected to render a decision within six
months. Federal employees are not entitled to jury trials when
suing the government in discrimination cases.

   Showers and thunderstorms stretched across a wide area Tuesday
from the East to the Plains, while heat records fell in parts of
Oregon, Washington and Florida.
   Rain and occasional storms continued into the afternoon from
western New York state and Pennsylvania across Ohio, southern
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and central Oklahoma.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were reported across much
of the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, and in parts of Michigan.
   Though the heat and drought has eased in most of the country,
records were set in a few scattered areas.
   Portland, Ore., reached 99 degrees by midafternoon, easily
breaking the record for the date of 93 set in 1985. The temperature
at Seattle-Tacoma international airport in Washington, 89, broke a
record of 86 set in 1985.
   Cooler temperatures were forecast in the Pacific Northwest for
Wednesday, however.
   In Florida, Daytona Beach broke the temperature record for the
date by early afternoon when the thermometer hit 96, a degree
hotter than the 1952 record, the National Weather Service said. In
Lakeland, Fla., the reading of 99 topped the record set last year
by 3 degrees.
   Temperatures climbed above 100 degrees in parts of Oklahoma and
Texas, including a reading of 106 in Dallas, one degree shy of the
record for the date. In Wichita Falls, Texas, officials issued an
advisory telling for residents to be aware of the possibility of
heat stroke when the heat index, which takes into account
temperature and humidity, passed 110.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at North Bend, Ore., to 104 degrees at Ardmore, Okla. The
early-morning low for the nation Tuesday was 25 degrees at Jackson,
Wyo.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.77 inch at Fort Knox, Ky.; 1.08 inch at Fort Wayne,
Ind.; 0.08 inch at Mansfield, Ohio; 0.79 inch at Toledo, Ohio; 0.78
inch at Louisville, Ky.; and 0.65 inch at Dayton, Ohio.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for rain and thunderstorms
from much of New England across Virginia, the Appalachians, the
Tennessee Valley, and from South Carolina across central Florida to
Louisiana; and scattered showers and thunderstorms in Upper
Michigan and from southern Nevada across Arizona.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were forecast from New England to New
Jersey and the Great Lakes; in the 80s from the central Atlantic
states across the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the upper and
central Mississippi Valley, the northern half of the Plains, and
the southern Rockies; in the 70s and 80s along the coast of
Washington and much of the California coast; about 100 degrees in
central Texas; near 110 in the desert Southwest; and in the 90s in
most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Believe Soviets Suffered Worst Losses In Explosion At Ammo Dump</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas and Western
diplomats believe Soviet forces suffered their worst losses in 8{
years of fighting in Afghanistan when an ammunition depot blew up
earlier this month.
   But in Mosow a Soviet spokesman said Tuesday there were no
casualties in the explosions at the depot at the military base at
Kalagay, 100 morth of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   The dump reportedly blew up Aug. 10 or Aug. 11 when it was hit
by rebel-fired rockets.
   Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad on Tuesday repeated
their earlier report that the rebels claimed at least 109 Soviets
were killed and eight helicopters were destroyed.
   Last week, guerrilla organizations said 500 Soviet soldiers
perished in the attack.
   London's Daily Telegraph, in its Tuesday editions, said up to
710 Soviet soldiers and civilians were killed. It said a report
received in Peshawar, Pakistan, from a guerrilla commander in the
Kalagay district claimed that 598 Soviet soldiers and 112 Soviet
civilians were killed and 284 Soviets were wounded.
   The Kalagay depot stored Soviet ammunition and weapons for
garrisons throughout the country.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, addressing
a regular news briefing in Moscow, confirmed there had been an
explosion at the Kalagay base but he added:
   ``The explosion took place at the place where they give arms to
people from other detachments and there were no casualties.'' He
did not say when the blasts occured, what might have caused them or
give further details.
   It is believed that the greatest loss suffered previously by the
Soviets in a single action occurred two years ago when fighting
near a mountain tunnel triggered an avalance and more than 70
Soviet troopers were killed.
   Western reporters normally are barred from Afghanistan by the
Marxist government and there was no independent confirmation of the
conflicting accounts of casualties at Kalagay.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help
battle the guerrillas but they are now being withdrawn under an
agreement signed in April by Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Western diplomatic and rebels sources said Tuesday the
guerrillas are trying to capture their first major city and are
attacking government forces aound three provincial capitals.
   They gave these reports:
   Rebels battled their way into Kunduz on Aug. 9, two days after
Soviet forces withdrew, but last week government troops regained
control and fighting continued.
   The Western sources said rebels shot down a Soviet plane flying
soldiers into Kunduz and up to 45 people aboard the craft perished.
   Kabul's official media said as many as 265 guerrillas have been
killed in the Kunduz fighting. It did not mention government
casualties.
   Guerrillas claimed they seized the provincial capital of Taloqan
on Aug. 12, but the claim was not verified and one Western source
said there was fighting around the city.
   On Monday, a rebel group said guerrillas had captured the
Arghandab district near Kandahar city.
   The Soviet Union had an estimated 115,000 military personnel in
Afghanistan and recently announced half of the force had been
removed as of Aug. 15.
   Under the April agreement, all of the Soviet troops are to be
out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15 and the Soviets have said they will
comply with the schedule.
   But there were reports that the withdrawal has slowed.
   ``We suspect this is a planned pause and that no further major
movements will occur until the onset of winter,'' one Western
diplomatic source said.
   He said the Soviets probably would ``make propaganda capital out
of the delay,''
   The Kremlin has accused Pakistan of violating the April
agreement by continuing to provide arms and bases for the
guerrillas and declared it would take unspecified measure if the
actions continued.
   The guerrillas did not participate in the peace negotiations and
have vowed to continue their fight.

   Former Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson says
GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle ``flirted'' with her
during a 1980 golfing vacation in Florida and ``he wanted to make
love,'' Playboy magazine said Tuesday.
   Chicago-based Playboy is featuring a 1980 nude photograph of Ms.
Parkinson as part of a ``Women in Washington'' pictorial in its
November issue, scheduled to reach newsstands on Sept. 27.
   The magazine also interviewed Ms. Parkinson about her 1980 trip
to Florida with Quayle, an Indiana senator who was a congressman at
that time, and two other legislators, including then-Rep. Tom
Evans, R-Del., whom she was dating.
   Playboy released a statement Tuesday that included the text of
Ms. Parkinson's remarks in the upcoming issue.
   ``There has been much speculation about an item that will appear
in the November Playboy about Republican vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle and former lobbyist Paula Parkinson,'' said
the magazine's statement, read by spokeswoman Elizabeth Norris.
   ``For clarification and to prevent exaggerated or excessive
further speculation, here is the exact quote from the November
Playboy:
   ``When DC lobbyist Paula Parkinson, star of a November 1980
Playboy pictorial, was asked about rumors of hanky-panky with
George Bush's VP choice Dan Quayle, she said she and Quayle hadn't
actually slept together during a 1980 vacation in Florida.
   ```He wanted to, but I was there as Tom Evans' date,' Ms.
Parkinson said. `We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and
suggestively. He said he wanted to make love.'''
   Ms. Parkinson's remarks to Playboy were similar to comments
released earlier Tuesday by two of her former attorneys, who
contended Quayle propositioned the lobbyist during the 1980
vacation.
   The Daily News of Los Angeles quoted the lawyers as saying that
Ms. Parkinson had told the FBI that Quayle propositioned her when
she shared a cottage with the three legislators.
   Quayle, who has been married since 1972, denounced the report.
   ``That is just an absolute, flat-out falsehood,'' he told
reporters. ``I had nothing to do with her down there. I had nothing
to do with her before, and I had nothing to do with her afterwards.
   ``I think y'all are going to have to be a little bit careful
about this, because it's totally untrue. I've got a wife and three
small children, and I hope there's some respect and dignity for
things I did not do before we go rushing off with all these
so-called rumors,'' he said.
   Washington attorney Glenn Lewis, who was one of the lawyers who
represented Ms. Parkinson when she was questioned by the FBI in
1981, said later the Playboy account was consistent with what Ms.
Parkinson told the FBI.
   She was interviewed by the agency as part of an investigation
into whether sexual favors were traded for votes on Capitol Hill.
   ``Quayle made a pass at her, said he would like to sleep with
her. She said, `No, I'm with Tom.''' Lewis said, referring to notes
from the FBI interview.
   Washington attorney Roy Kinsey, who also was present during the
interview, said his paraphrased notes show that she told the FBI,
``Quayle made a pass, and said he would like to sleep with'' her.
   Evans lost his re-election bid in 1982.

<HEAD>IMF Approves $1.4 Billion for Brazil,380</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday
approved a $1.4 billion loan to Brazil to supplement $5.2 billion
in bank loans, said a fund spokesman.
   The IMF loan, to be disbursed by installment until Feb. 28,
1990, gives officials the opportunity to cut off funds if Brazil's
economy has not performed as promised.
   In the past, the IMF has required borrowers to lower their
spending, especially on subsidies, in return for its help. Brazil
reportedly has promised to cut government spending by 22 percent.
   The fund's spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, did not say how
soon its loan would have to be repaid. But Brazil will have 20
years, including an eight-year grace period during which only
interest will be due, to pay back the $5.2 billion it borrowed from
the banks.
   The new loans amount to less than the interest payments on
Brazil's current debt of $121 billion, the largest in the Third
World. Last year the government suspended interest payments on its
bank loans, but began repayment again this year.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega said in July that the
suspension has not formally been revoked, but he said that might be
done when the country's 700 creditor banks joined the new
agreement. Last week he announced in New York that 95 percent of
the total had been committed.
   In addition to its mounting debts, the government of President
Jose Sarney has been struggling with inflation, which reached a
record 24.04 percent in July. One report has suggested Brazil's
inflation rate will reach 927 percent for the year, well above the
600 percent level reportedly set in the government's agreements
with both the fund and banks.
   On July 30, Brazil agreed in Paris with 13 creditor governments,
including the United States, to delay repayment of $5 billion of
its $l5 billion debt to them. The United States has the largest
block of votes in the IMF.
   The rescheduled debts, which fall due between Jan. 1, 1987 and
March 31, 1990 were delayed for 10 years, with a five-year grace
period.
   ``Brazil will pay neither a cent of interest nor principal until
March 31, 1990'' on this money, said Sergio Amaral, Brazil's
secretary for international affairs at the ministry of finance. The
country also has not reduced its principal on bank debt.

Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scheduled execution of a convicted
killer who has maintained his innocence for more than a decade was
stayed Tuesday by the Louisiana Supreme Court pending a review of
the sentence.
   After the ruling, Gov. Buddy Roemer said he would wait for the
court's review before deciding whether to commute the death
sentence of Ronald Monroe to life imprisonment without parole, as
the state's Pardon Board has recommended.
   It was not known immediately how long the court's review would
take.
   Monroe, 33, had been scheduled to die early Thursday for the
Sept. 9, 1977, stabbing death of Lenora Collins of New Orleans. The
victim's daughter, then 11, also was stabbed and testified that
Monroe was the assailant.
   ``I agree with the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision to stay
the execution of Ronald Monroe,'' Roemer said in a statement. ``In
capital punishment cases, it is the responsibility of all those
involved in the review process to be certain about administering
justice.''
   Earlier Tuesday, the governor said he was leaning against
commutation but probably would stay the execution for up to 100
days to allow courts to review the case again.
   The Pardon Board issued its recommendation Monday after a
hearing lasting more than five hours. Board chairman Yvonne
Campbell said the panel found that Monroe had been deprived of due
process of law. She would not elaborate or disclose how board
members voted.
   During the hearing, Monroe pleaded for clemency, maintaining
that he had not committed the slaying.
   ``I am innocent and will be innocent until the day I die,'' he
said.
   Prosecutors contend that Collins, 33, was killed after she told
Monroe he was being evicted from an apartment in her family's
duplex.
   Defense attorney Douglas Morris of New York said a reputed
confession to Collins' slaying by another man raised enough
questions to justify commutation.
   Courts have rejected the claim that George Stinson, convicted in
the 1980 stabbing death of his common-law wife in Pontiac, Mich.,
told a cellmate he killed Collins. According to court testimony,
the cellmate told police that Stinson merely said Collins had been
killed in the same way as the Michigan woman.

   Angolan rebels claimed Tuesday that they
killed 59 Angolan troops last week, releasing their statement in
Lisbon on the eve of the sixth round of peace talks involving South
Africa, Cuba and Angola.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola said the
troops were killed from Aug. 17-20 in separate actions in five
Angolan provinces, against the loss of six rebel fighters.
   No independent confirmation of the report emerged.
   The rebels, who are backed by the United States and South
Africa, are not a party to the U.S.-brokered talks. The discussions
so far have produced a cease-fire, signed Monday, which formally
ended hostilites in southern Angola.
   The rebel organization has been fighting Angola's Marxist
government since Portugal granted independence to its former
southern African colony in 1975.
   Cuba keeps an estimated 50,000 troops in Angola. The talks due
to begin Wednesday in Brazzaville, Congo, are expected to include
discussion of a timetable for their withdrawal.
   Other topics said to be on the agenda are:
   _Formation of a joint military commission to monitor the
cease-fire in southern Angola and withdrawal of 2,000-plus South
African troops from Angola.
   _Issues involving implementation of U.N. Resolution 435
regarding independence for South African-controlled South-West
Africa, known as Namibia.
   Chester Crocker, a U.S. assistant secretary of state and the
main architect of the southern African accord, has said a lasting
peace cannot be achieved without an internal political agreement in
Angola.
   But on Friday, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola
reiterated his government's refusal to negotiate with the rebel
group, which he said had wrecked efforts to establish a just
society in Angola.

   Palestinian underground leaders who oversee the
uprising in the occupied lands expressed frustration over the sharp
divisions in the PLO and urged Tuesday that the organization adopt
a clear political strategy.
   Also Tuesday, Israeli troops shot and wounded three Palestinians
during a clash in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the the Gaza Strip,
Arab reporters said, quoting officials at the Ahli Arab hospital in
Gaza City.
   An Israeli army spokesman said he had no reports of violence in
the Gaza Strip. The camp has been under a curfew since Monday.
   The call from Palestinian underground leaders to the PLO on
Tuesday came in a leaflet, the 24th issued since the rebellion
began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 252 Palestinian have been killed since the uprising
began and four Israelis have been slain.
   Factions in the Palestine Liberation Organization have been
feuding over proposals to create a government-in-exile and declare
an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, which
Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Most of the frustration occurs among mainstream elements who
support efforts to start peace negotiations with Israel. Those on
the other side feel such a move would aggravate divisions among
Palestinians.
   Daoud Kutta, a leading Palestinian journalist, said the main
division is over ``how to deal with the question of recognizing
Israel's right to exist.''
   ``People are saying the ambiguuity has to be cleared up,'' he
said.
   Supporters of PLO chief Yasser Arafat have called for a clear
statement recognizing the Jewish state as a means of spurring
negotiations. Opposing that view are the radicals, including the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine led by George Habash,
who oppose any concessions before peace talks.
   Tuesday's appeal was directed to the Palestinian National
Council, the 447-member body the PLO calls its parliament in exile.
It is expected to meet next month.
   It said the underground is ``certain the council will adopt a
comprehensive and clear political program which will gain
widespread international support for the national rights of our
people.''
   Although the leaflet stressed that the clandestine leaders were
not trying to take over, they clearly were prodding the PLO for a
decision.
   Salah Khalaf, deputy commander of Arafat's Fatah guerrillas,
said Monday on Austrian radio he expects a Palestinian government
and state to be formed by year's end.
   ``We are realists. Israel is there. It exists as far as the
political reality is concerned,'' he said.
   Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, has called for a provisional
government with a new charter to replace the PLO covenant calling
for the destruction of Israel and establishment of a democratic
secular state.
   The Khalaf proposal is opposed by pro-Syrian Palestinian
factions on the left and Moslem fundamentalist groups on the right.
   Hamas, a fundamentalist umbrella group whose name is Arabic for
zeal, says an international peace conference is an American plot to
create circumstances ``so some Palestinians can sign over Palestine
to the Jews.''
   Saleh Hussein, a Moslem preacher in Bethlehem, said in an
interview the fundamentalists want to create a pan-Islamic state.
   ``The PLO wants to live with Jews as partners either with two
different states or in one state, and we completely reject this
idea and refuse to be partners with the Jews in any plan,'' he
declared.
   A document circulated in the West Bank this month by the
pro-Syrian followers of Abu Musa attacked moderate calls for a
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and rejected a Palestinian state
limited to the West Bank and Gaza.
   Such a state ``means part of Palestine is not a home for its
citizens but a home of the Canadian, American and Russian Jews and
whoever is thinking of immigrating,'' the statement said.
   Jerome M. Segal, a University of Maryland professor whose
writings influenced Palestinians who drafted a proposed declaration
of independence, said a ``turning point'' had been reached in
Palestinian-Israeli relations.
   Segal, speaking to a Hebrew University audience, said
Palestinians should act on their own to declare a state and seek
international recognition.
   About five minutes into his speech, 12 supporters of the
right-wing Tehiya Party stood up and began chanting ``PLO, no!''
The hecklers sat down after a few minutes and left the hall shortly
afterward.
   In another development, Michel Sabah, the first Arab appointed
Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, rejected an invitation to
meet with Yitzhak Rabin, the defense minister. Rabin has held
private meetings with several other Palestinian notables.
   A church official said Sabah's refusal was in line with Vatican
policy of not meeting with Israeli authorities in Jerusalem.
   The Vatican does not recognize Israeli control over Jerusalem,
which was given international status by the United Nations under a
1947 partition plan. Israel captured the Arab section of Jerusalem
in the 1967 war, annexed it and declared the entire city the
Israeli capital.

   Iran on Tuesday claimed Iraq was massing
troops along the central and southern sectors of the border in
preparation for new military actions in violation of the cease-fire.
   Iraq, in turn, accused Iran of moving a regiment into what was
previously a no man's land between the opposing forces in the
central front. It said the Iranians withdrew after Iraq adopted the
``necessary measures.''
   In Tehran, Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
appeared at a ceremony to commemorate the death of a Shiite Moslem
saint in the 7th century. It was his first public appearance since
the Persian Gulf truce went into effect Saturday. Khomeini,
however, made no remarks.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati sent an urgent message to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar advising him of ``the
Iraqi regime's intentions to launch military operations against
Iran.''
   IRNA reported Velayati said Iraqis have massed troops facing
Fakkeh on the central sector of the border.
   It also quoted Brig Gen. Asghar Jamali, deputy commander of
Iran's ground forces, as saying that United Nations observers
watched an Iraqi armored brigade move up to the western bank of the
Nahr Anbar river.
   The agency reported Jamali said the Iraqis dug in and were
facing Iranian forces on the other bank of the river in the
southern sector.
   IRNA quoted Jamali as saying that at the request of the command
of the U.N. military observer group he ordered his troops not to
fire or react in any way to the Iraqi movements.
   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq open Thursday in Geneva and
claims by both sides of cease-fire violations could be an effort to
seek an advantage in advance of the negotiations.
   Iran's state-run television, monitored in Cyprus, showed the
88-year-old Khomeini at the ceremony of mourning for Imam Hussein,
who was killed in the year 680 by rival Moslems in a leaderwhip
dispute.
   Khomeini repeatedly covered his face with a hankerchief and
nodded his head as if crying _ a traditional manner of showing
mourning.
   The patriach, who said last month that accepting the cease-fire
was ``worse than drinking poison,'' stood up and walked from the
room unaided at the end of the ceremony.

<TEXT>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ George Bush declared Tuesday night he will
not abandon running mate Dan Quayle in the face of a host of
questions about Quayle's personal and social past.
   Standing before a crowd of supporters gathered in front of the
California State Capitol, Bush said: ``I'm not going to let some
insidious rumor-mongers drive me to change my mind. I'm standing
behind Dan Quayle.''
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said the campaign considers
questions about Quayle to be resolved.
   ``I think now it's just getting more petty,'' she said. ``It's
more partisan and less credible and we consider it behind us.''
   Earlier in Seattle, Bush said he was ``appalled'' at one query
about Dan Quayle's behavior with a female lobbyist and declared
that his campaign would get back on track ``whenever you stop
asking me these questions.''
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, earlier insisted that no
thought was being given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, calling
the 41-year-old Indiana senator ``a tremendous asset.'' And the
vice president's aides said they would refer future questions about
Quayle to the senator's own staff.
   Bush, while greeting workers at the Seattle Steel plant, was
asked by reporters about new reports concerning Quayle's purported
use of special influence to get into law school and the National
Guard when his undergraduate draft deferment expired during the
Vietnam War.
   The vice president responded simply that such stories were
exaggerated, and, when asked if his campaign was hurt by them, said
his message would get through to the people ``whenever you stop
asking me these questions.''
   And Bush told one reporter that ``I'm appalled that you could
ask'' about a report concerning Quayle's behavior with Ms.
Parkinson, the buxom lobbyist and later Playboy nude model who
shared a vacation cottage with Quayle and two other congressmen on
a trip to Florida in 1980.
   The Daily News in Los Angeles quoted two former attorneys for
Ms. Parkinson as saying that she told the FBI in 1981 that Quayle
propositioned her during the trip, but that she refused, saying
``I'm with Tom,'' _ then-Rep. Tom Evans, R-Del. Ms. Parkinson was
lobbying against a crop insurance bill which Quayle subsequently
voted against. Quayle has denied any impropriety concerning the
woman.
   And Playboy on Tuesday said an article in its November issue
will include a statement directly from Ms. Parkinson that Quayle
propositioned her during the trip.
   Bush, a day earlier, had made an impassioned defense of his
embattled running mate before the Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Chicago, and the Bush campaign had Quayle travel to
Chicago Monday night to make points in his own behalf.
   While the vice president mixed with hardhats on the grounds
outside the steel mill, Fuller told reporters that the storm over
Quayle ``is something the press is going to have to contend with,''
rather than the campaign.
   Fuller called the Parkinson report ``ridiculous. There's nothing
to it.'' Asked how he knew, he replied simply ``We are certain
there's nothing to it.''
   Asked about the latest stories detailing Quayle's purported
jockeying to get into the Indiana National Guard, Bush said, ``I
didn't see it. I never deal in rumors, especially if they're ugly
and hurtful.''
   Standing before an elbow-to-elbow, jam-packed rally later in
Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square later, Bush said that ``I have
my confidence in the new generation. I have my confidence in Dan
Quayle, and wait till you see this guy on job training and national
defense. You'll be as proud of him as I am.''
   At the steel mill earlier, Bush got a generally polite but cool
reception from an audience composed largely of members of a United
Steel Workers local.
   He toured the plant, getting a briefing from managers as he
stood on a high railing overlooking a smelter where molten steel
was being poured into huge vats.
   On the way into the plant site, Bush's limousine encountered
pro-Bush hard-hats on one side of the narrow road and hard-hats
carrying Dukakis signs across the way.
   ``I'm interested in how the members of the union feel, and I
think we're going to do pretty well with members, and that's where
you got to so,'' Bush said as he answered questions while greeting
people along a ropeline.
   ``Some of the (union) officials will be the other way _
historically they have _ but nobody can dictate to the working man
or a working woman ... how they vote.''

<HEAD>Idaho Farmers Scramble To Find Balers for Iowans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with equipment donated; ADDS quotes,
information on motel rooms donated.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Idaho farmers and equipment dealers Tuesday
responded to a state official's plea and donated balers, tractors,
trucks and other equipment to drought-cursed Iowa farmers lured by
an offer of free hay.
   Organizers of the hay harvest had been worried that there
wouldn't be enough machinery to keep the Iowans busy on Wednesday,
when they are scheduled to begin working.
   But offers of equipment began pouring into the Farm Bureau
office in Moscow Tuesday after Norman Plank, a Farm Bureau official
from Orofino, appealed on television for donations the night before.
   ``It's very, very encouraging,'' Plank said. ``I just can't
believe the response from people up here.''
   The 60 Iowans, who were scheduled to arrive in Moscow Tuesday
night after a 1,600-mile bus trip, planned to harvest hay on
pasture land that has been placed in the government's conservation
reserve program. The hay is to be shipped back to Iowa, where the
drought has stunted or destroyed thousands of pasture acres.
   Don Murdock, an Iowa Farm Bureau official in Chariton, said
organizers originally thought an equipment dealer association was
going to lend the balers and other implements the Iowa farmers
need. But the organizers later found out the association actually
wanted to lease the equipment.
   ``I'm sure it wasn't anything deliberate, just wishful
thinking,'' he said of the misunderstanding.
   Plank said all of the equipment made available Tuesday had been
donated, either by Moscow-area farmers or implement dealers.
   ``Hopefully, we'll have enough to keep everybody busy,'' he
said. ``We've got our fingers crossed. We're a little shy on
tractors yet and it's possible we need a few more trucks. But the
swathers and balers are coming in pretty good.''
   Plank said individuals and businesses in the area also called to
donate items such as food, cash, fuel and baling twine.
   In addition, 30 motel rooms were donated for a 10-day period, he
said. Before that offer, the farmers had planned to stay in
dormitories at the University of Idaho in Moscow.
   ``That puts them in a central location,'' Plank said. ``It will
be much easier to dispatch them out and work with them. It's a real
blessing.
   ``Right now we're a little concerned with transportation to and
from the field, but we're working on that right now.''
   Murdock said the need for hay was urgent. Some of the farmers on
the trip say they need at least 50 tons of hay to get through the
winter.
   With adequate machinery and land, one operator could harvest
that much hay in a day, Murdock said. A large bale of hay weighs
between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds and consumes about an acre of hay,
he added.
   ``But our need is so much more. I can't begin to put a number on
it,'' he said.
   Murdock said he could easily fill two more buses with farmers
wanting to help harvest the hay, but he has told callers there will
not be any more trips unless machinery becomes available.
   The venture is a cooperative effort of the Farm Bureau of Idaho
and Iowa, with Greyhound donating the buses, Burlington Northern
railroad donating freight space for the hay and three banks in
Chariton, a town of about 5,000 that is 45 miles south of Des
Moines, putting up cash for meals along the way.

   The Metropolitan Transit Authority has grounded
its fleet of 86 wheelchair-lift-equipped vans until officials can
determine what caused fires in two of them on the same day.
   The manufacturers, Ford Motor Co. and Collins Bus Corp. of
Hutchinson, Kan., planned to help in the investigation, officials
said.
   One van was engulfed in flames Sunday while the driver was
waiting for a passenger. No passengers were on board and the driver
was not injured. A second, less-serious fire was reported earlier
Sunday.
   Each van uses a Ford Econoline E-350 chassis fitted with a
wheelchair lift and other equipment by Collins. Metro put the $2.3
million fleet of vans into service in April.
   Until the problem can be studied further, Metro officials said,
they will rely on taxicab companies to transport MetroLift elderly
and handicapped patrons. Patrons will be asked to use the service
only for work and medical trips.
   On Aug. 4, Ford announced a voluntary recall of about 15,000
ambulances based on 1983-87 Econoline E-250 and E-350 chassis and
vans to replace engine compartment heater hoses. The automaker said
failure of the heater hose could result in a fire under the hood.
   Last September, Ford recalled 200,000 heavy-duty Econoline E-250
and E-350 vehicles to install underbody heat shields, special fuel
filler caps and, in some cases, high-flow fuel vapor venting
systems. Ford announced that recall to minimize any fuel expulsion
and to protect underbody components from high exhaust temperatures.
   Transit system spokeswoman Carol Boudreaux said officials were
unsure whether the problems cited in the recall orders would apply
to the system's new fleet. That was one of the things that the
investigation would cover, she said.

   ``You can't get there from here'' used to be
the punch line of jokes about rural America, but it's become a fact
of life for too many people, a congresswoman told a conference on
rural transportation Tuesday.
   The farm crisis, deregulation of the transportation industry and
too high a priority on urban transit has caused a major upheaval in
rural areas, Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., said.
   ``The revitalization of rural America cannot and will not occur
unless we guarantee mobility,'' she said.
   Intercity bus service has declined over the past 20 years, she
noted.
   ``Since 1982, more than 3,000 towns have lost their bus service,
and 92 percent of those towns have populations less than 10,000
people,'' Mrs. Smith told the two-day conference sponsored by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   She urged people in rural America to fight for their share of
transportation dollars.
   ``We make up 39 percent of the nation's population, but we get
less than 3 percent of the funds,'' she said. ``It's time we got
our fair share.''
   ``The nation's rural people need education and transportation,
but their population is decreasing, their affluence is dwindling
and they can least afford the services they need the most,'' said
New York State Sen. Charles Cook of Delaware County, in central New
York about 65 miles southwest of Albany.
   ``More than half of the nation's farm families rely on non-farm
income, as well. They are reliant on transportation. They don't
just go to town once a week to get staples anymore,'' he said.
   Mrs. Smith recounted results of a study made of the Black Hills
Stage Line, which makes a 564-mile daily trip from Omaha to Rapid
City, S.D., west across Nebraska on U.S. Highway 20.
   When the owners threatened to discontinue the line, Mrs. Smith
went to then-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole to plead the
case. She came up with $225,000 for a demonstration project to keep
the bus route alive for one year.
   She got more money in Washington and the Nebraska Legislature
came up with $50,000 during the recent session to match it for
another year.
   Results of the demonstration study revealed that half of the
people riding the bus had no other means of transportation.
Two-thirds said they couldn't have made the trip without the bus,
Mrs. Smith said.
   Half said they had a yearly income of less than $10,000 and
``one in every five said they were using the bus to go to work,
school or a job pool,'' she said.
   ``The towns are small, the distances are great, but the people
need the bus,'' she said.
   Mrs. Smith said she had been told that ``doctors rely on the bus
for medicine, hospitals for blood supplies, farmers for machinery
parts and the florist for flowers.''
   ``It's the only option for overnight deliveries. Many of the
state's elderly use it to get to the doctor and to visit friends
and family.''
   A ray of hope was offered by Michael Redisch, chief of research
and analysis for the Interstate Commerce Commission's Office of
Transportation Analysis.
   ``There's a lot of capital out there, a lot of old buses and old
terminals that need to be disposed of,'' he said. ``Secondly,
there's a whole new breed of managers coming to the deregulated
companies, and they're trying to break with past habits and
practices.''
   That transition spells promise for the future, he said, adding,
``New ideas and innovations will help change the face of rural
America.''

<HEAD>South Africans Protest Ban of Anti-Draft Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 students marched
around the University of Cape Town campus Tuesday to protest the
government's banning of a group opposed to the military draft.
   About 20 young men who addressed the demonstrators said they
would refuse to serve in the military, echoing the stand announced
by 143 other men this month.
   Military service is mandatory for white men and voluntary for
other races.
   Numerous anti-apartheid groups and individual activists have
condemned the ban imposed by police Monday on the End Conscription
Campaign, an organization founded five years ago which advocated
alternative, non-military service for young men with moral or
political objections to joining the armed forces.
   The Rev. Allan Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race chamber of
Parliament, was among those denouncing the ban. The black majority
is excluded from Parliament, which also has chambers for whites and
Asians.
   Hendrickse said there should be no conscription until all South
Africans have equal political rights.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan called Hendrickse's remarks a
``slap in the face'' to soldiers and accused him of playing into
the hands of terrorists.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's
largest black labor federation, said the ban was a sign of weakness
by the government.
   ``A government is in a serious crisis when it feels gravely
threatened by a smallish campaign questioning an aspect of its
policy,'' the federation said.
   ``Despite the powerful propaganda instruments at its disposal,
it is not able to stem the growing disquiet among whites about the
role of the defense force.''

   Troops in Burma killed up to 3,000 demonstrators
during a wave of protests two weeks ago and authorities have failed
to take measures to prevent ``further unlawful killings,'' Amnesty
International charged Tuesday.
   Citing reliable reports, the human rights organizaton said
Burmese soldiers acting under a state of emergency killed 1,000 to
3,000 demonstrators, mostly unarmed and peaceful, in violence this
month.
   Amnesty representative Ingrid Kircher told a U.N. human rights
panel that the soldiers appeared to use ``unreasonable and
unnecessary'' force against protesters and violated U.N. guidelines
for the conduct of law enforcement personnel.
   ``The emergency remains in effect, and there are no clear
indications of government action to prevent further unlawful
killings should demonstrations resume,'' she said in a statement to
the U.N. Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and
Protection of Minorities.
   Soldiers repeatedly fired into unarmed peaceful crowds and at
protesters who turned violent when the student-led unrest peaked in
the second week of August, Amnesty said.
   The organization said the Burmese government admits 112
demonstrators were killed but publicly denies wrongdoing by
security forces.
   Burma has been in turmoil since September when students rioted
over the voiding of 60 percent of the currency.
   Bloody rioting, increasingly focused on political demands,
occurred in March and June and, after a lull, resumed in late July
after hardliner Sein Lwin took over the country's ruling party on
July 26. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 and was replaced by Maung Maung
took power Friday.

<HEAD>President Says She Is Confident She Will Stay In Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Tuesday
she was confident her government will stay in power and said she
will personally guarantee the safety of Ferdinand Marcos if the
courts let him come home.
   At a news conference with Filipino reporters, the 55-year-old
president brushed aside charges of incompetence leveled by Vice
President Salvador Laurel and said she had ``more important tasks
to attend to'' than respond to his charges publicly.
   Mrs. Aquino was asked to comment on a statement made Monday by
her chief aide, Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig, that the
government could not afford to have Marcos return from Hawaii
because foes of the ousted president might try to kill him and
blame the slaying on the administration.
   ``In the event that Mr. Marcos is allowed by our courts to
return ... we will expect adequate security,'' she said. ``It (an
assassination attempt) will not happen because if it is necessary
(for) the chief of staff himself to go there and escort him, then I
will do that,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., was killed in
1983 while under military escort at Manila airport moments after
returning from three years in the United States.
   The shooting helped inflame popular unrest which toppled Marcos
and propelled Mrs. Aquino to the presidency in February 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to allow Marcos to return from Hawaiian
exile.
   Last week, however, an anti-corruption court said Marcos had the
right to cross-examine a former Cabinet minister, who is due to
give a deposition next November, if the statement was to be used as
evidence in any future criminal trial.
   Marcos, who is a lawyer, said he would demand the right to
conduct his own defense at the deposition hearing. Mrs. Aquino has
said she would abide by the decision of the court if it rules that
Marcos can return.
   Mrs. Aquino said Tuesday she was confident no new coup attempt
would be made during her three-day visit to Brunei, which begins
Monday.
   Rumors of a new attempt surfaced after Laurel this month called
on Mrs. Aquino to resign and order new presidential elections.
   She said Tuesday, ``I think ... there are enough people ... in
the nation, who support us and who are concerned about the
preservation of democracy in our country. So, I feel confident,
rumors notwithstanding, this government will continue.''
   Mrs. Aquino said of Laurel's charges: ``I would just like to
remind the vice president I know what my duties are as president of
the Philippines. I think ... that he knows what his duties are as
vice president. I don't want to engage in name-calling. I have more
important tasks to attend do.''

<HEAD>Ex-Black Panther Refuses Prison Release
^Eds: SUBS 6th-7th grafs, `Prison officers ...,' with 7 grafs to
explain more about consequences of Newton's action, background
about Streleski's refusal to leave prison.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther leader Huey
Newton refused to leave prison on his scheduled release date
Tuesday, demanding that officials also free fellow inmate and
ex-Panther Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt.
   Newton has been in prison for 60 days for parole violations.
Pratt, a convicted murderer, has been serving a life term since his
conviction in 1972. Two weeks ago he lost his eighth bid for parole
after a state panel called him a ``danger to the public.''
   Sue Gegner, an acquaintance of Newton's, said that Newton did
not expect Pratt to be freed. ``It's more of a statement that he's
trying to make,'' she said.
   ``Geronimo Pratt has been unjustly imprisoned for over 18 years
and he (Newton) feels very strongly about this,'' Gegner said.
   San Quentin spokeswoman Jeanne Ballatore said that when officers
went to Newton's cell Tuesday morning to begin release proceedings,
he refused to leave.
   Prison officers filed a disciplinary action against Newton for
refusing to obey a direct order. A state parole board panel met at
the prison later in the day and recommended that Newton's sentence
be lengthened by 30 days for violating the order, but Newton
instead requested a formal hearing by the full state parole board,
Ballatore said.
   He will remain in custody at least until the full hearing, set
for Aug. 30, and the board's decision about what action is in
order, she said.
   If Newton continues to refuse to leave, he can receive
additional discliplinary citations that require him to remain
behind bars up to the time his parole expires on Feb. 8, 1989.
   ``If at that point in time if he continues to refuse ... a
decision would have to be made. He'd be trespassing at that
point,'' she said.
   Authorities recall just one other inmate who declined to be
released from prison at the scheduled time, said Corrections
Department spokeswoman Christine May.
   Theodore Streleski killed popular Stanford University math
professor Karel DeLeeuw in 1978, smashing his head with a two-pound
hammer. He later called the killing a protest over treatment of
graduate students at the school.
   He refused to express remorse for the crime and turned down
parole three times from March 1984 to September 1985 because the
terms of his parole said he couldn't live in the San Francisco Bay
area. When he was finally released, his term for parole had expired
and he had no restrictions on where he could live.
   Newton served nine months of a 16-month state prison term for
possessing firearms as an ex-felon. He was released on parole Dec.
8.
   He was returned to custody in June for parole violations that
included failure to submit to drug testing and failure to advise
his parole officer that he had been arrested for investigation of
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
   Supporters of Pratt, a former Panther deputy defense minister,
contend he's a political prisoner and the victim of police efforts
to jail Panther leaders and dismantle the Oakland-based radical
movement of the late 1960s and early '70s.
   Pratt was found guilty of slaying a Santa Monica woman during a
$30 robbery in 1968. Her husband also was shot, but survived. Pratt
maintained he was at party headquarters in Oakland at the time.

<HEAD>Young Brazilian Woman Dies After Channel Swimming Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old Brazilian woman died Tuesday
night after trying to swim the English Channel, the coast guard
said.
   Renata Camara Agondi was pulled from the sea and into her escort
boat when she encountered difficulty eight miles from Cap Gris Nez
on the French coast at about 7 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT).
   A British Air Force rescue helicopter summoned from Manston in
southeast England took her from the boat and to Calais, France, but
she died in an ambulance en route to a hospital there, a coast
guard spokesman said.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said there was ``nothing untoward'' in weather conditions.
   Dr. Christopher Stockdale, medical officer for the Dover-based
Channel Swimming Association, said Miss Agondi was a marathon
swimmer of worldwide status who three weeks ago successfully
completed a world championship swimming race of similar distance.
   The cause of death was not determined immediately. Stockdale
said fatigue and hypothermia were possible factors in her death.
   He said a doctor examined her on Aug. 12 and found her
completely fit. Stockdale added that Miss Agondi appeared in
perfect physical condition and was in good spirits before setting
off from Dover for France Tuesday morning.
   In a straight line, the distance from the southeast English port
of Dover to the nearest point in France is 21 miles, but winds,
tides and currents make the distance longer for swimmers.
   Earlier Tuesday, high winds forced retired teacher Ashby Harper
of Albuquerue, N.M., to abandon his attempt to become the oldest
person to swim the channel. Harper, 71, was more than halfway
across when he decided to get out of the water.
   At least three people are known to have died previously trying
to swim the channel since the first proved swim in 1875 by Matthew
Webb, an English marchant navy captain. The last previous death was
in 1984.
   Fewer than one in 10 attempts to swim the channel are successful.
   About 300 people, the youngest age 12 and the oldest 68, have
conquered the waterway and a few of them have done it several times.
   The swim is difficult because of the cold and throat-parching
salt water, stinging jellyfish, floating logs, diesel fumes from
the escort boat, winds and opposing tides that drag swimmers into
an ``S'' course and nearly always add 10 miles or so to the
distance.

   Authorities on Tuesday still were
holding 15 of the 77 people detained during protests on the 20th
anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia,
government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said.
   A dissident source said those detained in Sunday's
pdemonstrations included six leaders of a peace group that
collected signatures on a petition demanding human rights and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia.
   At least five signers of the Charter 77 human rights document
were detained during the weekend. Dissident sources said at least
four were released Monday, but Charter 77 spokesman Bohumir Janat
was among those still detained.
   The official news agency CTK said Monday that 77 people were
detained Sunday when police charged demonstrators after a two-hour
march by thousands of people chanting demands for freedom and
democracy and the name of Alexander Dubcek, the leader of reforms
crushed by the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968.
   The demonstration was the biggest of its kind in 19 years.
   Pavel said those held were gradually being released but those
who were freed might face charges later.
   Pavel accused the Western news media of creating a furor both
about the demonstration and the anniversary of the invasion. He did
not identify the media.
   He said the West's disruptive aims were shown by a demonstration
last Thursday by members of the Italian Radical party, who held a
banner across Prague's Wenceslas Square demanding Soviet troop
withdrawal, democracy and human rights.
   At least 10 Radical Party members were detained and expelled
after that incident, which Pavel called ``an attempt to create
unrest and instability.''
   He said 4,000 people ``at most'' took part in Sunday's protests.
Western journalists estimated the demonstrations involved about
10,000 people.
   The spokesman said the government of Premier and Politburo
member Lubomir Strougal did not discussed Sunday's demonstrations
at the Politburo meeting Monday.
   Dubcek, leader of Czechoslovakia's communist government in 1968,
had introduced reforms during a period known as ``Prague Spring.''
He was removed and his government replaced following the invasion.

<DATELINE>TINGO MARIA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday that guerillas
using explosives heavily damaged a jungle bridge on a main highway
near Tingo Maria.
   They said the Monday night attack, 220 miles northeast of Lima,
came during a three-day ``armed strike'' against a U.S. proposal to
kill coca plants with a herbicide.
   Cesar Acosta, chief of anti-drug police in the region, said
guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement called the attacks
and used fallen trees, rocks and boulders to block roads leading to
Tingo Maria.
   The rebels are urging peasants to protest a U.S. proposal to
spray coca, the raw material of cocaine, with the herbicide Spike.
The government says rebels protect drug traffickers in exchange for
funds to buy arms.
   The Huallaga Valley north of Tingo Maria is known as the cocaine
cradle because about 60 percent of the world's coca is harvested
illegally there.
   Coca leaves are refined into semi-processed cocaine and then
smuggled into Colombia, where it is refined into cocaine for sale
abroad.
   Environmentalists have criticized the hebicide plan, saying that
Spike will denude all plants and ruin the zone for food crops for
years to come.
   Peru demanded more testing before Spike is used and the U.S.
government agreed.
   Acosta said police recovered pamphlets signed by the Shining
Path protesting the Spike plan and the presence of agents of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in the area.
   About a dozen U.S. agents have been in the area for more than a
year advising Peruvian anti-drug units, the government has said.

   Leaders of the banned Solidarity free trade union movement

intervention against strikers more likely.

   Many residents said they feared that a wave of strikes that

   But there was little evidence of accelerating retail price

   Including the drought-related price spikes for food _ which

   Noriega's political foes did not even draw much enthusiasm from

   Tens of thousands of people marched 40 and 50 abreast in the

   ``In the short and medium term, I doubt that it will mean

is, Arnulfo is gone but Noriega's still here.''

carriageway with a bad silencer and not a spanner in the boot.
   ``Driving in the U.S.A.,'' a 32-page pamphlet written by two
British journalists, aims to dispel some of the mystery of motoring
the American way, and to protect this year's crop of self-driving
British vacationers from death, speeding fines and big lawsuits.
   The pamphlet is another of those occasional reminders that the
potential for Anglo-American misunderstanding is enormous,
especially on the highways. They drive on opposite sides and have
little in common other than that both use miles instead of
kilometers.
   Tim Symonds and co-author Lesley Abdela say 300,000 copies of
their booklet have been distributed to travel agencies and airlines
selling fly-drive vacations in the United States.

<HEAD>`Tanner' Fades on HBO and Hopes for Jump to PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boy, will HBO be in trouble if Michael Dukakis
is elected president. The cable channel has dropped ``Tanner '88,''
the series about a fictional underdog presidential candidate, and
Kitty Dukakis is such a fan, she was in it.
   Mrs. Dukakis did a cameo in the final episode, filmed last month
at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   HBO had agreed to carry the Robert Altman-Garry Trudeau series
only through the convention, but the Tanner crew hoped to get an
extension, based on their good critical notices, and take candidate
Jack Tanner through the November election as an independent.
   Except for a possible pre-election special, the series' final
episode, ``The Reality Check,'' airs Thursday as well as Aug. 28
and 30.
   ``Otherwise, this is it _ I'll ride off into the sunset,'' said
Michael Murphy, who plays Tanner. ``Next week this time I'll ... be
out of work and depressed.'''
   Murphy may only be out of work temporarily. The Public
Broadcasting Service is hoping to find an underwriter to pick up
the series and move it to public television for the rest of the
campaign. That will take some doing, since time is short and the
show is expensive.
   ``I've never had response to a character that I've had with
this,'' said Murphy in an interview on the set in Atlanta. ``The
response is not only positive, it's intelligent. We get people who
get it, who get what we're trying to do here. Everybody except HBO,
I guess.
   ``If I had a show that was talked about the way this show is,
and had Garry Trudeau and Robert Altman under my wing, I'd be
jumpin' up and down. We'd love to take it to the election, which
would be a nice way to finish this thing.''
   A move to PBS, said Murphy, ``would be great, because we could
reach the audience we're really looking for, and you wouldn't have
to be wired up and there still wouldn't be any commercials. I'd
love to be over there. And they're trying as we speak, they're
trying to get the dough.''
   Trudeau, who writes the scripts and is co-producer, is the
cartoonist of ``Doonesbury'' fame. Director Altman (``M-A-S-H,''
``Nashville'') is known for his facility with improvisation and
gritty realism.
   The two combined to create a fictional series that feels like
the real thing, and in fact Tanner's campaign slogan is ``For
Real.'' In Atlanta, confused passersby spotted the Tanner office in
the CNN Center and stopped stock-still. ``Which one is that?'' one
woman wondered when confronted with the Tanner billboards.
   But most of the politically savvy crowd in town for the
convention were up on Tanner.
   ``What'll you do if you really win?'' joked a woman who spotted
Murphy relaxing near the set. Murphy just laughed.
   Tanner has run into all his ``opponents'' along the campaign
trail, and many have done cameos. In Atlanta, the Tanner crew
learned Mrs. Dukakis was a fan when one of her staffers told them
she'd like to do a scene.
   ``We said what do you want to do?'' Murphy recounted, ``and she
said, `Well I want to do a scene with that girlfriend.'''
   Tanner's girlfriend, Joanna, was skulking around in the early
episodes because she was working for the Dukakis campaign.
   ``We went up and sort of started kicking things around,'' Murphy
said. ``Garry Trudeau said, `Well, she (Joanna) should be a little
nervous, because she's shown some lapses in judgment here,' and
Kitty said, quite spontaneously, `What, for falling in love?' So we
thought that was great, and we thought we'd shoot something like
that.''
   In ``The Reality Check,'' Joanna (Wendy Crewson) has lunch with
Mrs. Dukakis, who forgives Joanna her indiscretions, then asks her
to seek Tanner's support for Dukakis.
   By the end of the episode, Tanner's staff is pondering whether
to run their man as an independent.
   Emile, the campaign's pollster, played by Jim Fyfe, argues in
favor of an independent run: ``Leadership isn't about management,
especially given the very real limitations on presidential power.
It's about values. It's about choosing roads, not paving them.''
   The episode concludes with Joanna, back from her lunch. ``It's
over, Jack,'' she says. ``Isn't it? ... Jack?'' Tanner stares
enigmatically into the camera as the credits roll.

<HEAD>Big Shuffle Of Bishops Set By United Methodists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As in some nationwide game of musical chairs,
United Methodists have ordered their big reshuffling of bishops. By
Sept. 1, they're to be in their new places.
   It's a quadrennial change-about of area leadership in which some
bishops, new and old, are deployed to different posts. This time,
21 bishops were involved, 40 percent of the church's total of 50
active U.S. bishops.
   In the process, five regional conferences July 12-16 elected a
total of 15 new bishops. They were consecrated and assigned to
areas other than where they came from. Six incumbent bishops were
transferred to new areas.
   The moving-about of clergy, bishops and pastors, reflects the
denomination's ``itinerant ministry,'' which stems historically
from early American ``circuit riding'' ministers, always on the go.
   ``The purpose is to infuse new blood and fresh ideas, so people
don't get into a rut,'' says Thomas McAnally of Nashville, Tenn.,
director of the denomination's news service.
   ``However, pastors used to be moved much more often that they
are now,'' he added, noting that some church-growth studies
indicate that longer pastorates are more effective.
   Pastors now generally serve congregations several years, some
indefinitely, but are subject to annual appointment by their
bishops. Bishops, in office for life, are limited to serving two
four-year terms in each place, except in special circumstances.
   The current re-posting of bishops and choosing of new ones in
the 9.6-million-member denomination occurred at five jurisdictional
conferences, involving a total of about 2,000 delegates, half
clergy and half laity.
   Two women were elected as bishops, each in their early 40's,
among the youngest bishops ever named in U.S. Methodism's history.
Under church law, they won't have to retire until 2012.
   They are:
   Bishop Sharon Brown Christopher, 43, of Waukesha, Wis., elected
at the North Central meeting in Buckhannon, West Va., assigned as
bishop in Minneapolis, replacing retired Bishop Emerson S. Colaw.
   Bishop Susan Burch Morrison, 45, of Baltimore, elected at the
Northeastern meeting in De Kalab, Ill., assigned as bishop in
Philadelphia, replacing Bishop F. Herbert Skeete, who was
transferred to Boston.
   The denomination has one other active woman bishop, Judith Craig
of Detroit, and two previous women bishops, Leontine Kelly of San
Francisco, retired, and the late Marjorie Mathews of Detroit who
died in 1986.
   Other transfers besides Skeete included Bishops George W.
Bashore from Boston to Pittsburgh; Edwin C. Boulton from Fargo,
N.D., to West Canton, Ohio, replacing retired James S. Thomas;
Calvin D. McConnell from Portland, Ore., to Seattle, Wash., and
Melvin G. Talbert from Seattle to San Francisco, replacing the
retired Kelly.
   Also, Bishop John W. Russell of Dallas was transferred to to the
newly created Fort Worth area, formerly combined with Dallas, while
newly elected Bishop Bruce P. Blake, formerly a Winfield, Kan.,
college president, was assigned to Dallas.
   Blake was elected at the South Central meeting in New Orleans,
which also elected Bishops William B. Oden, an Enid, Okla., pastor,
assigned to Baton Rouge, La., replacing the late Walter L.
Underwood, and Dan E. Solomon of Corpus Christi, Texas, assigned to
Oklahoma City, replacing retired John W. Hart.
   Blake, Oden and Solomon were all consecrated in ceremonies at
New Orleans' Roman Catholic Cathedral.
   ``It was a great ecumenical gesture,'' said the city's Catholic
Archbishop Philip Hannan.
   The Western jurisdiction, meeting in San Diego, elected only one
bishop, but it took 38 ballots over about three days to do it. He
is William W. Dew Jr., an Alamo, Calif., pastor and former theology
professor, assigned to Portland, Ore., replacing transferred
McConnell.
   The North Central meeting in De Kalb, besides electing
Christopher, also elected two male bishops.
   They are R. Sheldon Duecker of Muncie, Ill., assigned to
Chicago, replacing retired Jesse DeWitt, and William B. Lewis of
Belleville, ill., assigned to Fargo, N.D., replacing transferred
Boulton.
   Not for about 50 years had one jurisdiction elected so many
bishops in one year as the seven elected in the Southeastern
meeting at Lake Junaluska, N.C.
   One was black, Bishop Joseph B. Bethea, district superintendent
in Raleigh, N.C., assigned as bishop at Columbia, S.C., replacing
retired Roy C. Clark. He becomes the denomination's 13th black
bishop.
   Other Southeastern elections were:
   Bishops Thomas B. Stockton of High Point, N.C., assigned to
Richmond, Va., replacing retired Robert M. Blackburn; H. Hasbrouck
Hughes Jr. of Richmond, assigned to Lakeland, Fla., replacing
retired Earl G. Hunt.
   Also moved were Bishops Richard C. Looney of Knoxville, Tenn.,
assigned a new area of Macon, Ga.; Robert H. Spain of Nashville,
Tenn., assigned to Louisville, Ky., replacing retired Paul A.
Duffey.
   Bishop C. W. Hancock of Macon City, Ga., was assigned to a new
area of Montgomery, Ala., and Bishop Clay F. Lee of Jackson, Miss.,
was moved to Knoxville, Tenn., replacing retired R. Kern Eutsler.

<HEAD>South Korea Disappointed At U.S. Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea has expressed ``deep
disappointment'' at a U.S. trade bill signed into law by President
Ronald Reagan, saying it will create a confrontational world
trading environment.
   In a statement, the Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. trade bill
signed Tuesday of having ``all the protectionist elements which
aroused so much concern and protest from Korea and many other
trading nations.''
   ``We are particularly concerned with the likely
counter-reactions from U.S. trading partners,'' the statement said,
adding the bill's legislation would entail enactment of similiar
laws or retaliations.
   The statement also urged the U.S. adminstration to ensure ``the
law be implemented in such a way as not to adversely affect either
the smooth growth of the Korea-U.S. trade relationship.''
   The new law is designed to battle the U.S. trade deficit by
streamlining machinery for imposing import curbs, which would
retaliate against international trade violations.
   It also expands job training for workers left unemployed by
import competition and strengthens the administration's hand in the
current round of world trade talks.

   The Department of Housing and Urban

the sales of foreclosed single-family dwellings would bankrupt a
Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance fund.
   The fund has helped millions of first-time, low- and
moderate-income homebuyers since its creation in the 1930s, HUD
said Monday.
   HUD called off a sales campaign for foreclosed properties
because of the threat of a lawsuit by the National Housing Law
Project. The group claims HUD is violating a homeless-assistance
law passed last year that requires government agencies to consider
the needs of the homeless before selling foreclosed properties.

   Oil futures prices are mostly higher in what
analysts called a relatively directionless market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, edged up 3 cents a barrel Monday to close at $15.76.
   Monday was the final day of trading in the September contract,

slipped 0.07 cent to finish at 47.52 cents a gallon, but other
contract months gained. Wholesale heating oil for September rose
0.25 cent a gallon to 44.73 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the market was awaiting fresh developments
affecting supply and demand or the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``The market is trading in two- and three-day trends,'' said
Richard Redoglio, a vice president of Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
``There's not much news out there to go on.''

<HEAD>Spencer Gifts Going Yuppie, Moving Away From Inexpensive
Mail-Order Items</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $400 picture telephone and
other expensive gadgets are taking their places alongside the Santa
Claus toilet paper, windshield ice protectors and other household
items that for years have characterized the Spencer Gifts catalog.
   Changing demands in the mail-order business mean a newer,
increasingly upscale product lineup for Spencer, greater
concentration on retail outlets and a new, computerized telephone
ordering system, company president John Hacala said in a recent
interview.
   For years, Spencer Gifts Inc. could get by with its offerings of
elastic bra extenders, personalized calendar towels and other
inexpensive, unusual household items and gadgets.
   ``It's nothing you need and everything you'd like to have,''
says Laurin LeTort, the company's vice president of human resources.
   But competition and a changing consumer profile have forced some
changes.
   ``The mail-order industry has become a booming business,
especially with more expensive merchandise, such as what L.L. Bean
and J. Crew offers,'' LeTort said of the clothing retailers. ``For
years, Spencer Gifts and several other companies stuck with
lower-price products.
   ``But with postage increases and higher wages, it's become
difficult to operate at that level.''
   In recent years, Spencer has concentrated most of its energy on
retail stores, usually located in shopping malls. The company has
more than 600 stores in 46 states, LeTort said.
   Spencer also plans to change the focus of its catalog
merchandise, in an effort to keep up with its changing customers.
   A first step has been the introduction of several ``A2Z'' stores
and catalogs, featuring more expensive products and gadgets, such
the $400 picture phone, a $30 baseball cap with a solar-powered
fan, a $70 inflatable raft complete with built-in toy machine guns
and a $200 neon telephone.
   Spencer Gifts stores are geared to attract younger consumers,
while catalogs from Spencer Gifts Inc. traditionally have attracted
women over 45 years old in rural America, Hacala said.
   ``But now 50 percent of American women are in the workforce, and
time is not available to hit the stores as much, so they like to
shop out of a catalog for the things they really need,'' he said.
   Spencer Gifts eventually will change its catalog offerings to
reflect the shopping trend, Hacala says. He says the company also
must select more expensive products for financial reasons.
   ``We can't continue concentrating on 88-cent products,'' Hacala
says. ``You can't pack and ship that merchandise cost-effectively.''
   The final figures are not in but Spencer Gifts, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of MCA Inc. in Los Angeles, projects sales of $300
million for 1987.
   In the catalog business, LeTort says, the company is ``about the
last of the few survivors at the lower end of the market. We need
to reposition ourselves to go after a higher profit margin.''
   By switching its focus, Spencer Gifts will transfer its
mail-order facility in Atlantic City to Williamsburg, Va., where
labor is more readily available at lower wages than in the
Northeast. More than 200 full-time jobs will be affected, although
another 800 or so people traditionally have been hired as temporary
packers during the busy holiday season, Hacala says.
   He says the company's national headquarters will remain in Egg
Harbor Township.
   Spencer also must modernize its mail-order system, one of the
originals in the business.
   Since 1947, a paper order form in each catalog has been the only
way to order, Hacala said. Now, the company is investing in an
elaborate computer system that will allow customers to order via a
toll-free telephone number, he said.
   ``People want instant gratification,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Reports on Program Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Market strategists say the New York Stock
Exchange's first monthly statistical breakdown on computer-driven
trading reinforces their view that the broad range of investors
remained sidelined nearly 10 months after the 1987 crash.
   The report released Monday also indicated that computerized
program trading accounted for only a tenth of the NYSE's light
volume in July, with most of it done by a few big brokerage firms _
included some that briefly had halted the practice for their own
accounts.
   The report provided some of the most detailed figures yet
available on the short-term and highly profitable trading
technique, blamed by some studies for playing a role in the crash
and creating volatility that has frightened investors away.
   It showed program trading in July accounted for only 10.1
percent of the average daily trading volume of 166.9 million
shares. By contrast, program trading accounted for about 20 percent
of the record volume during the crash.
   Some professionals called the NYSE report significant because it
suggested program trading had declined substantially. But others
said the report showed that apathetic post-crash investor
participation in the market, an increasing concern on Wall Street,
was even worse than previously thought.
   When program trading is added to dividend-captures and other
short-term techniques that inflated volume last month, the amount
of ``genuine'' investing in stocks constituted 80 million shares a
day or less, some said.
   ``You're really looking at about 50 percent of the volume that
has been relatively meaningless,'' said Jack Barbanel, a strategist
at Gruntal & Co. in New York. ``If you're trying to gauge whether
people are coming back to the market, this tells you they're not.''
   Another trading strategist, who spoke on condition he not be
identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said of the
NYSE report: ``Here's what I think is happening. Nothing's
happening. There are so few real buyers ... there's nothing.''
   Program trading is a generic term referring to the purchase or
sale of large amounts of stocks or groups of stocks through the use
of high-speed computer connections between brokerages and trading
exchanges.
   The most controversial form of program trading is called index
arbitrage, which involves the sale of stocks in one market and
purchase of stock-index futures in another, or vice versa, to
profit from brief price disparities.
   Index arbitrage has been blamed for injecting sudden and
unpredictable price swings into stocks without regard to underlying
values. A clamor about index arbitrage compelled several major
brokerages to announce earlier this year they had suspended its use
for themselves but would do it for customers.
   The NYSE report suggested Bear Stearns Cos. had resumed index
arbitrage for its own account, trading 30.2 million shares in July.
Bear Stearns' chairman and chief executive, Alan Greenberg,
confirmed in a telephone interview that the firm was back in the
index-arbitrage business.
   The report also showed Merrill Lynch & Co. traded 7.2 million
shares for its own account; Morgan Stanley & Co. traded 5.2
million; PaineWebber Group Inc. 4.6 million; Goldman Sachs & Co.
1.4 million; Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 800,000; Kidder Peabody
Group Inc. 600,000; and Salomon Brothers Inc. 100,000. Officials at
Morgan, PaineWebber, Goldman, Kidder and Shearson said their house
ban on index arbitrage remained unchanged. Morgan, PaineWebber,
Goldman and Kidder aides said the NYSE figures were distorted
because trading reported on their own accounts was actually done on
behalf of customers.
   Shearson spokesman James Podany said the figure reported by the
NYSE represented another form of program trading, not index
arbitrage. Salomon officials did not return telephone calls.
   The NYSE report also indicated 65.4 percent of all program
trades executed through the exchange were related to index
arbitrage. It also showed that Morgan, Merrill, Bear Stearns and
two smaller investment concerns, Susquehanna Investment Group and
L.I.T. America Inc., accounted for almost 75 percent of all index
arbitrage in July.
   NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said the report was part of an
NYSE decision in May to require all member firms to disclose
statistics on program trading. She said the monthly reports were
created ``to make as much information available to investors as
possible.''

<HEAD>Renamed Car May Be Reviving Sales For Audi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audi of America Inc. is showing signs of
rebounding from a dramatic sales decline that followed complaints
and lawsuits over accidents caused by unintended acceleration of
some Audis, according to one company executive.
   Richard Mugg, vice president in charge of Audi of America, said
Monday that if the company maintained its early August sales pace
it would top the month's sales goal of 2,600 cars.
   ``In the past, for Audi, that would have been no big deal. But
when you are in a recovery process it's very encouraging,'' he said.
   Mugg credited Audi's revision and renaming of one line of U.S.
cars, plus a new warranty aimed at high-cost maintenance, for
aiding the early sales rebound.
   Sales in the first two weeks after the Aug. 1 introduction of
Audi's new warranty and new 100 and 200 Series cars were up 59
percent from the first half of July, Mugg said.
   He acknowledged that July was a slow month to compare with, that
late summer sales usually are not brisk and that July also marked
the closeout of the discontinued Audi 5000 line.
   Audi of America's sales reached about 74,000 in 1985 but dropped
to 41,000 last year _ and Mugg has projected 27,000 in sales for
this year _ after a wave of complaints of sudden, unintended
acceleration incidents leading to accidents and lawsuits.
   The complaints also have involved other brands of automobiles,
but not as often as Audis. Audi engineers and other investigators
have failed to find a mechanical fault.
   Audi began installing interlock devices designed to prevent the
car from being put accidentially into gear with a foot on the
accelerator, and 275,000 automatic transmission cars were recalled
in October 1987 for installation of the devices.
   Mugg said Audi since then had counted only 14 sudden
acceleration complaints, and he said those were on cars with
improperly installed interlocks.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Board is investigating 433
complaints involving the interlock-equipped Audis, but NHTSB
spokesman Ron DeFore said the complaints, which still must be
confirmed, involve engine surge rather than the full acceleration
described in earlier complaints.
   ``We have felt that an interlock was sufficient,'' DeFore said.
   Audi's former three-year, 50,000-mile warranty was expanded to
cover scheduled maintenance, all dealer visits and even routine oil
changes and parts such as wiper blades, brake pads and light bulbs.
   ``We're the only one covering maintenance and wear and tear for
50,000 miles,'' Mugg said.
   Audi's marketing also is emphasizing technological advances such
as anti-lock braking systems and all-wheel drive available on 100
and 200 series Audis, Mugg said.
   While the new models show only minor exterior changes from the
Audi 5000 body shell, the cars are more extensively changed beneath
the skin, with more than 1,400 new parts, Mugg said.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower But Rebounding, Gold Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A round of coordinated central bank intervention
pushed the dollar lower in early European trading today but dealers
said the U.S. currency was rebounding as the market shrugged off
the attempt to check its advance.
   Gold prices were higher in quiet trading.
   The central banks of West Germany, Switzerland and Austria said
they sold dollars in the open market in Frankfurt this morning and
the Deutsche Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, said it had
intervened earlier in the day in Asian trading.
   None of the banks would say how many dollars they sold but
dealers in Frankfurt and Rome said the size of the intervention was
such that the market easily absorbed it.
   One Rome trader estimated the total size of the intervention at
``maybe several hundred million dollars.''
   Dealers said the dollar continues to be well bid despite the
show of unity by central banks to keep the currency under control.
   ``The market is still bullish'' toward the dollar, one trader
said.
   Traders said two U.S. economic indicators being released later
today could give the market some new momentum.
   The market expects July consumer prices to rise 0.4 percent
following a 0.3 percent rise in June and durable goods orders to
drop 5.4 percent in July following a 9.4 percent rise in June,
dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar closed at 133.93 yen, up fractionally from 133.88 yen
late Monday. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.9056 West German marks, down from 1.9190; 1.6035
Swiss francs, down from 1.6105; 6.4660 French francs, down from
6.5050; 2.1498 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1605; 1,411.60 Italian
lire, down from 1,417.00; and 1.23 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2291.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6815, compared with
$1.6767 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $433.10 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $432.70, both up from Monday's late bid of
$432.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $432.90, up from $431 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.58 to close at a bid $434.59.
   Silver also rose in London where it was quoted at a bid price of
$6.74 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $6.64.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suffered a decline for the
second day in a row today amid fears of higher interest rates and
lack of direction in the market, while the dollar held firm,
closing at 133.93 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues plunged 159.23
points, following a 130.24-point loss Monday, to end the day's
trading at 27,919.95. It was the first time for the Nikkei average
to close below the 28,000-point level since Aug. 16.
   Volume on the first section was thin, an estimated 500 million
shares, down from the previous day's 600 million.
   Declining share prices and modest trading in Tokyo were because
of investors' wait-and-see mood due to spreading fear of higher
interest rates world-wide, stock dealers said.
   ``The overnight plunge on Wall Street directly affected us
today,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities Co. in Tokyo.
Influence on share prices and volume in Tokyo came mainly from the
United States, he said.
   Investors are ``cautious'' waiting for the release of the U.S.
consumer price index today, and the revised gross national product
figure for April-June on Thursday,'' Shimoyama said. Tokyo trading
``is up to what happens in New York.''
   On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency opened at
133.75 and moved in a narrow range of 133.75-134.00 yen before
finishing at 133.93, up 0.05 yen from Monday's close.
   Notable movement in the currency market is also unlikely ahead
of the scheduled release of the two U.S. reports this week,
exchange dealers said.

<HEAD>Drain on Wheat Stockpile Could Ease Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next year could bring a leveling off of the
massive drain on the U.S. wheat stockpile if the drought eases and
farmers expand plantings as expected, says the Agriculture
Department.
   The department's Economic Research Service says the total wheat
supply for the 1988-89 marketing year that began June 1 is about
3.1 billion bushels, down more than 20 percent from last season and
the lowest in almost a decade.
   More than 22 million acres of wheat land were idled under the
USDA's acreage program this year when farmers were required to set
aside 27.5 percent of their base acres. For 1989, they have to idle
only 10 percent.
   ``With increased area and average yields in 1989-90, the United
States would be able to produce 2.5 billion bushels of wheat,
enough to cover likely use without a further stock decline,'' the
report said Monday.
   Although the supply _ this year's harvest plus excess left over
from previous crops _ will be more than enough to meet expected
use, the wheat inventory by next June 1 is expected to be around
597 million bushels, down from 1.266 billion bushels this June 1.
   Based on the current rate of wheat use for domestic consumption
and exports, the U.S. wheat supply next June 1 would represent an
87-day supply, compared with reserves for 185 days this June 1. It
also would be the smallest since 1973-74.
   This year's wheat harvest of 1.82 billion bushels is far short
of the more than 2.5 billion bushels needed to cover expected
domestic and export demands in 1988-89. The shortfall of 684
million bushels has to come out of reserves.
   Thus, according to the report, the beginning inventory of 1.266
billion bushels is drawn down by the shortfall to 582 million
bushels. When imports of 15 million bushels are added, the
projected U.S. wheat stockpile next June 1 becomes 597 million
bushels.
   ``Largely due to drought, hard red spring (HRS) wheat production
is forecast to decline 56 percent in 1988 to 188 million bushels,''
the report said. ``However, indications are that HRS and durum crop
quality is higher than expected, and protein content is rated
high.''
   Drought struck HRS and durum wheat areas in the northern plains,
including the Dakotas, severely this year.
   ``Hard red winter (HRW) production in 1988 is an estimated 894
million bushels, down 12 percent from a year earlier, as area and
yields are forecast lower,'' the report said. ``In contrast, soft
red winter (SRW) production is up 33 percent in 1988, as area and
yield increased.''
   The report said some farmers in the SRW areas do not participate
in the government's wheat program and had stopped planting when
prices dropped in the mid-1980s. However, last fall prices began to
rise, and growers expanded plantings.

   Agriculture Department officials are advising
farmers who suffered drought damage to consider enrolling highly
erodible cropland in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   The current signup period for the CRP will end Aug. 31. More
than 25.5 million acres have been enrolled in previous signups, and
the goal is to have 40 million to 45 million acres in the program
by the end of 1990.
   Under the program, farmers offer bids to take land from crop
production and plant it to grass or trees for 10 years as a guard
against erosion. In return, they get federal assistance to pay for
up to half of the cost of establishing the protective cover, plus
annual rental payments for the CRP land.
   Vern Neppl, acting executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Monday that farmers may bid to enroll
eligible land that has not been harvested in 1988 due to drought.
   ``If their bids are accepted, the producers will receive their
first CRP rental payments in 1988,'' Neppl said. ``Also, they will
be guaranteed payments for nine more years, an additional source of
income regardless of weather condition during those years.''
   Cropland that has been hayed in counties approved for drought
relief is eligible for the CRP if it meets program requirements,
but there may be a reduction in the 1988 payment, Neppl said.
Producers also have the option of enrolling land for 1989.
   Enrollment of erodible land in the CRP will help farmers meet
the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law, Neppl said. Those
require producers to have an approved conservation plan for
erodible land in place by Jan. 1, 1990, to remain eligible for USDA
program benefits.

   The Agriculture Department will hold a public
hearing next month in Georgia to explore the possibility of setting
up a grower-financed program for researching and promoting Vidalia
onions.
   Officials said Monday that a Vidalia onion producer group
representing 19 southeast Georgia counties believes the program is
needed ``to distinguish the Vidalia onion in the marketplace, and
by finding more efficient ways to produce, distribute and store
their onions.''
   Enthusiasts say the Vidalia onion has no peer when it comes to
sweetness and munchiness, but growers in some other parts of the
nation contend their onions are just as sweet and munchy.
   The USDA said the hearing will be Sept. 20 in Lyons, Ga. Further
information can be obtained from John R. Toth, Southeast Marketing
Field Office, USDA, 500 3rd St. N.W., Winter Haven, Fla. 33881.

   The steepest grocery store increases in 4{
years pushed consumer prices up 0.4 percent in July as the effects
of the summer-long drought reached consumers, the government said
today.
   The 1.4 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 9.6
percent jump in egg costs, a 7.4 percent boost in poultry costs and
a 4.7 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables.
   July's overall gain, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount
to a yearly inflation rate of 5.2 percent.
   The department noted in today's announcement that the food price
gains ``reflect rising input prices, at least partially due to the
adverse summer weather,'' and showed that, except for food, price
gains were moderate.
   Excluding food and energy costs, consumer prices rose 0.3
percent last month, slightly less than the average monthly increase
posted in the first half of 1988.
   Energy costs were up 0.3 percent, largely due to a 0.7 percent
increase in gasoline prices. Still, gasoline is slightly cheaper
than in December and 28.1 percent under its price peak of March
1981.
   Housing costs rose at a 0.3 percent pace for the sixth straight
month as declines in home heating oil and electricity costs offset
higher charges for natural gas.
   Clothing prices dropped 0.6 percent after falling 0.3 percent in
June; those prices had risen 3.8 percent in the first five months
of 1988.
   The Labor Department said that larger than usual end-of-season
price reductions in women's clothing were responsible for most of
the declines.
   Medical care costs jumped 0.7 percent to a level 6.6 percent
above where they had been a year ago. Hospital expenses were up 1.0
percent while the cost of prescription and over-the-counter drugs
gained 0.9 percent.
   Transportation expenses rose 0.4 percent after a 0.2 percent
rise in June. The higher gasoline prices were largely to blame.
   New car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costs
gained 0.2 percent. Used car prices were up 0.5 percent _ their
second consecutive increase _ but were still below their level at
the end of 1987.
   Tobacco prices were up 2.7 percent, the steepest gain for any
major segment of the monthly price compilation.
   Despite the food price increase, meat costs overall declined
slightly as pork prices dropped 2.2 percent and beef and veal
prices rose just 0.1 percent as farmers trimmed herds.
   Cereal and bakery product prices gained 1.1 percent while
cooking oil posted a 1.0 percent price increase.
   Food costs overall rose 1.0 percent for the month as slower
advances of 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, were posted
for restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages.
   The July increases brought the consumer price index to 118.5,
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982
would have cost $118.50 last month, 50 cents more than in June and
$4.70 more than a year ago.
   The Reagan administration, labor unions and major business
groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ contrary to the
Federal Reserve Board _ all maintain that inflation remains under
control and that any one-month rise in consumer prices poses no
problem.
   The Federal Reserve earlier this month boosted its discount
rate, the interest it charges for overnight loans to banks, from
6.0 percent to 6.5 percent, out of concerns that inflation was
beginning to gain a toehold on the economy.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co. of New York,
said a 0.5 percent increase in wholesale prices last month should
be taken as a ``red flag of warning'' that the U.S. economy is on a
much higher inflation curve than the 4 percent to 5 percent that
had been forecast for this year.
   ``The behavior of wages, tightness of labor markets,
increasingly tighter product markets and running out of slack
between potential and actual output all suggest a higher range of
inflation as an ongoing reality,'' he said.
   Because of that, Sinai and other pessimists on the inflation
front said the Federal Reserve can be expected to ``lean'' toward
raising interest rates again after boosting them half a percentage
point earlier this month, but not necessarily before the November
election.
   Other analysts, however, agree with the administration and
business and labor groups that inflation remains under control.
   Michael Evans, who runs an economic forecasting firm in
Washington, said most analysts were ``spooked'' by the July
increase in wholesale prices.
   ``In spite of what you may read in the headlines about the
negative effects of the drought, too many people working or too
much being produced ..., inflation expectations have returned to
normal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Oregon Magazine has been sold to the
publisher of Seattle-based Pacific Northwest, a monthly magazine,
and the two publications will be merged immediately, company
officials announced.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed with the announcement
Monday.
   Portland-based New Oregon Publishers Inc., publisher of Oregon
Magazine, said in a news release that the bi-monthly magazine's
July-August issue was its last.
   New Oregon Publishers is owned by Win McCormack, who created
Oregon Magazine from Oregon Times, a newsprint monthly, after he
bought that publication in 1975.
   Pacific Northwest Media Inc., publisher of Pacific Northwest,
said it would not continue Oregon Magazine as a separate
publication.
   Subscribers to Oregon Magazine will receive Pacific Northwest
instead or can request a refund of their remaining subscription,
said Peter Potterfield, editor and publisher of Pacific Northwest.
   McCormack said one of the primary reasons for the sale was to
raise money to finance and expand his company's special
publications division, which publishes special-event programs,
guides and catalogs.
   ``We believe that special, highly focused publications of this
nature are a more sensible and lucrative way to publish in this
particular marketplace, and that periodical magazine publishing is
better done over a wider geographic area than the state of Oregon
encompasses by itself,'' McCormack said.

<HEAD>Law On Suspicious Trading Takes Effect In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An article of Japan's recently revised Securities
and Exchange Law broadening the Ministry of Finance's powers to
investigate suspicious trading took effect Tuesday.
   Article 154 of the new law empowers the ministry to directly
query companies listed on Japan's stock exchanges in its
investigations of suspicious trading. Until now, the ministry has
only been able to gather information from the exchanges.
   Along with Article 154, changes in securities law permitting
trading of cash-settled index futures and options were put into
effect Tuesday.
   Reports in the Japanese press speculated that Article 154 was
put into effect ahead of schedule in response to the public outcry
over the shady dealings, and possibly insider trading, which came
to light in two recent stock trading scandals.
   ``There have been reports all over that enforcement of this part
of the law was moved foward, but these are all mistakes,'' said a
spokesman at the ministry's securities division.
   Both the ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are investigating
unusual trading in shares of Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co. ahead
of the official announcement of a deal between Sankyo Seikei and
Nippon Steel Corp., which sent Sankyo Seikei shares sharply higher.
   The ministry enjoys wide discretion in the timing of enforcement
of new securities law. Reports surfaced in recent weeks that the
ministry might speed enforcement of some portions of the new
securities law.
   Article 154 does not extend the ministry's reach in its
investigations to companies whose shares are listed for
over-the-counter trading, as those of Recruit Cosmos, the center of
attention in the other of the two recent scandals.
   Aides to a number of prominent politicians, and public figures
including journalists, were found to have been allowed to buy
shares of Recruit Cosmos before the shares were listed to trade
over the counter. The shares surged in value after the registration.

<TEXT>
   Britain's economy grew at a faster-than-expected
1.3 percent in the second quarter, the government said Tuesday.
   The country's inflation-adjusted gross domestic product,
measured by total output of goods and services, rose 5.1 percent
from the second quarter of 1987, the Central Statistics Office said.
   The GDP index, which uses a 1980 base of 100, rose to a
seasonally-adjusted 124.3 in the second quarter from a revised
122.7 in the first quarter and 118.2 in the second quarter of 1987,
the office said said.
   The first-quarter index was previously reported as 122.5.
   The markets had expected a 1 percent rise in the second quarter.
   Output in the manufacturing sector grew 1.6 percent in the
latest period, while service sector output grew 1.7 percent, the
office said.
   The index is considered the most reliable guide to short-term
movements in the economy.
   Britain also calculates GDP based on expenditure as well as on
income data and publishes an average estimate of the three GDP
measures, which is considered the best guide to long-term movements
in the economy.
   The office is due to report the average estimate of GDP for the
second quarter in September.

<HEAD>Consumer Price Rise, Durable Goods Orders Fall in July</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 8 new grafs with reports on consumer prices and
durable goods. Picks up 2nd graf pvs, The Dow ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in July while durable goods
orders plunged 7 percent, the biggest drop in four years, the
government said today in reports that cooled fears of inflation.
   In the credit markets, bond prices moved higher after the
reports were released, sending their yields lower. Traders bought
bonds out of confidence that their value would not be eroded by
surging inflation.
   The rise in consumer prices was fueled by a 1.4 percent rise in
prices at grocery stores, the steepest one-month rise in that
category in 4{ years, according to the Labor Department report.
   July's overall gain, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount
to a yearly inflation rate of 5.2 percent.
   The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said total orders for
durable goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $116.6 billion last
month, primarily because of a huge decline in orders for cars,
aircraft and ships and tanks.
   It was the biggest decline in orders for durable goods since a
7.2 percent drop in April 1984. In June, orders had risen at the
fastest pace in more than six years, climbing by 8.7 percent.
   Prices of the widely followed 30-year Treasury bond were up
about $6 for every $1,000 in face value while their yields slipped
to 9.38 percent from 9.45 percent late Monday.
   Speculation about higher interest rates had weighed on the
financial markets on Monday, pushing stock prices lower and bond
prices lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 25.78 to
1,990.22 on Monday, its first close below 2,000 in nearly three
months.
   Bond prices fell, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond rising to 9.45 percent from 9.39 percent late in
Friday's session.
   ``This is very nervous trading,'' Jack Baker, head of block
trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said of Monday's action.
``This isn't the kind of market that's going to bring people off
the sidelines.''
   The Dow Jones close Monday was its lowest since it finished at
1,956.44 on May 27, the day before the three-day Memorial Day
holiday. When traders returned May 31, the Dow climbed 74.68 points.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The economy has been growing at such a strong pace that the
Federal Reserve boosted its rate on loans to member banks by a half
percentage point to 6.5 percent earlier this month in a bid to curb
inflation.
   Monday's trading was characterized by indecision, analysts said.
Traders searching for clues to the economy's direction looked ahead
to today's report on consumer prices and Thursday's revised
estimate of second-quarter economic growth.

Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Houston officials were poised today
to announce an agreement with Du Pont Co. for commercial
development of the superconductivity discoveries of physicist Paul
Chu.
   University of Houston officials declined to give details of the
licensing agreement until it was announced at a press conference
today at the University of Houston.
   But University of Houston spokesman Eric Miller said the pact
will mean ``several million dollars'' for the university in
licensing fees for a superconducting material Chu's team discovered
in 1986. He said future royalties would bring still more income to
the school.
   Chu said he is pleased with the deal, which reportedly could
lead to commercial products using the material within three to five
years.
   ``I think it's really great,'' said Chu, who, along with his
research team, is considered a leader in the the intense
competition to develop a superconductor that works at or near room
temperature.
   The agreement ends more than a year of negotiations with Du Pont
and other firms interested in commercializing the physicist's
discoveries.
   Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity without
resistance and repel magnetic fields. The working temperature of
the new material is high enough to allow the use of cheap, readily
available liquid nitrogen as a coolant. Until that discovery,
superconductivity could be achieved only with liquid helium, which
is colder but more expensive.
   A superconducting material that works at or near room
temperature would hold the promise of major advances in the
production and use of electricity, more powerful magnets and
motors, more sensitive medical equipment and more powerful beams
for smashing atoms.
   University Counsel Scott Chafin earlier this summer said faculty
research guidelines at the time of Chu's discoveries called for a
50-50 split of profits between Chu and the university, adding that
any agreement between Chu and fellow researchers to divide profits
is private.
   Chafin said the University of Houston administration wanted the
licensing agreement to go to a U.S. company.

   A federal judge has ruled a former Duff & Phelps
Inc. executive is entitled to nearly $1 million in damages because
he was denied stock privileges enjoyed by a fellow executive.
   U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall said Monday that Paul Much
``was not dealt with honestly or fairly'' because he was forced by
the company to sell back his Duff & Phelps stock in 1983 when he
quit for another job.
   Much had charged in his lawsuit that at the same time he was
leaving the company, the Duff & Phelps board permitted another
employee, Carol Franchik, to keep her stock after she was fired for
having an affair with the firm's chairman Claire Hansen.
   On Nov. 29, 1983, Much sold back his 485 shares of stock in the
privately held firm for $59,910.
   Ms. Franchik, however, kept her stock until the company was
sold, then divested her 300 shares for a $600,000 profit.
   Marshall said Hansen allowed Ms. Franchik to keep her stock
because she had threatened to bring a ``potentially valuable gender
discrimination case against them.''

<HEAD>Coal Association Official Addresses Legislators</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States should not be hindered
in adopting an energy policy encouraging the use of coal because of
concerns about the ``greenhouse effect'' and acid rain, the
president of the National Coal Association said.
   Richard Lawson made his remarks while addressing a session
Monday on energy and the environment at the Southern Legislative
Conference, a gathering of about 2,000 lawmakers from 15 states and
Puerto Rico.
   ``It's time to quit treating energy as just another market
item,'' he said. ``You'll never need air cover or a TOW (missile)
to get a unit train (of coal) to a generating station.''
   The lack of a national energy policy forces the United States to
bend its foreign and military policies to protect its sources of
imported oil, making the true cost of that oil much higher than the
market price, said Lawson, a retired Air Force general.
   Although he has headed the coal group for just over a year,
Lawson said, ``I do know security and I do understand strategy, and
I sense the vulnerability of our country in that area is
increasing.''
   Estimates of domestic oil and gas reserves have declined
recently, he said, while use of imported oil is greater now than in
1973, the date of the first Arab oil embargo.
   Lawson said the nation should reduce its use of imported oil to
the point that a price increase or cutoff would not be catastrophic.
   He said the country also should offer incentives for
conservation and development of domestic supplies, expand its use
of coal, finance more research and development of technology to
burn coal more cleanly, and develop synthetic fuels for use when
the market makes them economically feasible.
   He estimated that such a program, beginning in 1990, would cost
$3 billion to $4 billion a year.
   The unusually hot weather this summer and this decade has raised
concern about the ``greenhouse effect,'' in which carbon dioxide
from burning of fossil fuels reduces the heat that is radiated into
space.
   Although the issue should not be ignored, Lawson said, few
scientists believe the climate is already getting hotter because of
the effect.
   ``A lot of imaginations are going in and out of focus,
especially on Capitol Hill,'' he said.
   Lawson said the greenhouse issue has been ``folded into'' the
debate on acid rain, which is caused when emissions from
coal-burning plants react with other chemicals and water vapor in
the atmosphere.
   Congress, he contended, should reject a pending
acid-rain-control bill to allow time for development of clean-coal
technology, partly because acid rain is declining even though the
use of coal has increased.

   Stock prices drifted lower in light trading
today after a big decline in the previous session.
   Market analysts said a pair of new economic reports showing a
rise in consumer prices in July and a decline in durable goods
orders had been largely anticipated, and failed to provide much
direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell to its
lowest level in nearly three months on Monday, was off 1.78 at
1,988.44 after 30 minutes of trading today.
   Declining issues took a narrow lead over gainers on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 400 up, 453 down and 563 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 22.63 million shares at 10 a.m. on
Wall Street, compared with 20.49 million shares at the same point

   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported consumer
prices rose 0.4 percent in July and the Commerce Department said
orders for durable goods fell 7 percent.
   An hour after the reports were released, prices were higher in
the bond market, where traders have been wary for the past few
weeks of signs of accelerating inflation combined with economic
strength.
   The prices of the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond was up
about $6 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield fell to 9.38
percent from 9.45 percent late Monday.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today signed landmark
trade legislation and told an audience at this bustling West Coast
port the new law will keep America riding on a ``global wae'' of
prosperity.
   He said he was signing the bill despite misgivings over some of
its provisions.
   ``We're here to sign a piece of legislation that will help our
economy continue to grow and compete,'' Reagan said in remarks
prepared for a signing ceremony at the Port of Long Beach, one of
the world's 10 busiest computerized cargo ports.
   Port officials say 60.6 million metric tons of cargo crossed
Long Beach piers last year, the most ever recorded at a West Coast
port.
   The legislation authorizes U.S. participation in current world
trade talks, streamlines procedures for retaliatory import curbs
against unfair trade practices and makes many other changes in
trade laws.
   ``Our administration and Congress have come together in an
effort to ensure open markets around the world,'' Reagan said. ``It
hasn't been easy, but I have never doubted our ultimate victory,
because we're riding a global wave.
   ``Country after country is recognizing that free trade is the
key to a more prosperous future and that protectionism protects no
one, not even the special interests that want it so much.''
   Reagan, who had objected to what he said were protectionist
features in earlier versions of the legislation, said there are
still ``some things in this bill I don't like.''
   He said the law could lead to an import fee that would be
illegal under international law and ``inconsistent with our goal of
moving toward free world trade.''
   He said the bill also appears to require exeutive branch
officers to negotiate with foreign countries on specified trade
topics, which he argued is ``inconsistent with our constitutional
principles.''
   He also objected that the bill purports to require the
International Trade Commission to conduct investigations in
response to a resolution passed by just one House or Senate
committee.
   ``And so, in signing this bill I am specifically noting that it
will be implemented in a constitutional manner,'' the president
said.
   The signing climaxes months of negotiation between the
administration and Congress over the bill, which Reagan vetoed when
it was first sent to him because it contained a provision requiring
a 60-day notice to employees of plant closings and layoffs.
   Congress, however, promptly passed the advance-notice provision
as a separate bill, and Reagan _ trying to minimize its importance
as a Democratic election-year issue _ then let it become law
without his signature.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and his party's vice presidential
candidate, said over the weekend that the administration had
resisted the plan ``every inch of the way.''
   Bentsen, the Texas senator who was the bill's prime sponsor,
said in a radio speech that ``this administration has been a
reluctant partner. They have clung stubbornly to the status quo,
ignored the mounting deficits and resisted a trade policy every
inch of the way.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked whether Bentsen's
key role on the bill put the president in an awkward position,
replied, ``Bentsen did a good job on this. He worked on it a lot of
years and so did we. And everybody who worked on it gets credit.''
   The bill authorizes U.S. negotiators to reach agreements in
international trade talks, streamlines the system of import curbs
to protect American business and provides for retraining of those
left jobless by foreign competition. It also contains a potential
$2.5 billion in export subsidies for agricultural products and
repeals the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry earnings,
which has not produced any revenue since oil prices plunged three
years ago.
   Another provision allows the United States to retaliate against
countries that do not abide by international agreements on workers'
rights. AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Monday he would ask
the administration to invoke this provision against Poland, where
the government ordered troops to secure major industrial plants and
clamped curfews on three provinces hit by strikes in favor of the
outlawed union movement Solidarity.
   From Long Beach, the president was going to Irvine to speak to a
crowd expected to number 800 to 900 at a $500-a-plate fund-raising
luncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   While in Los Angeles, the president plans to have private
dinners with old friends and see his eye doctor and ear, nose and
throat specialist, as he does annually during his late-summer
California vacation.
   First lady Nancy Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said
Mrs. Reagan would pay a call on decorators at the home in the Bel
Air section of Los Angeles where the Reagans plan to live after he
leaves office Jan. 20.

   Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. confirmed
Tuesday that it dismissed five top executives in an effort to
reduce costs in its public finance division.
   Among those let go were four managing directors and a vice
president, but a company official noted that 110 employees remain
in the public finance department.
   ``In the context of the business environment, the firm is
attempting to reduce its overhead in this particular division,''
said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Faced with dwindling returns in their municipal bond
departments, a number of Wall Street firms abandoned the business
over the past year, including Salomon Brothers Inc. and L.F.
Rothschild Holdings Inc.
   Despite fewer players in the business, Smith Barney has seen its
ranking slip this year. According to IDD Information Services Inc.,
Smith Barney has underwritten $4.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds for
a 7.1 percent share of the market so far this year.
   But compared with a year ago when the firm ranked as the No. 2
underwriter of new issues, Smith Barney has slipped to fifth place.
   The firm's share of the taxable market also slipped. According
to IDD, Smith Barney has arranged $24.5 million in new issues so
far this year with a 3.2 percent share of the market. A year ago,
however, the company managed $58.7 million in new issues for a 4.3
percent share of the market.
   Smith Barney was acquired last year by Primerica Corp. for $750
million. Primerica partly attributed its flat second-quarter
earnings to declining commissions, underwriting and trading revenue
from Smith Barney.
   Among those dismissed were Edward Tirrel, Oscar Carlson, Michael
Cherry and James Williams, all managing directors, and J. Dale
Lehman, a vice president.

1,996.98 after 90 minutes of trading.
   But declining issues held a narrow lead over gainers on the New

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range
today, with blue-chip issues posting some modest gains while the
broader market was mixed.
   Trading was sluggish.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 25.78 points
on Monday to its lowest level since late May, was up 5.87 at
1,996.09 at noontime.
   But declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 6 to 5 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 543 up, 659 down and 582
unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 62.63 million shares at noon on
Wall Street, compared with 61.64 million shares at the same point
on Monday.
   Market analysts said a pair of new economic reports showing a
rise in consumer prices in July and a decline in durable goods
orders had been largely anticipated, and failed to provide traders
with much direction.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported consumer
prices rose 0.4 percent in July and the Commerce Department said
orders for durable goods fell 7 percent in the same month.
   The reports sparked a mild rally in the bond market, where
traders have been wary for the past few weeks of signs of
accelerating inflation combined with economic strength.
   By midday, the prices of the closely-watched 30-year Treasury
bond was up about $6 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield
fell to 9.38 percent from 9.45 percent late Monday.
   Tom Fogarty, director of institutional equity sales at Nomura
Securities International Inc., said the economic figures were
``right at what people expected.''
   But Fogarty said the light volume reflected the market's lack of
conviction about the direction of the economy and interest rates.
   ``Everyone is at the beach,'' he said. ``There is no momentum on
the upside or on the downside.''

<TEXT>
   Banking employees will begin a five-day work week
starting next year, government and banking officials announced
Tuesday.
   The move, scheduled to take effect in February, is consistent
with broader official efforts to encourage corporations maintaining
a six-day work week and relying on Saturday banking services to
close their doors.
   The extra employee day off is expected to boost consumer
spending and fuel the country's shift away from dependence on
exports for growth, officials said. The announcement by the Posts
and Telecommunications Ministry and the Federation of Bankers'
Associations of Japan will terminate Saturday hours for branches of
the nation's $86 billion postal savings system.
   It also will limit banking activities to cash dispensing and
automatic teller machines at the association's 87 member banks,
which make up virtually all of Japan's regular banking institutions.
   Japan's banks currently close on the second and third Saturdays
of the month. They are open until noon on the first, fourth and
fifth Saturdays of the month.
   Securities and other industry representatives have endorsed the
Tuesday announcement and are expected to follow suit.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade with fresh export business supporting
the corn and wheat markets while wetter, cooler weather pressured
soybean prices.
   Morocco, South Korea, Taiwan and Tunisia all had tender offers
pending for U.S. corn this morning, and Indonesia and Tunisia were
awaiting responses to their wheat bids, analysts said.
   But foreign demand for U.S. soybean products remained flat.
   ``The soybean market is still trying to find some sort of demand
out there,'' said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``The U.S. soybean
oil market is overpriced and there's still a lot of soybean meal
supply in the Southern Hemisphere.''
   The arrival of cooler, wetter weather in the Midwest was seen as
helping the soybean crop. But cool temperatures were considered
deterimental to the corn crop, which is rapidly maturing.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.84 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 2{ cents higher with September at $2.79 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 4\ cents higher with September at $2.49 a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 3 cents higher with September at

   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October
at 70.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent
lower with August at 81.40 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .70

<HEAD>Deere More Than Triples Earnings in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm machinery-maker Deere & Co. more than
tripled its earnings and increased sales 16 percent in the third
quarter of 1988, despite the drought gripping much of the Farm
Belt, the company reported today.
   Deere, based in Moline, reported net earnings of $81 million, or
$1.14 per share, up from $25.5 million, or 38 cents per share, for
the three-month period ending July 31.
   Sales for the quarter were $1.39 billion vs. year-earlier sales
of $1.19 billion for the period.
   ``Our increased profitability is due primarily to higher sales
and production volumes, some improvement in price realization and
greater efficiencies in our worldwide operations,'' Deere Chairman
Robert A. Hanson said in a news release.
   ``However, higher prices for some raw materials are partially
offsetting these improvements.''
   Hanson said it was hard to predict the impact of the drought on
Deere's earnings performance. Although crop yields are down, the
prices for farm products has risen and commodity reserves are
dropping.
   ``Retail sales of our agricultural and lawn-and-grounds-care
equipment were lower in the latter part of the quarter,'' he said.
``We believe continuing dry weather could affect retail demand in
some areas during the remainder of the year.
   Deere's earnings for the first nine months of its fiscal year
totaled $234.9 million or $3.25 a share, vs. a net loss of $131.7
million during the same period of 1987, a strike-marred year. Sales
for the first three quarters were $3.88 billion, a 38 percent jump
over last year's sales of $2.8 billion.

<HEAD>Bob Kemp: Premier Builder of Parade Balloons</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE FITZHENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GLEN BURNIE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Kemp remembers when he was a novice
businessman and needed a loan. He listed Chicken Licken, Goosy
Loosy and Ducky Lucky as collateral.
   He got the money after explaining that the animals were the
parade balloons on which he planned to build his company, Kemp
Balloons Inc.
   ``I told them that's what makes the money for me,'' said Kemp.
``It was survival at that point. We'd only been in business a
couple of years.''
   The turning point was President Carter's inauguration, which was
12 days away when the call came asking for a giant, inflatable
peanut.
   ``We said, `If the peanut's there, pay us. If not, forget it.'
We made it in 12 days,'' Kemp said.
   That accomplishment and the ensuing publicity launched the
company's reputation as a premier builder of parade balloons.
Kemp's cast of more than 50 characters includes Popeye the Sailor
Man and his wife, Olive Oyl, the Pillsbury Dough Boy Poppin' Fresh,
Woody Woodpecker and Felix the Cat.
   His colorful creations meander parade routes across the country
and around the world, including the Tournament of Roses parade, the
Orange Bowl, the Indianapolis 500 and other major festivals.
   ``It's fun. It's like being on the fringe of show business,''
said the affable Kemp, 57.
   On the paint-splattered floor of Kemp's suburban Baltimore
warehouse, Humpty Dumpty sits in a corner with a perpetual grin on
his massive face and Popeye's head occupies much of the opposite
side of the room. Various pieces of other characters wait for a
fresh coat of paint or a call from a promoter who wants to hire a
balloon.
   ``We've done a lot of exciting things,'' said Kemp.
   Don Lunday, the executive director of the International
Festivals Association in Pasadena, Calif., an organization of
festival promoters and suppliers, says Kemp Balloons is one of the
oldest and largest balloon makers.
   ``There's a quality about Bob's, but the fact remains he is
expensive. You can rent cheaper inflatables. But the odds are they
are not going to do what Bob's do,'' Lunday said.
   Kemp's balloons rent from $500 to $11,000, depending on the
character and the season. Prices go higher during holiday periods.
   ``There are other balloon makers, but I haven't come across
anyone who has the balloons Bob has and the quality he has,'' said
Jo Hauck, executive director of the Indianapolis 500 Festival
Associates Inc., a civic organization that stages festivities
leading up to the big auto race.
   ``His Felix the Cat has one arm that waves to everybody. The
kids just go wild,'' said Hauck.
   Kemp built his first balloons in 1973 for Gimbel's Thanksgiving
parade in Philadelphia and made many of the balloons used in Macy's
legendary parades.
   This year, Kemp expects sales to top $1 million _ a long way for
a man who says he learned how to starve while employed as a social
worker. He's also taught ballroom dancing, sold cars, promoted wine
in California and was director of tourism for the city of Baltimore.
   Kemp employs about 10 fulltime workers and as many as 30 during
a busy period. His son, Bobby, is the chief designer. Once the
design is created, a pattern is traced on long sheets of black
rubber. The pieces are cut and sewn together, then inflated and
painted.
   When his balloons leave the warehouse, any number of things can
happen. Popeye, for instance, was mistakenly taken off a plane in
Paris en route to a children's Passover festival in Israel.
   The balloon mysteriously arrived just in time for the festival,
but on the way home, it was seized briefly by Israeli customs
agents who questioned how it had entered the country.
   Here at home, it's not uncommon to see adults try to poke
Poppin' Fresh in the stomach to make him giggle like the character
does in television commercials. Since they can't reach that high,
spectators tickle his toes instead, Kemp says.
   Kemp refers to the dough boy as ``the little guy,'' despite his
height of 55 feet.
   Kemp's worst moment as a balloon man came during the Winter
Olympics in Calgary where he staged his most ambitious project _ an
inflatable Canadian Rockies that was 110 feet long, 55 feet wide
and 67 feet tall. Plans called for 25,000 smaller balloons to be
released from inside the mountains as two huge dinosaur balloons
cavorted in front of the spectators.
   High winds forced Kemp to abort the project only a few moments
after the mountains were inflated.
   ``They were asking me, `Bob, is this mountain going to work?' We
were calling the weather (service) every five minutes. It was my
decision,'' he said. ``The wind had died down. We had 300 people to
hold it down. We had people with knives (to deflate it if
necessary). We were prepared to immediately kill our balloon.
   ``The place went crazy when it went up. The wind hit and moved
it about 10 feet. That's when we murdered the mountains. After we
killed the mountain, they stood up and applauded and went crazy. It
was an emotional moment for everybody.''
   His next goal is the franchising of his business, which he hopes
will bring in enough money for his final project _ Balloon World, a
home for retired balloons.
   ``It would be a place where people can stop in and see a part of
history,'' Kemp said. ``These are things they grew up with and saw
on TV. They'd be retired there. It would have to be gigantic.
People could walk around and touch a 65-foot Popeye on the nose.''

<HEAD>INS Worries as Haitians Hail Work Permit Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singing, cheering Haitians gathered at a community
center Tuesday to celebrate a judge's ruling on work permits that
could eventually help 400,000 foreign-born farm workers nationwide.
   But federal immigration officials fretted that the decision to
relax permit requirements puts a heavy burden on their bureaucracy
and may foster more fraud in the program.
   Monday's ruling by Senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins
ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to rehear the
cases of 14,000 farm workers, most of them Haitians and Mexicans,
who had been turned down for agricultural work permits in Florida,
Georgia and Alabama.
   The judge found the INS was demanding excessive documentary
proof that the workers met legal requirements, and granted
temporary permits to most of those denied until their new hearings.
Without the permits, they faced expulsion.
   ``It has major national significance because the court has ruled
there is a constitutional right to file for farm worker status,''
said Ira Kurzban, the attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center,
which supported the suit. ``It will affect over 400,000 farm
workers around the nation.''
   While the decision applied only to three states, it can be used
as a precedent in similar suits elsewhere, he noted.
   Kurzban spoke after a rally at the refugee center in Little
Haiti, where 150 elated Haitians waved signs, listened to speeches,
celebrated, and sang in Creole.
   Atkins' ruling, said Kurzban, effectively shifts the burden of
proof away from the farm worker, as Congress intended, and makes
the INS prove an applicant is not eligible.
   The key issue was the requirement that farm workers prove they
toiled at least 90 days in the United States before a 1985 cutoff
date. The INS has recently demanded pay stubs and other documents,
refusing to accept affidavits alone.
   Now, Kurzban said, the INS must accept affidavits unless it can
prove they are false. The affidavits are necessary because many
workers were illegal at the time and were paid under the table,
Kurzban said.
   The Justice Department is deciding whether to appeal Atkins'
ruling, said Florida INS Director Perry Rivkind, who complained the
order to rehear rejected cases puts an impossible burden on his
agency.
   ``It will cost tremendous sums of money and will required added
man- and womanpower to be brought in here to do it,'' Rivkind said.
   Moreover, Rivkind said, the INS has already been granting
permits to 85 percent of the applicants, and was rejecting only
those it genuinely felt were not eligible. The new ruling makes it
harder to reject false applications, he said.
   ``Commmon sense would tell you it would attract fraud,'' said
Rivkind. ``People who just entered the United States come in and
tell us they worked here in 1985.''

<HEAD>Smith Worthington Saddle Makers Preserve Ways Of The Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN MILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1794, Norman Smith had a thriving
saddlery business not far from the open fields and untouched
woodlands of New England.
   Today, the Smith Worthington Saddlery Co., the oldest
continuously running saddlery company in the nation, operates a
stone's throw from the dilapidated buildings of Hartford's largely
poor and gritty North End.
   But while its surroundings have changed dramatically, Smith
Worthington does, in many ways, preserve the ways of the past,
still producing custom-made, English-style saddles by hand.
   Smith Worthington is ``a famous firm and still much respected,''
said James Hutchins, a historian at The Natural Museum of American
History in Washington, D.C.
   Hutchins is compiling two 19th-century Smith Worthington
catalogs into a book. ``Anyone who knows about saddlery knows about
Smith Worthington,'' he said.
   In its heyday during the 1800s, the firm had approximately 1,200
employees, filled several Hartford buildings and had branches in
New Orleans and New York.
   The staff has been whittled down over the years to seven,
including three saddle makers, and the business operates out of an
airy warehouse stacked with cardboard boxes full of the
paraphernalia of the horse world.
   It specialized in 1794 in sidesaddles for women, saddles
``calculated for both ease and beauty,'' according to an
advertisement.
   But with the advent of the automobile and mass production of
saddles, the company evolved into a specialized supplier of
English-style saddles and leather harnesses.
   In addition, Smith Worthington imports and distributes saddles
it makes in Walsall, England.
   The company was managed for 134 years by direct descendants of
founder Norman Smith. It passed in 1928 to a manager of the New
York City branch of the business, John Allen Roberts.
   The firm's name was so well established by the time Roberts took
over that it was a natural decision not to change it, said Curtis
C. Hanks, 42, the present owner, in a recent interview.
   Among the company's former clients are Victor Borge and the shah
of Iran, who made a special visit to Hartford in 1958 with four
members of the royal entourage to be fitted for saddles, bridles
and other equestrian equipment, said Curtis Hanks' father, Clinton
Hanks, 72, who sold the firm to his son.
   The younger Hanks, one of the company's three remaining saddle
makers, is a taciturn man who quickly becomes animated when he
talks about his craft.
   ``You put part of yourself in every saddle,'' said Curtis Hanks,
a West Hartford resident.
   Each saddle is individually measured to fit both horse and
rider, he said, because horses, like humans, come in all shapes and
sizes.
   ``It used to be that most people were riding a Morgan, an
Arabian or a thoroughbred and you could pretty much say, `I've got
a Morgan, therefore I need a Morgan fit for it,''' Curtis Hanks
said.
   But now crossbred horses are widespread and it is difficult to
estimate animals' proportions, he said.
   Smith Worthington today supplies saddles for several big-city
police forces, including Boston, New York and Hartford, as well as
jumping saddles used in international horse shows.
   Sgt. Donald Tadiello, supervisor of the Hartford police
equestrian unit, said the 12-horse unit uses 10 Smith Worthington
custom saddles.
   The saddles suit the special requirements of the police force,
Tadiello said. They are designed to be comfortable for both horse
and rider over extended periods of time and have extra fittings,
such as brass rings for saddle bags, ropes and night sticks.
   Smith Worthington saddles sell for $1,000 to $1,300 each. The
prices reflect the materials used in the saddles and the
labor-intensive nature of the business, Curtis Hanks said.
   It takes a week to make one saddle in a process that hardly uses
machines at all; many of the materials are imported, too, and take
time to obtain, he said.
   Moreover, the company's competitors are few, Curtis Hanks said.
Whitman Saddle Manufacturing in Kalamazoo, Mich., is the only other
English saddle maker in the U.S., he said.
   Although Smith Worthington mainly produces horse tackle, it also
makes harnesses and other leather products to order, Hanks said.
The company, for instance, has made harnesses for sled dog teams
and for circus animals.
   Smith Worthington also makes leather sandbags used by Pratt &
Whitney jet-engine makers as molds for shaping metal, Curtis Hanks
said.

<HEAD>Biting The Deficit Bullet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inability of finding easy ways to gloss over
the danger of federal budget deficits leaves the White House,
Congress and private sector advisory groups with no alternative but
to bite the bullet.
   Biting the bullet is an appropriate term in this context,
because it suggests the pain that soldiers endured when, in the
absence of options, a limb was surgically detached from their body
without comfort of anesthesia.
   There is no easy way out of the budget mess. Evidence of the
dilemma is seen in deficit-reducing ideas suggested. Included are a
lowering or elimination of the home mortgage deduction, and a tax
on Social Security.
   Congress already has been asked to consider reductions in the
mortgage interest deduction, and if you talk to certain real estate
and housing people you'll find them arming themselves against
attempts next year at elimination.
   To even consider such a drastic move against what is considered
a sacred right shows how painful and how extreme the matter is. To
homeowners, removal of their tax deductions is not just an affront
but an assault on a symbol.
   Perhaps even holier is the special tax treatment of Social
Security beneficiaries, but that too is under attack. A research
paper from the Tax Foundation, for example, suggests taxing 85
percent of benefits received.
   Should that occur, it would indeed demonstrate the painful
twists and turns involved in seeking tax dollars.
   In this instance, a wage-earner is taxed and the money sent to
Washington. It is then reallocated to a former wage-earner or other
recipient. There, it would be taxed again and resent to Washington
to pay for various federal burdens, perhaps to be resent later to
the now-retired wage-earner.
   This latest proposal to tax Social Security benefits comes from
the Tax Foundation's ``shadow budget committee,'' a group of
private citizens with experience in finance and public policy.
   The thrust of their proposal is that a substantial and permanent
reduction in the budget deficit is not just a goal but an
imperative, and that the time for action is immediately. Their
proposals illustrate how painful that will be.
   Urging a $100 billion cut from the unified budget deficit by
1993, they begin by recommending $25 billion in defense spending
cutbacks, a suggestion that can set off an immediate storm from the
defense-first advocates.
   Some $20 billion would be cut from nondefense subsidies, $18
billion from Social Security and $10 billion from ``restraints'' in
expenditures for entitlements. Total of cuts: $73 billion.
   The $100 billion goal would be exceeded by imposing a
broad-based tax on energy consumption, and adding in $10 billion in
user fees, or charges for the user of various federal services,
such as the Coast Guard.
   What proposals such as this suggest is that after two decades of
spending beyond their means, Americans must face reality, cut back
spending to the limits of national income and simultaenously pay
off debts.
   While all this is still in the discussion stage, the message is
likely to be interpreted by millions of Americans as something
worse than unbearable pain. Rather than biting the bullet, that is,
they may feel shot by it.

   The stock market turned mostly lower this
afternoon, as blue-chip issues gave up some earlier gains and the
broader market retreated.
   Trading slowed from Monday's sluggish pace.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 25.78 points
on Monday to its lowest level since late May, was down another 4.27
at 1,985.95 with one hour left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 8 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 539 up, 825 down and 553 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 99.08 million shares at 3 p.m. on
Wall Street, compared with 104.34 million shares at the same point
on Monday.
   Market analysts said a pair of new economic reports showing a
rise in consumer prices in July and a decline in durable goods
orders had been largely anticipated, and failed to provide traders
with much direction.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported consumer
prices rose 0.4 percent in July and the Commerce Department said
orders for durable goods fell 7 percent in the same month.
   The reports sparked a mild rally in the bond market, where
traders have been wary for the past few weeks of signs of
accelerating inflation combined with economic strength.
   By midafternoon, the prices of the closely-watched 30-year
Treasury bond was up about $6.25 for every $1,000 in face value, as
its yield fell to 9.38 percent from 9.45 percent late Monday.
   But stock prices failed to follow bonds higher.
   Among actively-traded issues on the NYSE, Knight Ridder was down
{ at 38[, Coca Cola was up ] at 38~, Clorox was up 1\ at 30} and

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to rain in the
Farm Belt. Corn also closed lower while wheat advanced on fresh
export demand.
   The Agriculture Department said soybeans suffered immense stress
in last week's heat wave, and private analysts predicted the USDA
would again lower its soybean production estimate in its Sept. 12
crop production report.
   But the market ignored those bullish factors and focused on
recent rain and cooler temperatures in the Midwest.
   ``It's looking pretty good for the beans,'' said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York. ``With the moisture that has come in, you're
getting some pretty good recovery yield reports.''
   Stronger export demand surfaced for both wheat and corn, but
corn futures retreated in sympathy with the soybeans, Loewy said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.86 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 4\ cents lower with September at $2.73 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.47{ a

   An Amoco gas station, a Case IH tractor, a Qume
printer and cars from Oldsmobile and Lamborghini are among the
products to be honored Wednesday as winners of industrial design
awards.
   Twelve designs out of 310 entries will receive the 1988
Industrial Design Excellence Award (IDEA) from the Industrial
Designers Society of America at ceremonies in New York.
   The designs are based on innovation, use of appropriate
materials, efficient production methods, benefits to the user and
client, and the appeal of the appearance.
   ``This year's IDEA winners underscore the fact that good design
is good business,'' Charles W. Pelly, the jury chairman, said in a
prepared statement.
   By the rules, all the products are on the market except those in
the categories of design explorations and student design projects.
   The designers society estimates more than $1 billion is spent
annually on industrial design services in the United States.
   Awards were given in 12 of the 13 eligible categories. No winner
was picked in the category of signs because there were fewer than
10 entries.
   Here are the winning entries, along with the clients for whom
the designs were done:
   _Products: Spacemaker Plus, an under-the-cabinet unit containing
a coffeemaker, can opener, knife sharpener and light, for Black &

<HEAD>Appeals Will Delay Payment of Dalkon Shield Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Appeals filed in the days before A.H.
Robins Co.'s bankruptcy reorganization was to take effect will
delay payments to many Dalkon Shield claimants, an attorney said
Tuesday.
   Three appeals to the plan had been filed as of Tuesday on behalf
of several hundred Dalkon Shield claimants. The deadline for
appealing is Thursday, one month after U.S. District Judge Robert
R. Merhige Jr. entered an order confirming the plan, which includes
a $2.5 billion trust fund for women claiming injuries from the
Dalkon Shield birth control device Robins sold.
   The reorganization plan, under which Robins is acquired by
American Home Products of New York, cannot take effect until the
appeals process has been exhausted. However, payments to some
claimants from a $100 million cash fund set up by Robins are
scheduled to begin despite the appeals. There are about 195,000
outstanding Dalkon Shield-related claims against the company.
   ``We appealed because we thought the judge was wrong and because
we thought our clients didn't get what they're entitled to,'' said
Alan B. Morrison, an attorney for the Public Citizen Litigation
Group in Washington, D.C. Morrison said he will be the lead counsel
for all the groups appealing.
   Morrison said his main points of appeal would be that the women
were not given all the facts about how their claims would be paid
when they voted on the reorganization plan, and that their votes
were not weighted in accordance with the size of their claims.
   About 95 percent of the Dalkon Shield claimants voted in favor
of the reorganization plan, according to ballots tallied last month
by Robins. Morrison said the women were told they would be ``paid
in full'' and the vote would have been different if they had a
better idea of what kind of payments they would receive.
   The appeals are ``ill-advised, misguided,'' and ``against the
interests of the vast majority of claimants,'' said Guerry
Thornton, an attorney for the Atlanta-based Dalkon Shield Victims
Assocation, which supported the plan. The 95 percent vote in favor
of the plan ``by itself takes away almost every objection,'' he
said. ``We've got the maximum amount that we can get as quickly as
we can get it.''
   Thornton said implementation of the plan may be delayed by as
much as two years during appeals to the 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, and suggested that interest
lost on the trust fund during that time might amount to as much as
$200 million.
   But Morrison called those figues `totally speculative'' and said
it would take some time for the trustees to begin making payments
even if the plan were not appealed. ``I don't think there's going
to be any significant delay,'' he said.
   Thornton said the appellants' claims had already been heard and
rejected by the court and said some attorneys were considering
asking for penalties against the appealing lawyers for filing
groundless appeals.
   A fourth appeal has been filed against a settlement, approved by
Merhige, of a class action suit filed against Aetna Casualty &
Surety Co., which insured Robins.
   Robins sought bankruptcy protection three years ago, after
paying about $530 million to settle 9,500 lawsuits stemming from
its sale of the IUD in the early 1970s.

   The stock market drifted lazily lower today,
with blue-chip issues outperforming the broader market.
   Market analysts said a pair of new economic reports showing a
rise in consumer prices in July and a decline in durable goods
orders had been largely anticipated, and failed to provide traders
with much direction.
   That left stock traders with many of the same concerns about
interest rates and the economy that have weighed on the market for
weeks.
   Before trading opened, the Labor Department reported consumer
prices rose 0.4 percent in July and the Commerce Department said
orders for durable goods fell 7 percent in the same month.
   The reports sparked a mild rally in the bond market, where
traders have been wary of signs of accelerating inflation combined
with economic strength.
   But stocks failed to muster as much enthusiasm as bonds did.
   ``The reports were in line with expectations, but it's not a
strong market. There are still a lot of remnants of selling
pressure. We are not out of the woods yet,'' said Charles Jensen, a
market analyst for MKI Securities Corp. in New York.

   USX Corp. announced a 9.5 percent increase in
tin mill prices Tuesday, effective Oct. 1.
   Tin-coated steel sheet is the prime packaging material for
canned food.
   The increase comes at a time when high prices for aluminum
sheet, the prime packaging material for canned soft drinks and
beer, have prompted beverage makers to consider steel packaging.
   Aluminum Co. of America, the nation's largest aluminum producer,
said it would maintain current prices through Dec. 31 on aluminum
used in beverage can bodies, ends and tabs.
   USX, the nation's largest steelmaker and historical price
leader, revealed the price move in announcing plans to invest $41
million to improve tin operations at its Gary Works near Chicago.
   Work has begun on equipment to more uniformly coat the steel
with tin and to improve the mill production capacity.

<HEAD>Most CEOs Believe Bush Would Raise Taxes, Survey Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of the chief executive officers of
the nation's largest corporations believe George Bush would raise
taxes if elected president, according to a survey released Tuesday
by Fortune magazine.
   The survey, which will appear in Fortune's Sept. 12 issue, was
taken just before the Republican Party convention began last week.
It polled 215 chief executive officers from the biggest U.S.
industrial and service companies.
   Bush has made his pledge not to raise taxes a central element of
the campaign.
   In the survey, however, 65 percent of the CEOs canvassed said
they believe Bush would raise taxes, while only 31 percent believe
he would not.
   Ninety-eight percent of the chief executives polled believe
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis would raise taxes
if elected.
   Many of the CEOs believe Bush would be less likely than Dukakis
to raise taxes on companies and affluent individuals, and they
suggest the Republican candidate could opt for consumption taxes
instead.
   Eighty-six percent of the CEOs said they will vote for Bush in
the November election, compared with 7 percent who plan to vote for
Dukakis.
   But the respondents said they weren't as confident as they were
in January that the Republicans would retain the White House. Fifty
percent now expect Bush to win, compared with 90 percent in
January, while 33 percent anticipate a Dukakis victory.
   Dukakis's alliances with Jesse Jackson to his left and Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen to his right are among the main reasons the
executives believe a Republican victory is now less certain, the
survey showed.

Superconductivity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Houston and Du Pont Co. on
Tuesday signed what officials said was a first-of-its-kind
agreement under which the company will license and commercialize
superconducting products and processes based on discoveries of
school researcher Paul Chu.
   The university receives an initial payment of $1.5 million under
the agreement. In addition, Du Pont will pay the school $1.5
million upon issuance to the university of a U.S. patent covering
the superconducting material developed by Chu, considered a world
leader in the field, and another $1.5 million two years after that
patent is issued.
   Richard L. Van Horn, university president, said the agreement
could be worth millions more to the school because of royalties
amounting to 50 percent on products of commercial interest to Du
Pont and 75 percent on products not of commercial interest.
   ``It's very hard to estimate,'' Van Horn said. ``It could be in
the area of $4 million or it could be the sky's the limit. It could
be $10 million or $20 million or more. It certainly will be in the
millions of dollars.''
   The money will go for further research at the university, he
said.
   Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity without
resistance and repel magnetic fields. Their use had been limited by
the need to cool them with liquid helium to minus 450 degrees
Fahrenheit, but Chu and his research team, who he referred to as
``unknown heroes,'' found a new superconductor that works at higher
temperatures.
   The temperature of the new material is high enough to allow the
use of cheap, readily available liquid nitrogen as a coolant. Until
that discovery, superconductivity could be achieved only with the
much scarcer liquid helium.
   A superconducting material that works at room temperature holds
the promise of major advances in the production and use of
electricity, more powerful magnets and motors, more sensitive
medical equipment and more powerful beams for smashing atoms.
   Constantine S. Nicandros, executive vice president of Du Pont
and president of Conoco Inc., a Du Pont subsidiary, said the
30-page agreement was better than a solid prospect on an oil well.
   ``We regard Paul Chu and the University of Houston as much more
of a blue chip investment than a gamble,'' Nicandros said.
   Chu, who under the standard university agreement stands to
personally gain half of the profits the school receives from
patents, said Du Pont's presence would enable the benefits of
discoveries in his laboratory to get more quickly into commercial
development.
   Officials of Du Pont and the University of Houston said it was
difficult to estimate when products may become commercially
available or what those products might be.

<TEXT>
   Onetime carpet cleaning ``whiz kid'' Barry
Minkow sat with his head resting on his hand Tuesday as a judge
outlined allegations of fraud and deception that prosecutors say
cost banks and investors more than $24 million.
   Two-hundred prospective jurors jammed the courtroom as U.S.
District Judge Dickran Tevrizian opened 22-year-old Minkow's
security fraud trial by reading the 57-count indictment against him.
   Minkow, who at age 15 began turning his after-school business
into a $100 million carpet cleaning empire, has asserted innocence.
He claims he was a victim of organized crime figures who
manipulated him and his business affairs.
   Minkow stands accused of multiple securities fraud, credit card
fraud and mail fraud counts. On trial with him is accountant Norman
Rothberg, accused of taking a bribe to retract his warnings to
others that ZZZZ Best was involved in fraud.
   Minkow was originally indicted with 12 others, 10 of whom have
since pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the alleged
fraud scheme.
   At the heart of the indictment is the charge that Minkow
fabricated building renovation deals to defraud investors. His ZZZZ
Best Co. actually did no renovation work, the indictment claims.
   Investors who handed over millions were taken on tours of phony
renovation sites, the document alleges.
   Jury candidates were given a questionnaire probing their
knowledge of the widely publicized case, their ability to be fair
and impartial and their willingness to serve on a trial expected to
last three months.
   Minkow, who has appeared at previous court hearings in prison
garb, wore a white pinstripe shirt and navy slacks to the opening
of his trial.
   David Kenner, attorney for Minkow, contends his client was
forced to stage the elaborate fraud scheme by organized crime
figures who allegedly wrested control of his business and silenced
him with threats.
   Minkow's youth combined with his apparent runaway success made
him famous. He was billed as the rags-to-riches American dream
incarnate and was said to have amassed more than $100 million by
age 21.
   Minkow, who remains in custody at Terminal Island federal
prison, has been described as a hard-driving, fast-talking boss who
had no patience with employees who dared to disagree with him.
   ``My way or the highway,'' was Minkow's pet motto, said
associates who added that he demanded they refer to him as Mr.
Minkow.
   His intensity on the job was blamed for causing him to develop a
bleeding ulcer by age 18. He once said he would build ZZZZ Best
into ``the General Motors of carpet cleaning.''
   But Minkow's empire collapsed in the summer of 1987 when
allegations of fraud and impending bankruptcy forced his
resignation from the company he started in a garage in the suburban
San Fernando Valley.
   ZZZZ Best filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within
days, and sued Minkow and four associates for more than $20 million
in allegedly misappropriated funds.

   Officials with the Birmingham Steel Corp. say
they are interested in buying the local USX Corp. steel plant that
has been idle for two years, if a deal to sell the mill to Iraq
doesn't go through.
   Birmingham Steel, based in Birmingham, Ala., and another
unidentified group offered to buy the plant for $115 million in a
deal for the building, property and equipment.
   Company officials said Iraq's offer of $100 million was for
plant and equipment. The Iraqis are interested in dismantling the
plant to be shipped home in pieces and reassembled.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, is opposing the Iraq deal, saying the
sale would reduce this country's steelmaking capabilities and
increase domestic steel prices.
   Fields said Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Abdul-Amir
al-Anbari, had told him a $1 million downpayment already had been
made to USX.
   The steel plant, which once employed 2,000, was shut down two
years ago.
   United Steelworkers union officials also expressed anger Monday
that USX is negotiating to sell the equipment to Iraq.

bushel Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to rain
and cooler weather in the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   Corn and oat futures also moved lower while wheat advanced.
   On other markets, cotton, coffee and energy futures fell
sharply; precious metals were mixed; livestock and meat futures
were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The Agriculture Department said soybeans suffered immense stress
in last week's heat wave, and private analysts predicted the USDA
would again lower its soybean production estimate in its Sept. 12
crop production report.
   But the market ignored those bullish factors and focused on
recent rain and cooler temperatures in the Midwest.
   ``It's looking pretty good for the beans,'' said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York. ``With the moisture that has come in, you're
getting some pretty good recovery yield reports.''
   Stronger export demand surfaced for both wheat and corn, but
most corn futures retreated in sympathy with the soybeans, Loewy
said.
   Demand for U.S. soybean products remained flat.
   ``The soybean market is still trying to find some sort of demand
out there,'' said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``The U.S. soybean
oil market is overpriced and there's still a lot of soybean meal
supply in the Southern Hemisphere.''
   Wheat settled unchanged to 5 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to
\ cent higher with September at $2.73} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.47{ a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents to 34 cents lower with September at $8.07 a
bushel.
   Cotton futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange
following the USDA's decision late Monday to revise the cotton
program to make U.S. cotton more competitive on the world market,
said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   The price support program has kept the price of U.S. cotton
significantly higher than that produced by other nations despite
abundant U.S. supplies.
   Cotton for October delivery traded down the 2-cents-a-pound
daily limit during the session but closed 1.80 cents lower at 50.50
cents a pound.
   Coffee futures prices plummeted near the close on mostly
technical factors in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand news,
analysts said.
   The coffee market has been volatile lately and likely will
remain so through Sept. 20, when the contract for September
delivery expires, said Kim Badenhop, an analyst in New York with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   ``Traders are having trouble trying to justify major moves in
either direction,'' he said. ``You get a run up and then everybody
sells and it just gets knocked on its rear end again.''
   The September contract settled 4.04 cents lower at $1.2122 a
pound.
   Oil futures prices declined in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid investor anticipation of higher oil
product inventories, analysts said.
   In a report issued after the close, the American Petroleum
Institute said that while stocks of gasoline and distillates rose
last week, crude oil inventories declined by nearly 4.3 million
barrels.
   Analysts had expected a buildup of 2 million to 4 million
barrels of crude, said John Azarow of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The API reported gasoline stocks were up 349,000 barrels and
distallate stocks rose 2.1 million barrels.
   Analysts also said the oil market declined on a report that
Saudi Arabia had exceeded its OPEC crude oil production quota
during the first three weeks of August.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 31 cents
lower with October at $15.70 a barrel; heating oil was .47 cent to
.79 cent lower with September at 44.03 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .18 cent to .34 cent lower with September at 47.18
cents a gallon.
   Gold futures fell slightly on New York's Commodity Exchange in
response to the drop in oil prices while silver was nearly
unchanged.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.50 lower with October at $436 a troy
ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.4 cent lower with September
unchanged at $6.74 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .25 cents lower with October at
70.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with August at 81.42 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower
to .57 cent higher with October at 40.37 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .57 cent lower to .70 cent higher with August at 36.95
cents a pound.
   Stock index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Merc, where
the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled .70 point higher at 257.30.

   The stock market finished about where it started
Tuesday after a listless session distinguished chiefly by one of
the lowest trading volumes of the year.
   The first of some widely-anticipated economic reports due for
release this week failed to inspire either buying or selling
pressure.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 25.78 points
on Monday to reach it lowest level in nearly three months, gave up
another 0.89 to close at 1,989.33. That is its lowest close since
it ended at 1,956.44 on May 27.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
552 issues up, 811 down and 580 unchanged. The NYSE index finished
unchanged at 145.94.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 119.54 million shares,
down from 122.25 million in the previous session and the lowest
since 113.4 million shares were traded on Aug. 5. There have only
been two other days this year when trading volume was lower than it
was Tuesday _ May 23, when it was 102.64 million shares, and June
20, when it was 116.75 million.
   ``Everyone is at the beach,'' said Tom Fogarty, director of
institutional equity sales at Nomura Securities International Inc.
``There is no momentum on the upside or on the downside.''
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 141.58 million shares on Tuesday.
   Market analysts said new economic reports showing a 0.4 percent
rise in consumer prices in July and a 7 percent decline in durable
goods orders had been largely anticipated, and failed to provide
traders with much direction.
   The reports sparked a mild rally in the bond market, where
traders have been vigilant for signs of accelerating inflation
coupled with economic vigor.
   The price of the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond was up
about $6 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield fell to 9.38
percent from 9.45 percent late Monday.
   Blue-chip stock prices drifted higher for much of the morning,
while the rest of the market was mixed. But by mid-afternoon, even
the blue-chips gave up their gains.
   Thomas Czech, chairman of the investment committee at the
brokerage Blunt Ellis & Loewi in Milwaukee, said in failing to
follow the bond market higher, the stock market demonstrated it
``is nervous over too much growth and has been surprised for
several months now as to how strong things are.''
   Dean A. Gulis, director of reserach for the brokerage Roney &
Co. in Detroit, said the low volume indicates ``there is apathy and
fear on the part of investors generally.''
   Wickes was the second most actively-traded issue on the NYSE,
slipping [ to 13[. A management group has proposed buying the
company for $12 a share.
   Among other actively-traded issues on the NYSE, Coca Cola rose |
to 39[, General Electric was unchanged at 39[ and International
Business Machines rose [ to 110~.
   Clorox rose 2[ to 31| on speculation that a West German company
that already owns a stake in Clorox may be buying more.
   Deere rose 1[ to 42| after the farm-equipment maker reported its
earnings tripled in the quarter ended July 31 despite the drought.
   In over-the-counter trading, Farmers Group climbed 2{ to 69} on
speculation that it may drop its resistance to B.A.T. Industries,
which has proposed a buyout at $72 a share.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, fell $2.236 billion, or 0.09 percent, to
$2.574 trillion.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.10 to 294.59, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index edged up 0.11 to 257.09.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.01
to 292.00. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 373.53, down 0.20.

<HEAD>Luxury Automaker Eliminating 1,200 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC, the British luxury car maker, plans to
eliminate about 1,200 jobs over the next three years in a bid to
increase efficiency, the company said Tuesday.
   The move is part of Jaguar's efforts to match the efficiency
levels of West German competitors, Bayerische Motorenwerke AG,
maker of BMW cars, and Daimler-Benz AG, maker of Mercedes cars, a
company official said.
   Jaguar said the reduction in its manual-labor workforce from
12,500 workers to around 11,300 will be achieved by attrition,
rather than layoffs.
   ``Through natural wastage we lose around 400 workers a year,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``To reach
our workforce target we simply won't replace those who leave.''
   The official said Jaguar's West German competitors produce about
six cars for each worker annually, compared with just over four
cars a worker at Jaguar.
   ``By slimming our workforce and by continuing to invest in
advanced manufacturing processes we intend to catch up,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Transport and General Workers Union, which
represents most Jaguar workers, said unions had been involved in
negotiations over the manpower reduction proposals and were ``glad
that there wouldn't be redundancies.''
   As part of a two-year pay package negotiated last year with
hourly workers, Jaguar intends to speed up production at its plants.
   Workers at its big Coventry assembly plant in the English
midlands first resisted the new productivity levels as unrealistic
but later accepted the targets.
   Jaguar's new production target is 54,000 cars in 1988, compared
with 48,020 cars in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Long-term unemployment has fallen below the 1
million mark for the first time in more than five years, the
government said Tuesday.
   The number of people out of work for longer than 12 months
dropped to 948,000 in the second quarter of 1988, the Department of
Employment said.
   That was a drop of 81,000 from the first three months of the
year and 290,000 from the same period of 1987, the department said.
   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler said there were particularly
sharp drops in long-term unemployment among the young, which fell
by 36 percent from a year ago and by 47 percent over the past two
years.
   He said the long-term jobless benefited from a sustained fall in
unemployment since the summer of 1986, and from a new employment
training program which was designed to equip people with the skills
necessary to fill Britain's 700,000 vacant jobs.
   Britain had an unemployment rate of 8.2 percent in July, or 2.31
million people.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges; Gold Mixed</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged Tuesday despite continued
efforts by central banks in Europe and the United States to
restrain its rise.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $431.85 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$433.20 an ounce late Monday.
   The official attempts to hold down the dollar were lighter than
Monday, but still significant, traders said.
   Among the central banks that sold dollars were those of the
United States, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium and
Austria, said Stephen Leach, a currency analyst for Chemical Bank.
He said the intervention reached from Asia to Europe to the United
States.
   ``The intervention knocks down the dollar, but only
temporarily,'' Leach said. ``The market is convinced that the
dollar can only go higher at this stage.''
   Leach said the Federal Reserve's credibility in knocking down
the dollar was impaired by other steps it took Tuesday to drain
reserves from the banking system. That in effect ``sterilized'' the
intervention by soaking up dollars from the market.
   ``Sterilized intervention isn't going to do the trick,'' Leach
said.
   Supporting the dollar are relatively high U.S. interest rates,
which increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated securities.
   The dollar rose to 133.93 Japanese yen in Tokyo from 133.88 yen
late Monday. Later in London the dollar closed at 133.86 yen. At
the close of trading in New York the dollar rose to 134.11 yen from
133.63 yen late Monday.
   The dollar weakened in London. It took $1.6795 to buy a pound,
up from $1.6767 late Monday. Later in New York, the dollar
strengthened. It took $1.6740 to buy a pound, down from $1.6860
late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.9128 West German marks, up from 1.9068; 1.6102
Swiss francs, up from 1.6075; 1.2308 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2285; 6.4895 French francs, up from 6.4680; and 1,415.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,412.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday: 1.9060 West
German marks, down from 1.9190; 1.6055 Swiss francs, down from
1.6105; 6.4635 French francs, down from 6.5050; 2.1440 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1605; 1,407.50 Italian lire, down from
1,417.00; and 1.2303 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2291.
   In Hong Kong, gold prices rose to $434.59 a troy ounce from
$432.01 an ounce late Monday. Later in Europe, gold rose in London
to $432.75 an ounce from $432.00 and rose in Zurich to $433 an
ounce from $431 an ounce late Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $432.20 an ounce from $433.60 late Monday.
   The price of silver rose in London to $6.74 a troy ounce from
$6.64 an ounce late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed unchanged at $6.730 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Interco Files Suits Against Companies In Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. filed suit in federal court
Tuesday accusing groups led by the Rales brothers with violating
securities laws in their $2.7 billion bid for the retailing concern.
   The suit, filed against Cardinal Acquisition Corp. and City
Capital Associates L.P., claims their outstanding $70-a-share
tender offer involves so much debt and so little equity that it
would, if consummated, violate SEC margin regulations.
   The suit also alleges that the defendants failed to disclose
that the takeover bid was being made on behalf of, among others,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Chase Manhattan Bank, both of which
have equity stakes in Cardinal Acquisition.
   Because the defendants ``have concealed critical facts about
their unlawful conduct, the roles of Drexel Burnham and Chase
Manhattan, and their proposed takeover of Interco,'' the suit
contends, ``Interco's stockholders and the investing public are
being deprived of material information.''
   The suit said shareholders are being forced to make decisions in
a market ``distorted by defendants' illegal conduct and false and
misleading statements.''
   St. Louis-based Interco has rejected the Rales' overtures since
they first offered to acquire the company for $64 a share last
month. The group is led by Steven and Mitchell Rales of Washington,
D.C.
   Earlier Tuesday, Harvey Saligman, Interco's chairman and chief
executive officer, urged shareholders not to tender their shares to
an offer he called financially inadequate.
   Interco manufactures men's and women's apparel, footwear,
furniture and home furnishings. Some of its brand names include
London Fog clothing, Florsheim and Converse shoes and Broyhill and
Ethan Allen furniture.

<HEAD>Digital Unveils Upgraded Ultrix Operating System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. on Tuesday unveiled an
upgraded version of its Ultrix software in what analysts said was a
new commitment to software that many brands of computers can use.
   In a surprise, Digital also said that 10 percent of its revenue
_ almost $1 billion _ came from computer systems that primarily use
the Ultrix operating system.
   Digital, the No. 2 computer maker behind International Business
Machines Corp., also announced new software for hooking computers
of different makes together in networks.
   Digital's Ultrix is a base layer of software that allows
customers to run the same programs on a variety of different
computers. It is a version of the Unix software created by American
Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   Digital said its new Ultrix is the first that complies with all
industry standards and specifications, including the ones announced
Monday by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   The new version of Ultrix, called Ultrix-32 Version 3, ranges in
price from $2,100 to $56,000.
   Digital until last year had been reluctant to give wholehearted
support to Ultrix, preferring that customers use its own VMS
software, which only works on Digital computers.
   ``What Digital is recognizing is that they will have to meet the
user demand for open systems and they are prepared to put money and
organizational commitment behind that,'' said Nina Lytton, an
analyst with the Yankee Group.
   Digital said the new Ultrix software is applicable to
engineering computing, scientific research, government agencies,
and aerospace, automotive and oil industries.
   ``I think we're responding to a marketplace change in demand,''
said Don McInnis, Digital's vice president for engineering systems.
``More and more customers are interested in open operating systems
and we'll be responsive to that.''
   Digital also played a role in founding the $100 million Open
Software Foundation, which announced Monday it would set up
headquarters in Cambridge. Digital, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. and
four other big computer makers formed the consortium to develop a
software operating system that no single company would control.
   Industry analysts viewed the project as a move by those computer
makers against AT&T and its partner, Sun Microsystems Inc., which
together controlled the popular Unix operating system.
   Digital in September 1987 reorganized its marketing structure to
include operating systems and in December appointed two vice
presidents responsible for Ultrix, marking a major change in
emphasis.
   At the news conference, Digital said revenue from computers,
software and services based on its Ultrix operating system now
accounts for about 10 percent of total revenue. Digital last year
reported revenues of $9.39 billion.
   ``It seems to have been a well-kept secret on the outside,''
independent analyst Sonny Monosson said. ``I never realized it was
so high.''

   Clorox Co.'s stock rose in heavy trading
Tuesday amid speculation a West German company and large
shareholder had increased their holdings in the diversified
consumer products giant.
   The company's stock jumped $2.125 to close at $31.625 a share on
an extraordinarily high volume of 1.1 million shares on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   A Clorox spokesman said the company was unaware of any potential
takeover attempt.
   ``We're not aware of the reason behind today's heavy trading,''
said Fred Reicker, director of corporate communications. ``Some of
the people we have talked to have speculated that the Henkel
organization has been buying more shares.''
   Henkel Corp. of West Germany, which has had a cooperative
agreement with Clorox since 1974, announced in March 1987 that it
intended to increase it Clorox holdings to 30 percent, the maximum
allowed under a pact between the two.
   Henkel bought more stock last week and currently owns 26.6
percent of Clorox's shares, according to Reicker.
   Industry observers said stock speculators may also have bought
Clorox shares Tuesday following initial purchases by Henkel, trying
to stage a market rally to drive the stock price higher.
   On Aug. 9, Clorox reported a 26 percent increase in its annual
earnings, attributing the strong performance primarily to a lower
corporate tax rate.
   Clorox is a large, diversified company whose major product is
bleach.

   Southern Progress Corp., an Alabama-based
subsidiary of Time Inc., has agreed in principle to buy Southern
Travel magazine from the New York Times Co. Magazine Group, the
companies announced Tuesday.
   Terms weren't disclosed.
   The New York Times Co. Magazine Group said it acquired the
magazine, then known as Travel South, in 1986 and renamed it
Southern Travel.
   It was published twice in 1987 and four times this year. Its
circulation has grown to 210,000 from 165,000, the Times said in a
statement.
   William Kerr, president of the Times magazine group, said his
company was pleased with the magazine's progress but that the
group's managers wanted to focus on their sports-leisure and
women's service publications that include Family Circle, Golf
Digest, Tennis and Decorating Remodeling.
   Don Logan, chief executive of Southern Progress, said Southern
Travel will complement another of the company's magazines, Southern
Living, in tapping the growing travel market.
   Southern Progress, based in Birmingham, Ala., also publishes
Southern Accents, Progressive Farmer and Cooking Light magazines.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Revco Credit Arrangement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday approved a
$145 million credit plan for Revco D.S. Inc., a drugstore chain
that sought protection from its creditors in court last month.
   ``We interpret this new credit facility as a strong vote of
confidence from our senior bank lenders and the court,'' said Revco
Chairman Boake A. Sells. ``Our stores are open. We have been
saying, `Revco is in business to stay.' We believe our banks are
saying the same thing.''
   Under the agreement approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold F.
White, Wells Fargo Bank and Marine Midland Bank will be the lead
lenders extending the credit to Revco through Feb. 1, 1990.
   The new arrangement is expected to be finalized Sept. 8, Revco
said, and will replace a $50 million interim financing agreement by
Wells Fargo and Marine Midland since Aug. 3.
   Revco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 28,
about a month after it failed to make an interest payment on about
$700 million in outstanding high-risk junk bonds used to finance
its 1986 $1.5 billion leveraged buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through
borrowed funds repaid from a target company's profits or asset
sales.
   The Twinsburg, Ohio-based company sought protection from
creditors after talks with bondholders broke down, becoming the
largest company involved in a leveraged buyout to take such action.

<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin said
Tuesday that ``unconventional'' ways must be found for Latin
American countries to repay their massive foreign debts, and he
suggested one way would be to freeze interest rates.
   ``Beginning next year, we people of Latin America will begin to
find unconventional solutions to resolve the problem of foreign
debt,'' Alfonsin said in an opening address to the 12th annual
assembly of the Latin American Parliament.
   ``These (unconventional solutions) cannot occur without a
freezing of interest rates, and cannot take second place to the
march of the economies of the developed countries,'' he said.
   Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are the three developing countries
with the highest foreign debt. Argentina recheduled last year most
of its $56 billion debt, but still has a hard time repaying
interest that this year will total about $4.6 billion.
   Neighboring Uruguay's $5.3 billion debt, divided theoretically
among its 3 million citizens, is one of the highest per capita in
the world.
   Argentina currently is negotiating with the International
Monetary Fund for a $1.2 billion standby loan, after which it plans
to seek new loans from commercial banks to help meet its interest
payments.
   The loans, made mainly after the oil price increases of the
1970s, are tied to interest rates like the U.S. prime lending rate
and the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. prime rate rose by half a
percentage point to 10 percent. As interest rates rise, so do
repayment costs on the approximately $1 trillion owed by Third
World countries to foreign creditors.
   ``You can't keep looking distractedly at the situation of Latin
America, whose economies are devastated as if there had been a
war,'' said Alfonsin, who has never called for a debt moratorium
but has urged creditor nations to lower interest rates.
   The Latin American Parliament, comprised of legislators from
member countries and having no legislative power of its own, was to
take up the issue of drug trafficking and the political situation
in Central America, as well as the foreign debt question, before
concluding on Saturday.

   One of the West Coast's largest shipbuilding and
tugboat companies emerged from federal bankruptcy protection
Tuesday when family ownership was transferred to employees.
   Unimar International Inc., formerly WFI Industries, began
operations with its 400 employees holding 73 percent of the
company's stock under a reorganization strategy orchestrated by the
investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``We already have some contracts, and we're working on others,''
said Donald Liddle, who resigned as president of the
Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific to become chairman and chief
executive officer of Unimar.
   ``We will be marketing our services very aggressively. We are
looking into fishing vessels and ferry contracts, and we would like
to build a new relationship with the state of Washington,'' Liddle
said.
   His comments came after a ceremony attended by more than 500
people, including the Woeck family, which founded WFI Industries in
1946.
   WFI Industries was a major participant in the Alaskan and
Hawiian barge-towing trade and one of Seattle's principal tug and
barge and shipbuilding contractors, with major customers, including
the U.S. Department of Defense, the Navy and the Coast Guard.
   The company once was one of the state's largest employers before
a slumping industry and financial problems forced it to trim 1,100
jobs and file for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws two years ago.
   ``This is a bittersweet time for the Woeck family,'' Liddle said
of the union-led buyout. ``But they're not doing what most owners
do. They're not just trashing the operation.''
   Former owner Richard Woeck will serve as chief operating officer
of the subsidiary United Tug and Barge and his son, Michael Woeck,
will serve as chief operating officer of United Marine Tug and
Barge, Unimar's other subsidiary.
   John Kissick, managing director of Drexel Burnham's West Coast
corporate finance department, said the financally strapped WFI
wasn't the kind of company Drexel Burnham likes to underwrite.
   ``But the Woecks and the employees were the success in this
effort. We have a model for troubled companies around the
country,'' Kissick said.
   ``I was hopeful,'' said sandblast leadman Alan Wright, who
worked for WFI subsidiary Marine Power & Electric Co for seven
years. ``I was let go when the company went bankrupt. I was framing
houses and then I got called back here in October 1987.''
   Under the reorganization plan, about 4.5 percent of each
worker's gross earnings will be withheld for the next two years to
ensure the company meets its obligations.
   In return, employees will control the 10-member board of
directors. Drexel will hold a 5 percent stake in the company.
   A March 1984 financial statement of the Woeck family listed $165
million in assets and $14 million in liabilities. Drexel put
Unimar's current net worth at $9 million.
   More than 8,000 companies in the United States are
employee-owned, according to the National Center for Employee
Ownership in Bethesda, Maryland.
   The center called the Unimar-WFI reorganization one of the
largest ownership transfers to employees since the 1984 transfer of
the Weirton Steel Corporation in West Virginia.

<HEAD>IMF Approves $1.4 Billion Loan for Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund approved a
$1.4 billion loan to Brazil on Tuesday, to go along with proposed
new lending of $5.2 billion from commercial banks, an IMF spokesman
said.
   The fund will disburse the new loan by installments through Feb.
28, 1990, so that the money can be cut off in case the fund decides
that Brazil's economy has not performed as promised.
   Brazil reportedly has promised to cut government spending by 22
percent, as an economic austerity condition such as those often
required by the IMF.
   The new loans will amount to less than the interest payments on
Brazil's existing debt of $121 billion, the largest in the Third
World. Last year, Brazil suspended interest payments on what it
owed to banks, but has begun them again this year.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega said in July that the
suspension has not been formally revoked, but might be once the
nation's 700 creditor banks joined in the new bank loan agreement.
He announced last week in New York that 95 percent of the total had
been committed.
   In addition to its mounting debts, the government of President
Jose Sarney has been struggling with inflation, which reached a
record 24.04 percent in July. One report has suggested that the
rate will reach 927 percent for the year, well above the level of
600 percent said to be the basis for the agreement between the
government, the IMF and the banks.
   The IMF spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, did not say how
soon the new loan would have to be repaid. Brazil will have 20
years to pay back the $5.2 billion from the banks, including an
eight-year grace period during which only interest will be due.
   On July 30, Brazil agreed in Paris with 13 creditor governments
to delay repayment of $5 billion of its $15 billion debt to them.
The rescheduled debts, which fall due between Jan. 1, 1987 and
March 31, 1990 were delayed for 10 years, with a five-year grace
period.
   Brazil has not been making payments on principal of its bank
debt, either.

<HEAD>Fallen Computer Whiz Indicted on 11 Counts of Felony Larceny</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state grand jury indicted fallen computer
whiz Tex Zachary Hildreth on 11 counts of felony larceny Tuesday,
for allegedly bilking six investors out of more than $500,000 to
keep his failing company in operation.
   Hildreth, 24, fled the state and apparently tried to commit
suicide with his mother in a New Hampshire hotel after creditors
and authorities seized his Massdata Corp. in May.
   Mike McGorty, spokesman for Norfolk County District Attorney
William Delahunt, said Hildreth apparently solicited the money to
pay off other investors and some bank notes.
   Hildreth orchestrated ``various financial deals where he
promised investors substantial returns,'' McGorty said. ``The money
is still outstanding.''
   Hildreth also was charged with using falsified documents to
obtain bank loans, McGorty said.
   Each of the 11 counts in the indictment carries a maximum
penalty of five years in prison or a $25,000 fine and two years in
prison, McGorty said.
   During a two-month period, the grand jury heard testimony from
more than 50 witnesses, McGorty said, and an investigation was
continuing.
   Hildreth is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Norfolk
Superior Court. His attorney did not return telephone calls made by
The Associated Press after business hours Tuesday.
   Hildrethbought his first computer at age 16 and, with the help
of a mentor, rented office space to start his own software firm at
age 20. He quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success,
including a $220,000 Weymouth condominium, a $32,000 BMW, and a
50-inch, $4,000 color TV.
   Massdata was closed in May when Rockland Trust Co., which was
owed more than $400,000, tried to seize its assets.
   Hildreth and his mother, Rose, 50, fled Massachusetts after the
Braintree-based company was closed. They were captured shortly
afterward when an employee at a Manchester, N.H., motel called
police to report a bloodied man wandering in the lobby.
   Police found Hildreth, who apparently had slashed his wrists, in
the lobby. They found his mother lying in their hotel room and also
found a bottle of non-prescription pills in the room along with
what appeared to be suicide notes.

<TEXT>
   More than 39,000 consumers who own
Chrysler Motors Corp. cars that were test-driven with disconnected
odometers will receive at least $500 in restitution, under a
nationwide settlement detailed Tuesday.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who served as the
lead negotiator in the $16 million-plus settlement with the
automaker earlier this year, briefed reporters on the details at a
news conference.
   He said attorneys general from nine other states assisted in the
settlement proceeding filed Aug. 19 in U.S. District Court in St.
Louis.
   The action was taken on behalf of consumers in 46 states and
Guam and Puerto Rico. The states that did not participate in the
settlement are Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada and South Carolina,
Webster said.
   Chrysler agreed last year to pay about $16 million to settle the
matter, but approval of a settlement was delayed by lawsuits filed
against it by consumers and authorities around the country.
   Chrysler pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of
odometer tampering. Chrysler stopped disconnecting odometers in
October 1986, after learning of the government investigation.
   Webster said his office, as well as officials in certain other
states, were mailing letters to consumers who own cars test driven
in the company's ``Overnight Evaluation Program.''
   In the program, which took place for years, new cars were driven
by company executives as part of the testing process before the
vehicles were shipped to dealers. Odometers on those cars were
disconnected while the executives drove them, leading buyers to
believe they had bought new cars.
   The letters tell consumers what steps they must take to
determine if they are eligible for a minimum of $500 in restitution
from the company and outlines procedures they must follow.
   Chrysler also will run advertisements in the country's 20
largest newspapers on Friday about the settlement, Webster said.
   The settlement affects consumers who purchased a car made by
Chrysler before Oct. 9, 1986. Consumers must have owned that car on
July 31, 1987, to participate in the settlement.
   Only consumers who purchased cars test driven with a
disconnected odometer in the company's Overnight Evaluation Program
will be affected, Webster said.
   U.S. District Court Judge John F. Nangle will hold a fairness
hearing regarding the settlement Oct. 11 in St. Louis, Webster said.
   Consumers who have objections about the settlement must file
complaints with the court by Sept. 30.
   After the hearing, consumers will have 90 days to submit to the
federal court a ``Proof of Claim and Release Form'' regarding the
settlemnt. Consumers who do not file such a claim forfeit all
rights to participate in Chrysler's settlement, the attorney
general said.
   Chrysler has announced it would increase warranty coverage for
cars on which odometers had been disconnected. A handful of the
cars were involved in accidents and consumers that purchased those
cars will receive new automobiles, Webster said.
   Webster said mileage on affected cars probably ranged from 40
miles to 200 or 300 miles.
   ``When you put it in that context and consumers are getting $1
to $10 for every mile driven, plus a brand new warranty, we think
it's a good settlement,'' Webster said.
   Webster said Chrysler will be forced to pay at least $16 million
in restitution regardless of how many of the 39,500 consumers take
part in the program. So if only half of the consumers file claims,
they would receive $1,000, Webster said.

<HEAD>Report: China Will Fall Short Of Grain Goals This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Natural disasters and rising grain farming costs
have made it almost certain China will not achieve its 1988 grain
production goals, an official daily said Wednesday.
   The China Daily, quoting officials from the National Research
Center for Development of Science and Technology, said 28 million
acres of farmland in 18 provinces, about 10 percent of China's
total, have been hit by a severe drought.
   Another 17.3 million acres have been inundated by floods, with
2.5 million acres seriously damaged.
   The report said summer grain output will fall short of the quota
and a bumper autumn crop _ considered unlikely because of the
natural disasters _ would be needed to reach the target of 410
million tons.
   Most agriculture experts now say this year's production probably
will fall slightly short of the 402 million ton figure of 1987.
   ``Reports of a real disaster are certainly premature,'' said one
Western diplomat who follows China's agricultural situation. ``The
most likely projection is that the grain crop will be down a little
bit from last year.''
   The China Daily report said that only about 258.4 million acres
in autumn grains is being planted, down 2.1 million acres from last
year.
   The report said government pricing policies also continue
driving farmers away from grain and into vegetables and other cash
crops that command higher prices on the free markets.
   Costs of such items as chemical fertilizer, plastic sheeting,
pesticides and farm machinery have shot up in recent years.
Government-set prices for grain, while somewhat higher, have failed
to keep pace with production costs.
   The daily said prices of fertilizer and other items rose 13
percent in the first five months of the year.
   Poor financial returns from growing grain have been a major
reason for a three-year slump in production. After reaching a
record 407 million tons in 1984, output fell to 379 million tons in
1985, then edged back up to 391 million tons in 1986 and 402
million tons last year.
   Premier Li Peng has said China must increase output to 500
million tons by the year 2000 merely to keep up with population
growth.

   Duffy was born in Ottawa, Ill. in 1919 and joined USG, a
building materials and industrial processing company, in the 1940s
when it was known as U.S. Gypsum.
   Duffy began his career in the research department and in 1969
was elected to the board of directors and named executive vice
president of USG's building materials business.
   He is survived by his wife and daughter.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Friday in suburban Glenview,
with burial in nearby Des Plaines.
