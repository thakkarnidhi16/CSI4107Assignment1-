<HEAD>U.S. Bishops Back Mediation Effort by Panamanian Colleague</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with McGrath suspending mediation
effort.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Roman Catholic bishops have lent
moral support for Archbishop Marcos McGrath's now-suspended offer
to mediate talks between the Panamanian government and the
opposition which has been trying to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   A letter of support from the American bishops to McGrath, the
archbishop of Panama, was released on Thursday, just hours before
McGrath announced he was suspending the mediation effort.
   McGrath said he was withdrawing his offer because: opposition
groups refused to talk to the government until it showed a
willingness to discuss Noriega's departure; Noriega hadn't offered
explicit backing of the initiative in writing; and there were no
assurances that the four international leaders who proposed the
talks could be present.
   Archbishop John L. May, president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, in the letter to McGrath, said: ``The voice of
the church in Panama has been clear and consistent, denouncing the
instances of civic corruption and state violence that have
tragically become so much a part of recent news reports.''
   The letter was made public Thursday.
   Manuel Solis Palma, the acting president of Panama, said his
government agreed to talks mediated by the church. But the
opposition insists on assurances that Noriega is willing to step
down and leave the country.
   ``I write to express our full support and ecclesial solidarity
with you, your fellow bishops and all the suffering people of
Panama,'' May said in his letter to McGrath.
   He added that ``we continue to urge our own national leaders to
exercise the greatest care in balancing pursuit of legitimate U.S.
interests in the region with the essential quest for a peaceful and
just settlement of this crisis.'''

   The neighbors are worried about a
110-pound pet snow leopard caged in his owner's suburban yard, but
officials say the owner is within his rights.
   Albert Porges bought the big cat, member of an endangered
species in the Himalayas, at auction last year and says there is no
town bylaw preventing him from having the animal as long as he
meets strict state and federal rules.
   ``It's an issue everyone in the neighborhood is upset about,''
said Margaret Conopka, who lives nearby with her husband and three
young children. Town animal control officer David Doten said he has
visited the leopard's home, a 36-by-12-foot cage that is 20 feet
high. ``It's satisfactory to me, but if it ever got loose, I don't
know what we would do about it,'' he said.

   The nation's only college croquet
court plays host to its first intercollegiate tournament Friday
with little fanfare and some embarrassment to Smith College
officials, says the professor who raised money for the field.
   ``I'm told that this event promotes the idea that Smith is
elitist,'' said Richard Young, a literature professor emeritus at
the 2,000-student school who was instrumental in getting the court
built. ``If it weren't, they'd be out of business.''
   Administrators at the private women's college denied any
embarrassment about the 105-foot by 84-foot field.
   ``There might have been a few faculty snickers and comments made
on why we would spend time and money building a croquet court when
there are other more important things to do,'' said Director of
Development Charlotte Heartt.
   ``But it was no skin off our backs. It didn't cost us
anything,'' she said. The $16,000 court was paid for by donations
from alumnae interested in the sport.
   However, Young said the already jittery administrators were
delivered an blow when New England Monthly magazine noted in its
January issue that the ``mere $16,000'' spent on the ``elaborately
irrigated'' court would nearly cover a year's tuition and room and
board charges for a scholarship student.
   ``This is preposterous,'' said Young, who has described croquet
as a cross between billiards and chess. ``This is the one sport
that is absolutely neutral in age and gender. It didn't even occur
to me to add `race.'
   ``And it's cheaper than golf by a whole lot.''
   Concerns about the school's elitist image began with its recent
racial problems. The first black woman to earn tenure at the
college quit in December, saying Smith was lethargic in combating
racism. Two black administrators followed soon after.
   But the school argues that it has taken great pains to fight
racism and attract minorities since a spray-painted slur appeared
on the steps of a campus building in October 1986.
   A survey Smith commissioned found its image problem had more to
do with elitism than racism. More than half the 788 students, staff
and administrators polled said they had been victims of class
discrimination, according to the survey released in November.
   One problem remaining for the croquet court is getting it
dedicated.
   Ms. Heartt said the college had arranged for a ceremony April 23
before learning that the school's croquet team would be in Lenox
for a tournament. And President Mary Maples Dunn will be out of
town this weekend.
   ``We can't get a schedule clear that suits both me and the
team,'' Ms. Dunn said through a spokeswoman.
   In the English version that will be played this weekend among 40
competitors from nine of New England schools, from Harvard and
Wellesley to the universities of Maine and Massachusetts, teams of
two players each shepherd two balls twice around a wicketed turf.
   Friday's game at the Smith court, which means players no longer
have to go 50 miles to a Lenox hotel court, is the first of the
season for the fledgling New England Collegiate Croquet Association.
   ``I can understand why the college is nervous,'' said NECCA
Director Xandra Kayden. ``They don't have enough experience with
college croquet to understand the good press it gets. But I can
also understand Dick, because croquet changed his life.''
   Young, 66, lost one leg and suffered a crippling injury to his
other foot during World War II. He had trouble moving and had given
up on sports until he discovered croquet a few years ago. He
organized the Smith team and persuaded alumnae to donate the money
for the court.

   One of the thousands of small commuter
buses that careen about Kenya every day carries an appropriate
bumper sticker: ``You never know, heaven could be nearer than
home.''
   Authorities say the overcrowded, poorly maintained, wildly
driven buses called ``matatus'' have contributed heavily to Kenya's
highway death toll of nearly 200 so far this year.
   At that rate, the toll is roughly on pace with 1987 when 1,889
people died in traffic accidents _ or one person killed for every
166 cars on Kenya's roads. A similar rate in the United States
would mean that annual highway fatalities, now fewer than 50,000,
would reach more than 1 million a year.
   The privately owned matatus carry such names as ``Survival of
the Fittest'' and ``Living Devil.''
   Scary as it all may be, the poor people who use them have no
other choice.
   The brightly colored vehicles are legally allowed to carry no
more than 25 passengers. But usually matatu crews cram in twice
that many or more to get more fares. Those who can't fit inside
climb onto the roof and cling to luggage as the buses go into a
list on high-speed turns.
   Thirty-one people were killed Feb. 29 in a three-matatu crash
that incensed a nation already accustomed to headlines screaming of
``horror smashes,'' and ``matatu madness.''
   For days after the crash, newspapers printed pictures of victims
strewn across the road and of the crumpled matatus.
   Commentaries called for something to be done about matatus, and
a road-safety program was reintroduced on the government's Voice of
Kenya television.
   The head of the Matatu Association of Kenya resigned rather, he
said, than be ``cursed by the innocent blood of the commuters who
die daily on our roads at the hands of reckless matatu drivers.''
   President Daniel arap Moi, whose government in 1984 passed the
first legislation aimed at controlling matatus, decided they had
become more ``an agent of death and destruction than an asset to
the commuter.''
   Police began a crackdown, netting hundreds of unroadworthy and
overcrowded vehicles. Matatu crews, as well as unseated passengers,
were hit with heavy fines.
   The Ministry of Transport issued a new and more stringent list
of regulations and ordered all matatu drivers retested.
   But the matatu industry retaliated with a strike that stranded
hundreds of thousands of people. Moi rescinded the retesting order,
and the matatus returned after a day off the roads.
   Moi's response to the strike underscored the matatu industry's
stranglehold on the nation's transportation sector.
   Less than 1 percent of Kenya's 22 million people own cars and
fewer than 600 buses are on the roads. The lack of vehicles leaves
a demand for transportation met by the tens of thousands of
matatus, which mostly are vans and minibuses, that travel even the
most rural routes.
   Matatus first appeared as pirate taxis in the mid-1950s when
Kenya was a British colony and movement by the native population
was restricted.
   The industry burgeoned after independence in 1963 when
restrictions were lifted and people were allowed to move to the
cities, swelling metropolitan populations and increasing the need
for public transport.
   The name matatu comes from the Kikuyu term ``mang'otore
matatus,'' meaning 30 Kenyan cents, which at that time was the
standard matatu fare.
   Today, the average fare around Nairobi is 3 shillings (19 U.S.
cents) and routes are flexible.
   To increase profits and their own $40 to $75 monthly salaries,
matatu crews overload the buses, work overly long hours at the
wheel and drive at high speeds in order to meet daily quotas set by
matatu owners.
   At least 80 percent of the matatu crews work seven-day weeks and
average 10 hours a day in vehicles that suffer most often from
engine, brake or gear-box failure, according to a 1982 study by the
Nairobi-based Mazengira Institute.
   Many drivers admit to chewing khat, a stimulative twig, or
smoking marijuana to keep themselves alert.
   In one of the dozens of commentaries on matatus, a columnist for
the Daily Nation, Kenya's leading newspaper, blamed ``greed,
brainless bravado and showmanship'' for the road carnage caused by
matatus.
   ``The nation should not allow lunatics to ply the roads any
longer,'' the columnist said.

   A 61-year-old college professor, infatuated
with the lilting Scottish voice recording of his bank's automated
teller, finally got to meet the woman of his cash machine dreams.
   ``I guess the first thing I should say is, `Your transaction is
processing,''' said Sally Masterson, a 29-year-old British radio
talk-show host, on meeting Dick Ferry after a trans-Atlantic flight
Wednesday.
   The encounter was arranged by the Decatur Herald & Review's
editors, who tracked down Ms. Masterson after Ferry, an education
professor, wrote a Feb. 4 newspaper column about his ``infatuation
with the talking teller.''
   ``She is very sweet, she is very charming,'' Ferry said later.
``She is a person I'd very much like to have for a friend.''
   ``I think he's smashing,'' said Ms. Masterson. ``He's what I
call wacky, because he's got that wacky sense of humor.''
   Ferry's wife, Carol, said she first heard Ms. Masterson's voice
last weekend. Before Wednesday's meeting, Mrs. Ferry asked, ``How
would anyone feel if a young sexy person wants to meet your
husband?''
   Ms. Masterson, who is single, made the teller-machine recording
three years ago in Dundee, Scotland, for NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio.
   ``I thought she was charming,'' Mrs. Ferry said. ``I've
thoroughly enjoyed this.'' Ms. Masterson returns to Britian on
Tuesday.

   After a short-lived stint as a party
animal, Bullwinkle the moose has come home to roost atop the pizza
palace from which he was moosenapped seven months ago.
   As you'll recall, in our our last episode, the 40-foot
inflatable effigy of Rocket J. Squirrel's best buddy vanished from
the roof of Bullwinkle's Family Food 'n Fun Restaurant in August.
   The restaurant, eager to get its $17,000 mascot back, offered
the culprits free pizza for a year for the 300-pound moose on the
loose. Suspicion soon focused on the notorious spy Boris Badenov
and his companion, Natasha.
   Finally, on April Fool's Day a deflated Bullwinkle was
unceremoniously deposited in the parking lot of the eatery along
with a 2-by-3-foot note.
   ``Hey guys! The moose is no longer loose. He wanted to party
with us so we brought him along. It turns out he was too wild for
us! Please keep an eye on him, he's dangerous! April Fools, Class
of '88.
   ``P.S. Sorry.''
   Police, who say the case is closed, believe the moose's
abductors may have been students from Santa Clara High who decided
to give back Bullwinkle after they realized what it was worth.
   The restaurant manager, however, can't just laugh it off, having
ordered a replacement moose for the roof.
   Stay tuned for the next episode: ``Wedding Bells For
Bullwinkle?'' or ``Hey, Bub, This Roof Ain't Big Enough For Both of
Us!''

   While many people are griping about
having to pay a quarter to mail a letter, the U.S. Postal Service
has given the 700 residents of this West Pacific island chain
something to smile about. Ulithi Atoll finally has its own Zip Code.
   The atoll, best known as the site from where the United States
launched its World War II invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima, is
part of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia, a former
trust territory that holds a compact of free association with the
United States. It is about 1,200 miles southeast of Okinawa.
   Ulithi Atoll includes dozens of islands, but people live on just
four of them. Only about 700 people live here now, but in September
1944 hundreds of warships gathered in the atoll's sheltered lagoon
to prepare for the 1945 invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima. The
Ulithi rendezvous was the largest U.S. Navy task force assembled
during the war.
   A post office opened here in March to distribute mail flown in
from Colonia, the island's governmental seat about 100 miles east
of Ulithi. The postal address is Ulithi, Yap, FM 96943.

   Amid the dusty debris of the bombed-out
children's hospital were a stuffed Mickey Mouse doll, a white
plastic toy horse and a poster for children to learn English from
pictures.
   The director of the Bahrami children's hospital in downtown
Tehran said about 60 children were inside the building when an
Iraqi missile blasted into it at about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``All of us were working normally. There was no alarm,''
Mohammad Reza Tayayori told reporters.
   ``We have recovered eight bodies of children up to now,'' he
said, speaking through an interpreter. ``Three are still missing
and we fear they are buried under the debris.''
   He said he could not give the number of injured as they had been
moved to several other hospitals since.
   But a doctor at the hospital said about 20 children were
seriously injured. Tahayori said there were about 60 children in
the hospital at the time of the attack. Normally the hospital has
about 250 patients, but most were evacuated when the shelling
between Iran and Iraq flared anew Feb. 29.
   He said three nurses also were killed and 20 were seriously
injured. The group of foreign reporters was led over a huge pile of
debris that was once the kindergarten ward.
   In the street, a crowd stared at the visiting reporters.
   A bearded old man shouted frantically, ``Where is the United
Nations? Is this human rights?'' His cries were translated by an
interpreter.
   A young man who spoke English said he heard a ``terrible sound''
before the impact, then saw a huge cloud of smoke rising over the
site.
   ``I was shocked. I saw a woman lying on the street, her face all
bloodied.'' he said.
   As the journalists returned from the trip, they were told that
all would have to leave Iran by Thursday. The reporters had been
invited to Iran in the wake of alleged Iraqi chemical-bomb attacks
on Kurdish villages in Iraq.
   An official of the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, which organizes
all press visits, said the reporters were asked to leave to ensure
their safety.
   He said suthorities expected the Iraqis to a launch massive
missile attacks on Tehran on Friday, the day Iranians elect a new
parliament.
   Newspapers have been carrying daily commentaries warning that
Baghdad will seek to disrupt the elections by making residents
leave the capital on that day.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last week called on citizens to go
to the polls ``even if they are under a barrage of Iraqi misile and
bomb attacks'' to ``perform their Islamic and divine duty'' and
vote.

   With the spiriting away of Juan Ramon Matta
from Honduras to an Illinois prison, three of four reputed drug
barons sought in the killing of an American drug agent are behind
bars.
   The Feb. 7, 1985 kidnapping of Enrique Camarena Salazar, a
special agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, put the
spotlight on the immense power and wealth accumulated by drug
traffickers in Mexico.
   The bodies of Camarena and Alfredo Zavala Avelar were found
March 5, 1985. Zavala Avelar was a Mexican pilot who worked with
Camarena in anti-narcotics programs from their base in Guadalajara,
Mexico's second-largest city.
   During the hunt for Camarena and then for his killers, an
outline of a powerful drug organization became clear. U.S.
officials called the organization La Familia _ the Family.
   Talk of Mexican cooperation in anti-drug programs was replaced
in Washington by charges of widespread corruption. The narcotics
issue has remained a major sticking point in U.S.-Mexican relations.
   The four top men in the illicit drug trade were said to be
Ernesto ``Don Neto'' Fonseca, reportedly the organization's leader;
Rafael Caro Quintero, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, and Matta.
   Matta is a Honduran citizen and the others are Mexican.
   Although they were not all accused of direct participation,
their organization that was believed responsible for ordering
Camarena's murder.
   ``These people were all involved in a drug trafficking
organization,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman William Graves said.
   Caro Quintero and Fonseca were taken into custody in spring 1985
and remain imprisoned, charged in Camarena's murder.
   Matta was picked up Tuesday in a pre-dawn helicopter police raid
at his home in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and put on a
flight out of the country without a passport.
   Honduran legislators angrily called the incident a
``kidnapping'' and the Foreign Ministry started an investigation of
the procedures used.
   The exploits of Caro Quintero in particular, his rise from
poverty to vast wealth, have given him almost a folk hero status in
Mexico. Two escape tunnels were discovered last fall near his
prison, one almost complete.
   Felix Gallardo remains at large. No warrant has been issued for
him in Mexico. Reports surface from time to time that he dined with
a governor or made some other public appearace.
   ``There are more than 50 people imprisoned,'' Felipe Flores,
spokesman for the federal attorney general's office, said Wednesday
when asked for a status report on the Camarena case.
   The U.S. Embassy count is 63 people in custody in the case, a
small number of them sentenced.
   ``We expect the Mexican judicial system to find these people
guilty. We expect convictions, given the overwhelming evidence
against them,'' Graves said.
   In January, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted nine
people, including Caro Quintero, on charges stemming from the
Camarena kidnap and murder.
   The attorney general's office said: ``The respective trials will
continue to develop before the Mexican jurisdictional bodies,
independent of whatever procedure is opened in the United States or
in third countries.''
   Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirez said in a February
interview with The Associated Press that recriminations between
Mexico and the United States over which one is lagging in the drug
trade war are not in the interest of either country.
   ``We find it difficult to accept the opinion held in the United
States of what really goes on in Mexico,'' he said. ``The border is
not a border between black and white, good and evil. It is a border
between countries.''

   As part of its ``For Kids' Sake'' campaign, Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV

   ``We've never done anything like this,'' said General Manager
Joe Berwanger. ``It's our job to air the best and most appropriate
programming for our viewers, and we believe this 15-minute break
from TV will be a very special time for anyone watching with kids.''
   The station also plans to broadcast public service spots in
place of local advertisements during the day.

   Inflation in Britain fell to an annual rate of 3.3
percent in 1987, its lowest level in 20 years, the government said.
   Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent during the year, down from 3.9
percent in 1986 and the lowest level since 1967, the Department of
Employment said Wednesday.
   The price of some goods fell. Coffee dropped 8 percent and gas
charges were 4.5 percent lower, but that was offset in part by a 22

   Cuba, known worldwide for making fine cigars,
will participate in an international stop-smoking day.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said Cuban participation
today should not be considered ``a novelty,'' even though Cuba is a
major tobacco producer.
   ``A strong campaign against the smoking habit has been under way
for some years and has achieved already positive results, even
though at the expense of an important reduction in income from the
sale of cigarettes and tobacco,'' said the dispatch received in
Mexico City on Wednesday.
   The campaign intensified after Cuban President Fidel Castro gave
up his trademark cigars about two years ago.
   Prensa Latina said per capita consumption of cigarettes and
tobacco has been declining since 1986 and sales dropped by $100
million last year. It also said from today onward smoking will be
banned on all Cuban domestic flights.

   A teacher who won a landmark court
decision allowing him to continue teaching despite suffering from
AIDS says his life has almost returned to normal even though his
body is weakening.
   ``There are some days that I think nothing is wrong, and there
are other times when I know very well something is, uh, lurking in

   Chalk, a vocational counselor for hearing-impaired students at
Venado Middle School and University High School in Irvine, filed a
lawsuit against the Orange County Department of Education last year
when officials reassigned him to a desk job after learning he had
AIDS.
   In November, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in what
is believed to have been the nation's first such AIDS
discrimination case, saying he could not be barred from the
classroom.
   Chalk, 43, said he never anticipated the publicity the case
generated, which forced his parents to tell their friends that
their only son was homosexual, something they had known for years.
Chalk said he felt sorry for himself at first.
   ``I'm not nor ever have been a very sexually active kind of
person,'' said Chalk, who lives in Long Beach with a companion of
six years. ``I thought, `Other people are out there doing a lot
more than I am. They would make better subjects.' But you can't go
through life dealing with `Why me's?'''
   But now, he's motivated to remain in the classroom, although he
weighs 130 pounds, down from 160, and is plagued by a chronic sinus
infection, he said. Chalk has trimmed his work week to three days
so he won't weaken.
   ``There are people who want to say, `See? Knew you couldn't do
it,''' he said.
   Chalk said he listens to motivational tapes and uses visual
imagery in fighting AIDS, and has given up casual cocaine use and
alcohol.
   ``I'm trying to create as much health in my life and my body as
possible,'' he said.

   A civil court will hear the Rev. Charles E.
Curran's complaints that Catholic University illegally ousted him
from his teaching post as a result of Vatican displeasure with his
theology.
   Curran, a prominent professor of theology, is suing the
university for breach of contract.
   Superior Court Judge Bruce D. Beaudin on Tuesday rejected the
university's claim that Curran's suspension was under church law
and therefore is immune to civil court review.
   ``This court finds the university's position without merit,''
Beaudin said in a written order denying a motion by the university
for dismissal of the suit. ``Professor Curran's claim is based on
an employment contract governed by the civil law and contract
principles of the District of Columbia,'' Beaudin said.
   Ann Smith, a spokeswoman for the university, said ``we don't
comment on ongoing litigation.''
   The Vatican, in 1986, declared Curran unfit to teach as a
Catholic theologian because of his dissenting views on sexual
issues.
   He had expressed the view that contraception and sterilization
``are not intrinsically evil,'' and that ``in certain
circumstances,'' the church should allow divorce. He has also said
that for a ``genuine homosexual, homosexual acts in the context of
a loving relationship striving for permanency can in a certain
sense be objectively and morally acceptable.''
   Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington, D.C., the ex-officio
chancellor of Catholic University, suspended Curran from all
teaching at the university last January.
   Curran, who now teaches at Cornell University, challenged the
suspension in court as a breach of university bylaws and his
contract. The school asked dismissal of the suit, principally on
the ground that court interference in canon law is barred by the
freedom of religion clause in the Constitution.
   Beaudine said he did not dispute the school's contention that
the court lacks authority ``to review and examine the university's
interpretation and application of canon law'' and that his ruling
applied only to Curran's academic tenure and employment contract.
   In a statement released by his lawyers, Curran said he is not
asking the church ``to do or change anything in its decision
concerning me. I am asking the court to ensure that a civilly
incorporated university follow its own bylaws and its contract with
me.''

<HEAD>Quarantine Ordered To Stop Spread Of Bee Mite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has ordered an
immediate quarantine for 13 states to help prevent the further
spread of a tiny killer mite that threatens the U.S. bee industry.
   The restrictions, announced Wednesday, ban the shipment from
those states of bees and apiary equipment, said Larry B. Slagle,
acting associate administrator of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
   States affected by the quarantine are: Florida, Illinois, Maine,
Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin.
   Of the major honey producing states, only California and North
Dakota so far remain unaffected by the mites, whose scientific name
is Varroa Jacobsoni. The female is about one-twentieth of an inch
in diameter, and the male is somewhat smaller.
   The mites were discovered in the United States last September in
a Wisconsin apiary and since have spread to the 12 other states.
   ``Varroa mites can be spread by the movement of queen bees,
package bees, hives, pollen, honeycomb with brood cells, and apiary
equipment and vehicles,'' Slagle said. ``Under our regulations,
these articles will be prohibited from moving interstate from
quarantined areas unless certain conditions are met.''
   The female Varroa mite lays 3 to 20 eggs in the protective comb
cell of a developing bee. Young mites emerge and suck the blood of
the bee larvae, killing or causing them to be deformed and useless
to the hive _ in which case they are killed by the worker bees.
   If agency inspectors determine that there is no risk of mites,
they can issue certificates allowing the movement of articles out
of the quarantined states, Slagle said. In other cases, a ``limited
permit'' may be issued to move articles that do not pose a pest
risk, provided that additional precautions are taken.
   Slagle said the quarantine order ``will help protect our
beekeeping industry as well as the estimated $20 billion worth of
agricultural crops pollinated by bees each year.''
   The external parasites can infest bees and their developing
larvae so gradually that the mites are unnoticed until serious
damage is done. The damage includes decreased broods, deformed bees
and a weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and
produce honey.
   Caree Lawrence, an agency spokeswoman, said no termination date
for the quarantine was set and that she had no idea when the
restrictions might be lifted.
   The Environmental Protection Agency in January approved the use
of a chemical, fluvalinate, in the fumigation of bees and hives for
mites, she said. A Texas company, Zoecon Corp. of Dallas,
manufactures a plastic strip under the commercial name Apistan,
which contains fluvalinate.
   Ms. Lawrence said the strips can be used to fumigate bees and
hives, with the supers or honey collectors removed first, in order
to be certified as free of mites.
   But as for a general breakthrough in the prevention or rapid
eradication of Varroa mites, she said USDA scientists are still
looking.
   After the mites were detected last year, some experts speculated
that the pests might have come into the United States as much as
two or three years before. But no one knows for sure.
   Some authorities said the Varroa mite orginated in Asia where it
coexisted with Asian honeybees. However, U.S. bees are of European
origin and are highly vulnerable to the pests.

   Cattle tick fever is being targeted by
Agriculture Department scientists in a new experiment this year on
St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Millions of sterile male cattle ticks will be released on a St.
Croix test site to see whether the procedure can be used to control
cattle fever, officials said Wednesday.
   ``We hope sterile (male) releases will stop female ticks from
producing new generations that would infest cattle,'' said Ronald
B. Davey, an entomologist in the department's Agricultural Research
Service. ``Island people are safe from the disease. Humans are not
bitten by the tick, nor do they get the disease.''
   Cattle fever, or babesiosis, kills up to 80 percent of the adult
cattle that get the disease, he said.
   The experiment will be tried for the first time ``late this
year'' on St. Croix. Cattle fever is widespread in the Caribbean,
including the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, as well as in
Mexico and many other areas, he said.
   Davey, who works at the agency's Cattle Tick Fever Research
Laboratory, Mission, Texas, said cattle become anemic after the
ticks bite them and injects a protozoan parasite into the
bloodstream.
   Cattle ticks ``periodically sneak over the Mexican border into
Texas'' where a USDA eradication program stops them from spreading
beyond a buffer zone, he said.
   ``These ticks are tough,'' Davey said in a statement issued
here. ``If they were to get a strong hold again in the southern
United States, the disease could devastate the southern cattle
industry. All U.S. cattle breeds are susceptible.''
   The sterile male ticks are hybrids, which produce no offspring
when they mate. Davey said the test will be on 130 wooded acres
USDA has leased from the Virgin Islands government.
   No cattle are in the area now, so Davey expects there are few
ticks. As part of the preparation, however, cattle will be put into
the wooded area along with some naturally fertile ticks. After
those ticks settle in, their numbers will be estimated.
   Then, Davey explained, about five hybrid ticks for each
estimated natural tick will be released at two-month intervals.
   Until a count is made of the natural ticks, no estimate is
available of how many sterile hybrids will be released, but the
number could be in the hundreds of millions or even billions.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Will Reagan Help or Hinder Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's men are dropping hints that
the president is ready to hit the campaign trail on George Bush's
behalf after a hoped-for triumphal return from the Moscow summit.
   Yet no matter when Reagan makes his choice known, his
involvement in the Bush campaign must walk a careful line. It's
possible Reagan's involvement could overshadow rather than enhance
the vice president's effort.
   ``The president will help the vice president in any way, shape
or form,'' predicted Ed Rollins, Reagan's former political adviser.
``But it's got to be George Bush ... who lays out the Bush agenda.''
   ``We'd love to see Ronald Reagan campaign for George Bush,''
said Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the House Democratic Whip.
``Reagan's strength is his personality and that's not George Bush's
strength. On the stump, Reagan would make Bush look weak.''
   Reagan has been meticulous about maintaining an official
neutrality. Now that Bush has nearly racked up enough delegates to
be the nominee, the White House has given notice Reagan is itching
to take a more active role.
   ``He's ready at the drop of a hat to get out there on the
road,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced last week.
   Taking note of Bush's string of primary and caucus victories,
Fitzwater said he wanted to raise the possibility that Reagan will
abandon his pledge to campaign only after a nominee had been chosen
at the Aug. 15-18 GOP convention in New Orleans.
   ``I think that in view of the way the campaign has developed ...
we could see the president involved in some political activities
before the nominating convention, activities that are directly
associated with the nominee,'' Fitzwater said.
   But another White House aide, speaking privately, said Reagan
realizes he will be a target in the campaign and he will not make a
step until Bush asks him.
   ``Clearly a lot of dialogue this fall will focus on us, with the
Democrats attacking our record and the vice president supporting
it,'' the official said. ``Anything we do will be carefully
coordinated with the vice president.''
   White House political director Frank Donatelli refused to
speculate on what form Reagan's activities might take.
   But he said Reagan will not take part in any ``active
campaigning'' until after the summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. The meeting is scheduled for the second week of June.
   Rollins, who most recently worked on Jack Kemp's failed bid to
win the nomination, said that will be ``the perfect time'' for
Reagan to designate his successor.
   ``He'll come back riding high in the polls; he'll be as popular
as he's ever been,'' said Rollins.
   However, Rollins warned that the stature of the presidency could
work against Bush, as well as help him.
   ``Bush needs to put his own stamp on his campaign,'' Rollins
said. ``If Reagan is the one who gets into the debate with the
Democrats in the fall, he could overshadow Bush.''
   Both Rollins and Donatelli contend that Reagan's involvement
will help focus, not fuzz, the Republican nominee's message.
   ``Ronald Reagan might not be able to determine the future, but
he can define the present, and that's an important contribution to
make to the dialogue,'' Donatelli said, pointing out that Reagan
has referred repeatedly to the strength of the economy and low
unemployment.
   But Rollins warned that some favorite Reagan topics might well
be avoided.
   ``If the two of them go out and talk about the line-item veto
and the economic bill of rights, they'll bore everybody to death,''
he said.
   And other issues, such as the Iran-Contra affair and Edwin
Meese's legal difficulties, are likely to be ignored.
   ``If he spends the next months talking defending everything he's
done and anybody who's ever worked for him, he won't be
effective,'' Rollins said of Reagan.
   It is just such issues that will attract voters to the
Democratic side, Coelho said.
   He argued that American voters want a change and that Bush must
present himself as something different from Reagan. ``But when the
president goes out for him, it clouds Bush's message. Reagan is the
`Great Communicator,' not Bush,'' the California Democrat said.
   Coelho also argued that Reagan's approach to dealing with the
Soviets is one that is ``personally identified'' with the president
and that it has ``never transferred to George Bush.''
   ``George Bush's resume is supposedly grounded on foreign policy
as his forte and he hasn't shown that in eight years,'' Coelho said.
   Coelho also pointed out that Reagan failed when he attempted in
the 1986 campaign to keep the Senate in GOP hands. Although the
president campaigned for months, the Republicans lost eight seats.
   ``We'd encourage such participation again,'' he added with a
laugh.

<TEXT>
   Glasnost has brought challenges for the Voice
of America, the U.S. government radio station reviled for years by
the Kremlin: Now that the Soviets have stopped jamming its
broadcasts, VOA has to be more interesting.
   ``We now use more actualities and music,'' VOA director Richard
Carlson said in an interview. And instead of recycling programs
several times a day to go through despite jamming, VOA now produces
fresh material for every program.
   ``We now have to be more competitive,'' Carlson said, citing
broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corp. and the more-open
Soviet media under the glasnost _ or openness _ policies of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We have tried to make our programming more interesting, now
that people don't have to listen through eight frequencies'' of
interference.
   But the VOA hasn't softened its view of Soviet affairs.
   Editorials try to put Gorbachev's reforms ``within a realistic
context,'' Carlson said. ``Like jamming. It is intellectually
difficult to applaud people for stopping what they were not
supposed to be doing in the first place.
   ``One of the things that we have not changed is the tone and
tenor of our broadcasting. We are not being kinder to Gorbachev. We
think we have been fair all along.''
   Carlson last December returned from a 10-day tour of the Soviet
Union, the first ever by a VOA director. Charles Z. Wick, head of
the U.S. Information Agency which administers VOA, also has
traveled to the Soviet Union and Poland.
   And the head of VOA's Russian service, Gerd Von Demming, is just
back from a trip that took him to Soviet Armenia a week before
demonstrations broke out there in February.
   After they left the Soviet Union, Von Demming and a colleague,
VOA's Vienna correspondent Joylon Naegle, telephoned contacts they
made in Armenia and broadcast reports on the demonstrations there.
   Although Gorbachev has opened some doors to VOA, he still voices
the longtime Soviet complaint about ``foreign voices'' fomenting
unrest.
   ```Various radio stations, including official ones, have joined
in the subversive activity,'' Gorbachev said Tuesday. ``Especially
active ... is Deutsche Welle,'' West German radio.
   ``They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs, to
exacerbate problems from the outside, and engaging in
provocations,'' he said in remarks distributed by Tass news agency.
``At present this is particularly visible in connection with the
events around Nagorno-Karabakh,'' a scene of Armenian unrest.
   Carlson said he hopes that Kremlin ire will not torpedo VOA's
longstanding request to open a bureau in Moscow.
   ``In keeping with all the remarkably successful public relations
moves by the Soviets, we think we may win approval,'' Carlson said.
   Later this month, VOA is planning its first call-in show, in
which broadcasters will field questions relayed from Soviet
listeners dialing direct to London.
   And on Tuesday, VOA conducted its first telephone interview with
a Soviet official, Pyotr Morozov, director of the department of
scientific research at the All-Union Institute for Mental Health in
Moscow. Morozov's boss, Marat Vartanian, for years has denied
allegations that the Soviet Union incarcerated dissidents in
psychiatric hospitals.
   During the interview, said Carlson, Morozov repeated the Soviet
denials, but acknowledged that some people sentenced for criminal
offenses were treated in psychiatric hospitals.
   Soviet authorities treat political dissidents with debilitating
drugs in psychiatric hospitals, according to Peter Reddaway,
secretary of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies and
Ellen Mercer of the American Psychiatric Association. Numerous
Soviet emigre accounts also have described the practice.
   ``We have a list of more than 100 people'' who were convicted of
political crimes and sent to psychiatric hospitals, said Cathy
Fitzpatrick, of the Helsinki Watch Committee in New York.
   Carlson said VOA would combine Morozov's comments with those of
Mercer, Fitzpatrick and a Moscow-based dissident during a broadcast
to the Soviet Union next week.
   Previously, said Carlson, VOA has spoken by phone with
dissidents such as Andrei D. Sakharov, but never with an official.
   The Soviet Union jammed VOA broadcasts until 1973, when a period
of Soviet-American detente began. Jamming resumed in 1980 with the
rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in Poland.
   The Soviets stopped jamming broadcasts to the Soviet Union last
May 26, and stopped interfering with broadcasts to Poland this
January. Polish-language broadcasts had been jammed by military
transmitters inside the Soviet Union, said Carlson.
   Although the Soviets have stopped jamming broadcasts by VOA, the
BBC and Deutsche Welle, they still try to block reception of two
other U.S.-funded stations, Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.
   To reach different groups in the Soviet Union, VOA broadcasts in
a number of languages including Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azeri,
Lithuanian, Estonian, Latvian, Armenian and Georgian.
   VOA transmissions to other countries in the Soviet bloc include
broadcasts in Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian and German.

   A non-profit housing group says its new poll
shows that people are willing to pay higher taxes to ensure that
poor and middle-class Americans get decent, affordable housing.
   ``There's no doubt the American people support programs to
expand home ownership, help low-income renters and aid the
homeless,'' National Housing Institute chairman John Atlas said
Wednesday. ``And contrary to the conventional wisdom, they're
willing to pay.''
   The poll found that most Americans believe there is a lack of
affordable housing for the poor and middle class. Most of those
surveyed said they would pay an extra $10 to $15 a month in taxes
for programs to aid the homeless, the elderly and middle-class
families unable to make down payments to buy houses.
   The survey also found that nearly 75 percent of the American
public believes a presidential candidate who advocates housing
programs for middle-and working-class families ``understands the
real needs in America.''
   The vast majority _ 86 percent _ said they feel homelessness is
``a national disgrace'' and an even higher percentage _ 93 percent
_ said homelessness is an important problem that should be
eliminated.
   ``Politically, a presidential candidate who guarantees every
American a decent affordable home might have a new home himself _
on Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Atlas said.
   The report, ``A Status Report On The American Dream: How the
American People View Housing Problems and Programs Today,'' was
based on polling by R L Associates of Princeton, N.J. The firm
interviewed 1,001 adults by telephone during February and March.
Michael Rappaport, spokesman for the polling firm, said the margin
of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   In general, the survey found that at least two-thirds of those
questioned support programs to finance renovations in housing for
the elderly, to rehabilitate old and vacant buildings, to establish
a homeless prevention program to help those close to eviction for
financial reasons, and to begin a mortgage assistance program to
help with downpayments.
   On the issue of higher taxes to support housing programs, 66
percent said they would be willing to spend $10 a month more, while
55 percent said they would agree to pay $15 a month more.
   The poll also found that half of those surveyed said they would
be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports ``a package of
housing programs,'' while only 6 percent said they would be less
likely to support such a candidate.
   Seventy-four percent said they believe a presidential candidate
who advocates housing programs for middle- and working-class
families ``understands the real needs in America.''
   ``The American people are increasingly aware that this nation
faces a housing problem,'' Atlas said. ``Our poll shows that
Americans understand that it's hard to find affordable housing and
that Americans are shocked at homelessness.''
   He said the housing institute, which describes itself as a
representative of housing interests for moderate- and low-income
families, cannot lobby Congress for housing programs because of its
non-profit status. It does plan to provide its poll data to other
groups that can promote the programs.
   Atlas said spending authority for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development dropped 57 percent from 1980 to 1987, from $35.7
billion a year to $15.2 billion. And he said that the HUD budget
last year represented 1 percent of the federal budget.

<HEAD>Only Half Of Adults Use Their Computers, Survey Says</HEAD>

   Only about half the adults who have a computer
at home actually use it as opposed to nearly three-quarters of all
children, the Census Bureau reports.
   Youngsters use computers for learning and for games, and many
children are also exposed to the machines in school, said bureau
statistician Robert Kominski, whose survey was released Wednesday.
   Even though many adults use computers at work, the home computer
may have been bought by one adult for a specific use, and not be of
interest to others in the home, Kominski suggested.
   In addition, many computers were bought ``as learning tools and
game machines for children,'' he said. ``So there probably are
quite a few situations in households where children use a computer
and not the adults at all.''
   The report was based on a survey taken in October 1984, the only
time the bureau has looked at computer use. The report was delayed
because of other priorities, he said.
   Computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million home
computers in use at the time of the survey.
   International Data Corp., a Boston-based market research group,
estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly
16.5 million as of last year.
   And Electronic Industries Association, a trade group, estimates
the total at 17.6 million homes as of January.
   While it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use, the
census analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses the
machines.
   Of 221 million Americans aged 3 and over in 1984, more than one
in five _ 21.1 percent _ reported using computers in some direct
way.
   _Some 8.2 percent of households (6.9 million) owned a home
computer.
   Ownership was most likely in households with incomes of $50,000
or more, 22.9 percent. Only 1.7 percent of households with incomes
under $10,000 had a computer.
   People aged 34 to 44 were most likely to own computers. Those
with children were three times more likely to have a machine than
were the childless.
   _Of the 15 million adults in computer households, 53.3 percent
reported using the machine. Use by men was 63.1 percent, compared
to 48.2 percent of women. Usage was highest in the 25 to 34 age
group.
   Adults in the West and Northeast were most likely to have a
computer at home, 10.3 percent and 10.2 percent respectively. But
westerners were much more likely to use them, 57.9 percent to 49.8
percent.
   In the Midwest, 8.9 percent of adults had a home computer and
54.5 percent of them used it. The rates were 7.7 percent of adults
in the South with a computer and 51.6 percent using it.
   _Nearly one-fourth, 24.6 percent of all employed adults, used a
computer at work. Reversing the home pattern, women were more
likely to use them there, 29.0 percent to 21.2 percent.
   The highest rate of use was 39.1 percent of women in technical
and support jobs, while the top rate for men was 38.6 percent in
administrative and management positions.
   _Among children aged 3 to 17, 15.3 percent had a computer at
home, and 74.2 percent of those used it. Of those enrolled in
school, 28 percent reported using computers.
   Among youngsters, the study found, boys generally use computers
more than girls.
   ``If you want to risk saying anything is a sociocultural
difference at this time, that's certainly where it lies,'' Kominski
said. ``People who study computer games find boys use these things
much more than girls do, they go to video parlors more, and they
use computers more at home and school too.''
   In school, the highest usage was in the Midwest where 33.9
percent of students said they had computers. The rate was 30.8
percent in the Northeast, 29.4 percent in the West and 21.3 percent
in the South.

   Three years ago, Paul Walton set up a card
table on a downtown street corner here to preach the benefits of
long-distance telephone competition and sign up customers for a
company called US Telecom.
   The 32-year-old San Diego entrepreneur returned to that street
corner Wednesday to tell customers, shareholders and anyone else
who would listen that the company, now called US Sprint
Communications Co., is plagued by billing and management problems
that are costing millions in lost business.
   Walton, who says he signed up more than 600,000 residential
customers for US Sprint, has been waging an unusual grass-roots
campaign to oust the company's management and install himself as
president to clean house.
   ``I'm appealing to customers and shareholders not to rely on the
present management to correct the problems,'' Walton said in an
interview before a speech to a curious lunchtime crowd outside the
Federal Communications Commission's headquarters.
   ``Management has been totally unresponsive'' to the problems,
which Walton says cost him millions in lost commissions for his
sales efforts as well as millions in lost business for the company.
   US Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, has
acknowledged its billing problems and admitted that bad debt has
contributed to the company's losses. Spokesman Syd Courson said the
firm plans to have new computer software installed by January to
take care of the problem.
   ``We've owned up to our billing problems and we've done a lot to
correct them,'' Courson said, adding that Walton has become a
``nuisance.''
   Last week, Walton took his entourage _ complete with a large
campaign banner _ to Los Angeles, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago and
Atlanta. This week he touched down in San Francisco and Denver
before arriving in Washington.
   All this is leading up to ``election'' appeals he hopes to make
personally to shareholders at meetings April 12 for United
Telecommunications Inc. in Kansas City and April 20 for GTE Corp.
in Stamford, Conn. US Sprint was formed as a joint venture by those
two companies in July 1986.
   But he faces one big stumbling block: Shareholders do not elect
the president.
   Shareholders, however, can raise issues like his at annual
meetings, and since he owns United Telecommunications stock, he can
make comments at that meeting. ``But since there is no election, I
don't know what his purpose is,'' said United Telecommunications
spokesman Don Forsythe. Walton is not a GTE shareholder.
   Walton worked as an independent sales contractor for US Telecom
and US Sprint from 1984 to 1986. During that period, the former
high school teacher hired a sales force of about 400 young people
who worked street corners and college campuses across the country,
signing up new customers.
   But many of those they signed up never got service, were billed
for calls never made, never received bills from US Sprint but were
contacted by collection agencies or had other problems with
service, he said.
   For Walton, this meant problems receiving his commissions. He
was supposed to be credited when customers made their first US
Sprint calls. But because of problems installing service and
billing customers, Walton estimated that about half his recruits
were never counted for a commission.
   After his contract with US Sprint was ended in September 1986,
Walton wrote scores of letters to US Sprint executives about his
lost commissions and the company's billing problems.
   At the time, Walton said, the company owed him between $3
million and $8 million in unpaid commissions. He eventually settled
for nearly $2 million, including a $1.7 million payment in January.
   In total, he said he received about $6 million from US Sprint
during his 2{ years of recruiting. He said he paid close to $5
million of that to his young workers.
   But Walton says it is not the money that is driving his campaign
to oust US Sprint President Robert H. Snedaker.
   ``My integrity is at stake,'' Walton said. ``I wanted to make
more money and feel good about it at the same time.''

<HEAD>Black Explorer Given Full Recognition 79 Years Later</HEAD>

   They were together at the discovery of the
North Pole in 1909. But in death, Matthew Alexander Henson was in a
shared grave in New York while Adm. Robert E. Peary was honored at
Arlington National Cemetery.
   Henson was black, and for that reason, said supporter Dr. S.
Allen Counter, ``he was denied proper recognition because of the
racial attitudes of his time.''
   On Wednesday, 79 years to the day after Henson planted the
American flag on the North Pole, the two explorers were reunited as
Henson's remains and those of his wife were reinterred with full
military honors at Arlington.
   ``Now, finally, Matthew Henson and Robert Peary can talk about
old days out there,'' a part-Eskimo grandson, Qitdlaq Henson of
Qaanaaq, Greenland, said through a translator _ his cousin Navarana
Harper _ at a news conference following the ceremony.
   ``I have waited for this day for over 30 years,'' Henson's great
niece, Olive Henson Fulton of Roxbury, Mass., told the gathering of
about 100 relatives and admirers at the windswept hilltop burial
site.
   Recalling that she was expelled from school because she had
written a paper about Henson when her assignment had been to write
about a hero, Ms. Fulton said: ``Finally, my uncle is given his
place in history.''
   Counter said the reinterment of Henson and his wife, Lucy Ross
Henson, was ``long overdue recognition for our hero ... (that
would) right a tragic wrong.''
   ``Welcome home, Matthew Henson,'' he said. ``Welcome home to a
new day in America. ... May your presence here inspire generations
of explorers.''
   Last October, President Reagan approved Counter's petition to
allow Henson's remains to be reinterred at Arlington. He had been
buried in 1955 in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York.
   Among those honoring Henson at the ceremony were Gen. Julius
Beckton of the White House military office, who conveyed greetings
from Reagan; John H. Johnson, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Johnson Publishing Co., which publishes Ebony and Jet
magazines; Col. Guion S. Bluford, the first black astronaut; and
Dorothy Height, the president of the National Council of Negro
Women.
   Counter, an associate professor of neurophysiology at Harvard
University who previously had brought together Henson's and Peary's
part-Eskimo offspring, said Peary had insisted before his own death
in 1920 that Henson's achievements be recognized.
   Descendants of Matthew and Lucy Henson were joined at the
ceremony by Henson's part-Eskimo descendants.
   ``This is a very special day for them,'' Ms. Harper said at the
news conference, translating for another of Henson's grandsons,
Ajako Henson of Morriussaq, Greenland. ``They don't even know how
to express that.''
   Henson's eldest part-Eskimo grandson, Avataq Henson, also of
Morriussaq, clutched to his chest the flag that had draped his
grandfather's coffin.
   ``When he visited Matthew Henson's grave the first time in
Woodlawn Cemetery in New York, he expected it to be a hero's
gravesite,'' Ms. Harper said as she translated for Avataq. ``He was
disappointed to see him among ordinary people.''

<HEAD>Bush Bumps Up Against Fund-Raising Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's campaign treasury is filled to
the brim and campaign officials say the biggest worry now is
guarding against spending more than the $27 million pre-convention
limit set by federal election law.
   The vice president's campaign has already spent all but $4
million of that cap, with more than four months yet to go to the
Republican convention this August, said campaign treasurer Fred
Bush.
   The Bush campaign hit the contribution limit on Wednesday,
reporting that it had raised a total of $30 million, including
$22.5 million in direct contributions and commitments for another
$7.5 million in federal matching funds.
   This total includes about $3 million earmarked for legal and
accounting expenses which are exempt from the $27 million-limit.
   ``The challenge is to take that $4 million we have left and
maximize it so that George Bush gets the best benefit out of that
he can,'' said the campaign official, who is not related to
candidate Bush.
   ``I'm thrilled,'' Fred Bush said in an interview. ``As far as
this process is concerned, we're finished.''
   The cap applies to both raising funds and spending them.
   GOP contender Pat Robertson was the first candidate to actually
bump up against the spending ceiling.
   The former televison evangelist said after the costly Super
Tuesday contests on March 8 that he was within $2 million of the
spending cap. Since then he has laid off staff and dropped an
extensive television marketing operation. Though he has only 17
delegates to Bush's 888, he remains in the race and is spending the
rest of his money primarily on personal travel.
   Fred Bush said staying within the limits is far easier because
Bush is now running virtually unopposed among Republicans.
   ``It's a fait accompli as far as the nomination. You don't have
to go on advertising, you don't have to buy more TV ads, you don't
have to have a huge entourage,'' he said.
   The vice president had already scaled down his campaign schedule
in the aftermath of Sen. Bob Dole's withdrawal last week from the
race.
   The vice president plans to go ahead with fund-raising events
scheduled for this weekend in Texas and Florida, next week in New
York and Connecticut and later in the month in Washington, D.C.
   The reason? Fred Bush said that the campaign is still entitled
to raise another $2.8 million to go into a ``compliance fund,''
money needed for complying with various provisions enforced by the
Federal Election Commission.
   He said the campaign will still continue to raise funds until
that $2.8 million has been met, and then will close up its
fund-raising operation.
   Funds for the general election campaign are provided from tax
dollars and from a ``presidential trust'' _ funds that can be
raised and spent by the national parties on behalf of their
nominees.
   Fred Bush said contributors who have written checks to the
George Bush campaign that haven't yet been cashed soon will be
receiving letters.
   ``We will write those people and explain to them that we are
over the legal maximum, and would they allow us to use that check
for the compliance fund. We have to have their signature.
Otherwise, we will have to return the check.''
   ``I think it will be a pretty easy $2.8 million to raise,'' he
added.

<HEAD>Democrats Look To New York To Annoint Front-Runner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party leaders are looking to New
York and asking if Michael Dukakis can extend his winning streak to
four _ and finally give the party a presidential front-runner.
   While many Democrats were sounding optimistic about the
prospects of a breakthrough in the long, roller-coaster race, they
also were painfully aware of the many occasions one or another
candidate looked on the verge of claiming the title of front-runner.
   ``Every time we get a front-runner, it seems folks want to slow
it down,'' said John C. White, a former national party chairman who
is advising Jesse Jackson.
   Watching most closely are those elected and party officials _
645 strong _ designated as uncommitted delegates to the Democratic
National Convention, the so-called super delegates expected to hold
the balance of power.
   ``The super delegates are looking for a candidate who can rattle
off a big string of wins,'' said Rick Wiener, Michigan Democratic
Party chairman.
   It was in Michigan's caucuses in March 26 that Jackson trounced
Dukakis and surged to the forefront of the contest, raising talk of
the likelihood of a brokered convention. Michigan came shortly
after a Dukakis loss in Illinois.
   But since then, the Massachusetts governor has scored victories
in Connecticut, Colorado and Wisconsin and now is favored to extend
his streak in New York which holds its primary on April 19.
   ``The nominee will be determined in New York and Pennsylvania,''
said Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the American
Federation of Teachers and a member of the Democratic National
Committee. ``I think we have a two-person race and we have a
front-runner. The likelihood is we'll have a nominee and not a
brokered convention.''
   The Wisconsin vote ``gives a little boost to Dukakis,'' said
Joseph Crangle, Erie County, N.Y. Democratic chairman, and one of
the party's super delegates. ``But you've got to put a qualifying
clause there that you've got to have a pattern, you've got to go
two or three states in a row in order to say that you're a
front-runner.''
   Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. predicted the Democrats would
choose their nominee on the first ballot of the Atlanta convention
and he vowed to oppose any effort to organize a stop-Jackson
movement.
   ``There's not going to be any organized cabal of party leaders
trying to hobble one candidate as opposed to another,'' said Kirk.
   A total of 2,082 delegates is needed for a convention majority.
To reach that number, either Dukakis or Jackson would need to win
more than 1,300 of the 1,600-plus committed delegates yet to be
chosen or draw strong support from the super delegates.
   ``The super delegates are going to stay frozen for a while,''
predicted White.
   Wiener said the super delegates were ``looking for a candidate
who can rattle off a big string of wins.'' He said most of those
delegates accept the view that ``if there is a clear leader after
California and New Jersey (the last two big states to hold
primaries), that super delegates ought to play a leading role in
propelling that person over the top. At three in a row, Gov.
Dukakis has gotten a very good start on that.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Prosecution Plan For Release Of Documents Too
Cumbersome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case says he
wants to streamline procedures for pre-trial disclosure of 150,000
pages of classified documents to the four defendants.
   Signaling his intention to move the case to trial as quickly as
possible, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Wednesday
rejected independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's proposal to
prevent unauthorized disclosure of the classified material as too
cumbersome.
   The proposed procedure for three months of pre-trial discovery
``appears to be far too complex, lacks definite time restrictions
and creates undue obstacles to the fair and expeditious disposition
of this case,'' Gesell said in a brief opinion.
   At a hearing scheduled for next Tuesday, Gesell said he
``intends to determine the timing of discovery disclosures in
relation to a realistic trial date.''
   Gesell said he will ask Walsh to say which documents ``will be
made available immediately'' to the defense. Walsh had said in
pleadings filed Monday that he planned to turn over the material to
the defendants in the next three months.
   The judge also said he wants to set a deadline this month for
completion of an interagency review of the documents, which Walsh
says ``describe in detail some of the nation's most carefully held
secrets about its foreign policy, its intelligence activities and
its covert activities.''
   An objection to Walsh's plan was filed by defense lawyers for
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.
   The four are accused of conspiring to illegally divert proceeds
from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Among elements of the security plan the defense found
objectionable was a requirement that the defendants and their
lawyers answer detailed government questionnaires in order to
obtain security clearances to review the documents.
   Requiring the defendants to answer detailed questions about
their travel, aliases, corporate affiliations ``and other matters
potentially at issue in the case'' could violate their Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination, the defense said.
   The joint opposition also noted that North and Poindexter had
previously had access to many of the documents when they worked at
the National Security Council.
   Gesell said ``it will be necessary to frame a more limited
protective order fashioned to the nature of this case, which in
essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified
materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.''

<HEAD>Bush, Dole Meet To Discuss ``Beating Democrats''</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 3 grafs with Robertson saying he won't campaign actively

   Vice President George Bush met Wednesday with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, his vanquished rival for the
Republican presidential nomination, in their first private session
since a stormy confrontation in February on the Senate floor.
   Bush told reporters that the men had a ``good, friendly
discussion'' during which they talked ``about how to beat
Democrats.''
   The meeting, held in the Capitol, followed an earlier session in
the same building between Dole and Pat Robertson. The former
television evangelist is continuing his quest for the GOP
presidential nomination but has all but conceded that Bush will be
his party's selection.
   Asked after his meeting with Bush whether the two men had buried
the hatchet, Dole said, ``I don't have a hatchet. I'm a nice
fellow.''
   Bush said he envisioned a role for Dole in the general election
in which the Kansan would work ``as much as he possibly has time to
give. A lot of it's here and a lot of it I hope will be around the
country.''
   Dole said that Bush had asked for the meeting and said the
discussion was ``about getting George elected in November.''
   Dole spokesman Walt Riker said later that the men talked about
``keeping the Republican nomination interesting until the
convention'' in August and ``ways to get the issues out there.''
   In an unusual floor confrontation Feb. 4 amid a Contra aid vote,
Dole accused Bush of condoning a campaign attack that amounted to
``groveling in the mud.''
   The face-off was sparked by a Bush campaign statement headlined
``Dole's cronyism and mean-spiritedness questioned.'' The statement
by an Iowa aide implied that Dole accepted favors from the wealthy
and said three federal agencies were examining a defunct blind
trust once held by his wife, former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Hanford Dole.
   Dole called the statement ``nasty, mean, personal and
vindictive.'' Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said Dole was
over-reacting and behaving like ``a typical schoolyard bully _ he
can dish it out, but if someone hits him back, he starts whining.''
   The incident epitomized the bitterness of the campaign between
the two men. But Dole dropped out of the race and endorsed Bush
last month.
   After his meeting with Dole, Robertson said he would stay in the
race until he was assured that the GOP platform would be
conservative enough to keep his supporters active in the campaign.
He promised he would be loyal to the party's candidate.
   ``There's no question that we plan to support the Republican
nominee, and it looks as though it's going to be George Bush,''
Robertson said.
   Robertson said he wanted to be ``a rallying point for
conservatives'' at the GOP convention in New Orleans so he could
encourage his supporters to remain involved in Republican politics.
   ``I want to make sure that it's the type of platform that will
make them get in with both hands and both feet and go to work,'' he
said.
   Robertson told The New York Times he would not campaign in New
York before the April 19 primary, and said he would ask for the
termination of his Secret Service protection.
   In an interview published in Thursday's editions of the paper,
he said it would be ``more quixotic than it is realistic'' to
continue actively campaigning.
   Robertson had already laid off most of his campaign staff and
has made only a few campaign appearances recently, because he is
bumping up against federal campaign spending limits.

<HEAD>New Laws Urged For Those Who Act To Spread AIDS Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The need to protect against people with the
AIDS virus who knowingly try to spread the disease must be balanced
against the need to protect individual rights, a public health
expert told the White House AIDS commission.
   ``An isolation statute could require a due process determination
that a viral carrier is unwilling or unable to refrain from
engaging in conduct likely to spread the disease,'' Larry Gostin
testified Wednesday before the panel.
   ``Constitutionally allowable isolation would not focus on a
person's status as having an infection or a disease, but upon his
or her behavior leading to transmission,'' said Gostin.
   Gostin, executive director of the American Society of Law &
Medicine and associate professor at the Harvard School of Public
Health, was among 28 witnesses appearing before the panel in two
days of hearings this week.
   The commission, working toward a June 24 final report, has
scheduled three more days of hearings later this month.
   A Michigan prosecutor told the commission that existing laws are
inadequate to deal with people who know they are infected with the
virus and behave in a manner that could spread it to others.
   ``The citizens of this country deserve protection from being
recklessly or intentionally targeted for exposure to this dreadful
disease,'' said Robert E. Weiss of Flint, Mich.
   Weiss, the elected prosecuting attorney in Genesee County,
explained his rationale for filing assault with intent to murder
charges against a man infected with the virus who tried to spit on
police after being arrested for drunken driving.
   ``He fought with the arresting officers and, once lodged, kept
spitting through the bars of his cell, taunting the officers and
daring them to come closer so he `could give them AIDS,''' said
Weiss.
   ``We filed ... under the theory that his expressed intention to
communicate an incurable, terminal disease amounted to an intent to
cause death,'' he explained.
   The court reduced the attempted murder charge to assault on an
officer, partially on grounds there is insufficient evidence that
the virus can be spread by spitting, said Weiss.
   He said that although the ``percentage of AIDS carriers who will
maliciously or irresponsibly place others at risk is largely
speculative, this fact should not deter us from developing a
legislative framework to control such conduct.''

<HEAD>Peugeot Shows High Head-Injury Potential, NHTSA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says crash tests of nine 1988 vehicles show drivers
of the Peugeot 505 GLS have the greatest chance of sustaining a
head injury.
   A 35 mph crash of the four-door compact into a fixed barrier
produced a head-injury criterion of 1701 on the driver, the highest
recorded among this year's tests.
   The head-injury criterion is an index of the force experienced
by occupants of the car, as measured by a test dummy. The
passenger-side dummy recorded a head-injury criterion of 1457.
   The Peugeot results were among six released Wednesday by NHTSA.
The agency had tested three vehicles earlier in the year.
   The Toyota Corolla FX two-door hatchback, a subcompact, produced
a head-injury criterion of 593 for the driver, and 397 for the
passenger. The driver head-injury criterion was the least among the
nine models tested this year.
   A second subcompact, the Toyota Tercel two-door hatchback,
produced a head-injury criterion of 1005 for the driver and 398 for
the passenger.
   In compact car crash tests, the Nissan Maxima SE four-door
produced a head-injury criteria of 907 for the driver and 861 for
the passenger, and the Pontiac Le Mans two-door Aerocoupe produced
head-injury criteria of 819 for the driver and 897 for the
passenger.
   Wednesday's test results included one van, the Volkswagen
Vanagon, with head-injury criteria of 1320 for the driver and 899
for the passenger.
   Earlier, NHTSA had released test results on the 1988 Volkswagen
Fox, Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.
   The crash-test results are intended to help consumers compare
vehicles when deciding which to buy, NHTSA said. Only one vehicle
of each model is tested, and further crash tests could produce
different results, NHTSA said.
   The 35 mph crash speed was 5 mph faster, or one-third more
severe, than that specified by federal motor vehicle safety
standards. The 30 mph standards permit a maximum head-injury
criterion of 1000, and higher figures can be expected at the higher
speed, NHTSA said.

   Two local Republicans riding with George Bush in
the vice presidential limousine were serving as a welcoming
committee _ but Bush wanted to talk business.
   ``If Dukakis wins this thing on the other side, you guys are
going to have to help me in setting the record straight,'' Bush
told them as his motorcade wound through narrow city streets from
the Coast Guard station in Boston's North End to a political rally
at Faneuil Hall.
   The vice president was talking about Massachusetts Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis, who has a strong shot at facing Bush in the general
election next fall. Bush wanted to make sure he knows the full
details of the governor's record, said state Sen. Paul Cellucci,
who sat next to Bush.
   Riding in the jump seat was state Sen. David Locke, who along
with Cellucci is co-chairman of the Bush campaign in Massachusetts.
   ``If we can help you understand the Dukakis philosophy, we will
do that,'' Locke told Bush.
   That conversation, as recalled by the two senators, occurred
Feb. 24, two weeks before Bush's Super Tuesday landslide. Since
then, his principal rival, Bob Dole, has bowed out.
   With the nomination virtually locked up, Bush is plotting
strategy against the Democrats.
   Dukakis, whose treasury and organization far outstrip those of
the other Democrats, has drawn by far the most attention. With
three wins in a row under his belt _ in Connecticut, Colorado and
Wisconsin _ he is well positioned for the New York primary later
this month.
   In addition, Dukakis is the only Democrat who competes well
against Bush in hypothetical matchups in recent public opinion
polls.
   ``There's a perception within the Bush campaign that Dukakis is
in a strong position to win it,'' Cellucci said. ``We're compiling
data that will indicate that the governor did not have much to do
with the strong economy in Massachusetts.''
   He maintained that military spending, tax cuts, a property tax
limitation law and Reaganomics are responsible.
   ``We also want to be in a position where the vice president can
demonstrate that Mike Dukakis is a liberal and he believes in big
government,'' Cellucci said. ``I don't think that's anything that's
going to be too difficult to demonstrate.''
   Dukakis, Cellucci said, has been ``trying to move to the
middle'' by touting his own tax reductions, his record of balancing
budgets and his opposition to communist expansion in Central
America. But Cellucci said, ``the change is so startling and
dramatic that you have to question its sincerity.''
   The intelligence-gathering effort on Dukakis is not limited to
the material Locke and Cellucci can provide.
   The Republican National Committee, which looks into the
background of all the Democratic candidates, has had a researcher
assigned to Dukakis for nearly a year, according to RNC spokesman
Albert Maruggi. The researcher spent a full week at Republican
state committee headquarters in Boston poring over clippings, files
and old speeches.
   The RNC now has an extensive computer file at its fingertips
into which key words like ``taxes,'' ``budgets'' and ``welfare''
can be punched to yield whatever Dukakis has said on the subjects.
   Citizens for Limited Taxation, a conservative taxpayer advocacy
group in Boston, has distributed a 60-page information packet to
reporters, Republican researchers and operatives for Dukakis'
Democratic opponents.
   The packet _ color-coded by issues _ includes newspaper
clippings with headlines like, ``Tax cut is vetoed by Dukakis,''
and ``Report downplays Dukakis impact on economy.''

<HEAD>Kidnapping or Extradition? Overseas Drug Arrests Prompt Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

   Drug agents jokingly refer to it as ``Mexican
extradition.'' Courts use the more dignified term, ``informal
rendition.'' Defense attorneys call it just plain kidnapping.
   Whatever name you use, U.S. authorities flexing the long arm of
their law have had several successes luring, spiriting or forcing
criminal suspects out of seeming safe havens abroad into custody in
America.
   It happened last year to an Arab who fell prey to an FBI ruse
and ended up in custody to await trial in a 1985 Beirut plane
hijacking; to Edwin Wilson, a former CIA agent accused of selling
weapons to Libya, and to Dr. Timothy Leary, the drug cultists' icon
of the 1960s who was tracked down in Afghanistan after escaping
from a California jail.
   The most recent example occurred Tuesday, when a month-long
U.S.-Honduran operation led to the unwilling odyssey of alleged
international cocaine czar Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros from his
home in Honduras to a jail in Illinois.
   Honduran police abetted by U.S. marshals arrested Matta and put
him on a plane to the Dominican Republic, where he was hustled to a
flight bound for New York and shipped to a federal penitentiary in
Marion, Ill., U.S. officials said.
   Matta, who holds Colombian and Honduran citizenship, was wanted
on drug charges in the United States and was sought for questioning
in the murder of a U.S. Drug Enforcement agent in Mexico.
   One law enforcement official described Matta as being
``stunned'' to find himself in the United States, as the result of
an operation apparently designed to get around Honduran law.
   The United States has extradition treaties with more than 100
countries, but many nations like Honduras do not extradite their
nationals. Even when they do, or if a U.S. citizen is involved, the
legal proceedings are sometimes long and often fruitless.
   There are surer ways to bring a suspect to the United States,
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Wednesday. One
method, as in the Matta case, is to get foreign governments to
cooperate with U.S. authorities to arrange a transfer.
   Or the suspect is lured back without foreign help.
   There have been some dramatic examples.
   Last year, according to the FBI, undercover agents tracking
Fawaz Younis, a suspect in the hijacking of a Jordanian aircraft,
tricked him into going aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea and
arrested him under a U.S. law giving American courts jurisdiction
to try suspected terrorists who act against U.S. citizens. Younis
is awaiting trial in Washington.
   In 1982, former CIA agent Wilson, who had fled to Libya after
being indicted on weapons sales charges, was duped by an
acquaintance into flying to the Dominican Republic.
   Authorities there put him on a non-stop flight to the United
States, where he was arrested.
   Leary, who escaped in 1970 from a California jail, was turned
over to U.S. narcotics agents in Afghanistan even though the two
countries had no extradition treaty.
   In a case that did involve extradition, Carlos Lehder, a
Colombian wanted in connection with a massive drug conspiracy, was
flown to Florida last year to stand trial on narcotics charges.
   The DEA, which has 65 offices in 43 countries, is especially
active in what it calls ``cop-to-cop'' arrangements with foreign
police agencies.
   Turning suspects over to U.S. authorities without formal
proceedings is often called ``Mexican extradition,'' from the
tradition of authorities in that country taking people to the U.S.
border and sending them across the line into the waiting arms of
American police.
   The legal term is ``informal rendition,'' a U.S. government
attorney said. ``We find someone in another country who is wanted
here. We go to the authorities and say we're interested in the
person. They kick him out by putting him on a plane to the United
States, and that's it.''
   He said it was not clear how many suspects come to the United
States each year by such means.
   Defense attorneys in some of the celebrated cases _ notably the
Wilson and Younis cases _ have sought dismissal of charges on
grounds the overseas arrests violated the defendant's rights by, in
effect, kidnapping them.
   Appeals courts, however, have upheld the prosecutions in most
cases, saying they are not particularly concerned about execution
of the laws in foreign countries or how defendants got to the
United States.
   The only exception, based on a ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, would be a case in which the manner of a
suspect's arrest and arrival in U.S. custody ``shocked the
conscience'' of the court.
   Under that rule, the government could lose a case if the suspect
proves he was tortured or otherwise severely mistreated in being
arrested. Younis, who arrived in the United States with two broken
wrists after being arrested by the FBI, is making such a claim.
   Sometimes, information supplied by U.S. authorities leads to
extradition between two other countries.
   In their investigation of the 1985 murder of DEA agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar in Guadalajara, Mexico, U.S. authorities informed
Costa Rican police that a suspect, Rafael Caro-Quintero, was living
in Costa Rica.
   He was arrested there and extradited to Mexico to stand trial.

   The Chateau of Vincennes, the former royal palace
where Louis XIV spent his honeymoon, will be renovated, the
government said.
   ``The chateau, as it stands, is a discouraging site,'' said
former culture minister Jean-Philippe Lecat, head of the renovation
committee.
   The government announced Wednesday that the fortress will be
renovated. Lecat proposed a five-year, $30 million plan to turn the
picturesque complex into a cultural facility to accomodate about
400,000 visitors yearly.
   The castle currently receives about 30,000 visitors each year.
   Completed in 1370 by King Charles V, the castle originally was
conceived as the cornerstone of a vast royal city he planned to
control.
   Centuries later the young Louis XIV spent his honeymoon there
but he preferred to live in Fontainebleau and Versailles.

<HEAD>Contempt Citations Sought Against Reagan Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contempt citations are being sought against
White House budget chief James Miller and Assistant Labor Secretary
John Pendergrass on a claim they are illegally blocking
court-ordered warnings to 18 million American workers about toxic
chemicals.
   The United Steelworkers union filed suit against the two Reagan
administration officials Wednesday in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia, which ordered the warnings last year.
   Under ``right-to-know'' regulations ordered last May by the
court and issued in August by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration headed by Pendergrass, the Labor Department was
scheduled to begin levying fines of up to $10,000 when the warnings
are absent.
   However, the Office of Management and Budget headed by Miller
has delayed implementation of the new requirements. The budget
office claims some of the provisions run contrary to the 1980
Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the mounting number of forms that
the government requires businesses to handle.
   In addition to the contempt citations, the Steelworkers want a
court order fully implementing the regulations as issued last
August by OSHA and an injunction prohibiting the administration
from taking any further action to thwart them.
   Barbara Clay, a spokeswoman for the budget office, said
officials have not seen the suit yet and, therefore, had no comment
on it.
   The Philadelphia appeals court is the same one that last May
ordered Pendergrass to issue the regulations or face a contempt
citation then.
   The regulations require employers in several industries to make
sure warning labels are on some 600,000 hazardous chemical products
in an estimated 3.5 million workplaces employing 18 million workers.
   Administration officials have repeatedly cited the regulations
as negating the need for the government to warn workers
individually about health risks from exposure to carcinogens and
other toxic substances.
   Those arguments were instrumental last week in the Senate's
defeat of a House-passed bill that would have required individual
warnings from the government to go out annually to some 300,000
workers judged to be at the greatest risk.
   The American Cancer Society had estimated those individual
warnings and medical monitoring programs based on them would have
prevented 250,000 cancer deaths over the next 10 years.
   OSHA estimated that the ``right-to-know'' regulations would
reduce chemically related injuries, illnesses and deaths in
non-manufacturing industries by 20 percent a year.
   The regulations were recommended in 1975 by a federal advisory
commission to combat the annual 100,000 deaths and 340,000
disabling illnesses and injuries blamed on occupational diseases.
   Formally known as the Hazard Communication Standard, the
warnings were imposed by OSHA on the chemical industry and its 1.4
million workers in 1985.
   A year later, under court orders in response to an earlier suit
by the Steelworkers union, they were expanded to cover 14 million
more workers employed by some 300,000 manufacturers.
   Then the Philadelphia federal appeals court last May ordered
OSHA to expand the requirements further to protect the 18 million
workers in agriculture, construction, services, transportation and
office occupations.
   ``We'd thought that after a decade of litigation, we had won
this fight,'' Margaret Seminario, a job health and safety
specialist for the AFL-CIO, said Wednesday. ``Now OMB through the
back door is trying to negate it all.''
   The regulations do not ban any hazardous substances or order any
reductions in exposure. However they do require employers to post
data sheets offering information on each hazardous product and to
train workers on proper safeguards.
   The White House budget office has demanded that construction
sites be excluded from the data sheet requirements.
   And, in response to complaints from the formaldehyde industry,
it also has disapproved language requiring warnings on building
materials and permanent-press fabrics treated with that chemical
when they are shipped to apparel manufacturers.
   While many employers had sought the regulations because they
pre-empt state and local right-to-know laws that often were more
stringent, others opposed them out of fears of potential lawsuits.
   ``Documentary evidence has hung many a king, politician,
financial wizard, whatever,'' said Robert Moran, a private
Washington attorney who specializes in workplace health and safety
issues. ``And that's what this regulation provides.''

<HEAD>Shultz Meeting East German, Bulgarian Leaders This Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-ranking officials of East Germany and
Bulgaria, long regarded among Moscow's staunchest allies, have
dates in the coming weeks with Secretary of State George Shultz.
   They are Herman Axen, a member of East Berlin's ruling
politburo, and Andrei Lukanov, Bulgarian minister of foreign
economic relations and alternate politburo member. Both are
described by U.S. officials as the highest-ranking members of their
respective communist hierarchies ever to visit Washington.
   U.S. and East German sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a May 3 meeting between Shultz and Axen was
arranged after the East German leader was invited to speak May 4 at
the Johns Hopkins University Institute for Contemporary German
Studies.
   Axen holds no office in the East German government, but is the
top international affairs officer of the Socialist Unity Party, the
official name of the governing communist organization.
   Lukanov is scheduled to meet Shultz during an April 25-26 visit
to Washington, followed by a coast-to-coast trade promotion tour
with a high-level delegation. Noted as an economic reformer,
Lukanov will be the first senior Bulgarian cabinet minister in
Washington since World War II.
   Since 1984, the State Department has focused overtures toward
Moscow's East European allies on human rights and economic issues.
   Over the past two years, Deputy Secretary of State John C.
Whitehead has told leaders in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary that U.S. readiness to expand
commercial ties will depend on their willingness to strengthen
respect for human rights.
   The U.S. source said that during Axen's talks, State Department
officials will renew pleas for more religious freedom in East
Germany. That country last year allowed two massive religious
assemblies and permitted the Jewish community to install its first
rabbi since 1967. In recent weeks, however, there has been a
crackdown on environmental groups affiliated with churches, the
official said.
   In talks with Lukanov, the State Department is expected to
request better treatment of Bulgaria's sizable Turkish and Islamic
minorities.
   Lukanov, accompanied by two deputy ministers, the chairman of
the foreign trade bank and presidents of several leading Bulgarian
foreign trade companies, has been invited to an April 25
question-and-answer session at U.S. Chamber of Commerce
headquarters in Washington.
   Lukanov ``has a reputation throughout West and East Europe for
his creative mind and ability to articulate issues,'' the chamber
said in its announcement. Formerly deputy prime minister, he
assumed the new post of minister of foreign economic relations last
Jan. 1 ``in recognition of the importance Bulgaria places on
foreign trade and investment,'' it added.
   Bulgaria wants to expand trade with the United States beyond the
current $130 million annual level. The Bulgarians plan to visit Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and New York on a U.S. tour lasting
through May 2.
   Axen and Shultz also were expected to discuss efforts to settle
financial claims estimated at more than $70 million by Americans
whose property on East German territory was taken during and after
World War II.
   The U.S. and East German officials said they doubted there would
be serious talk about a visit to the United States by East German
leader Erich Honecker, as was reported in a West German magazine.
Honecker is known to be interested in such a visit ``but it isn't
ripe for discussion,'' the U.S. official said.

   An Italian professor was questioned by
police after 250 artifacts from as early as Egypt's Pharaonic
period were found in his apartment, a police source said.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on
Wednesday that police searched the apartment in Cairo's fashionable
Zamalek suburb on a tip that the Italian was dealing in stolen
artifacts.
   In addition to the Pharaonic relics, searchers found artifacts
from the Greco-Roman, Coptic and Islamic periods of Egyptian
history.
   Italian Embassy spokesman Vincenzo Grassi identified the man a
professor at an Italian government-run technical school in Cairo.
Grassi said although an investigation was under way, the professor
had not been charged in the case.

   Clint Eastwood has laid down his gavel for

Carmel _ an event that made the day of some of his neighbors.
   ``It's kind of nice to have it all over with. We all enjoyed it,
but the carnival's over now,'' said Clayton Anderson, one of six
candidates vying to succeed the movie star.
   Eastwood's ride into the political sunset will end the frequent

hero of ``Dirty Harry,'' ``Magnum Force'' and countless westerns
says he has no regrets.
   ``I wouldn't trade the last two years for anything,'' Eastwood
said at Tuesday night's meeting. ``I have always felt if we took
our work seriously but didn't take ourselves seriously, we'd be a
much happier community. I'll be out there sitting with you next

   Eastwood wished good luck to the mayoral candidates running in
next week's election. His term expires in May, and he announced
earlier this year that he wouldn't seek a second term.

   Author Jerzy Kosinski is back in his

of his novel ``The Painted Bird,'' which once caused him to be
reviled as a traitor there.
   The 55-year-old author, who grew up in the industrial city of

   Kosinski, head of the U.S. Fund for Polish-Jewish Research, said

Polish past for Jewish spiritual development.''
   As a Pole, he said, he wants to acknowledge ``the contribution

   ``The Painted Bird'' was originally banned in Poland because it
depicted the cruelty and brutality of Polish peasants to a fugitive
boy during World War II.

   Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka is
taking his steak-and-chops fare on the road after signing a
tentative agreement to transform a bowling alley into a copy of his
popular restaurant-nightclub.
   Merri-Bowl owners William and Mary Biernat said they have
decided to retire from the 20,000-square-foot business they founded
27 years ago in this Chicago suburb.
   The Biernats recently signed a tentative contract with Ditka and
a group of investors to sell the 24-lane bowling alley, host to
about 1,000 bowlers in various leagues.
   If zoning changes are approved, the proposed $1.5 million
conversion to a restaurant-nightclub like Ditka's Chicago
establishment probably would take until October to complete, said
Edward A. Kirk, a Merrillville businessman who is one of the
investors.
   ``At this point, everything is in motion to go ahead,'' Kirk
said. The restaurant would feature the same menu as Ditka's _
steaks and pork chops _ but with lower prices.

   Judith Richards Hope is the likely nominee to
replace defeated Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork on a federal
appeals court here, a Justice Department official says, but the
daughter-in-law of comedian Bob Hope won't comment on the
possibility.
   President Reagan's nomination of Ms. Hope as a judge of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is ``on
course,'' the official, who asked to remain anonymous, said
Wednesday.
   The FBI and the American Bar Association have been conducting
background investigations of Ms. Hope, a lawyer in private practice
here.
   Bork resigned from the bench in February, four months after his
nomination to the Supreme Court was defeated by the Senate in a
bitter fight.
   Ms. Hope reportedly turned down the judgeship originally but
changed her mind after a call from Reagan. She declined to comment
on her possible nomination.
   Ms. Hope, 47, was national co-chairwoman of Lawyers for
Reagan-Bush in 1984 and was general counsel to the presidential
campaign of Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   She is a partner in the Washington office of Paul, Hastings,
Janofsky & Walker, which has its headquarters in Los Angeles. She
is married to Hope's son, Tony Hope, also a lawyer here.
   The opening on the appeals court here is potentially a crucial
one for the Reagan admnistration. The 11 judges on the court are
sharply divided ideologically, with six generally regarded as
conservatives and five as liberals.
   The court is considered among the most important federal appeals
courts because it handles disputes over governmental regulations
and programs.
   Judges are appointed for life. The current annual salary is
$95,000.

<HEAD>Magazine Wants Board To Reconsider Philadelphia Inquirer Pulitzer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Washington magazine is asking the Pulitzer
Prize Board to reconsider an award to The Philadelphia Inquirer,
saying the newspaper's prize-winning entry replicated earlier work
by others including one of the magazine's reporters.
   Inquirer editors Wednesday denied the accusation by the National
Journal that reporter Tim Weiner used an earlier article by Journal
reporter David C. Morrison as a ``blueprint'' for his series on a
secret Pentagon budget. Weiner's series won a Pulitzer for national
writing.
   Jim Naughton, Inquirer deputy managing editor, said, ``I think
it's a cheap publicity stunt to call attention to the magazine.''
   Richard Frank, National Journal editor, wrote Wednesday to the
Pulitzer board, saying: ``We make no accusation of plagiarism, but
by no account does the Philadelphia Inquirer series deserve a
Pulitzer because Weiner's reporting on the size and composition of
the black budget plows no new journalistic ground.''
   The weekly Journal, owned by Times-Mirror, does in-depth
reporting on government and has a circulation of 5,000, mostly
among government officials and journalists. An annual subscription
costs $584.
   Frank, in an interview, said he did not complain about the
Weiner articles when they first appeared because his publication is
used to having its work lead to reporting by others, but usually
with some credit given.
   The Inquirer articles, published in February 1987, do not
mention the National Journal's report nearly a year earlier.
   ``They could have avoided this if they had given some credit,''
said Frank, ``but then they would not have won the Pulitzer.''
   Weiner, who shared a 1982 Pulitzer for reporting for the Kansas
City Times, said he wrote a sidebar to his articles citing Morrison
and describing how he analyzed the secret budget, ``but it was
spiked because it was deemed too boring.''
   Weiner said he does not write to win prizes and feared
journalism would be hurt by what he said are false allegations.
   Robert Christopher, Pulitzer board secretary, said he had been
informed of the complaint but had not yet read the letter
requesting board action. ``Clearly any allegation of this kind, any
complaint of this kind would be considered,'' said Christopher.
   Frank wrote that Weiner's story ``can only be read as a blatant
and egregious case of building a news story according to someone
else's blueprint: in this case, the National Journal's March 1,
1986, cover story, `The Pentagon's Black Budget.'''
   Frank told the board that several other news organizations also
had earlier written about the money used to underwrite secret
defense research and unpublicized aspects of the arms buildup.
   He enclosed copies of the Journal and Inquirer stories, along
with a Washington Post article on preparations for World War IV,
which he said Weiner ``substantially replicates'' in one of his
reports.
   The letter cites quotations from Morrison's story that are
nearly identical to those in Weiner's article and says in several
places Weiner's phrasing and detail echo those in Morrison's
article.
   However, Frank said he was not accusing Weiner of lifting quotes
_ he said at least one official acknowledged saying exactly the
same thing to both reporters.
   ``Most of Weiner's sources are pretty much the ones that
Morrison had used a year earlier,'' Frank wrote.
   ``We are confident that the board, armed with these facts, will
reconsider its awarding of the prize to the Weiner series,'' the
letter said.
   Frank said Morrison in 1985 became the first to use Pentagon
documents to determine the size of the ``black budget.'' At the
time Morrison was a senior research analyst at the Center for
Defense Information, an independent think tank. He later joined the
Journal.
   Morrison, interviewed at the Journal office, said he thought
Weiner did ``an amazingly poor job in developing the story,
considering the amount of time he had.'' He said the Pulitzer board
should make awards for ground-breaking stories, adding, ``I'm sorry
they failed to do this.''
   Inquirer Managing Editor Gene Foreman called the Journal protest
an ``unfair attack on Tim's reporting.'' He said both stories quote
some of the same sources because there are few sources available on
the matter.
   ``The Journal did not inspire our story. We did not replicate
but went well beyond what it reported,'' Foreman said.
   Weiner said he interviewed more than 100 people around the
country and was ``knee-deep in this before I saw David's work.''
   ``I think David Morrison is a terrific reporter, and he did fine
work on this subject. But he's making a false accusations, and it's
a false controversy that's going to ultimately hurt journalism,''
he said.
   ``I don't write stories to win prizes, and I wrote these to
bring an important public policy issue to people's attention,'' he
said.
   Jonathan Neumann, Inquirer editor for investigative projects,
said the Inquirer laid the groundwork for the ``black budget''
story even before Weiner became involved and long before the
Morrison article was written.

<HEAD>Analysis of Single Hair Helps Identify Owner; May Help Solve
Crimes</HEAD>

   A technique for analyzing extremely small bits
of genetic material shows promise for helping identify criminals
from a single hair left at a crime scene, researchers reported
today.
   The technique revealed which variant of a particular gene each
of six people had, by analysis of a single hair each person had
shed, the scientists wrote in the British journal Nature.
   John Hicks, deputy assistant director of the FBI laboratory in
Washington, D.C., called the work ``very exciting.''
   The technique cannot yet prove that a hair came from a
particular person, but in combination with other evidence its
result can be seen as ``very, very significant,'' he said.
   Further refinements may let it make identifications with more
certainty,
   The work was conducted by Russell Higuchi and Henry Erlich of
the Cetus Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., and George Sensabaugh and
Cecilia von Beroldingen of the University of California, Berkeley.
   It focuses on DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, which forms tiny
thread-like structures called chromosomes in every cell of the
body. DNA consists of sequences of chemicals. Some sequences form
genes, which control the activities of a cell.
   Details of DNA sequences vary from person to person, and
researchers have exploited that fact to help solve crimes by
studying such ``DNA fingerprints.''
   In February, for example, a Florida jury convicted a 24-year-old
man of rape after testimony that his DNA matched that found in
semen left by the rapist.
   Hair that has been ripped from the body, as in a struggle, often
contains enough living tissue in its root area for conventional DNA
analysis.
   But more often, police recover hair that has simply fallen off a
person at the crime scene, and that hair contains far less DNA,
experts say.
   The California researchers overcame that problem by using a
laboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction that created
100 billion copies of a particular portion of DNA.
   The ability to analyze a single hair is important, said Hicks,
because that is typically all that is available at crime scenes. In
addition, multiple hairs from a crime scene may have come from
different people, said forensic hair expert Skip Palenik at McCrone
Associates in Chicago.
   At present, a shed hair is examined microscopically for its
physical appearance, Palenik said. But because different people can
have similar-looking hairs, the new DNA technique ``represents a
very important first step'' toward firm identification of people
from a shed hair, he said.
   In the study, the researchers reported using a test to determine
which of 21 versions of the ``DQ alpha'' gene is present in an
individual. The gene plays a role in the disease-fighting immune
system.
   In tests of six people, the researchers reported, a single shed
hair correctly indicated which version of the gene each person had.
   More recent tests show success rates of 40 to 70 percent,
Higuchi said in a telephone interview, adding that researchers plan
to try an improved testing procedure.
   He said the next step is testing for more genetic
characteristics, to allow greater certainty in linking a hair to a
particular person. If the hair and a person share characteristics
that fewer than one in 1,000 people possess, that would greatly
help in making the link in court, he said.
   Standard DNA fingerprint techniques offer more definitive
matches, with the chance of two people sharing the same DNA
characteristics described as one in several billion.
   Hicks said that with further development, the new technique
could well ``approach the fingerprint-type identifying capability.
That's what we'd be looking for down the road.''

   A woman who dropped out of the 1988 Miss USA
pageant after being charged with shoplifting pleaded guilty
Wednesday.
   During her appearance in Hennepin County District Court, former
Miss Minnesota-USA Sue Bolich, 24, of Mound admitted stealing
several items from the Dayton's store at the Southdale shopping
mall.
   She was arrested Jan. 22. Police said she had taken $370 worth
of items, including a swimsuit, silk scarves and hairpieces.
   In exchange for her guilty plea, she will be placed in a program
while she receives counseling.
   ``It's fair for a first-time alleged offender like Susie, and I
think things will turn out fine for her,'' said Bolich's attorney,
Peter Timmons.
   Bolich's successor to the Miss Minnesota-USA title also withdrew
before the Miss USA pageant, after it was reported that she had
pleaded guilty to shoplifting in 1986.

   University of Kentucky students marched
Wednesday to protest a racial slur made the previous day by former
Gov. A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler, who helped the first black players
get into major league baseball.
   About 40 students marched across campus to meet with university
President David Roselle to call for an apology by Chandler or his
resignation from the school's board of trustees. Some marchers
expressed anger with placards such as ``Hopefully Happy is Sad,''
while others demanded an explanation, shouting ``We want to know!''
   Chandler, a two-time governor of Kentucky and former U.S.
senator, reacted by saying, ``They're trying to make a mountain out
of a molehill.'' He said he had no plans to apologize unless asked
to do so by Roselle or Gov. Wallace Wilkinson.
   But in an interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader, he said:
``If it is offensive, I'm ready to say I'm just really sad and
sorry. In other words, my head is bloody but unbowed.''
   During a committee's discussion Tuesday of the university's 1985
decision to sell off its investments in South Africa, Chandler
said, ``You know Zimbabwe's all nigger now. There aren't any
whites.''
   ``I don't think I should be censured for this,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home in Versailles, Ky. ``I don't
think I deserve any harsh treatment.''
   Chandler, 89, was commissioner of baseball from 1945-51 and
takes credit for opening the door for Jackie Robinson to become the
first black to play major-league baseball when Robinson signed with
the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.
   Wilkinson, who appointed Chandler to a voting position on the
university governing board earlier this year, said Wednesday that
he believed Chandler meant nothing derogatory but should apologize
anyway.
   ``It was a bad statement and it was a statement that should
never be made,'' Wilkinson said, ``and I'm going to recommend to
him that he apologize and explain it.''
   In the telephone interview, Chandler said that while growing up
in Corydon in Henderson County ``there were 400 whites and 400
blacks. We called them niggers and they didn't mind. We loved each
other. We never had any trouble.
   ``I integrated schools when other governors were sending troops
in to keep blacks out. I was sending troops in to keep them in.''
He was governor in 1935-39, and again in 1955-59.
   Roselle told the students that the ``university completely and
totally repudiates what it is Governor Chandler says.'' But he said
he didn't known yet whether there would be any action against
Chandler.
   Roselle said he hopes some good comes from the incident such as
the need for ``a continuing, aggressive program of action to put
aside all semblances of racial prejudice at this University of
Kentucky.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis'
effort to widen his delegate lead in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination took him briefly out of New York and into
Pennsylvania, where he visited his alma mater.
   The visit to Pennsylvania was one of dozens expected from
candidates in the three weeks before the state's April 26 primary,
when 178 Democratic delegates are at stake.
   ``We're going to pick up probably half of their time while
they're in New York'' campaigning for 225 delegates at stake there
April 19, said Larry Yatch, state Democratic Party chairman.
   Dukakis, holding a slight edge over Jesse Jackson after winning
the Wisconsin primary Tuesday, spent the first part of the
following day in New York. There he promised to be a president who
wars on drugs and homelessness at home and supports Israel abroad.
   In Pennsylvania, he visited Swarthmore College, where he
received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1955.
   Dukakis said he was optimistic about his chances in the
Pennsylvania primary and he expects to win his share of the state's
large black and ethnic populations, despite the presence of Jackson.
   ``Both of us care about people,'' he said. ``We care about
important human values.''
   Dukakis said he had sought Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey's
endorsement, as he has Gov. Mario Cuomo's in New York, ``but, as in
the case of Governor Cuomo, that's a decision that only he can
make, and I respect whatever decision he does make.''
   Casey has said he will not make an endorsement.
   During his visit to Swarthmore, a 1,300-student liberal arts
college, he was reintroduced to old classmates and professors and
given such mementos as a college baseball cap and a physics book.
   Dukakis also met with local Democratic officials and his
southeastern Pennsylvania finance committee.

<TEXT>
   The bitter Baby M custody fight ended with
surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould winning unsupervised
visitation rights she says will allow ``a meaningful and
substantial relationship'' with her daughter.
   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween on Wednesday urged both
sides in the dispute to protect 2-year-old Melissa Stern, known to
the world as Baby M, by resolving their differences and keeping the
child out of the public eye.
   ``The court does not underestimate the great difficulty the
parties will have in accepting others' roles in Melissa's life,''
Sween said in the ruling granting gradually expanded, unsupervised
visitation to Mrs. Whitehead-Gould.
   ``However, family tragedies in our society are not uncommon and
parents often are called upon to make sacrifices arising from
unforseen circumstances,'' Sween said.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Melissa's father, William Stern, and
his wife, Elizabeth, won't appeal Sween's ruling, bringing an end
to a highly publicized dispute that sparked worldwide debate on
reproduction technologies.
   Sween also barred both sides from discussing publicly their
relationships with Melissa, but allowed them to talk about their
experiences in general. This clears the way for publication of Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's book. It has no effect on films or books written
without the involvement of the people in the case.
   Sween rejected the Sterns' contention during a three-day hearing
last week that Melissa would suffer psychologically by seeing Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould and that the child had developed no emotional
attachment to her mother.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who is 31 today, will have one six-hour
visit a week, under the ruling. Sween said the schedule will be
expanded during the next year to include overnight stays, holidays
and two weeks in the summer of 1989.
   ``I am delighted and grateful to know that as Melissa grows up
we will have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each
other,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said in a statement released by her
lawyers.
   ``I have struggled in order to preserve our relationship,'' she
said. ``That relationship has been preserved; in fact, it will be
strenghthened and advanced.''
   The Sterns, who have custody of Melissa and are both 42 years
old, wanted Sween to delay for at least six years visits between
Melissa and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who had been seeing the child for
two hours once a week under supervision.
   They were disappointed with the ruling on visitation, but
pleased with the judge's decision on publicity, said Frank Donahue,
one of the Tenafly couple's attorneys.
   ``They wanted to put an end to the litigation and the publicity
and protect Melissa,'' Donahue said.
   The judge, in a written decision filed in Hackensack and made
public here, said both sides must come to terms with their new
relationship.
   The judge said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould must remember she is not the
primary caretaker for the child she named Sara but now calls
Melissa. He said the Sterns will make parental decisions in such
areas as religion and education.
   ``Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould must accept and understand that
Melissa is not Sara and that her father and stepmother will be her
parental role models and provide the day-to-day, parent-child
interaction,'' Sween said.
   ``William and Elizabeth Stern must accept and understand that
Melissa will develop a different and special relationship with her
mother, stepfather, siblings and extended family, and that these
relationships need not dminish their parent-child relationship with
Melissa,'' Sween said.
   The tug-of-war began after Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, then married to
Richard Whitehead, agreed to be artificially inseminated with
Stern's sperm.
   She gave birth to Melissa on March 31, 1986, but decided to
refuse the $10,000 surrogate fee and keep the baby.
   That led to a landmark New Jersey Supreme Court ruling, which
outlawed surrogacy-for-pay, restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights, upheld custody for the Sterns and ordered the
lower court hearing on visitation rights.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has since divorced Whitehead and married
Dean Gould. The couple, from East Brunswick, is expecting a child
soon.
   In a related development, a Florida Senate committee Wednesday
approved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to bear
a child.

<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old man married a woman he had
never seen outside of jail or the courtroom five minutes before he
was sentenced to 27-years-to-life in prison for murder.
   Joseph Mastropietro and his 30-year-old bride, Antoinette Natale
exchanged vows in a state Supreme Court judge's chambers shortly
after his sentencing judge refused to perform the ceremony, said
defense attorney Gaspar Castillo Jr.
   Mastropietro, of Troy, was convicted for his role in the 1987
stabbing death of 81-year-old Irene Farrell in the Albany suburb of
Watervliet. A companion, Lloyd Cummings, received an
18-years-to-life sentence.
   Mastropietro was introduced to Natale, an Albany hairdresser,
during a jailhouse visit shortly after he was arrested in March
1987, Castillo said.
   The pair corresponded frequently and Natale visited Mastropietro
in jail, the attorney said. She faithfully attended her future
husband's murder trial. A few days before the sentencing,
Mastropietro told his lawyer he wanted to get married.
   ``I attempted to discourage them because they really didn't have
an opportunity to formulate a relationship,'' Castillo said. ``They
insisted that they wanted to get married.''
   Natale, dressed in a plain white dress for her wedding, said she
didn't want people thinking she's foolish for marrying
Mastropietro. ``I love him and I believe he's innocent,'' she said
before ducking away from reporters.
   Castillo said Albany County Court Judge Joseph Harris refused to
marry the couple, but delayed sentencing to give the lawyer a
chance to find a judge who would perform the ceremony. Supreme
Court Judge Edward Conway agreed.
   Mastoprietro couldn't have been married after the sentencing
because under state law, prisoners serving life sentences cannot
get a marriage license, Castillo said.
   During the ceremony, Natale gave a ring to Mastropietro, who
couldn't reciprocate.
   The lawyer said he wasn't sure when the couple will have the
chance to be alone together. Only some New York prisons allow
conjugal visits, but there's a long waiting list for the privilege,
he said.
   ``I spoke to this woman at length and she's committed to this
young man,'' Castillo said. ``I'm not sure if it's love or the kind
of human concern that develops for another person that doesn't have
anything to do with romantic love.''
   Castillo said he's appealing Mastroprietro's conviction.
   Mastroprietro was given the maximum sentence.
   Harris rejected Castillo's bid for leniency in sentencing
Mastropietro, saying ``what happened here transcended the normal
bounds of society.''
   Farrell was found stabbed in her home on March 8, 1987.
Mastroprietro and Cummings had gone there with the intent of
stealing her car. The woman's hands were tied and she was stabbed
three times in her side. Doctors said she lingered for several
hours before dying.

   The Police Department launched a new
enforcement sweep Wednesday night against gang members whose
violent behavior has shocked the nation's second-largest city in
recent weeks.
   About 260 officers joined in Wednesday night's sweep. The task
force concentrated on gang ``hot spots'' in four police
jurisdictions, said police Lt. John O'Connell.
   ``There's been scattered reports of shots fired,'' O'Connell
said, indicating accounts of police hearing gunfire. ``But as of
right now we haven't had any shootings.''
   Officers set up a mobile booking unit in the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum where they were processing dozens of people
arrested for a variety of suspected offenses, including parole
violation and weapons possession.
   A department bus was taking those arrested to jail.
   Last year, more than 400 people died from gang violence.
District Attorney Ira Reiner said if current trends hold, that
number will be topped this year.
   On Tuesday, a city finance committee approved an additional $2.5
million for police to use in fighting the city's unrelenting gang
violence.
   The added $2.5 million was expected to win final approval from
the City Council on Friday. It would pay for 1,000 extra officers
to be deployed in gang-infested areas and would cover police
overtime costs in fighting gang violence.
   Shootings like one Friday that killed one person and injured a
dozen others have created an emergency situation, city officials
say.

   The lordship of Stratford-upon-Avon, the

the highest price ever paid for an ancient title.
   The lordship entitles the new owner to describe himself as
``Lord of the Manor of Stratford-upon-Avon'' on his stationery and
passport.
   It carries no right to houses, lands or a seat in the House of
Lords and won't give the owner a foothold in the British
aristocracy.
   Apart from the title, the prize is a collection of ancient
manorial documents, some dating back more than 1,200 years.
   An agent said he bought the title on Wednesday for an

   A drug ring openly run by a small-town
fire chief, police chief and their families was protected by a web
of bribes that has implicated two county sheriffs and
commissioners, according to court documents.
   The latest to agree to a plea bargain in the case involving the
town of Kermit was Mingo County Sheriff Charles E. ``Eddie''
Hilbert, who is trying to avoid trial on 13 felony counts alleging
that he bought his job for $100,000 and then protected the ring,
court documents say.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph F. Savage called Hilbert's
alleged activities ``the most appalling abuse of public office
since Napoleon gave away the monarchies in Europe to his
relatives.''
   The joint federal-state probe began two years ago when
investigators discovered drugs being sold so freely in Kermit, a
town of 700 in Mingo County, that undercover officers were able to
photograph a ``No Drugs Today'' sign posted outside a trailer.
   So far, the investigation of the ring, which sold cocaine, PCP
and other drugs, has netted more than 50 convictions or guilty
pleas, with no acquittals.
   Among those serving sentences of up to 16 years for operating
the ring are former Kermit Fire Chief Wilburn Preece; his wife,
Virginia; their son-in-law, former Police Chief David Ramey; and
their four sons and two of their daughters. A third daughter was
placed on probation.
   Hilbert will be sentenced in federal court on April 18, the same
day as Johnie Owens, a one-time Mingo County Democratic chairman
and sheriff accused of selling his sheriff's job to Hilbert. Owens
faces up to 14 years in prison and $700,000 in fines.
   An court order filed Tuesday provided no further information on
Hilbert's proposed plea agreement. Hilbert would face a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment without parole if convicted of all 13
counts.
   In an interview this week, Owens denied knowing about the Preece
drug operation when he sold his job, but said ``it's going to be a
better Mingo'' because of the investigation.
   ``If nothing else, it's made people realize that it was wrong.
Even if they knew it was wrong, they didn't know the extent it was
wrong,'' he said.
   Hilbert, who is free on $100,000 bail and continues to serve as
sheriff, could not be reached at his office Wednesday night, and
his home number was unlisted.
   Owens said he accepted a $20,000 downpayment on the $100,000
bribe from Hilbert, then persuaded the three county commissioners
to accept his resignation and appoint Hilbert in exchange for half
of the bribe.
   Former Commissioner Rastie Runyon Jr. has pleaded guilty to
federal income tax evasion charges related to the bribe and awaits
sentencing later this month. Commissioner Steve Adkins, the only
member of the 1982 panel still in office, was indicted Jan. 15 on
one count of bribery. He has denied the charge but is not running
for re-election.
   The third commissioner, state Sen. H. Truman Chafin, has not
been charged in federal or state court. He has adamantly denied any
knowledge of the sale of the sheriff's office.
   Also caught by the investigation was county political boss Larry
Hamrick, who pleaded guilty to three felony charges of protecting
the Preece drug ring, using public funds for political campaigns
and intimidating a witness.
   The indictment against Hilbert accuses him of two counts of
racketeering in connection with buying both his office and a spot
on a powerful county political slate from Owens. He also faces two
counts of aiding and abetting the Preece family drug operation ``by
seeing to it the law wasn't enforced'' in return for illegal
campaign contributions.

   Here are excerpts of the ruling by Superior
Court Judge Birger M. Sween, who granted unsupervised visitation to
surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould on Wednesday was immediately granted one
six-hour day of visitation with the 2-year-old child, Melissa
Stern, with the schedule expanded over the next year to include
overnights, holidays and a two-week vacation in the summer of 1989.

periods under restrictive and confining circumstances.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that
Melissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by
continued and expanded visitation with her mother.
   William and Elizabeth Stern offered no evidence to support their
fears that Melissa's continued relationship with her mother will
somehow adversely affect her development or jeopardize their

   The court does not underestimate the great difficulty the

Family dreams have been shattered, insults and false accusations

uncommon and parents often are called upon to make sacrifices
arising from unforeseen circumstances. In the context of family
problems frequently seen by Family Court judges, the causes of the
parties' estrangement do not appear insurmountable.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The parties do not have the emotional scars of a failure of an

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson gave a spirited defense of his
credentials as he pleaded with supporters to provide him the funds
to finish the last stage of the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   ``The only hope for the campaign's success is to believe in it
enough to invest in it,'' Jackson said Wednesday at a fund-raiser
at an Indianapolis nightclub, which approximately 650 people paid
$20 apiece to attend.
   Jackson is a close second to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
in the number of delegates won. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore is a
distant third.
   Jackson said his campaign's ability to survive financially
through delegate-selection procedures in 40 states shows his
management skill.
   That skill plus his ability to set a moral tone for the nation
and to voice the concerns of the averae American make him qualified
to be president, Jackson contended.
   ``Some officeholders are not leaders, and some leaders are not
officeholders,'' Jackson said. ``If tomorrow morning, you were
about to lose your job, among those who are running, Republican or
Democrat, who would you want to argue your case?''
   In a 30-minute speech, Jackson said that although he hasn't held
public office, he has experience negotiating in labor disputes, the
Middle East and in farm crises.
   Holding office shouldn't be a criterion for running for
president, he said.
   ``Most Cabinet members who run the government on a day-to-day
basis haven't held a government office,'' said Jackson. ``You want
somebody to argue your case, here am I.''
   At his first stop in Indianapolis on Wednesday, Jackson
predicted that his campaign stands against drugs and for farmers
will inspire a wide range of people to vote for him in Indiana's
May 3 Democratic presidential primary.
   Jackson declined to say that he will win the primary and the
largest share of Indiana's 79 delegates, but he said his
involvement should stir voter interest and increase participation.
   The 2{-hour event was also beamed by satellite to seven other
locations in Indiana and sites in eight other states.

<TEXT>
   The Arab hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner
today released 32 more hostages in Iran and told negotiators those
remaining aboard will be in serious danger if their demands are not
met.
   The hijackers singled out three members of the Kuwaiti royal
family, two of them women, who they said will be among the first
passengers ``to pay a dear price,'' according to Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency, or IRNA.
   The hijackers, armed with grenades and pistols, are demanding
the release of 17 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists imprisoned
in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in that Persian
Gulf state in 1983.
   Kuwait rejected the demand, calling it ``blackmail,'' but also
sent a government delegation to Mashhad airport in northeastern
Tehran to negotiate.
   Fifty-seven passengers and crew members have been freed by the
Arabic-speaking hijackers since they forced the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 747 to land at Mashhad airport on Tuesday.
   That left roughly 50 hostages aboard the jumbo jet, which was
comandeered en route to Kuwait from Bangkok. All the remaining
hostages were believed to be Arabs, including at least 30 Kuwaitis,
and all but two of them men.
   The nationality of the hijackers was not known. Hostages who
have been freed said there are five or six hijackers, all wearing
masks.
   In a statement, the hijackers today said they considered those
remaining aboard political prisoners they will use to ``settle our
account'' with the Kuwaiti government, said IRNA, which is
monitored in Nicosia.
   As soon as the 32 left the plane at 2:30 a.m. today (7 p.m. EDT
Wednesday) the hijackers slammed the doors shut and switched off
the lights in the cabin, warning Iranian security forces not to
approach the aircraft, the agency said.
   IRNA said the 32 hostages released today included 12 Britons,
six Thais, three Pakistanis, two Austrians, two Syrians, one
Japanese, one Irish, one German, one Lebanese, one Sudanese, one
South Korean and one from South Yemen.
   Twenty-four female hostages were released on Wednesday and a
Jordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on Tuesday.
   In a statement issued shortly before today's release, the
hijackers said they they wanted the world to know the Kuwait
government severely tortures Moslem prisoners, IRNA reported.
   The statement said the world must realize ``the real nature of
the Kuwaiti rulers who have overlooked all the problems of the
Moslem world, at the top of them the issue of Palestine and the
brave Palestinians who are fighting Israel.'' The hijackers
stressed they would not back down from their demand, ``even if the
price is too high.''
   The members of the Kuwait royal family aboard have been
identified as Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, a businessman, and his two
sisters, Ebtesam and Anware.
   Tehran radio said Anware on Wednesday relayed a message to the
Mashhad control tower through a doctor asking the Kuwaiti
delegation at the airport to negotiate with the hijackers, to ask
Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family to accept the hijackers' demands.
   Tehran radio said Anware ``whose voice was shaking, was
overtaken by strong physical tension and panic.''
   The hijackers had contacted the control tower earlier Wednesday,
asking for a doctor to be sent to the plane. After receiving
treatment from the doctor, Anware passed her message to the tower,
adding that she and her sister were ``feeling alright,'' the radio
added.
   Food was also brought earlier Wednesday to those still aboard
the jet.
   Release of the 17 jailed Shiites has been a recurring demand of
Shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   Many acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on Shiite
Moslems acting for Iran, which has been at war with Iraq since
September 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding Iraq.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis, wooing New York state's
255 Democratic convention votes, is promising to be a president who
wars on drugs and homelessness at home and supports Israel abroad.
   Dukakis issued a list of more than 200 prominent New York
Democrats supporting his candidacy and formally named Reps. Gary
Ackerman of Queens and Louise Slaughter of Rochester as his
chairmen in the campaign for the April 19 primary at a rally in a
senior citizen center in part of the city's biggest Greek-American

   Among the four cochairman of the Dukakis state campaign was
Michael Del Guidice, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's former chief of staff.
   Cuomo has not endorsed any of the Democratic hopefuls and the
state's other top elected Democrat, Mayor Edward I. Koch, says he
wants Cuomo for president.
   The other state cochairmen for Dukakis are former New York City

   The wife of Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
says her husband shouldn't be counted out of the Democratic
presidential race or chastised for criticizing the other contenders
for the nomination.
   His message is that he is the only Democratic candidate with
experience in both the federal government and foreign policy, Mrs.
Gore said Wednesday during a series of stops in Indiana to help
kick off her husband's campaign for the May 3 Hoosier primary in
which 79 delegates are at stake.
   ``I think it's a three-man race,'' she said during a stop at a
Salvation Army center in Indianapolis. ``I think we did very well
in Wisconsin considering we got a late start there.''
   Gore polled 17 percent of the votes in Wisconsin to finish third
behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   Gore was criticized by Jackson supporters after he said recently
that Americans are choosing a president, not a preacher, and should
look at candidates' experience in public service.
   ``He's just drawing the differences between his leadership and

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relief may be in sight for frustrated
motorists trapped on California's gridlocked highways _ in sight,
that is, on a 4-inch dashboard video screen.
   As part of a pilot traffic management program unveiled Wednesday
by the state Department of Transportation, little black boxes will
alert drivers to road congestion and traffic accidents on
electronic road maps displayed on the dash.
   The sophisticated devices, which transportation officials used
last year to help monitor traffic during Pope John Paul II's visit
to Los Angeles, will then help motorists snake their way around
traffic problems by flashing alternate routes on the screen.
   ``This system will help the user avoid problems rather than
driving into and becoming part of the problem itself,'' Department
Director Robert K. Best said at a news conference announcing the
project.
   The $1.6 million test of the system will begin this summer in
Los Angeles. During the study, which is a joint project involving
the department, the Federal Highway Administration and General
Motors, drivers hired by the state will cruise the congested Santa
Monica Freeway in 25 cars equipped with the units.
   On-board computers will relay the location and speed of the cars
to the the state agency's traffic operations office in Los Angeles,
improving the accuracy and timeliness of traffic reports the
department relays to media outlets.
   To operate the device, a driver inserts a cassette containing an
electronic map of an area up to 10 miles from the car and selects a
destination. An arrow on the 4-inch-square screen then traces the
vehicle's progress along roads.
   The state agency currently uses television monitoring and
electronic road sensors placed every quarter-mile along 300 miles
of Los Angeles' most congested freeways to gather road information.
   Los Angeles, notorious for its rush-hour traffic, is the only
area now wired to accommodate the two-way, high-tech navigational
system, which will utilize the sensor monitoring system.
   A similar system for 215 miles of congested freeways in San
Francisco would cost $130 million, officials said.
   The units, which are commercially available for about $2,500
apiece, will cost between $300 and $500 when they are
mass-produced, officials said. But even if the pilot program goes
well, it may be 10 years before the technology is perfected and the
system is available to most drivers.
   In a test run after the news conference, officials were
embarrassed when one of four units failed to work properly.
   ``This one needs to be recalibrated, I guess,'' said driver Don
Juje, of the state agency. ``I guess we pushed too many buttons.''
   Nevertheless, officials heralded the beginning of the project as
an important next step.
   ``If we want to continue to make owning and operating a car a
pleasure instead of a chore, one challenge our industry must take
up _ and quickly _ is improving the commuting experience,'' said
Dr. William G. Angew, director of programs and planning for General
Motors.
   GM is providing the cars and support personnel for the project.
   The state is contributing $900,000, and the federal agency is
providing $750,000 and technical assistance.
   More than half of all congestion is caused by accidents and
incidents that distract drivers' attention, officials said.
   Urban congestion ``can't be solved entirely by more asphalt and
concrete,'' said Robert E. Farris, an official with the federal
agency.

   A government prosecutor late
Wednesday said an arrest warrant has been issued for deposed
President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Prosecutor Alvaro Visuetti said in an interview on Channel 2, a
military- controlled television station, that warrants had been
issued for Delvalle and Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a former ambassador
to the United States.
   He said that a warrant had been issued earlier for the arrest of
Juan B. Sosa, Delvalle's ambassador to the United States.
   The warrants reportedly accuse the three of crimes against the
state, usurping public power and crimes against the economic
security of Panama.
   Delvalle was fired by the National Legislature at the end of
February after he tried to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as head
of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces. Noriega, the power
behind the civilian government, is under indictment in the United
States on drug trafficking charges.
   Delvalle has been in hiding ever since his dismissal. The United
States still considers him Panama's legitimate president, and has
frozen all Panamanian bank funds in the United States.
   Since Delvalle's ousting, the nation has been gripped by a
severe political and economic crisis that shows no signs of abating.
   In other developments Wednesday, police fired tear gas and
birdshot to break up an opposition demonstration in Panama City,
and the United States completed deployment of 1,300 extra troops to
Panama to beef up security for American personnel and property in
the former Panama Canal Zone.
   Also Wednesday, Panama's civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis
Palma, announced the government had agreed to talks with opposition
groups ``without preconditions or irreconcilable demands.''
   The Reagan administration said 800 Marines would start arriving
in Panama on Friday for what it described as three weeks of routine
jungle training.
   Panama's opposition, which has been seeking Noriega's ouster for
more than 10 months, sponsored a ``march against hunger'' Wednesday
afternoon, but police flooded the park where it was to take place
in Panama City.
   Nonetheless, about 50 protesters met at a nearby church and
began a march to the central business district. They had gone
nearly a mile when police stopped them with a barrage of tear gas
and birdshot. Hundreds of people jeered at the police from
sidewalks and balconies despite the swirls of tear gas that
enveloped blocks of Central Avenue, the main shopping thoroughfare.
   Many onlookers threw garbage into the avenue and sidestreets and
set fire to piles of refuse. It took more than an hour for police
to restore order. No injuries were immediately reported.
   A state-owned television station reported that two U.S. soldiers
in an Army jeep were stopped and detained by Panamanian troops near
the protest. Maj. Ann Crum of the U.S. Southern Command said the
soldiers were freed an hour later.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, who spoke on
condition he was not identified, said the two American soldiers
apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident. He said
the Army was investigating the case.
   The march was designed to protest a deteriorating economic
situation that has left thousands of Panamanians penniless.

<HEAD>Parents of 28 Children Get Keys To 15-Bedroom Dream Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bob and Linda Cornyn and 23 of their 28
children pulled up in the family bus and then received the keys to
a 15-bedroom, eight-bathroom dream house remodeled for them with
government help.
   ``This is all very exciting,'' said Cornyn, a 42-year-old chief
warrant officer stationed at nearby Fort Lewis who has been in the
Army for 24 years. ``We're all very ecstatic.''
   The Cornyns adopted 25 of their children, including some who are
South Korean, Colombian, Indian, Amerasian and black and some with
disabilities.
   Some are wheelchair-bound or move about on crutches. They all
help care for each other.
   ``We have a rainbow family,'' said Cornyn. ``We have just about
every color there is. We look at the rainbow as God's promise.''
   The family, except for three children who were in school and two
in a hospital, were at Wednesday's ceremonies.
   ``Perhaps in the future we'll need more bedrooms,'' said Mrs.
Cornyn. ``But this is a dream come true. Somebody believed in us
enough to help us. This is something we thought would never
happen.''
   Excited smiles shone on the faces of the children, who range
from age 8 months to 26 years, as they explored the
5,620-square-foot house.
   It has eight bathrooms, a downstairs family room that takes up
nearly the entire floor and two washing machines, dryers and
dishwashers. A yard big enough for a softball game surrounds the
rambling white house at the end of a tree-lined road in this rural
town 30 miles south of Seattle.
   ``I have two children. Believe me, you've got to be
courageous,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who presented the keys
to the Cornyns. ``It's touching and rewarding to see a family like
this.''
   The house was remodeled at a cost of $60,000 by the Pierce
County Housing Development Association, which was formed last April
24.
   Called Project 30 because the Cornyn family numbers 30, the home
purchase and remodeling job is the first project undertaken by the
association, which is leasing the house to the Cornyns.
   The Cornyns were high school sweethearts in Michigan who married
as soon as Linda graduated. They adopted their first child when the
family was stationed in South Korea in 1979.
   ``I guess we do it because it feels good and it's the right
thing to do,'' Coryn said. ``It just makes us feel good to help
someone else. We enjoy seeing these children grow physically and
mentally.''
   He noted that many of his adopted children would be in
institutions if he and his wife hadn't adopted them.
   Cornyn said some of his adopted children received supplemental
Social Security benefits and the family also receives food from
local food banks and clothes from ``lots of people.''
   The Cornyns are the largest family housed under the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development's housing voucher
program, receiving $700 monthly toward rent and utilities.
   The Cornyns are moving from a six-bedroom home in Puyallup to
their new home, which has been expanded during the past six months
from eight bedrooms.
   ``It seems like we've never had enough room,'' said Cornyn.

<HEAD>EPA Won't Tighten Limits on Exposure To Cancer-Causing Benzene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
intends to reaffirm an air pollution standard for benzene, a known
cause of cancer, but critics say the proposal could subject exposed
people to 10 times the risk the agency normally considers
acceptable.
   A memorandum from EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, made
available Wednesday, said the agency would not propose further
regulations for benzene equipment leaks, which probably subject the
most exposed individual to a one in 1,000 risk of leukemia.
   The memo called on agency officials to draft regulations
essentially reaffirming the agency's decisions in 1984 not to
regulate benzene exposure from the manufacture of ethylbenzene and
styrene, storage of benzene in tanks and the manufacture of maleic
anyhydride; but to impose regulations on coke oven emissions and
equipment leaks in chemical plants and refineries. The leaks
regulations have been adopted; the coke oven regulations are still
only a proposal.
   A leading environmentalist attorney, David Doniger of the
Natural Resources Defense Council, called the EPA move ``an
outrageous decision and a complete betrayal of the public health
objectives of the Clean Air Act,'' saying the new standard will
allow a level of risk 1,000 times what should be permitted.
   But an agency spokesman said that only an estimated two people
are exposed to a risk of greater than one in 10,000 under the EPA
standards.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is retreating from a
stand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from having
their asylum requests heard before an immigration judge.
   Earlier rules proposed last Aug. 28 would have required that all
claims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylum
officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Civil liberties groups say INS is unsympathetic to
asylum-seekers, an accusation the agency denies.
   Under the latest proposed revision, immigration judges _ who
work for the Justice Department, not INS _ would continue to
conduct adversarial proceedings for those asylum-seekers facing
exclusion from the United States or deportation.
   The change ``is an important improvement,'' said Arthur Helton,
a attorney for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   Initial asylum applications will be heard by INS asylum
officers. But those officers will receive training from the Justice
Department.
   The revised rule, published in the Federal Register, will become
final after a 30-day public comment period.

<HEAD>Chinese Crack Down on Hunters of Endangered Pandas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities have arrested 203 people
for illegal hunting of the endangered giant panda and recovered 146
pelts, representing about one in seven of all pandas alive at the
last count, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
   ``These are shocking revelations,'' William Reilly, president of
the fund's U.S. affiliate, said in a statement Wednesday. ``The
situation appears to be worsening for the panda,'' with the march
to extinction more advanced than previously believed and hunting
the greatest threat.
   Reilly said it was the first time China had released such
detailed statistics.
   Forestry Minister Gao Dezhan, in a February report announced
that 26 people have been sentenced to prisons terms ranging from a
year to life in connection with an investigation into poaching and
fur trading in Sichuan Province in western China, where almost all
pandas live.
   China's last public estimates of the panda population were made
in 1976 _ about 1,000 animals.

<HEAD>Recently Freed Prisoner Accused Of Brutal Attacks On Two Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MADISON, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man recently freed from prison
brutally attacked one woman, then assaulted a newspaper
photographer's wife who was left at home with her children when her
husband went to cover the first attack, police said.
   Fenton James Riles, 38, was being held today in lieu of $425,000
bond on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, sexual abuse,
robbery and burglary in the abduction and attack of a convenience
store clerk early Wednesday, police said.
   He also was charged with robbery and burglary in the attack on
Lori Dabner, 26, while her husband, Roy, was out covering the
earlier assault, officials said. Additional charges may be filed,
said Gordon Liles, an assistant Lee County attorney.
   Mrs. Dabner was in serious condition at University Hospitals in
Iowa City. The sexual assault victim, who had been left for dead,
was in critical condition at the Fort Madison Community Hospital.
   The Dabners' 2-year-old son was beaten and required hospital
treatment, Liles said. Their 5-month-old sone was unhurt.
   After the first attack was reported on police radio at about 3
a.m., Dabner went to The (Fort Madison) Daily Democrat office to
contact a reporter about covering the story together.
   At the office, ``he heard on the (police radio) scanner that
there was a domestic assault at 3103 Avenue K _ his home,'' said
Randy Miller, the newspaper's editor. Dabner rushed home to find
police there and his wife injured.
   Police said they were first alerted following the robbery and
abduction at knife point of the convenience store clerk.
   Police said the woman was driven away, but that after a few
blocks her abductor's car ran off the road and became disabled. The
woman was repeatedly sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten, then
left for dead in a vacant house, Liles said.
   Miller said a bloodstained man knocked on the back door of the
Dabner home at about 4:30 a.m. and told Mrs. Dabner he needed to
use the phone because he had been in a bad accident and his wife
was seriously injured.
   Once inside, the man took $20 from Mrs. Dabner and beat her on
the head with a piece of wood before fleeing, Liles said.
   Dabner later said he suspected the man may have been walking by
his home when he saw Dabner driving to the assignment.
   ``It was a coincidence,'' he said. ``We didn't know the guy or
anything.''
   A manhunt led to the arrest of Riles about five hours later,
police said.
   An affidavit filed in North Lee County District Court said that
after his arrest Riles waived his rights to remain silent and to
have an attorney present, and admitted to all the charges but
attempted murder.
   Riles was released from a state prison last November and from a
halfway house in Cedar Rapids recently to complete a sentence for
an earlier conviction for theft and willful injury, Liles said.
   Liles said it was his understanding that Riles had satisfied the
15-year sentence by serving six years, with the remainder of the
time accounted for by such provisions as time off for good behavior.

   An investigator in the state attorney general's

   William West, 39, a state investigator for 14 years, and
Clarence Holder were arrested early Wednesday after selling three
ounces of cocaine to an undercover officer for $2,800, police said.
   West pleaded innocent to one felony count of criminal sale of a
controlled substance, two felony counts of criminal possession of a
controlled substance and other minor charges. Holder was being held
pending arraignment.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams said West was one of 12
investigators on the Brawley case, but was taken off the case
Monday. He joined Abrams' staff in 1987 and has no record of legal
or disciplinary problems, Abrams said.
   Miss Brawley, a 16-year-old black from Wappingers Falls, says
she was abducted, raped and abused by six white men in November.
She has refused to cooperate with authorities investigating the
case.

<HEAD>Arrest Warrant Issued For Delvalle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government issued an arrest
warrant for deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle, saying he will
be charged with crimes against the state and the nation's economic
security.
   In another development, the government offered to hold
church-mediated talks with the political opposition. The offer came
after police fired birdshot to break up an anti-government rally by
50 people on Wednesday. Two U.S. soldiers were briefly detained
near the site of the protest.
   Delvalle has been in hiding since Feb. 26, when he was removed
from office after trying to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as
head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. Noriega is the power
behind the civilian government.
   The United States, which still recognizes Delvalle as president,
responded to his ouster by imposing economic sanctions on Panama in
a bid to drive out Noriega, who was indicted in the United States
on drug trafficking charges.
   The sanctions forced Panama's banks to close and Noriega has not
been able to make the government payroll. Food and cash are in
short supply.
   The government announced Wednesday night that it had issued
arrest warrants for Delvalle and for Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a
businessman and former ambassador to the United States. The
government said a warrant was issued earlier for Juan B. Sosa,
Delvalle's ambassador to Washington who has remained there.
   In another development Wednesday, the United States completed
deployment of 1,300 extra troops to beef up security for American
personnel and property in the canal zone. An additional 800 Marines
are to begin arriving Friday for what the White House called three
weeks of routine jungle training that had been planned before the
campaign to oust Noriega plunged Panama into crisis.
   Panama has called the deployment a prelude to invasion.
   The arrest warrants were announced Wednesday night by government
prosecutor Alvaro Visuetti on military-controlled Channel 2
television.
   He said an investigation had uncovered sufficient evidence to
charge Delvalle with crimes against the state, usurping public
duties and crimes against the nation's economic security.
   Earlier Wednesday, acting President Manuel Solis Palma said the
government had agreed to Roman Catholic Church-mediated talks with
the opposition, which has been trying to oust Noriega since June.
   In a letter to Archbishop Marcos McGrath, Solis Palma said the
meeting should be held ``without preconditions or irreconcilable
demands.'' He said the general had named him to head the government
mediation effort.
   The opposition has said that, before entering such talks, it
wants assurances that Noriega is willing to step down and leave the
country. It had no immediate response to Solis Palma's letter.
   The 1,300 newly arrived U.S. troops joined about 10,000 American
military personnel based at the U.S. Southern Command and 670
others sent in earlier in the crisis. They include members of an
Army aviation battalion from Fort Ord, Calif., and military police
from Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Mead, Md. Also ferried in were 26
helicopters, including seven powerful AH-1 Cobra gunships.
   In ordering the buildup last week, the Pentagon said the new
troops were needed to provide security for U.S. citizens and
installations because of Noriega's ``heavy-handed tactics.''
   A heavy police presence thwarted a planned ``march against
hunger'' in Panama City on Wednesday but about 50 demonstrators
nevertheless began walking to the central business district from a
church.
   They shouted anti-Noriega slogans and waved white handkerchiefs
until police caught up with them and dispersed them, shoppers and
other pedestrians with birdshot and volleys of tear gas.
   Plainclothes police armed with M-16 rifles made several arrests,
but no injuries were immediately reported.
   From three tiers of balconies above, apartment residents hurled
garbage into the street to protest the police action.
   ``This is what they shoot at the people, like we were beasts,''
yelled a middle-aged woman as she held up two empty 12-gauge
shotgun shell casings she picked up on the street. ``We've had it
up to here.''
   ``Panamanians are tired of this,'' she said. ``We want the
gringos to attack _ not tomorrow, today.''
   A state-owned television station said Panamanian troops stopped
and detained two U.S. soldiers they stopped in an Army jeep near
the demonstration.
   Southern Command spokeswoman Maj. Ann Crum said the soldiers
were released an hour later.
   The soldiers apparently got lost and drove into the area by
accident, said an officer at the Southern Command, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic presidential quartet effectively becomes a trio
today as Sen. Paul Simon puts his campaign on hold. Michael Dukakis
and Albert Gore, meanwhile, zeroed in on Mideast issues, seen as a
likely sore spot for Jesse Jackson in the upcoming New York primary.
   Simon, who has lost everywhere except in his home state of
Illinois, scheduled a Capitol Hill news conference to talk about
his campaign future. Aides said he was suspending the campaign, but
stopping short of dropping out.
   The three remaining active Democrats were all campaigning today
in New York, which holds its primary April 19. At stake are 255
delegates, in what will be the biggest state contest to date.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in an interview published today, said
he is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary. And he
warned the Democrats _ singling out Gore _ that negative
campaigning is ``terribly dangerous.''
   On the Republican side, there was plenty of parley: Vice
President George Bush, the nominee in all but name, met Wednesday
with former rival Sen. Bob Dole, who pledged to work to get Bush
elected. And Dole talked with Pat Robertson, who remains in the
Republican race although he concedes he has little chance of being
nominated.
   Simon's decision to suspend campaigning ``reflects the reality
of having lost a great many primaries and caucuses,'' said
spokesman Terry Michael, adding that by remaining in the race he
would give his supporters a voice at the convention.
   Simon's mother, Ruth, said her son would remain an official
candidate, if not an active one. ``He's going to hang in there till
the end,'' she said.
   Simon made his last stand in Wisconsin, where he finished a weak
fourth in Tuesday's primary. The Illinois senator ran second in the
leadoff Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8, in what was to be his best showing
of the campaign outside of his home state.
   After finishing third in New Hampshire a week later, he did not
have enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests on
Super Tuesday, March 8, and was consequently clobbered.
   Many expected him to drop out after that, but Simon, under
pressure from Illinois supporters, stayed in for his home-state
primary, then said his victory there was enough reason to remain in
the race.
   For the other Democrats, the battle of New York began in earnest
on Wednesday. Dukakis was at work courting voters in New York's
large Jewish community, stressing the need for a Mideast peace plan
that would allow Israel to ``live in peace and harmony.''
   Gore reiterated his strong support for Israel as he campaigned
Wednesday in New York City. He said as president, he would create a
Cabinet-level position to focus full-time on Mideast negotiations.
Gore also blasted Dukakis and Jackson for a lack of experience in
international affairs.
   Cuomo decried such infighting, saying his admonition was
directed mainly at Gore.
   ``It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous and
counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the
nominee,'' he said in an interview with The Washington Post.
   Cuomo, seen by some Democrats as a potential draftee in the
event of a deadlocked convention, said he preferred to wait until
after the primary season to make an endorsement.
   ``That's the time for leadership in this process,'' the governor
said.
   Jackson was campaigning in New York today, after spending a day
in Arizona, which holds Democratic caucuses on April 16, and
Indiana, where primary day is May 3. In Indianapolis, Jackson was
asked how he expected to do among New York's Jewish voters.
   ``You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. ``All you
can do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see people
are responding.''
   Many Jews were offended by Jackson's 1984 reference to New York
as ``Hymietown'' _ for which he apologized _ and his association
with Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan, who called Judaism a ``gutter
religion.'' Jackson no longer has ties to Farrakhan, his campaign
says.
   Jackson has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the Jewish
community.
   After three straight wins _ in Connecticut, Colorado and
Wisconsin _ Dukakis was leading in the national delegate race. The
latest AP count put him at 740.55, Jackson at 704.55, uncommitted
at 513.6, Gore at 394.8 and Simon at 170.5
   Even if he is not actively campaigning, Simon could continue to
gain delegates, and keep those he has. That would leave him in
control of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at the
Democratic National Convention.
   Whether he meant it to or not, Simon's decision to technically
remain a candidate helps Dukakis remain the leader in the delegate
race.
   Under party rules, Simon is entitled to 47 at-large delegates
from Illinois, Jackson to 13 and Dukakis none. A Simon withdrawal
would automatically shift his 47 delegates to Jackson's column, and
thus put him ahead in national delegate count.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis widened his margin of victory over Jackson in
Monday's Colorado caucuses. Returns on Tuesday showed Dukakis had
narrowly won. On Wednesday, with 85 percent of the precincts
reporting, Dukakis had widened his lead to 11 percentage points, 45
to 34 percent.

<HEAD>Study Says Aging Baby Boomers May Run Out of Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The aging baby boom generation may run out of
doctors early in the next century as a widely predicted surplus of
physicians turns into a shortage, according to reports released
today.
   The authors of two reports, both published in the New England
Journal of Medicine, contend that a feared doctor glut won't
happen. But at least one of the experts who has forecast an
overabundance of physicians says he is not ready to change his mind.
   Several studies during the past decade have forecast that the
United States will have too many doctors by the year 2000, and
recommend that the nation train fewer of them. But now, with that
date just 12 years away, there are signs that opinion may be
swinging the other way.
   In one of today's reports, Drs. William B. Schwartz of Tufts
Medical School and Frank A. Sloan of Vanderbilt University predict
that at best, there will be just enough doctors by 2000 but a mild
shortage is possible.
   In the other, less detailed paper, Dr. Ernest P. Schloss of the
University of Arizona looks into the early decades of the next
century.
   ``It is entirely possible that for the majority of people who
are alive today, there may be another shortage just when they will
need doctors the most _ after 2011, the year in which the first of
the baby boom generation will turn 65 and enter their retirement
years,'' he concludes.
   In general, the doctors argue that the earlier predictions
overstated the supply of doctors and underestimated the demand for
their services. However, Schwartz said those predictions already
have had an impact.
   ``Many college students are looking on medicine as an
unpromising career, in part because they are being told that there
is going to be a huge physician surplus,'' he said in an interview.
``That is undoubtedly one of the factors that has led to a sharp
reduction in the number of applications to medical school,'' which
have fallen 15 per cent since 1981.
   Schwartz' report projects that 592,000 physicians will be needed
by the turn of the century, and 585,000 will be available.
   Dr. Robert G. Petersdorf, president of the Association of
American Medical Colleges, has been warning of a coming doctor glut
for years. He said Schwartz' study makes assumptions about
physician supply and demand that may be wrong.
   ``I agree with the authors that the presumed projected
oversupply should not act as a deterrent to choosing medicine as a
career,'' Petersdorf said. ``At the same time, I am not prepared to
state that an oversupply does not exist. The support for such an
assertion is based on assumption and not on fact.''
   One of the most widely quoted of the earlier projections was a
report in 1980 of the Department of Health and Human Service's
Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee. It
predicted that in 2000, there will be 144,700 too many physicians.
   However, Schwartz said that and other predictions greatly
overstated the supply of doctors. The biggest mistake was assuming
that all of the nation's doctors will be treating patients.
Instead, Schwartz said that about 93,000 of them will be
administrators, teachers and researchers.
   Another miscalcuation, he said, was failing to take into
consideration the impact of the growing proportion of female
doctors, who, studies show, work about 10 percent fewer hours than
their male counterparts.
   The researchers also did not foresee a movement to require
resident physicians to work shorter hours in large teaching
hospitals.
   Schwartz said the earlier predictions also made a mistake by
assuming that the demand for physicians will remain constant.
Instead, he said, the demand for care has been growing at an annual
rate greater than 1 percent for several decades. The availability
of new kinds of care, such as exotic imaging machines, transplants
and genetic analysis, may speed up the demand for more doctors.
   Other factors that could increase demand, he said, include the
increasing age of the population, wider medical insurance coverage
and the AIDS epidemic.

   Discovery, scheduled to make the
first post-Challenger space shuttle flight, is beset by persistent
technical problems which could delay its scheduled Aug. 4 liftoff.
   In recent weeks, there have been troubles with fuel and oxidizer
pumps, engine controllers and booster rocket insulation.
   ``We've always said Aug. 4 is the target, and like most targets,
it's the bull's eye,'' said Thomas Utsman, deputy director of the
Kennedy Space Center. But the technical troubles ``certainly are
going to make that target a small bull's eye.''
   ``I still think from where we are today, an August launch is
achievable,'' he said.
   The problems have forced NASA to delay the rollout of the
shuttle to the launch pad by a week, from May 24 to June 1. Also
delayed a week, until June 22, is a 20-second firing of Discovery's
three main engines with the vehicle locked onto the pad.
   Hugh Harris, a NASA spokesman, said there are several days of
contingency time built into the launch preparation after June 22,
and ``although there are problems, we haven't given up on early
August.''
   A decision on whether to postpone could be made April 14 when
senior NASA managers meet at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
However, officials said a launch date assessment might not be made
until after technicians finish assembling the two soild fuel
booster rockets in late May.
   The newest problem cropped up Tuesday: a faulty controller in
one of Discovery's in-flight maneuvering engines. Replacement is
expected to take two or three days.
   Workers also are removing and checking the high-pressure
oxidizer turbopumps from each of the three main engines, a
procedure that is taking several days.
   Earlier, the hydrogen fuel turbopumps in all three main engines
had to be replaced after a defective weld was found in a non-flight
pump.
   Technicians also are repairing several small areas on a segment
of a solid fuel booster rocket. In these areas, insulation
separated, or debonded, from the steel rocket casing either before
or during shipment here from the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah.
   Failure of a joint on one of Challenger's two solid fuel
boosters caused the shuttle's explosion and loss of its seven crew
members in January 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since
then.
   The redesigned booster has undergone extensive redesign and
successful test-firings in Utah. Three more full-scale tests must
be passed before the rocket is certified for flight. These are
scheduled April 20, June 3 and July 6.

<HEAD>Study Shows Blood Growth Factor Useful in Cancer Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A protein that stimulates the body to produce
blood cells may help doctors overcome a dangerous side effect of
intensive chemotherapy when treating cancer patients, researchers
said.
   The preliminary study is one of several under way to test the
powers of a newly identified class of growth boosters called
colony-stimulating factors.
   In the experiment, doctors from Duke University Medical Center
gave a growth factor to cancer patients who had also received bone
marrow transplants and chemotherapy to fight advanced skin and
breast cancer.
   Cancer drugs damage the bone marrow's ability to make white
blood cells. Without enough of the disease-fighting cells, patients
may fall victim to life-threatening infections.
   The goal of the latest treatment was to restore patients' blood
counts with transplanted doses of their own bone marrow, gathered
before the chemotherapy started, as well as injections of one kind
of colony-stimulating factor.
   The researchers found that the cancer patients' levels of white
blood cells recovered dramatically, and that the treatment ``may be
useful in reducing the toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy.''
   The study, directed by Dr. Stephen J. Brandt, was conducted on
19 patients and published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   In the research, doctors used a naturally occurring protein,
produced through gene splicing, that is called recombinant human
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
   At New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, Dr. Jerome Groopman
has used the same growth factor to boost blood cell levels in AIDS
patients. He said he believes the proteins will have broad
applications in treating cancer patients.
   ``Low white count leading to infection occurs in a number of
different malignancies,'' Groopman said. ``I think at the least it
will make it more manageable and help support cancer patients.''
   He said the treatment may also allow doctors to use higher doses
of cancer-killing drugs so that patients will have longer
remissions.
   ``The longer-range goal,'' he said, ``would be to improve the
cure rate in certain cancers.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Arthur W. Nienhuis of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute said the Duke researchers
``have achieved an important objective'' by showing what dose of
growth factor can be used safely.
   He added that the availability of the factors ``seems destined
to launch a new therapeutic era for those concerned with the
treatment of patients with bone marrow failure.''

   Two young hooded seals that beached
themselves earlier this year are now healthier and in need of a new
permanent home, but finding one isn't as easy as calling a zoo.
   Wookie and Sweet Pea may be adorable seal pups now, but they
eventually will become rather ferocious adults weighing more than
700 pounds each, said Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine
Mammal Stranding Center.
   In addition, a zoo or aquarium must have the proper refrigerated
pool to keep the seals comfortable, he said.
   ``I'm afraid this is a passing-through facility only,'' he said
of the non-profit center he runs.
   The two female seals beached themselves on Long Beach Island in
late January and early February, Schoelkopf said. Wookie was sickly
and bald; Sweet Pea was extremely ill and emaciated. Both had
bronchial infections that took weeks to clear, Schoelkopf said.
   The seals have regained their strength, fat and rambunctious
energy, barking at each other and romping in the center's pool, he
said. Now they must find a colder home ``or else I'll have to start
buying a lot of ice cubes,'' he said.
   ``Refrigeration is not so much the problem at this point, but we
start seeing stranded porpoises and sperm whales this time of
year,'' Schoelkopf said. ``There's no way I can put them in with
the hooded seals. ... These seals are not known for their
friendliness.''
   He said that releasing the seals to the wild would also be a
poor solution because they have become fairly docile.
   Sweet Pea is estimated to be only a few months old and eats only
when hand-fed. Wookie, believed to be about a year old, has bald
spots and could not survive sunburn, her rocky native coast of Nova
Scotia or skirmishes with other animals, Schoelkopf said.
   Hooded seals, named for the fleshy snouts of the adult males,
normally are never found south of Nova Scotia, Schoelkopf said.
That made them 1,500 miles off course when the reached New Jersey.
   ``It's like us planning to go to Florida and winding up in South
America instead,'' he said.
   He said the ideal situation would be to find a benefactor
sympathic to the plight of the stranded seals and other stranded
marine mammals who would donate enough money to build a nearby
facility for them.
   ``It would be a great tax writeoff, and we'd even name the place
after them,'' Schoelkopf said, only half-jokingly.
   The marine specialist has contacted an animal placement agency
in Texas that spread the word about the seals. In the past two
weeks, however, no one has expressed an interest.
   ``We're not trying to find just anyplace _ we want the animals
to go somewhere where they will be cared for properly,'' Schoelkopf
said. ``I want somewhere that has federal permits to handle these
animals, not a roadside attraction.''

   Chocolate lovers may soon be paying less to
satisfy their craving as a world cocoa glut pushes prices to their
lowest levels in six years, industry analysts predicted.
   World production of cocoa this season, which ends in September,
is expected to top 2.1 million tons, 6 percent more than last year
and a new record, according to the Gill & Duffus Group P.L.C., a
London-based commodities firm.
   The firm and the International Cocoa Organization predict
production will exceed consumption by as much as 150,000 metric
tons.
   Retail prices for individual chocolate bars may not fall right
away, but consumers may see a trend toward bigger bars continue,
slightly lower prices on bagged and boxed chocolates, and more
coupons and other promotional efforts, according to analysts and
Richard T. O'Connell, president of the Chocolate Manufacturers
Association.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No butts about it, New York City's smokers are
now officially prohibited from smoking in many of their old haunts.
   ``No Smoking'' signs went up across town Wednesday as
restaurants and other public places moved into compliance with the
city's new anti-smoking law.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and Dr. Stephen Joseph, city health
commissioner, hailed the new law on its first day.
   ``We're protecting the health of the people of the City of New
York,'' Koch said as he posted a sign depicting the Big Apple and a
crossed-out cigarette at the Tapis Rouge bistro on Duane Street.
   Jean Goutal, the bistro's owner and a former smoker, said he
likes the new law and may expand it to all of his 65-seat
restaurant. Currently, he has set aside half his tables for
non-smokers, as the new law requires.
   The measure restricts smoking in workplaces, restaurants,
hotels, theaters, large stores and taxicabs.
   Employers and businesses have begun to comply, although Joseph
said enforcement won't begin for two months. Koch said that would
give smokers 60 days to quit ``cold turkey.''
   There was no grace period at the New York Post, which has
snuffed out smoking in all its offices.
   ``It's going to drive people mad,'' said Marie Cundari, a city
desk assistant who planned to leave the premises every few hours to
smoke.
   ``You feel like you're in school. Then, you snuck into the
bathroom and if they smelled it, you were in trouble,'' she said.
``It's horrible.''
   Tensions also ran high among some restaurant owners.
   ``I have customers who've come here for 25 years and they are on
a certain table. Now, they say, `If I cannot have my table, I'm not
coming,' '' lamented Andre Soltner, owner of Lutece. ``How can I
please everybody? It's a nightmare.''
   Alan Nussbaum, owner of Club 1407 in the garment district, said:
``My complaint is that it's the restaurateur's job to become the
policeman.''
   Gregory Camillucci, general manager of the Russian Tea Room,
which phased in separate sections over the past three months, said
most of his customers are understanding. ``I guess maybe it's the
flexibility of good old New Yorkers.''
   Smokers still light up wherever they please at the Philip Morris
Companies. The law exempts tobacco businesses, including an annex
of the Whitney Museum in the Philip Morris building.
   ``In that area, common courtesy and accommodation and
consideration will prevail,'' said company spokesman Steven H.
Weiss.
   Philip Morris is mailing city businesses more than 81,000
pamphlets detailing the new law, as well as some 225,000 booklets
to smokers' households. ``We're going to continue to let smokers
know that you can still smoke in New York City,'' Weiss said.
   The literature says smokers have the green light in private,
enclosed offices; enclosed areas of restaurants, hotels, motels and
convention halls being used exclusively for a private function;
bars; restaurants with 50 or fewer seats and retail stores that
accommodate fewer than 150 people, if they post signs saying it's
permitted; and in other specially designated areas.
   Smoking has been limited in all city buildings since June 25,
1986, when the mayor issued an executive order.
   When enforcement of the new law begins, businesses that fail to
comply can be fined from $100 to $500. Individuals can be fined $50
per violation.

   Separated Siamese twins Benjamin
and Patrick Binder returned to West Germany today, seven months
after an operation in the United States separated their skulls and
circulatory systems.
   The twins arrived at Frankfurt airport this morning on a
Lufthansa flight from Washington, D.C., Lufthansa spokesman Richard
Gessner said.
   He said the twins were immediately taken by a private jet to an
undisclosed destination in southern West Germany. Gessner said he
did not know who had arranged for the private jet.
   The boys, now 14 months old, were released from Johns Hopkins
Hospital on Wednesday. Their parents, Theresia and Josef Binder,
accompanied them on the flight.
   The were also joined by several friends and a doctor from Johns
Hopkins, who traveled with the boys as a precaution.
   Benjamin will be allowed to go home immediately, but Patrick is
to spend at least several days in a West German hospital for
observation. Patrick's progress has been slower since he stopped
breathing briefly when he choked during a feeding on March 13.
   The two were separated during a lengthy operation in September.
   Doctors at Johns Hopkins said on Tuesday the boys have the
potential to lead normal lives, but emphasized that their
development has been severely delayed.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration cabinet has approved a
plan to spur trade with the Soviet Union despite worries that a
stronger Soviet economy could help its military, The New York Times
reported today.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity won the approval for the
initiative after two months of discussions in which the Pentagon
raised reservations while the Treasury and State departments gave
strong support, the newspaper said.
   The plan calls for the two countries to form high-level working
groups to prompt exchanges in the areas of food processing, energy,
construction equipment, medical products and the services sector.
   The meetings are scheduled to be held in Moscow next week, when
Verity and 500 American business executives will meet with Soviet
officials including leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Last year, U.S.-Soviet trade totaled $2 billion, down from $4.5
billion in 1979. Verity has said he hopes to see bilateral trade
reach $5 billion to $10 billion a year.
   ``The U.S. is going to have to get used to the idea that the
Soviets are good trading partners,'' Verity said. ``It's going to
take time to prove that this is beneficial to both sides.''

<HEAD>Glenn Turner Property To Go On Auction Block</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-story, 16-room castle owned by
onetime motivational entrepreneur Glenn Turner is going on the
auction block, with the Internal Revenue Service and other
creditors splitting the proceeds.
   Turner, 53, created a $300 million empire in the 1970s by
selling distributorships in his Dare to be Great and Koscot
International companies. But his empire collapsed after state and
federal investigators accused him of operating pyramid schemes that
bilked thousands of investors.
   Turner, imprisoned in Arizona prison for fraud, has owed the IRS
millions of dollars in back taxes for more than a decade, and the
agency has succeeded in foreclosure proceedings against the
property in Seminole County.
   The unfinished castle, its boathouse, stables and surrounding 79
acres will be sold to the highest bidder after a federal court
hearing April 26, according to court documents.
   The IRS, which had a $15 million claim, has been awarded a
judgment of $9.275 million, but appraisals put the value of the
Turner property at $1 million to $2 million.
   Before the IRS gets its share, Seminole County has the right to
collect $16,900 in unpaid property taxes for 1987, said county Tax
Collector G. Troy Ray.
   Private investors also have claims against the property for
$200,000 in tax certificates, under which they paid the taxes and
earn 18 percent interest until the property is sold and the tax
amounts are paid back to them..
   Turner and his family haven't paid property taxes since 1979,
but investors bought tax certificates equal to the back taxes each
year.
   U.S. District Court documents in Orlando indicate there are
dozens of other Turner creditors, but it is unlikely they will be
paid from any proceeds from the Castle's sale, officials said.
   Bids on the Castle property will be advertised over the next few
weeks to notify any other bidders of the pending sale.
   The castle and boathouse have been vacant for several years, and
the castle has been used only for tours by the public for
charitable events.
   Turner, the son of a South Carolina sharecropper and a
self-styled country boy, rose to fame in the early 1970s through
inspirational speeches that promised great wealth if people bought
distributorships in his operations.
   The companies collapsed in 1973 under lawsuits filed by
investors and investigations by state and federal agencies.
   Turner and a partner, Edward Rector, 57, were sentenced to seven
years in prison in Arizona in August on charges of operating a
pyramid scheme there and defrauding investors through a
self-motivational company called Challenge Inc.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University, declaring that it owns all of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers, has asked a court to order the
widow of the slain civil rights leader to surrender the documents
to the school.
   The university made the demand Wednesday in a counterclaim filed
in response to Coretta Scott King's suit seeking the return of
83,000 documents her husband gave the school four years before his
death.
   BU Trustee Melvin B. Miller, whose law firm is defending the
university in the suit, refused comment on the case, and Jim
O'Brien, one of Mrs. King's lawyers, said he had not reviewed the
university's counterclaim.
   The university argues that it not only owned the documents in
its possession, but also any other documents written by or
collected by King, who was assassinated 20 years ago this week.
   The university asked for a court order requiring Mrs. King to
surrender all her husband's papers, contending that she violated
King's pledge to BU and had ``wrongfully detained and converted the
remainder of Dr. King's papers.''
   BU also seeks damages, attorneys' fees and an inventory of any
King's papers that are in her possession or at the Martin Luther
King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta.
   In her suit, filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Mrs. King requests
that BU be ordered to give the King papers it has to the Atlanta
center, which was established in 1968 and contains more than
100,000 documents belonging to King.
   The BU collection contains speeches, sermons, letters and
photographs from the 1950s and 1960s, including the outline for his
famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech delivered at a 1963 Washington,
D.C., rally.
   King, assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, wrote in a July
1964 letter that the collection would become BU property following
his death. Mrs. King, however, claims her husband privately
indicated he wanted his papers stored permanently in the South.
   Mrs. King also accused BU of damaging her husband's papers by
mishandling them. In its response to her suit, BU contended that
any damage to the papers was caused by King, Mrs. King or their
associates.
   Central to the case is a one-page, typewritten letter dated July
16, 1964, from King to the BU library.
   King, who received his doctorate in theology from BU in 1955,
wrote that the library would be ``the repository of my
correspondence, manuscripts and other papers.''
   ``In the event of my death, all such materials deposited with
the university shall become from that date the absolute property of
Boston University,'' King said in the letter.
   BU contends the letter made it legal owner of the documents when
King died.
   Mrs. King and her attorney contend the letter is not binding.
They also have noted that King never followed through on a pledge
in the letter to make annual gifts to the university from the
collection.

   President Daniel Ortega put pressure
on Contra negotiators participating in cease-fire talks in Sapoa by
threatening to launch a major military offensive against the rebels
if the talks break down.
   Ortega also said Contra leaders in Managua for peace talks will
not be allowed freedom of movement to talk with internal opposition
leaders until rebel fighters have moved into designated cease-fire
zones.
   The president of the leftist government spoke Wednesday as
Sandinista and Contra military leaders reported making progress in
technical cease-fire talks they planned to resume today in Sapoa,
an outpost on the Costa Rican border.
   Key issues on bringing about a lasting peace have yet to be
negotiated.
   The Sandinistas launched an offensive against the U.S.-supported
Contras in northern Nicaragua last month. On President Reagan's
orders, 3,200 U.S. troops flew to Honduras on March 17-18 after
Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers
had invaded his country in pursuit of Contras.
   The U.S. troops never saw action and returned home at the end of
March.
   Finishing their fourth technical meeting, the military
negotiators in Sapoa agreed on seven zones in which Contra fighters
are to gather by April 15 _ two each in the north, central and
Atlantic Coast, and one in the south.
   Still to be worked out are details for the combatants' security,
the key issue of what needs to occur before the Contras lay down
their arms.
   The two sides also agreed to postpone until April 15 a
high-level meeting in Managua between Contra and Sandinista
political leaders. Those talks had originally been scheduled for
Wednesday.
   ``If the Contras don't accept the agreements, the people must be
ready for combat and ... launch an offensive with all available
force to be rid of (the Contras) once and for all and not prolong
the war,'' Ortega told farmworkers at an agricultural cooperative
in the eastern province of Granada on Wednesday.
   ``We have to fight so the (peace) agreements work, but for the
agreements to work we cannot let down the defense of the country,''
he said in the remarks carried by state-run Voice of Nicaragua.
   Both the political and technical cease-fire discussions are part
of a preliminary peace agreement the two sides signed on March 23
in Sapoa. The accords put into effect a 60-day truce last Friday
that aims to give negotiators time to arrange an end to their
six-year war.
   In his speech, Ortega said Contra leaders who come to Managua
for the high-level talks will be restricted in their travel in the
country until the rebels have moved into the cease-fire zones.
   ``They can come to Managua,'' he said, ``but to the meeting _
nothing more.'' The Contras have been pressing for permission to
move about freely during their stay, saying they want to meet with
opposition groups.
   They also have accused the Sandinistas of violating a provision
of the Sapoa accords calling for ``unrestricted freedom of
expression'' by not supplying newsprint to Nicaragua's only
opposition newspaper, La Prensa.
   La Prensa did not publish Wednesday and its publisher, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, told a news conference that the newsprint
restriction was ``a deliberate blow to freedom of expression in
Nicaragua.''
   The Sandinistas, who control the importation and distribution of
Soviet newsprint, say a shipment has been delayed.
   The Sapoa accords do not directly deal with the issue of a
Contra surrender of arms, of what will happen to rebel fighters
after they move to the designated zones and the cease-fire expires.
   The Contras maintain they will not lay down their arms until
they are assured of full democracy in Nicaragua. The government
says the putting down of weapons is ``indispensable'' to the
truce's success.
   The peace pact says the government pledges that ``individuals
who have been reintegrated into normal civilian life'' will be able
to take part in future elections. But ``normal civilian life'' is
open to interpretation in Nicaragua, where the government claims to
have 300,000 people under arms.
   In complying with the accords, the Sandinistas on March 27 freed
100 political prisoners. The Contras say only 10 of the prisoners
they requested were released. The pact does not give the rebels a
say in who is freed.
   Both sides declared a truce March 21 at the start of the talks
that led to the peace plan.

<HEAD>Rain in Michigan After Floods; Thunderstorms, Showers Over East
Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell across eastern Michigan today after causing floods
that washed out roads and flooded basements, while scattered
showers and thunderstorms dampened part of the East Coast.
   Stormy weather Wednesday brought winds gusting to 75 mph to
Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky, cutting power to thousands of
people and damaging buildings, including the world's highest, the
Sears Tower in Chicago.
   Rain today also fell in much of the Ohio Valley and the central
and southern Appalachians.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell in Maryland, Delaware
and eastern sections of Virginia and North Carolina. Thunderstorm
winds gusted to 49 mph on Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   Scattered rain dampened extreme Northern California and the
Northwest, with snow in the Cascade Mountains. Accumulations of 6
inches or more were expected in the Cascades in Washington and
northern Oregon.
   On Wednesday, a storm dumped more than 2{ inches of rain in
southern Michigan, flooding small streams and creeks and washing
out or flooding roads in Eaton, Clinton and Calhoun counties.
Basements were flooded in Eaton County.
   In Ohio, flood warnings remained in effect for the Saint Joseph
and Tiffin rivers.
   Winds gusting to 75 mph in Chicago cracked or blew out more than
60 windows in the Sears Tower, sent a 13-foot spire plummeting 28
stories from the top of the Wrigley Building and whipped waves up
to 20 feet high in Lake Michigan.
   High winds knocked out power to 30,600 customers in northern
Illinois, but most were expected to have electricity restored
today, utility spokesmen said.
   Gusts up to 74 mph were reported in Indiana and Kentucky.
Scattered power outages, minor building damage or downed trees were
reported. Winds of 40 to 50 mph were reported in northeast
Tennessee.
   High temperatures set records for the second straight day
Wednesday. Records dating back to 1910 were broken or tied in 14
cities in California, Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, New York,
Florida and Ohio.
   The mercury hit 93 degrees in Bakersfield, Calif., exceeding the
record set in 1960 by 3 degrees. In Tucson, Ariz., it was 92
degrees. The old mark of 91 degrees was set in 1952.
   Today's forecast called for rain across the upper Ohio Valley
and from New York to North Carolina; scattered showers, with snow
in the mountains, from the northern Pacific Coast to the northern
Rockies; strong gusty winds in the northern half of the Rockies and
much of Georgia and Alabama; and sunny skies across the Midwest and
the southern third of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s or 70s in much
of the nation; 40s and 50s from the northern Pacific Coast to
western Montana and from the Great Lakes to much of the Ohio
Valley, the Appalachians and the northern half of the Atlantic
Coast; 80s in the southern and central Plains and South Florida;
and 80s and 90s across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 26
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 77 degrees at Key
West Naval Air Station, Fla.

   Police searched today for two teen-age
suspects in the shooting of Grammy Award-winning jazz guitarist
Larry Carlton, who was wounded when he apparently surprised
intruders at his Hollywood Hills home.
   Carlton, 40, was in serious but stable condition today at St.
Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after undergoing four hours of
surgery, said nursing supervisor Debbie Fox.
   Police say he was wounded in the neck Wednesday afternoon after
he apparently encountered intruders in his hillside home in the
exclusive Lake Hollywood area, 10 miles northwest of downtown.
Detectives were looking for two teen-agers between the ages of 14
and 17.
   ``They were seen with a small German shepherd puppy,'' said
police Detective Ron Ito. ``We have no description of any vehicles.
All we know is they fled on foot down the hill.''
   Carlton's secretary was working at an office in the home when
the shooting occurred.
   ``She has no idea why it happened. We have no motive at this
time,'' Ito said.
   Carlton won a best pop instrumental performance Grammy this year
for his version of the Doobie Brothers' ``Minute By Minute,'' and
shared the same award in 1981 with pianist Mike Post for their work
on the ``Hill Street Blues'' theme.
   The musician toured with the Fifth Dimension vocal group during
the 1960s and was a member of the Jazz Crusaders during the early
1970s.
   His most recent work is the ``Discovery'' album, released by MCA
Records in last June.

<HEAD>Former Yugoslav Vice President Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hamdija Pozderac, who quit as vice
president in September after being linked to the nation's biggest
postwar financial scandal, died in Sarajevo, the Tanjug news agency
reported. He was 64.
   The official agency said Pozderac died in a hospital Wednesday
``as a result of a brain stroke which he suffered on March 29.''
   He resigned the vice presidency Sept. 12, 1987, after his name
was associated with the scandal surrounding Agrokomerc, a Bosnian
food-processing company that issued more than $1 billion worth of
uncovered bills of exchange.
   At the time, Pozderac said his resignation was of a ``principled
nature.'' If he had stayed in office, he would have taken over
Yugoslavia's rotating presidency this May.
   Pozderac's stance last September suggested he accepted no blame
for the Agrokomerc scandal.
   Several Yugoslav media reports have suggested, however, that
such fraud could not have taken place without the knowledge of
Pozderac and other Bosnian Communist leaders.
   Tanjug said the Yugoslav Communist Party chief, Bosko Krunic,
expressed condolences to the Pozderac family and praised Hamdija as
a man ``who dedicated his life to socialism.''
   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

<HEAD>U.S. Gives Boats to Fight Cocaine Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICARDO ROJAS LEON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin
Meese III handed over to this island's military authorities two
speed boats to be used to fight drug trafficking.
   The long, sleek boats were confiscated from traffickers trying
to smuggle cocaine into the United States, U.S. officials said.
They can reach speeds of 65 mph.
   Smugglers use this Caribbean island nation as a transit point
for cocaine from South America bound for the United States.
   ``The Dominican Republic seems to be determined ... that
narcotics trafficking should be totally eliminated,'' Meese told
Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, the armed forces minister, on
Wednesday.
   Meese spoke on the first day of a five-nation Latin American
tour. He arrived by Air Force jet and was due to leave Santo
Domingo today for Bogota, Colombia. Meese also will visit Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia.
   The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti. Drug runners have turned to the island as governments on the
neighboring islands of Jamaica and Puerto Rico tightened
surveillance of boats and planes.
   President Joaquin Balaguer, elected to a fifth term in May 1986,
has made the war on drugs a top priority. In December 1986, the
Dominican air force shot down a small plane that did not identify
itself upon demand. Officials later said it was carrying hundreds
of pounds of cocaine.
   In recent months, police and soldiers have seized cocaine
shipments weighing hundreds of pounds and valued at millions of
dollars. But suspected smugglers in high-powered boats often outran
the patrol boats of the Dominican coast guard.
   ``These (confiscated boats) are going to put the Dominican
Republic one step ahead of the smugglers,'' said one U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The boats were confiscated from traffickers apprehended while
trying to smuggle drugs into the United States, he said.
   One is a 31-foot Chris Craft Scorpion with twin 235 horsepower
Mercury engines and the other a 33-foot Sonic Carrera 33RX, he
said. The value of the boats, delivered from Florida by U.S. Coast
Guard C-130s, was not disclosed.
   The United States also plans to supply five small, twin-engined
Cessnas to the Dominican air force under the Military Assistance
Program.
   Accompanying Meese were his wife, Ursula; the chief of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, John Lawn; Frank Keating, the Treasury
Department's assistant secretary for enforcement; Mark Dion, the
State Department's deputy assistant secretary; and Mike Skol,
director of State's Office of Andean Affairs.
   On Wednesday, Meese met with Balaguer at the National Palace,
then with Foreign Affairs Minister Donald Reid Cabral.

<TEXT>
   A 90-year-old man who is
Florida's oldest elected official as well as one of the oldest in
the nation has won his sixth four-year seat on the town council.
    Louis Haas, a retired obstetrician, joined the council in 1968,
11 years after moving to Bay Harbor Islands.
   He's the oldest elected official known to the National League of
Cities and the American Association of Retired Persons in
Washington. ``And if I live another four years, I surely will be
(the oldest),'' Haas said after his victory Tuesday.
   Haas works at his $1-a-year post from 6 a.m., when he begins
reading, chatting with residents and signing city checks. Sometime
before noon he rides through town with the police chief on what
Haas calls ``inspection.''
   Afternoons are spent reading and resting for night meetings.
   Haas counts U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper, the 87-year-old Miami
Democrat and oldest member of Congress, among his friends.
   ``We often compare notes about this century with the last,''
Pepper said. ``We look forward to comparing the next century with
this.''
   A member of Columbia University's class of 1918, Haas has lived
alone since his second wife, Ceil, died in 1981. His first wife,
Sydelle, died in 1949.

   The Rust Belt is back, says Fortune magazine's
latest annual list of the 500 biggest U.S. industrial companies,
which boomed to record profits and sales led by a resurgent
smokestack America.
   A weaker dollar is helping manufacturers battle fierce foreign
competition, while economic fears raised by October's stock market
crash have faded.
   ``Across the Rust Belt you can hear the sound of champagne corks
popping and beer cans spritzing open: The Fortune 500 had its best
year ever in 1987,'' the magazine said in a cover story on the
annual list.
   ``After half a decade of sitting on the sidelines while the rest
of the economy boogied, the biggest U.S. industrial corporations
waltzed into the Great American Profit Party with record sales and
earnings,'' Fortune said.
   Fortune compiles the list of the 500 biggest industrial
companies every year based on annual sales of the previous year.
The list is in Fortune's April 25 issue, available at newsstands
Monday.
   Fortune said total sales of the 500 climbed 9 percent last year
to $1.88 trillion, up from $1.72 trillion in 1986 and higher than
the previous record of $1.81 trillion in 1985.
   Profits jumped from $64 billion to $91 billion, a 41 percent
increase that gave the 500 its biggest share ever of U.S.
industrial profits, Fortune said.
   The magazine attributed the performance to free-spending
consumers unconcerned with the stock market collapse, corporate
restructuring that has reduced work forces, and the weak dollar
that has made U.S. goods more competitive.
   The most powerful catalysts in the smokestack revival, the
magazine said, were basic industries such as forest products and
chemicals, which enjoyed the best advantage from the dollar's
protracted decline. Among paper makers, median sales increased 17.9
percent and median profits increased 60 percent.
   Profits at No. 183 Air Products & Chemicals Inc., a maker of
industrial gases, rose more than 30-fold to $155.6 million, making
it the biggest profit gainer on the list.
   Chrysler Corp. returned to the top 10 for the first time in a
decade, helped by its acquisition of American Motors Corp.
   The top six companies were unchanged from the previous year:
General Motors Corp.; Exxon Corp.; Ford Motor Co.; International
Business Machines Corp.; Mobil Corp.; and General Electric Co.
Texaco Inc., No. 7, and American Telephone & Telegraph Co., No. 8,
swapped places from the year before.
   E.I. du Pont de Nemours repeated in the No. 9 spot and Chevron
Corp. was bumped out of No. 10 by Chrysler's ascent from No. 11.
   This year's list contained fewer members of industries such as
building materials, food, industrial and farm equipment, petroleum
refining, rubber products, toys and sporting goods. There were more
companies producing chemicals, computers, furniture, metals, drugs
and cosmetics.
   Newcomers to the list included Sun Microsystems, a California
computer maker founded six years ago by four 27-year-olds, which
debuted at No. 463 after a 156 percent increase in sales and 300
percent jump in profits.
   Also thundering into the pack at No. 398 was motorcycle
manufacturer Harley-Davidson, which modernized its factories and
adopted Japanese-style production methods during the mid-1980s.

<DATELINE>QASEM, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
today asked King Fahd to rally Arab support for his Middle East
peace plan.
   Shultz, who arrived today, also was expected to discuss the
Saudis' purchase of long-range Chinese missiles.
   There were few public signs that either Jordan or Israel was
willing to accept Shultz's initiative. But Shultz looked to the
Saudi king to try to generate support within the Arab world for a
two-step plan for negotiations with Israel, a U.S. official said.
   The Saudis, whose oil wealth is used to support Syria, Jordan
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, repeatedly have affirmed
that they support a role for the PLO in any peace talks.
   The United States has refused to deal with the PLO until it
recognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces terrorism.
   After his meeting with Fahd, Shultz was to return to Jordan to
meet again with King Hussein. He met with Hussein Wednesday after
apparently failing to win over Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   The State Department confirmed last week Ambassador Hume A.
Horan has been withdrawn, six months after he took up his post in
Riyadh, the Saudi capital. No clear reason has been cited for his
recall. But it was widely believed that Horan was not considered
welcome in Riyadh following his protests over the Chinese missile
deal.
   Saudi Arabia stressed that it had not requested his transfer.
   The Saudis evidently bought the CSS-2 missiles from China,
keeping the United States in the dark, as a hedge against attack by
fundamentalist Iran, which has called for the overthrow of the
Saudi royal family.
   Shultz has expressed concern because the missiles can be fitted
with nuclear warheads. The United States has accepted Saudi
assurances the missiles are not nuclear-tipped.
   The American official said Horan's troubles with the Saudis were
personal and not political. He did not explain. The official
briefed reporters aboard Shultz's plane on condition of anonymity.
   A new ambassador, Walter J. Cutler, was expected to be named by
President Reagan shortly, the official said.
   Israel also assured the Reagan administration that it would not
launch a pre-emptive strike against the missiles.
   Israeli leaders have warned that the missile has a range of
1,850 miles, enough to reach their country, with which Saudi Arabia
and most of the Arab world is technically in a state of war.
   Pro-Israeli U.S. senators have moved to block U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have said the Saudis bought the
missiles in frustration over repeated attempts by Congress to block
American arms sales.
   The missile purchase has stirred a new U.S. determination to
carry out a one-year agreement with Western allies to keep
intermediate-range rockets out of the hands of Saudi Arabia,
Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and other countries in the region.
   While Saudi Arabia is not a direct party in the Arab-Israeli
negotiations Shultz seeks, the official said the Saudis would be
invited if they wished to attend.
   The possible participants are Israel, Jordan, Palestinians,
Syria and Lebanon.
   There were few public signs that Jordan was willing to embrace
Shultz's initiative following his apparent failure to win over
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Chants of ``Shultz, Shultz go home'' echoed through the Jebel
Hussein refugee camp in Amman early today as 200 Palestinians
staged an illegal march to protest the visit.
   Jordanian newspapers sharply criticized Washington's refusal of
Palestinian demands for an independent state or complete Israeli
withdrawal from lands captured in 1967.
   ``He should understand that his peace mission is a flop,'' the
daily Sawt ash-Shaab said in an editorial.
   At the halfway point in his second Middle East tour in a month,
Shultz told Israel Television on Wednesday he was still committed
to making his plan work.
   ``In all candor, I am not able to say that it is happening,'' he
said. ``While we have made some progress, differences have not been
substantially narrowed.''
   Shultz ended his visit to Israel on Wednesday without overcoming
Shamir's opposition to his call for an international peace
conference or to the concept of surrendering land captured in 1967
in return for peace. More than 135 Arabs, one Israeli soldier and
one Israeli settler have been killed in four months of
anti-occupation rioting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shultz then flew to Egypt for talks with President Hosni
Mubarak, who reasserted his support for the U.S. proposal.

   Two juveniles convicted of
trespassing at the Malibu home of actor Sean Penn and rock star
Madonna have been sentenced, but authorities refused to disclose
the outcome of the case.
   Authorities say Penn and Madonna confronted three men in their
home when they returned home shortly after midnight on Jan. 20.
Penn subdued one of them after a struggle by hitting him on the
head with a bottle of salad dressing.
   One alleged burglar was identified as Richard Barcelo, 20, of
Chino. He has pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges of prowling
and assault.
   But authorities never released the names of the two juveniles,
who faced sentences ranging from confinement at the state youth
authority to probation.
   Prosecutors refused to discuss the case after Wednesday's
sentencing, citing state law involving juveniles.
   ``They were disposed of,'' said Andy Reynolds, a spokesman for
the Los Angeles District Attorney's office.
   Penn plays a rookie cop in ``Colors,'' a film about Los Angeles
gangs scheduled to be released next week, and starred in ``Bad
Boys'' and ''The Falcon and the Snowman.''

   The Arizona Supreme Court is being asked
to cancel the May 17 gubernatorial recall election now that the
target, Republican Evan Mecham, is no longer in office.
   Meanwhile, a county court judge cleared the way Wednesday for
the new governor, Democrat Rose Mofford, to appear on the ballot if
the election is held.
   Both the suit and the favorable ruling were sought by supporters
of Gov. Rose Mofford, who took office in her own right after Mecham
was convicted by the Senate impeachment court on Monday.
   A suit filed by Phoenix residents Elinor Green and Joel Hunter
asked the Supreme Court to order acting Secretary of State Karen
Osborne to cancel the recall vote.
   ``The removal of the governor from office by impeachment, and
the swearing in of a new governor ... render the recall election
unnecessary and improper,'' said complaint said.
   The lawsuit was filed after negotiations involving Mofford's
chief of staff, Andrew Hurwitz, his law partner Bill Maledon and
Attorney General Bob Corbin.
   The plaintiffs' attorney, Andrew Gordon, said they were
challenging the recall as taxpayers who believe the cost is
unnecessary. Gordon would not say who was paying the cost of the
lawsuit.
   Earlier this year, Corbin issued a non-binding opinion saying
that even if Mecham were removed from office the election must go
forward.
   ``There's nothing in the constitution that says the recall
election stops'' if the governor is removed, Corbin said. Recalls
technically are aimed at the office, not the officeholder, he said.
   Mrs. Mofford has avoided talking about the possibility of being
a candidate in the recall election because of Arizona's ``resign to
run'' law.
   The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Tuesday.
Gordon said he hopes for an early decision because absentee
balloting is scheduled to begin April 14, two days later.
   Ed Buck, head of the Mecham Recall Committee which filed almost
400,000 petition signatures seeking the recall vote, said he
supports Mrs. Mofford but still believes the recall should be held
because ``you will never put the issue to rest until the people
have a chance to vote.''
   ``I think it's shameful that someone would attempt to overthrow
the constitution and cut out an election... That's the kind of
thing you do in Russia _ you try to cancel elections. You don't
cancel elections in America,'' said Republican candidate Jack
Londen.
   Mecham told a Republican audience in Mesa Wednesday night he
hoped to announce by Friday whether he will attempt to run in the
recall or try to appeal his impeachment conviction to a federal
court.
   Corbin and others have said Mecham is no longer entitled to be
on the recall ballot.
   In Maricopa County Superior Court, Judge Frederick Martone
rejected a challenge to the draft campaign that put Mrs. Mofford on
the ballot before she became governor in her own right. Mrs.
Mofford, the former secretary of state, became acting governor when
Mecham was impeached by the House on Feb. 5.
   Plaintiff Mike Morgan, a Democratic party activist, had
contended that Mrs. Mofford must file financial statements as other
candidates are required to do.
   Martone ruled, however, that financial statements are not
required in a recall election, and that Mrs. Mofford would not have
to file one in any case because she was nominated without her
formal consent.

   Lyndon LaRouche's lawyers have demanded access to
personal records of Oliver North, the former White House national
security aide LaRouche contends plotted to ruin him because of his
opposition to aid to the Contras.
   Their subpoena was revealed Wednesday at a hearing into whether
prosecutors withheld from LaRouche lawyers evidence supporting
defense claims that the FBI, CIA and other government agencies
harassed and infiltrated LaRouche groups. The subpoena was issued
Friday.
   Because of disputes over defense access to classified records
discussing possible infiltration, U.S. District Judge Robert E.
Keeton on Wednesday delayed resumption of testimony in the case to
April 19 at the earliest. The jury has been in court only one of
the past five weeks.
   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche political organizations
are charged with conspiring to stymie a federal grand jury
investigation of alleged credit card and loan fraud by fund-raisers
for LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign. Four of the
organizations are charged with fraud. The trial began in December
and is expected to last up to a year.
   LaRouche, who is seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, contends evidence of fraud and obstruction was
fabricated by FBI and CIA agents in his organizations. He says
North was behind the plot because of LaRouche's opposition to
President Reagan's aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The North subpoena demands that he surrender any documents in
his possession that mention the defendants, government witnesses or
three intelligence operatives who told the FBI they were asked by
top FBI and CIA officials to infiltrate LaRouche organizations.
   To support the subpoena, defense attorney William Moffitt cited
a memo in which retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord told
North of an apparent effort to collect information against
LaRouche. North and Secord have been indicted for their roles in
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Moffitt said North's lawyers have agreed to accept the subpoena
but have indicated they will ask Keeton to quash it.
   Washington attorney Brendan Sullivan, who represented North
during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, did not return
telephone calls seeking comment Wednesday. He was not available to
come to the telephone, his secretary said.
   Since the disclosure of the Secord-North memo a month ago, the
defense has pressed for access to a wide range of government files,
most of them classified.
   Keeton ruled last week that seven classified FBI files contained
information that should be given to defense lawyers. He said
Wednesday that an additional five classified FBI files contained
material relevant to the defense, involving an FBI informant who
also has worked for LaRouche.
   The FBI has refused to declassify the files on grounds they
would expose high-level intelligence sources and possibly endanger
national security.
   The defense lawyers have demanded that they be allowed to see
the classified files under a protective order that would prohibit
them from discussing their contents. Keeton is to consider the
issue Monday.

<HEAD>President Says U.S., Soviets Agreed on Aid Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Soviet-Afghan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq was
quoted as saying today that the United States and Soviet Union have
agreed to continue aid to the warring sides in Afghanistan, so a
peace accord can be signed ``any time.''
   The official Pakistani News Agency quoted Zia as telling
Parliament: ``According to unofficial reports, the two superpowers
have agreed on the symmetry under which both would be able to
provide continued assistance to their respective allies in
Afghanistan.''
   The issue of a cutoff of aid to the U.S.-backed Afghan
guerrillas and the Soviet-backed Afghan government has stalled the
Geneva peace talks.
   The Soviets have rejected U.S. demands that the cutoff be
simultaneous. The Soviets say their aid to Afghanistan's government
can't be compared to foreign aid to the insurgents, and they
maintain the issue is outside the scope of the Geneva talks.
   The news agency's report didn't elaborate on the ``unofficial
reports'' that Zia mentioned. It quoted the president as saying
that ``the Geneva accord could now be signed any time.''
   Zia also was quoted as saying that his country would continue
providing humanitarian assistance to the estimated 3.5 million
Afghan refugees in Pakistan until they can return home with
``dignity and honor.''
   According to the report, Zia told Parliament that Pakistan,
which has not provided military assistance to the Afghan
guerrillas, will not do so in the future. He said the United States
will continue to carry out that task.
   He said the United States was Pakistan's ``old ally'' with which
it enjoyed positive relations, the report said. The Afghanistan
situation had brought the two countries close, the president was
quoted as saying.
   On relations with the Soviet Union, Zia said there was no
dispute between the two countries.
   ``With the resolution of the Afghanistan issue, friendship
between the two countries would be strengthened. There exist
avenues for it,'' the news agency quoted him as saying.
   Zia also praised the Soviet leadership which, he said, had
``carried forward possibilities of friendship.''
   Zia also thanked individuals who he said had contributed to
reaching an Afghan settlement.
   In particular, he noted Diego Cordovez, the mediator in the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks, and U.N. Secretary-General Jose Perez
de Cuellar.
   He also praised the Western press, which he said had played a
``commendable role'' in keeping the Afghan issue alive.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Warplane Raid On Baghdad, Iraq Responds With Six
Missiles</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with details. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq bombed each other's
capitals and other towns today in one of the fiercest exchanges in
their ``war of the cities.'' Scores of people were reported killed
and wounded.
   The deadly duel erupted at dawn after Iran said squadrons of its
warplanes bombed Baghdad twice in the first air raids on the Iraqi
capital in more than two years.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said only one Iranian jet got
through to Baghdad and was shot down by an Iraqi interceptor inside
Iran after being driven away from the capital by heavy
anti-aircraft fire.
   But Iraq then loosed six long-range missiles against Tehran and
the cities of Karaj, the holy city of Qom, Isfahan and Tabriz, the
agency reported. Iran also reported bombing the northern Iraqi city
of Erbril and the southern ports of Basra and Umm Qasr.
   The sudden escalation overshadowed talks to resume in New York
between United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
and Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Larijani, on efforts
to arrange a cease-fire in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   ``Iran is determined more than ever to punish this criminal
regime in Iraq for its aggression,'' Larijani said after a meeting
Wednesday, indicating little change in Tehran's refusal to accept
the U.N. Security Council's July 20 cease-fire resolution.
   Today's sharp upsurge in hostilities came on the eve of
parliamentary elections in Iran. Officials fear the Iraqis will
launch a missile blitz when voters go to the polls Friday.
   Both sides reported scores of civilians killed or wounded in
today's missile attacks on Tehran and Baghdad and other cities as
well as air raids and artillery bombardments.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said Iranian jets penetrated ``sophisticated radar and
anti-aircraft defenses'' ringing the Iraqi capital to ``heavily
bomb selected targets.''
   It said the first raid at 6:05 a.m. scored ``accurate hits.''
   Another formation of fighter-bombers streaked above the city of
5 million people 10 minutes later, IRNA reported.
   IRNA said all the jets returned safely to their bases, but did
not say how many were involved in the attacks or give any details
of their targets.
   Although Iraq said only that one Iranian jet got through to
Baghdad and was shot down, the ferocity and scale of the Iraqi
bombardment indicated that the Iranian claim was probably true.
   It was one of the most widespread missile barrages the Iraqis
have unleashed since the latest bout of the ``war of the cities''
exploded Feb. 29.
   Iran said Iraqi warplanes also bombed Tabriz and other cities in
western Iran. In retaliation, the Iranians said they fired two
missiles into Baghdad and battered ports of Basra and Umm Qasr, an
Iraqi naval base, with 13 short-range missiles.
   Basra and other Iraqi border cities were hammered with artillery
fire, IRNA reported.
   IRNA said that other formations of Iranian warplanes attacked
Iraqi troop concentrations in Al-Amara, north of Basra, and other
areas in the southern front, ``inflicting heavy losses.''
   The Iranians have had some 250,000 men massed east of Basra for
weeks. But despite repeated air raids on Iraqi defenses, they have
made no move to launch a long-awaited offensive against the city.
   INA said two Iranian warplanes also bombed the northeastern city
of Erbil, killing several civilians.
   IRNA said Iranian fighter-bombers also attacked a headquarters
of the National Liberation Army, an Iraqi-based dissident movement
seeking to topple the Tehran regime, in the northern Diyala region,
``destroying all their targets.''
   Iran's air force has been badly depleted by combat losses and a
chronic shortage of spare parts.
   Outnumbered by around 8-to-1 by Iraq's powerful air force, it
has not raided Baghdad since early 1986. But in recent months it
has become increasingly aggressive.
   IRNA said the Iranian air raids ``completely caught the enemy by
surprise.''
   It said the warplanes destroyed Iraqi military basses in
Baghdad, ``killing or wounding dozens of soldiers.''
   IRNA quoted Iran's air force commander, Brig. Gen. Mansour
Sattari, as saying the bombing raids were ``unique and very
valuable militarily.'' He did not elaborate.
   Half of Tehran's 6 million people have fled the capital since
Feb. 29. Both sides have fired nearly 300 missiles into each
other's cities, killing hundreds on both sides.

<TEXT>
   Charges of trespassing and
disturbing the peace have been filed against an officer who
authorities say admitted he faked his own abduction in hopes of
gaining the attention of his estranged wife.
   District Attorney Joe Gay filed the charges Wednesday in Tippah
County Circuit Court against former Blue Mountain town marshal Gary
Stokes. If convicted, Stokes could face up to a year in prison and
$1,000 in fines.
   Stokes, the only lawman in the town of 870, was fired Tuesday by
the Board of Aldermen.
   About 200 law officers and volunteers searched for Stokes after
his patrol car and gun were found outside a store where he
reportedly had gone to investigate a burglary last week.
   Stokes reappeared early the next day in Myrtle, about 20 miles
southeast of here, saying he had escaped from his captors. But
relatives later said Stokes told them he'd staged the abduction to
gain the attention of his estranged wife.
   State Highway Patrol investigators said Stokes spent the night
following his disappearance in an abandoned house and then hiked
through the woods to Myrtle.

<HEAD>Rebels Condemn Ethiopian Order to Expel Relief Workers</HEAD>

   An Ethiopian rebel group charged today
that the Ethiopian government was trying to starve people by
ordering foreign relief workers to leave the war-torn and
drought-plagued regions of Eritrea and Tigre.
   ``The Eritrean People's Liberation Front calls on all charitable
organizations and those cooperating with them to oppose the
dergue's (Ethiopian leadership's) inhuman step and to help the
starving people in any way possible,'' the rebels' clandestine
radio station said in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi.
   Ethiopia's central government Wednesday told international
relief agencies to recall all their foreign workers in Eritrea and
Tigre ``to avoid personnel security risks'' from rebels.
   The government asked donors and the relief agencies to turn over
their operations to the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, the
government agency responsible for drought and famine relief.
   The rebel radio said the order was intended ``to starve the
people of Eritrea and Tigre and cow them into submission.
   ``For this purpose, the dergue intends to put the charitable
organizations' food, vehicles and other services to military use,''
the broadcast said.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the
central government in Ethiopia. It is Africa's longest civil war.
   In neighboring Tigre, another separatist group, the Tigre
People's Liberation Front, has been fighting for 14 years.
   The fighting has disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where
crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation. Overall,
nearly 7 million Ethiopians are facing famine without outside help.
   There are about 60 non-governmental relief organizations working
in Ethiopia, but only a few operate in Eritrea and Tigre.

<HEAD>Man Convicted Of Charges Related To `Soldier of Fortune' Murder
Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Tennessee man who offered no defense
on charges of directing an attempted contract murder that began
with a Soldier of Fortune magazine advertisement was quickly
convicted by a federal court jury.
   Jurors deliberated for about 1{ hours Wednesday before reaching
the verdict against Richard Michael Savage.
   ``The evidence was overwhelming,'' U.S. District Judge James
DeAnda told the jury after it convicted Savage on all seven counts
in a federal indictment.
   Savage, 39, was accused of arranging attempts on the life of
Colorado businessman Dana Free, including the Oct. 12, 1985,
grenade bombing of a Houston-area home.
   Free escaped that attack and two previous attempts in Atlanta to
bomb his car.
   The trial began Monday and prosecutors rested their case
Wednesday. Defense attorneys did not call any witnesses.
   Court-appointed defense attorney Michael Brown said he chose not
to present testimony because of Savage's prior criminal convictions
and a similar trial he faces in Georgia.
   Brown said he plans to challenge one of the counts against
Savage because he believes it charges him twice for the same
offense.
   DeAnda set sentencing for May 20. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary
Cobe said Savage could receive as much as 40 years in prison and
fines totaling $1.75 million.
   Savage was indicted in 1986 on federal charges he accepted
$20,000 from a Colorado woman, Alice V. Brado, to arrange the death
of Free, and later carried out attempts to have Free killed. Ms.
Brado claimed Free absconded with her $300,000 life savings.
   She found Savage through a ``Gun for Hire'' an ad in Soldier of
Fortune, according to the indictment.
   Ms. Brado pleaded guilty and died while serving a five-year
prison term in Kentucky.
   Three other people named in the indictment have pleaded guilty,
and testified that Savage directed the operation from Knoxville,
Tenn.
   Savage is serving a 40-year Florida state prison term for
arranging the beating death of the former assistant city manager of
West Palm Beach, Fla., in an attack arranged through a Soldier of
Fortune advertisement. He also has been sentenced to 25 years in a
federal prison for an Arkansas conviction for attempted
murder-for-hire and threatening a witness.
   Savage's trial was moved from Houston, due to publicity from an
unrelated civil suit in which a jury in Houston found
Colorado-based Soldier of Fortune negligent and awarded $9.4
million to the family of a woman killed in a contract arranged
through an advertisement in the magazine.

<TEXT>
   The 65 mph speed limit appears to be
partially to blame for a nearly 50 percent increase in traffic
deaths on rural interstates in New Mexico, the first state to raise
its limit a year ago, an official says.
   Ninety-five accidents resulting in 110 deaths were reported on
rural stretches of interstate highways in New Mexico between April
2, 1987, the day the law went into effect, and March 31.
   Howard Graff, chief planner of the New Mexico Traffic Safety
Bureau, said 64 crashes resulting in 74 deaths were reported for
the corresponding period the previous year.
   ``My opinion is that it looks like (the new limit) has had an
effect,'' Graff said Wednesday. ``Rural interstates are supposed to
be the safest of roads, with wider shoulders, medians and all
that.''
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released
figures last summer indicating traffic fatalities increased
nationwide about 50 percent within three months of the new speed
limit taking effect. States were allowed to boost speed limits to
65 only on interstate highways outside urban areas.
   Graff said traffic deaths in New Mexico more than doubled in the
first three months after the increase, but stabilized during the
winter.
   Al Lauersdorf, a highway safety specialist for the National
Safety Council in Chicago, said it is too early to detect a trend
nationally.
   ``My own personal observation is that there are some places
where you can do 65 and no one passes you with the exception of the
occasional leadfoot, and there are others where, if you go 65,
everyone's going by you,'' he said. ``It just doesn't seem to be
consistent in any way.''

<TEXT>
   A white South African member of the
African National Congress was seriously injured today when a bomb
exploded as he opened his car door, the national news agency
reported.
   AIM said Albie Sachs, a lawyer who works for Mozambique's
Ministry of Justice, apparently was on his way to the beach when
the bomb exploded under his car about 9:20 a.m. in the central
Maputo neighborhood of Polana.
   The explosion nearly severed Sachs' right hand from his arm,
turned his car into a twisted hunk of scrap and hurled it three
yards from the street onto the sidewalk, the news agency said.
   AIM said a child playing nearby and a man driving by in his car
were slighlty injured.
   The African National Congress is the major guerrilla group
fighting South Africa's white-led government.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing.
   The explosion shattered windows of the nearby Portuguese Embassy
, knocked branches of trees and apartment block windows into the
street and hurled pieces of the car as much as 50 yards, AIM said.
   Sachs was rushed to a hospital where he was in serious
condition, AIM reported.
   Sachs, in his 50s, was imprisoned in South Africa in the 1960s
and left the country after his release. He wrote a book about his
experiences, ``The Prison Diary of Albie Sachs.''
   Sachs lectured in law at the university in Maputo, and recently
joined the Justice Ministry, where he was drafting a new family law
for Mozambique, AIM said.
   The attack is the latest in a series carried out against African
National Congress members outside South Africa. At least six
congress members have been killed in countries outside South Africa
this year, and there were two car bombings involving congress
victims, in Botswana and Zimbabwe, in 1987.
   South Africa has denied responsibilty for the deaths, but
repeatedly has said it will cross its borders in pursuit of
congress members.
   A congress representative in Paris, Dulcie September, was shot
to death on March 29; the day after the South African army
confirmed it had raided a house in Botswana, killing three women
and a man.
   The South Africans said the four were ``ANC terrorists,'' but
the Botswana government said the three women were Botswana
citizens, and the man was a South African refugee who had been in
the country since 1979.

   Thousands of Jewish
settlers, some shouting ``Revenge! Revenge!'' attended the funeral
today for an Israeli girl stoned to death by Arab villagers.
Earlier, settlers attacked Arab cars and homes.
   Under heavy army guard, settlers carrying Israeli flags strung
with black ribbons buried 15-year-old Tirza Porat, who was killed
Wednesday during a clash between settlers and Arab villagers in the
West Bank town of Beita.
   ``Near the fresh grave of Tirza Porat, God will avenge her
blood. The heart of all the people boils over,'' Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir told about 9,000 mourners.
   ``Every killing strengthens and unites the Israeli people, links
it more to this land, deepens its roots here. The rioters and
instigators will not achieve a thing. They are leading their people
to tragedy,'' he said.
   Shamir was interrupted by cries of ``Revenge!'' and ``Expel the
Arabs!'' Many in the crowd carried M-16 rifles or pistols.
   The body, wrapped in a black tarpaulin bearing a white Star of
David, was carried in a 25-minute procession from the Elon Moreh
settlement, where the girl had lived, through the heart of the Arab
city of Nablus and past several Arab villages, to the Jewish
cemetery in Karnei Shomron.
   Tirza was the first Israeli civilian to die in four months of
unrest in the territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle
East war. According to U.N. figures, 140 Arabs have died, and one
Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded two Arabs today during clashes
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Hospital officials said Fathi
Mahmoud Sirhan, 20, of the Beach refugee camp in Gaza was wounded
in the chest and another 18-year-old Arab from the West Bank's
Qabatieh was shot in the abdomen.
   The army announced it had destroyed four Arab homes in Beita
belonging to villagers suspected of attacking the settlers.
   Thirteen Israelis were injured in the incident Wednesday.
According to army accounts, it began after Arabs stoned a group of
teen-agers on a hike. Israeli guards accompanying the hikers fired
on the stone-throwers, killing two Palestinians and wounding two,
the army said.
   Arab witnesses said the clash was provoked by Israelis. They
said the guards fired without provocation on Arab villagers and
that the villagers then charged the Israelis.
   Justice Minister Avraham Sharir proposed demolishing houses in
Beita and expelling hundreds of villagers allegedly involved in the
violence.
   Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, a Parliament member from the West Bank's
Kiryat Arba settlement, echoed the call.
   ``With an Arab village in which a pogrom on Israeli children
takes place, there's nothing else to propose but to destroy all of
the village, to wipe it out from the land of Israel,'' he told
Israel's armed forces radio.
   Throughout the night and into this morning, settlers attacked
Arab homes and cars, despite appeals by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, armed forces chief of staff, not to
retaliate for the slaying.
   Some called for Beita residents to be expelled to Lebanon and
for authorization allowing soldiers to shoot anyone throwing stones.
   Raja Salem, who had a swollen lip and a cut on his face, told a
reporter he was beaten up by settlers in the Arab village of
Hawwara, near Beita.
   ``Every house on the main road is in danger of attack now. They
want to retaliate. They want to kill us,'' he said.
   Aly Ahmed, 57, another resident, said ``everyone has clubs and
stones but that is not enough to face guns. Settlers using guns
come to humiliate us, but if we fight them, they will kill us.''
   The Maariv daily reported that dozens of villagers identified as
attackers by the Israeli teen-agers were detained Wednesday night.
It said they included a woman and her daughter suspected of killing
the girl to avenge the death of their cousin, who was killed during
the clash.
   Army spokesmen declined comment on the report.
   The army announced it was extending the closure of Arab schools
until May 8. The 850 Arab schools and five universities attended by
300,000 students have been closed since Feb. 4.
   Rabin, speaking on armed forces radio, said that Arabs
responsible for the attack had been arrested and would be punished.
He didn't say how many were arrested, and he noted that some Arabs
had tried to protect the Jewish teen-agers.
   Dozens of settlers held a vigil Wednesday near Beita and
announced they would build a settlement at the site of the clash.
   Leading right-wing politicians such as former Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon went today to Elon Moreh. About 100 men and women
gathered at the Porat home. Many of the men held M-16 rifles in
their laps as they waited for the funeral to begin. Some wept.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in an interview
published today, was sharply critical of Democratic presidential
contender Albert Gore Jr. for his attacks on rivals Michael Dukakis
and Jesse Jackson.
   ``It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous,'' Cuomo said of
the negative campaigning.
   The New York governor told The Washington Post in a telephone
interview that he is unlikely to make an endorsement before his
state's primary on April 19.
   ``The closer you get to primary day, the less reason'' there is
to announce support for one of the candidates, Cuomo said, adding
that he would prefer to remain neutral until after the final
primaries.
   ``That's the time for leadership in this process,'' he said.
   New York, already important by virtue of the 255 delegates at
stake in its primary, takes on an added significance because of the
seesaw race being run by Jackson and Dukakis.
   The two have remained close in the national delegate count.
Jackson finished a strong second in the Illinois primary and had a
major win in the Michigan caucuses; Dukakis came back with
victories in the Connecticut primary, the Colorado caucuses and the
Wisconsin primary.
   Cuomo said he expects the contest between Dukakis and Jackson
``will be very close here.''
   Noting that Jackson had garnered 26 percent of the New York vote
in 1984, Cuomo told the Post: ``You've got to give him 10 points
more than that this year. I'd say, 35 to 40 percent is his base.''
   The governor said his call to hold down negative campaigning was
``intended for all Democrats and specifically for Al Gore.''
   Gore has said both Jackson and Dukakis lack experience in
international issues, and has been particularly critical of Jackson.
   ``It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous and
counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the
nominee,'' Cuomo told the Post. ``You should not spend a lot of
time criticizing your opponents, especially if you have not
established your own identity in this state.''
   Another politician who has been vocal in his criticism of
Jackson has been New York Mayor Edward Koch. Cuomo said there was
little he could do to get Koch to heed his call to tone it down.
   ``The mayor has already ignored it and will continue to. I have
no hopes of conversion, short of his being struck in the tush by a
bolt of lightning ... and I have no command over the lightning,''
he said.
   Cuomo said he expected about 10 percent of the Jewish vote to go
to Jackson, despite the furor in 1984 over Jackson's reference to
New York as ``Hymietown.''
   ``Most of them (Jewish leaders Gore addressed last week) agreed
with him that Jackson should be defeated, but then the question
comes: Are you, Mr. Gore, the way to do it? The sophisticated ones,
who read the polls, may decide the best way to do it is with
Dukakis.''
   Cuomo said he expected black voters in New York, as they have
elsewhere, to ``go overwhelmingly for Jackson.''

   A man hospitalized since being left quadriplegic
by a gun-fired nail that severed his spine two years ago has
settled a lawsuit for $15.35 million and says he'll use some of the
money to help him return home.
   Eugene Doran, an insurance agent and Vietnam veteran, was
getting a haircut at a barbershop in suburban Andover on April 15,
1986, when he was hit by a 3-inch nail fired from a high-velocity
gun being used to install a storage chest next door.
   The settlement, reached Wednesday in the second day of a U.S.
District Court trial and described as one of the largest of its
kind in the nation, is to be paid by Taylor Rental Corp., its
Andover franchise and makers of the nail gun, said Doran's lawyers.
   ``Here's a guy who came through Vietnam and the Tet offensive
unscathed only to be shot down while having his hair cut,'' said
one of the lawyers, James Meehan.
   The 40-year-old Doran, who has been hospitalized since the
accident, said he will use part of the money to fit his home with
lifts and ramps.
   ``I'm just very relieved that one item _ a very important item _
is off our shoulders,'' said Doran, accompanied by his wife, Kathy,
at a news conference at the Veterans Administration Hospital here.
The couple have three children.
   ``I really have never had much anger ... maybe because it was an
accident,'' he said. ``I couldn't even tell you the man's name who
did it. I never asked. I have frustration at times ... and this has
changed my family's life. I'm just glad it's over.''
   Leo Boyle, another lawyer representing Doran, said the suit
cited Taylor and a Taylor franchise in Andover for renting the gun
after company headquarters ordered the units destroyed due to
insurance liability problems.
   A memo was sent to all Taylor company-owned rental centers a
month before Doran was paralyzed, but the approximately 250
franchised outlets were not notified, the attorneys said.
   The worker, an uninsured part-time carpenter, thought he was
working on a concrete-backed wall when he shot the nail at chest
level. The nail traveled through wood and sheetrock before striking
Doran in the side of the neck.
   The high-velocity nail-gun used a .22-caliber cartridge to drive
the nails at 700 to 800 feet a second, said Boyle. The guns are no
longer produced in the United States, although low-velocity
nail-guns are still in use, said Boyle.
   The settlement is one of the top five lump-sum compensatory
court settlements in U.S. history, said Donald Marshall, research
director at Ohio-based Jury Verdict Research Inc., which monitors
court awards.
   According to the settlement, Taylor will pay approximately $11
million and about $3.25 million will be paid by the nail-gun
manufacturers, Amca International Corp. and Desa Industries Inc.,
both of Hanover, N.H., and Desa International Inc. of Bowling
Green, Ky. The Andover franchise will pay the remaining sum.
Taylor, a subsidiary of Stanley Works, is based in New Britain,
Conn.
   ``I think it is clear that there were very serious injuries to
Mr. Doran and Taylor Rental Corp., which is a subsidiary of Stanley
Works, decided in the best interests of all parties concerned to
settle the case,'' said Ronald Gilrain, a vice president at Stanley
Works. The company expects to recover the settlement costs from its
insurers, Gilrain said.
   Jack Degange, manager of corporate services for Amca
International, said today the company would not comment on the
settlement. Mike Head, manager of industrial relations for Desa
International, said the company official authorized to comment was
not in the office today.
   The last known serious incident with a nail-gun also occurred in
a barbershop, Boyle said.
   A woman waiting for her son to get a haircut in the Akron, Ohio,
area was killed by a nail shot through a wall in October 1979.
Taylor Rental and the worker settled that case out of court for
about $1.2 million, Boyle said.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys say the
trial of a polygamist leader and three others charged in the
bombing of a Mormon chapel and a 13-day standoff with police will
proceed much more quickly because of the dismissal of a conspiracy
count.
   ``It relieves the government of proving a real complex count and
makes the issues in the case much clearer,'' Fred Metos, attorney
for defendant John Timothy Singer, said Wednesday.
   A pool of 170 potential jurors reported Wednesday to the
courtroom of U.S. District Judge Bruce S. Jenkins, where they
received a 20-page questionnaire and heard the charges.
   The federal charges now include bombing, destruction of the
Kamas Stake Center with an explosive, use of a bomb, attempting to
kill federal agents, assault on federal officers, possession of a
bomb, possession of a sawed-off shotgun and two counts of use of a
firearm.
   Vickie Singer is charged with all eight counts; polygamist
leader Addam Swapp faces all but the shotgun-possession charge;
Jonathan Swapp, who had not been charged with conspiracy, and John
Timothy Singer face the firearms, assault and attempted murder
counts. Jonathan Swapp is Addam Swapp's brother, and John Timothy
Singer is Vickie Singer's son.
   Associate Utah Attorney General Paul Warner said Wednesday that
state prosecutors would wait until after the federal trial to file
homicide charges in the death of corrections Lt. Fred House, killed
during the shootout that ended the siege at the defendants' farm.
   Swapp, 27, appeared in court Wednesday in a buckskin coat
emblazoned with a Mormon pioneer flag. His mother-in-law, Mrs.
Singer, 44, was dressed all in white, including a white bow in her
hip-length hair.
   ``It is turning into a nightmare,'' Metos said.
   ``I've done nothing but criminal law for 10 years, and I never
saw defendants do anything like that to draw attention to
themselves,'' he added.
   Although Jenkins granted the prosecution motion to strike the
conspiracy count, he denied requests from all four defendants to
separate their trials, U.S. Attorney Brent Ward said.
   The judge did not rule on a motion by Swapp that his trial
should be moved out of Utah because of the predominance of the
Mormon Church, which abandoned polygamy in 1890. Jenkins has said
he would rule on the issue during jury selection.
   Swapp has said he was chosen by God to gather the American
Indians for the second coming of Christ.

   Police reported 210 arrests today as they
ended a 13-hour sweep through gang-infested neighborhoods. In
nearby Pasadena, three people were wounded in what was believed to
be a gang-related shooting.
   A task force of 260 officers scoured gang ``hot spots''
throughout Los Angeles Wednesday night and early this morning on a
variety of charges, said police Lt. John O'Connell.
   He said 128 of those arrested were suspected gang members.
   Police set up a mobile booking unit in the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum just south of downtown, processing paperwork before taking
the suspects to jail on buses.
   O'Connell said there were reports of gunfire during the night
Wednesday, but there had been no gang-related shootings within the
city.
   In Pasadena, 10 miles northeast of downtown, three people were
wounded during a drive-by shooting that police said may have
involved gang members.
   Curly Robinson, 26, Charles Tolley, about 20, and Wilferd
Ogletree, no age given, all of Pasadena, were struck by shotgun
pellets fired from a passing car, said Pasadena police Lt. Lynn
Froistad.
   ``All we know is that a car came up and a passenger made some
statements at three people standing on the sidewalk. The passenger
then pointed a shotgun out the window and fired several rounds,''
Froistad said of the 9:20 p.m. attack.
   The three were taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital. Robinson
and Ogletree suffered minor injuries, while Tolley was in serious
but stable condition with wounds to his upper torso, said nursing
supervisor Betty Romero.
   More than 50 people have been killed and hundreds injured in
gang-related violence in Los Angeles County in the past year.
   Stepped-up efforts in the battle against gang violence in Los
Angeles included a city finance committee's approval Tuesday of an
additional $2.5 million for police to use in fighting gangs.
   The funding was expected to win final approval from the City
Council on Friday. It would pay for 1,000 extra officers to be
deployed in gang-infested areas and would cover police overtime
costs in fighting gang violence.

   David Holt is on the road looking for
traditional music and other celebrations of American life, from
banjo makers to washtub players to cowboy poets.
   Holt will begin reporting on his discoveries next Wednesday in
``Celebration Express,'' a new segment of ``Nashville Now'' on the
Nashville Network. The on-location reports, with upbeat and musical
themes, will run every Wednesday until Sept. 28.
   ``Nashville Now'' is a live, 90-minute variety series that
features the best of the country music stars. Next week, the show
will come live from Grand Cayman Island with such guests as Randy
Travis, Eddie Rabbitt, Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn and Hoyt Axton.
The host is Ralph Emery, along with his puppet, Shotgun Red.
   ``I travel all the time,'' said Holt. ``That's what I do for a
living, playing concerts. I've been collecting music and songs from
the old-time mountaineers for 20 years, so this is like an
extension of that.''
   Holt's first ``Celebration Express'' segment on the show will
come from Denver, a look at cowboy poet Baxter Black.
   Another Denver segment will feature Daddy Bruce Randolph, who
owns a barbecue restaurant and gives away an estimated 4,000 meals
a year.
   ``He's a real inspiration,'' said Holt. ``He's doing this out of
the goodness of his heart. He's been doing it since he was a child
and he's 88 now.
   ``Since this is a celebration of the Nashville Network's fifth
anniversary,'' Holt said, ``we're looking for people who are having
a celebration. Or whose very lives are a celebration. We're going
to travel 100,000 miles around the country.
   ``I'd love to see this become a series. It's been a wonderful
experience for me just in the short time I've done it. It's
wonderful to search out these people and spend time with them.''
   Holt, who previously served as host of TNN's ``Fire on the
Mountain'' series, is a musician, storyteller and historian who is
helping to preserve the Appalachian musical heritage.
   In San Diego, Holt found the Deering Banjo Co., which is one of
four places in the world that still make fine banjos. ``Most of the
craftsmen also play, and we got a little session going that I
joined in,'' he said.
   ``Long Beach is celebrating its 100th anniversary as a city and
I did an interesting musical piece. I played a 64-string dulcimer,
which is made of spruce, in the cockpit of the Spruce Goose. It
makes an interesting sound to play an instrument of the same wood
as the room you're in.'' The Spruce Goose is the flying boat built
by Howard Hughes in World War II, now on display in a Long Beach
museum.
   Holt then went to Claremont, Calif., to see David Lindley, a
musician noted for unusual folk instruments.
   ``He plays the Hawaiian slide guitar and the saz, which is a
Turkish instrument with a long neck and six strings,'' said Holt.
``It gives a haunting sound. Lindley is a very tasteful musician
who has mixed folk, country and rock. He recently was on the Trio
album with Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris.''
   Holt also talked in Phoenix to Marshall Trimble, who sings
traditional cowboy songs. Another trip took Holt to Florida and
Georgia, where he talked to a professional washtub player for Harry
Belafonte and Pete Seeger, some Mayan Indians who use an instrument
that takes five players, and an alligator trapper who has the
ability to call alligators.
   Holt has also been a musical goodwill ambassador for the U.S.
Department of State. Frets magazine named him the ``best old-time
banjoist'' and Esquire magazine picked him as one of its ``men and
women under 40 who are changing America.'' His newest album is
``Reel and Rock'' which features Doc Watson on guitar.

<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem militias fighting for
control of south Lebanon battled today with rocket-propelled
grenades and automatic weapons. Police said 18 people were killed
and 27 were wounded.
   It was the third straight day of violence between the
Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, believed
to be the umbrella organization for groups holding foreign hostages
in Lebanon.
   Thirty people have been killed and 61 wounded since Tuesday.
   A police spokesman said Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal
fighters, backed by armored personnel carriers, were advancing
slowly on Ghaziyeh, a key Hezbollah stronghold six miles south of
Sidon.
   Sidon is the provincial capital of south Lebanon.
   ``If Amal controls Ghaziyeh, then Hezbollah's remaining
strongholds will also fall eventually,'' the spokesman said. He
spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with police regulations.
   The official said Amal had seized 10 major towns and villages
and that Hezbollah still held four hamlets in addition to Ghaziyeh.
   He said Amal seized Nabatiyeh, a market town 18 miles southeast
of Sidon, in a ``sweeping attack'' before dawn.
   ``Rescue teams are searching the rubble of devastated houses for
bodies,'' the spokesman said.
   Six Hezbollah fighters, their hands raised, walked out of a
gutted house to surrender to Amal after the fall of Nabtiyeh. It
has a population of 50,000 people, most of them Shiites.
   The battle for the town lasted several hours as Hezbollah
fighters, holed up in a school belonging to the town's tiny
Christian community, traded rocket-propelled grenades and mortar
fire with the Amal militiamen.
   Tensions between Hezbollah and Amal have increased since Feb.17
when Amal blamed Hezbollah for the abduction in south Lebanon of
U.S. marine officer Col. William R. Higgins.
   Amal rounded up dozens of Hezbollah members it accused of
involvement in the kidnapping. Hezbollah has denied the Amal
allegations and accused the rival militia of ``harrassing the
believers by searching for an American spy.''
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, an underground group
believed linked to Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for Higgins'
abduction.
   He is one of nine Americans missing after being kidnapped in
Lebanon. American journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Asssociated Press, is the longest-held
foreign hostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   A British passenger freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti
jet in Iran was quoted today as saying that two of the hijackers
offered her pillows and drinks and chatted with her daughters.
   An Austrian businessman also released said the seven gunmen were
brutal when they seized the plane but later treated the hostages
well.
   ``We didn't have time to be frightened, things happened so
fast,'' British passenger Jean Sefton was quoted as saying in an
interview with London's Daily Mail. She spoke by telephone from the
Hyatt Hotel in Mashhad, northeast Iran.
   The Foreign Office confirmed today that all 22 Britons on the
plane, which has hijacked Tuesday on a flight from Bangkok to
Kuwait, had been freed. The hijackers were still holding about 50
hostages, including three members of Kuwait's royal family.
   They are demanding Kuwait release 17 convicted pro-Iranian
extremists.
   Austrian Josef Degeorgi, 53, who manages IBM's office in Kuwait,
was freed early today with 31 other passengers and crew members. In
a telephone interview from Mashhad, Degeorgi said the hijackers
were armed with handguns and grenades. All wore masks.
   At the start of the hijack the crew members were forced to lie
on the floor with their hands behind their heads, and some
passengers were handcuffed, Degeorgi said.
   ``At this stage things were quite brutal,'' he said.
   ``But they told passengers repeatedly to be calm, not to worry.
They were really very friendly to us. Some passengers got excited
and needed oxygen. But they (the hijackers) kept reassuring us.''
   
   Twelve British men were among 32 people released earlier today
and had been taken to the Hyatt Hotel, where they were reported
``fit and well,'' the Foreign Office said.
   Irishman Kieran O'Kelly and his wife, Nisran, also were freed.
   Mrs. Sefton and her daughters Jane, 14, and Patricia, 12, were
among 10 British women freed by the hijackers on Wednesday and
later contacted by the Daily Mail in repeatedly interrupted
telephone calls.
   ``One minute I was asleep, the next I was being nudged in the
ribs by my husband and I saw one of the hijackers in the aisle,''
Mrs. Sefton was quoted as saying.
   ``The hijackers weren't always within my view but I saw them and
one said, `Don't worry. Keep quiet.' ... A couple of the hijackers
spoke English and asked if we wanted pillows and drinks and things.
They talked a bit to the children.''
   Relatives of the Britons hijacked on the Bangkok-to-Kuwait
flight were jubilant at the release of their loved ones.
   ``We are obviously very relieved,'' said Brian Stillwell,
businessman father of 23-year-old Scott Stillwell, who was among
those freed today.
   Speaking from his home at Ryde on the Isle of Wight off the
southern English coast, the elder Stillwell added: ``It was an ugly
situation.
   ``These hijackings often end peacefully but who can be sure? It
has been a bad time. We are very pleased at the news. Now we are
waiting for official confirmation, but that could take a long
time.''
   Scott Stillwell, a commercial photographer, had been returning
from a six-month holiday in the Far East with his 19-year-old
girlfriend Elaine McIntosh, who also comes from the Isle of Wight.
She was among the British women freed Wednesday.
   ``We felt so helpless,'' said Margaret Jones, mother of British
hostages Mark Appleby, 23, and Nicola Appleby, 25.
   ``We have just been waiting from one news bulletin to the next,
hoping and praying they would be released,'' Mrs. Jones said from
her home in the western English port city of Bristol.
   Mark Appleby, a graphics salesman, and Nicola Appleby, a travel
courier, had been vacationing in Thailand.

<HEAD>Former Miss Minnesota-USA Pleads Guilty In Shoplifting Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Miss Minnesota-USA who gave up her
title after being arrested for shoplifting has pleaded guilty but
will not be convicted if she stays out of trouble and completes a
counseling program, her attorney says.
   Sue Bolich, 24, of Mound, entered the plea to a charge of gross
misdemeanor theft Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court.
   Her attorney, Peter Timmons, said she must take part in a county
pretrial diversion program for first offenders that includes
counseling and job assistance. If she successfully completes that
program, all charges will be dismissed in a year, he said.
   Bolich was arrested on Jan. 22 at the Southdale Shopping Center
in this Minneapolis suburb and charged with shoplifting a bathing
suit, scarves and hairpieces valued at around $370, authorities
said.
   She resigned as Miss Minnesota-USA on Feb. 8 and passed the
title on to Jolene Stavrakis of Apple Valley, first runner-up in
the contest, who also withdrew before the Miss USA pageant after it
was reported that she had pleaded guilty to shoplifting in 1986.
Second runner-up Julie Nelson eventually represented Minnesota at
the pageant in March.

<HEAD>High Court Won't Enter Fight Over Elijah Muhammad's Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Illinois Supreme Court today
refused to review an appeals court ruling that a $5.7 million bank
account controlled by the late Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad
belongs to his religious movement, not to his 22 children.
   In a brief order issued without comment, the state's highest
court let stand a 1st District Appellate Court ruling that a
Chicago bank acted properly in transferring the money to what was
then the Nation of Islam, the movement founded by Muhammad.
   Muhammad died in February 1975 without executing a will, leaving
open to question the control of bank accounts that had held $19.2
million in contributions from his followers.
   The rest of the money apparently was spent by Muslim groups or
Muhammad's relatives after his death.
   In 1986, a Cook County circuit judge ruled that Muhammad's seven
legitimate and 15 illegitimate children should inherit the
remaining money. The judge held that the funds were personal gifts
to the leader of the Muslim movement.
   The appellate court disagreed, saying that Muslim literature
indicated the donations were to be used for ``the care of the poor
and needy members.''
   The Nation of Islam, founded by Muhammad in the 1930s,
fragmented after his death. One group, led by one of Muhammad's
sons, became known as the American Muslim Mission, while a group
led by Louis Farrakham took over the name Nation of Islam.

   Iranian workmen began refueling a Kuwaiti
jetliner today after hijackers holding 50 hostages fired five shots
at police and threatened to take off with near-empty tanks, the
Iranian news agency said.
   The gunmen earlier threatened to blow up the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 747 and demanded that the runway at Mashhad airport in
northeastern Iran be cleared, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported. IRNA said that the taxiway had been closed ``to prevent
the plane from flying.''
   ``Disciplinary and relief forces are on full alert while the
situation is presently out of control and anything may happen at
any moment,'' said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia. It said an Iranian
delegation in contact with the hijackers was advising them to
``keep cool.''
   The shooting erupted after the hijackers demanded that the plane
be refueled and allowed to take off for an undisclosed destination,
IRNA said. Iran had refused.
   The agency did not mention any casualties in the gunfire.
   Earlier, IRNA reported that ``Iranian officials have announced
they would supply the hijackers with food and fuel provided that
the passengers and crew members be released.''
   But the refueling went ahead without any release being reported.
   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait free 17 convicted
pro-Iranian extremists.
   A member of the Kuwait royal family held on the plane appealed
to Iranian authorities to provide the plane with fuel to take off.
   ``We're very tired and our brothers (the hijackers) are very
serious in their threat to blow up the plane,'' Fadel Khaled
Al-Sabah told the control tower by radio, IRNA said.
   The Iranian agency said officials at Mashhad Airport in
northeast Iran ``urged the hijackers to give up their threats,''
   The hijackers forced the Kuwait Airways airliner to land Tuesday
after seizing it on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait.
   The hijackers, armed with grenades and guns, are holding about
50 hostages, including three members of Kuwait's royal family.
Fifty-seven people have been freed since the plane landed,
including 32 released early today.
   Austrian passenger Josef Degeorgi, released today, said the
seven gunmen were brutal when they seized the plane but later
treated the hostages well. British passenger Jean Sifton, who was
freed Wednesday, said two of the hijackers had offered her pillows
and drinks and chatted with her daughters.
   IRNA quoted Iran's deputy prime minister, Ali Reza Moayerri, as
saying failure to negotiate an end to the hijack drama could ``God
forbid, lead to unpredictable events.''
   It quoted him as saying the Kuwaiti negotiators sent to Mashhad
airport in northeastern Iran appeared to ``attach no importance to
the lives of their own citizens'' aboard the plane.
   Moayerri, in charge of negotiating with the hijackers, was
quoted as saying: ``While we're trying to put an immediate end to
the hijacking, the Kuwait delegation seems to have no authority to
make any decision here.''
   The hijackers warned in an ultimatum radioed to the Mashhad
tower that they would blow up the jet if there was ``any threat
against the plane'' by Iranian security forces, IRNA said. IRNA did
not say if the hijackers indicated where they planned to fly to.
   The warning came after senior Kuwaiti officials at the airport
said they would negotiate only after the remaining hostages still
being held were released. The remaining hostages were believed to
all be Arabs, including at least 30 Kuwaitis.
   IRNA said the hijackers declared in statement:
   ``We give the Kuwaitis until noon (4:30 a.m. EDT) and if they do
not give a positive reply to our demand, we will leave Mashhad
airport.
   ``We warn that we will not tolerate any threat against the plane
and declare we are ready to blow it up.''
   Earlier today, the hijackers singled out the three members of
the Kuwaiti royal family, two of them women, who they said will be
among the first passengers ``to pay a dear price'' if Kuwait does
not meet their demand.
   The hijackers are demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian
extremists imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in that Persian Gulf state in 1983.
   Kuwait rejected the demand, calling it ``blackmail.''
   The nationality of the hijackers was not known. Hostages who
have been freed said there are five or six hijackers, all wearing
masks.
   Twenty-four female hostages were released on Wednesday and a
Jordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on Tuesday.
   The members of the Kuwait royal family aboard are Al-Sabah, a
businessman, and his sisters, Ebtesam and Anware.
   Release of the 17 jailed extremists has been a recurring demand
of Shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   Many acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on Shiite
Moslems acting for Iran, which has been at war with Iraq since
September 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding Iraq.

   Vice President George Bush, his bitter fight
for the Republican presidential nomination against Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole behind him, says he wants Dole to help him win the
general election in the fall.
   The two men met privately Wednesday in the Capitol for the first
time since their angry face-off on the Senate floor last February.
Bush told reporters afterward that they had a ``good, friendly
discussion.''
   At an earlier session in the same building, Dole had lunch with
Pat Robertson, who is continuing a half-hearted campaign to be GOP
presidential nominee. They discussed ways to keep the former
television evangelist's supporters active in Republican politics.
   ``There's no question that we plan to support the Republican
nominee, and it looks as though it's going to be George Bush,''
Robertson said.
   Robertson said he wanted to be ``a rallying point for
conservatives'' at the GOP convention in New Orleans so he could
encourage his supporters to remain involved in Republican politics.
   ``I want to make sure that it's the type of platform that will
make them get in with both hands and both feet and go to work,'' he
said.
   Robertson told The New York Times he would not campaign in New
York before the April 19 primary. His Secret Service protection was
withdrawn at his request Wednesday.
   In an interview published in today's editions of the paper, he
said it would be ``more quixotic than it is realistic'' to continue
actively campaigning.
   A Robertson spokeswoman, Barbara Gattulo, said today he would
make ``two or three'' speeches a week supporting conservative
causes and candidates, and go to the Republican National Convention
``whether we add delegates before then or not.''
   ``He has made a committment to supporters and a number of
candidates in races around the counry at the local level,'' said
Gattulo. ``No matter how many delegates he takes (to the
convention), he will have a voice there. He is also laying the
foundation for years to come, as a conservative voice and for a
future campaign.''
   ``He has already talked about running in 1992,'' she said.
   Robertson had already laid off most of his campaign staff and
has made only a few campaign appearances recently, because he is
bumping up against federal campaign spending limits.
   After his talk with Dole, Bush told reporters that he wanted the
Kansan to work on his behalf ``as much as he possibly has time to
give. A lot of it's here and a lot of it I hope will be around the
country.''
   ``We're ready to go to work,'' Dole said.
   Asked whether the two men had buried the hatchet, Dole said, ``I
don't have a hatchet. I'm a nice fellow.''
   Bush said their conversation focused on ``how to beat
Democrats.''
   Dole spokesman Walt Riker said later that the men talked about
``keeping the Republican nomination interesting until the
convention'' in August and ``ways to get the issues out there.''
   During a Senate vote last Feb. 4, Dole walked up to Bush and
accused him of condoning a campaign attack that amounted to
``groveling in the mud.''
   The face-off was sparked by a written statement made by a Bush
campaign aide implying that Dole accepted favors from the wealthy.
It also said three federal agencies were examining a defunct blind
trust once held by his wife, Elizabeth H. Dole.
   Dole dropped out of the race and endorsed Bush last month.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the joint statement issued
Thursday by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan leader
Najib after their meeting in the Soviet city of Tashkent. The
excerpts were carried in English by the Soviet news agency Tass.
   As a result of the meeting, Gorbachev and Najib arrived at a
common view on the following:
   _The Soviet Union and the republic of Afghanistan will act in
accordance with the statements published on Feb. 8, 1988. These
statements imparted a new impulse to the process of the political
settlement of the most complex regional conflict and made it
possible to place negotiations on the plane of a practical solution.
   _The general secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee
and the president of Afghanistan believe that the last obstacles to
concluding the agreements have now been removed, thanks to
constructive cooperation of all who are involved in the settlement,
and favor their immediate signing.
   Both sides duly assess the role of the U.N. secretary-general
and his personal representative, Diego Cordovez.
   The Afghan president welcomes the readiness of the Soviet Union
and the United States to act as guarantors of the Geneva accords.
   _The Soviet Union and Afghanistan reaffirm that in the event of
the conclusion within the shortest period of the said agreements,
the Afghanistan-USSR understanding that the Soviet troops will be
withdrawn within the period fixed by these agreements, starting
from May 15, 1988, will remain in force.
   _The policy of national reconciliation makes it possible to
settle the situation around Afghanistan, end the war and
fratricide, establish peace throughout the country's territory and
form a coalition government with the participation of all forces
representing Afghan society, including those who are currently
opposed to one another.
   _The final status of their country among other states will be
determined by the Afghans themselves and nobody but them. The
Soviet Union reaffirms its support for President Najib's statement
on Afghanistan as an independent, non-aligned and neutral state.
   It proceeds from the premise that the territory of that country
or any of its part will never be used for purposes hostile to its
neighbors with regard to which Afghanistan will continue a policy
of good-neighborly relations and cooperation.
   This equally applies to the Soviet Union, the People's Republic
of China, the republic of India, the Islamic republic of Pakistan
and the Islamic republic of Iran. The Soviet side backs the Afghan
president's statement to the effect that Afghanistan's internal
structure will rest on a multi-party system in the political field
and on a multi-sectoral basis in the economic sphere.
   _It is of key importance for implementing the policy of national
reconciliation to create satisfactory conditions for the return of
Afghan refugees ... and grant them rights on an equal basis with
all citizens of the country. The Soviet Union will extend
assistance to Afghanistan in creating such conditions.
   _The Soviet Union, relying on relations of traditional and
historical friendship, expresses the readiness to cooperate with
Afghanistan at a high level ... to restore the economy and
facilitate the economic and social development of ... Afghanistan.
   _The general secretary and the president call on other states to
contribute to establishing peace and national reconciliation in
Afghanistan and respect the Geneva accords. This would set a good
and encouraging example for resolving other regional conflicts.

   A man who believes some police officers have
a ``fascist'' background was dismissed today as a juror in the
cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr.
   Zaccaro, son of former Democratic vice-presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro, is charged with selling a small amount of
cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago.
   On Wednesday, District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey had refused
to dismiss Christopher Mayka from the jury, despite objections from
the prosecutor about Mayka's comments on police.
   Under questioning, Mayka had said, ``I have often felt that some
people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background.
They like to have power.''
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn renewed the argument
today, telling the judge that Mayka ``has preconceived notions
about police officers.'' McCaffrey then agreed to dismiss Mayka.
   The feelings about police are important in the case because the
defense wants to show that Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury
College, was entrapped by an undercover police officer acting only
on rumor.
   Lawyers had hoped to start opening arguments today, but the
dismissal of Mayka and slow questioning of replacements may delay
those arguments until Friday. Jury selection began Monday.
   Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view of the case.
   But most said they were aware of the case, prompting the two
sides to repeatedly ask whether the jurors' deliberations would be
affected by what they know.
   Although both the state and the defense have said they were
fearful of the effect of the pre-trial publicity, many of the
potential jurors said they discounted what they had read, because
of a distrust of the press.
   ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because
they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi on Wednesday.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have attended the
questioning, which is taking place in the cramped chambers of the
presiding judge to put the potential jurors at ease.
   The process has shed some light on the strategies lawyers may
take in the trial.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn has asked potential
jurors if they have any objections to police acting on rumors and
to the use of undercover police officers.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro after
hearing he was dealing drugs.
   Defense lawyer Charles Tetzlaff has asked jurors if they would
be willing to acquit someone based on a technical defect in the
state's case.
   The defense is expected to try to prove that Zaccaro was
entrapped by the police, and that the police singled him out
because of his famous mother.

   A jump in the Dow Jones industrial average
tested the New York Stock Exchange voluntary limit on computerized
program trading for the first time, but Wall Street experts differ
on whether the restriction matters.
   Traders said a cheer erupted on the Big Board's vast floor when
the widely-followed average careened past 50 points at about 3:20
p.m Wednesday, automatically placing the ``collar'' on so-called
index arbitrage trading for the rest of the day. The Dow average
closed at 2,061.67, up 64.16 points.
   The momentum of that rally helped inspire strong buying in Tokyo
today that pushed prices past their pre-crash levels. On the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues,
which gained 195.82 points Wednesday, gained another 258.05 today,
reaching 26,769.22.
   In London, the London Financial Times 100-share index was up
about 22 points to the 1767 level by late afternoon.
   But as of late morning in New York, however, the momentum
stalled and the Dow Jones average was off about two points to the
2,059 level.
   Although the average had flirted with a 50-point daily up or
down limit at least four times since the restriction was announced
Feb. 4, Wednesday marked the first time the threshold was breached.
   The collar is part of an effort to suppress wild price swings in
the aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash and restore investor
confidence. Some traders said that without the limit, the Dow
average might have risen as much as 100 points Wednesday, but
others said it was impossible to know.
   ``There was a lot of program trading when the Dow was up between
35 and 49 points,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager of institutional
trading at Dillon Read & Co. ``It went from 40 to 49 within five
minutes.''
   Several other influences boosted stocks, notably a stronger
dollar and lessening fears of higher interest rates. But many
brokers said program trading played at least a partial role in the
Dow's sudden surge.
   Program trading refers to a sophisticated form of arbitrage, the
simultaneous purchase and sale of similar goods in different
markets in order to profit from price disparities.
   Using computers that instantly place massive orders, program
traders buy stocks in New York and sell corresponding stock-index
futures in Chicago, or vice versa.
   Many brokers have blamed the technique for injecting enormous
volatility _ as well as crushing trading volume _ into the stock
market without regard for underlying stock values. Some studies
have suggested program trading was an important element in the
October crash.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said Wednesday after the
50-point collar was triggered that ``it's not the solution but it's
clearly a first step in controlling what we call intra-day
volatility.''
   Asked how far the Dow average would have moved without the
limit, Torrenzano said, ``If you talked to 10 people you'd get 10
different answers. I have no idea.''
   Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp., which
utilizies program trading, said he believed the technique wasn't an
element in the Dow's rise Wednesday, largely because the price
disparities between stocks and stock-index futures weren't
profitable enough for widespread arbitrage.
   ``It's sort of a non-event,'' he said. ``Program trading wasn't
fueling the up move. I don't think there was any particular rhyme
or reason to it.''
   Others said the reaching of the limit caused the Dow to retreat
several points before it began moving up again, but at a slower
pace that reflected the absence of program trading's influence.
   ``Without the restriction, I think you would have seen it up 100
points today,'' Puccio said. ``I think the limit is good because it
gives people a little pause to reflect rather than buying with
abandon.''

Dutch retail tycoon Gerrit-Jan Heijn buried in a forest seven
months after his abduction, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office
said today.
   Heijn was kidnapped last Sept. 9 and shot through the head the
same day. His body was exhumed in a forest near the town of Renkum
in the eastern Netherlands on the instructions of his suspected
killer, who was arrested Wednesday, according to spokesman Theo Bot.
   The discovery ended the longest-running kidnap case in Dutch
criminal history. The tycoon's family had paid the kidnappers a $4
million ransom in a bid to win his release.
   Heijn, who was 56 when he died, was vice president of Ahold,
which owns the Netherlands' largest chain of supermarkets as well
as the Giant Food and Bi-Lo stores in the United States.
   On Wednesday, authorities arrested a 45-year-old unemployed
architect, his wife, his three children aged 17 to 25 and a house
guest at the suspect's home in the village of Landsmeer, 10 miles
north of Amsterdam. The guest was released later.
   According to Bot, the architect was found in possession of the
murder weapon as well as a ransom worth more than $4.5 million paid
for Heijn in a Nov. 27 drop.
   Heijn was abducted on Sept. 9 while on his way to a dental
appointment from his sprawling villa in Bloemendaal, an affluent
suburb of this western Dutch city.
   After the estimated $4 million in diamonds and cash was paid in
November, nothing was heard from the kidnapped businessman or his
abductors.
   The kidnapping case was marked by lengthy and fruitless
negotiations between the Heijn family and the abductors via
advertisements published in various national newspapers. Police
imposed a news blackout only a few days after Heijn was kidnapped
at the request of the family.
   On Oct. 14, after Heijn's relatives had demanded a sign of life
from the kidnap victim, the abductors mailed what appeared to be
his little finger. At the time, it could not be established whether
Heijn had been alive or dead when the finger was cut from his hand.
   Stymied by the silence maintained by the abductors after the
ransom drop, police staged a massive media blitz late December,
when the authorities showed the scant evidence available in a
nationally televised news conference.
   That event triggered a flow of about 12,000 tips, which have
been checked by the 40-strong detective force permanently assigned
to the case.
   The suspect's house was kept under surveillance by detective
teams for six weeks, the reports said. Early Wednesday morning,
heavily armed police raided the house, a small four-room,
semi-detached building, surprising the suspects in their sleep,
according to the newspapers.
   The main suspect was identified by the newspapers as Ferdi E. No
immediate confirmation of his identity could be obtained from
police.
   The five suspects were being kept in police custody here pending
charges, the reports said.

   Jewish activists who consider Jesse Jackson
anti-Semitic, anti-Israel or both are mobilizing to turn voters
against his Democratic presidential bid in the crucial New York
primary.
   Even though his efforts to make peace with Jews appear to have
diminished the degree of antipathy toward him since 1984, lingering
suspicion has set the stage for what may become the most negative
response to his 1988 campaign,
   New York Mayor Ed Koch's assessment of the situation was
summarized in a New York Post headline last weekend _ ``Koch to
Jews: `You've got to be crazy to vote for Jesse.'''
   ``I'm getting dozens of letters every week with expressions of
concern about the Jackson campaign,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center For Holocaust Studies in Los Angeles.
``We will absolutely not support a Jackson candidacy ... because he
is not a friend of the state of Israel.''
   In Indianapolis on Wednesday, Jackson was asked how he expected
to fare among New York's Jewish voters.
   ``You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. ``All you
can do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see people
are responding.''
   The New York Post reported today that Jackson campaign advisers
have suggested tackling the problem directly. They propose either a
private session with members of the New York Jewish Community
Relations Council, an umbrella group of local Jewish organizations,
or a public speech to the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations.
   Jackson's support for setting up a Palestinian state does not go
over well with Jews, who are not pacified by his talk of the need
to secure Israel's borders as well.
   A widely circulated photograph of Jackson embracing Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat further hurt Jackson's
reputation with Jews.
   In addition, Jewish voters have not forgotten that during his
1984 presidential campaign, he used the offensive terms ``Hymie''
and ``Hymietown,'' and he associated with Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan, who called Judaism a ``dirty religion.''
   The support Jackson enjoys among Arab-Americans is simply
another reason Jews find to be suspicious. They are not swayed by
the fact that he has a Jewish campaign manager, Gerald Austin.
   Jackson says Farrakhan ``is not part of my campaign'' and that
he is not in communication with him. Jackson apologized for his use
of the Hymie term.
   But these issues will no doubt come to the fore in New York
where the active and large Jewish population is a significant
portion of the electorate.
   In New York, Koch has poured out anti-Jackson commentary, while
Jackson's rivals Albert Gore Jr. and Michael Dukakis are
highlighting Middle East issues in their campaigns.
   In addition, two Jewish committees have formed to distribute
material and demonstrate against Jackson.
   A New York poll by the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion in mid-March showed that Jackson has made some headway
among Jewish voters. Thirty-six percent had a favorable opinion of
him, while 43 percent were unfavorable, compared to 17 percent
favorable and 62 percent unfavorable in January.
   But that doesn't mean they will vote for him when given
alternative Democrats, several Jewish leaders said.
   ``A vast majority of Jews will not vote for him,'' said Michael
Miller, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations
Council of New York.
   Dov Hikind, a Jewish state assemblyman from Brooklyn, said, ``If
Jesse Jackson is on the ticket or even in a position where it is
clear that he is going to be a major player after the election, my
district will overwhelmingly vote Republican. I will speak in favor
of the Republican Party. There's no doubt about it.''
   He said his Coalition for a Positive America will distribute
leaflets at Jackson public events. A Cornell University group and
Americans against Jackson, a Jewish-oriented group, are planning
anti-Jackson demonstrations.
   Already, the groups are circulating flyers with a photograph of
Jackson and ``his best friend Louis Farrakhan.''
   Jackson strategists have said there are no plans to change the
overall campaign strategy to deal with Jewish complaints. They
point out he has spoken on pro-Jewish issues such as Soviet Jewry
and the need for a secure Israel.
   ``There are some people who won't let go of the past,'' said
Jackson foreign policy adviser Bob Borosage. He noted that since
1984 Jackson has met with many Jewish groups and leaders in trying
to mend fences.
   ``It doesn't mean the suspicion is gone,'' said Rabbi David
Saperstein of the liberal Religious Action Center in Washington.
   ``He now has to figure out how to take some of the things he has
been saying and make them convincing to the Jewish community.''

<HEAD>Defense Restates Claims That FBI Approved Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A memo to former FBI Director William Webster
shows he knew as early as 1983 that Teamsters President Jackie
Presser was authorized to take part in ``illegal activities,''
Pressers' attorneys say.
   The memo to Webster was among documents filed in federal court
Wednesday by Presser's lawyers in an effort to show that Presser
had government permission to allow so-called ``ghost employees'' on
the payroll of Teamster Local 507 in Cleveland.
   Presser's lawyers claim the FBI authorized him to keep the
no-show employees, who reputedly had underworld ties, as a way of
gathering information about the mob. Presser has previously
produced the statements of two FBI agents to support his claim of
authorization.
   The government claims Presser; his lawyer, John R. Climaco of
Cleveland; and three FBI agents concocted the authorization defense
in 1985 to protectPresser from indictment.
   Presser, secretary-treasurer of Local 507, and two other union
officials, Anthony Hughes and Harold Friedman, are charged with
racketeering in the alleged $700,000 payroll padding scheme. Their
trial is set for July 12.
   In the memo to Webster, assistant FBI director Oliver Revell
recommended ``that authorization for Jackie Presser to participate
in illegal activities be elevated from the field to FBI HQ
(headquarters).''
   Memos filed Wednesday were intended to rebut a Justice
Department claim that the government did not know about the
authorization until 1985, when Climaco told department officials
about it.
   ``How can the government now claim that it first learned about
authorization on June 11, 1985, and how can it now claim that it
was concocted at or around that time when the director of the FBI
knew about it at least two years prior?'' Climaco said in court
papers with the Revell memo.
   Presser's lawyers say they are having problems obtaining
documents from the government to prepare their defense and have
asked for a hearing on their motion to dismiss the case.
   Wednesday's brief was a response to a brief filed in March by
prosecutors opposing Presser's attempts to have the case dismissed.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Offers Troops Pullout Next Month If Geneva Accord
Reached Soon</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to RECAST and CLARIFY that troop
withdrawal date was tentative, and move up that statement didn't
mention aid issue. Picks up 8th graf, `In Islamabad...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan said today they
had solved all problems blocking a settlement in the Afghan war.
Moscow said it intended to begin removing its troops from
Afghanistan next month.
   In Geneva, the U.N. mediator in the Afghanistan peace talks
indicated that major differences remain. But Pakistan's president
said an agreement was ready to be signed.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan leader Najib said
in a joint statement issued after meeting in the Soviet city of
Tashkent that the troop withdrawal would start May 15 if the Geneva
negotiations are successful ``in the shortest period.''
   The statement didn't mention of the issue of foreign aid to the
warring parties, which is seen as the main obstacle in reaching an
accord.
   After the statement was released, U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez
said in Geneva, ``There are very difficult decisions and the only
good thing _ I think that is important _ is that the political will
is obviously there to take them.'' He would not elaborate.
   The negotiating parties _ Najib's Soviet-backed government and
Pakistan, representing Afghan guerrillas _ tentatively agreed in
February that the Soviets would start removing their 115,000 troops
on May 15 if an accord were signed by March 15.
   With the passage of that deadline, the sides have tentatively
agreed that the Soviet withdrawal would begin two months after the
signing of an accord.
   The Geneva talks have been stalled since March 2 because of the
aid issue. The United States, the guerrillas' leading weapons
supplier, has called for a simultaneous cutoff in military aid.
Soviet officials contend they have every right to aid their ally,
Afghanistan, and say the issue has no place in the peace talks.
   In Islamabad, Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq was quoted
today as saying that the United States and Soviet Union had solved
that problem, ``so the Geneva accord could now be signed any time.''
   The official Pakistani News Agency quoted Zia as telling
Parliament: ``According to unofficial reports, the two superpowers
have agreed on the symmetry under which both would be able to
provide continued assistance to their respective allies in
Afghanistan.'' It did not elaborate on the ``unofficial'' reports.
   The Gorbachev-Najib statement, carried by the official news
agency Tass, did not clarify how much time the two sides would
allow for conclusion of a Geneva accord before their offer of a May
15 pullout expires.
   ``The last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been
removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved
in the settlement and favor their immediate signing,'' the
declaration said.
   It said the road was now clear for formation of a coalition
government including all political forces in Afghanistan
``including those who are currently opposed to one another.'' Many
of the rebels fighting the Afghan government have refused to join
in Najib's previous political overtures, which he calls ``national
reconciliation.''
   Pakistan has demanded that a broad-based coalition government,
including guerrilla and refugee leaders, be in place before the
Soviets leave.
   Otherwise, it says, bloody civil strife could continue and an
estimated 5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran would not
want to return.
   The Afghan guerrillas have been fighting the Kabul government
since an April 1978 revolution brought communists to power. Soviet
soldiers intervened Dec. 27, 1979.
   Gorbachev flew to Tashkent, capital of the republic of
Uzbekistan, on Wednesday. The Soviet leader's trip occurred under
unusually tight security. Even Soviet photographers were not
permitted to cover his departure or arrival.
   Uzbekistan borders Afghanistan. Tashkent is 450 miles north of
Kabul, the Afghan capital, and 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow.
Tass said Najib returned to Kabul today.
   Radio Moscow had said the two were meeting with the following in
mind: ``If no agreement is reached at the Afghan-Pakistani talks in
Geneva, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan will act in keeping with
their national interests. The political decision on the Soviet
troops' withdrawal remains unchanged.''

<HEAD>American Negotiators Reportedly Boycott Base Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. negotiators today boycotted
talks on U.S. military bases after newspapers reported a dispute
over American rights to launch combat missions without Manila's
approval, sources said.
   The two sides issued a joint statement saying U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Platt and Filipino Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus had
agreed to skip the morning session.
   But Filipino sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Philippine panel waited more than two hours for the Americans
to show up for the morning meeting before learning they were not
coming.
   Both sides attended an afternoon session.
   Talks began Tuesday on the status of a 1947 agreement under
which the United States maintains six military installations in the
Philippines.
   The sources said the Americans were angry about news leaks
concerning sharp differences over terms for use of the
installations, including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval
base.
   Most major Manila newspapers reported that during Wednesday's
talks, Manglapus asked for changes in the agreement to require the
United States to obtain ``prior consent'' for combat operations
launched from the bases.
   The current agreement simply requires ``prior consultations.''
According to the reports, Platt said the demand would ``cripple''
U.S. ability to maneuver and maintain its worldwide security
network.
   Platt reportedly said the demand indicated the Filipinos did not
trust the United States.
   U.S. officials refused comment on the news reports. But Filipino
sources close to the talks said the reports were accurate.
   Before the talks began, Manglapus had said Filipino negotiators
would seek changes in the agreement to strengthen Philippine
sovereignty and serve the national interest.
   He has also called for increases in the $180 million annual fee
that Washington pays for use of the installations.
   Manglapus has said $1.2 billion a year would be ``reasonable.''
   The talks, expected to last three months, coincide with a
growing public demand to close the bases. Many Filipinos see them
as a vestige of American colonial rule.
   Under the new constitution, any extension of the base agreement
beyond 1991 requires approval of two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate, where anti-base sentiment is strong.
   Platt said Tuesday the bases are essential because of the
``significant Soviet presence'' in Southeast Asia.

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas said they
ambushed and killed five Soviet advisers along a strategic highway
in Cambodia, according to a radio report made available today.
   The clandestine radio of the Khmer Rouge army said the
guerrillas ambushed a Vietnamese vehicle March 29 traveling between
the capital, Phnom Penh, and the seaport of Kompong Som.
   The broadcast said 10 people in the vehicle were killed and 12
were wounded. Among the dead, the broadcast said, were five Soviet
advisers.
   The Khmer Rouge periodically claim to kill Soviet personnel
advising the Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia. Most of the
reports cannot be confirmed by independent sources.
   The guerrillas are among three major groups fighting the
Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1978. The Soviets have a
sizable mission in Cambodia, which includes advisers in both
military and non-military fields.

<TEXT>
   Genetic tests at a British university
failed to shed any new light on whether Gary Dotson committed a
rape that his accuser later said never happened, Gov. James R.
Thompson said today.
   Dr. Alec Jeffreys, the scientist who conducted the tests, said
the evidence ``was too degraded for analysis'' with the
sophisticated genetic test, the governor said in a written
statement.
   Jeffreys suggested that an alternative test might be able to
analyze the evidence, and Thompson said he would consider that
recommendation.
   The test focused on an article of clothing worn by Cathleen
Crowell Webb at the time Dotson allegedly attacked her.
   Dotson was freed from prison in 1985 after serving six years
when Mrs. Webb recanted the testimony she gave at his trial.
   Earlier this week, Thompson received the results of a
sophisticated genetic test used to compare Mrs. Webb's
semen-stained panties with a semen specimen from Dotson.
   The test was prepared by Jeffreys, a professor at the University
of Leicester, England.
   The test analyzes DNA, genetic building blocks unique to each
person. The test has several drawbacks, including the possiblity of
an inconclusive finding because of the age of the evidence.
   Thompson commuted Dotson's 25- to 50-year sentence to the six
years Dotson had already served after three days of televised
hearings in May of 1985 before the Illinois Prisoner Review Board.
   Dotson, 30, has had brushes with the law since his 1985 release
and says he is an alcoholic. He has been arrested more than a
half-dozen times for violent incidents and traffic violations.
   He is being held without bond in the Joliet Correctional Center
on a parole violation. Under the good-behavior terms of his
``last-chance'' release, Dotson could be forced to serve out the
sentence imposed in the rape case.

<TEXT>
   Retired judge Judge Arlin M. Adams today
denied a published report that said Attorney General Edwin Meese
III spoke to him about retiring and said he wanted Adams to be his
successor as the nation's chief law officer.
   Adams, who declined an offer Monday to become chief deputy
attorney general of the U.S. Justice Department, said his remarks
in an interview in Allentown about Meese leaving office were
misinterpreted.
   Adams took issue with a story in today's editions of The Morning
Call. According to the article, Adams said Meese told him it was
the White House plan to have Adams named to succeed Meese if Meese
would have to step down.
   ``That is not correct,'' Adams said. ``I can tell you
unequivocally there was never such a discussion...it's a very
serious mistake.''
   Adams said instead he discussed stepping in for Meese when the
attorney general was out of the country.
   Morning Call City Editor David Erdman said the newspaper story
was correct.
   ``The version as we reported is what we'll stand by,'' he said.
   The Philadelphia attorney, here visiting Muhlenberg College to
lecture on the Constitution, discussed his interview with Meese
during a meeting with college officials and guests at a reception
Wednesday, the newspaper said.
   Adams, who was considered for appointment as Meese's chief
deputy last week, declined the appointment because of reluctance to
interrupt his law practice and leave his family for an indefinite
period.
   Two ranking Meese aides resigned out of concern that an
11-month-old criminal investigation of Meese was hurting the
Justice Department's operations and image. A third top Justice
Department official left to take a judgeship.
   On Tuesday, Meese recommended John C. Shepherd, a former
president of the American Bar Association, for the number-two job
at the Justice Department.
   According to the Morning Call, Adams said the attorney general
mentioned the possibility that he would leave the post several
times. He said he wanted to make sure he fully understood Meese's
plan.
   ```Well, if you have to leave, you would want me to become the
attorney general. Is that correct?''' Adams said he inquired.
Meese, he said, replied affirmatively, according to the original
story.
   When asked whether President Reagan would concur, he said Meese
replied: ``I have talked to the president, and that is his wish,
also.''
   ``I told Mr. Meese that I would do anything that I could to
help,'' Adams said. ``I would be available for counsel and I did
give him my advice. But I declined the job offer, and I have no
second thoughts.''
   Adams said he does not think much will be accomplished at the
Justice Department while Meese is still there.
   ``I don't think that he is going to leave, and I don't think
that the president is going to remove him. Ronald Reagan is very
loyal to his friends,'' Adams said.
   When asked whether he thought Meese would be indicted for his
conduct, Adams responded: ``It is very unlikely that he will be
indicted. I don't think that there is sufficient evidence against
him to support an indictment.''
   Although he is not privy to details of the investigation, Adams
emphasized that an 11-month review by special prosecutor James C.
McKay has not produced anything against Meese that would warrant
prosecution of the attorney general.
   The 66-year-old Adams, who recently retired from the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, could not be reached for comment by The
Associated Press early today because a woman who answered the phone
at his house refused to wake him.

   Zimbabwe's justice minister said
Thursday his car was stolen while he was attending a conference on
crime.
   Emmerson Munangagwa, minister for justice, legal and
parliamentary affairs, disclosed the theft in a speech at the
closing session of a two-day conference on bribery, corruption,
fraud and theft.
   He told the 200 delegates, including jurists and police
officers, that the automobile was stolen on Tuesday, the first day
of the meeting.
   The minister gave no further details, but he urged police to
work harder to bring car thieves to justice.

   Workers are using a new method involving
clay mixed with solvents to clean the stained marble of the Taj
Mahal, the world's greatest monument to love.
   The ``clay pack technique'' is used to remove stains and
yellowing caused by pollution and fumes from an oil refinery 28
miles northwest of the landmark.
   The 17th century all-marble monument at Agra, 111 miles south of
New Delhi, was built by the Moghal emperor Shahjahan in memory of
his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
   L.P. Sahi, minister of state for culture and education, told
Parliament that the clay packs had been used on a few areas of the
Taj on an experimental basis. He said the treatment had proved to
be satisfactory and would be extended to clean large surfaces.
   In the method, inert clay and non-toxic detergents are spread on
the marble. The yellowing film on the marble is absorbed by the
clay after being washed away by the detergents, Sahi said.

   Sen. Paul Simon put his faltering Democratic
presidential bid on hold today and said ``I have no illusions that
the nomination will come my way,'' but he kept a lock on his
delegates in hopes he can wield influence at the July nominating
convention.
   ``In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows
what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' Simon
said at a Washington news conference.
   Simon said he would make a final decision on his candidacy after
the last primaries on June 7. In the meantime, he said he will
devote his time to his duties as an Illinois senator.
   He said by holding onto his delegates until the convention, he
hoped to have some influence over who the party nominates. ``I want
to make sure this country does what it ought to do,'' he told
reporters.
   He attributed his campaign's stall to his own failure to
effectively communicate his message of traditional Democratic
philosophy and advocacy of a legitimate role for government in
bringing about social reforms. The campaign also was hampered by a
lack of money, he said, but added he will finish with only about
$400,000 in debts.
   Simon's quasi-withdrawal leaves just three Democrats in the
race. His decision comes after months of poor showings; he won only
his home-state primary.
   During his travels around the nation, Simon said he found
``there really is a yearning across this good land for leadership
that appeals to the noble in us, rather than the greed in us.''
   ``Government is not the enemy,'' he said. ``Government is simply
a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely. ... We can do better,
my friends.''
   He said problems like the arms race, unemployment, crime and
inadequacies in health care and education ``are not the result of
acts of God, but the result of insensitive leadership, chosen by a
people who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they might
be.''
   In the statement, Simon minimized chances that he might seek the
presidency again in 1992. ``Running for president is a little like
taking an ice-cold shower,'' he said. ``It is a great one-time
experience, but I have no yearning for a repeat performance.''
   Simon, according to an aide, hoped to pick up additional
delegates as an inactive candidate between now and the convention.
   His decision ``reflects the reality of having lost a great many
primaries and caucuses,'' said spokesman Terry Michael. ``It will
give those who supported Paul Simon (a chance) to have full
representation at the convention.''
   Simon's mother, Ruth, said Wednesday her son would remain an
official candidate, although suspending his campaign, because ``too
many people have advised him to stay in.''
   ``He's going to hang in there till the end,'' she said.
   Mrs. Simon said the senator and his family would take a week's
vacation.
   Simon, who entered the race a year ago promising a return to
``leadership rooted in the traditional values of our party,'' was
unable to put together a winning campaign formula.
   He had a brief rendezvous with momentum prior to Iowa's
first-in-the-nation February caucuses, emerging on top in several
polls of Iowa voters taken late in 1987, but things began to cool
off after Gary Hart re-entered the race in mid-December.
   When Feb. 8 arrived, Simon finished a close second in Iowa
behind Missouri congressman Richard Gephardt. A week later, he came
in third in New Hampshire behind Michael Dukakis and Gephardt.
   It was mostly downhill from there.
   He placed third or worse in most primaries and caucuses and sat
out the Super Tuesday contests in 20 states. He has garnered 170.5
delegates, compared with Dukakis' 740.55, Jesse Jackson's 704.55
and Albert Gore's 394.8.
   He did win last month's primary in his home state of Illinois,
but was unable to build on that victory and claim the Midwest as
Simon country, making poor showings in Michigan, Wisconsin and
elsewhere in the region.
   Simon, 59, is known for his trademark bow tie and liberal views.
But on the campaign trail he portrayed himself as a
``make-no-apologies Democratic nominee ... waging a fight for the
heart and the soul of the Democratic party.''
   ``I want a government that cares. I want a government that is
responsive to the needs of the less fortunate,'' he told voters.
   He painted himself the modern equivalent of plain-talking Harry
Truman, saying people are ``ready for something other than the
slick, packaged product. We're ready for somebody who's going to
level with us.''
   He proposed long-term health care for the elderly, a public
works program for the unemployed and new education initiatives, and
promised that as president he would balance the budget in three
years.
   That brought criticism from Democratic rivals who claimed Simon
was short on details when it came to explaining how he would
simultaneously finance expensive new programs and balance the
budget.
   Gephardt in one debate said ``Simonomics is really Reaganomics
with a bow tie.'' He called Simon a ``promise-as-you-go Democrat.''
   Simon, a first-term senator and four-time congressman, countered
such criticisms by claiming that too many Democrats ``have bought
into the Republican mindset, which claims we can't afford to invest
in America's future.''

   Mozaffar Firouz, a former Iranian vice premier who
was known as the ``Red Prince'' for his close ties with the Tudeh
Communist party, has died at the age of 83.
   Members of his family who announced the news Thrsday did not say
when he died or give the cause of death.
   Firouz took part in negotations in 1946 on the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from the Iranian part of Azerbaijan in the aftermath
of World War II. He also held the labor ministry portfolio and
helped draw up Iran's first labor code.
   He eventually was named ambassador to the Soviet Union but
resigned the post in 1947 to protest what he called undemocratic
policies of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   He moved to Paris and published articles and books attacking the
shah, but did not return to Iran when the shah was overthrown in
1979 in an Islamic revolution.

   Gerald Boag wiped out his mother's savings
of more than $100,000 while acting as her conservator and guardian,
attorneys agreed as his grand theft trial opened.
   The jury must decide whether Boag spent the money out of greed,
or to improve the estate by investing it to generate income.
   ``The evidence will show you a tragedy because the money's
gone,'' Latah County Public Defender Joan Fisher said Wednesday.
``But it wasn't wasted with the intent to steal.''
   Prosecutor Craig Mosman disagreed, citing the case as a failure
of the conservatorship system. ``This system served only the
defendant's greed,'' Mosman said.
   Boag, 50, is charged with pilfering more than $100,000 from the
accounts of Violet Boag, 78, who is in the Latah Care Center
suffering from symptoms related to Alzheimer's Disease.
   Mosman said Boag bought a logging truck, three pickup trucks, a
car, two satellite dishes, five horses, a mobile home, beer, ice
cream, and eyeglasses for himself, family and friends.
   But Fisher argued that Boag never meant harm to come to his
mother, and was trying to make the estate generate revenue. Boag
also was acting under the advice of an attorney, and believed he
had the power to spend the money as he wished, she added.
   Mrs. Boag was placed in the care center shortly after her
husband's death in 1986. A daughter died in 1985, and her son,
Gerald Boag, was made her conservator and guardian.

<HEAD>Group Plans to Breed Alligators in Spain for Meat & Skin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Danish group plans to set up
Europe's first alligator farm in southern Spain to produce skins
and meat for export, the project organizer said Thursday.
   ``The baby alligators would come from the United States and be
bred at the farm in Spain, but it would take three to four years
before production and export of the reptiles' skin and meat could
begin,'' said Leif Skovgaard in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   Skovgaard, a chartered accountant who is organizing the project
for a group of seven Danish investors, said 10,000-12,000
alligators would be bred yearly at a farm near the town of San
Roque.
   European Alligator Institue, as the project is called, seeks
financial support from the local and state governments in Spain as
well as the European Economic Community.
   The farm, which the group hopes to open by the beginning of
1989, would employ about 100 people, Skovgaard said.
   ``As alligators are dangerous at any age, our personnel will be
specially trained to cope with them so they don't lose fingers,''
he added.
   The project envisions a nature park where visitors can observe
the 9- to 15-foot-long animals in an outdoor environment.
   Skovgaard said he did not anticipate protests from animal
protection or environmentalist groups.
   The group contemplates inviting a representative of the World
Wildlife Fund to sit on the new company's board of directors, he
said.
   The United States banned hunting alligators because the species
was disappearing, but it was lifted recently after the animals made
a comeback.

   Nine spelunkers were found safe and
sound Thursday after being stranded for four days inside a huge
cave that was threatened by rain-swollen underground rivers, a
rescue official said.
   Rescuers emerged from the cave with seven of the cave explorers
just before 7 a.m., said Joaquin Isla, a government Civil Defense
spokesman.
   Two other men decided to continue their trek through the
18-mile-long cave known as Cueto-Coventosa, Spain's second-largest
and a favorite of national and international spelunkers, he said.
   ``Everything went fine until we ran into the swollen waters of a
lake on our way towards the Coventosa exit,'' one of the men
rescued told Spanish National Radio shortly after emerging from the
cave.
   Isla said doctors declared the seven men who emerged from the
cave in good condition, but advised them to eat and get some sleep.
He said the men had been near to using up their food supplies.
   More than 100 cave explorers took part in the search that began
Monday when explorers, who were aged between 18 and 30, failed to
emerge as planned after entering the cave Friday.
   The cave is on the outskirts of Arredondo, 23 miles east of the
northern port of Santander.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Edward P. Boland, author of the
amendments which barred U.S. aid to the Contras in Nicaragua,
announced today that he will retire after 36 years in Congress.
   ``I've decided to call it a day,'' the 76-year-old Democrfat
said at a news conference at Our Lady of Hope School, surrounded by
supporters in the Irish neighborhood where he was born and raised.
   ``The parades are all over. The give and take of the campaign
trail no longer beckons and the time has come when the bell tolls
on a career that has been for me an exhilarating and fulfilling
experience,'' he said.
   Speculation that he might retire led three Democrats _
Springfield Mayor Richard Neal, former Mayor Theodore Dimauro and
state Rep. Kenneth M. Lemanski of Chicopee _ to announce they were
interested in the seat, provided they didn't have to oppose the
incumbent in a primary.
   Boland did not endorse anyone to succeed him.
   The Reagan administration's frustration with the Boland
Amendments inspired the diverion of profits from arms sales to
support the Contras. That operation became a focus of the
Iran-Contra investigation and the recent indictment of former
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North and others.
   The reserved Boland came to Washington with the man who would
later become the speaker of the House, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill,
in 1952. For more than 20 years, the two friends roomed together in
an arrangement they described as a real-life ``Odd Couple'' with
Boland, the neat and tidy half of the pair.
   Many expected him to follow O'Neill into retirement in 1986, but
some believed that Boland stayed, in part, in the hopes of taking
over the chairmanship of the House Appropriations Committee.
   Boland is the No. 2 Democrat on the powerful panel and would be
in line for the chairmanship if Jamie L. Whitten of Mississippi
retired. Whitten, who is a year older than Boland, has already
announced plans to run for re-election.
   The son of Irish immigrants who settled in Springfield's Hungry
Hill district, Boland was elected to the Massachusetts House of
Representatives at age 22 and never lost an election in a
half-century in politics.
   Boland served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee
from 1977 to 1985.
   He remained a bachelor until 1973, when he married Mary Egan,
then the 35-year-old president of the Springfield City Council.
They have four children.

   Leaders of Afghanistan's fractious
Moslem guerrillas are forming their own regime to challenge the
communist government from ``liberated'' areas when Soviet military
forces are gone.
   The alliance of seven parties, three moderate and four
fundamentalist, has been meeting almost daily to preserve unity
while they lay the groundwork for their own government. ``There is
hope that it will work,'' a moderate leader said.
   ``No doubt, when the Russians leave Afghanistan, Najib's regime
will collapse,'' said Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the alliance.
``To avoid anarchy and possible armed clashes to seize power, it's
necessary that all parties agree to a temporary government.''
   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 soldiers now are helping fight the insurgency,
which began after a Communist coup in April 1978.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan leader Najib issued a joint
statement Thursday saying all obstacles had been cleared in
negotiations to end the war and the Soviets hope to start pulling
their troops out next month.
   In Geneva, the U.N. mediator indicated major differences remain
but Pakistan, where 3.5 million Afghan refugees have taken refuge,
said an agreement was ready for signing.
   The guerrilla alliance has agreed to hold elections among
fighters in Afghanistan and refugees in Pakistan for a council that
would vote on establishing of an interim Moslem government.
   Leaders of the seven groups have named Ahmad Shah as president
and Zabihullah Mojaddedi as his deputy to lead a 21-member Cabinet,
in which each party is to have at least two members.
   A leadership council of the seven guerrilla leaders would
function as the head of state and supervise Ahmad Shah's
government, which would operate from a ``defended'' area beyond the
reach of the Communist government's forces.
   Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, leader of the moderate Harkat Islami
Party, named five guerrilla-controlled areas: Kunar, Noorestan,
Pakitia, Panjshir and Hazarejat.
   Sebghatullah Mojaddedi, leader of the moderate Afghan National
Liberation Front, said: ``If we come under pressure in one place,
we will move to another.''
   Agreement also has been reached on having a judiciary committee
to settle disputes among the parties.
   ``We will work hard for the liberation of Afghanistank, but the
devil ... may influence some people and encourage disputes,''
Mojaddedi said.
   ``We hope our brothers will understand that, except for unity,
solidarity and compromise, there is no other way to reach our pure
goals. For the freedom of Afghanistan and in order to create true
Islam in Afghanistan, we must put aside all these disputes. There
is hope that it will work.''
   Not all rebel leaders are equally keen on forming an interim
government inside Afghanistan. Ahmad Gailani of the moderate
National Islamic Front of Afghanistan fears it could cut the nation
in half.
   ``If there are two governments in Afghanistan, there is the
danger of partition into north and south or east and west, as with
North and South Korea, or East and West Germany,'' he said.
   Gailani prefers a transitional government in exile until the
Communist regime can be overthrown.
   Yunis Khalis of the hardline Hezb-i-Islami faction expects
outside interference. ``Colonialist countries, the superpowers _
East or West, American or Russian _ have joined hands to prevent
the creation of a total Islamic government in Afghanistan,'' he
said.
   Khalis said Iran, where Shiite Moslems dominate, is urging
Shiite guerrillas to reject a Sunni Moslem government in
Afghanistan, where Sunnis are in the majority.
   ``Therefore, we cannot for certain bring about an Islamic
government in the present circumstances,'' he said. ``This is why
we declare we will not abandon our jihad (holy war).''
   Deep-seated frictions persist. One source Hekmatyar, who is
unpopular even in the hardline camp but recently replaced Khalis as
head of the alliance.
   ``He is not the leader but only head of the alliance. Every
party is independent,'' Mojaddedi said. ``Of course we have had our
complaints. The brothers have warned him that, now that he has
become the head, it does not mean he has all the authority in his
hand to do whatever he likes.''
   Hekmatyar's men have been accused of harassing guerrillas of
other parties, journalists and relief workers traveling to
Afghanistan.
   His party, also called Hezb-i-Islami, has been blamed for the
killing of a British cameraman last year. Hekmatyar has denied it.

   Sen. Paul Simon today put his presidential campaign on hold,
reducing the Democratic quartet to a trio. Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore, meanwhile, zeroed in on Mideast issues, seen as a
likely sore spot for Jesse Jackson in the upcoming New York primary.
   Simon, who has lost everywhere except in his home state of
Illinois, suspended campaign activities, but stopped short of
dropping out. He said he would make a final decision on his
candidacy after the final primary on June 7.
   ``In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows
what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' Simon
said at a Capitol Hill news conference. But he added: ``I have no
illusions that the nomination will come my way.''
   The three remaining active Democrats were all campaigning today
in New York, which holds its primary April 19. At stake are 255
delegates, in what will be the biggest state contest to date.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in an interview published today, said
he is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary. And he
warned the Democrats _ singling out Gore _ that negative
campaigning is ``terribly dangerous.''
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
today endorsed Cuomo's appeal to Gore to tone down his criticism of
rivals Dukakis and Jackson.
   ``The admonitions that have been addressed to Senator Gore by
Governor Cuomo just help to make sure we can continue to talk about
the issues in a positive way,'' Kirk said at a news conference in
Washington, D.C.
   ``All those admonitions are helpful and are on course, as far as
I'm concerned.''
   On the Republican side, there was plenty of parley: Vice
President George Bush, the nominee in all but name, met Wednesday
with former rival Sen. Bob Dole, who pledged to work to get Bush
elected. And Dole talked with Pat Robertson, who remains in the
Republican race although he concedes he has little chance of being
nominated.
   Simon said that by suspending his campaign, he will hold onto
his delegates until the convention and perhaps have some say over
the party's nominee.
   ``I want to make sure this country does what it ought to do,''
he said.
   Simon made his last stand in Wisconsin, where he finished a weak
fourth in Tuesday's primary. The Illinois senator ran second in the
leadoff Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8, in what was to be his best showing
of the campaign outside of his home state.
   After finishing third in New Hampshire a week later, he did not
have enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests on
Super Tuesday, March 8, and was consequently clobbered.
   Many expected him to drop out after that, but Simon, under
pressure from Illinois supporters, stayed in for his home-state
primary, then said his victory there was enough reason to remain in
the race.
   For the other Democrats, the battle of New York began in earnest
on Wednesday. Dukakis was at work courting voters in New York's
large Jewish community, stressing the need for a Mideast peace plan
that would allow Israel to ``live in peace and harmony.''
   Gore reiterated his strong support for Israel as he campaigned
Wednesday in New York City. He said as president, he would create a
Cabinet-level position to focus full-time on Mideast negotiations.
Gore also blasted Dukakis and Jackson for a lack of experience in
international affairs.
   Cuomo decried such infighting, saying his admonition was
directed mainly at Gore.
   ``It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous and
counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the
nominee,'' he said in an interview with The Washington Post.
   Cuomo, seen by some Democrats as a potential draftee in the
event of a deadlocked convention, said he preferred to wait until
after the primary season to make an endorsement.
   ``That's the time for leadership in this process,'' the governor
said.
   Jackson was campaigning in New York today, after spending a day
in Arizona, which holds Democratic caucuses on April 16, and
Indiana, where primary day is May 3. In Indianapolis, Jackson was
asked how he expected to do among New York's Jewish voters.
   ``You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. ``All you
can do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see people
are responding.''
   Many Jews were offended by Jackson's 1984 reference to New York
as ``Hymietown'' _ for which he apologized _ and his association
with Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan, who called Judaism a ``gutter
religion.'' Jackson no longer has ties to Farrakhan, his campaign
says.
   Jackson has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the Jewish
community.
   After three straight wins _ in Connecticut, Colorado and
Wisconsin _ Dukakis was leading in the national delegate race. The
latest AP count put him at 740.55, Jackson at 704.55, uncommitted
at 513.6, Gore at 394.8 and Simon at 170.5
   Even if he is not actively campaigning, Simon could continue to
gain delegates, and keep those he has. That would leave him in
control of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at the
Democratic National Convention.
   Whether he meant it to or not, Simon's decision to technically
remain a candidate helps Dukakis remain the leader in the delegate
race.
   Under party rules, Simon is entitled to 47 at-large delegates
from Illinois, Jackson to 13 and Dukakis none. A Simon withdrawal
would automatically shift his 47 delegates to Jackson's column, and
thus put him ahead in national delegate count.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis widened his margin of victory over Jackson in
Monday's Colorado caucuses. Returns on Tuesday showed Dukakis had
narrowly won. On Wednesday, with 85 percent of the precincts
reporting, Dukakis had widened his lead to 11 percentage points, 45
to 34 percent.

<DATELINE>QUINCY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although police don't consider her a
``cold-blooded killer,'' a woman charged with concealing the
shotgun slaying of her husband last November also is suspected of
shooting him.
   Aida Chapman, 28, was arrested Monday at a relative's home in
Rock Island, where she has lived since moving in mid-December from
the Quincy-area home she shared with her husband and two children,
said Jon McCoy, chief deputy for the Adams County Sheriff's
Department.
   Mrs. Chapman was charged with concealing the death of her
husband, Donald Chapman, 27, whose cremated remains were discovered
March 15 in woods near the Chapman's home, McCoy said.
   No charges have been filed in Chapman's slaying.
   ``We will prove that she killed her husband,'' McCoy said. ``But
there are varying degrees of homicides. Some are lawful and some
are not.
   ``This was not a murder. She is not a cold-blooded killer.''
   McCoy said there was a history of violence between the Chapmans
and that he believes the shooting occurred as Mrs. Chapman as
defended herself.
   McCoy said Mrs. Chapman reported her husband missing Dec. 3
under pressure from relatives who didn't believe her claim that
he'd run out. Chapman was unemployed at the time.
   Mrs. Chapman was released from the Rock Island County Jail after
posting $3,000 bail on the concealment charge. She waived
arraignment and a date for her preliminary hearing in Adams County
Circuit Court has not been set, McCoy said.
   If convicted of the felony, Mrs. Chapman could face two to five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

   A man was convicted of murder after the man he
assaulted nearly five years ago died.
   The jury convicted Christopher Bush, 30, of first-degree murder
Wednesday after deliberating one day in suburban Oakland County
Circuit Court. The victim, Jeffrey Dudley, 24, died last summer.
   Assistant Prosecutor John Slevin argued during trial that
Dudley's health deteriorated steadily after the 1983 attack in
which he was beaten, shot in the heart and dumped in a sewer.
   Bush is serving a prison sentence for robbery and assault.
   Because of the attack, Dudley wore a pacemaker and had undergone
surgery eight times. Doctors had testified the attack caused
permanent heart damage.
   Dudley collapsed June 28 after trying to stop a shoving match
between two players at a basketball game in Detroit. Bush's lawyer,
Otis Underwood argued the fall may have caused his death.

<TEXT>
   Global registration began Thursday for a second
Sport Aid ``Race Against Time,'' the six-mile street jog by nearly
20 million people in 1986 that raised $35 million for starving
Africans.
   Organizers are hoping to involve all 218 countries and inhabited
territories in the Sept. 11 extravaganza, compared with 89 nations
last time. Major charities and sports federations in 85 countries
have already joined the Sport Aid '88 campaign.
   ``We're trying to build on that new constituency of
compassion,'' said an organizer, Simon Dring. ``All we can do is to
create a forum for this to happen and say to the world, `Please
join us.'''
   The United States is expected to contribute more this year,
Dring said. Sport Aid was a flop in America in 1986 because it
coincided with a nationwide ``Hands Across America'' campaign to
raise funds for the poor and homeless.
   ``America is America,'' Dring said in an interview. ``It lives
within itself so adequately, it's very difficult sometimes to
involve them in events of this nature.
   ``We're presently in discussions with the American Red Cross and
with a number of major sponsors in America and we believe this year
America will run,'' he said.
   The first person to register for this year's run was Omar
Khalifa, a Sudanese athlete who dramatized the plight of Africa's
famine victims when he carried a burning charcoal ember in an
Olympic torch to 14 countries to launch the May 25, 1986, event.
   Each runner will be given an individual number tag, starting
with Khalifa's No. 1, which he donned during a news conference at
Sport Aid's headquarters in London.
   ``It will give every single individual a common sense of
identity,'' said another organizer, Chris Long.
   The race will start on Sept. 11 when a boy and a girl from each
participating country or territory runs through the streets of New
York to the steps of the United Nations to give the signal for the
worldwide series of raod races to begin.
   Money raised from sponsors of runners and from ticket sales to
the races will go to needy children in mainly undeveloped countries.
   One-fifth of the money raised in developed countries will be put
aside for disadvantaged and disabled children in those countries.
The rest will be split between the United Nations' Children's Fund
and the Red Cross.
   The events will be televised live to an audience of more than
750 million people.
   In 1986, young and old crowded the streets and sidewalks of 279
cities from London to Ouagadougou and from Brisbane to Budapest for
the global race.

<TEXT>
   It's against the law to sell beer or any
other kind of alcoholic drink in Shackelford County, but a beer
truck was welcomed Thursday.
   The Adolph Coors Co. delivered 44,000 pounds of feed grain
pellets made from malt leftovers, a brewing byproduct, for cattle
left without grass because of last month's huge range fire.
   ``I'm sure it (the truck) will turn some heads in Shackelford
County, but there's no beer in there,'' said Bob Livingston,
legislative affairs manager for Coors in Austin.
   County Extension Agent Lawrence Winkler and County Judge Marie
Smith said they didn't know how many head of cattle remained.
Winkler said the majority have been moved out to other pastures.
   The high protein feed supplement should feed the remaining
cattle for four days, Livingston said.
   Officials say the delivery was one of the largest donations to
ranchers since the fire that began March 10 burned more than
300,000 acres in five counties.
   The grain pellets were donated by a Coors division, Coors
Biotech, said Dusty Garrison of state Rep. Rick Perry's office. He
said he understood that Coors employees heard of the fire and began
making arrangements for the donation.
   But while the dry county got help from the big beer company,
beer trucks do go the county, the judge said. ``The two counties to
the east and west of us are all wet.''

<HEAD>Howitzer Joy Ride Brings Guilty Plea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A civilian accused of taking a self-propelled
howitzer for a joy ride with an Army private has pleaded guilty to
a federal misdemeanor charge in exchange for dismissal of a felony
charge.
   Roberto Torres, 26, and Pvt. Norman Clair, 19, took the tracked,
armored Army artillery piece from Fort Carson on Nov. 11 and drove
it up Interstate 25 to Denver, trailed by a parade of police cars.
When the howitzer ran out of gasoline, police arrested the men.
   Clair was sentenced earlier to 15 months in prison on military
charges.
   Torres faces a maximum of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine
as a result of his plea Wednesday to a charge of stealing personal
property valued at $200 or less. He also may be required to pay
restitution of $1,000 for minor damage to the howitzer and to
fences that were broken at Fort Carson.
   The charge dropped was stealing the artillery piece. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Fred Stephens said the 10-year sentence under that
charge was too stiff for what amounted to a joyride.
   U.S. District Judge Jim Carrigan accepted the plea bargain after
making sure Torres had chosen a different mode of transportation to
court.
   ``Yes, we came here together in my car,'' defense attorney
Robert Erler said. ``It gets better gas mileage than the vehicle he
chose for his previous trip.''
   Clair, an ammunition handler, said he got the idea of taking the
howitzer as a means of getting out of the Army after Torrez told
him he was declared schizophrenic and given an honorable discharge
and benefits after stealing a jeep in 1979.
   Torres is on a military disability pension after having been
discharged from the Army for psychiatric problems.

   Former Gov. A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler today
released a statement apologizing for a racial remark he made at a
University of Kentucky Board of Trustees meeting.
   Chandler said Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, who appointed him to a
voting position on the UK board earlier this year, called him today
and ``took me to the woodshed'' for the remark.
   Wilkinson suggested that he apologize but did not request that
he resign from the board, Chandler said.
   ``If he did, I'd resign,'' Chandler said.
   Chandler used the racial epithet Tuesday during a committee's
discussion of the university's 1985 decision to dispose of its
investments in South Africa.
   ``You know Zimbabwe's all nigger now. There aren't any whites,''
he said. About seven of the 20 board members were present.
   Chandler said today at a news conference at his home here he
stands on his record of helping blacks and other minorities
throughout his lifetime of public service as governor, U.S. senator
and commissioner of baseball.
   ``I didn't intend to be offensive to anybody,'' said Chandler.
   In an interview Wednesday with the Lexington Herald-Leader,
Chandler said students who protested the racial slur were ``trying
to make a mountain out of a molehill.''
   ``I don't think I should be censured for this,'' Chandler told
the newspaper. ``I don't think I deserve any harsh treatment.''
   The Student Government Association on Wednesday night approved a
resolution calling for Chandler's resignation from the board.
Earlier, about 40 students marched on the university's
administration building to meet with President David Roselle. Some
carried placards with slogans like ``Hopefully Happy is Sad.''
   Tae Dorham, a member of the American Association of University
Students, said the group demanded an apology from Chandler, and if
that wasn't accomplished, his resignation.
   ``Let's see how far they (students) can go,'' Chandler said in a
telephone interview from his home. ``My whole record, I think, is
good enough to overcome this.''
   Chandler, 89, was commissioner of baseball from 1945-51 and
takes credit for opening the door for Jackie Robinson to become the
first black to play major-league baseball when Robinson signed with
the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946.
   During a second term as governor, he won praise for his
endorsement of racial integration of schools.
   Roselle told the students that the ``university completely and
totally repudiates'' Chandler's statement. ``It's completely
contrary ... to what we want to have be the belief of the
University of Kentucky,'' he said.
   The university's only black trustee, Edythe Jones Hayes, said
she would ask the board to issue a statement ``to be sure the
public knows this is not representative of the feelings of the
board.''

   Two doctors say U.S.-made tear gas used by
Israel to curb Arab protests may be causing deaths and injuries to
civilians, but further studies are needed to determine the extent
of the problem.
   ``Adequate research just has not been done,'' said Dr. Howard
Hu, an epidemiologist at the Harvard University School of Public
Health.
   Hu and Dr. Jonathan Fine are associated with Physicians for
Human Rights, a Boston-based group which is concerned that the
Israelis may be misusing tear gas, a chemical agent that overcomes
its victims by causing severe irritation to the eyes, skin and
respiratory tract.
   If tear gas is handled properly, the effects are not
long-lasting, but it can kill people if it is fired in high doses
into enclosed areas.
   ``It would not surprise me if there were deaths of infants or
the infirm'' from too much exposure to tear gas in Israel, Fine
said. ``We believe it is important to do planned studies on this.''
   The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a lobbying
group, claims that more than 30 people have died in Israel and in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from exposure to tear
gas, which also has caused injuries and miscarriages.
   Yossi Gal, a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy, said those
figures are wildly inflated. The Israelis have found only one
probable death attributable to tear gas, he said.
   But the committee has asked TransTechnology Corp., a tear gas
manufacturer in Sherman Oaks, Calif., to halt shipments to Israel
until it determines the substance is being properly handled.
   Israel has bought 120,000 tear gas grenades or projectiles from
U.S. companies under the U.S. government's military sales credit
program since the Arab disturbances began in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip four months ago.
   Burl Alison, a vice president at TransTechnology, said the
company is ``redoubling'' its effort to ensure the material is
being used correctly after the committee ``presented what looked
like evidence that it is being misused.''
   Two types of tear gas _ code-named CN and CS by the U.S. Army _
are made at the company's Federal Laboratories in Saltsburg, Pa.
   ``We are writing to the prime minister (of Israel) to try to get
some attention to the proper use of the product,'' Mrs. Alison said.
   The company also has offered to send staff to train the Israeli
military on how to use the substance, but the Israeli government
has not responded, she said.
   There have been reports from Israel that tear gas was fired into
Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem in January, and a canister landed in
Ramallah Hospital in March. It has also been dropped by helicopter
into refugee camps, witnesses say.
   But Gal said it is not the government's policy to fire tear gas
into closed spaces, although some might drift into confined areas.
``It's mostly used outdoors,'' he said.
   Mrs. Alison said tear gas is a safe, effective way to control
crowds if directions are followed, and TransTechnology has no plans
to stop selling to Israel.
   ``Even if it is misused, you would see much more grief and many
more fatalities and injuries if it weren't available,'' she said.
   Each batch of tear gas sold to Israel must be licensed under the
Arms Export Control Act, which requires recipients to live up to
U.S. human rights standards. In 1985, the United States refused to
sell tear gas to Korean police because of that country's poor human
rights performance.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition he not be
named, defended the Israelis' use of tear gas, and said the U.S.
government has not investigated any reports of misuse.
   ``We think maintaining order should be in the most humane way
possible,'' the official said. ``One of those ways is tear gas.''
   Fine of the human rights group said the long-term effects of
tear gas have been ``understudied and underreported.'' He added:
``I wouldn't belittle the problem.''
   Since disturbances began in the occupied territories four months
ago, at least 138 Arabs, one Israeli soldier and one Israeli
civilian have been killed.

<TEXT>
   A woman trying to collect $100,000 from
her husband for a broken foot must divorce him if she wants to
proceed with the suit, the Third District Court of Appeal has ruled.
   Florida law prohibits spouses from suing each other, the court
ruled.
   The dilemma is part of Shoemaker vs. Shoemaker, a case in which
Aleta Shoemaker of Key West slipped and fell while trying to help
her then ex-husband, Michael, tidy up his house.
   After the May 23, 1985, injury, Michael moved into Aleta's
apartment to care for her.
   ``He had to,'' she said in her disposition. ``I couldn't help
myself. I had no one to help me.''
   A few months later, while her merchant marine husband was back
at sea, Aleta sued him. ``I felt he owed me,'' she said.
   But when Michael returned, they re-married.
   The suit hasn't soured the second marriage, Aleta said. ``He
feels responsible and he doesn't like to discuss it.''

   A man hoped to make his death look like
murder by using balloons to try to float the 1{-pound gun away,
police reports said.
   The Feb. 12 death of real estate broker Lee DeGray Gibson, 52,
was ruled a suicide. His body was found on a rock jetty on the
Arkansas River with a gunshot wound to the left side of his chest.
Police records say a pair of balloons were tied to a string which
was tied to a .32-caliber pistol found in the water.
   Sgt. Eddie Alexander said the gun would have floated away except
the string got wrapped around Gibson's hand.
   He said there was no obvious reason to make the death look like
a murder. Two life insurance policies taken out in 1985 and 1986
did not have suicide clauses in them and two-year contestability
clauses had expired.

   The chants of women recruits jogging

   Inside, Marine officers are continuing an investigation of
lesbianism, which has already led to charges against several former
drill instructors and at least one officer.
   Five women Marines have been charged with various counts
including committing indecent acts. Two other women who were due to
go before administrative hearing boards are seeking discharges.
   Each year, 20,000 recruits graduate from the 11-week basic
training program at Parris Island. One of the four recruit
battalions is made up of women and Parris Island is the only base
that provides basic training for the 10,060 women in the Corps.
   At least 10 women are under investigation and the probe by the
Naval Investigative Service is likely to expand, according to a
Marine who said she's a target and who has leaked word of the
investigation in letters to a number of news organizations.
   ``Every base I've been on has had one of these so-called witch
hunts,'' said the woman.
   ``One of the reasons I went to the press is to show there's an
injustice being done,'' said the woman, who spoke on the condition
her name not be used. ``If they're going to conduct these
investigations they need to do it on the male side of the house as
well.''
   The woman denies she is homosexual and has not been formally
charged.
   During the last three federal fiscal years, 90 women and 219 men
have been dismissed for homosexuality, according to the Department
of Defense. More than 40 percent of those discharged were women,
who represent only about 5 percent of the Corps' strength.
   Department of Defense figures also show that, during the
three-year period, 662 cases of homosexuality among Marines were
investigated by the Naval Investigative Services and about a third
of the investigations involved women.
   There's no clear reason for the disparity and the matter has
never been studied, said Corps spokeswoman Joanne Schilling in
Washington. She denied that special attention was being paid to
lesbians.
   ``A commanding officer has the responsibility if someone in
their command has indicated a reason to believe there's a violation
of the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice) to check it out,''
she said.
   The investigation at Parris Island ``is not a regular occurrence
but it's not an unprecedented thing,'' said Maj. Robert McLean, a
spokesman for the base.
   Records of such cases are kept only about two years, but McLean
said he understood that there was a similar hearing involving women
Marines three or four years ago.
   He said the base doesn't make unsolicited announcements of such
hearings but will answer media inquiries.
   The current proceedings are Article 32 hearings, which are
similar to civilian grand jury hearings. They are, in effect, an
open investigation in which defendants have certain rights and
defense and prosecution witnesses can be called.
   The investigating officer then makes a non-binding
recommendation to the Marine's commanding officer. The
recommendation may be that the charges go to a court-martial, that
the Marine go before an administrative discharge board or the
charges be dismissed.
   In an administrative discharge board, a board of Marines
determines whether the defendant has the potential for further
service. A court-martial could lead to a prison sentence.
   In addition to the counts of indecent acts, the defendants face
various charges including dereliction of duty, sodomy, conspiracy
to obstruct justice and assault.
   ``Not all the charges are related to homosexuality,'' McLean
said. ``In a larger sense, we are talking about breaches of good
order and discipline.''
   He said the Corps cannot tolerate homosexuality because
``homosexuality is contrary to good order and discipline, not
because there is a statement being made about lifestyles.
   ``Recruit training must be conducted with the highest standards
of order and discipline,'' he added. ``The overwhelming majority of
those who serve perform faultlessly.''

   The Christian Science Monitor announced Thursday
it is launching a nightly half-hour news program, ``Monitor
Newsworld,'' in September.
   The show will originate from Boston with satellite linkups to
international bureaus. Former NBC correspondent John Hart will
anchor. Commentator Hodding Carter, a former spokesman for the U.S.
State Department, will be the program's special Washington
correspondent.
   The Christian Science Monitor already has a syndicated TV news
analysis show, ``The Christian Science Monitor Reports,'' and a
radio show.
   No distribution agreement has been reached for the new show, but
it will either by syndicated or on a national cable network, the
Monitor said in a statement.
   When Hart announced three weeks ago that he was leaving NBC
after 13 years, he insisted he had no plans. He said Thursday he
decided to join the new Monitor show because of a ``coherence of
purpose _ to give a balanced account of human life.''
   On Wednesday, USA Today officially unveiled plans for its
nightly television news show, ``USA Today: The Television Show,''
which will also premiere in September. That show will be syndicated
and has been sold in more than 100 markets.

   Reconstruction has been stopped at the
Federal Detention Center, which was heavily damaged by rioting
Cuban detainees last November, while the Bureau of Prisons waits
for Congress to reallocate funds to finish the job.
   The bureau's administrative division issued a temporary work
stoppage order a week after workers began rebuilding the $17
million facility.
   ``We're waiting for Congress to reprogram the money to go ahead
with reconstruction,'' said Kathy Morse, a bureau spokeswoman in
Washington, D.C. ``We've got the money, but it has not been
appropriated to use for this purpose.''
   She said no problem was anticipated in securing the approval.
   BOP is trying to transfer funds from other projects to rebuild
both the Oakdale center and Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, she said
Wednesady.
   Cuban detainees, protesting possible deportation, rioted and
burned the two facilities late last year.
   Contracts were signed March 25 to rebuild the Oakdale center,
and BOP issued an order for work to begin March 28.
   The burned-out shells of 10 of the Oakdale detention center's 14
buildings have been demolished and are expected to be rebuilt. The
four other buildings, all dormitories, are being renovated.
   Oakdale city officials have predicted the rebuilding will employ
about 300 people in an area with 14.1 percent unemployment.
   More than 200 people were waiting to apply for construction jobs
the morning the Oakdale office of the Louisiana Job Service began
accepting applications.

<HEAD>Nine-Month-Old Recipient Of Multi-Organ Transplant To Leave
Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two months after being given a new liver, small
bowel, pancreas and a portion of stomach, 9-month-old Michael
Steward is ready to go home, his doctor says.
   The success of the transplant operation so far is ``absolutely
fantastic news'' that provides hope for other children suffering
from multiorgan failure, Dr. James Williams says.
   The boy, who is from Rockford, underwent a multiorgan transplant
operation at Chicago's Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center
in February.
   Michael, the youngest child to receive such a transplant, is
scheduled to be released from the hospital Saturday, Williams said
Wednesday.
   Only three other children are known to have had such
transplants. Two have died; the third still is hospitalized.
   Michael was born with a twisted intestine that turned gangrenous
and had to be removed a week later. That left him with an intestine
too small to absorb food. Intravenous feeding kept him alive but
destroyed his liver, necessitating the transplants.
   After the transplant surgery, Michael battled setbacks,
including holes in the donor small bowel, Williams said.
   ``There have been a couple of times in this course that I didn't
think he was going to survive,'' Williams said.
   He said it was possible the boy will be able to function
normally.
   ``I'm very encouraged by the progress that has been made so far,
but it's still an experiment and we're still in the middle of it,''
Williams said.
   Williams said the donor bowel has been maturing well and the
child now gets about two-thirds of his nutrition through it. He
gets the rest of his nourishment through intravenous feeding.
   The doctor said he expects the boy will be weaned entirely from
intravenous feeding within two weeks.
   The donor small intestine has not yet been connected to the
boy's stomach, so he will have to return to the hospital in about
two months to undergo an operation to connect it, Williams said.
   ``We can't say that we have the total solution to short gut
syndrome in children, but we are strongly encouraged that this
procedure can be a promising option for other children suffering
from similar problems,'' he said.

   Officials of the Knights of Malta cast secret
ballots Friday for a new leader to carry on the Roman Catholic
order's 900-year-old tradition of chivalry, charity and nobility.
   Thirty-six electors will lock themselves in a villa on the
Aventine Hill on Friday to vote for a successor to Fra Angelo de
Mojana di Cologna. The order's grand master died Jan. 18 at the age
of 82 after 25 years as the knights' supreme leader.
   The 78th grand master will be chosen from among 22 of the
electors, including de Mojana's interim replacement, Fra Giancarlo
Pallavicini, a Hungarian-born American biochemist.
   A grand master carries the title of prince and is addressed as
``Your Most Eminent Highness.'' Equal in rank to a cardinal, he is
elected for life and is considered the highest-ranking layman in
the Roman Catholic church.
   To be eligible for the position, he must have attained the top
rank of ``Knight of Justice'' and followed vows of poverty,
chastity and obedience. He also must be able to prove 200 years of
nobility on the side of both parents.
   The result of the election will be announced only after the
decision is ratified by Pope John Paul II, possibly several days
after the vote.
   The Sovereign Military Order of the Hospital of St. John of
Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta _ the group's full title _ was
founded during the crusades when it opened a hospice for pilgrims
in Jerusalem in the early 11th century.
   It has the status of an independent state and has diplomatic
relations with 50 nations.
   The order is not related to the Knights of Columbus, an American
Roman Catholic society for men founded in 1882 in New Haven, Conn.,
that also is involved in charity and social works.
   The Knights of Malta dedicate themselves to chivalry, charity
and nobility. Today the order has about 10,000 members, led by
Italy with 2,800 and followed closely by the United States with
2,500, said spokesman Monsignor Antonio Jannone said.
   Among its well-known members in the United States are New York
financier J. Peter Grace, attorney Edward Bennett Williams, former
Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the late CIA director William
Casey. Italian members include Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti,
President Francesco Cossiga and Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli.
   Beyond the image of chivalry, pomp and noblesse oblige _
symbolized by their uniforms, cloaks, medals, plumed hats and
swords _ the knights are known for their dedication to the sick and
wounded.
   The order operates about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in
90 countries, especially in Third World nations and war zones.
   ``After centuries of fighting to protect our citizens and
territory, the order has returned to its original function: health
assistance, hospitals, fighting against hunger and misery,''
Jannone said in an interview.
   For centuries, membership in the order required proof of ``blue
blood,'' but some ranks including ``Knights and Dames of Grace and
Devotion'' are now accessible to those without noble ancestry.
About 60 percent of the order's members today do not come from
nobility, Jannone said.
   Since 1834 the order has been based in Rome, where it owns a
16th century palace on Via Condotti in the heart of the shopping
district and a four-acre villa on the Aventine Hill. The site is a
favorite spot for Romans and tourists, who can peek through a gate
keyhole down a cypress-lined path that frames the dome of St.
Peter's Basilica in the distance.
   The order took on its military-chivalric character to defend
pilgrims and the Christian kingdom against Moslem attacks. The
knights were forced out of the Holy Land at the end of the 13th
century, eventually settling in Rhodes, where they became a naval
power in the eastern Mediterranean.
   They were driven from Rhodes by the Ottoman Turks in the 16th
century and moved to Malta, which they turned into an island
fortress and a thriving center of Christianity and trade.
   The knights stayed in Malta until 1798, when the island was
captured by French Emperor Napoleon. Before settling in Rome, the
order temporarily came under control of Czar Paul I of Russia and
shuttled among St. Petersburg, Catania and Ferrara.
   Among their activities in the United States, the Knights of
Malta run free clinics at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles and
Providence Hospital in Oakland, Calif., and a family dispensary in
East Los Angeles. They also give financial aid to Fordham
University in New York, the Pearson Foundation and Project Hope.
   In recent years the order has been waging a legal battle against
some 22 groups in the United States that use similar names and
titles and demand high fees and contributions. The real knights say
they collect minimal dues but that members are expected to
contribute generously to the order's projects.
   The order has filed suits in U.S. courts against the ``false
groups,'' but all the cases have apparently been dropped, Jannone
said.

<TEXT>
   A 11 year-old boy suspended from
school for refusing to tame his Mohawk haircut blamed school
officials Thursday for blowing the issue out of proportion.
   ``None of the kids make fun of me,'' said Matt Youngs, a
sixth-grader at Sackets Harbor Central School. ``A lot of them like
it and want one.''
   ``It's the teachers that don't like it,'' he said.
   William and Clifta Youngs don't like their son's haircut, but
they're willing to go to court to defend his right to keep it.
   School officials in this small town on Lake Ontario believe
Matt's haircut is disrupting classes. He was suspended for five
days this week after his parents refused to promise that he would
change it.
   Superintendent Alson B. Dougherty said he considers Matt's
haircut to be as disruptive as ``extremely short shorts'' or
``see-through blouses.''
   ``More time is spent talking about the hairdo than working on
the things they (students) should be working on,'' Dougherty said.
``We want a safe, predictable environment in the classroom.''
   ``I think what I'm doing is right,'' Matt said. ``I can wear my
hair any way I want. This is America.''
   Matt, reached at home Thursday, said that about three months ago
he and three buddies asked their parents to give them Mohawk
haircuts. Matt's mom did his.
   ``It's brush-cut on top, long in the back and shaved on the
sides,'' he said.
   The boys' parents received letters March 16 from Principal
Robert B. Wagoner Jr. saying their sons would be suspended if they
didn't change the styles. All but Matt's parents complied.
   ``Teachers do not want to take his class to assembly programs,
have guest speakers come in or go on field trips,'' Wagoner's
letter said. ``They are saying they would rather forego the
embarrassment to themselves and the school.''
   Under New York Department of Education regulations, principals
or superintendents have the authority to intervene in disruptive
manners of dress, said Elena Zongrone, a staff member with the
Educational Planning Department in Albany. Parents can appeal the
decision, which may ultimately be decided by the courts.
   School district attorney Lee Willbanks said the district would
decide by Monday whether to impose another suspension or possibly
expel Matt.
   Mrs. Youngs said she only requires that Matt wash his hair daily
and keep it neat.
   ``It's clean, it's neat, it's short,'' said Mrs. Youngs. ``I
don't feel there's anything wrong with it. If he wants it, he can
keep it.''

   Lester Maddox says he has a right to sell
his property for use as a tire store if he wants to, no matter what
his neighbors think.
   The former Georgia governor is to appear April 19 before the
Cobb County Board of Commissioners in an effort to have his
1.24-acre lot rezoned for sale to Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.,
which wants it for a store and car care center.
   But some neighbors in Maddox's densely developed neighborhood
south of Marietta and north of Atlanta don't like the idea.
   ``An automotive business is a noisy, disruptive type
establishment that doesn't belong in a residential neighborhood,''
said resident David Hong.
   Commercial development has boomed in the area around Maddox's
house in the 11 years that he and his wife, Virginia, have lived
there. Maddox said he wants to sell out because he is fed up with
congestion and traffic.

   Country humorist Jerry Clower's
popularity is costing his hometown money and leaving passing
motorists with no direction.
   Six bare sign poles along Jerry Clower Boulevard attest to the
drawing power of the comic's name. Two years ago, Yazoo City named
the part of U.S. 49 in honor of Clower, ``The Mouth of the South.''
   Clower and Mayor Charles Fulgham theorize that out-of-towners
must have stolen the signs while passing through. But the
investigation, begun in January when the absence of some of the
signs was noticed, has hit only dead ends.
   ``I don't know who did it,'' Clower said recently. ``But it was
some good ol' boy passing through, I assume, and he was on his way
to Ohio and he thinks, `I'll hang this up in my house.'''
   Fulgham said the signs cost $40 apiece. The city only has nine
signs left out of the original 15 ``and we're keeping an eye on
them,'' the mayor said Thursday.
   City officials are offering a $200 reward for information
leading to the whereabouts of the signs, along with the arrest and
conviction of the souvenir seekers.

   Two juveniles convicted of
trespassing at the Malibu home of actor Sean Penn and rock star
Madonna have been sentenced, but authorities are keeping mum about
the outcome.
   Penn and Madonna confronted three men when they returned home
shortly after midnight on Jan. 20, officials said. Penn subdued one
intruder after a struggle by hitting him on the head with a bottle
of salad dressing.
   Richard Barcelo, 20, of Chino, has pleaded innocent to
misdemeanor charges of prowling and assault. But the two juveniles,
who faced sentences ranging from confinement at the state youth
authority to probation, were never identified.
   Prosecutors refused to discuss the case after Wednesday's
sentencing, citing state law involving juveniles. ``They were
disposed of,'' said Andy Reynolds, a spokesman for the district
attorney's office.

   White House chief of staff Howard
Baker said today that President Reagan's arrangement for leasing a
$2.5 million Bel Air estate was ``beyond legitimate criticism'' and
that the first family ``may not like'' all the publicity about the
deal.
   The White House refused to say how much Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, will pay for the posh home where they will move when he
leaves office. Real estate sources, however, estimate the
fair-market value at $12,000 to $15,000 a month.
   Without providing any figures, the White House said the Reagans
will pay a fair-market rental.
   Baker, talking with reporters at the seaside hotel where he is
staying during Reagan's vacation, was asked if there was any
appearance of impropriety in the leasing deal.
   ``I don't think so,'' he replied.
   ``The White House, the president and the first lady went to
great lengths to make sure that this was an arms-length
transaction, that there was a full appraisal of the rental price of
this property and that all of the i's were dotted and the t's were
crossed, and the president and the first lady have handled this in
precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism of
the transaction,'' Baker said.
   Asked if the Reagans were upset by publicity about the house, he
said, ``Oh, I don't think so. I think after eight years they've
come to understand that that occurs, and while they understand it,
they may not like it, but they are not angry about it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to say how much
the Reagans would pay under a three-year lease that took effect
March 1.
   ``There is no federal requirement to divulge the amount of the
lease rental,'' Fitzwater said Wednesday.
   Stephen Shapiro of the Los Angeles realty firm of Stan Herman &
Associates said the fair market value for a 6,500 square-foot home
in that neighborhood would be $15,000 a month. Realtor Jeff Hyland,
who lives in the neighborhood, estimated the cost at $12,000 a
month.
   The single-story, ranch-style home, with three bedrooms, six
baths and a heated swimming pool, is situated on 1\ acres in west
Los Angeles in one of the most expensive areas of the state.
   Located at 668 St. Cloud Road, the home is near the Kirkeby
estate where the television show Beverly Hillbillies was filmed.
   The Reagans' neighbors will include celebrities such as
Elizabeth Taylor, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joan Rivers, Mac Davis, Burt
Bacharach and Robert Stack.
   Real estate agents say the value of the home has shot up since
it was purchased in 1986 for the Reagans by a consortium of about
20 people, who have incorporated as the Wall Management Services
Inc.
   Jeff Hyland of the Los Angeles firm of Alvarez, Hyland & Young
said the value of the land alone could be as much as $3 million now.
   The rental fee and the terms of the lease were negotiated by
representatives of the Reagans and the owners, based on fair-market
rental estimates from two independent appraisers, Fitzwater said.
   Prior to buying the property, the proposed owners obtained a
legal opinion from the Office of Government Ethics.
   The ethics office said ``any potential lease or sale of the
house to the president and Mrs. Reagan will comply with standards
of conduct regulations and conflict of interest statutes so long as
the president pays a fair market rental or purchase price for the
house,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Reagans' lease gives them the option to renew the agreement
or purchase the house, Fitzwater said. No purchase price terms are
set in the lease, he added.
   The spokesman said the lease allows the Reagans ``to make
further decisions about the home once the president is out of
office and has exact knowledge of the assets and income in his
blind trust.''
   The house is expected to be ready for occupancy in late 1988,
before Reagan moves out of the White House next Jan. 20.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and European officials disagreed
Thursday over how to prevent food surpluses from building up in the
developed nations when much of the Third World goes hungry.
   The two-day World Food Conference, organized by the European
Parliament, brought together 200 agriculture and development
experts to discuss the problem of surplus food output in parts of
the world and continuing shortages elsewhere.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said only an end to
farm subsidies ``will bring about the necessary reform.''
   Continuing current policies, ``will inevitably lead to greater
surpluses, more wasted resources ... more disincentives for
economic expansion in developing countries and more trade
confrontation,'' Lyng told the delegates.
   The United States is seeking an end to all state aids to farmers
by 2000 in the current round of trade liberalization talks within
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   But Frans Andriessen, the European Economic Community
Agriculture Commissioner, said the U.S. proposal was ``neither
possible nor desirable.''
   ``Some form of stabilization and protectionism ... will always
be needed,'' given the unpredictability of food production.
   He said the 12-nation EEC agreed in February to curb its runaway
growth of farm output through production ceilings and penalties for
overproducers.
   He termed this ``a major contribution'' toward restoring a
balance between supply and demand. He added, ``European farmers
expect a similar action by other producing areas.''
   The United States and the EEC are the world's largest food
producers.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda appealed for an end to
``economic parochialism'' and greater liberalization of world trade.
   He urged the developed nations to put aside national
differences. ``We have to move from blind protectionism to ...
regional and finally global harmonized free movement of goods and
services,'' he said.
   ``The social and economic world order ... can no longer permit
undue overemphasis on what I wish to call economic parochalism.''
   Kaunda urged food producers not to dump ``surplus stocks on us
through food aid'' but to help the Third World become
self-sufficient.
   Concessions to Third World producers, he said, ``must be seen as
a major incentive for promoting self-reliance in development more
appropriate than food aid.''
   The delegates to the conference hope to adopt a common statement
at the end.
   A preliminary draft obtained by The Associated Press calls on
key food producing nations to switch from accross-the-board food
price subsidies to income supports for needy farmers.
   Ending subsidies, the draft said, should be joint effort by all
industrial nations.
   Delegates said the draft, if adopted, would echo the EEC's
views, rather than the more radical ones of the United States, as a
way to come to grips with the imbalance in supply and demand.
   Lyng said the United States, in seeking a way out of the world's
farm trade problems through GATT, prefered a ``multilateral
solution.''
   It would, however, ``continue to support U.S. agriculture
vigorously ... if fair trade cannot be achieved multilaterally,''
he added.
   The U.S. proposal for a radical end to farm subsidies was backed
by Europe's International Organization of Consumers Unions which
said ``agricultural export subsidies and measures with equivalent
effect should be phased out over the next 10 years.''
   It added the developed nations should rid themselves of food
surpluses through lower prices for farmers, giving food to its own
needy citizens and those in the world's poor regions.
   Western food must be given to developing nations in emergency
cases only, the group said in a paper. ``Long-term Western food aid
carries the disadvantage that it competes with ... locally grown
food.''
   It criticized as unfair to the Third World the repeated EEC
efforts to tax imports of oils and fats and to pay EEC farmers a
bonus to use some of their cereal output as animal feed.

<HEAD>U.S. to Sell Gyroscopes to India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has agreed to sell
India a ring laser gyroscope for use in India's development of its
own light combat aircraft.
   The sale of the device, which is used to stabilize the steering
mechanism of a jet, is the latest in a series of technology
transfers from the Untied States to India for the project. Last
year, the United States approved the transfer of 10 General
Electric engines for the plane.
   The sale of the gyroscope was announced Wednesday by U.S.
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carclucci, who noted that ``since the
memorandum of understanding in 1983, the transfer of technology
items has gone up by 400 percent'' from the United States to India.
   The agreement was signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's mother
and predecessor, Indira Gandhi.
   Talks on further transfer of technology for the combat aircraft
are continuing.
   Carlucci also confirmed that ``there has been formal
notification to Congress'' of the transfer of 11 F-16 fighter jets
to Pakistan. He described them as ``attrition aircraft'' to replace
jets Pakistan had lost.
   He said the jets were part of the recently approved $1.04
billion, six-year aid package to Pakistan.

   An American and a Frenchman whose independent
studies led to the discovery of the AIDS virus shared the Japan
Prize in preventive medicine Thursday.
   The Science and Technology Foundation of Japan awarded another
prize in the same category to U.S., Japanese and Australian
scientists credited with eradicating smallpox from the earth.
   French scientist Georges Vendryes, who pioneered development of
the fast-breeder type nuclear reactor, won the Japan Prize for
energy technology.
   Robert C. Gallo of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and
Luc Montagnier of France's Pasteur institute shared a $200,000
prize for their work on AIDS.
   Working separately, Gallo and Montagnier both discovered the
deadly virus and helped develop blood tests to detect infection.
   ``There would be no mistake in thinking that the methodology has
been established by the two doctors for the control of an
infectious disease which has become a major problem of the 20th
Century,'' the prize committee said.
   ``In parts of the world (AIDS) is akin to genocide,'' Gallo said
in accepting the prize at the National Theater. ``It is global, and
mostly, it destroys the young.''
   Donald A. Henderson of the United States, Isao Arita of Japan
and Frank Fenner of Australia shared $200,000 for their work on
smallpox. The World Health Organization declared the disease
eradicated in 1980, three years after the last patient was reported
in Somalia.
   Vendryes was awarded $400,000.
   The Japan Prize, awarded in two categories each year since 1985,
rewards scientific and technological achievements that contribute
to world peace and prosperity. Previous prizes have gone to five
Americans, an Indian and an Israeli.

<HEAD>Two More Victims Added To Green River Serial-Killer List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two names have been added to the official list of
victims of the Green River serial-killer, police said.
   The latest identified victim in the nation's largest unsolved
serial-murder case is Tammie Charlene Liles, 16, of Snohomish,
whose skeletal remains were found in Tualatin, Ore. The bodies of
Ms. Liles and an unidentified female were dumped in a wooded area
near the grounds of the Tualatin Country Club, said Bob Evans,
commander of the King County Police Green River task force.
   The unidentified remains also were added to the list Thursday.
   The official tally of Green River victims stands at 39, and nine
other missing women are believed to be victims.
   The case takes its name from the river south of Seattle where
the bodies of the first five victims were found in 1982. Many of
the victims have had histories of prostitution, and many were known
to frequent the Sea-Tac strip near Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   Ms. Liles, who was believed to be working as a prostitute,
disappeared in June 1983, Evans said.
   She was identified last month when her family contacted the task
force to report her missing, Evans said. She was identified March 8
through dental records by the King County medical examiner's office.
   Elliott Woodall, the spokesman for the Snohomish County
sheriff's office, said last month that Ms. Liles was reported as a
runaway in April 1983. The sheriff's office followed up the report
several months later, he said, and the family said Ms. Liles was
living in Tacoma and planning to get married.
   ``We cleared her from runaway status (in May 1984) based on that
information,'' Woodall said.
   Evans said police now believe the family was misinformed.
   Two other victims on the official list also were found in
Oregon. Those bodies were found in June 1985 in Washington County,
four miles from the site of the Liles body.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it plans to declare seven more ``Superfund'' toxic dump
sites cleaned up.
   EPA says it has completed work at 37 sites, and has declared 13
clean since the cleanup effort began seven years ago. At another
seven sites, all work as been completed except groundwater pumping
for purification, which may continue for years or decades.
   Often chided for the small number of cleanups completed, EPA
says such ``maintenance'' pumping will continue to keep the number
of ``walkaway'' cleanups small.
   Two more sites were chosen for a cleanup declaration last month.
Those two and the seven announced Thursday are subject to public
comment before the declaration is made formally.
   The agency has estimated that there may be 25,000 sites needing
attention. Most are small, but 951 have been chosen for a priority
list eligible for federal cleanup funds from the Superfund program.
Some 149 of those have not been formally placed on the list.
   EPA says it has completed 604 initial site investigations,
decided on a cleanup method for 230 and has done some actual
cleanup work, as opposed to mere paperwork, at 189 sites,
frequently as a temporary measure until a cleanup can be completed
or a method decided on. Actual cleanups are currently under way at
60 sites.
   Here are the seven sites in Thursday's announcement:
   _Brooks, Ky., ``Valley of the Drums,'' a former chemical dump
and drum recycling center 12 miles south of Louisville where work
began in 1979, the year before enactment of the Superfund program.
Some 17,000 drums had to removed.
   _Lee's Lane landfill in Louisville, 125 acres of old quarry used
for chemical disposal from 1948 to 1975.
   _Galloway Pits, Galloway, Tenn., a 10-acre site where illegal
pesticide disposal was discovered in 1982.
   _Newport, Ky., former municipal dump.
   _Mowbray Engineering Co., site at Greenville, Ala., where
electrical transformers had been renovated.
   _Matthews Electroplating Co. site near Salem, Va., where an
electroplating plant operated in the 1970s.
   _Presque Isle, an abandoned gas well at Erie, Pa.
   The Brooks and Salem sites were designated by the state
governors several years ago as the worst in their states.
   The sites announced last month, both in Florida, are Tri-City
Oil Conservationist Inc., Tampa, where waste oil was reclaimed, and
an underground solvent spill at Miami International Airport called
the Varsol spill site.

<HEAD>Simon's Statement As He Suspends His Presidential Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of Sen. Paul Simon's
statement Thursday as he suspended his campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   I am today suspending my campaign for the presidency.
   I'm grateful to all who have campaigned with me and for me.
   And I leave the field of active campaigning with no regrets for
having made the race.
   No regrets, first, because it has been an exhilarating
experience to get to know our nation better, both our difficulties
and our potential.
   I understand more fully the plight of native Americans in South
Dakota, the nuclear energy in New Hampshire and New York, the
similarities and difficulties that farmers in Iowa and Wisconsin
share with their Illinois counterparts, the isolation of a small
city in Wyoming in winter, the disfigurement oil rigs could cause
to the magnificent coastline of California, the sadness of
unemployment in Starr County, Texas, and the wasted humanity in too
much of our nation.
   But I've also come to know better a nation with potential, a
nation that is limited not by our talent and resources, but by our
dreams and our leadership.
   Where I have had the opportunity to reach people I have seen
them respond with a selflessness that must be tapped.
   Americans instinctively know that we are one nation, one family,
and when anyone in that family hurts, all of us eventually hurt.
   There really is a yearning across this land for leadership that
appeals to the noble in us rather than the greed in us.
   I wish I had been able to tap that yearning more effectively.
   But to the extent my supporters and I have been able to reach
out and talk about programs and a vision of a better nation, to
that extent we have helped to make possible the building of a
better nation.
   For that, I am grateful to far too many people to be
acknowledged here, but they include my wife Jeanne, a superb
campaigner; my daughter Sheila and her husband Perry Knop, who were
married Sept. 12, and have since been honeymooning in places like
Audubon, Iowa, and Berlin, N.H., and Sturgeon Bay, Wis., and my
son, Martin, my traveling companion, photographer and consultant.
   No candidate could have stronger family support.
   To the staff of my campaign, who worked long hours for limited
pay, to our chairman Chuck Manatt, and the countless volunteers,
more volunteers than any other campaign, who are unbelievable in
their efforts; to those who raised money against great odds, to a
host of others I should be acknowledging my gratitude.
   And to the people of Illinois who have been both supportive and
understanding, my full efforts will now be devoted to being your
senator, and I shall be a better senator because of this rich
experience.
   The Polish writer, Kazimierz Brandys, tells a story of two who
were approached during a period of ferment in Poland and asked to
protest the illegal arrest and imprisonment of a leading
intellectual.
   One refused to sign and said, ``I can't. I have a son.''
   The other immediately took out his pen and said, ``I have to
sign because I have a son.''
   Both acts are understandable.
   But the legacy of honor that one leaves is vastly different than
the other.
   I entered this race beause I have a daughter and a son.
   I entered this race because I have had the good fortune to
understand the vast difference in the lives of millions of people
action by government can make.

<TEXT>
   School officials at Hamilton High School in Milwaukee, Wis., who
knew I helped create the law requiring that those with disabilities
be given a chance by our public schools, arranged for a chorus of
retarded young people to sing for me.
   They recited the preamble to the Constitution in unison, and
then sang, ``This is My Country.''
   I glanced at the reporters covering the event, and noted the
moist eyes.
   We all had them.
   Without that change in the law, probably half of those young
people would be in institutions today.
   Government is not the enemy.
   Government is simply a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely.
   In passing that law, we used it wisely, compassionately.
   ``To form a more perfect union,'' these students recited from
the Constitution, a goal partially achieved but in large measure
still unattained.
   We can do better, my friends.
   I entered this race because I want this generation to give the
coming generations a sound economy, not an uncontrollable debt.
   I entered this race because I see a nation indifferent to the
wasted lives of far too many; children in schools where fear
dominates rather than learning; older citizens and their families
financially devastated by long-term care needs; hard-working
farmers devastated by short-sighted government policies; people
eager to work who cannot find a job, lose pride in themselves and
their families and their nation; and communities gripped by the
terror of crime.
   I entered this race because I know that the president of the
United States can lead our nation and other nations away from the
arms race.
   The blight of the arms race, and unemployment, and crime, and
inadequate health care, and educational shortcomings are not the
results of God, but the result of insensitive leadership _ chosen
by a people who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they
might be.
   I know we can do better.
   You know we can do better.
   I want leadership that will provide that.
   After the last primary on June 7, I will meet with my delegates
to determine what course should be followed.
   In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows
what twists and turns may develop between now and then.
   There will be many encounters with fate before the contest is
ultimately decided in a wide-open convention.
   For that reason, while I am ceasing all campaigning, I will make
no decision formally withdrawing as a candidate until after June 7,
though I have no illusions that the nomination will come my way.
   But I want my delegates to have a voice in this nation's future.
   We will weigh the options then.
   I want to be in a position to do everything I can to help unify
the party, and, ultimately, the nation.
   I'm grateful to those who've contributed to the nation's
dialogue who have withdrawn _ Joe Biden, Dick Gephardt, Gary Hart
and Bruce Babbitt.
   And I'm appreciative of the efforts already made and still to be
made by Jesse Jackson, Mike Dukakis, and Al Gore.
   All three have been working hard, discussing and refining the
issues, sharpening our knowledge and challenging our conscience.
   Delegates to the convention probably will select one of these
three who have come to know this nation well.
   To those who have already asked the inevitable question, ``Will
you run in 1992?'' I have two responses.
   First, I expect to campaign for a Democratic president for
re-election in 1992.
   Second, running for president is a little like taking an
ice-cold shower. It's a great one-time experience but I have no
yearning for a repeat performance.
   But we have a great nation, and all of us working together can
make it a better nation.
   Thank you.

   President Reagan is pleased with
news of an agreement that could lead to the beginning next month of
a Soviet Army withdrawal from Afghanistan, White House chief of
staff Howard Baker said today.
   Baker told reporters that Reagan believes Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's agreement with Afghan leaders clearing the way for
settlement of the 10-year-old Afghan war ``is a step forward.''
   But Baker also said Reagan ``wants to see the fine print. He
wants to see the details of the arrangement. He wants to know the
reaction and the interpretation of the Soviet Union.''
   ``So the president is cautiously optimistic,'' Baker told
reporters outside a seaside resort hotel here.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had said Wednesday that
planning for Reagan's summit in Moscow with Gorbachev ``is on
track'' and won't be derailed by any continuing Soviet military
presence in Afghanistan.
   In a briefing that also touched on Panama, Fitzwater said Reagan
will ``press the case'' for a pullout if Soviet occupation forces
are still in Afghanistan when the summit begins May 29.
   But in Tashkent, Gorbachev and Afghan leaders announced today
that they had resolved problems blocking a settlement, and the
Soviets offered to start pulling troops out of the country on May
15 if agreement is reached in Geneva on the terms for that
withdrawal.
   Baker said today that ``we've got to examine that communique
carefully. We've had no direct communication, I think, from the
Soviets so far.''
   The chief of staff said the agreement ``may very well lead to a
resolution of these issues and a pullout of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.''
   Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell, told reporters
that ``it is a step forward and the Soviets themselves say that
they think conditions are present so that they could begin the
pullout on the 15th of May, and we hope that is the case.''
   ``But we have to see the final document, and we have to have
formal response from the Soviets to our questions of last week,''
Powell said.
   He said, ``I think it's important to reinforce our position that
there has to be symmetry in the arrangements between us and the
Soviet Union, so that as long as they are able to continue
providing military aid to the Kabul regime, we will retain the
right to provide military aid'' to the Afghan rebels.
   Asked Wednesday whether a continuing Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan could sabotage the summit, Fitzwater said, ``That might
be an even better reason to go.''
   ``The summit is on track and there are a number of issues the
president will push while he is in the Soviet Union. ... And if we
don't have action to pull the troops out of (Afghanistan) by the
time we go, I think that would ... probably move to the very top of
the president's agenda,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater had said Wednesday that it is difficult to say whether
Soviet troops will be withdrawn by the time Reagan visits Moscow.
   Discussing U.S. pressure to force Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega out of power, Fitzwater said another 800 U.S.
Marines will be sent to the Central American nation.
   But Fitzwater insisted that the movement of the Marines from
Camp Pendleton, Calif., to a jungle training facility at Fort
Sherman in Panama has nothing to do with the increasing U.S.
military show of force there.
   ``This unit training deployment has been scheduled since
December,'' he said. ``These (troops) will be there for three weeks
and they'll come out.''
   On other topics, Fitzwater cautioned against concluding that
Reagan plans to grant pardons to former White House aides John M.
Poindexter and Oliver L. North, who have been indicted in the
Iran-Contra case.
   A congressman who attended a March 22 meeting quoted Reagan as
saying ``I like the sound of those words,'' when someone in the
meeting broached the possibility of pardons.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that the remark seemed to indicate that
Reagan favors pardons for his former top aides, but he said, ``I
don't believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the
basis of that throwaway comment.''

   American authorities, often aided by friendly
foreign governments, have had some successes lately luring or
forcing criminal suspects out of safe havens abroad into the long
arms of the law.
   Some people call it kidnapping, but federal courts have
generally approved the practice.
   The latest dramatic case occurred this week when Honduran police
acting on information from U.S. marshals arrested alleged
international cocaine czar Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros at his home
in Honduras, and started him on a plane journey that ended in the
federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.
   Matta, who escaped from a U.S. jail in 1971 and has been charged
with subsequent drug offenses in the United States, also was sought
for questioning in the murder of a U.S. narcotics agent.
   Honduran legislators, citing a law against extradition of
Honduran citizens, labeled the transfer a kidnapping, but the U.S.
Marshals Service called it ``a major milestone in our worldwide
assault on illegal drug trafficking.''
   The United States has extradition treaties with more than 100
countries, but each accord is different and some require long and
often fruitless court proceedings that frustrate U.S. law
enforcement agents' desire to get their hands on suspects.
   Getting other countries to help by using what are
euphemistically called ``non-diplomatic means'' _ as in the Matta
case _ are common, law enforcement authorities say, though no
statistics on such arrests are published.
   Police jokingly refer to these methods as ``Mexican
Extraditions,'' a reference to the longstanding Mexican practice of
shooing suspects wanted in the United States across the border,
where U.S. police are waiting.
   In the Matta case, two countries helped. The Hondurans put him
on a plane to the Dominican Republic without a passport. Officials
in that country expelled him by placing him aboard a flight bound
for New York. U.S. marshals aboard the aircraft arrested him
immediately.
   Last year, Carlos Lehder, a reputed drug kingpin from Colombia,
was extradited to the United States at the request of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   Sometimes, the United States captures people abroad without
overt assistance from foreign nations.
   Last year, according to the FBI, undercover agents tracking
Fawaz Younis, a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian
aircraft, tricked him into going aboard a yacht in the
Mediterranean Sea and arrested him under a U.S. law giving American
courts jurisdiction to try suspected terrorists who act against
U.S. citizens. Younis is awaiting trial in Washington.
   In 1982, former CIA agent Edwin Wilson, who had fled to Libya
after being indicted on weapons sales charges, was duped by an
acquaintance into flying to the Dominican Republic.
   Authorities there put him on a non-stop flight to the United
States, where he was arrested.
   Timothy Leary, the drug culture guru who escaped in 1970 from a
California jail, was turned over to U.S. narcotics agents in
Afghanistan even though the two countries had no extradition treaty.
   Defense attorneys in some of the celebrated cases _ notably the
Wilson and Younis cases _ have sought dismissal of charges on
grounds the overseas arrests violated the defendants' rights by, in
effect, kidnapping them.
   Those requests, however, generally have been denied. The courts
have said the manner of a suspect's arrest _ even an abduction _ is
not relevant in assessing guilt or innocence.
   The only exception, based on a plea by a defendant brought back
from Uruguay in the 1960s, would be a case in which the suspect's
treatment, such as torture, was so outrageous it ``shocked the
conscience'' of the court. Even then, a suspect would have to prove
it was U.S. authorities who committed the torture.
   Despite success in capturing such suspects as Younis and Wilson,
other big fish have eluded the U.S. net.
   Since 1974, the United States has been trying to extradite
fugitive financier Robert L. Vesco to prosecute him on charges of
looting $224 million from an international investor's fund. Vesco
first went to Costa Rica and the Bahamas. He has since emerged in
Cuba, beyond the reach of American police.
   The United States also tried for many months to arrange the
arrest of Abu Abbas, alleged mastermind of the 1985 hijacking of
the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, during which New Yorker Leon
Klinghoffer was killed.
   Abbas was aboard an Egyptian airliner forced down in Sicily by
U.S. Navy jets, but Italian authorities released him and he was
later seen in several Islamic countries.

   Mayor John K. Bullard came as a guest
to a luncheon honoring local heroes, but he left a hero himself
after saving a choking woman.
   ``He saved my life,'' Amy Macomber, 55, of Fairhaven, said. ``I
couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. Then John jumped up, pushed his
chair back and practically lifted me up off the floor'' while
performing the Heimlich maneuver.
   The application of sudden upward pressure on the upper abdomen
is intended to force a foreign object from the windpipe. Bullard
had to apply it at least three times before dislodging a piece of
chicken that had prevented Mrs. Macomber from breathing.
   ``Everyone in the room could have done the same thing,'' he
said. ``I just happened to be the closest.''
   The annual Wamsutta Club luncheon Wednesday, sponsored by The
Standard-Times, honors residents for heroic, selfless and
courageous deeds. They are first recognized in the newspaper's Hats
Off column, published the last day of every month.
   Mrs. Macomber was being honored for thwarting a would-be robber
at her liquor store last year by smashing his knuckles with a rum
bottle.
   ``It was a truly heroic act,'' said Standard-Times Editor James
Ragsdale. ``Here we are, in a room celebrating many people who had
themselves saved lives, and the mayor saved a life himself. Perhaps
we should give him the Hats Off Award of the Year. He saved us from
tragedy.''

   A nuclear weapons test with an explosive
force of less than 20,000 tons of TNT was detonated Thursday at the
Nevada Test Site.
   It was the second announced U.S. test of 1988. The Soviet Union
announced its third test of the year Easter Sunday.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said the test, code-named
Abilene, was detonated in a shaft 800 feet beneath the surface of
Yucca Flat, 75 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Boyer said he felt no ground motion at a control point a few
miles from ground zero.
   The test is in the lower range of those conducted at the desert
site. All tests are announced as having an explosive range of less
than 20 kilotons or 20 to 150 kilotons. Larger tests, which
sometimes shake high-rise buildings in Las Vegas, are normally
announced in advance.
   A subsidence was reported 15 minutes after the 10:15 a.m. test.
DOE officials say that is a good sign because it means the ground
has settled over the weapon chamber.

<HEAD>Important Art Collection Finds Temporary Home In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of one of the world's most
important private art collections will hang in Spain for at least
10 years under an agreement signed Thursday.
   The arrival of 700 to 800 of the $2 billion Thyssen collection's
most significant paintings will cement the Spanish capital's
reputation as a leading world art center.
   The agreement was signed by collector Baron Hans Heinrich
Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Spanish government. The ceremony took
place across the street from Prado museum in the 19th-century
Villahermosa Palace, which Spanish authorities are refurbishing to
devote exclusively to the new works.
   The collection is expected to open to the public in November.
   Thyssen said his decision to chose Spain over museums in the
United States, Switzerland and West Germany was ``completely
objective'' but stressed that his ties to Spain played a deciding
role.
   The Baron's fifth wife, Spanish-born Carmen Cervera, was an
important factor in the final decision, according one of the plan's
chief architects, the Duke of Badajoz, who also is the
brother-in-law of King Juan Carlos.
   Cervera, a former beauty queen and widow of ``Tarzan'' actor Lex
Barker, ``has a great influence over her husband,'' he said.
   The duke said Thyssen had not yet completed the choice of which
paintings would make up the Madrid collection, but the agreement
stipulates they include ``the most significant paintings'' of the
Thyssen collection.
   The duke said the 10-year loan agreement paves the way for a
second pact to make Spain the collection's permanent home.
   ``It takes away a bit of the tension,'' he said. ``Now we can
proceed with calm to work out the definitive agreement.''
   A beaming Culture Minister Javier Solana said the collection
``is going to fundamentally improve the cultural life of our
country.''
   The Swiss-based Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Trust, headed by
the baron, owns 1,600 paintings from the 13th to 20th centuries,
including 570 old masters. The collection was started by his
father, Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a German steel baron who died
in 1947.
   News that Thyssen was looking for a bigger home for the bulk of
the paintings currently housed at his Villa Favorita residence in
Lugano, Switzerland, elicited offers from Spain, the Getty Museum
in Malibu, Calif., and museums in several West German cities.
   The 10-year loan is to be administered by a private foundation
set up by the Spanish government and Thyssen, and chaired by the
baron.
   The agreement stipulates that the pieces on loan to Spain will
be able to travel freely to other museums without prior approval
from Spanish authorities.

   The health minister of Nepal set fire to a pile of 35,000
cigarette butts on Thursday, Roman youths gave tourists apples for
their smokes, and Chinese tried ointments and shock therapy to get
through a day without tobacco.
   Thursday was the first worldwide ``No Tobacco Day,'' sponsored
by the World Health Organization. It coincided with the 40th
anniversary of the United Nations agency and was designed to urge
people to stop smoking or using chewing tobacco.
   Anti-smoking activists drove around the northern Japanese city
of Hokkaido in a car equipped with a loudspeaker asking smokers to
be considerate of non-smokers.
   ZDF television in West Germany showed grim footage of patients
on a cancer ward. In Spain, which introduced cigars and cigarettes
to much of the world more than 300 years ago, officials in Madrid,
Barcelona and Valencia sponsored contests for the best anti-smoking
posters.
   The WHO campaign had no apparent effect in Lebanon, however. The
streets and sidewalk cafes of Beirut were filled with smokers,
despite radio broadcasts and posters denouncing the perils of
puffing tobacco.
   ``Because of the civil war, the number of smokers in Lebanon has
increased dramatically,'' said Soha Tamim, a public health officer
at the American University Hospital. Lebanon's civil war has raged
since 1975.
   In Geneva, WHO Director General Halfdan Mahler said tobacco use
``is tantamount to slow-motion suicide.'' He urged smokers and
other tobacco users to stop for the day and then extend that ``into
a week, a month, a year.''
   The WHO awarded 40 medals to people and organizations it said
promoted the idea of a tobacco-free society. They included former
President Jimmy Carter, actor Larry Hagman, Cuban leader Fidel
Castro, the Soviet airline Aeroflot and the U.S. carrier Northwest
Airlines.
   In Nepal, the cigarette butts were collected by volunteers of
the Nepal Cancer Relief Society. The health minister, Mrs. Shushila
Thapa, lighted the pile during a ceremony in an open theater in the
center of Katmandu.
   Major stores in Beijing stopped selling cigarettes for the day,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   In front of the Museum of Chinese History facing the central
Tiananmen Square, educational stands were set up to help smokers
who wanted to quit. Stalls sold ``anti-smoking ointment,''
``restrain-and-stop-smoking drops,'' herbs and even a ``quit
smoking mouth gargle'' to deter smoking. A cancerous lung, encased
in plastic, also was on display.
   For the really desperate, merchants were offering the
``longevity brand electrotherapy device for helping give up smoking
and protecting health.''
   The device, which sold for about $4, consists of battery-powered
electrodes attached to the cheeks and is activated every time the
user gets the urge for a smoke.
   There was no indication whether China's most famous
chain-smoker, senior leader Deng Xiaoping, complied with the
government's request to stop smoking for a day. China has 300
million smokers, the world's highest number.
   From the Pantheon to the Via Veneto in Rome, volunteers handed
out baskets of apples with the message ``A piece of fruit is OK,
but cigarette smoke isn't. An apple goes farther than the
cigarette.'' They also walked around town asking smokers to put out
their cigarettes in exchange for flowers or apples.
   Colorfully dressed women in Budapest, Hungary, collected money
for the fight against cancer. One of them who stood in Calvin
Square downtown said she collected the equivalent of more than $200
from passersby.
   According to WHO, 2.5 million people die each year from
tobacco-related diseases, including lung cancer, chronic
bronchitis, emphysema and heart disease. WHO says this represents
one death every 13 seconds.
   The organization estimates that, in industrialized countries,
one-third of all people over 15 are smokers, while in the Third
World about half of all males and 10 percent of females over 15 are
smokers.
   Carter, a former supporter of the tobacco industry, was given an
award for his ``candid change of views'' that led him to write in
1986 that he had become ``increasingly active in attempting to
spare people from the tobacco addiction,'' WHO said.
   Hagman, star of the TV series ``Dallas,'' was commended for
serving as chairman for eight years of the ``Great American
Smokeout.'' WHO said that due to his influence, tobacco is never
portrayed on ``Dallas.''
   Castro was honored for pledging in 1981 never to smoke in public
and subsequently quitting.
   Cuba, which is known worldwide for its fine cigars, participated
in the no-smoking day. Despite being a major tobacco producer, Cuba
has launched a strong anti-smoking campaign.
   Northwest Airlines was praised for being the first carrier in
the world to fly regular smoke-free routes internationally, and
Aeroflot ``for introducing the smoke-free four-hour flight in 1978,
and for being the first to make all internal flights smoke-free,
from January 1982.''
   In July, South African Airways banned smoking on all domestic
flights.

   Police found the body of a kidnapped
Dutch tycoon buried in a forest after his abductor admitted
murdering his captive seven months ago and led authorities to the
grave, officials said Thursday.
   The discovery Wednesday night of the body of grocery baron
Gerrit Jan Heijn ended the nation's longest kidnap case. Heijn's
body was dug up near the northeastern village of Renkum, said Theo
Bot, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
   An unemployed architect admitted kidnapping Heijn, 56, on Sept.
9, 1987, and shooting him to death a few hours later, Bot said.
   Most of the ransom of 8 million guilders (about $4.3 million)
and 1,200 diamonds paid by Heijn's family was found in the
suspect's home, along with the gun used to kill Heijn, Bot said.
   The case became known as the ``Heijn Affair'' and, despite a
news blackout, dominated headlines throughout the nation. It is the
first modern Dutch kidnapping case in which a prominent victim was
killed.
   In line with police procedure, authorities refused to identify
the suspect except by his initials, P.E. They said he lived in the
village of Landsmeer, a few miles north of Amsterdam and about 75
miles from where Heijn was buried.
   The 45-year-old architect was arrested early Wednesday at home,
police said.
   Bot said police also took into custody the man's wife and his
three children, aged 17 to 25, but he said it was unclear if they
had any role in the crime.
   Heijn was kidnapped at gunpoint Sept. 9 as he left his home for
a dentist's appointment. He was vice-chairman of the family-run
Ahold grocery concern, which operates the nation's largest
supermarket chain, Albert Heijn.
   Ahold also owns the Giant Food and Bi-Lo stores in the United
States.
   The suspect told police he waited for Heijn outside the family
villa in the affluent Bloemendaal suburb, drove Heijn to the forest
in a stolen car and shot the executive in the head, Bot said.
   The suspect told interrogators he then cut off one of Heijn's
little fingers and buried him later that day, Bot said.
   Police spokeswoman Anne Geelof said in an interview with Dutch
television that police picked up the suspect's trail after the
discovery of a 250-guilder note from the ransom payment early this
year at a Landsmeer bank.
   The banknote was traced back to a supermarket in northern
Amsterdam, which was then put under police surveillance, Geelof
said.
   Several weeks after the first banknote surfaced, another
250-guilder note was spent at the supermarket by one of those now
under arrest, according to Geelof.
   The suspect's house was then put under police surveillance.
   The Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool said the suspect had been
living on welfare after several small businesses he started failed.
   Ahold communicated with the abductors through a series of coded
advertisements in Dutch newspapers, and the ransom was paid on Nov.
27.
   In early October, Heijn's little finger was mailed to Ahold.
   Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes said in December that
Heijn was presumed dead.
   There was no indication that Heijn knew the suspect, police said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Talks to Cuomo: No Endorsement Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said he talked
Thursday with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose elusive endorsement
he described as ``relevant'' to New York primary voters despite
Cuomo's opinion otherwise.
   Dukakis, who has been courting a Cuomo endorsement for months,
said his discussion with Cuomo was ``a very pleasant conversation.''
   ``I'm sure we will be speaking frequently,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked if he felt a Cuomo endorsement would still be helpful with
less than two weeks to go before the New York primary, Dukakis
said, ``Sure it's relevant. People in New York and across this
country care very deeply about what Gov. Cuomo thinks and what
other governors think. As I said the other day, that is a decision
that he has to make. I respect it.''
   Cuomo, who appears to be leaning toward no endorsement, said
Thursday his opinion means less and less as the primary approaches.
``Who cares what ... Mario Cuomo says?'' he told reporters in
Albany.
   Dukakis said Sen. Paul Simon's decision to put his presidential
campaign on hold brings heightened attention to the trio of
Democratic hopefuls remaining.
   ``As I said to somebody the other day,'' Dukakis said with a
smile, ``it suddenly struck me Tuesday night that this was all
getting kind of serious.''
   The governor told a Statehouse news conference that Simon's
decision Thursday ``means that those of us who continue to be
strong contenders are going to be looked at, observed, and listened
to even more carefully and more intensively.''
   ``So it's for me, I think, another step in the road, and I hope
a good step in the sense that I've got an opportunity now to take
my case to the people of New York and ask them to make some choices
among the three candidates that now remain.''
   Asked about Simon's refusal to release his 170 delegates,
Dukakis said, ``It is his decision really as to what happens now
with respect to his delegates. Obviously, I want every delegate I
can get.''

<HEAD>Shultz Says Hussein Possible Negotiating Partner for Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Thursday that King Hussein of Jordan is a possible partner for
peace talks and that Israel should take its cue from him.
   Shultz, who is nearing the end of an arduous Middle East peace
shuttle, returned from Saudi Arabia for more talks with the king
and lauded Hussein's ``constructive'' approach to the U.S. peace
plan for the second day in a row.
   Indirectly applying pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, Shultz said ``the message of that to Israel is here is a
possible Arab partner in negotiations.''
   But Shultz, who returns home Friday, acknowledged ``it remains
to be seen whether that can evolve'' into peace talks.
   Shamir remains opposed to an international peace conference,
which Hussein has demanded as a precondition to negotiations.
   Shultz said he was able to put ``a little life'' into his peace
plan since starting out in Jerusalem. But he said, ``I don't want
to exaggerate the progress that has been made.''
   The U.S. initiative calls for negotiations in two stages. The
first would seek to establish some self-rule for Palestinians who
live in the Israeli occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The second
would deal with the settlement of the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Four months of anti-occupation rioting in the occupied lands
have left more than 140 Palestinians and two Israelis dead. Israel
seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East War.
   Shultz spoke to reporters in al-Bareeda after an audience with
Saudi King Fahd in a palace about 300 miles north of the capital,
Riyadh.
   He said the king encouraged him to pursue Arab-Israeli
negotiations. ``I found a great measure of support and
encouragement,'' Shultz said.
   On another subject, Shultz said the United States was nearing an
agreement with the Soviet Union on Afghanistan that would permit
both sides to keep arming rival factions.
   ``Its an end-game situation,'' Shultz said, but he declined to
verify reports that a deal had already been struck. ``We are in
very active touch,'' he said.
   Shultz said he took up with the Saudis their purchase of
ballistic missiles from China, which has alarmed U.S. officials as
possibly sparking an escalation of missile arsenals throughout the
region.
   The rockets, delivered surreptitiously, can strike Israel or
Iran and range even beyond.
   Another U.S. official, briefing reporters aboard Shultz's flight
to Amman, said the Saudis gave assurances that the missiles were
non-nuclear: ``Non-today, non-tomorrow, non-forever.''
   He declined to say whether the Saudis gave the United States
permission to inspect the sites. Another U.S. official said Israel
gave Washington assurances it would not launch a pre-emptive strike
against the missiles.
   The purchase angered a group of 30 senators who have threatened
to try to block further arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The Reagan
administration apparently intends to go ahead with its plan to
provide new equipment for U.S.-built AWACS radar planes.
   ``That's obviously got great value,'' the U.S. official said,
defending the deal.
   In contrast to Arab-Israeli efforts, Shultz evidently has made
headway with Syria over a new constitution for Lebanon.
   He said he had ``quite constructive discussions'' with President
Hafez Assad in Damascus on Tuesday. The Syrians evidently are
prepared to help devise new constitutional guidelines that would
rearrange the division of power among Lebanon's warring factions.
   Describing the plight of the country, the U.S. official
traveling with Shultz recalled that ``people said a year ago, two
years ago, this is anarchy, total anarchy. Two years later, it's
worse.''
   Shultz's kind words for Hussein contrasted with his cool
approach to Shamir. On Wednesday, he urged Shamir to regard
negotiations with his neighbors as the most fundamental element in
Israel's security.
   In an interview with Israel television, Shultz lauded Hussein as
``a man of peace'' and said the questions he posed about the U.S.
plan showed he was engaged in the U.S. effort.
   Sizing up his five-day visit, Shultz said ``I think it's been
worthwhile and we've made a little progress here and there. But it
comes very hard and slow and I don't want to exaggerate the
progress that has been made. But it is important to keep at it.''

   A statue showing John F. Kennedy in mid-stride was
unveiled Thursday as the winner of a competition to select an
official memorial to the late president in his home state.
   His daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, unveiled a
three-foot plaster model of the bronze planned for the front lawn
of the Statehouse.
   The finished bronze sculpture that will be the state's official
memorial to Kennedy is scheduled to be unveiled May 29, 1989, which
would have been his 72nd birthday.
   It will stand a short distance from a statue of Henry Cabot
Lodge, the Republican whose son Kennedy defeated in 1952 in the
U.S. Senate campaign that launched his national career.
   ``There are many memorials to my father in this country and
around the world,'' Ms. Schlossberg said. ``But of all of them,
this one in the state he loved means the most.''
   The winning design in a year-long competition was executed by
artist Isabel McIlvain of Concord. It shows Kennedy in what members
of the selection commission called a classic pose _ mid-stride,
eyes forward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit
pocket.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis strode into the ceremony a few minutes
late to speak about how Kennedy inspired his own entrance into
politics and, ultimately, his bid this year for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Echoing some of the things critics have said about himself,
Dukakis said of Kennedy: ``People said he was too young, he
couldn't carry the South, he had a religious burden.''
   Longtime Kennedy aide Dave Powers, a member of the committee
that selected the winning scupture, told stories about the 1960
Kennedy campaign during which the Massachusetts senator startled
some visitors with his voice exercises, designed to prevent him
from losing his voice at a critical time.
   Powers said the sculpture reminded him of what E.B. White once
wrote of Kennedy: ``He never feared the weather. ... Instead he
challenged the wind, to change its direction and to cause it to
blow more kindly and more softly over the world and its people.''
   Another commitee member, Paula Kozol, said she liked Ms.
McIlvain's design because ``there's steadiness, a composure
reflected there.''
   A fund drive to raise $150,000 to build the eight-foot bronze
statue began officially Thursday when state Senate President
William Bulger of Boston gave the memorial organizers a check for
$1,000 from his own campaign fund.
   House Speaker George Keverian, the original mover behind the
Kennedy memorial commission, said he was proud that none of the
money needed to execute the bronze would come from the public
treasury.
   Bulger, a frequent jokester, added that with the state's current
tight fiscal situation and Dukakis' presidential aspirations, the
private fund-raiser was a particularly good idea. ``We want to keep
the economic miracle alive in Massachusetts at least until
November,'' Bulger said.
   For three months, five small clay models of the proposed statues
have been on display at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston's
Dorchester section.
   The other four finalists were by Frederick Hart of Markham, Va.;
Penelope Jencks of Newton; Norman Legassie of Old Lyme, Conn., and
Robert White of New York. Each artist received $4,000 to make the
models.
   McIlvain, who attended the ceremony, said she looked forward to
executing the bronze. ``I'm delighted to be doing this,'' she said.

   Marianne O'Neil, coordinator of the La Crosse Committee on
Aging, blew the whistle on the unlicensed games.
   ``I can't understand it,'' said Irene Beguin, director of the
Harry J. Olson Senior Center. ``Nobody can. We've played bingo for
25 years. The center's been in operation for 25 years.''
   O'Neil, who runs a less-popular variation of bingo on Sundays
involving food prizes and called ``prizo,'' said she felt she had
to report the weekday games.
   ``I thought I was doing my duty,'' she said Wednesday. ``It is
illegal, as you are well aware, to advertise bingo and to play for
cash without a license.''
   O'Neil wrote a letter to La Crosse County District Attorney
Scott Horne March 11 informing him of the games. Horne responded to
O'Neil's letter on March 22, agreeing that a license is needed.
O'Neil forwarded Horne's letter to the senior centers.
   A license costs $10 for each bingo session, plus $10 in annual
fees, according to Roxanne Peterson, one of the bingo control board
members with the state office in Madison.
   But center officials say the games barely break even, so the
state fees would be too much to pay.
   ``It's not the kind of activity that any prosecutor's office or
police agency is going to go out and make arrests for,'' Horne said
in an interview Wednesday.
   ``Clearly something can be worked out that could make this
legal, although at this time, technically, it is illegal,'' he said.
   ``Two weeks ago we quit,'' said Wesley Vollenweider, president
of the South Side Senior Citizen Center. ``We don't want to get in
trouble or get fined.''

   Thirteen white supremacists who were
tried on federal charges including murder, robbery and conspiring
to set up a new nation in the Pacific Northwest were found innocent
today of all charges.
   An all-white jury, which reported itself deadlocked on several
counts Wednesday, returned the verdict on its fourth day of
deliberations.
   Asked how the seven-week trial affected the white supremacist
movement, defendant Robert E. Miles said, ``Who knows? What
movement? What's left of it after this?''
   ``The government was going to send a message to the movement.
The movement sent a message to the overnment,'' said Thom Robb, the
national chaplain of the Ku Klux Klan, who hugged several of the
defendants after the verdict was announced.
   Defendant Louis Ray Beam Jr. celebrated his acquittal by going
to a Confederate memorial opposite the court building and claiming
victory against what he called the ``Zionist occupation
government.''
   ``There are over 150 other political prisoners being held in
ZOG's jails that need to be freed,'' the 41-year-old Beam said.
   ``I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today. I think
everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being
punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.''
   Nine defendants were charged with conspiring to overthrow the
government by violence. One of the nine, along with four other
defendants, was charged with conspiring to kill a federal judge and
an FBI agent. Two of the sedition defendants were accused of the
interstate transportation of stolen money.
   On Wednesday, the jury returned a verdict in the case of five of
the defendants charged with conspiracy to assassinate a federal
judge and an FBI agent, but reported a deadlock on other counts.
   U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold told the jury to continue
deliberating.
   During the trial, government witnesses said blacks and Jews were
targets of the conspirators, some of whom hold religious beliefs
that categorize Jews as ``the spawn of Satan,'' blacks as
``mud-people'' and the government and news media as under the
control of Jews.
   The government alleged that the supremacist groups robbed banks
and armored trucks of $4.1 million to finance their activities,
including about $1 million that is still missing.
   Defendants contended that there was no conspiracy and that the
conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, James
Ellison, 47, who led a supremacist group in Arkansas and now is
serving 20 years for racketeering. According to defendants, Ellison
made up the story to win a sentence reduction for cooperating with
the government.
   Defendants in the sedition case included three leaders of white
supremacist groups: Beam, 41, of Houston; Miles, 63, of Cohoctah,
Mich., and Richard G. Butler, 70, of Hayden Lake, Idaho.
   Maximum penalties for conviction include 20 years and a $20,000
fine for seditious conspiracy, life for conspiracy to murder, and
10 years and a $10,000 fine for transporting stolen money.
   When he arrived at the courthouse Wednesday, Miles was asked if
he had he ever advocated establishing an all-white nation in the
Northwest.
   ``Only in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Cohoctah,'' replied Miles, who
is pastor of the Mountain Church of Jesus Christ in Cohoctah.
   Six defendants in the sedition case are serving prison sentences
for other crimes. Two of them exchanged words with government
witness David Lake on Wednesday as they were being moved to the
Sebastian County Jail.
   Lake, a television producer from Marina Del Rey, Calif.,
testified during the trial's first week that he videotaped meetings
involving Butler and Butler's Aryan Nations group and defendants
Bruce Carroll Pierce and David Lane.
   Lake also testified about a tape-recording he secretly made of a
conversation in which Lane was trying to identify some major
telephone facility he could bomb.
   ``You pervert, homosexual, sell your pictures to Hustler,'' Lane
called out as Lake took photographs of the prisoners. Lake
testified that he wrote an article about his investigation of Aryan
Nations for Rebel, a magazine owned by Hustler publisher Larry
Flynt.
   ``Your day will come,'' Lane shouted.
   ``I'll see you in 200 years, David,'' Lake answered, a reference
to the 190-year prison sentence Lane is serving on other charges.
   The government says the supremacist groups robbed banks and
armored trucks of $4.1 million to finance their activities,
including about $1 million that is still missing.
   Defendants contend that there was no conspiracy and that the
conspiracy theory was invented by a key government witness, James
Ellison, 47, who led a supremacist group in Arkansas and now is
serving 20 years for racketeering. Ellison made up the story in
exchange for leniency, the defendants argue.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Baghdad Bombed; Iraq Fires Back With 11 Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said its warplanes sneaked through
Iraqi radar into Baghdad on Thursday and bombed a military base and
oil refinery in the city, killing or wounding dozens of Iraqi
soldiers.
   It was the first reported bombing of the Iraqi capital in three
years. Iraq denied the city was hit, but the ferocity of Iraqi
attacks later gave some credence to the Iranian claims.
   Both sides bombarded each other's cities and towns with missiles
and reported scores of civilian casualties.
   A U.N. team arrived in Baghdad from Geneva to investigate Iraqi
allegations that Iran used chemical weapons in a March 30-31 battle
in northeastern Iraq. Iran accused Iraq of using chemical weapons
in the same battle.
   In New York, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Larijani,
met with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to discuss
a cease-fire in the 7{-year-old war.
   Iran said squadrons of its fighter-bombers dodged Iraq's radar
net and the heavy air defenses around Baghdad just after 6 a.m. and
dropped bombs in two raids, 10 minutes apart.
   They were the first reported bombing raids on Baghdad, a city of
5 million, since March 1985 and came as Iraq marked the 41st
anniverary of the founding of its ruling Baath Socialist Party.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said the air raids ``completely caught the enemy by
surprise.''
   It said warplanes bombed the al-Doura refinery and the Khafaji
military camp on Baghdad's southern outskirts, ``killing or
wounding dozens of soldiers'' and leaving their targets on fire.
   Iran said all its planes returned safely. It did not say how
many were involved in the raid.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
quoted military communiques as saying only one Iranian jet got
through but was driven off by anti-aircraft fire before it could
drop any bombs.
   It said the plane was later shot down by Iraqi interceptors over
western Iran.
   In one of their most widespread missile barrages, the Iraqis
reported firing 11 long-range missiles: four at Tehran, three at
the central city of Isfahan, two at the industrial town of Karaj,
northwest of the capital, and one each at the holy city of Qom and
the northwestern city of Tabriz.
   It was the first time Karaj had been hit by a missile since the
war began in September 1980.
   In retaliation, the Iranians said they fired two long-range
missiles into Baghdad and 13 short-range projectiles into the ports
of Basra and Umm Qasr, an Iraqi naval base. They also reported
bombing Basra and Umm Qasr and the northern Iraqi city of Erbil.
   IRNA said Iranian warplanes attacked Iraqi troop concentrations
in Al-Amara, north of Basra, and areas in the southern front.
   The U.N. talks between Perez de Cuellar and Larijani were the
fourth round since the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution
July 20 calling for a cease-fire in the war.
   The issue of chemical warfare dominated the talks.
   Larijani said the Security Council should condemn Iraq for using
chemical warfare and ``prevent this very criminal act.''
   The U.N. team that arrived in Baghdad visited Tehran last week
to investigate Iranian allegations that Iraq used chemical warfare
and killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds in fighting last month.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in a letter
delivered Wednesday to Perez de Cuellar that another team of
investigators should visit the village of Halabja, where the
alleged chemical warfare occurred.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo refused again
Thursday to endorse any of the Democratic candidates for president
and implied that he might not back anyone until the primaries are
over in June.
   ``Who cares what ... Mario Cuomo says?'' the governor told
reporters.
   Cuomo also said he had told candidate Albert Gore Jr. that his
attacks on Jesse Jackson and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
would be ``ineffective'' leading up to New York's April 19 primary.
   Cuomo said he talked to Gore Thursday morning and told the
senator that his criticism of Jackson and Dukakis ``wasn't helping
him.''
   Cuomo said his no-more-attacks message had also been passed
along to the Jackson and Dukakis camps.
   During a lengthy news conference, Cuomo again refused to endorse
any of the Democratic candidates and said ``every day this (an
endorsement) means less because we're getting closer to the
primary.''
   Many New York voters agree. Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist
College Institute for Public Opinion, said a new poll to be
released Friday found that more than 40 percent of likely New York
Democratic primary voters said it made ``no difference'' to them
whether Cuomo endorsed someone.
   Cuomo said he was thinking of not backing any of the candidates
until the primary season ended June 7. As he has in the past, Cuomo
said ``the candidate with a plurality at the end of the process
should be the candidate'' of the party.
   Cuomo said party leaders should rally around the leader at that
point and find enough votes to give him the nomination.
   To help with that process, it might be best to remain neutral
through the primaries, said Cuomo.
   ``You're already committed and for the rest of this thing you're
committed,'' he said of making an endorsement. ``When they look at
the whole scene at the end ... maybe at that point there should be
some force.''
   Cuomo again refused to rule out accepting a draft for the
nomination himself if there was a deadlocked convention.

Tough Kids</HEAD>

   NEW YORK (AP) U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett called on
Catholic schools Thursday to enroll the ``worst 5 or 10 percent''
of public school students and ask state or local government to help
pay for teaching them.
   His proposal, made in an address to the National Catholic
Education Association's 85th annual convention here, was greeted
warmly by Catholic educators but was challenged as unconstitutional
by several leading public education groups.
   Bennett dubbed his proposal ``Project Voluntas,'' Latin for good
will.
   Parochial schools already have done an exemplary job teaching
minority students, who make up 22 percent of their 2.5 million
total enrollment, he told the gathering. But he said Catholic
educators have not been effective in telling outsiders how much
better they've done with difficult students compared with many
public schools.
   ``The challenge is simple,'' said Bennett, a parochial school
product himself. ``Show educators around this country what works.''
   ``Seek out the poor, the disadvantaged, the disruptive, the
dropout, and take them in, educate them, and then ask society for
fair recompense for your efforts,'' Bennett said.
   He said Catholic schools should ask state or local governments
for ``half the price, or two-thirds of the price, or something like
that,'' of whatever it would have cost to teach such students in
public school.
   Governments ``would, I believe, be receptive to constitutionally
sound efforts to pay for the education of such students.''
   But if government can't or won't, Bennett said, ``business and
others in the private sector would surely want to support such a
worthwhile endeavor.''
   ``I think there's a good deal of possibility for it,'' said the
Rev. John Pollard, director of education for the Archdiocese of
Chicago which enrolls 180,000 kindergarten through 12th-grade
students.
   ``We do not subscribe to the absolute separation of church and
state that others who oppose us do. The so-called wall of
separation is not in the (U.S.) Constitution,'' he said.
   But ``Project Voluntas'' was condemned by Gary Marx, associate
executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators: ``Every thoughtful American should be appalled by
the secretary's remarks. He constantly hits people in the public
schools below the belt and they are the ones who are working
hardest to deal with the problems of at-risk youth.''
   Thomas Shannon, executive director of the National School Boards
Association, called Bennett's proposal ``a welcome challenge to
Catholic schools,'' but questioned its constitutionality.
   ``If the Catholic schools are going to do what they are supposed
to do, that is, teach Catholic beliefs in an integrated way
throughout the curriculum, it would be unconstitutional on its
face'' to support such schools with public funds, Shannon said.
   Bennett's proposal is the latest of several he has advanced,
largely unsuccessfully, aimed at expanding educational options
including the private school sector. His ideas have included
tuition tax credits and tuition vouchers that would offer tax
breaks or direct assistance to parents of private school children.
   But with prospects bleak for tax credits or vouchers, Bennett
urged Catholic schools to take the initiative and prove that they
deserve community support.
   Roxanne Bradshaw, secretary-treasurer of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teacher union, dismissed
Bennett's idea as ``a back-door approach to finance private
schools.''
   ``On the one hand, he's saying that money is irrelevant to a
quality education. On the other hand, he's saying the Catholic
schools need more money to educate at-risk children. Which is it,
Secretary Bennett? Does money matter, or doesn't it?'' she said.
   But Bennett said Catholic schools ``have often done more with
less.''
   Citing studies by University of Chicago sociologist James
Coleman, Bennett said the dropout rate among parochial high school
sophomores nationwide is just 3 percent, compared with 14 percent
in public schools.
   Median tuition at Catholic elementary schools is about $700, and
$1,500 for high schools, compared with an average of about $4,500 a
year to educate a child in public school, said Bennett.
   Still, he said, more than 4,000 parochial schools have closed in
the last 20 years, and part of the blame is with Catholic schools
themselves for being reticent in proclaiming their excellence.
   ``I believe that it is in your interest to take up this
challenge,'' Bennett said. ``It is also in society's interest.
Catholic schools shouldn't be closing. And disadvantaged children
should be getting a good education.''

   Federal budget director James C. Miller III
pushed the idea of turning over the Postal Service to private
companies Thursday, as about 100 picketing postal workers accused
him of trying to destroy the U.S. mail.
   New Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, appearing at the same
meeting, opposed the privatization idea and called for greater
discretion for the service to manage its finances and set rates.
Picketers said they had no dispute with Frank.
   Miller and Frank appeared at a seminar sponsored by the Cato
Institute, a conservative policy research organization.
   ``There is no good reason why (the Postal Service) should remain
part of the U.S. government, and no good reason why it should enjoy
a monopoly over the delivery of letter mail,'' Miller said.
   He accused the service of wanting to be a government-protected
monopoly when it comes to letter mail and a federal agency when it
comes to federal subsidies and other benefits.
   Miller denied allegations from the postal unions and others that
his Office of Management and Budget has tried to intrude into
management of the Postal Service, which is an independent
government agency.
   He said his problem is not with the 800,000 postal workers but
with the system which he said is ``not working particularly well
right now.''
   ``If given the opportunity to compete, I'm sure the Postal
Service, including its employees, would do very well indeed,'' he
said.
   ``Miller, Miller, he's a jerk; privatization just won't work,''
chanted members of the American Postal Workers Union, who
obstructed the front door of the hotel where the seminar was held
until police arrived and ordered them to the sides.
   Moe Biller, president of the 365,000-member union, called
Miller's proposal ``cockeyed'' and said it would cause chaos with
the mail and increase costs to the public.
   ``No responsible businessman has advocated privatization,''
Biller said.
   Wearing a sign accusing Miller of betraying postal reform,
Biller stood at the doorway of the seminar room for a few minutes
before the budget director arrived. Biller later followed Miller
into the hotel and shook his hand, saying he wanted to debate him.
   Frank, who took over the Postal Service March 1, said it should
not be operated for profit.
   ``It should be the most efficient, reliable, convenient public
service in the country,'' he said.
   Frank said he senses even among advocates of privatization a
desire to effect only gradual changes.
   ``I sense a desire to go slowly, a recognition that the mail
system, like Humpty Dumpty, once broken, couldn't be put back
together again,'' he said.
   He said that if privatization means eliminating the letter-mail
monopoly, skimming off the profitable segments of the postal
business or busting the postal unions, he opposes it.
   But the postmaster general said he was willing to explore the
idea of privatization that would promote efficiency through more
sharing of the workload with major mailers and more contracting of
non-critical postal services.

   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
on Thursday added his voice to that of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in
suggesting that presidential hopeful Albert Gore Jr. tone down his
negative campaigning.
   Kirk said that Cuomo's suggestions that the Tennessee senator
refrain from further attacks on Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis
``are helpful and are on course as far as I'm concerned.''
   The party chief also said Sen. Paul Simon's decision to suspend
campaigning made the remaining Democratic contests all the more
decisive.
   ``The process is doing what it was designed to do: narrow the
field and pull from the field the strongest possible contender,''
he told a news conference.
   Asked whether he thought Gore would have to quit if he does
poorly in the April 19 primary in New York, Kirk said he did not
wish to ``prejudge the results.''
   On the subject of Gore's attacks on his rivals, Kirk said, ``I
spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep the
debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any negative
campaigning.''
   ``For the most part, we've been quite successful in that regard.
The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. Gore by Gov. Cuomo
just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in
a positive way.''
   On whether Cuomo himself might become the nominee in a brokered
convention, Kirk insisted the Democratic nominee would be chosen
from among the candidates now running.
   ``There is a game going on on the field. That's where the
nominee's going to be chosen from,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Kirk said that Jackson would have ``significant
representation'' on the party's platform committee, regardless of
who eventually becomes the nominee.
   He disputed a reporter's suggestion that Jackson's influence
might result in a more liberal platform than would otherwise be
produced.
   ``The fact that Jesse Jackson is running and doing well is an
important constructive force within the Democratic party and should
not be looked upon as an overwhelming problem,'' Kirk said.
   At the same time, he appeared to temper slightly his earlier
assertion that the party's 1988 platform be kept sparse and bland,
saying the party would not ``sound a retreat from'' issues it had
championed in the past, including the Equal Rights Amendment and
abortion rights.
   Asked specifically about abortion, Kirk said, ``I think our
party has always embraced the rights of privacy, the rights of
individual choice.''
   However, Kirk suggested that the platform would address these
issues in a way that would not be divisive and which would give
Democratic candidates a document ``to run with and not shy away
from.''
   Although Kirk's suggestion last December that the party platform
be kept vague won the support of other Democratic leaders and the
AFL-CIO, it was criticized by a variety of interest organizations.
   Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard, chairman of the platform committee,
said that state and regional hearings will be held on the platform
in the coming months. However, Blanchard said he would not permit
the platform hearings to turn into an ideological battleground.
   ``I'd like to think that someone will read it other than
opponents. I hate to work on something that will collect dust,''
Blanchard said.

<HEAD>New Booklet Shows Declining Rural Population in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's population keeps growing, but its
rural population has shrunk dramatically since the early 1980s, an
Agriculture Department report showed Thursday.
   In 1982, when China reported a population of more than 1.01
billion, a record 803.9 million, or 79 percent, lived in rural
areas. By 1985 the total population was more than 1.04 billion, but
rural residents were down to 662.9 million people, or 63 percent.
   Population figures and many others are included in a new edition
of a USDA publication: ``Agricultural Statistics of the People's
Republic of China, 1949-86,'' by Frederick W. Crook and others of
the department's Economic Research Service.
   The new version expands greatly an earlier statistical report on
China's agriculture issued in 1984, which was the USDA's first
since the communists took charge in 1949.
   Although not likely to make this spring's best-seller lists, the
158-page report is expected to be in great demand from China
watchers and U.S. agricultural traders interested in that
potentially huge Asian market. The first edition in 1984 was 71
pages long.
   The report relies on ``the important, although still incomplete,
agricultural data that China's State Statistical Bureau reported
during 1949-85, with some updates through 1986,'' the authors said.
   Some 126 national and provincial tables of figures are included,
along with an introduction, explanatory notes, references and
suggested readings.
   Various sections include agricultural production; ``inputs''
such as farm machinery, fertilizer and labor; exports and imports;
and consumption and procurement.
   The provincial tables include China's population by region and
province; agricultural areas by crops; hog slaughter; horse and
camel year-end inventory; milk production for cows and goats; and
consumption by peasants.
   Officials said the report may be ordered from: Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402,
or telephone (202) 783-3238.

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Thursday spurned a
Vietnamese official's invitation to the United States to send food
aid to regions where villagers are being asked to search for the
remains of American servicemen.
   ``We are outraged at any suggestion of linking food assistance
with the return of remains,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said. ``As you know, the United States does not provide aid
to Vietnam, and does not plan to do so.''
   The spokeswoman said there was no official Vietnamese request
for food aid and that her response was based on news reports of
comments in Hanoi by Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach after a visit
by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
   Pressler, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, is
exploring the possibility of assisting Vietnam with the U.S. Food
For Peace program. Thach was quoted as saying the United States
might consider offering food to areas of Vietnam where rural people
are asked to find U.S. servicemen's remains.
   The Reagan administration has ruled out U.S. government
assistance to Vietnam as well as formal diplomatic relations, as
long as Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia. The administration
has also accused Hanoi of withholding information that could
resolve what happened to at least some of the 1,700 American
servicemen still listed as missing in Vietnam.
   During an airport ceremony in Hanoi on Wednesday, 27 bodies
thought to be of missing Americans were loaded aboard a U.S. Air
Force transport aircraft for a flight to Hawaii where
identification experts will try to identify the remains.
   Mrs. Oakley welcomed the Vietnamese decision to turn over the
remains, but she declined to judge whether Hanoi's action satisfied
Vietnam's promise last year to do as much as possible to resolve
the cases of missing servicemen.
   The agreement was reached during a mission by retired Gen. John
W. Vessey Jr., a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Under the agreement, the United States promised to encourage
private American organizations to provide relief services to
Vietnamese war victims. The chief effort involves the supply of
prosthetic devices to Vietnamese who lost limbs during the war.

   Scientists have confirmed the presence of
an abnormal protein in normal-looking brain cells in Alzheimer's
disease patients, adding evidence that it may be an early
contributor to the disease.
   Further study may lead to a way of battling the memory-decaying
condition before its effects are irreversible, they said Thursday.
   ``You can imagine how exciting it would be if we had a way of
intervening before there has been much irreversible damage,''
Antonio Damasio, head of the neurology department at the University
of Iowa, said at a news conference.
   There is no known treatment or cure for Alzheimer's disease,
which the scientist said affects nearly 3 million Americans and is
the single most common cause of mental decline in older people.
   The results of Damasio's study, done in collaboration with
Bradley Hyman and Gary W. Van Hoesen of the University of Iowa and
brain chemists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New
York City, were to be published Friday in Annals of Neurology, the
journal of the American Neurological Association.
   Alzheimer's is centered in cells which transmit signals to and
from the memory center in the brain, Damasio said.
   He compared the disease's action to a computer with faulty input
and output lines. That limits the functioning of the computer
``while not doing too much damage to the computer itself,'' Damasio
said.
   The study, done by autopsies on the brains of Alzheimer's
patients, shows that the disease is very specific in the brain
cells it attacks, Damasio said.
   The protein confirmed by the study was previously idenfified and
named A68, by Dr. Peter Davies at Albert Einstein.
   ``It looks like the disease knows its way and is very choosey,''
he said.

<HEAD>Amid Missile Attacks, Iran Ready For Parliamentary Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under the threat of Iraqi missiles and air
raids, Iranians vote Friday for a new parliament that will be a key
factor in determining the course of the Islamic revolution.
   The election of a new 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, will be
vital in determining who will hold power in Iran after the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini dies. He is 87 and reported in poor
health.
   The vote is seen as a test of strength between fundamentalists
who support an Islamic-style capitalism and radicals who favor a
socialist-style economy.
   Iranian leaders fear that Iraq will blitz Tehran and other major
cities with a barrage of missiles to disrupt the elections, and
they have urged Iran's more than 20 million voters to turn out in a
massive show of defiance.
   ``The people will attend the election with God's help, even if
they are under missile attack. I will vote under any
circumstances,'' Khomeni said last week.
   He added, ``The people must beware and choose candidates among
... those loyal to Islam. They must choose their deputies from
among those who have suffered from poverty and are real Moslems,
not those who obey America's Islam.''
   About 1,400 candidates, approved by provincial and city
governors controlled by Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi,
will be running.
   Tha's about 400 more than ran in the last election in 1984.
There will be 30 female candidates. It's the first time women have
run for Iran's parliament.
   It is the third parliamentary poll since Khomeini's 1979 Islamic
revolution toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
   Iranian leaders have said the election will be a crucial test
for the Islamic form of democracy, and the campaigning has shown
sharp differences between rival factions over the future course of
domestic policy.
   The 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war, the country's most pressing
problem, has not figured in the campaigning. Khomeini, Iran's
undisputed patriarch, has decreed that the war will not end until
his adversary, Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, has been toppled.
   The conservatives essentially identify with the religious
fundamentalists, who base their concept on a narrow interpretation
of the teachings of the Koran, Islam's holy book, which protects
private property and free enterprise.
   Their protagonists, seeking tighter state control, are likely to
garner widespread support from the increasingly discontented poor
who have to cope with runaway inflation and a flourishing black
market.
   Cigarettes cost $10 a pack, red meat is about $16 a pound, and
eggs are $8.50 a dozen.
   House Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, one of Khomeini's closest
aides and considered a pragmatist on most issues, is expected to be
reelected along with most of the leading figures in the hierachy.
   But the hardliners, such as Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, are
expected to make some gains, a development that could have
far-reaching effects on the shape of the revolution in the
post-Khomeini era.
   None of the candidates is running on party tickets. The last
formal party, the Islamic Republic Party, which Iran's clerics used
to gain power in the early days of the revolution, was disbanded by
Khomeini last June because it was torn by factionalism.
   The candidates will represent various shades of Islamic and
revolutionary thinking.
   The results may not be known for 10 days, and the new parliament
may not sit until June while a new cabinet is screened and nominees
scrutinized by the deputies.

<HEAD>Nine Candidates In Presidential Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Constitutional Council on Thursday published
its list of candidates for the April 24 presidential elections: one
woman and eight men including President Francois Mitterrand who
leads all public opinion polls.
   The nine candidates each fulfilled the requirement of obtaining
the signatures of at least 500 elected officials and payment of a
$1,750 fee.
   French elections are run in two rounds. If no candidate wins an
absolute majority in the April 24 first round, as expected, a
run-off will be held on May 8.
   There is little doubt that the 71-year-old Mitterrand, seeking a
second seven-year term, will win the largest number of first-round
votes. Polls show him with about 38 percent. The real race is for
the second runoff spot, a battle between conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac and former center-right premier Raymond Barre.
   Polls indicate that Mitterrand would easily defeat either
Chirac, 55, or Barre, 63, in the second round. Many voters say,
however, that they are undecided.
   Chirac, who trailed Barre in the early stages of the campaign,
since has overtaken him and now is shown in the polls winning about
24 percent of the vote and Barre about 15 percent.
   Farther back is Jean-Marie Le Pen, 59, leader of the extreme
right National Front, with about 10 percent, depending on the poll.
   Others in the race are Andre Lajoinie, 58, official candidate of
the Communist Party, at about 6 percent, and Pierre Juquin, 58, a
former Communist Party Poliburo member now leading a splinter
reform movement, who has about 3 percent in the polls.
   Also on the list are the ecologist candidate, Antoine Waechter,
39, with about 2{ percent, Arlette Laguiller, 48, head of the
Trotskyist Worker Struggle movement, 1 percent, and Pierre Boussel,
67, leader of the new extreme left Movement for a Party of Workers,
who hasn't turned up in any polls.
   Mitterrand was elected May 10, 1981, defeating incumbent
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   Mitterrand's popularity, which fell to as low as 27 percent at
midterm, has soared in the two years since he no longer has had
direct control over the government.
   The two leading conservatives, Chirac and Barre, have agreed not
to attack one another so as not to split the right, and to support
the top conservative vote-getter in the second round.
   Mitterrand, who has abandoned most of his Socialist rhetoric and
taken pains to distance himself from the party he founded and led
for many years, has moved toward the center. That has turned the
campaign debate largely into a contest of personalities.

<HEAD>Reagan Writes Letter to President of Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has sent a letter
to President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon, expressing concern about the
continuing conflict in the war-torn country, an administration
source said Thursday.
   This official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he
had not seen the letter, but ``I would characterize it as
underscoring the mutual interests that the United States and
Lebanon have in building peace in the region.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk declined to discuss
Reagan's letter to Gemayel, saying: ``We do not comment on any
private presidential communication'' to another head of state.
   April Glaspie, the U.S. ambassador-designate to Iraq, conducted
a shuttle mission between Syria and Lebanon last month in an effort
to mediate a compromise over conflicting power-sharing demands.
   In Washington, a State Department official, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States was ``serving as a
postman between Assad and Gemayel,'' who have not spoken to each
other in over a year.
   Syria, which maintains about 25,000 troops in eastern Lebanon
and in Beirut, is seeking an arrangement that would grant the
country's Moslem majority more power in government. Gemayel, who
heads Lebanon's Christian community, has rejected Syria's
interference.
   The United States has been concerned that unless some agreement
is worked out, this summer's elections would result in serious
factional violence.
   U.S. officials have rejected speculation that the State
Department's mediation is designed to score points with Syria in
return for its help with gaining the release of American hostages
held in Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   A sixth-grader has done in a few
months what critics say state leaders have been unable to do for
years: solve West Virginia's financial problems.
   Keeling Fife Jr. did it as a school social studies project.
   Fife, who became concerned last fall when he heard news stories
about the state's growing financial woes, said his solution
involves changing the ``gross state product'' by increasing the
percentage of workers employed in industry.
   His project won the Wood County Social Studies Fair and is
entered in the May 20 state contest. Fife was last year's state
fair winner.
   ``West Virginia is in a desperate time, and it will take
patience and tough decisions to bring the state back to prosperous
times,'' the 11-year-old said.
   He suggests building hydroelectric dams, training workers in
high-technology fields and lowering the costs of natural resources
for in-state users.
   By 1990, Fife said, the northeastern United States won't have
enough electric power, and hydroelectric plants on West Virginia's
rivers easily could generate power and help the state.
   West Virginia also needs technically literate workers to attract
industries to the state, he said.
   Included in Fife's research, along with newspaper accounts of
the state's indebtedness and legislative performance, are responses
from area legislators and an interview with state Auditor Glen
Gainer.
   ``Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't turn the Legislature over
to the sixth-graders of the state,'' said Fife's father, Keeling
Fife Sr.
   The younger Fife, however, has no intention of becoming a
legislator. He says he prefers collecting baseball cards, playing
baseball and taking piano lessons.
   He doesn't limit his problem-solving to social issues. He also
was a winner in this year's county science fair with a project on
lasers and was a regional math field day winner.

   Rep. Edward P. Boland, author of the
amendments which barred U.S. aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, is
retiring after 36 years in Congress.
   ``I've decided to call it a day,'' the 76-year-old Democrat said
Thursday at a news conference attended by several dozen of the kids
from his sand-lot baseball league _ now retired judges, mayors,
district attorneys, and city and county officials _ who helped
launch his political career 54 years ago.
   ``The parades are all over. The give-and-take of the campaign
trail no longer beckons and the time has come when the bell tolls
on a career that has been for me an exhilarating and fulfilling
experience,'' said Boland.
   He had never lost an election since gaining the state House of
Representatives at age 22.
   Boland was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee from
1977 to 1985. He was a member of the Iran-Contra Committee, whose
hearings produced ``some of the longest days and in some ways some
of the most unpleasant of my life.''
   The Reagan administration's frustration with the Boland
Amendments inspired the diversion of profits from arms sales to
support the Contras. That operation became a focus of the
Iran-Contra investigation and the recent indictment of former
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North and others.
   Boland came to Washington with the man who would later become
the speaker of the House, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, in 1952. For
more than 20 years, the two friends roomed together in an
arrangement they described as a real-life ``Odd Couple'' with
Boland, the neat and tidy half of the pair.
   Boland did not endorse a potential successor. Springfield Mayor
Richard Neal, former Mayor Theodore Dimauro, state Rep. Kenneth M.
Lemanski of Chicopee and state Sen. Robert Wetmore of Barre have
all indicated an interest in the Democratic nomination.

<HEAD>US Soybean Producers Facing Heavy Competition From Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World demand for high-protein, oil-rich
soybeans has led other producing countries into a fierce
competition with American farmers, an Agriculture Department report
said Thursday.
   Soybeans have the potential to supplement diets of low-income
people in the Third World, where it will be important to gain
consumer acceptance for soybeans and soy-fortified foods, said Gary
Vocke, an agriculture and trade analyst in the department's
Economic Research Service.
   ``A historical view shows that U.S. dominance of world soybean
trade, founded on U.S. research and development in the 1940s and
1950s, declined in the 1980s as South American countries, spurred
by high prices, developed large-scale production and processing
facilities,'' he said.
   Brazil and Argentina have been the main U.S. competitors in the
international soybean market.
   Vocke added: ``Their success, mainly in temperate areas, has not
been duplicated in tropical areas elsewhere in the Third World.''
   The major factors behind the increased demand for soybeans in
the Third World are rising incomes and population growth, Vocke
said. As families have more to spend, their demand increases for
meat and other food products such as margarine and cooking oil.
   ``Fierce export competition with the South Americans for these
markets, as well as the developed country market, will likely
continue,'' Vocke said. ``The expansion of large-scale soybean
production in South America will continue as long as soybean prices
are high enough for Brazilian farmers to profitably open new lands
for soybeans.''
   Further encouragement would be in the Brazilian government's
willingness to develop the rural transportation system connecting
the new lands to ocean ports, he said.
   ``If the price of soybeans is high relative to other crops,
farmers in Brazil, Argentina and elsewhere will find it profitable
to switch even more of their existing cropland to soybeans,'' Vocke
said.

   Pat Robertson is pursuing delegates to
the Republican National Convention even though he has given up a
serious contest for the GOP presidential nomination, Robertson
campaign officials said Thursday.
   Robertson has decided not to campaign in the New York primary,
dismissed his Secret Service protection this week and has scaled
back his public appearances, said Barbara Gattullo, a spokeswoman
for Americans for Robertson.
   ``We did not mean to set off any alarm bells by this,'' she said.
   She later said, ``We are going to the convention whether we add
delegates or not.''
   The Secret Service agents are no longer needed because ``we are
traveling about two to three days a week instead of the seven days
a week we were prior to Super Tuesday,'' she said.
   Since his poor showing in the March 8 primaries, Robertson has
cut his staff from 200 to about 50, reduced his campaigning to
those states that choose delegates by caucus rather than primary,
and turned his attention from 1988 to 1992.
   Ms. Gattullo said Robertson had two rallies scheduled in
Virginia Thursday night and Friday and would fly to Georgia on
Saturday for campaign stops over the weekend. She said he would
also make campaign appearances in California and Ohio.
   ``We are absolutely in this through the convention,'' she said.
   Robertson has estimated he will go to the New Orleans convention
in August with 150 delegates. So far, he has 17.
   Since his campaign was derailed during the early March
primaries, when he failed to win any state including his native
Virginia, Robertson has shifted his emphasis from an attempt to
broaden his base of support beyond the religious right to targeting
delegates chosen by caucus.
   With those delegates, he said he will be able to bring a
``strong conservative message'' to the convention. That message
would include the adoption of a national platform that supports
prayer in school, the strengthening of the American family, and
opposition to abortion.

<HEAD>Test Fails To Determine Whether Rape Occurred, Governor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Genetic tests have failed to determine
whether Gary Dotson committed a rape that his accuser now maintains
never happened, Gov. James R. Thompson said Thursday.
   The test, conducted on semen on underwear belonging to Cathleen
Crowell Webb, may mark the end of attempts to prove whether Dotson
actually committed rape in 1977, Thompson said.
   ``At some point, the integrity of the judicial system demands
that the proceedings come to an end, and this may be the end,''
Thompson said.
   Dotson, 30, now being held for parole violation, had served six
years of a 25- to 50-year prison term when Thompson commuted the
sentence in 1985 following Mrs. Webb's recantation to time served.
   Thompson said he was not convinced that Dotson was innocent, and
Dotson's attorney requested that the DNA test be conducted on a
pair of semen-stained underwear Mrs. Webb was wearing when she was
assaulted.
   Thompson said Thursday that tests at the University of Leicester
in Great Britain failed to shed new light on the case.
   Dr. Alec Jeffreys, who conducted the tests, said semen that
stained a pair of underwear worn by Mrs. Webb ``was too degraded
for analysis'' to determine whether it was Dotson's.
   Jeffreys said another type of test might be effective, but
Thompson said he was not sure of the credibility of that test and
suggested that he was ready to close the books on the case.
   Dotson's attorney, Thomas Breen of Chicago, declined to comment
on the governor's statements.
   The test used by Jeffreys analyzes genetic material unique to
each person. In the Dotson case, he sought to compare DNA from the
semen on the underwear to genetic material in a sample provided by
Dotson.
   Jeffreys said he believed the DNA samples recovered from the
panties had degenerated largely because the evidence was stored at
room temperature from 1977 to 1985. He noted that the DNA test
became available only recently.
   During televised hearings before the Illinois Prisoner Review
Board in 1985, Mrs. Webb, now of New Hampshire, recanted her
earlier testimony that Dotson had raped her.
   He is being held at the Joliet Correctional Center on a parole
violation after being arrested Dec. 26 and accused of shoving a
cook and stabbing her in the hand during a quarrel in a bar.
   In February, the state Prisoner Review Board ordered Dotson
imprisoned until Aug. 16, when he could be paroled if he undergoes
alcoholism treatment and complies with other conditions set by the
board.
   Under the good-behavior terms of the commutation, Dotson also
could be forced to serve out the sentence imposed in the rape case.

trespassing and released after an all-day sit-in to protest alleged
racism at the University of California-Berkeley.
   The peaceful protest by about 50 members of the African Students
Association ended Wednesday when campus police cited 18 students
who refused to leave the campus housing office at the close of the
work day.
   ``This protest is the culmination of a lot of different things
that have gone unresolved at the university,'' said ASA President
Michael Stoll.
   The protest focused on charges by freshman Traci Morris, who
claims she's been harassed by three white male dorm-mates who
allegedly damaged her bicycle. Morris also said she had suffered a
year of racial slurs and jokes.
   ``They say things like, `Only 27 percent of you pass anyway, why
study?''' Morris said, referring to a 1987 study which indicated
that 27 percent of black students at the university graduate.
   The protesters demanded the three men be expelled and that
Morris be refunded her housing expenses for the school year.
   University spokesman Ray Colvig said the white students will be
disciplined.
   ``The Office of Student Conduct did a rapid and thorough
investigation and has drawn up a proposed settlement,'' he said.
The agreement involves payment by the men for the damage to the
bicycle, moving the students to other dorms and requiring them to
perform some community service.
   ``I don't know about anything else, all I did was hang her bike
in the shower because she's my friend,'' said Tony Sanchez,
identified as one of the students. He called the incident a
practical joke.
   Freshman Jeffrey Wisher, also named by the ASA, admitted he hung
Morris' bike in the shower a second time. ``But it was only the
bike, it has nothing to do with racism,'' he said.

<HEAD>FCC Dismisses Five Indecency Complaints Against Broadcasters</HEAD>

double entendre,'' contain material that may be offensive to some
readers''</NOTE>

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday dismissed five indecency complaints, including one against
a television station that aired a sex-education program for
teen-agers and another against a radio station that apparantly
aired a reading of James Joyce's ``Ulysses.''
   In four of the cases, the FCC said the material involved did not
violate the agency's decency standards. It said thre fifth case did
not contain sufficient information to determine the context of the
material aired.
   A complaint filed against KING-TV, Seattle, cited a program
called ``Teen Sex, What About the Kids?'' which included what the
FCC described as ``frank discussions of sexual topics, the use of
sex organ models and the simulated demonstration of various birth
control devices.''
   In a letter to the Seattle couple who complained, the FCC said
that while the program contained references to sexual and excretory
organs and activities, the references ``in context, were not
`vulgar,' `lewd' or `shocking.' Nor were they made in a pandering
or titillating manner.''
   The FCC judges material to be indecent if it ``depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory
organs or activities.'' The agency also says it will examine the
context of the material.
   The FCC has said indecent material may be broadcast between
midnight and 6 a.m. because there is little risk children would be
in the audience then.
   Obscene material, however, cannot be aired at any time. Such
material is defined as appealing to the prurient interest and
lacking serious artistic, literary, political or scientific value.
   Broadcasters are challenging the FCC's year-old decency
standards in court, charging the guidelines are vague. They say the
commission has refused to identify specific material that would be
deemed indecent under the standards.
   The FCC has said broadcasters should be guided by the decisions
the agency makes in the cases that come before it.
   A complaint against WBAI-FM, a Pacifica Foundation station in
New York City, described portions of an unidentified program that
the FCC said appeared to be a reading from the ``Penelope'' chapter
of ``Ulysses.''
   Assuming the program was a reading from the classic work, the
FCC said, ``we would not expect that the commission would find such
(sexual and excretory) references, dispersed as they would have
been throughout the three-hour reading of this work of literature,
to be patently offensive.''
   Another complaint the FCC dismissed had been filed by the mayor
of North Charleston, S.C., John E. Bourne Jr., against WTMA-AM,
Charleston, S.C., for airing a political advertisement opposing his
proposal to put a clock on the City Hall. Toward the end of the ad,
someone shouts ``clocksucker.''
   The FCC also found the song ``I Want to Kiss Her, But ...,''
aired by WTRG-FM, Rocky Mount, N.C., was not indecent, despite its
use of double entendre.
   ``The lyrics at issue here are not such that they are capable of
only one, sexual meaning. Rather, the lyrics are capable of two
meanings _ one innocent, one sexual,'' the FCC said.
   The commission ruled last April in a case involving New York
disc jockey Howard Stern that double entendre and innuendo could be
deemed indecent when they were mingled with explicit references
that made the material capable of only a sexually explicit meaning.
   The Public Broadcasting Service's series ``Heimat,'' about the
life of three German families from the end of World War I to the
1960s, was the target of another complaint because of scenes
containing sexual activity.
   The FCC said the complaint, filed against WCET-TV, Cincinnati,
did not contain sufficient information to determine the context of
the material.
   Ron Wilson, a WCET executive, said the series that aired on
about 70 PBS stations last October and November contained some
nudity, but he said it was relevant to the story line and the
characters.
   ``Without those scenes a large part of the content would not
have made sense,'' he said.

   Twenty-seven sets of remains believed to be
those of Americans killed in the Vietnam War arrived here Thursday
for identification.
   A military honor guard carried each of the flag-draped
containers from an Air Force cargo plane at Hickam Air Force Base.
Following military honors, the remains were taken to the Army's
Central Identification Laboratory.
   Military officials said that after positive identification is
made and the families are notified, the names will be released.
   The Vietnamese provided a list of names for at least half the 27
remains, according to Lt. Col. Paul Mather, head of the U.S.
casualty team which received the remains in Hanoi earlier this week.
   It was the largest transfer of remains since the last American
forces withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973.
   U.S. officials list 1,767 Americans as missing in action in the
Vietnam War. Vietnam so far has returned 152 remains that the Army
laboratory has confirmed as those of Americans missing in action.

   The world changed for the Marukis when they left
their small plot of land near Tokyo for Hiroshima three days after
it was destroyed by an atomic bomb.
   For millions born after 1945, the devastation of Hiroshima is
history. For Iri and Toshi Maruki, it was a revelation that led to
the creation of murals depcting the horrors of war.
   The two are subjects of the film ``Hellfire: A Journey from
Hiroshima,'' produced by filmmaker John Junkerman and nominated for
a 1988 Academy Award as best documentary feature.
   Maruki, born in Hiroshima 86 years ago, and his wife, 76, went
to Hiroshima on Aug. 9, 1945, the same day an atomic bomb was
dropped on Nagasaki, to check on family members.
   He had lost his father, uncle, two nieces and numerous friends
in the inferno, which killed an estimated 130,000 people.
   Both say the death and destruction left by the bomb remains a
living memory.
   ``How can we forget?'' Maruki said. ``The horror is always in
our mind. The stench of death was in our nostrils for three or four
weeks.''
   He and Mrs. Maruki were interviewed Thursday at the
Massachusetts College of Art, which is displaying some of their
works _ powerful ink canvases including some of the ``Hiroshima
Panels,'' ``Auschwitz,'' and ``The Battle of Okinawa.'' The two are
scheduled to receive honorary doctorates from the college.
   Titled ``Surviving Visions,'' it is the first Maruki exhibition
in the United States since 1970.
   The artists, who spent a month in the devastated city, describe
this work as ``a procession of ghosts, with hands held before them
... (who) pushed on, dragging their burned bodies, falling and
piling into one another, groaning and dying.
   ``One lone child slept innocently, with unburned skin,'' they
write in a an exhibit catalog. ``Perhaps it survived, sheltered by
its mother's breast.''
   One of the ``Hiroshima Panels,'' ``Ghosts,'' completed in 1950,
depicts some of the dead and dying, naked, their bodies charred,
their faces anguished.
   ``Death of American Prisoners of War'' is a 1971 canvas
depicting a tragedy that was taboo in Japan for decades, the
massacre of 23 U.S. POWs by enraged survivors of the bombing.
   ``We trembled as we painted the death of the American prisoners
of war,'' Mrs. Maruki wrote.
   The victims' manacled corpses are intertwined with erotic nude
figures of their wives and lovers back home. A dark, menacing mass
of enraged Japanese crowds the periphery of the drawings.
   ``Auschwitz'' resulted from a trip to the former death camp in
Poland, where 3 million Jews and other inmates were gassed or
starved to death by the Nazis. Completed in 1977, the work's eight
somber panels pay tribute to Holocaust victims and survivors.
   The Marukis said their art educates generations born too late to
experience the horrors of World War II.
   ``The kids don't know because they're not taught in school,''
said Mrs. Maruki, suggesting that Japan still was reluctant to come
to grips with a painful period in its history. ``I suspect that the
Ministry of Education is somehow maneuvering not to teach (this)
modern history to children.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists have confirmed the presence of
an abnormal protein in normal-looking brain cells in Alzheimer's
disease patients, adding evidence that it may be an early
contributor to the disease.
   Further study may lead to a way of battling the memory-decaying
condition before its effects are irreversible, they said Thursday.
   ``You can imagine how exciting it would be if we had a way of
intervening before there has been much irreversible damage,''
Antonio Damasio, head of the neurology department at the University
of Iowa, said at a news conference.
   There is no known treatment or cure for Alzheimer's disease,
which the scientist said affects nearly 3 million Americans and is
the single most common cause of mental decline in older people.
   The results of Damasio's study, done in collaboration with
Bradley Hyman and Gary W. Van Hoesen of the University of Iowa and
brain chemists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New
York City, were to be published Friday in Annals of Neurology, the
journal of the American Neurological Association.
   Alzheimer's is centered in cells which transmit signals to and
from the memory center in the brain, Damasio said.
   He compared the disease's action to a computer with faulty input
and output lines. That limits the functioning of the computer
``while not doing too much damage to the computer itself,'' Damasio
said.
   The study, done by autopsies on the brains of Alzheimer's
patients, shows that the disease is very specific in the brain
cells it attacks, Damasio said.
   The protein confirmed by the study was previously idenfified and
named A68, by Dr. Peter Davies at Albert Einstein.
   ``It looks like the disease knows its way and is very choosey,''
he said.

<HEAD>States Try To Get EPA To Move on Acid Rain Reductions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine states and four environmental groups
renewed their attempt Thursday to persuade the Environmental
Protection Agency to order reductions in emissions of the
pollutants that cause acid rain.
   The states asked EPA to publish for public comment two
procedural findings made by the agency under President Carter just
before he left office: That acid rain originating in U.S. pollution
endangers the environment in Canada; and that Canada grants the
United States the same rights to protest air pollution there that
Canada has to protest air pollution here.
   The Canadian province of Ontario filed a similar petition of its
own, said Jim Hecker, a Washington lawyer representing the province.
   Those findings must be made before EPA could order the states to
require reductions in the precursors of acid rain. Then-EPA
Administrator Douglas Costle announced those decisions in early
1981.
   In a case brought by eight of the states and Ontario, a federal
appeals court said the findings, to be valid as a starting point
for further action, had to be published as draft agency regulations
to give the public a chance to comment on them. The Supreme Court
declined to intervene.
   In asking for quick action _ within 60 days _ on the grounds
that the substance of the question had been decided for years, and
indeed affirmed in statements by various officials including
President Reagan, the states said, ``These elementary decisions do
not involve identification of sources or responsible states, or the
prescription of emission reductions or other remedial actions.''
   In the Reagan administration, EPA has resisted doing anything
about Costle's letter on the grounds that not enough was known
about acid rain to tell the states what to do, or even specify
which states should be targeted. The administration has agreed with
Canada to spend $2.5 billion, matched by industry, to speed the
commercialization of cleaner methods of burning coal.
   In earlier proceedings, the plaintiffs said EPA should order
emission reductions in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee, West Virginia and Illinois.
   Acid rain results from the conversion of oxides of sulfur and
nitrogen emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels into sulfuric
and nitric acids in the atmosphere. Though there are many
contributors, sulfur dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants
and factories is major source of the acid precursors.
   Many environmentalists blame acid rain for acidifying lakes and
streams in the Northeast and in eastern Canada to the point that
fish cannot live.
   In a parallel case, many of the same states are trying to force
EPA to order other states upwind of them to require emissions
reductions from sources within their borders to enable the downwind
states to fulfill their own air pollution control plans. That case
will be argued for the second time later this month before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   Thursday's petitioners were Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
Minnesota, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club,
the Izaak Walton League and the National Audubon Society.

   Federal agencies involved in housing,
hamstrung by a lack of congressional guidance, are doing little or
nothing about the threat from cancer-causing radon, the General
Accounting Office said Thursday.
   Although environmental officials say radon causes up to 20,000
cancer deaths a year, the housing agencies see little
responsibility to respond, the GAO, an investigative arm of
Congress, said in a report.
   The report scrutinized the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the Veterans Administration, the Farmers Home
Administration and the National Park Service.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who requested and released the
year-long GAO study, called its results ``disturbing.''
   ``While millions of Americans are at risk, federal bureaucrats
... sit on their hands,'' said Lautenberg, who chairs the Senate's
environmental oversight subcommittee.
   Radon is a naturally occurring, odorless and colorless gas. The
Environmental Protection Agency says radon may cause from 5,000 to
20,000 lung-cancer deaths annually.
   A byproduct of decaying, underground uranium, radon rises from
the ground and can seep into buildings. Trapped indoors, the gas
poses health threats that can far surpass heavy smoking or
inordinate exposure to X-rays.
   The GAO noted that EPA was assigned by Congress to lead the
attack on radon. So far, it said, ``much work remains'' on EPA's
acceptable, but slow-moving strategy.
   Lautenberg asked the GAO to evaluate the radon response by
federal agencies who administer housing or subsidize home ownership.
   Investigators found an overall lack of response, ``ranging from
responding to a few site-specific problems to not being involved
with indoor radon at all,'' the report said.
   Officials of the housing agencies are largely unaware of radon
problems. and are uncertain whether they have any legal
responsibility, it said. Courts appear unlikely to hold federal
agencies liable in cases arising from radon, it added.
   The report said that while EPA's radon mandate is clear,
Congress has said nothing to HUD, the VA or FmHA. In addition, it
said, the agencies are further confused by the lack of an EPA
standard for how much radon is too much.
   GAO said the HUD secretary and EPA administrator should meet to
``define their respective responsibilities and planned actions.''
Congress, meanwhile, could consider specifying how it wants other
agencies to deal with radon. it said.
   The report's poorest grades went to HUD, which administers the
home mortgage insurance program and subsidies for public and Indian
housing. It said ``HUD has reacted to radon hazards in a limited,
piecemeal manner.''
   Department spokesman Bill Glavin said HUD has no overall radon
policy, but has reacted to specific cases of suspected pollution.
   The VA, which administers a guaranteed and insured loan program
for veterans buying homes, has ``no radon policy and essentially is
not involved with the issue,'' the GAO said.
   VA spokesman Bonner Day said the agency, in backing mortgage
loans, generally defers to state law on housing construction and
safety standards.
   The GAO's highest grades went to the FmHA, which lends mortgage
money in rural areas. According to the report, FmHA has trained its
field workers in radon measurement and mitigation, and is at work
on an overall policy.
   FmHA spokesman Ron Ence said, ``We've been on top of this for
several years.''
   Only the Park Serice, which operates housing for visitors and
staff, has pursued comprehensive radon testing at those dwellings
and its administrative buildings, the GAO found.

   A meltdown at the Tarrant County
Convention Center left Disney's World On Ice in puddles and
hundreds of tiny Mickey Mouse and Snow White fans out in the cold.
   After a Tuesday opening that attracted more than 6,000 fans,
convention center officials had to cancel two performances
Wednesday when a blown fuse allowed the 80- by 200-foot rink to
melt.
   Disney characters _ including Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy,
Sneezy, Dopey and Bashful _ got an unscheduled day off.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Melvin Morgan, executive director of
the convention center. ``This has never happened to us before _ or
to them.''
   Greg Ericson, regional marketing director for the show,
estimated ticket sale losses ``anywhere from $40,000 to $200,000. I
think there may be some kind of insurance covering this, but I'm
not positive.''
   Morgan said convention center workers first noticed the blown
fuse had jammed a pump that is part of the ice-making refrigeration
system late Tuesday. But they didn't think the problem was serious.
   By Wednesday morning, most of the rink had turned to slush.
   A mechanical firm fixed the pump and fuse Wednesday afternoon,
but it took seven hours to freeze the half-inch of ice required for
the show.
   Morgan and Ericson said tickets for the canceled shows would be
honored at any of the remaining performances in Fort Worth and
shows next week in Dallas, or they can be turned in for a refund.

   The report said there were seven child abuse fatalities in

   Jurors acquitted 13 white supremacists
Thursday of charges including conspiring to overthrow the federal
government and to kill a federal judge and FBI agent.
   The all-white jury returned the verdict in its fourth day of
deliberations, a day after U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold
refused to accept the panel's statement that it was deadlocked on
two of the counts.
   The defendants included three leaders of white supremacist
groups: Louis Ray Beam Jr., 41, of Houston; Robert E. Miles, 63, of
Cohoctah, Mich., and Richard G. Butler, 70, of Hayden Lake, Idaho.
   Asked how the seven-week trial affected the white supremacist
movement, Miles said, ``Who knows? What movement? What's left of it
after this?''
   U.S. Attorney J. Michael Fitzhugh said he thought the government
had proved its case but ``we accept the verdict of the jury.''
   Nine defendants were charged with seditious conspiracy, accused
of wanting to overthrow the government and start an all-white
nation in the Pacific Northwest. Five were accused of conspiring to
kill the federal officials, and two also were charged with
transporting stolen money across state lines.
   Six of the defendants are already serving prison terms for other
crimes.
   The jury reached a verdict Wednesday on the charge involving the
judge and FBI agent, but Arnold ordered it sealed until
deliberations were complete.
   The government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored
trucks of $4.1 million, including about $1 million that still is
missing.
   The defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key
government witness, James Ellison, 47, who led a supremacist group
in Arkansas and now is serving 20 years for racketeering.
   ``The government was going to send a message to the movement.
The movement sent a message to the government. The message was the
same one God told pharoah, `Let my people go,''' said Thom Robb,
the national chaplain of the Ku Klux Klan, who hugged several of
the defendants after the verdict was announced.
   Fitzhugh said it was not a political trial. ``We weren't after
them for what they believed or what they said, but what they did,''
he said.
   He declined to say whether any investigations of a similar
nature are under way and said he did not know the cost of the trial.
   Beam celebrated his acquittal by going to a Confederate memorial
opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he
called the ``Zionist occupation government.''
   ``There are over 150 other political prisoners being held in
ZOG's jails that need to be freed,'' Beam said.
   ``I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today. I think
everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being
punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.''
   Beam's wife, Sheila, fainted and was carried a block to an
attorney's office by her husband.
   Maximum penalties for conviction would have included 20 years
and a $20,000 fine for seditious conspiracy, life for conspiracy to
murder, and 10 years and a $10,000 fine for transporting stolen
money.
   The trial started Feb. 16.
   In addition to Beam, Miles and Butler, the defendants included:
   Richard Joseph Scutari, 40, of New York, already serving 60
years after being convicted of racketeering in a trial in Seattle.
   Bruce Carroll Pierce, 32, of Metalline Falls, Wash., serving 100
years from Seattle for racketeering and 150 years after being
convicted in Denver of violating the civil rights of radio
personality Alan Berg by murdering him.
   Andrew Virgil Barnhill, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., serving 40
years for racketeering.
   Ardie McBrearty, 60, of Gentry, Ark., serving 40 years for
racketeering.
   David Eden Lane, 48, of Denver, serving 40 years for

<HEAD>Officials Concerned About Delvalle's Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's top aides voiced
concern Thursday about the safety of deposed Panamanian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle and stressed that the United States recognizes
him as the Central American country's rightful leader.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker and national security
adviser Colin Powell said the United States continues to maintain
contact with Delvalle in the wake of the arrest warrant issued
against him in Panama.
   ``Delvalle, as far as the government of the United States is
concerned, is the lawful president of that country,'' Baker told
reporters, ``and we'll be greatly concerned if General (Manuel
Antonio) Noriega were to attack the vested authority of Panama, and
we will watch that very carefully.''
   Baker and Powell, staying at an oceanside hotel not far from the
mountaintop ranch where President Reagan is vacationing, said they
were still checking out some aspects of the move by Noriega to have
Delvalle arrested.
   Delvalle has been in hiding since Feb. 26, when he was toppled
from power following a failed attempt to fire Noriega as chief of
the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Baker and Powell, who were traveling to Rancho del Cielo later
Thursday to brief Reagan on Panama, Afghanistan and other issues,
said they put no stock in reports that Delvalle, frustrated over
Noriega's continued grip on power, was considering giving up his
quest to reassume power.
   ``I've had no indication of that,'' Baker said. And Powell said,
``No, in fact his representatives have said that is not the case.
He is still very much the president of Panama. We recognize him as
such. We know of no plans on his part.''
   Delvalle's wife, Mariela Delvalle, had said Wednesday that her
husband received assurances from the United States of new steps to
dislodge Noriega.
   Asked about that Thursday, Powell replied, ``I'm not going to
describe what options we may have under consideration or what our
conversations have been with President Delvalle.''
   Baker said ``we're fully prepared to deal with'' contingencies,
but he did not elaborate.
   Asked whether he thought Delvalle was in an increasingly
perilous position because of the warrant, Powell said, ``I don't
believe that is the case, but of course we are in touch with him
and we are concerned about his security and we will be in touch
with him, make sure he is satisfied with his security.''
   Powell also said ``we have channels open'' to Noriega, but said
that ``I'm not going into any detail as to what those channels are
or what might be passing (through them).''
   Panamanian government prosecutor Alvoro Visuetti announced on
television Wednesday night that arrest warrants had been issued
against Delvalle; Gabriel Lewis Galino, a former Panamanian
ambassador to the United States, and Juan B. Sosa, Delvalle's
ambassador to Washington, who remains in the U.S. capital.
   The warrant against Delvalle accuses the deposed president of
crimes against the state and the nation's economic security.
   Powell would neither confirm nor deny Thursday a report in the
Los Angeles Times saying that an interagency task force has
recommended that Reagan invoke the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (IEEPA) to stop payments by U.S. businesses and
individuals to Panama or any of its governmental agencies.
   Powell, in response to questions, said he did not rule out the
possibility that Reagan would invoke the seldom-used law
authorizing the U.S. government to seize tax payments and other
monies.
   ``I said we had IEEPA under consideration and we had not made a
decision on that.''
   The United States has slapped a variety of economic sanctions on
Panama already, including the freezing of its assets in the United
States and the withholding of payments to the Panama Canal
Commission.
   But administration officials have been showing growing
impatience with the fact Noriega remains despite the economic,
political and military pressure brought against him.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Contras Discuss Technical Details of Truce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandinista and Contra military
delegations on Thursday discussed technical details of providing
humanitarian aid to the rebels and controlling zones where the
insurgents are to gather during a cease-fire.
   A spokeswoman for the Contra umbrella organization, the
Nicaraguan Resistance, said Thursday the rebels were refusing to
discuss giving up their arms.
   The talks were at the southern border town of Sapoa, where the
two sides reached a cease-fire accord on March 23. That agreement
requires them to reach a permanent truce to end the nearly
7-year-old war that the leftist government says has claimed more
than 26,000 lives.
   The two delegations decided Wednesday on the number and location
of the zones where the rebels will gather during the 60-day
cease-fire. It went into effect last Friday, although all the
details were not worked out.
   President Daniel Ortega warned Wednesday that the Sandinistas
would launch an offensive against the Contras if they fail to
comply with the March 23 accord.
   Under that agreement, the rebels said they would gather in the
cease-fire zones while their leaders negotiated a more permanent
truce. In exchange, the Sandinistas have pledged to carry out
democratic reforms.
   But the Sapoa talks have been marked by mutual distrust and
differing interpretations of the vaguely worded plan.
   Still unresolved were pledges of security for the Contras inside
the cease-fire zones, how they would receive food and other
supplies, who would control the areas and how compliance would be
verified.
   Marta Sacasa, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, said
the rebels at the Sapoa talks were refusing to discuss the delicate
issue of the Contras laying down their weapons.
   The March 23 accord does not mention disarming, something the
Contras vow they will never do, Ms. Sacasa said in a telephone
interview Thursday from Miami.
   The Sandinistas claim that surrendering of weapons is implicit
in the agreement and essential for peace.
   Meanwhile, pro-government newspapers Thursday described as
``false'' a document circulating in the capital said to be from the
ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   The document, marked ``secret,'' appears to have been written
earlier this year and outlines party strategy.
   According to the document, Sandinista troops should stage an
offensive along the Honduran border to rid the area of Contras and
their supply bases.
   Such an offensive, it argues, would oblige Honduras to accept
the presence of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the border
area.
   ``The incursions by our troops into Honduras in pursuit of the
mercenaries will surely provoke imperialist reactions, which we
have to watch but not fear,'' the document said.
   The Sandinistas did carry out an offensive against the Contras
in the northern border area in March.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras charged that Sandinista
forces had entered his country's territory while chasing the
rebels. President Reagan responded by sending 3,200 U.S. troops to
Honduras for two weeks of exercises. Ortega denied his troops had
entered the neighboring country.
   The document also noted House Speaker Jim Wright's opposition to
the Reagan administration's policies towards Nicaragua.
   It called Wright, D-Texas, the head of a ``parallel power that
has enabled us to tie the hands of the (Reagan) administration.''
   Ortega said Thursday his government sent a letter of protest to
the Organization of American States denouncing a reported offer by
Honduras to allow Contra supplies from the United States to arrive
there.
   Speaking in a radio interview, Ortega said Honduras made itself
an ``instrument of American policies'' by acting as an ``illegal
springboard for supplies for the mercenary forces.''

   White House chief of staff Howard
Baker on Thursday defended the propriety of President Reagan's
secret leasing arrangement for a $2.5 million estate and said the
first family ``may not like'' all the publicity about the deal.
   The White House refuses to say how much Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, are paying for the three-bedroom, six bath home in the
exclusive Bel Air section of Los Angeles that has a heated swimming
pool and three-car garage.
   Real estate sources estimate the monthly rent at $12,000 to
$15,000, based on fair-market value.
   Moreover, it is unclear why the Reagans are leasing the home
instead of buying it outright. Also unknown are the identities of
the 18-20 people who formed a consortium specifically to buy it for
the Reagans.
   The Reagans are planning to move into the home, at 668 St. Cloud
Road, after he leaves office next Jan. 20.
   The 1\-acre property, in the poshest area of Bel Air, touches
the Kirkeby estate where the ``Beverly Hillbillies'' television
series was filmed and is located near the homes of Elizabeth
Taylor, Zsa Zsa Gabor and other celebrities, as well as some of the
Reagan's closest friends.
   Baker rejected the notion that there was any impropriety in the
deal.
   Responding to reporters' questions at the seaside hotel where he
is staying during Reagan's vacation, Baker said, ``The White House,
the president and the first lady went to great lengths to make sure
that this was an arms-length transaction, that there was a full
appraisal of the rental price of this property and that all of the
i's were dotted and the t's were crossed.''
   Baker said, ``The president and the first lady have handled this
in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism
of the transaction.''
   Asked if the Reagans were upset by publicity about the house, he
said, ``Oh, I don't think so. I think after eight years they've
come to understand that that occurs, and while they understand it,
they may not like it, but they are not angry about it.''
   A White House statement released Wednesday said the Reagans'
three-year lease took effect March 1, and contained an option to
renew or purchase. No purchase price was specified in the lease,
the White House said.
   Before buying the property, the prospective owners sought an
opinion from the Office of Government Ethics on the propriety of
leasing or selling the property to the Reagans.
   The opinion said the Reagans would comply with standards of
conduct regulations and conflict-of-interest statutes if they paid
a fair-market rental or purchase price for the house, the White
House said.
   It said the lease terms were negotiated by representatives of
the owners and the Reagans, based on fair-market value rental
estimates from two independent appraisers.
   In Washington, Donald Campbell, deputy director of the Office of
Government Ethics, confirmed that lawyers representing the
consortium approached the agency in July 1986 and ``we did make an
analysis of it'' and provide an informal opinion letter.
   Eighteen people were listed in the consortium, all but one
described by the lawyers as friends of the Reagans for a number of
years, Campbell said.
   Presidents are not required to adhere to the standards or to
federal conflict-of-interest criminal laws, but traditionally have
committed themselves to doing so.
   The property was purchased in August 1986 by the consortium,
which has incorporated itself as Wall Management Services Inc.
   Realtor Jeff Hyland of the Los Angeles firm of Alvarez, Hyland &
Young said that with rising prices since the purchase, the land
alone now is worth $3 million.
   ``They got a great buy,'' he said. ``The bought it for land
value. As far as I'm concerned, they got the house for free.''
   Realtor John Aaroe of the Jon Douglas Co. said the house, built
in 1954, still has the original kitchen and bathrooms and needs
updating and renovations.

<HEAD>Simon Suspends Campaign But Holds Delegates</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Moves up grafs 15-18 pvs to grafs 9-12 to raise Simon comment

   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon suspended his stalled
presidential campaign Thursday but held onto his 170 delegates in
hopes of influencing the choice of a nominee at the Democratic
national convention in July. Jesse Jackson immediately blasted
Simon for keeping the delegates, saying many of them were
rightfully his.
   ``In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows
what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' Simon
told a news conference. ``There will be many encounters with fate
before the contest is ultimately decided in a wide-open
convention.''
   In a quasi-withdrawal, Simon said he would no longer actively
campaign for the nomination but said he technically would remain a
candidate even though he conceded he has ``no illusions that the
nomination will come my way.''
   ``I want to have an impact on who the party nominates,'' Simon
said. ``I want to have an impact on the whole process there (at the
Atlanta convention), and on where we go.''
   Jackson, however, said Simon's move was a less-than-honorable
one, and that he ought to release his delegates.
   ``If one is not in the race one ought to indicate a form of
honorable withdrawal at which time whoever got second place in that
state will get those delegates. That's what Mr. Gephardt did. It
was the honorable and the fair thing to do,'' Jackson said in New
York.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt dropped out of the Democratic race last
month.
   ``I would hope that in time Mr. Simon likewise _ now that he has
made the decision to leave the race _ will leave so honorably, and
hide behind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which
in fact belong to me,'' Jackson said.
   Simon's decision to nominally remain a candidate and retain his
delegates means he holds onto 47 at-large delegates won in the
Illinois primary. Had he formally withdrawn from the race, those
delegates would have gone automatically to Jackson, who finished
second in Illinois.
   Asked whether his move could be seen as an effort to deprive
Jackson of support, Simon said, ``I am sure it is not perceived by
Jesse Jackson as a stop-Jackson effort.'' He said he had spoken to
Jackson and the other two remaining Democratic candidates _
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. _ about
his plans.
   Simon said he would keep a lock on the 170 delegates he has won
and an aide said he hoped to perhaps attract a few more by the time
the party's last primaries end on June 7. At that point, Simon
said, he will meet with the delegates and decide what to do next.
   ``I owe something to those delegates,'' he said. A total of
2,082 delegates is needed to nominate a candidate.
   Simon showed early strength in the Democratic campaign,
finishing a close second in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.
But he dropped to third in New Hampshire and failed to rebound as
the primary season wore on, except for a lone win in his home
state. His bid bottomed out Tuesday in Wisconsin, where he finished
last with just 5 percent of the vote.
   He blamed his campaign's precipitous decline on a failure to
effectively communicate his message of traditional Democratic party
values, and on a lack of money, but said he did not see his failure
as a rejection of those values.
   ``I do belive we have to have a government that cares, and the
American people believe that, too _ that I know,'' he said to the
cheers of supporters who packed a Senate hearing room where he made
his announcement.
   ``I really believe the American people are ready for a candidate
who says let's put unemployed people to work, let's have quality
schools for this nation,'' he said.
   But Simon said he still is concerned, as he said at the outset
of his campaign a year ago, that the Democratic Party could
``become a clone'' of the Republican Party by forgetting its past.
   ``We can't build the kind of nation we want if we simply pander
to the wishes of the rich and powerful,'' he said.
   Simon, 59, stayed true to his liberal background during the
campaign. With his trademark bow-tie and claim to the plain-spoken
legacy of Harry Truman, he said often that voters were ``ready for
something other than the slick, packaged product.''
   He proposed long-term health care for the elderly, a public
works program for the unemployed and new education initiatives, and
promised that as president he would balance the budget in three
years. But critics questioned how he could reconcile promises to
set up expensive new programs while also claiming to be a fiscal
conservative who would balance the budget.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for three of four defendants charged
in the Iran-Contra case moved Thursday to dismiss the indictment on
the ground that prosecution evidence is illegally based on their
testimony to Congress.
   Lawyers representing former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and businessman Albert Hakim
contended that some of the evidence prosecutors used to obtain the
23-count indictment last month came from testimony the three gave
to the House and Senate Iran-Contra committees.
   Poindexter, North and Hakim testified under grants of limited or
``use'' immunity from prosecution that prohibits independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh from using their answers to congressional
questioning as evidence against them.
   Even though Walsh tried to insulate his staff and grand jurors
from publicity surrounding the hearings, ``given the widespread
dissemination of immunized testimony throughout our society, the
broad use of immunized testimony has been inevitable, undeniable
and so pervasive that the indictment must be dismissed as a matter
of law,'' the defense lawyers said.
   They asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to hold a
hearing to determine whether grand jurors, prosecutors and
investigators on Walsh's staff relied on the immunized
congressional testimony.
   ``Never in the history of this nation has the immunized
testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all major
networks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' said the
written request.
   The defense contended that use of that congressional testimony
or information derived from it ``has been and will be used against
them in many ways in this prosecution, in violation of their rights
under the Fifth Amendment.''
   North, Poindexter, Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord were charged with conspiring to divert proceeds of the
U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when
Congress banned American military aid to the rebels.
   Lawyers for Secord, who brokered the arms deals with Hakim and
testified on Capitol Hill without use immunity, charged in a
separate motion that Walsh illegally ignored congressional
testimony of North and Poindexter that would vindicate their client.
   ``The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorial
convenience above General Secord's Fifth Amendment right to a fair
and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and
requires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictment
be dismissed,'' Secord's lawyers said in their brief.
   Secord tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to force the grand
jury to consider North and Poindexter's congressional testimony.
Both men told Congress that Secord was acting as a U.S. government
agent, a point the defense says should have been made to the grand
jury before he was indicted.
   Walsh is expected to respond in court pleadings on Friday. The
independent counsel must prove that he insulated his staff and
grand jurors from the publicity surrounding the hearings.
   Gesell has scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday to explore the
issues sketched out in the defense brief.
   Before the congressional hearings got under way last spring,
Walsh rushed many witnesses through the grand jury and filed
evidence he had obtained under court seal to prove it was obtained
independently of the congressional testimony.
   Among other things, the defense asked Gesell to question
individual grand jurors to determine if they learned of the
immunized congressional testimony from friends, relatives or news
reports.
   The hearing should also determine whether or not grand jurors
were exposed to immunized testimony from witnesses who testified in
the grand jury.
   The defense said it planned to challenge the legal authority of
former federal judge Herbert Stern to represent Walsh's office on
the immunity issue. Stern was retained by Walsh as an outside
counsel so that prosecutors on the independent counsel's staff
would remain insulated from the congressional testimony.
   Defense lawyers contended Stern lacks legal authority to
represent the U.S. government under the disputed independent
counsel law or the Justice Department regulation that Walsh
received to counter constitutional challenges to the special
prosecutor statute.

<TEXT>
   Fighting raged for the third day in a
showdown for dominance in south Lebanon between Shiite Moslem
militias allied with Syria and Iran. Police said 39 people were
killed and 96 wounded.
   Casualties for the three days stood at 51 dead and 130 wounded,
according to police figures
   The battle is between Justice Minister Nabih Berri's mainstream
militia Amal, supported by Syria, and Hezbollah, or Party of God,
which is loyal to Iran.
   It continued despite repeated cease-fire appeals from the
highest Shiite clerics. That may indicate Syria wants to crus
Iran's challenge to its role as the main power broker in Lebanon,
where the Syrians have 25,000 troops.
   A police spokesman said Amal units with armored personnel
carriers advanced about noon into the coastal town of Ghaziyeh, a
key Hezbollah stronghold.
   By nightfall, Amal recaptured the village after ``ferocious
house-to-house fighting,'' police reported. They said most of the
day's casualties occurred in Ghaziyeh, five miles south of Sidon,
the provincial capital of south Lebanon.
   Amal said its fighters had captured and disarmed several
Hezbollah militiamen.
   ``With the recapture of Ghaziyeh, Amal has established
undisputed control over the whole of south Lebanon as well as the
main coastal highway,'' which links the predominantly Shiite south
to the rest of Lebanon, the communique said.
   Trouble between Amal and Hezbollah began Feb. 17, when Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, the U.S. Marine who commands U.N. truce
observers, was kidnapped near Tyre and Amal rounded up dozens of
Hezbollah members it accused of involvement.
   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the
22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, who include nine Americans. Held
longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The police spokesman said Amal had seized 11 towns and villages,
and Hezbollah fighters remain entrenched in three hamlets in
addition to Ghaziyeh.
   Hezbollah issued a statement in Sidon accused Amal of stopping a
convoy of international and Lebanese Red Cross vehicles that
carried three wounded Hezbollahis from south Lebanon for treatment
in Beirut.
   ``The assailants forced all Red Cross personnel out of the
ambulances and then raked the vehicles with gunfire, killing the
three wounded men on their stretchers,'' the statement said.
   Amal denied involvement in the attack, whichoccurred after
nightfall near the village of Aaqbiyeh, 12 miles south of Sidon.
   Police confirmed the attack without reporting the politics of
the assailants or victims. They said no Red Cross personnel were
hurt.
   The attack by Amal on Ghaziyeh ``obviously aims at stripping
Hezbollah in south Lebanon of its main supply line,'' said the
police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations.
   The road to south Lebanon has been blocked at Ghaziyeh since
Wednesday, when Hezbollah fighters overran an Amal checkpoint in
the town.
   The spokesman said Hezbollah's 40 fighters in the village of
Kfar Roumman surrendered to Amal a few hours after Amal seized the
adjacent town of Nabatiyeh in a ``sweeping attack.'' Nabatiyeh, 18
miles southeast of Sidon, is a mainly Shiite town of 50,000.
   An Associated Press reporter saw six Hezbollah fighters, their
hands up, emerging from a gutted house in Nabatiyeh's old sector
and surrendering to Amal militiamen.
   Fighting for Nabatiyeh was fierce. The two sides traded
rocket-propelled grenades and mortar rounds until Hezbollah's last
stronghold at the town's Christian school fell to Aamal attackers.
   The school, occupied by Hezbollah when the confrontation broke
out Tuesday, was devastated with its walls peppered with shell
holes, blown-out windows and fire-blackened wooden desks.

<TEXT>
   A major rift appeared Thursday in the
opposition to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is getting tough
with critics in defiance of the U.S. economic squeeze and a buildup
of American forces in Panama.
   Two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own
anti-government movement. Their leaders argued that the economic
sanctions are hurting Panama's people more than they are damaging
Noriega and the civilian government he controls.
   Roberto Arosemena and Mauro Zuniga, leaders of the Popular
Action Party, announced formation of the Popular Civic Movement in
a break with the National Civic Crusade, an alliance of about 200
organizations that has led the 10-month-old effort to oust Noriega.
   They told a news conference their movement also is backed by the
Authentic Panamanian Party, the largest opposition political party.
   Washington has supported the Civic Crusade in its effort to
remove Noriega as chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, which
include the military and police. Noriega is under indictment in the
United States on drug trafficking charges, which he denies.
   Zuniga said the new movement rejects any U.S. influence.
   ``For us, no recipe that comes from Washington has been
favorable to the Panamanians,'' he said. ``The people of the world
know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals, the
United States and the Soviet Union, never are favorable to the
interests of the people.''
   He added: ``It is absolutely necessary for Gen. Noriega to
abandon his post. For us, this is fundamental.''
   Leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations, strikes
and other protests of the Civic Crusade, while differing with some
of its policies and generally favoring a harder line.
   Popular Action, for example, refused to join the Crusade,
Authentic Panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to a
proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the Roman
Catholic church.
   Political parties linked most closely with the Civic Crusade are
the Democratic Christians and the Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement, known as Molirena.
   Those two parties, the Crusade and the United States all
recognize deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the
constitutional head of state. Popular Action and the Authentic
Panamanian Party do not.
   Noriega orchestrated the ouster of Delvalle on Feb. 26, the day
after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   Zuniga, brother of a former Popular Action presidential
candidate, said the movement ``will center its fight on the
original principles of the Civic Crusade.''
   He and Arosemena denied its creation amounted to a split with
the Civic Crusade, but rejected a proposal for dialogue with the
government mediated by Marcos G. McGrath, the Roman Catholic
archbishop.
   They also demanded an end to U.S. economic sanctions, which some
Civic Crusade leaders have said should be strengthened, and opposed
the idea of U.S. intervention.
   ``The United States should not continue economic and military
action against Panama,'' Arosemena said. ``The Panamanian people
are capable of solving their own problems.''
   The last of 1,300 additional U.S. soldiers arrived Thursday at
Howard Air Force Base outside Panama City, completing a buildup
meant to provide greater security for the Panama Canal, American
installations and U.S. citizens.
   Late Wednesday, the government said it had issued arrest
warrants for three leading opponents, including Delvalle, who has
been in hiding in Panama.
   It also asked Interpol, the international police organization,
to arrest Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a former ambassador to the United
States, and Juan B. Sosa, who was Delvalle's envoy in Washington
and remains there.
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday the United
States ``would regard any efforts by the Noriega regime to attempt
arrests or prosecutions of President Delvalle and the others for
their activities in urging and supporting U.S. sanctions as the
unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime.''

   The Reagan White House on Wednesday
urged illegal aliens eligible for amnesty to take advantage of a
citizenship offer that expires May 4.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement that
Reagan ``urges those who may be eligible to attain this privilege
and benefit to do so promptly.''
   Fitzwater's statement noted that more than 1.25 million illegal
aliens have come forward to seek legal status under the ``general
amnesty'' clause of sweeping immigration legislation Reagan signed
a little more than a year ago.
   Among the law's amnesty provisions are requirements that the
applicant be free of a criminal record and have lived in the United
States continously since before 1982.
   Fitzwater's statement took no notice of a bill approved March 31
by the House Judiciary Committee that would extend the May 4
amnesty application deadline to Nov. 30.
   The spokesman said that among the more than 1 million aliens who
have applied so far for citizenship are people comprising nearly
every nationality.
   ``By their actions in this country over the past six years, they
have demonstrated that they deserve the privilege of remaining here
in a fully legal status, without having to live in an underground
society and fearing discovery of their unlawful existence,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``But the time to apply for citizenship under this `amnesty'
provision will end on May 4, 1988,'' it said. ``There may still be
those who for one reason or another have not taken advantage of
this onetime opportunity.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``calls on all Americans to do whatever is
in their power to remind their neighbors, friends, co-workers and
others, who may be living outside our immigration laws ... that the
time is growing short for them to come forward and join us as
recognized members of our nation and society.''
   Immigration and Naturalization Service figures show that besides
the more than 1.25 million general amnesty applications, there have
been roughly 300,000 applications for citizenship under a separate
program for farmers and farm workers.
   Of the applications that have reached the decision stage, only
12,700 have been rejected and 782,000 have been approved.
   The remaining applications are in the clearance pipeline at INS.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts 16 Political Figures</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with another state senator indicted.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special grand jury investigating
political corruption indicted 16 Mingo County political figures
Thursday, including two state senators, three former House of
Delegates members, the county prosecutor and Williamson's mayor.
   Also indicted were two county commissioners, a current and
former magistrate, one former and two current county school board
members, and the former county and circuit clerks, a spokesman in
the circuit clerk's office said.
   State Sen. Truman Chafin, a one-time Democratic candidate for
governor, was indicted on a felony count of bribery for allegedly
accepting money when he was a county commissioner as part of a
scheme to sell the sheriff's job for $100,000. Chafin was indicted
separately from the other 15.
   All others were charged in a 10-count indictment with various
violations of state election laws, as well as with a felony count
of conspiracy. The indictment alleges that they ``associated
together with Johnie M. Owens and others to improperly affect and
influence the free election system and the law enforcement system
of Mingo County.
   Sen. John Pat Fanning, also a Democrat, was indicted on two
counts of bribery, one count of conspiracy and one count of filing
false accounts _ all felonies _ and one count each of making
political contributions exceeding the state limits and failing to
report political expenditures, both misdemeanors.
   Chafin and Fanning both were reported to be out of their offices
late Thursday afternoon and were unavailable for comment.
   Also named as defendants are Mingo County Prosecutor W. Thomas
Ward, county school board members Paul Sizemore and Robert
Simpkins, former Delegates James B. Simpkins, Irvine K.O. Damron,
and R. Doyle Van Meter II, County Commissioners Ronnie Rumora and
Steve Adkins, former Mingo County Magistrate Joey Kohari,
Magistrate Bill Webb, former Circuit Clerk Robert J. ``Jack'' Webb,
former County Clerk Hugh Wellman, Williamson Mayor Sam Kapourales,
and Larry Hamrick, a former school board member and former director
of the county's anti-poverty agency.
   Also indicted Thursday was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used car
dealership at Delbarton owned by former county commissioner and
county Democratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was not named
in the indictment.
   Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in Mingo
County Circuit Court.
   All charges pertain to the 1984 election, except for two counts
that involve the 1986 election.
   Last week, grand jurors heard testimony from candidates in the
1984 and 1986 primary elections, including Fanning, Damron, James
B. Simpkins and Van Meter.
   Also appearing before the grand jury were United Mine Workers
Local 1440 President Bill Davis and Wally Warden, editor of the
Williamson Daily News.
   The newspaper has extensively covered the state and federal
probes in Mingo County, and Warden provided jurors with background
on the makeup of campaign slates in past elections and with
information on precincts that have been the site of voting
irregularities.
   Davis reportedly was questioned about campaign contributions and
financial support from COMPAC, the UMW's political action committee.
   The grand jury has indicted several current and former Mingo
County officials, including Sheriff Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert, in
connection with the sale of the sheriff's office in 1982 for
$100,000.
   Owens and Runyon have pleaded guilty in that matter and will be
sentenced April 18, the same day Hilbert is scheduled to enter a
plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors. Adkins is awaiting
trial.

<HEAD>Gore Told to Tone It Down; Simon Quasi-Quits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2nd graf on Gore ignoring tone-it-down message</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert Gore Jr. got a message from two Democratic Party
heavyweights on Thursday to tone down his criticism of presidential
front-runners Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, while Sen. Paul
Simon put his campaign on hold but kept his delegates in pocket.
   But Gore ignored the message, making fresh attacks as he
campaigned in New York.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, one of the Gore critics, implied he
might withhold his sought-after endorsement and said, ``Who cares
what ... Mario Cuomo says?''
   Cuomo said he told Gore that his negative campaigning ``wasn't
helping him'' in New York ahead of that state's April 19 primary.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. endorsed Cuomo's
appeal to the Tennessee senator. ``The admonitions that have been
addressed to Sen. Gore by Gov. Cuomo just help to make sure we can
continue to talk about the issues in a positive way,'' Kirk said in
Washington, D.C.
   But Gore consultant David Garth, a sometime adviser to Cuomo,
took exception to the governor's comments. ``Big chief, big
blanket, sends up big signal _ like make nice and roll over,''
Garth said, adding that he assumed Cuomo was trying to help Dukakis
win New York.
   Simon, who managed only a primary victory in his home state of
Illinois, said he would suspend campaigning, but refused to release
his 170 delegates in hopes of influencing the national convention.
   ``I want to have an impact on who the party nominates,'' Simon
told a Capitol Hill news conference. ``I want to have an impact on
the whole process there (at the Atlanta convention), and on where
we go.''
   Simon added that he had ``no illusions that the nomination will
come my way.''
   But Jackson didn't appreciate Simon's near-withdrawal. As the
runnerup to Simon in Illinois, he stood to gain the lion's share of
47 at-large delegates if Simon quit cleanly.
   ``If one is not in the race one ought to indicate a form of
honorable withdrawal at which time whoever got second place in that
state will get those delegates,'' Jackson said, adding that the
Illinois at-large delegates ``in fact belong to me.''
   The remaining Democratic trio addressed the New York State
Democratic Meeting, the Irish-American Forum and the Democracy
Project as they sought support from New York officials. The state
holds its primary on April 19 with 255 delegates at stake.
   Gore, under attack for criticizing his rivals, charged the
Dukakis campaign with fueling a ``stop Jackson'' movement.
   ``I fear that in other camps something else is going on behind
the scenes,'' Gore told the Democratic meeting. ``Last week the
Wisconsin director of the Dukakis campaign, Pat Forceia, was quoted
publicly as saying, `A vote for Gore is a vote for Jackson.' ... In
my opinion that kind of politics is insulting to Jesse, insulting
to me and insulting to the Democratic Party.
   ``Let me make one thing clear: A vote for Gore is a vote for
Gore, and if the Dukakis campaign wants to start a stop Jackson
movement, I want no part of it,'' he said.
   Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign manager, said that earlier in
the campaign it was the Tennessee senator who used similar tactics.
   ``In South Carolina, Gore said a vote for anybody but him was a
vote for Jackson,'' said Austin. ``So if the shoe fits, wear it.
He's worn the shoe before.''
   Cuomo skipped the state party meeting and stayed in the state
capital to deal with a budget crisis. Cuomo found time, however,
for a lengthy news conference in which he refused to endorse any of
the Democrats and implied he might stay mum until the primaries end
in June.
   ``Every day this (an endorsement) means less because we're
getting close to the primary. Who cares what ... Mario Cuomo says?''
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis said Cuomo's endorsement would still
be relevant, and indicated that he had spoken to the New York
governor Thursday morning.
   ``People in New York and across this country care very deeply
about what Gov. Cuomo thinks and what other governors think. As I
said the other day, that is the decision that he has to make.''
   Jackson weighed the possibility of meeting with Jewish leaders
in New York to allay their fears about his Arab sympathies.
   ``Sometimes you can't beat your head against the wall. You have
to walk away from the wall,'' said Austin, who is Jewish.
   On the Republican side, a spokesman for Pat Robertson's campaign
said he would continue to pursue delegates through the GOP
convention even though he has given up a serious run for the
nomination.
   Robertson let go his Secret Service protection because ``we are
traveling about two to three days a week instead of the
seven-days-a-week we were prior to Super Tuesday,'' said Barbara
Gattullo, a campaign spokeswoman.
   But she added: ``We are absolutely in this through the
convention.''

<TEXT>
   Gunmen who killed 28 peasants at an
Easter festival also tracked down eight survivors and murdered
them, a Bogota radio station reported Thursday.
   Station RCN quoted national police sources as saying drug
traffickers were responsible for the massacre of the 36 people last
Sunday at Mejor Esquina, a village in the northwestern state of
Cordoba.
   It said the information was included in a police report to the
defense minister, Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina. The national police
are part of the military.
   Drug traffickers attacked the village because it allowed a
leftist guerrilla group to use it as headquarters for extorting
money from ranchers in the area, RCN reported, quoting the national
police.
   Narcotics dealers had bought many of the ranches and were among
those from whom money was demanded, the radio said.
   The hooded gunmen opened fire on peasants as they danced at an
Easter festival and shot others as they lay face down in a hut.
Among the dead were two boys 10 and 14 years of age. At least 10
people were wounded.

<HEAD>High Wind, Rain Along Mid-Atlantic Coast, Heat Wave in Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm packing powerful winds swept across the Atlantic Coast
on Thursday, drenching an area from Maryland to New Jersey, while
temperatures climbed to record levels in the northern Plains.
   Rivers swelled to near flood stage in Indiana, Ohio and
Michigan, where basements in Delta Township, in south-central
Michigan, were flooded after heavy rain Wednesday.
   The storm produced a record wind gust of 172 mph Wednesday night
on Grandfather Mountain, in western North Carolina. Winds of 69 mph
and gusts to 115 mph were recorded Thursday morning.
   The mid-Atlantic states also had strong winds Thursday, with a
gust of 48 mph at Baltimore and 44 mph at Wrightstown, N.J. A gust
of 46 mph was recorded at Atlanta.
   Gale warnings were in effect for Atlantic coastal waters from
New Jersey to Delaware and from South Carolina to northern Florida.
   Rain was widespread Thurdsay afternoon across Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 0.78 inch at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Md., 0.74 inch at
Salisbury, Md., 0.65 inch at Dover, Del., 0.63 inch at Washington,
D.C., 0.60 inch at Harrisburg, Pa., 0.56 inch at Millville, N.J.,
and 0.53 inch at Philadelphia.
   Flood warnings were posted along St. Joseph River in southern
Michigan, northern Indiana and northwest Ohio. The river was
expected to crest at up to 3 feet above flood stage during the next
couple of days, causing flooding of lowlands and secondary roads.
Similar flooding was expected along the Kankakee River in northwest
Indiana.
   Warm temperatures prevailed in the Plains, where readings were
in the 70s and 80s in the Dakotas, eastern portions of Wyoming and
Colorado.
   Temperatures reached record highs in Duluth, Minn., 66; Fargo,
N.D.; 76; Minot, N.D., 80; Rapid City, S.D., 82; and Sioux City,
Iowa, 85. Records were tied in Aberdeen, S.D., 85, and Scottsbluff,
Neb., 82.
   To the northwest, a cold front sent temperatures in western
Montana down to the lower 40s. A winter storm watch for possible
heavy snow was in effect overnight for the mountains of
south-central montana.
   In the desert Southwest, temperatures were in the 80s and lower
90s by midday, and a wind advisory was posted for the deserts of
southern California and southern Nevada.
   A high-wind warning was in effect in extreme western Nevada,
where a gust of 61 mph was recorded at Reno late Thursday morning.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees at Mullan,
Idaho, to 92 degrees at Yuma, Ariz. The morning low was 21 degrees
at Yellowstone Park, Wyo.
   Friday's forecast called for rain from North Carolina across the
mid-Atlantic states to New England, showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the Dakotas across the Nebraska Panhandle and
southeast Wyoming to Colorado, rain and mountain snow in Wyoming,
southeast Idaho and Utah, rain and snow showers in Montana, and
scattered showers in southern Texas.
   Highs temperatures were expected to climb into the 80s from the
lower Mississippi Valley across the central and southern Plains to
the desert Southwest, into the 40s or 50s from North Carolina to
New England and across the central and northern Appalachians to the
Great Lakes, into the 40s and 50s from western portions of the
Dakotas to the Pacific Northwest and into the 60s or 70s elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's campaign organizers in Georgia
expressed concern Thursday over comments by some of the state's top
Democrats that Jackson cannot win the presidency.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, Gov. Joe Frank Harris, and Georgia House Speaker
Tom Murphy, all Democrats, recently said they do not believe
Jackson, if nominated by their party at the national convention
here in July, can win the election in November.
   ``Yes, it does concern me _ it concerns me that politicians of
whatever race automatically discount the electability and the
credibility of other political candidates,'' said Decatur Mayor
Mike Mears, co-chairman of Jackson's Georgia campaign.
   Jackson's other co-chairman, state Sen. Eugene Walker, said
party leaders had assured him that Jackson's Super Tuesday showing
would be properly reflected in the allocation of at-large delegate
slots to be filled in May.
   But, Walker added, ``we're providing the commensurate work and
diligence to ensure that we get those things.''
   Jackson led the field in Georgia's March 8 Super Tuesday
primary, capturing 40 percent of the vote and 36 of the 77
delegates at stake.

<HEAD>Koch Fears He Won't Be A Delegate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Thursday he may not be
a delegate to the Democratic National Convention because he favors
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo for president.
   Koch said he would like to be an uncommitted delegate so he
could work to draft Cuomo, who is not running for the nomination.
   However, he said, 15 percent of the voters in the April 19
primary must cast ballots for ``uncommitted'' to empower the state
Democratic committee to send uncommitted delegates _ such as Koch _
to the convention.
   The mayor has balked at backing one of the candidates, even
though his commitment would end after the first ballot.
   ``I'm not going to endorse before the convention because I still
want Cuomo,'' he told reporters. ``I think it would be unfair for
me to endorse someone other than Mario Cuomo ... and then desert
them at the convention.''

<HEAD>Dukakis' Comment Sounds A Lot Like Koch's Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Worcester Telegram says Michael
Dukakis is using a line about charisma and competence that sounds a
lot like one used a decade ago by Edward I. Koch.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor running for the Democratic
presidential campaign, has responded recently to comments that he
is on the dull and boring side by saying that ``after eight years
of charisma, maybe it's time for a little competence.''
   The Telegram said Thursday that in 1977, when Koch was running
for mayor of New York City, he asked: ``After eight years of
charisma and four years of the clubhouse, why not try competence?''
_ a reference to the terms of Mayors John Lindsay and Abe Beame.
   But Koch apparently is not disturbed by Dukakis' failure to
attribute the quote, the newspaper said, and it quoted Koch aide
Larry Simonberg as saying, ``We're not charging for the slogan''
and adding ``it doesn't bother him the least. He's aware of it.''
   Mark Gearan, spokesman for the Dukakis campaign, agreed the
quote was similar to the one used by Koch but he said there was no
deliberate attempt to steal it. ``I think by any measure it was
total happenstance,'' he said.

   Four variations of the winter's most prevalent
flu type have been circulating in the United States, and that could
pose a tricky question for researchers trying to concoct next
winter's flu vaccine, health officials said Thursday.
   The 1987-88 vaccine did not protect patients against the various
viruses as well as it could have against the single virus expected
to predominate, said Suzanne Gaventa, a researcher with the
national Centers for Disease Control.
   ``There have been people coming down with influenza who did
receive the vaccine,'' Ms. Gaventa said.
   Although the current flu season is winding down, some activity
continues, the CDC said. New York, Connecticut and New Hampshire
reported ``widespread'' flu outbreaks last week _ covering areas
including more than half the population.
   Eight other states, Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, reported less severe
``regional'' outbreaks.
   Late last year, as the 1987-88 influenza season began, the CDC
saw evidence of an apparent ``drift'' in the predominant flu type,
which this past winter was the one researchers call Type A-H3N2,
one of three major types of flu.
   The predominant A-H3N2 virus, the CDC said at the time, was
``drifting'' away from the Leningrad flu, the A-H3N2 strain the
1987-88 flu vaccine was designed to stop, and toward a somewhat
different form.
   On Thursday the CDC said it had now identified four different
variants of A-H3N2 flu virus circulating in the United States in
recent months; they are known as the Sichuan flu, the Victoria flu,
the Sydney flu and the Shanghai flu.
   ``Co-circulation of two or more closely related ... variants in
a single season is not uncommon,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said in
its weekly report.
   But the four different viruses present something for CDC
immunization experts to think about, Ms. Gaventa said.
   Each year, the CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee
recommends which flu types the next winter's vaccine should protect
against and which specific strains of those types should be
targeted.
   The reports of the four different A-H3N2 strains circulating
this past winter ``will be used in deciding which H3N2 antigen to
use'' in next winter's vaccine, Ms. Gaventa said.
   ``They'll take this information, along with information provided
from other areas, and put that together and try to determine which
strain is most likely to circulate next season,'' she said.
   A single flu vaccine cannot protect optimally against four
different flu viruses belonging to the same type, she said.
Instead, vaccine experts will try to determine which virus to
target and how much protection that vaccine might offer against
closely related viruses.
   CDC recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and
those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu.
   Type A-H3N2 flu has long been associated with ``excess
mortality,'' the CDC said, and many states have reported outbreaks
of flu-like illness this winter in nursing homes, where patients
might be particularly vulnerable.

   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan said Thursday
agreement is at hand on ending the Afghan civil war and urged that
a formal accord be signed in Geneva so the Kremlin can begin
withdrawing its troops May 15.
   That would be two weeks before Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Reagan begin their summit in the Soviet capital.
Agreement on Afghanistan would resolve an issue that has troubled
relations for nearly a decade, prompting a U.S. grain embargo and
keeping Americans home from the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.
   Gorbachev and Afghan leader Najib issued a joint statement after
meeting in the Soviet Central Asian city of Tashkent.
   ``There is certain to be a signed agreement on political
normalization,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying while he toured a
collective farm near Tashkent after the meeting. ``I think both
Pakistan and Afghanistan will come to agreement, and that we and
the Americans will agree to be guarantors.''
   The joint communique, distributed by the Tass news agency and
read during the nightly news program ``Vremya,'' omitted the usual
criticism of positions taken by Pakistan and the United States at
the Geneva peace talks. This omission could indicate some
behind-the-scenes compromise.
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said the Geneva accords were ready
for signing, but U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez indicated problems
remained.
   ``There are very difficult decisions and the only good thing _ I
think that is important _ is that the political will is obviously
there to take them,'' he told reporters in Geneva after the
Soviet-Afghan statement ws isasued.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla
alliance, said in Islamabad, Pakistan, said it was the ``first step
toward victory'' and a ``defeat for the Russians.'' He said the
guerrillas ``will try to intensify'' the war.
   Draft documents in Geneva call for an end to outside aid for the
rebels and U.S. officials have pressed for ``symmetry,'' a
simultaneous end of Soviet military aid to Najib's government.
   Zia, quoted by Pakistan's official news agency, said:
``According to unofficial reports, the two superpowers have agreed
on the symmetry under which both would be able to provide continued
assistance to their respective allies in Afghanistan.'' No details
of the alleged agreement were given.
   In the United States, administration sources said the
Soviet-Afghan agreement appears to meet U.S. conditions for ending
aid to the warring parties and President Reagan was described by
his chief of staff, Howard Baker, as ``cautiously optimistic.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, addressing the
issue of symmetry, said: ``We have not yet received a response from
the Soviet government on our proposal. Until it's received, we must
reserve judgment.''
   Soviet officials claimed earlier this week that Pakistan,
Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, and the United States were delaying
a settlement. They threatened to make a separate withdrawal
arrangement with the Afghan leadership if the Geneva talks failed.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting in Afghanistan after a
Communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces entered the
country in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 soldiers now are
there to help fight the guerrillas.
   Pakistan is involved in the negotiations because about 3.5
million Afghan refugees live there. Most are in border towns and
camps that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas, who
are armed and trained by Pakistan and the United States.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, was
asked at a news briefing whether there was a U.S.-Soviet compromise
on Afghan aid.
   ``The situation is evolving,'' he said.
   He refused comment about Zia's statement and would not answer
questions about the Soviet-Afghan statement, saying only: ``Let's
let the communique work for itself for a while.''
   Gorbachev and Najib declared in the eight-point communique they
``believe that the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have
now been removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are
involved in the settlement, and favor their immediate signing.''
   They said withdrawal would begin May 15 if the peace package was
signed ``within the shortest period.''
   Their statement praised Cordovez, who has worked to produce a
negotiated settlement of the Afghan war since the Geneva talks
began four years ago.
   It also said Najib ``welcomes the readiness of the Soviet Union
and the United States'' to guarantee adherence to the accords.
   Gorbachev flew to Tashkent, capital of the Uzbek republic, on
Wednesday. Tass did not explain the purpose the trip for more than
six hours, then said Najib and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze also had flown there from Kabul.
   Shevardnadze had spent four days working with Najib on a
withdrawal plan to be implemented in case the Geneva talks failed.

   The Soviet-Afghan agreement under which the
Red Army may start pulling out of Afghanistan by May 15 appears to
meet U.S. conditions on continuing aid to the warring parties,
administration sources said Thursday.
   President Reagan was described by his chief of staff, Howard
Baker, as ``cautiously optimistic.'' But Reagan still ``wants to
see the fine print,'' Baker told reporters in California, where
Reagan is vacationing.
   ``We think an agreement now is clearly within reach,'' said one
administration source in Washington who closely monitors Afghan
developments.
   Administration officials interpreted a statement issued by
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his Afghan ally Najib as
``an indication that they have agreed to our conditions, but we
want to know that authoritatively,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of annoymity.
   The administration is waiting to hear from the Soviets on a
proposal advanced by Secretary of State George P. Shultz on March
31. He said the United States _ under what is being called a
``gentlemen's agreement'' _ would continue its estimated $600
million a year in covert aid to the Afghan guerrillas as long as
Moscow was aiding the Kabul regime.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Thursday that
the United States has not budged from the Shultz formula, which
embodies what diplomats call ``positive symmetry.''
   She said the Soviets had rejected a proposal involving
``negative symmetry,'' in which the two sides would end aid shortly
after an agreement was signed.
   ``Our position is clear,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``Such an agreement
must be a comprehensive settlement that provides for the prompt
withdrawal of all Soviet troops, an independent non-aligned
Afghanistan, self-determination for the Afghan people and the
return of the refugees in safety and honor.''
   Two other administration sources involved with Afghanistan, also
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the next step would be to
seek agreement at the United Nations-brokered talks in Geneva on
formation of an interim Afghan government during the Soviet
withdrawal.
   ``The parties are going to work very hard on the interim
government,'' said one official. ``It is the next item on the
agenda. But it is not clear whether it will be part of the
agreement.''
   The Gorbachev-Najib communique, issued after a surprise meeting
between the two in the Soviet Central Asia city of Tashkent, said
``the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been
removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved
in the settlement and favor their immediate signing.''
   The declaration said the road was now clear for formation of a
coalition government including all political forces in Afghanistan,
``including those who are currently opposed to one another.''
   Many of the guerrillas balked at Najib's previous political
overtures, which he has billed as ``national reconciliation.''
   The administration has seesawed on the question of ending aid to
resistance. The State Department had been pushing for cessation of
aid to the guerrillas within 60 days of an agreement.
   But last December, Reagan said he would continue sending aid to
the Mujahedeen guerrillas until the last of the 115,000 Soviet
soldiers left Afghanistan.
   The Senate, acting on a resolution introduced by Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., urged Reagan in a 77-0 vote to stick to his
guns, and at the beginning of March, the State Department made the
tougher line a formal U.S. position at the Geneva talks.
   The Soviets rejected that, and Shultz proposed ``negative
symmetry,'' or simultaneous cessation of aid, a softer line than
advanced by Reagan in December. But the Soviets rejected that too,
and Shultz proposed ``positive symmetry,'' which was closer to the
positions taken by Reagan last December and the Senate in February.
   Byrd applauded the latest turn of events.
   ``Secretary Shultz has kept me informed of the developments
during the last three weeks of negotiations. From our
conversations, I believe that my concerns have been met. I want to
give this agreement a chance,'' Byrd said in a statement issued by
his office.
   Another lawmaker who has vocally supported the guerrillas, Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., was pessimistic about the chances of the
proposed agreement.
   ``If the option to resupply is not in writing, then the
government of Pakistan (which channels aid to the guerrillas) is
going to find itself in under tremendous domestic and international
pressure to pinch or sever the arms pipeline,'' Humphrey said in a
telephone interview.
   At the same time, the United States greatly increased its covert
arms shipments to the guerrillas, but curtailed shipments of
hand-held Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, according to
congressional sources who closely track the issue.

   The Rev. Lorenzo Zorza, a Roman Catholic priest
wanted in New York on drug trafficking charges, should be tried in
Italy, the investigating judge said Thursday.
   A U.S. official said, however, that Zorza was expected to be
extradited.
   Zorza, 46, is an American citizen who lives in New York City and
was arrested by Italian drug police Wednesday in Bologna. He was
among 39 people charged in Manhattan last week with participating
in a large international heroin and smuggling ring with links to
the Sicilian Mafia.
   Zorza was arrested at the home of an art restorer identified by
police as Adria Gialdini. She and her husband, Vittorio Santunione,
were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting the fugitive and
possession of firearms.
   In announcing Zorza's arrest Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani said in New York: ``The Italian government will turn him
over to U.S. authorities, probably federal marshals, tomorrow.''
   The priest remained in Italian custody, however, and was brought
to Rome for interrogation by investigating magistrate Margherita
Gerunda, who issued the arrest warrant March 29.
   Asked about extradition, the judge replied: ``He was arrested on
a warrant issued by the Italian judicial authority. ... He is
expected to be tried in Italy. The main judicial authority is in
Italy.''
   Judge Gerunda added, however, that there ``might be some
political considerations, perhaps a temporary extradition,''
because Zorza is an American citizen.
   She said charges against Zorza in Italy include associating with
organized crime, criminal association for drug trafficking,
importation of drugs, counterfeiting and illegal exportation of art
works.
   An American official said privately that extradition is expected
``in due course'' but ``first you have to go through all the formal
procedures.''

   Ethiopian rebels accused Ethiopia's
Marxist government on Thursday of trying to starve people by
ordering foreign relief workers out of Eritrea and Tigre, regions
hit by drought and war.
   The government told international relief agencies Wednesday to
recall all their foreign workers in Eritrea and Tigre ``to avoid
personnel security risks'' from rebels.
   In Brussels, Belgium, the European Economic Community said
Thursday it was ``seriously concerned'' about the action.
   A spokesman for EEC's executive Commission, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said ``We are studying the situation. We
are studying what steps to take next. ... Our concern is to have
humanitarian aid delivered.''
   Two-thirds of the EEC's overall, $145 million food aid program
is delivered to about 3 million drought victims through
non-governmental aid agencies.
   Ethiopia asked donors and the relief agencies affected by its
order to turn over their operations to the Relief and
Rehabilitation Commission, the government agency responsible for
drought and famine relief.
   The rebels' clandestine radio station said in a broadcast
monitored in Nairobi, ``The Eritrean People's Liberation Front
calls on all charitable organizations and those cooperating with
them to oppose the dergue's (Ethiopian leadership's) inhuman step
and to help the starving people in any way possible.''
   It said the order was intended ``to starve the people of Eritrea
and Tigre and cow them into submission.
   ``For this purpose, the dergue intends to put the charitable
organizations' food, vehicles and other services to military use.''
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the
central government in Ethiopia in Africa's longest civil war.
   In neighboring Tigre, another separatist group, the Tigre
People's Liberation Front, has been fighting for 14 years.
   The hostilities have disrupted relief efforts in both regions,
where crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation.
Overall, nearly 7 million Ethiopians face famine without outside
help.
   About 60 non-governmental relief organizations operate in
Ethiopia, but only a few operate in Eritrea and Tigre.

   Scholars from around the world gathered on
Thursday to discuss ways to foster black studies on college
campuses and to help the public understand the African perspective.
   The 12th Annual Conference of the National Council for Black
Studies, which runs through Saturday, will include workshops and
panel discussions on topics ranging from the needs of black
students at predominantly white schools to blacks and AIDS in
Philadelphia and the depiction of blacks in the media.
   In keeping with the theme ``The Struggle for Black Minds:
Operationalizing Afrocentricity,'' the 250 scholars attending the
conference will try to find ways to allow others to see the world
from an African perspective, according to Kariamu Welsh, assistant
professor of African Studies at Temple.
   The conference will allow scholars to develop support for
African studies and to examine ways to make the African perspective
relative to all fields, she said.
   Diane Abbott, the first black woman elected to Parliament in
Britain, was scheduled to deliver the keynote address Friday.
   The schedule also includes Doyin Abiola, managing director of
the Concord Publishing Group, who helped break barriers for female
journalists in Nigeria.
   In addition, the conference features Molefi Asante, professor
and chairman of the department of African-American studies at
Temple University. He has written 23 books, the latest being the
controversial ``The Afrocentric Idea,'' which tries to present
African history from an African rather than European perspective.
   The conference is sponsored by the African-American studies
departments of Temple, the University of Pennsylvania and
Pennsylvania State University.

   Jazz guitarist Larry Carlton, who was shot in
the neck at his home by two teen-agers, was moved to an undisclosed
hospital for security reasons Thursday as police puzzled over the
motive for the attack.
   The Grammy Award winner, wounded Wednesday as he arrived at his
Hollywood Hills home, was in stable condition in the new hospital,
said Detective Russ Kuster.
   ``We just suggested routine, everyday security procedures,''
Kuster said, explaining the move from St. Joseph Medical Center in
Burbank, where Carlton underwent four hours of surgery after the
attack.
   Carlton, 40, was conscious in the hospital and described his
attackers as two boys between the ages of 14 and 17 who had a
German shepherd puppy with them, Kuster said. Investigators haven't
been able to determine the motive, he said.
   The shooting took place at 3 p.m. Wednesday, as Carlton arrived
at his home in the exclusive Lake Hollywood area surrounding a
reservoir in the hills 10 miles northwest of downtown.
   ``He walked inside, left the door open,'' Kuster related. ``He
looked outside, saw a little dog and saw a gun pointed at him.''
   Carlton won a best pop instrumental performance Grammy this year
for his version of the Doobie Brothers' ``Minute By Minute,'' and
shared the same award in 1981 with pianist Mike Post for their work
on the ``Hill Street Blues'' theme.
   The musician toured with the Fifth Dimension vocal group during
the 1960s and was a member of the Jazz Crusaders during the early
1970s.

   A fundraising campaign aimed at providing
vaccines to immunize the world's children against six deadly and
disabling diseases was announced Thursday by several celebrities
and two public service organizations.
   ``There are seven children dying every minute somewhere in the
world because of these diseases and an additional seven disabled by
them every minute,'' said Herbert Pigman, director of Rotary
International's immunization task force.
   ``This can all be prevented if only if we can deliver vaccines
in that critical first year of a baby's life _ vaccines that cost
well under a dollar for all six'' diseases, he added.
   Jerry Michaud, executive director of the End Hunger Network
said: ``The goal is to immunize all the world's children by 1990.
We want to get the Hollywood community involved in promoting this
campaign.''
   While no specific monetary goal has been set by the two groups,
Michaud said the funds raised by their ``Chance of a Lifetime''
campaign will be turned over to UNICEF, CARE, Save the Children
Foundation, Project Concern and other reputable groups to deliver
the vaccines to Third World nations.
   The vaccines are those meant to prevent measles, polio,
diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and tuberculosis, which kill 3{
million children and disable another 3{ million each year, Pigman
said.
   Campaign spokesman Alan Feldman said syndicated TV situation
comedy stars attending Thursday's kickoff were Dyana Ortelli and
8-year-old Humberto Ortiz, both of ``Marblehead Manor;''
11-year-old Soleil Moon Frye, of ``Punky Brewster;'' Joyce DeWitt,
of ``Three's Company;'' and 11-year-old Taliesin Jaffe, of ``She's
The Sheriff.''
   Chris Templeton, who suffered polio and stars in CBS's ``The
Young and the Restless'' soap opera also attended, Feldman said.
   Michaud said his group will arrange for celebrities to solicit
donations by appearing on talk shows and to broadcast public
service announcements. A toll-free number will be provided during
the announcements so pledges can be accepted, he said.
   Pigman said the new campaign will complement Rotary's 3-year-old
PolioPlus Program, which has been raising money with the goal of
providing polio immunizations to the roughly 100 million children
born anuually in developing nations.
   Through donations from its members and other citizens, Rotary
already has raised $100 million toward its $120-million goal for
the two years ending this June, Pigman said.
   He said the new campaign was announced Thursday because it was
the 40th anniversary of the World Health Organization.
   Rotary, which has about 1 million members in 162 nations, is an
organization of business people aimed at promoting community
improvement, business ethics and international good will and peace,
Pigman said.
   Michaud said the End Hunger Network is a Hollywood-based group
of entertainment community leaders trying to combat hunger and
other deadly problems.

   Police returned with a new search
warrant Thursday to a house where skulls and bone fragments were
found after a man said he was tortured and sexually abused there
for four days last week.
   The owner of the house, flea market merchant Robert Berdella, is
jailed without bond on seven counts of forcible sodomy and one each
of felonious restraint and first-degree assault.
   The alleged offenses all involve a 22-year-old man who wore only
a dog collar when he escaped from Berdella's home by jumping from a
second-floor window on Saturday. Authorities who arrested Berdella,
39, said they found pictures of the man being tortured and abused,
and similar pictures of other young men, one of whom appeared to be
dead.
   Police have been looking for possible links between Berdella and
11 missing persons cases, including those of two young men with
whom he was reportedly seen.
   His arrest led to the discovery of two human skulls, one
apparently a relic, in the home, while another was unearthed from
the backyard, along with bone fragments. It has not yet been
determined if those fragments are human.
   Police said Thursday that an interview with a carpenter who had
helped build a deck at the back of the house led authorities to
believe they might find more skulls or skeletons under the deck.
   But they began their work Thursday by using power saws to cut
through planks of the front porch.
   ``We don't want to take a chance on overlooking anything,'' said
Meyer. ``We're not going to leave that stone unturned.''
   He also said the investigative team working on the case had been
increased from six detectives to 11 so police can follow up on
calls from people who claim to have known Berdella.
   Police are still trying to identify eight young men in hundreds
of bondage pictures found in Berdella's home.

<TEXT>
   A white South African lawyer who was
jailed for anti-apartheid activities in the 1960s was seriously
wounded Thursday when a bomb exploded in his car, Mozambique's
official news agency reported.
   Albie Sachs's right hand was nearly severed from his arm in the
blast, which occurred as he opened his car door outside his
apartment in downtown Maputo, the agency said.
   Sachs was in very serious condition after an operation, hospital
sources told AIM.
   The news agency said a 33-year-old Mozambican man, Ishmael Nagib
Mussagy, suffered a serious head wound from bits of metal flying
from the booby-trapped car, and the man's 3-year-old son was
slightly injured.
   Sachs, a member of the African National Congress guerrilla
group, was jailed by South African authorities for more than three
months without charge in 1963. He also defended members of the
anti-apartheid group, which was banned in 1960.
   He was one of the few white people who participated in the
congress' 1960 defiance campaign, which urged people to ignore
apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested.
   Sachs left South Africa in 1963 after being released from jail.
He wrote a book about his experiences, ``The Prison Diary of Albie
Sachs,'' which was turned into a play in Britain.
   He worked in Britain before going to Mozambique, where he
lectured at the national university in Maputo until recently. He
works for the Justice Ministry in the capital, AIM said.
   Tom Lodge, a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatersrand and South Africa's foremost expert on the ANC,
said Sachs was not working for the ANC in Mozambique and was not an
officer in the organization, which is made up mostly of blacks.
   The attack is the latest in a series carried out against African
National Congress members outside South Africa. At least six ANC
members have been killed outside the country this year.
   South Africa has denied responsibility for the deaths, although
it repeatedly warns it will cross its borders in pursuit of ANC
members.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's blacks have no vote in national afairs. The whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

   Britons freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet in
Iran said Thursday the seizure was frightening but the Arab gunmen
soon relaxed and became ``quite considerate.''
   The 22 Britons were among two groups of hostages freed by
hijackers who forced the Kuwait Airlines Boeing 747, which was en
route from Bangkok to Kuwait, to land early Tuesday at Mashhad in
northeastern Iran. The Foreign Office said all the freed Britons
were ``fit and well.''
   Several spoke to British Broadcasting Corp. radio from Iran
before leaving for home.
   Various reports put the number of hijackers at five to seven.
They demand the relase of 17 pro-Iranian extremists convicted and
imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
the Persian Gulf sheikdom in 1983.
   Susan Carew-Jones, an advertising executive from London, said
the hijacking began as passengers slept.
   ``Suddenly there was a lot of shouting and we saw the terrorists
with grenades and we were told to put our hands on our heads and
look down,'' she said. ``When you see people with grenades and guns
you have to fear for your life.''
   After 15 or 20 minutes the passengers were ``herded together in
one section of the plane'' and told to keep their hands on their
heads until the landing at Mashhad Airport, she said.
   ``Then they told us to relax and be calm, and they were fine,''
Mrs. Carew-Jones said. ``They were quite relaxed themselves by
then. Nobody panicked.''
   ``They were quite considerate,'' she said, allowing her to
change seats to sit with her husband David. They gave oxygen to
passengers who felt ill when the cabin grew stuffy, she added.
   Social worker Jerry Moore, also from London, said the hostages
were ``treated very well.''
   There was ``no violence, no aggression,'' he said. ``Obviously
we were very frightened and intimidated for the first two or three
hours, but once we landed things settled down.''
   An Austrian businessman among those released said the gunmen
were brutal when they seized the plane but later treated the
hostages well.
   Josef Degeorgi, 53, who manages the IBM office in Kuwait, said
all the hijackers wore masks and they spoke English to non-Arab
passengers.
   At the outset, crew members were forced to lie on the floor with
their hands behind their heads and some passengers were handcuffed,
Degeorgi said.
   ``At this stage things were quite brutal,'' he said, ``but they
told passengers repeatedly to be calm, not to worry. They were
really very friendly to us.''
   Degeorgi said the air conditioning system failed to work at
times and it became very hot inside the aircraft, but ``the
treatment was excellent otherwise, with plenty of food and water.''

   A jury was selected Thursday in the trial of
John Zaccaro Jr. after four days of questions about attitudes
towards drugs and the prominence of the defendant's mother, former
vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Zaccaro, 24, is charged with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine
to an undercover agent. Opening arguments in the case are scheduled
for Friday morning, and attorneys said the trial could last three
days.
   The 12 jurors and two alternates were selected from more than 60
Rutland area residents, who were also questioned about their
attitudes toward undercover police work.
   Among those dismissed was a man who described people interested
in police work as fascist.
   District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey had initially refused to
dismiss the potential juror, Christopher Mayka, on Wednesday,
despite objections from the prosecutor.
   Under questioning, Mayka had said, ``I have often felt that some
people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background.
They like to have power.''
   On Thursday, Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn renewed
the argument, telling the judge that Mayka ``has preconceived
notions about police officers. He feels police officers generally
are on power trips.''
   The feelings about police are important in the case because the
defense wants to show that Zaccaro was entrapped by an undercover
police officer acting only on a rumor that Zaccaro might be selling
drugs.
   Jury selection was prolonged by the wide publicity given the
case. Most potential jurors said they were aware of the case,
prompting lawyers to repeatedly ask whether this knowledge would
affect their deliberations.
   Only one juror was dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., were present for the
questioning.

   About 180 tons of material, presumed to be
components for cluster bombs, were shipped from Italy to Iraq since
June, police said Thursday.
   Italian law forbids sale or supply of arms to Iraq or to Iran,
which have been at war in the Persian Gulf since September 1980.
Officials here said two men were arrested and a third was sought.
   The shipments were halted with the March 24 seizure at Rome's
Leonardo da Vinci airport of nearly 27 tons of bomb parts about to
be loaded on an Iraqi Airways jet bound for Baghdad, said officials
of the carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police force.
   An added 33 tons of parts, waiting to be transported to the
airport and eventually to Iraq, also were seized recently in Italy,
the police said.
   Customs declarations were falsified to describe the components
as parts for furniture or spare parts for home appliances or
plumbing repair, the police said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   They said documents examined by police showed the Iraqi Ministry
of Planning ordered the shipments and the Iraqi government
provided, for export agents in Rome, a letter of credit for $8
million to cover dealings with Italian factories manufacturing the
parts.
   Cluster bombs, designed to spread shrapnel over a wide area, are
an effective anti-personnel weapon. Iraq has used such bombs to
break up mass Iranian ground assaults. Iran says Iraq dropped
cluster bombs in Kurdistan against villages which it says were also
hit by chemical bombs March 16-17.
   Police reported finding Iraqi government documents outlining
which components were needed for the cluster bombs.
   A police official said other bomb components, 16 tons in all,
were seized at 27 small factories that received the Iraqi orders. A
few factories are in the Milan area; others are in Tuscany.
   No one answered at the Iraqi Embassy in Rome when called for
comment.
   Police said Thursday the two men arrested were charged with
construction, export and illegal holding of war arms. Both worked
for an import-export firm in Rome that police said arranged the
bomb parts delivery.
   Officers identified them as Iraqi-born Ahmad Al Kodasi, 30, an
Italian citizen, and Hamoudi Jaffar Kasim, 21, of Baghdad.
   Police said they a third man sought is an Iraqi.
   They said no charges have been brought against factory officials.
   The parts ranged from metal tubes and cones, which the factories
described as plumbing pieces, to plastic connecting parts listed on
the inventory as table legs, police said.
   Several investigations are being carried out in Italy into the
alleged supply of weapons to Iran by Italian arms manufacturers.

<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday
night apparently backtracked on its claim that the army killed
``four ANC terrorists'' in an attack on a house in Botswana 10 days
ago.
   A South African television report indicated only one of the dead
was an operative of the outlawed African National Congress and that
any connection between two of those killed and the ANC was
uncertain.
   Botswana itself on Thursday, in a letter from the office of
President Quett Masire, demanded an apology and compensation for
``South Africa's unprovoked act of aggression.'' It earlier called
the attack ``cold-blooded murder of four innocent people in their
sleep.''
   The South African Defense Force said March 28 that the three
women and one man killed in its pre-dawn assault on the house,
which was blown up, were all ANC ``terrorists.'' Defense Force
spokesmen refused to say at the time who they had killed but
insisted the identities were known.
   The Botswana government said the three women were Batswana
civilians and the man was a South African refugee who had been in
the country since 1979. All were buried Thursday in Gaborone, the
capital.
   Government-run South African TV said Thursday night in reporting
on the burial that the dead man was a senior ANC commander and that
``at least one (of the three women) was involved with the ANC.''
   South Africa identified the man as Solomon Molefi, also known as
Paul Naledi, and said he was ANC regional commander in Botswana.
   Botswana said the man was Charles Mokoena, a South African
refugee, and that neither he nor the three women were ANC members.
It called South Africa's identification of the man ``deliberate
fabrication.''
   Botswana's government supports the ANC's goal of ending
white-minority domination in South Africa, but says it does not
allow guerrillas to launch cross-border attacks from its territory.
   Botswana also said South Africa ``has failed to substantiate its
allegation'' that Botswana was being used as a transit route for
ANC attacks.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, wages a bombing and sabotage
campaign trying to overthrow South Africa's government.
   Since the March 28 raid, several South African tourists said
they were harassed while visiting Botswana.
   ``The Department of Foreign Affairs wishes to lodge strong
protest ... for the aggravated actions launched by the Botswana
Defense Force against tourists,'' said a diplomatic note sent to
Botswana.
   South Africa has not responded to Botswana's demand for
compensation for the attack.

   Armed Jewish settlers
vowed revenge Thursday and shouted ``Expel the Arabs!'' as they
buried an Israeli girl killed in a clash with Palestinians in the
West Bank.
   Troops killed an Arab in Beita, the town where 15-year-old Tirza
Porat was slain the day before. The army said he disobeyed an order
to halt.
   Autopsy results released by the army showed that the girl, Tirza
Porat, was shot in the head and also struck in the head by a stone
or large object. An army official said the cause of death could not
immediately be determined.
   Shortly after Tirza died Wednesday, the army said she was killed
by a bullet, but then said she was stoned to death by Arab
villagers. An Israel television report raised the possibility that
Tirza was inadvertently shot by a Jewish settlers during the clash.
   Soldiers arrested hundreds of Arabs and blew up five homes
Thursday in Beita, while armed Israeli civilians rampaged through
two nearby villages, beating Arabs, breaking windows and firing
shots in the air.
   An army announcement said the Palestinian fatally shot Thursday
was a suspect in the attack on 16 Israeli teen-agers the day
before. The group was on a holiday outing accompanied by two adult
settlers armed with automatic rifles.
   In addition to Tirza, two Arabs were killed in the Wednesday
melee. Two Arabs were wounded and 13 Israelis injured.
   Israel radio quoted army investigators as saying Tirza was shot,
but also struck in the head by a stone hurled by the mother and
sister of an Arab killed in the clash. The radio report said the
two women were under arrest.
   Earlier, Israel TV cited an unidentified military source as
saying Tirza was wounded by a bullet fired by the gun of one of the
Israeli settlers.
   The army said that during the clash, villagers in Beita wrested
guns away from the Israeli guards. However, the army source said
the magazines of the two weapons probably were empty at that time.
He gave no details.
   There was no indication any other weapons were fired during the
clash.
   ``Tirza Porat's only crime was taking a walk in her country,''
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told about 9,000 mourners who
gathered under heavy guard at the region's Jewish cemetery. ``God
will avenge her blood.''
   Tirza lived in the Elon Moreh settlement overlooking the West
Bank city of Nablus.
   The girl, killed during the weeklong Passover celebration, was
the first Israeli civilian victim of the 4-month-old violence in
the territories Israel captured in the 1967 war. At least 141 Arabs
have died, according to U.N. figures, and an Israeli soldier was
stabbed to death.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was in the Middle East on
Thursday, the last full day of his second shuttle to promote a U.S.
peace plan.
   About 100 Israeli soldiers were stationed along the 15-mile
route of the funeral procession Thursday from Elon Moreh to the
Karnei Shomron cemetery.
   The procession inched through the heart of Nablus, then passed a
dozen Arab villages whose streets were deserted.
   Benny Katzover, president of the settlement council, said Jewish
settlers would protest daily in front of Shamir's office until the
government toughened its policies in the West Bank, where 65,000
Jewish settlers and 850,000 Palestinians live.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander in the West Bank, said
hundreds of Palestinians were rounded up in Beita and surrounding
villages.
   Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, a member of Parliament from the West Bank
settlement of Kiryat Arba, said Beita should be demolished.
   ``When an Arab village carried out a pogrom on Israeli children,
there's nothing to do but destroy the village, to wipe it out from
the land of Israel,'' Waldman declared.
   Some people shouted ``Revenge, revenge!'' and ``Expel the
Arabs!'' Others hit news photographers, accusing the media of
feeding the violence.
   After the funeral, Elon Moreh settlers entered the adjacent Arab
village, Deir el Hatab, and fired shots into the air until troops
ordered them out. Jewish settlers went on an overnight rampage in
nearby Hawwara, breaking windows and beating some Arabs.
   ``Every house on the main road is in danger of attack now. They
want to kill us,'' said Raja Salem of Hawwara.
   He had a swollen lip and a cut on his right cheek. He said
settlers beat him and broke seven windows in his home and his car
windshield.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 53 people and broke up a
Canadian car theft ring that made $3.25 million in seven months and
peddled stolen car parts in the United States, a Quebec provinicial
police spokesman said Thursday.
   Spokesman Michel Martin said the center of the operation was
Brady's Auto Parts Inc., a scrapyard in La Plaine, Quebec, 15 miles
north of Montreal, which contained more than 800 vehicles.
   He said the vehicles were stolen in Canada, brought to the yard
and stripped of marketable parts which were then sold to garages
throughout eastern Canada, in New York state and in New England
states bordering Canada.
   ``If the part wasn't in stock, the caller was asked to check
back in a couple of days. By then a car, bearing the badly needed
part, would have been stolen,'' Martin said.
   The arrests were made in 77 early-morning raids Wednesday
following a seven-month investigation.
   All of the suspects are Canadians, mostly from Quebec. Martin
said they faced a variety of charges in court.
   He said one is an official of Quebec's vehicle bureau who will
be charged with complicity in the marketing of stolen cars and
parts.
   ``It's the biggest organized (car theft) ring ever smashed in
Canada,'' he said.
   Martin said police still were investigating some of the garages
that ordered the parts to determine if they knew they were
obtaining stolen goods.

<HEAD>Up to $9.2 Billion Needed To Upgrade Existing Public Housing,
Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development estimates it will cost up to $9.2 billion to make the
nation's existing public housing ``decent, safe and sanitary.''
   The estimate, in a report issued for publication Friday, is
based on inspection of 2,196 units and 3,120 buildings at public
housing projects across the country at the end of 1985. It took
more than two years and $5 million to compile and review the final
report which was ordered by Congress, HUD officials said.
   Since then, said HUD deputy assistant secretary C. Duncan
MacRae, $3.9 billion has been spent. He said another study to be
completed this summer will show how much needs to be spent each
year to keep public housing at mandatory HUD standards.
   The study released by HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce said repair
and renovation of existing units among the 1.3 million dwellings
nationwide will cost between $7.5 billion and $9.2 billion.
   ``HUD is committed to restoring the public housing stock to
decent, safe and sanitary conditions in every instance where that
housing is viable,'' Pierce said. The report indicates that only 5
percent to 10 percent of public housing is not viable and not worth
modernizing.
   HUD mandatory modernization standards include repairs and
changes to ``preserve public health and safety, ensure bulding
integrity, meet local code requirements and meet federal standards
for accessibliity for the handicapped as well as reduction of
hazards associated with lead-based paint,'' said a HUD statement
accompanying the study.
   Pierce said half the nation's public housing has been in service
for between 20 and 40 years.
   He said that after the backlog is met, additional funds will be
needed from federal, state and local governments.
   The 283-page report, ``Study of the Modernization Needs of the
Public and Indian Housing Stock,'' was based on data gathered by
Abt Associates of Cambridge, Mass.
   Its estimates cover 11,000 public housing projects, where
low-income families live, paying about 30 percent of their incomes
as rent. Individual housing authorities own the units, aided by
federal assistance and financing.
   Officials say 3 million Americans live in public housing.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church said
Thursday it was suspending its effort to mediate Panama's political
crisis as the first major split appeared in the opposition to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Marcos G. McGrath, the Catholic archbishop of Panama, said in a
statement he was withdrawing his mediation offer for three reasons:
   _Opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it
showed it was willing to discuss the departure of Noriega.
   _The archbishop had not received Noriega's ``explicit and
personal backing of the initiative'' in writing.
   _There were no assurances that the four international leaders
who proposed the talks could be present.
   The breakdown came a day after Noriega ordered the arrests of
several leading opponents. The general has defied U.S. efforts to
force his resignation.
   In another development, banking and diplomatic sources said
Panama's banks would not reopen Friday, and possibly not next week.
The government said last week it hoped to have banks functioning
again Friday.
   A major rift appeared Thursday in the anti-Noriega opposition,
as two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own
anti-government movement.
   Their leaders argued that U.S. economic sanctions are hurting
Panama's people more than they are damaging Noriega and the
civilian government he controls.
   Roberto Arosemena and Mauro Zuniga, leaders of the Popular
Action Party, announced formation of the Popular Civic Movement in
a break with the National Civic Crusade, an alliance of about 200
organizations that has led the 10-month-old effort to oust Noriega.
   They told a news conference their movement also is backed by the
Authentic Panamanian Party, the largest opposition political party.
   Washington has supported the Civic Crusade in its effort to
remove Noriega as chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, which
include the military and police. Noriega is under indictment in the
United States on drug trafficking charges, which he denies.
   Zuniga said the new movement rejects any U.S. influence.
   ``For us, no recipe that comes from Washington has been
favorable to the Panamanians,'' he said. ``The people of the world
know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals, the
United States and the Soviet Union, never are favorable to the
interests of the people.''
   He added: ``It is absolutely necessary for Gen. Noriega to
abandon his post. For us, this is fundamental.''
   Leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations, strikes
and other protests of the Civic Crusade, while differing with some
of its policies and generally favoring a harder line.
   Popular Action, for example, refused to join the Crusade,
Authentic Panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to the
proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the Catholic
church.
   The dialogue was proposed by Presidents Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and ex-presidents
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica.
   Political parties linked most closely with the Civic Crusade are
the Democratic Christians and the Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement, known as Molirena.
   Those two parties, the Crusade and the United States all
recognize deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the
constitutional head of state. Popular Action and the Authentic
Panamanian Party do not.
   Noriega orchestrated the ouster of Delvalle on Feb. 26, the day
after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   Zuniga, brother of a former Popular Action presidential
candidate, said the movement ``will center its fight on the
original principles of the Civic Crusade.''
   ``The United States should not continue economic and military
action against Panama,'' Arosemena said. ``The Panamanian people
are capable of solving their own problems.''
   Banking and diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said bank would not open Friday even on a limited basis.
They said bankers feared the government would use their deposits if
they reopened.
   The government, whose deposits in U.S. banks have been frozen,
has not met public payrolls since the crisis began.
   The last of 1,300 additional U.S. soldiers arrived Thursday at
Howard Air Force Base outside Panama City, completing a buildup
meant to provide greater security for the Panama Canal, American
installations and U.S. citizens.
   Late Wednesday, the government said it had issued arrest
warrants for three leading opponents, including Delvalle, who has
been in hiding in Panama.
   It also asked Interpol, the international police organization,
to arrest Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a former ambassador to the United
States, and Juan B. Sosa, who was Delvalle's envoy in Washington
and remains there.
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday the United
States ``would regard any efforts by the Noriega regime to attempt
arrests or prosecutions of President Delvalle and the others for
their activities in urging and supporting U.S. sanctions as the
unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime.''

<HEAD>Student Posters Criticize Educational Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at China's leading university put up
posters this week criticizing government education policy, but
unlike student protesters in 1986, they made no sweeping calls for
democracy.
   The official response so far also has been more restrained. The
posters have been allowed to stay up for days on Beijing
University's main bulletin board.
   In 1986, tens of thousands of students at Beijing University and
schools in other cities put up posters and took to the streets
demanding more democracy.
   Authorities were lenient at first, but cracked down when they
thought the students became too bold. Posters were torn down and
students were ordered back to campus.
   The authorities' decision to leave the latest posters alone
appeared to be an example of a new government openness which is
being promted during the present session of the National People's
Congress, China's legislature.
   Lu Hao, president of Beijing University's student association,
noted that most of the opinions advanced in the posters have been
expressed by congress delegates or printed in the official press.
He said it was normal that students should raise such complaints.
   He and other students said the posters contained no radical
ideas and should not be interpreted as signs of widespread student
discontent.
   A lengthy ``open letter'' directed to congress delegates was
posted Wednesday at Beijing University, and on Thursday other
posters were put up which picked apart official educational policy
and proposed reforms.
   Students said an ``open letter'' would be presented to the
congress demanding that more money be spent on education and
charging that leaders were neglecting education in their attempts
to modernize China.
   Some of the posters opposed a proposal from the State Education
Commission which would require students and faculty to earn money
for their universities by running their own factories or hiring
themselves out to other businesses.
   Students regard the idea as further evidence that the leadership
is unwilling to invest in education and instead wants students and
teachers to fend for themselves.
   One poster called on students to express their displeasure with
the idea by going to Tiananmen Square in central Beijing to earn
money by shining shoes.
   About 80 students were gathered at about noon Thursday, reading
and discussing the posters. Most seemed to agree with the
criticisms.
   Presidents of four of China's major universities, including
Beijing University, told the English-language China Daily last week
that state funding falls far short of their operating needs.

   The United States and South Korea on
Thursday ended their annual military field training exercise
involving U.S. troops from the American continent and Pacific
areas, a military announcement said.
   The 10-day field exercise, which was held at various parts of
South Korea, was the highlight of Team Spirit 88 which involved
about 200,000 troops from the two countries.
   The announcement from the U.S.-South Korea Combined Forces
Command said that all deployed forces will return to their home
bases by early May.
   The command said Team Spirit, which was first held in 1976, was
designed to improve defensive readiness of South Korean and U.S.
forces through joint operations.
   Seoul has attached a special meaning to the joint exercise
because North Korea threatens to disrupt the Seoul Olympic Games.
Pyongyang has refused to take part in the Games unless its demand
to be made a cohost is met.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur said Tuesday
while on a visit here that the exercise was ``a valuable
demonstraton of our commitment to preserving peace ... and timely
in this year of the Seoul Olympics.''
   Washington has pledged to provide necessary security support to
prevent North Korea from disrupting the Games.
   Also on Thursday, the U.S. Air Force said it plans to introduce
at least 24 more F-16 fighters this year to improve combat
capability of its tactical fighter wing in South Korea.
   The U.S. Air Force said its 51st Tactical Fighter Wing here
would replace F-4E Phantom II fighters now in service with F-16
fighters this fall.
   U.S. officials said the introduction of F-16 Fighting Falcons
would help meet military threat from North Korea and the
modernization of the Soviet military in the region.
   Currently, 12 F-4E Phamtom fighters are assigned to two U.S. air
bases in South Korea each: the 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron in
Osan and the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron in Taegu, they said.
   A U.S. Air Force statement said the 36th TFS will receive 24
F-16C and D models in October 1989 to improve and modernize its
combat capability and readiness.
   The 497th TFS in Taegu will be deactivated early next year in
line with budget cuts, with its 12 F-4E Phantom fighters to be
released for foreign sales, the statement said.

<HEAD>`Borderlines,' Two One-Act Plays by John Bishop, Open Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The men in ``Borderlines,'' the umbrella title
for two new one-act plays by John Bishop, sure have their problems.
   ``Right now I'm having trouble connecting to things,'' admits
Charles Graham, the protagonist in the evening's pretentious
curtain-raiser. It's called ``Borderline'' without the ``s,''
presumably to mark its anti-hero's precarious state of mind.
   Charles is a yuppyish marketing specialist who sells things like
shampoo and toothpaste, but his mind is not on his work. He worries
about his stale marriage, frets about the big basketball game he
blew in high school, commiserates and drinks with a crude
co-worker, sleeps with a young secretary and finally kills the
woman's jealous boyfriend.
   In between these episodes, a lecturer appears on stage to
outline Charles' violent family tree which she traces back several
centuries to the border wars between England and Scotland. His
ancestors made their way to America where they were involved in one
disastrous episode after another _ from Indian wars in Pennsylvania
to battles between cowboys and sheepmen in Arizona and fights over
land in Oklahoma.
   Bishop suggests that Charles' homicidal nature was preordained.
It's in man's genes and no amount of moping about and worrying is
going to change things.
   Much of the same anxiety pervades ``Keepin' An Eye On Louie,''
the second and much more successful half of the evening. This time,
the man at sea with himself is Dave, a policeman who keeps a New
York mobster named Louie under surveillance.
   Dave is just as miserable as Charles but in this play, the
dialogue crackles with blue-collar banter. There are a lot of jokes
about members of the mob with first names like Bananas or Tomatoes
or Philadelphia or Detroit.
   Also enlivening the proceedings is the appearance _ in drag _ of
Louie's recalcitrant son-in-law, who has decided to help the police
and identify members of the mob.
   Dave also can't communicate with his wife. The reason is never
made clear, although the playwright paints a picture of a man
closer to his job and his fellow police officers than the woman he
married. It's an unsatisfactory portrait.
   The cast is first-rate, particularly Cotter Smith as the
distraught executive in the first play and Bruce McCarty as the
unnerved policeman in the second. They bring a conviction to their
roles that is not supported by the writing.
   Despite those performances and Robert Bailey's fluid direction,
``Borderlines,'' which arrived Thursday at off-Broadway's Circle
Repertory Company, never becomes much more than two morose, murky
tales of male menopause.

   Jurors acquitted 13 white supremacists
Thursday of charges including conspiring to overthrow the federal
government and to kill a federal judge and FBI agent.
   The all-white jury returned the verdict in its fourth day of
deliberations, a day after U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold
refused to accept the panel's statement that it was deadlocked on
two of the counts.
   The defendants included three leaders of white supremacist
groups: Louis Ray Beam Jr., 41, of Houston; Robert E. Miles, 63, of
Cohoctah, Mich., and Richard G. Butler, 70, of Hayden Lake, Idaho.
   Asked how the seven-week trial affected the white supremacist
movement, Miles said, ``Who knows? What movement? What's left of it
after this?''
   U.S. Attorney J. Michael Fitzhugh said he thought the government
had proved its case but ``we accept the verdict of the jury.''
   Nine defendants were charged with seditious conspiracy, accused
of wanting to overthrow the government and start an all-white
nation in the Pacific Northwest. Five were accused of conspiring to
kill the federal officials, and two also were charged with
transporting stolen money across state lines.
   Six of the defendants are already serving prison terms for other
crimes.
   The jury reached a verdict Wednesday on the charge involving the
judge and FBI agent, but Arnold ordered it sealed until
deliberations were complete.
   The government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored
trucks of $4.1 million, including about $1 million that still is
missing.
   The defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key
government witness, James Ellison, 47, who led a supremacist group
in Arkansas and now is serving 20 years for racketeering.
   ``The government was going to send a message to the movement.
The movement sent a message to the government. The message was the
same one God told pharoah, `Let my people go,''' said Thom Robb,
the national chaplain of the Ku Klux Klan, who hugged several of
the defendants after the verdict was announced.
   Fitzhugh said it was not a political trial. ``We weren't after
them for what they believed or what they said, but what they did,''
he said.
   He declined to say whether any investigations of a similar
nature are under way and said he did not know the cost of the trial.
   Burton Levinson, national chairman of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, said in a statement from New York that the
verdicts were ``a real setback in the war against organized hate.''
   ``Although many of the defendants are already serving prison
terms growing out of their extremist activities, the others,
including the most important leaders, will now be free to once
again promote their anti-democratic and bigoted aims. The outcome
means that we must and will remain vigilant,'' Levinson said.
   Beam celebrated his acquittal by going to a Confederate memorial
opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he
called the ``Zionist occupation government.''
   ``There are over 150 other political prisoners being held in
ZOG's jails that need to be freed,'' Beam said.
   ``I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today. I think
everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being
punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.''
   Beam's wife, Sheila, fainted and was carried a block to an
attorney's office by her husband.
   Maximum penalties for conviction would have included 20 years
and a $20,000 fine for seditious conspiracy, life for conspiracy to
murder, and 10 years and a $10,000 fine for transporting stolen
money.
   The trial started Feb. 16.
   In addition to Beam, Miles and Butler, the defendants included:
   Richard Joseph Scutari, 40, of New York, already serving 60
years after being convicted of racketeering in a trial in Seattle.
   Bruce Carroll Pierce, 32, of Metalline Falls, Wash., serving 100
years from Seattle for racketeering and 150 years after being
convicted in Denver of violating the civil rights of radio
personality Alan Berg by murdering him.
   Andrew Virgil Barnhill, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., serving 40
years for racketeering.
   Ardie McBrearty, 60, of Gentry, Ark., serving 40 years for
racketeering.
   David Eden Lane, 48, of Denver, serving 40 years for
racketeering and 150 years for Berg's death.
   Richard Wayne Snell, 57, of Muse, Okla., sentenced to die for
the murder of a pawn shop operator in 1983 and life in prison
without parole for the 1984 slaying of an Arkansas state trooper.
   Lambert Miller, 47, of Springfield, Mo.
   David Michael McGuire, 25, of Greenville, Ill.
   Ivan Ray Wade, 35, of Smithville, Ark.
   William Wade, 68, of Smithville, father of Ivan Ray Wade.
   Miles, Butler, Beam, Scutari, Pierce, Barnhill, McBrearty, Lane
and Snell were acquitted on charges of seditious conspiracy;
Scutari and Barnhill were acquitted of transporting stolen money,
and Snell, Miller, McGuire and the Wades were acquitted of
conspiracy to commit murder.
   The targets of the alleged murder conspiracy were U.S. District
Judge H. Franklin Waters and FBI agent Jack Knox in Fayetteville,
Ark. Prosecutors said the defendants got no further in the murder
plot than to begin driving to Fayetteville but turning back because
of snow.

   A grand jury Thursday indicted two
state legislators, the mayor and 13 other political figures in a
mountain coal county already wracked by charges of job-selling and
drug-dealing by local officials.
   One indictment charged a state senator who was a former county
commissioner with bribery in the alleged sale of the Mingo County
sheriff's job in 1982 for $100,000, and another indictment accused
15 others of violations of state election laws and conspiracy.
   The 15 are accused of conspiring with Johnie M. Owens, the
former sheriff and former county Democratic Party chairman, and
others to influence elections in 1984 and 1986 and law enforcement
in the county.
   ``The indictment charges this group of people with attempting
basically to subvert the free election system in Mingo County,''
said special prosecutor James Colburn. ``They conspired ... by
illegal campaign contributions, by illegal campaign expenditures,
by bribery, by false accounting, and by conspiring to do all these
things.''
   Mingo County, the site of the Hatfied-McCoy Fued between
mountain clans after the Civil War, is a coal-mining county of
37,000 people along the Kentucky border. Williamson, the largest
town, has about 6,000 residents.
   A federal grand jury indicted several current and former county
officials over the past year, including current Sheriff Charles
``Eddie'' Hilbert, in connection with his appointment as sheriff.
   Owens, who has pleaded guilty, said he accepted a $20,000 down
payment on the $100,000 bribe from Hilbert, then persuaded the
three county commissioners to accept his resignation and appoint
Hilbert in exchange for half of the bribe.
   Former Commissioner Rastie Runyon also has pleaded guilty and
will be sentenced with Owens on April 18, the same day Hilbert is
scheduled to enter a plea in a drug case as part of an agreement
with prosecutors.
   In the drug case, authorities say a drug ring openly run by a
small-town fire chief, police chief and their families was
protected by a web of bribes to officials.
   Commissioner Steve Adkins, the only member of the 1982 County
Commission still in office, was indicted earlier on one count of
bribery. He has denied the charge but is not running for
re-election.
   The third commissioner, state Sen. H. Truman Chafin, was
indicted Thursday with one felony count of bribery.
   Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in Mingo
County Circuit Court.
   Democratic Sen. John Pat Fanning was charged with two counts of
bribery, one count of conspiracy and one count of filing false
accounts _ all felonies _ and one count each of making political
contributions exceeding the state limits and failing to report
political expenditures, both misdemeanors.
   Mingo County Prosecutor W. Thomas Ward was indicted on five
felony counts, three counts of bribery and one each of conspiracy
and filing false accounts, plus two misdemeanors. Williamson Mayor
Sam Kapourales was indicted on two felony counts _ bribery and
conspiracy _ and two misdemeanor counts.
   Chafin denied having anything to do with sale of the sheriff's
office.
   ``I received no money or benefit as a result of this
transaction,'' he said. ``I was not there when the commission voted
on these matters, nor did I agree with anyone at any time not to be
present at that meeting.''
   Fanning was out of his office late Thursday afternoon and was
unavailable for comment, a person answering the phone in his office
said. Neither Ward nor Kapourales was in his office and could not
be reached for comment by telephone.
   Also named as defendants are county school board members Paul
Sizemore and Robert Simpkins, former Delegates James B. Simpkins,
Irvine K.O. Damron, and R. Doyle Van Meter II, County Commissioners
Ronnie Rumora and Steve Adkins, former Mingo County Magistrate Joey
Kohari, Magistrate Bill Webb, former Circuit Court Clerk Robert J.
``Jack'' Webb, former County Clerk Hugh Wellman and Larry Hamrick,
a former school board member and former director of the county's
anti-poverty agency.
   Also indicted Thursday was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used car
dealership at Delbarton owned by former county commissioner and
county Democratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was not named
in the indictment.
   Last week, grand jurors heard testimony from candidates in the
1984 and 1986 primary elections as well as United Mine Workers
Local 1440 President Bill Davis and Wally Warden, editor of the
Williamson Daily News.
   The newspaper has extensively covered the state and federal
probes in Mingo County, and Warden provided jurors with background
on the makeup of campaign slates in past elections and with
information on precincts that have been the site of voting
irregularities.
   Davis reportedly was questioned about campaign contributions and
financial support from COMPAC, the UMW's political action committee.

   Airport workers in northeast Iran
refueled a Kuwaiti jetliner and its Arab hijackers said they would
take off Friday morning with about 50 hostages held for three days,
Iran's news agency reported.
   The plane was refueled after the hijackers fired at security
guards at the Masshad airport and threatened to force the pilot to
fly with the little fuel left in the jet's tanks, said the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   It first quoted the hijackers as saying the plane would leave at
midnight (4:30 p.m. EDT), in a dispatch filed only two minutes
before that time, and said later the departure had been delayed
until 6 a.m. (10:30 p.m. EDT). The second departure time passed
with no new word from IRNA.
   No destination was given.
   According to IRNA, Iranian officials asked the hijackers for the
extension to provide time for the Turkish and Pakistani prime
ministers, Turgut Ozal and Mohammed Khan Junejo, to talk to Kuwaiti
officials in an effort to convinve them to accept the hijackers'
demand.
   The hijackers, said to number five to seven, want Kuwait to free
17 pro-Iran extremists convicted and imprisoned in the Persian Gulf
sheikdom for bombings at the U.S. and French embassies there in
1983.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Ozal spoke by telephone with
Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran on Thursday.
   It said Musavi told Ozal his government wanted to end the
incident without ``any unhappy event,'' but added: ``Of course you
should know that our possibilities are limited and therefore we
hope the Kuwaiti government will understand the restrictions in the
holy city of Mashhad and fulfil its humanitarian duty, in trying to
bring the problem to a peaceful end.''
   Thirty-two people were released from the plane early Thursday
and, along with 25 freed earlier, left Mashhad for Kuwait, the
agency reported. The British Foreign Office said early Friday that
the passengers had arrived in Kuwait.
   The hijacking occurred early Tuesday, as the plane with 112
people aboard was flying from Bangkok to Kuwait.
   When IRNA reported the original departure time, it said ``there
are still obstacles on the runway,'' placed there earlier by
airport officials to keep the jet from taking off.
   On the third day of the drama, the hijackers said they placed
explosives throughout the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747, which still
had 55 passengers and crew aboard, IRNA reported.
   Among the hostages are three members of Kuwait's royal family.
One appealed to Iranian authorities to provide jet fuel, IRNA said.
   ``We're very tired and our brothers (the hijackers) are very
serious in their threat to blow up the plane,'' Fadel Khaled
al-Sabah told the control tower by radio, IRNA reported.
   The hijackers fired several shots out of the plane Thursday
after repeating their demand for fuel, IRNA said. It did not
mention casualties.
   Iranian media and some of the freed hostages have described the
hijackers as masked, Arabic-speaking men armed with pistols and
hand grenades.
   One of the passengers, Josef Degeorgi, 53, of Austria, told The
Associated Press the gunmen carried handguns and claimed to have
hand grenades. He said there were seven and that all wore masks.
   In London, freed British passenger Jean Sefton was quoted
Thursday as saying that two of the hijackers offered her pillows
and drinks and chatted with her daughters in English.
   ``We didn't have time to be frightened, things happened so
fast,'' Ms. Sefton told London's Daily Mail.
   IRNA had reported that Iranian officials were refusing to supply
fuel or food to the hijackers unless the passengers and crew were
released. But the refueling went ahead without any more releases
reported.
   IRNA paraphrased an Iranian negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister
Ali-Reza Moayyeri, as saying a Kuwaiti negotiating team in Mashhad
``does not take the issue (of the hijacking) seriously.''
   Kuwait has rejected the hijackers' demands.
   The Kuwait News Agency reported that the government sent a
letter to Musavi praising Iran's efforts to end the hijacking but
opposing any moves to allow the plane to leave.
   Numerous acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on Shiite
Moslems acting with backing from Iran, which acccuses Kuwait of
aiding Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. Kuwaiti diplomats were brought
home after their embassy in Tehran was ransacked.
   Bahraini sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
passports held by five alleged Bahrainis aboard the plane must be
fake.
   They said that when the passport numbers were provided by
authorities in Bangkok and checked in Bahrain, they did not match
with the names given.
   No positive breakdown by nationality of the remaining hostages
was possible, due to discrepancies between lists released by IRNA
and by the airline's offices in Bangkok.

   Winds howling across Lake Michigan Wednesday with
gusts to 75 mph defaced Chicago landmarks and caused widespread
damage and power outages across Illinois and neighboring states.
   More than 60 windows cracked or blew out in the Sears Tower, the
world's tallest building at 1,452 feet. A 13-foot spire plummeted
28 stories from the top of the white, terra-cotta-covered Wrigley
Building overlooking the Chicago River.
   The winds, which were expected to diminish overnight, whipped up
waves as high as 20 feet on Lake Michigan, said meteorologist Don
Morrison of the National Weather Service.
   Commonwealth Edison, which serves 3 million northeastern
Illinois customers, reported 30,000 without power at midafternoon,
but said most would have their electricity restored Wednesday night.
   The winds disrupted transportation in the region by flooding
low-lying roads, downing trees and creating hazards for
tractor-trailers and other high-profile vehicles. Delays of about
an hour were reported at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.
   Wind gusts up to 50 mph kicked up 14-foot waves on Lake Michigan.
   In Michigan, more than 2 inches of rain flooded roads and sent
small rivers over their banks, the weather service said.
   In northern Indiana, gale-force winds gusting as high as 92 mph
carried marble-sized hail, heavy rains and even snow, just a day
after afternoon highs had reached the 80s.
   Two truck drivers were injured when their rigs were blown onto
their sides on Interstate 70, and flying glass from shattered
windows injured at least two others in Indiana, authorities said.
   Chicago police cordoned off the streets around the 110-story
Sears Tower, and some workers there moved out of their offices as
high winds assaulted the windows.
   ``With some 16,000 windows in total, although the number of
windows broken or damaged is a significant number ... it proves
that the basic design is good,'' said Gordon Jones, a Sears,
Roebuck and Co. spokesman.
   Across town at the Wrigley Building, the metal spire fell to the
sidewalk, which was then cordoned off.
   ``There's never been anything like that happen,'' said spokesman
Bill Piet of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co.
   The wind began rising late Tuesday, and six people were treated
and released for injuries suffered when a store window blew out in
Bloomington in central Illinois. Trees were uprooted, and extensive
damage was reported to planes and hangars at the city airport, and
to roofs of homes there.

fatally shooting a suicidal 20-year-old man who had held his young
girlfriend hostage apparently with a fake gun, authorities said.
   Israel Ramos died Wednesday afternoon of a single gunshot wound
at York Hospital, where he had been taken for surgery, a hospital
spokeswoman said. The hostage, a 14-year-old runaway whose name was
withheld by authorities, was not injured.
   Ramos had held what appeared to be an automatic gun to the
girl's head, which was covered by a pillowcase.
   Authorities originally said that a police sharpshooter fired at
Ramos after the hostage taker said, ``I am now going to kill her.''
   But film shot by WGAL-TV in Lancaster showed Ramos was hit by a
bullet moments after he swore at police and said ``I'm coming out.''
   Both Ramos' hands were on a window ledge, no gun was apparent
and the girl was out of view. As soon as Ramos was shot in the
abdomen, the teen came to the window shouting for an ambulance.
   Police Chief William Hose, who was not present at the shooting,
said the initial accounts may have been wrong and that the incident
was being investigated. State police were called in to assist.
   The chief said a handgun and an Uzi-type rifle found in Ramos'
apartment appeared to be fakes.
   The sharpshooter's name was not released.
   During the siege, Ramos tossed radios, a stereo, pizza boxes and
shoes from the window as he swore at police and asked whether he
should beat his hostage.
   He refused to surrender despite pleas from his psychiatric
counselor, who had been treating Ramos for suicidal tendencies,
said police Lt. Dennis McMaster.

   The government issued an arrest
warrant for deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle, saying he will
be charged with crimes against the state and the nation's economic
security.
   In another development, the government offered to hold
church-mediated talks with the political opposition. The offer came
after police fired birdshot to break up an anti-government rally by
50 people on Wednesday. Two U.S. soldiers were briefly detained
near the site of the protest.
   Delvalle has been in hiding since Feb. 26, when he was removed
from office after trying to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as
head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. Noriega is the power
behind the civilian government.

   An American company that sells tear gas to
Israel says it is trying to ensure that the chemical crowd-control
agent is being used properly against Arab protesters.
   In the aftermath of claims by the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee that the substance has been misused,
``We are redoubling our effort to see that it is used properly,''
said Burl Alison, vice president of TransTechnology Corp. of
Sherman Oaks, Calif.
   ``We are writing to the prime minister (of Israel) to try to get
some attention to the proper use of the product,'' Mrs. Alison said.
   Yossi Gal, a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy, said the
committee's allegationthat more than 30 people had died from
exposure to tear gas is grossly exaggerated. The Israelis have
found only one probable death attributable to tear gas, he said.

   Contempt citations are being sought against
White House budget chief James Miller and Assistant Labor Secretary
John Pendergrass on a claim they are illegally blocking
court-ordered warnings to 18 million American workers about toxic
chemicals.
   The United Steelworkers union filed suit against the two Reagan
administration officials Wednesday in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia, which ordered the warnings last year.
   Under ``right-to-know'' regulations ordered last May by the
court and issued in August by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration headed by Pendergrass, the Labor Department was
scheduled to begin levying fines of up to $10,000 when the warnings
are absent.
   However, the Office of Management and Budget headed by Miller
has delayed implementation of the new requirements. The budget
office claims some of the provisions run contrary to the 1980
Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the mounting number of forms that
the government requires businesses to handle.

   A man hospitalized since being left quadriplegic

   Eugene Doran, an insurance agent and Vietnam veteran, was

1986, when he was hit by a 3-inch nail fired from a high-velocity
gun being used to install a storage chest next door.
   The settlement, reached Wednesday in the second day of a U.S.
District Court trial and described as one of the largest of its

   Glasnost has brought challenges for the Voice
of America, the U.S. government radio station reviled for years by
the Kremlin: Now that the Soviets have stopped jamming its
broadcasts, VOA has to be more interesting.
   ``We now use more actualities and music,'' VOA director Richard
Carlson said in an interview. And instead of recycling programs
several times a day to go through despite jamming, VOA now produces
fresh material for every program.
   ``We now have to be more competitive,'' Carlson said, citing
broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corp. and the more-open
Soviet media under the glasnost _ or openness _ policies of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon suspended his stalled
presidential campaign Thursday but held onto his 170 delegates in
hopes of influencing the choice of a nominee at the Democratic
national convention in July. Jesse Jackson immediately blasted
Simon for keeping the delegates, saying most of them were
rightfully his.
   ``In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows
what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' Simon
told a news conference. ``There will be many encounters with fate
before the contest is ultimately decided in a wide-open
convention.''
   In a quasi-withdrawal, Simon said he would no longer actively
campaign for the nomination but said he technically would remain a
candidate even though he conceded he has ``no illusions that the
nomination will come my way.''

   Working indoors may be hazardous to your health
after all, suggests a study that says modern, energy efficient
buildings may significantly increase the risk of communicable
respiratory infections.
   The study examined the incidence of influenza and other
respiratory illnesses among about 400,000 trainees at four Army
training centers in the southeast and south-central United States
from October 1982 to September 1986. But the researchers said the
findings may apply to office buildings and other structures
designed for maximum energy efficiency.
   Researchers found that trainees housed in modern barracks were
about 50 percent more likely to contract a respiratory infection
during the seven-week basic training period than those who stayed
in older, more drafty buildings.

be a biological rhythm set at birth and continued throughout life,
researchers say.
   In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, three
researchers said they found that extremely inhibited children
actually experience an increased heartbeat, a dilation of the
pupils and a tensing of muscles when confronted by strangers or
other social stresses.
   ``It appears that a small percentage of children are born with a
biological disposition that would tend to make them shy, and this
is independent of what the parent has or has not done,'' said
Steven Reznick, a Yale University psychologist.

<HEAD>ABC Drug Documentary a Combo Effort With Affiliates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When ABC News decided to do a documentary on
just how pervasive the drug problem is all across the country, the
result was an unusual collaboration between the network and about
40 of its affiliates.
   ``Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land,'' airs Sunday on ABC. It is
anchored by ABC's Peter Jennings and features several network
correspondents, but includes on-camera reports by local
correspondents as well as a lot of affiliate-provided tape.
   The opening montage, set to the urgent rock beat of Wang Chung,
includes footage from 14 affiliates showing drug busts in small
towns, drug busts in big cities, police breaking into crack houses
and emergency workers picking up victims of drug-related gang wars.
   ``What we have done for the first time, I think, is created a
news network division as opposed to network news division,'' said
executive producer Av Westin. ``We've put together in one place in
one hour at one time the resources of our 212 affiliates, plus the
resources of ABC News to bring to the public in a concentrated way
a clear demonstration of what drugs are doing to America.''
   CBS' ``see-it-now''-style ``48 Hours on Crack Street'' has
become the definitive drug documentary of late. ``A Plague Upon the
Land'' has a completely different focus, said Westin.
   ```48 Hours on Crack Street' made it sound like it (the drug
problem) was in one place, and it was kind of an adventure, and our
team was right in there and isn't it terrible?'' said Westin.
Although he praised the CBS documentary, he said viewers, at the
end of it, could be expected to say, ``Well, that's on 42nd Street.
That's on Crack Street. It's not in my town.'
   ``This is a call to action,'' Westin said of his documentary.
``We are angry.'' In delivering the conclusion of the documentary,
Jennings is less angry than inquiring.
   ``We don't have specific answers to the crisis we've identified
tonight,'' he says. ``But like you, we're kind of angry and we have
a lot of questions. If this is a war on drugs, and everyone from
the president on down has called it that, shouldn't it be fought
like a war?''
   Jennings lists, and then discounts, some of the wilder suggested
solutions _ such as the death penalty for drug dealers or
search-and-destroy missions to foreign lands that produce drugs.
   The documentary makes no attempt to ask why people, even
privileged people, take drugs in the first place, and how a society
can convince poverty-stricken, disenfranchised youths that taking
drugs, and taking money for drugs, is wrong.
   Jennings suggests presidential candidates should come up with
some answers, but he does say, ``One thing we should keep in
perspective: you can't win the war against drugs unless you attack
poverty and illiteracy. And remember, for the poor coca farmer in
Bolivia as well as the poor kid dealing drugs in our streets, it's
the only way they're making any money.''
   ``This is not a broadcast about how it comes in across the
border,'' Westin said. ``It is not a broadcast about why Americans
use it. It is a broadcast about the fact it is here in terrifying
amounts and it is destroying the fabric of America.''
   The documentary is indeed effective in demonstrating the
pervasiveness of the drug problem. It would seem if you don't get
gunned down in the cross fire of a gang war, you might get on a
plane whose pilot is under the influence or get left sitting in a
hospital emergency room with your broken arm while the staff is
occupied with restraining a psychotic PCP user.
   ``None of us is safe, no matter where you live,'' says the
father of a New York police officer who was shot to death as he
guarded the home of a drug trial witness. It was that slaying that
prompted the documentary, Westin said.
   As Westin showed a rough cut of the documentary, he provided a
running commentary: ``Local correspondent ... network correspondent
... local pictures, our correspondent ... local video ... network
video ...''
   He said the final cut of the documentary will have a graphic
crediting each affiliates, who were paid for their contributions.

<HEAD>Former State Supreme Court Chief Justice Has New Careers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``I've never been an ideologue,'' says Rose
Bird, who was voted out of office for being, in the minds of many,
exactly that.
   As a fledgling television commentator, California's former chief
justice says her biggest problem is reading cues ``with emotion and
feeling, after you've learned to be more reserved and also to be
less expressive as a jurist.''
   She's also editing a book of essays, ``A Sense of Justice,''
working on a second, more autobiographical book, and preparing for
a modest return to the legal profession as a part-time mediator.
   One subject Bird will not discuss is the state Supreme Court _
the old liberal court, cast out when she and Justices Joseph Grodin
and Cruz Reynoso were defeated in a bitter 1986 campaign, or the
current court that has been busy narrowing or undoing its
predecessor's work.
   ``I am not going to use my (television) position as an
opportunity to redo the election of 1986,'' Bird, 51, said in an
interview.
   ``I said from the very beginning that I was placed under a
microscope and allowed no breathing room when I was placed on the
court. I would not do that to anybody else. For over a year I have
not made any comments on the new court. I'd never put anybody
through what I went through.''
   Her second book will be ``a historical analysis of what took
place and why'' in the election, she said, but added, ``I'd like to
see some years pass before that is published.''
   A public defender, law professor and state cabinet officer
before her appointment in 1977, Bird is resuming her legal career
by joining a Burlingame, Calif., firm, Dispute Mediation Services,
that will negotiate out-of-court agreements in business and
labor-management disputes. Other mediators will include former
court colleagues Grodin, now a law professor, and Reynoso, a
Sacramento-based lawyer.
   In February, she ended a year of virtual public invisibility by
becoming a twice-a-week commentator on evening news programs on
KGO-TV in San Francisco and KABC-TV in Los Angeles.
   Advertised in advance by KABC as ``the most controversial woman
in California,'' Bird was portrayed by both stations as a liberal
counterpart to Bruce Herschensohn, a former Republican U.S. Senate
candidate who appears on two other days.
   But while a typical recent Herschensohn commentary found
numerous similarities between the Democratic and communist
platforms on Central America, Bird has been far less partisan.
   Her topics have sometimes been provocative _ the power of the
press, the destruction of rain forests, the World War II internment
of Japanese-Americans.
   But her conclusions have generally been mild _ the press should
be aware of its influence, people should ``treat the Earth with the
respect it deserves,'' the internment must never happen again.
   Bird's tribute to the Japanese-Americans in her first show, in
the form of a poem she had written and recited publicly several
years earlier, got some critical catcalls.
   ``A Rose in prose would be much sweeter,'' declared TV critic
John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle, who also advised her to
try ``less-safe topics.''
   But recently, Howard Rosenberg, the Los Angeles Times' TV
columnist, described her commentaries as ``forceful, thoughtful and
eloquent'' and said she was offering viewers ``her version of the
big picture.''
   ``Rather than comment so much on political issues and tell
people how to think about them, I'd rather comment on more of the
human condition,'' Bird said. ``I just am not a rabid person who
believes there's one way to look at things.''
   That self-assessment seems to fit her television presence. But
it might shock anyone whose impressions of Bird were formed in the
1986 election, when she was portrayed by opponents as a rigid,
ideologically driven opponent of the death penalty, law and order,
and judicial restraint.
   An overwhelming majority of viewer responses were negative at
first, but now include nearly an equal amount of praise. Many
comments have focused on who Bird was rather than on what she has
said.
   One writer from Petaluma promised to stop watching KGO-TV if it
continued to show ``THAT creature who was the friend of
criminals.'' A Berkeley resident cited the death penalty, a subject
Bird has not mentioned on the air.
   ``The response has been tremendous, both positive and
negative,'' said Terry Crofoot, news director of KABC-TV. ``It's
good TV, that there's something to react to.''
   Bird gets little editing on her two-minute scripts, but plenty
of coaching on her television delivery.
   She is ``tentative right now'' but writes well and learns fast,
said Andrew Shinnick, the assistant news director in charge of the
6 o'clock news at KGO-TV. ``She's fun to have around a newsroom.''
   The job has given the former chief justice a better
understanding of the reporters who used to cover her. ``With
deadlines and one-day stories,'' she said, ``it presents enormous
problems in trying to give depth and full coverage, where everybody
wants to know at the moment what the headline is.''

<BYLINE>Did You Pay The Cleaning Woman's Social Security?

<TEXT>
   If you employ a cleaning person on a regular
basis you must deduct Social Security taxes of 7.51 percent from
the paycheck and, in addition, contribute a like amount as the
employee's portion of the tax.
   This is one of the touchiest areas of American tax policy. Many
employers of household help are ignorant of their obligations. Many
domestics are equally unaware. And in many instances, either side
elects to ignore the obligations.
   But those obligations, and others, are very real. They could
lead to fines. They could lead to more costly problems if an
ex-employee sues to reclaim benefits that should have been paid,
but were not, over a period of years.
   It is a growing challenge to families, since many are able to
exist only by having two breadwinners, each working at a fulltime
job and therefore unable to handle household chores without the
help of a domestic.
   Since there is already enough confusion about the obligations of
those who employ domestics, a concerned household should describe
its specific situation and accept guidance from an accountant or
tax authority.
   The key word is ``employee.'' A young person who rakes your lawn
once a year isn't an employee. But a domestic who cleans your house
once a week is almost certainly an employee for whom you must pay
taxes.
   Specialists at Spicer & Oppenheim, an accounting and tax firm,
define a domestic as someone who performs service in or about a
private home, including housekeepers, maids, cooks and babysitters.
   Payments made for the performance of such services are generally
subject to the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or Social
Security.
   An exclusion exists, says the accounting firm, for all payments
under $50 made to an individual for occasional domestic help during
a calendar quarter. Also excluded are payments in the form of
lodging or meals.
   Otherwise, you might be liable _ and, again, it is wise to check
with an accountant or tax adviser about your specific case _ for
deducting your employee's portion of FICA and adding in the
employer's identical FICA payment.
   Your tax responsibilities might not end there either. You might
also be responsible for collecting both federal and state
unemployment taxes.
   Wages paid for domestic service are subject to federal
unemployment tax, says the firm, if cash paid to a performer of
domestic service totals $1,000 or more in any quarter of a taxable
year, or in a preceding taxable year. The maximum tax rate is 6.2
percent of the first $7,000 in wages.
   For state unemployment tax purposes, each state establishes its
own quarterly requirements. But, whatever is paid to the state may
earn a credit deductable from the federal tax.
   Almost needless to say, one reason many households ignore these
tax laws is that they have more paperwork than time in which to do
it, and more legal and financial complications than they feel
competent to contend with.
   There is a way out of this one if you hire domestic help through
an agency in the business of furnishing the actual services. Then,
the agency is viewed as the employer responsible for all taxes.
   For the agency to qualify, and for you to be relieved of taxes,
the agency must claim to be in the business of providing domestic
services. It must fix compensation levels. Its income must be
derived from its employee's income.
   By that definition, a company listed with the state as an agency
that merely furnishes domestic workers to prospective employers for
a fee _ that is, an employment agency _ doesn't meet the
requirements.
   Final advisory: Check with a tax authority or an accountant
about your specific situation.

   The gullible among us believed that actor James
Dean died in the wreckage of his low-slung Porsche Spyder on a
California highway 33 years ago, but readers of Private Lives
magazine were not fooled.
   ``He didn't die. He lives on, maybe right next door to YOU. And
someday soon perhaps Jimmy, in his own way and in his own good
time, will once more come back and face the world that waits for
him,'' the magazine suggested at the time.
   Private Lives was not alone among the exploitation magazines in
suggesting in the weeks and months after Dean's accident on Sept.
30, 1955 that the 24-year-old actor was alive.
   ``I think people wanted to believe that Dean was alive,'' said
Alan Betrock, editor of ``The Best of James Dean in the Scandal
Magazines, 1955-58,'' a collection of Jamesmania from such
magazines as Whisper, On the QT, Anything Goes, Hush-Hush and
Uncensored.
   ``I think this happens whenever someone with a fairly rabid
following dies at an early age,'' Betrock said. ``Remember, after
the assassination, there were those who believed John F. Kennedy
was brain-damaged and living in the Bahamas, something that wasn't
too supported by facts.''
   Betrock has reproduced the pages of the scandal magazines in
full, along with ads for shrunken heads ``molded of virgin rubber''
and photographs of a woman named Lolita: ``If you like 'em BUXOM,
maybe you'll like my photos.''
   The articles are also accompanied by many pictures of Dean, the
wreck and shapely starlets such as Pier Angeli, Ursula Andress and
Terry Moore, who were linked romantically with the star of ``Rebel
Without a Cause'' and ``East of Eden.''
   The actor's death in the crash on old state Highway 466
transformed him from a movie actor on the brink of stardom to the
patron saint of young American rebels. His portrayals of vulnerable
and moody young men who openly expressed fear and pain became
standards for a generation.
   His mystique has endured.
   Rock songs such as the Eagle's ``James Dean,'' and David Essex's
``Rock On'' evoke his name. The movie ``9-30-55'' studied the
reactions of contemporary fans to Dean's death. A Broadway play,
``Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean,'' took
aim at the hopeless nostalgia created by some fans.
   Some magazines knocked the ``Dean is not dead'' stories. Lowdown
magazine reported that the deceased Dean received 8,000 love
letters a month. ``This is gruesome mental illness of the
unhealthiest order,'' wrote the editor.
   To prove the point, Lowdown printed a collection of letters.
   ``My sweet darling: When night falls and my stupid fat husband
snores at my side, I hold you closely in my arms. I know you are
not dead. You are disfigured and ashamed to show your face,''
writes one woman, who promises to leave her husband and five
children and shower Dean with her $4,500 fortune.
   The scandal magazines covered every angle. On the QT asked,
``Did Jimmy Dean leave a son? A persistent story coming out of
Hollywood claims that the teen idol fathered a carhop's baby
shortly before he died.''
   Did he commit suicide? Did black magic woven by ex-girlfriend
Myla Nurmi, a Los Angeles TV personality also known as Vampira,
have anything to do with the wreck? Did Dean steal an Oscar from
Frank Sinatra? These questions are posed and authoritative answers
are posited.
   A whole slew of articles purport to be the accounts,
first-person and otherwise, of Dean's secret friend, fiancee or
wife. Most of them are pictured wearing few clothes.
   ``He told her, `You know, in Hollywood I see the most glamorous
girls in the world. Expensive faces and bodies. But you're
wholesome and like a good piece of bread to a hungry man. You're
like sweet well water to a thirsty man.' That's the way he always
spoke to Betty Lou,'' Lowdown reported.
   Betrock, who previously edited ``The I Was a Teen-Age Juvenile
Delinquent Rock 'n' Roll Horror Beach Party Movie Book,'' does not
take all of this very seriously. The book's cover promises that its
contents are ``Exclusive! Amazing! Fully Illustrated! Possibly
True!''
   But Betrock says the sordidness of the Dean stories makes an
important point about a time that is often portrayed as an era of
sweetness and naivete.
   ``I've always been interested in the darker side of popular
culture,'' the 37-year-old record producer and editor said. ``The
1950s are often described in terms of Eisenhower and hula-hoops,
but there was a whole undercurrent, the underbelly of Americana.''

<HEAD>Theater Group Gives Former Prisoners Chance to Make Clean Break</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rena Owen remembers the 2,022 bricks in her tiny
cell. Sue Rossiter can still hear the clink of locks and keys. The
sights and sounds of prison are vivid years later.
   Owen and Rossiter, both jailed on drug charges, don't forget.
Through an unusual theater group called Clean Break, they and other
female ex-offenders are leaving their experiences behind by putting
them on the stage.
   Begun nine years ago in a British prison, Clean Break has grown
into a theater group which has toured in the United States and
Europe, performed on the Royal Shakespeare Company's London stage
and produced more than a dozen plays.
   For the women, it's a chance to perform, to produce plays about
the traumas of lives that led to jail sentences and, most of all,
an opportunity to speak out about an experience many others try to
hide.
   ``One of the most important things women can't do when they come
out of prison is articulate their experience,'' says Chris
Tchaikovsky, who helps run a reform group called Women in Prison
and wrote one Clean Break play.
   Prison ``floats around in the back of your head,'' she says.
``If people can articulate crime it puts it behind you, and Clean
Break makes a unique contribution.
   ``Apart from that, it's great fun,'' adds Tchaikovsky, who
served three years for check fraud. ``It's not everyone sitting
around thinking, `God, I'm a victim.'''
   Still, prison life is not the stuff of comedy.
   Britain has only 1,755 women in jail, out of a total prison
population of nearly 49,000 cramped into an overcrowded prison
network.
   But women prisoners are disciplined twice as often as men, are
punished more often for violence and injure themselves more often
than men, studies by the private National Association for the Care
and Resettlement of Offenders (NACRO) show.
   ``Women's prisons have never really been considered; they're run
like men's prisons but with women in them,'' says NACRO spokeswoman
Jill Matthews.
   ``The main question is why are they there,'' she says. ``It's
terribly expensive, it's so destructive, it's such a waste. This is
true for men but more true for women.''
   Jenny Hicks, who co-founded Clean Break in 1979 with a fellow
inmate, Jackie Holborough, at a low-security prison, says leaving
jail doesn't mean the problems end.
   Hicks and Holborough, with the support of a liberal warden at
Askhams Grange prison, expanded the annual Christmas show into a
theater workshop, then a troupe. With a 21-strong group, they
became the first British prisoners to perform outside jail,
presenting a play in Edinburgh. Of the group, only Holborough had
had any prior experience in the theater.
   ``It was an absolutely freeing activity from the bordom and
general uselessness of prison,'' Hicks said.
   Now, Hicks works mainly with Creative and Supportive Trust
(CAST), a group for ex-offenders that shares Clean Break's drafty
basement rooms in London and is closely allied with the theater
group.
   Most productions have small casts and a barren set, and Clean
Break can afford only one annual tour of London fringe theaters.
However, the actresses have union cards and salaries, and the
group, which numbers about 30 permanent members, has expanded its
activities.
   With its first public grant in 1986, Clean Break took
Holborough's play ``The Sin Eaters'' on an American tour including
stops in New York, an Iowa prison and a Boston women's festival. It
has also toured in Amsterdam.
   The group has performed at psychiatric hospitals, drug and
alcohol rehabiliation centers and detention centers, opened its
ranks to former inmates and sought the help of several professional
actresses.
   Ann Mitchell, a former Royal Shakespeare Company actress who
worked on ``The Sin Eaters,'' has for more than a year led writing
workshops with therapist Kate Hall.
   Last year, she combined a cast of RSC and Clean Break actresses
in performing a collection of writings from both former and current
prisoners called ``Voices From Prison'' at the Barbican, the London
stage of the RSC.
   Mitchell also recently directed the latest production affiliated
with Clean Break, 27-year-old Rena Owen's passionate account of how
the therapy she demanded in prison helped her accept her heritage
as a Maori, the indigenous minority of New Zealand.
   As Clean Break enters its ninth year, those involved question
whether its main role is theatrical or therapeutic.
   Still, for many, Clean Break remains a dramatic help.
   ``It's a refuge,'' says Sue Rossiter. ``It was real therapy.''

<TEXT>
   When Delain Lindgren of Choteau, Mont.,
became pregnant last year, she called her local doctor _ and
learned he'd dropped obstetrical services to save on spiraling
malpractice insurance costs.
   He was the last doctor delivering babies in the town of 1,700,
so Mrs. Lindgren had no choice but to look for a doctor in Great
Falls, a 100-mile round trip.
   Even there, she found few doctors taking new patients. ``I had
to wait three months before I could see one.''
   But nine days before her first appointment, her baby was born at
home, three months premature. The 2-pound, 15-ounce girl was taken
in the Jan. 4 cold to the Choteau hospital, airlifted to Great
Falls and later transferred to a Salt Lake City hospital, where she
remains while her lungs develop further.
   Mrs. Lindgren is one of many women affected by a national shift
by doctors abandoning obstetrical services, many citing malpractice
costs. For women in large metropolitan areas it's an inconvenience;
in the country it can mean life or death.
   ``It happens in cities, but when it happens in cities, there are
plenty of alternatives around. When it happens in rural areas,
already there aren't very many doctors providing that care,'' said
Robert Van Hook, executive director of the National Rural Health
Association.
   He said there have been informal discussions in Congress about
the possible use of special pools of doctors from the National
Health Service Corps to assist hard-hit areas.
   ``Somebody's going to have to do something pretty soon, or we're
going to end up having to rebuild those systems of care out
there,'' he said. ``We're concerned that ... we'll end up with
higher infant mortality.''
   A survey last year by the American Academy of Family Physicians
found that just over half of its members who delivered babies had
stopped doing so, said Mike Miller, the organization's general
counsel. One-third of those who quit blamed malpractice insurance
costs.
   ``We're very concerned,'' Miller said. ``The whole concept of a
family doctor is to take care of the whole family. The big area of
concern is in some of these isolated areas.''
   Not everyone agrees malpractice coverage is the villain, and yet
the national average annual premium for doctors delivering babies
has risen from $10,946 in 1982 to $37,015 now, according to the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Premiums
average $52,000 in Florida and New York, spokeswoman Teri Malone
said.
   She said about 12 percent of OB-GYNs each year stop doing
deliveries, and that the age at which they stop is getting lower.
   Mirroring the national trends is Montana.
   At least 60 of the approximately 250 doctors delivering babies
in the state three years ago have quit that service, according to
the Montana Academy of Family Physicians.
   The vast expanse of rural Montana has never enjoyed an abundance
of physicians. Now, there is too often a disheartening search for
medical care that is basic yet unattainable.
   In Malta, on the north central plains, only a part-time
obstetrician remains. Women travel 90 miles to Havre or 70 miles to
Glasgow to see a doctor who delivers babies.
   In Thompson Falls, in the western mountains, no doctors do so.
The journey is 100 miles to Missoula or 90 miles to Sandpoint,
Idaho.
   Montana doctors say they are victims as well, paying soaring
rates despite the fact that none has been hit by a fabled
multimillion-dollar verdict.
   Insurance executives say they've been forced to increase rates
not only to cover the higher and more frequent settlements in
malpractic suits, but also to build up reserves in anticipation of
future damages.
   But doctors pay the tab despite flawless records.
   Four years ago, Dr. Jim Ashcraft of Sidney, Mont., paid about
$7,000 for a malpractice insurance policy that covered claims made
at any time for treatment he performed that year. This year, he
faced a $19,500 insurance premium that would cover him only for
claims brought by the end of the year.
   If he quit the practice, he would have to pay an additional
$36,000 to cover any claims brought in the future.
   In 12 years of practice, Ashcraft has never been sued for
malpractice in connection with a delivery.
   Such cases are rare in Montana, in fact. But malpractice claims
and payouts for obstetrical cases have been increasing here. And
insurers point to those increases to justify their rates.
   ``Obstetrics are our loss leader without question,'' said Martin
Oslowski, president of Utah Medical Insurance Association, which
insures about 200 doctors in Montana. ``It's probably damn near
everyone's loss leader.''
   About 15 percent of the malpractice claims in Montana in the
last five years have been obstetric cases, but Oslowski said such
cases accounted for 25 percent to 50 percent of insurance losses.
   Precise figures on losses in Montana obstetrical cases are not
readily available. But insurers say it is the fear of huge verdicts
that not only forces them to charge higher premiums, but also to
settle malpractice claims out of court frequently.
   Figures compiled by the Montana Medical Association show that
since 1982, actual payments to malpractice claimants in the state
rose steadily from $1 million that year to a high of $3.8 million
in 1985. They dropped to $3.3 million in 1986.
   Doctors and their insurers want to deal with the problem by
altering the legal system that resolves torts, or wrongful acts,
such as medical malpractice. They say if tort reform is enacted to
make the system more predictable, insurance rates will stabilize or
drop.
   An advisory council appointed by Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden is
studying the issue and most likely will recommend tort-reform
measures to the 1989 Legislature.
   But others question whether the rate increases are justified and
whether reforming the system will really solve the problem of
costly insurance or doctors quitting obstetrical services.
   Dr. Sydney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research
Group in Washington, D.C., said many physicians stop delivering
babies because of the inconvenience of being on call at all hours.
``It's easy to blame everything on the malpractice insurance
crisis, but it ain't so,'' he said.
   Karl Englund, an attorney representing the Montana Trial Lawyers
Association, added, ``Everyone has looked at (the problem) only in
terms of tort reform. That may result in lowering of insurance
rates for doctors ... But it certainly doesn't solve the whole
problem of the availability of health care in rural communities.''
   That problem may not be solved until lawmakers feel the pressure
from women who need medical care and can't find it, said Plains
physician Jacob Lulack.
   ``If you took a thousand pregnant women and had them sit on the
Capitol steps, we'd have this problem solved in a minute,'' said
Lulack.

<DATELINE>ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Glen Kaye gets paid
federal tax dollars to serve the American people as chief
naturalist for Rocky Mountain National Park.
   He helps the 2.7 million citizen bosses who visit each year to
understand the 414 square miles of national patrimony located 75
miles northwest of Denver.
   It's Kaye's job to tell us what it all means: What are those
funny looking birds? Will this mushroom kill me if I eat it? What
time do the rangers turn off the waterfalls?
   His is a five-page, single-spaced job description. He supervises
two visitor centers, two museums, four amphitheaters, two
information booths, a 2,000-volume library and an outpouring of new
books and pamphlets; oversees six park employees, more than 30
seasonal workers and 50 volunteers, and administers an annual
budget of $400,000.
   He is park spokesman for good news, such as international
wilderness conferences, and bad news, such as people falling off
mountains.
   A 25-year veteran of the U.S. government, he earns $43,891
annually and lives with his wife, Harriet, a pianist and caterer,
and their two teen-age children, in a government-owned house five
minutes' walk from his office. His burning ambition is to return to
Hawaii, ideally as a park superintendent.
   Assigned for five years to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Kaye
says: ``I left my heart there. It's the first place on Earth that
really sang to me.''
   But the return will have to wait. In mid-May, Kaye begins work
as chief of interpretation for the park service's Southwest region.
He'll be based in Santa Fe, N.M., a beautiful place, even if not
his paradise.
   If Glen Kaye didn't exist, Woody Allen would invent him.
   At 46, he reports for work dressed like the Boy Scout he once
was, yet often spends his days immersed in cosmic dilemmas such as
the future of the ozone layer.
   He is an acrophobic who tries, and fails, to overcome his fear
of heights by climbing mountains.
   A painter of tropical scenes, a wearer of Hawaiian shirts, Kaye
lives in a landlocked alpine valley where winter lasts seven months.
   He describes himself as a diffident man, yet he boldly creates
five-year plans for his department. Tall and gangly, with a monk's
fringe of hair, he is a solitary outdoorsman but seizes every
opportunity to attend grand opera with crowds.
   Growing up in Medford, Ore., Kaye decided he wanted to spend his
adulthood in the outdoors. So, straight out of Oregon State
University in 1963, he joined the park service as a naturalist at
Crater Lake National Park.
   There weren't many interpreters back then.
   ``Rangers were hugging trees or working with three spine
sticklebacks (an ugly little fish). They weren't big on people or
communications skills.''
   Today hundreds of workers on the federal payroll do nothing but
explain the nation's parks to its people.
   ``What I try to do is get people to realize a park is not
protected by boundaries on paper and a handful of rangers,'' Kaye
said. ``But we can't go out and say, `YOU MUST SAVE THIS NATIONAL
PARK!'
   ``We must lay out information and let people make up their own
minds. In the long run, parks are protected by the peer attitudes
of society.''
   Kaye believes one of the best ways to educate Americans about
their natural treasures is through art. That notion, and an old log
cabin, inspired him to create Rocky Mountain National Park's
artist-in-residence program in 1984.
   The cabin, once owned by the late Kansas newspaper editor
William Allen White, has a breathtaking view of 14,255-foot Long's
Peak. Every summer Kaye selects ``creators and communicators'' to
spend from one to three weeks in the cabin, doing their own thing.
The park provides housing and firewood, guests provide groceries.
   ``Glen broke through the inertia of `This is the way we've
always done it' and came up with a great idea,'' said Bill Sontag,
chief of the park service's Rocky Mountain region interpretation
office in Denver.
   Sontag attributed the program's success to Kaye's enthusiasm _
he raised money for the restoration and contributed his own elbow
grease _ but added, ``There are quite a lot of those folks in
government.''
   Participating last summer were four journalists, three artists,
two composers, a photographer, a writer and an actor.
   ``Artists need time to goof around, and Glen understands that,''
said Paul Sullivan, a New York pianist and composer who stayed in
the cabin after he was commissioned to create a score for a park
service film.
   Sullivan taped wildlife, water and wind sounds to help him write
a piano composition. He also practiced daily on the piano Kaye
moved into the house for his tenure.
   ``The cabin was offered with no strings attached. The guy was
genuinely offering an experience to us to see what we would do with
it,'' Sullivan said. ``At first it seemed too good to be true, but
I learned that Glen Kaye is a truly gentle man who has a very
sincere respect for artists.''
   Sullivan plans to return to the park later this year to premier
his musical work.
   ``This is the best thing the United States has ever done for me
personally,'' the pianist said, speaking of the opportunity Kaye's
program presented. ``I feel I've been given a great gift.''
   Art, Kaye says, has helped change Americans' perception of their
land _ ``from fear and loathing of wilderness to embracing and
positively administering it.''
   Kaye writes magazine articles and a column in the local
newspaper. In one recent piece, he gently warned readers about
world overpopulation and dwindling natural resources, and cautioned
of a growing scarcity for future generations.
   He wished them freedom from the regimentation of overcrowding,
access to beauty in nature, clean air and water, and the
opportunity to achieve their potential.
   ``Above all,'' he concluded, ``I want them to know of their
history and their responsibility, for in their action is the future
of their lives.''

   Sometimes its hard to get from Frogfuzz
Junction over to Blitz Center where the courthouse is. Or up to
Wrathgrape Falls where Aunt Sophie Lou has the family in for Sunday
dinner now and then.
   Most often rural people who are too poor or infirm to drive a
car have to find a friend or relative to take them around. You
don't trot or teeter down to the corner to catch a bus or train
because there aren't any.
   And sometimes people who live in the countryside, in the
thousands of small towns and hamlets that make up rural America,
simply stay home when they're lonely or really should see a doctor.
   Railroad whistle-stop passenger service, the ``local'' or milk
train of yesteryear, has long passed into history. Stagecoaches
mostly gave way to buses by World War I, and even the buses are now
becoming hard to find.
   ``Increasingly, if one lives in a rural community, efficient bus
service may be only a distant memory, nor may rail or air service
be available,'' says the Agriculture Department.
   That's why USDA's Office of Transportation and the Department of
Transportation's Urban Mass Transportation Administration are
joining with the United Bus Owners of America to discuss a solution
to rural transportation problems.
   Two regional meetings will be held this spring, in Annapolis,
Md., April 20-22, and in San Francisco, Calif., May 18-20. A
national conference will be held in August in Omaha, Neb.
   Ellen Stommes of USDA's Office of Transportation said the
government's major financial aid involves the ``Section 18'' funds
provided states by the Department of Transportation (DOT) under the
Urban Mass Transportation Act.
   The money has totaled around $75 million annually and is
apportioned to states under a formula to help improve passenger
transportation systems available to rural people.
   No increase in federal money is being talked about at this
point, Ms. Stommes said in an interview. Instead, she said, the
conferences will be focusing on ``coordinating the resources that
are out there and trying to bring together the private and public
sectors.''
   It's sort of a hodge-podge of programs right now.
   States are contributing to rural transportation programs, along
with the federal government. Local transportation providers, mostly
non-profit groups, often have authority to operated within a single
county or a certain multi-county region.
   To some extent, these contract with human services agencies to
provide specialized transportation, to health facilities, for
example. But in order to qualify for Section 18 funds, general
public transportation must also be provided.
   ``One of the things that we're trying to encourage ... is the
coordination of schedules between these providers and the intercity
carriers,'' Ms. Stommes said. ``That is not happening in a great
many places.''
   But there are exceptions, she said.
   For example, ``Greyound is establishing what they call their
rural connector program, in which local or non-profit providers are
feeding their passengers into the intercity network,'' Ms. Stommes
said.
   Improving rural transportation is not a new or novel idea. It
has been the goal of countless community efforts since Americans
started heading West. Any small-town Chamber of Commerce worth its
salt has had a plan, prospectus or lobbying effort on behalf of
gaining or keeping its railroad service, bus station or airport.
   Much work already has been done at the federal level. In the
Carter administration, a White House Rural Development Initiatives
project included ``ways to overcome isolation by improving
transportation in rural America.''
   The Farmers Home Administration of USDA in 1979 took the lead
with the National Council for the Transportation Disadvantaged in
turning out a handbook, Rural Rides, for starting and operating a
rural public transportation system.
   A point made by the 1979 handbook is the relatively scant amount
of federal money available for rural transportation: although
nearly 30 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only
about 1 percent of the federal money spent on public transportation
goes to rural needs.
   The handbook, although dated in many ways, sounded a call for
coordinating the fragmented transportation services that did exist
_ exactly what Ms. Stommes said is one of the priorities of the
1988 effort.
   ``Coordination is good for the taxpayers and contributors who
foot the ultimate bill because waste, inefficiency and duplication
of effort should be eliminated,'' the handbook said. ``And it's
good for everybody in the participating town, county or area
because the savings can be passed on to the public in the form of
increased transportation services.''

service in rural areas, contact: Eileen Stommes, Office of
Transportation, USDA, P.O. Box 96575, Washington, D.C. 20090-6575.

<HEAD>Britain Baffled by Deaths of 10 Scientists Involved in Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since August 1986, 10 British scientists, all with
some connection to security projects or establishments, have died
in unusual circumstances.
   There is no evidence _ or at least evidence that has been
disclosed _ of a direct link, or a cloak-and-dagger conspiracy, but
the deaths have baffled coroners, the widows, politicians and
others who cannot believe it is merely a coincidence.
   Opposition lawmakers have called without success for a
government investigation into the so-called ``Mystery of the Dead
Scientists.'' The authorities deny there is any mystery.
   ``Is it simply overwork, or is there something more sinister
afoot?'' asked Labor Party lawmaker Doug Hoyle after the latest
death _ that of a computer engineer working on guided missile
research; he was found dead March 25 in a fume-filled car.
   ``It is very alarming,'' said Hoyle. ``What is the link between
all these?''
   The government acknowledges the string of unexplained deaths is
odd, but says investigations have been left to the police.
   Computer News, a respected industry periodical, has conducted an
investigation and plans to release a detailed report shortly.
   What does link the scientists, other than their connection to
the sometimes murky world of defense or security work?
   _All 10 victims were men.
   _Four were in their early 20s.
   _All died in southern England, some far from their homes.
   _Five worked for Marconi or its related companies. Marconi is an
electronics subsidiary of the General Electric Co., a leading
defense contractor not related to the American company.
   _Four worked for British government or military installations.
   Most of the deaths resemble suicides, although only two have
been ruled as such so by inquests. In several cases the families
said the scientists suffered from nothing more than overwork.
   The mystery began Aug. 5, 1986, when Vimal Dajibhai, 24, was
found dead in the gorge below Clifton Bridge near Bristol,
southwest England. Suicide was suspected, but a coroner's inquest
reached no decision about the cause of death.
   In the next eight months, until April 1987, there seven more
deaths, then a lull until one each this February and March.
   Dajibhai was a junior engineer checking torpedo guidance systems
for Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd. near London. No one has
determined what he was doing in Bristol, 105 miles away.
   Three months after Dajibhai's death, Ashhad Sharif, a computer
systems analyst working on a defense project for another Marconi
unit near London, died in a park near Bristol.
   An inquest ruled that Sharif, 26, killed himself by tying a rope
to a tree, looping the other end around his neck and then driving
off in his car at high speed.
   Coroner Donald Hawkins called it suicide, but he, too, wondered
why it happened in Bristol.
   In January 1987, computer designer Richard Pugh was found dead
in his home east of London. The circumstances were never explained,
but a jury ruled it was accidental death during sexual
experimentation. Pugh, 37, had previously worked on Defense
Ministry contracts.
   Also that month, John Brittam, a 52-year-old computer expert at
the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment, was
found dead in his garage with his car engine running. Brittam
previously worked for the Royal Military College of Sciene.
   A month later, a senior metallurgy lecturer at the college,
Peter Peapell, was found dead under his car with the engine
running. The government said Peapell, 46, was working on an
unclassified project studying recent trends in beryllium in the
Soviet Union.
   In March 1987, computer expert David Sands drove his car, its
trunk loaded with tanks of gasoline, into a vacant restaurant and
was burned to death. Sands, 37, worked for Easams, a Marconi
associate, on a tender for an air defense systems contract.
   John Cartwright, another Labor Party member of Parliament,
called for a government investigation following Sands' death.
   He wrote in a letter to the Conservative government: ``I do not
wish to be accused of inventing plots more suited to a TV thriller
than real life, but I think the circumstances of these ... cases
stretch the possibility of mere coincidence too far.''
   In April 1987 two more scientists were found dead.
   One was Mark Wisner, 25, a computer specialist at a Royal Air
Force weapons-testing base, who an inquest ruled committed suicide
by placing a plastic bag over his head. The other was a Marconi
scientist, Victor Moore, 46, who an inquest determined died of a
drug overdose.
   Wisner was working on computer software for the Tornado fighter
plane and Moore had worked on a night vision project for the
British army.
   The mysterious deaths stopped until this past Feb. 2, when
police found the body of Russell Smith, a 23-year-old junior
scientist, halfway down a cliff. Police said they found a note in
his car in a cliff-top park but refused to say what was in the
note. They have declined to speculate on the cause of his death.
   Smith worked for the ultra-secret United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority in Harwell. No one has determined why he was at Land's
End, 150 miles from Harwell.
   Finally, on March 25, another Marconi employee, 52-year-old
Trevor Knight, was found dead in his fume-filled car in Harpender,
25 miles northwest of London. He was a computer engineer working on
guided missile research at Marconi headquarters.

   Edna DiNola has trouble recreating the
jumbled events of April 10, 1963, the night she was told the USS
Thresher, a nuclear submarine carrying her husband and 128 other
men, had not resurfaced from a dive 220 miles off the New England
coast.
   She isn't quite sure who came to her home or what they said. She
thinks friends helped put her five children to bed and turned away
reporters clamoring for reaction. She thinks a Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard chaplain told her he would be there if she needed him.
   There is one thing, however, DiNola did remember as she
reflected last week on Sunday's 25th anniversary of the nation's
worst submarine disaster: ``I just didn't think that they wouldn't
come up again.''
   But the submarine, powerless with a crippled nuclear reactor,
never had a chance, sinking deeper and deeper in the Atlantic until
fierce water pressure crushed its hull and killed all aboard.
   Rear Adm. Dean Axene, Thresher's commanding officer until three
months earlier, was returning to Portsmouth from Boston when he
heard on the radio a submarine was missing.
   He drove immediately to the shipyard, which Thresher had left
two days earlier.
   After midnight, Axene began calling family members, many of whom
were close friends and had faith in the 278-foot submarine that the
Navy said could ``dive deeper, move faster and carry more weapons
than any other submarine in the fleet.''
   ``It was a great ship and it had a great crew,'' he said. ``When
I was reassigned, I fought to stay on it.''
   Thresher had three years of success when it left for tests the
morning of April 8. Accompanied by the submarine tender Skylark,
Thresher's 112 military personnel and 17 civilian technicians were
looking for minor glitches in the machinery after a routine
overhaul.
   But the problems were more severe than anyone suspected.
   At 9:02 a.m. on April 10, the Skylark received a message from
Thresher, 1,000 feet below the surface: ``Experiencing minor
difficulties.''
   Garbled radio messages followed saying Thresher was ``exceeding
test depth,'' then ``attempting to blow,'' a naval term for
resurfacing.
   At 9:17, Lt. Jim Watson, listening to Skylark's radio, ``heard
the sounds of a ship breaking up _ a dull, muted roar.''
   Then silence.
   Skylark radioed that Thresher was missing.
   ``It was a terrible experience, a terrible thing,'' Axene, now
retired and living in Pensacola, Fla., said of calling crew
families. He plans to attend Sunday's memorial services for the
first time in 24 years, but the memories are still too painful for
his wife.
   Some crewmen's wives, like DiNola, didn't believe Thresher was
lost and told reporters to print the good news when their husbands
returned.
   DiNola finally went to bed that night. ``I had three babies (and
two other children) and they had to be taken care of, so you just
go on,'' she said.
   Although the Navy told her the sub was lost, she told shipyard
officials to leave her husband's car waiting at the pier.
   ``You would think that you would react immediately to something
like this, but you don't,'' she said.
   DiNola wasn't alone. Some speculated that crewmen might be
alive, sustained by air bubbles trapped in the wreckage. Another
sub detected what some believed were hull noises, prompting the
secretary of the Navy to declare the night after the tragedy that
``there is absolutely no possibility that there might be
survivors.''
   But the truth didn't register with DiNola until days later when
friends told her ships had spotted an oil slick _ the telltale sign
of wreckage.
   ``I finally realized what was happening, and I went into
orbit,'' she said.
   A Navy board of inquiry pieced together what went wrong.
   The board considered 120 witnesses, 225 exhibits and 1,700 pages
of testimony before concluding problems probably started with a
leak in the saltwater piping. The board said water had shorted out
electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor, leaving
Thresher powerless.
   ``The Thresher presumably blew main ballast, started to rise,
then slowed and began to sink,'' Vice Adm. E.W. Grenfell wrote in a
1964 analysis of the disaster.
   When the sub sank below its ``collapse depth,'' water pressure
crushed the hull.
   In August 1964, a research submarine found and photographed the
wreckage, about 1{ miles down. A witness described the ocean floor
as resembling ``a huge automobile junkyard with big pieces of heavy
metal all over the place.''
   Thresher's sole surviving crew member, who took leave just
before the sub left because his wife had had an accident, said he
still believes the submarine could have been saved.
   Raymond McCoole, Thresher's reactor officer, said he might have
been able to use the sub's momentum to prevent its plunge. He would
have sacrificed the reactor to save the submarine, he said.
   After Thresher, the Navy developed a submarine safety program
based on the board's findings. The program includes strict
construction methods and testing for saltwater piping, more initial
shallow-water sea trials and design improvements.
   ``My feeling is that progress is expensive and the Navy has
certainly learned from Thresher,'' McCoole said last week. ``It's a
hard way to learn, however.''
   Neil Collier, who was 4 when his father, Merrill, perished,
agreed.
   ``A lot of good came out of that sad day,'' said Collier, who
spent three years on a submarine himself and now is an instructor
at a Navy training center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
   Collier has read names of the dead at several Thresher services
and helped plan this year's service, expected to be the largest
since the tragedy.
   Despite the pain of growing up without his father, Collier said
mourning isn't the main purpose of the service.
   ``I take the memorial service very seriously and it's a big deal
to me every year,'' he said. ``But from my point of view, the
Thresher incident and what impact it had on national defense is
really why it's important.
   ``It made subs a lot safer. Many, many lives have been saved
because those guys gave their lives.''
   DiNola will be at Sunday's service. After working years in a
school lunch program and as a nurse, DiNola decided in 1986 to
honor her husband with a plaque in Arlington National Cemetery.
   ``I finally decided it was time to have our own service'' for
Michael, she said. ``I felt that by then everyone would understand
the situation.''
   Aided by veterans benefits and Social Security, DiNola has
raised her family. This spring, her last child will graduate from
college.
   ``You do what you have to, and the good Lord guides you,'' she
said.

close at 2,061.67 Wednesday _ the biggest rise since it climbed
76.42 points Jan. 4.
   The Dow's advance was so strong it triggered a 50-point

   A stronger dollar and weaker interest rates sparked Wall
Street's second best day of 1988, with stock prices rising so
strongly they triggered the New York Stock Exchange's self-imposed
limits on one type of trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 64.16 points to
2,061.67 on Wednesday, its biggest gain since the widely-watched
market barometer rose 76.42 points on Jan. 4, the year's first
trading day.
   In Wednesday's only major economic report, Detroit's Big Three
automakers reported that dealer sales incentives paid off with
strong late-March and first-quarter sales increases.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, nearly three stocks rose in
price for every one that declined as Big Board volume rose to
189.76 million shares, from Tuesday's 135.29 million.
   By swinging more than 50 points, the Dow industrials triggered
an NYSE restriction on computerized program trading for the first
time since the so-called ``collar'' was announced on Feb. 4.
   Program trading, a technique used to profit on price differences
between stocks traded in New York and corresponding stock-index
futures traded in Chicago futures markets, has been blamed for
injecting volatility into the market and frightening investors.
   Analysts said Wednesday's gain was due to a strengthening of the
dollar in foreign exchange, which in turn prompted a decline in
long-term interest rates in the credit markets.
   The dollar moved higher, analysts said, on speculation the major
industrial nations may be moving toward a fresh agreement to
support the U.S. currency. A meeting of the industrial powers is
planned for next week.
   The dollar rose to 126.03 Japanese yen late in New York from
125.28 yen late Tuesday.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond ended the session up
nearly $10 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely
to its price, slipped to 8.75 percent from 8.84 percent.
   In Detroit, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported more than
18 percent jumps in daily sales rates for the quarter. General
Motors Corp., the top seller, reported a nearly 10 percent rise.

   Hopes continue waning in the oil markets that an
upcoming OPEC committee meeting will result in actions to stabilize
crude prices.
   In quiet trading Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil futures prices finished marginally higher while refined
oil products were mixed.
   Contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, edged up 2 cents per barrel to $16.81. Other
contract months gained between 1 cent and 3 cents.
   Among refined products, wholesale heating oil for May delivery
rose 0.14 cent a gallon to 45.34 cents, while most longer-term
months declined. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for May fell 0.22 cent
a gallon to 48.42 cents, but longer-term contracts advanced.
   Crude prices failed to reach the $17-a-barrel level, which they
had tumbled below Tuesday following reports that the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries' pricing committee would not
recommend a full ministerial conference of the cartel at its April
9 meeting.
   The upcoming meeting in Vienna, Austria, earlier had incited
hope that the 13-nation cartel would act aggressively to stabilize
prices and enforce production limits to curb excessive supplies.
   ``The market is no longer expecting great shakes'' from the
April 9 meeting, said Bob Baker, an oil analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   But Baker said prices were supported by the latest weekly
statistics on the nation's oil supply and demand, which showed a
jump in oil imports and a substantial drawdown of oil stocks from
the previous week.
   The data, released late Tuesday by the American Petroleum
Institute, an industry group based in Washington, were construed as
indicating continued robust demand for oil.

<HEAD>Stocks Post Broad Advance, Trigger Trading Limit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices have jumped sharply in response to
optimism over the outlook for inflation and interest rates,
propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to its second biggest
gain of the year.
   The Wednesday rise in the Dow was sharp enough to trigger a New
York Stock Exchange restriction on computerized program trading for
the first time since the limit was announced Feb. 4.
   But stocks kept rising even after the restriction _ effective
once the Dow industrials moves more than 50 points up or down from
the previous day's close _ kicked in late in the session.
   The Dow industrials finished 64.16 points higher at 2,061.67. It
was the average's ninth-biggest gain ever and the largest since it
rose 76.42 on Jan. 4.
   Nearly three issues rose for every one that fell among
NYSE-listed issues. NYSE trading volume grew to 189.76 million
shares from 135.29 million shares on Tuesday.
   Analysts said the market's rise was triggered by a news report
from Japan that officials of the seven major industrial countries
likely would agree on a plan to support the dollar in foreign
exchange.
   A strong dollar would diminish inflationary pressure, which in
turn could ease upward pressure on interest rates, analysts said.
   Recent expectations that the Fed would tighten credit and push
interest rates higher had depressing stock market psychology, said
Newton D. Zinder, a market analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   But some analysts were skeptical about how long the strong gains
would last, given the market's recent volatility.
   The NYSE program trading restrictions took effect after the Dow
industrials passed the 50-point gain mark at about 3:19 p.m. EDT, a
spokeswoman for the exchange said.
   Program trading is a technique used by big investors to profit
on price differences between stocks and the corresponding
stock-index futures. It has been blamed for injecting volatility
into the market, frightening investors away and harming the
securities industry.

<HEAD>NYSE Gears For 1 Billion-Share Day By Late Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crushing trading volume during last year's stock
market crash has prompted the New York Stock Exchange to broaden
the planned expansion of its trading systems, with a daily
capability of 1 billion shares targeted by the end of 1989.
   ``At a time when many firms are cutting costs, we believe the
securities industry needs to take action to insure the ability to
handle high volume,'' NYSE President Robert Birnbaum said Wednesday.
   The exchange now can efficiently process the buying and selling
of 200 million shares a day. It initially planned to broaden its
capacity to 400 million shares a day this year, but increaesd that
target following the October stock market crash.
   Volume exceeded 600 million shares on both Oct. 19 and 20,
representing 200 million shares more than the system's current
theoretical capacity.
   The exchange now expects to be able comfortably to handle daily
volume of 600 million shares by June, according to its operations
advisory committee, which is coordinating the upgrading of the
securities industry's trading and communications systems.
   Last year trading volume averaged 197 million shares a day.
   Among additional measures the NYSE has taken to upgrade its
systems capacity since the October market crash are:
   _Increasing and restructuring the Designated Order Turnaround
(DOT) System's memory for more efficient order processing.
   _Program changes to the limit order systems to reduce
bottlenecks during peak volume periods. A 50 percent capacity
increase is targed for this month.
   _Adding 20 printers to the trading floor, thereby increasing
capacity by 20 percent, and increasing the number of electronic
display books on the floor by 25 percent.
   _Replacing the automated pricing and reporting system.
   Since 1982 the NYSE has spent more than $250 million upgrading
its systems and technology. The exchange has budgeted another $200
million to be spent on improvements over the next five years.

   Growing confidence in the economy and plentiful
buyer incentive offerings boosted domestic car and light truck
sales in late March and the first quarter of 1988, according to
manufacturers and industry analysts.
   Sales of domestically-manufactured cars in the 10 selling days
of March 21-31 totaled 332,721, up from 282,358 in the nine selling
days during the late-March period last year. Domestic sales for the
quarter totaled 1,914,022, up from 1,666,748 a year earlier,
according to manufacturers sales reports released Wednesday.
   Import car sales, reported monthly, totaled 255,867 for March,
up from 237,677 in March 1987, and 700,572 for the quarter, up from
639,403 in first quarter 1987.
   Cynthia Certo, an automotive industry analyst at Integrated
Automotive Resources Inc. in Wayne, Pa., said the sales figures
indicated that buyer incentives offered during the month were very
effective at drawing customers.
   ``Sales are robust for the month, continuing what was going on
in January and February,'' Certo said.
   Buyers appear confident in a strong election-year economy and
unworried about last October's stock slump, she said.
   ``Cash-allowance buyer incentive programs are in effect a
temporary price cut and the buyers are reacting to the bargain
prices,'' said Robert L. Rewey, a Ford Motor Co. vice president.
   Rewey also said: ``The solid economic conditions of high
employment and strong consumer confidence are a major part of their
total purchase process.''
   First-quarter sales of imported light trucks slid to 168,908
from 204,424 in the 1987 first-quarter, while domestic light truck
sales jumped to 1,044,984 for the quarter, compared with 840,073 in
the year-earlier quarter.
   Ford and Chrysler both reported more than 18 percent jumps in
daily sales rates for the quarter. General Motors Corp., the top
seller, reported a 9.5 percent rise in its daily rate.
   GM sold 159,728 domestically produced autos in the March 21-31
period, up from 136,082 in the 1987 late-March period. GM quarterly
sales rose to 942,830 autos from 849,470 in first quarter 1987.
   Ford sold 93,590 domestic cars in the 10 days, up from 79,249,
and 553,545 for the three months, up from 462,629. The automaker
posted an 18.1 percent increase in its daily sales rate for the
quarter over last year.
   Chrysler domestic car sales totaled 48,125 for the 10 days, up
from 41,652, and 283,491 for the quarter, up from 236,280. The
company's daily sales rate jumped 18.4 percent for the quarter.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for March 21-31.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were 10 selling days in the period this year and nine selling
days in the period last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Volkswagen, Honda,
Nissan, Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this
table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sales under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Mexico Will Press Ahead With Efforts to Erase Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico will continue pursuing efforts to pare
its $100 billion foreign debt despite the limited success of its
novel program to swap some loans for U.S.-backed bonds, according
to the nation's chief debt negotiator.
   Jose Angel Gurria, director of public credit for the Treasury
Department, told foreign reporters that the nation's debt outlook
had improved dramatically since the beginning of the crisis in 1982.
   But, he said, ``the matter of the foreign debt continues being a
matter of fundamental importance (and) great worry for Mexican
authorities.''
   ``It's obvious that today we have a situation drastically
different (from 1982), and obviously from a positive point of
view,'' he said.
   ``The situation is much better, it is more comfortable,'' he
said.
   But foreign debt remains a problem because of the hefty amount
of interest Mexico must pay its creditors. Mexico paid $8 billion
to $9 billion in interest on its debt last year, second-highest in
the developing world after Brazil.
   Gurria talked to foreign reporters late Tuesday on the condition
that his remarks not be released as a matter of ``courtesy'' before
he spoke to a panel of the Mexican legislature on Wednesday.
   The Treasury official said Mexican officials were pleased with
the concept of the program to erase some of its foreign debt by
exchanging old loans for special U.S.-backed bonds.
   But he acknowledged February's auction of the bonds had not
lived up to expectations. The operation was ``smaller than what we
had expected, certainly smaller than what we had wanted,'' Gurria
said.
   The program involves exchanging some of the debt Mexico owes
foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year-old bonds issued by the
Mexican government. The bonds are backed by special U.S. Treasury
securities and carry a higher interest rate than Mexico is paying
on the old debt.
   During the Feb. 26 auction, Mexico received bids from 139 banks
in 18 countries but rejected 45 percent of the bids.
   The bids that were accepted will result in retiring $3.66
billion in debt at an average discount of 69.77 cents on the
dollar, offering $2.56 billion worth of bonds in exchange.
   That sale will reduce the Mexican debt by $1.1 billion, a small
amount in comparison with the total oustanding credit. But the
cancellation of debt will mean savings of $1.5 billion in interest
charges over the next 20 years, the government said.
   Gurria said officials were pleased with the discount on the
loans. Mexican debt has been selling for about 50 cents on the
dollar in the secondary market.
   In his remarks to foreign reporters and the legislature, he
emphasized Mexico's desire to erase some of its foreign debt, while
capturing more new money to use in developing the economy.
   ``The balance is difficult to achieve and the final objective
even more so: to reduce the burden of the debt without closing off
to the country doors to possible support that will be required in
the future,'' he said in remarks released by the Treasury
Department.

<HEAD>Sales of Imported Cars in Japan Surge 41.1 Percent In Fiscal 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of imported cars in Japan surged by 41.1
percent in the fiscal year ended in March to a record 104,340
units, partly because of the rising yen and government efforts to
simplify inspection procedures, an industry group announced today.
   Import sales surpassed the previous record of 73,924 units in
fiscal 1986, according to officials of the Japan Automobile
Importers-Association.
   German-made cars topped the list, accounting for 78,468 units of
the total sales, followed by 7,541 British and 4,675
U.S.-manufactured cars.
   The group said that in March, overall import car sales rose 26.1
percent from a year earlier to 11,976 units, also a record. March
marked the 51st consecutive month in which sales rose from the
year-earlier levels, officials said.
   German-made cars accounted for 74 percent of the total import
sales in March, they said.
   The group said the rise in import car sales, both in fiscal 1987
and in March, stemmed from lower interest rates on auto loans and
the yen's sharp appreciation, which makes imported goods cheaper.
   They also said the government simplified inspection procedures
as part of its attempt to bolster imports and cut the nation's
large trade surplus, while foreign car makers stepped up marketing
campaigns in Japan by establishing local subsidiaries.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Following Wednesday's Rally, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in early European trading
today, still boosted by a report that finance ministers of the
seven major industrialized nations will set a floor for the
American currency at a meeting next week.
   Gold prices were lower but steady following Wednesday's falls.
   Dealers said foreign exchange markets had calmed down
considerably following the dollar's frantic rally Wednesday after
the Japanese report that the so-called Group of Seven would set a
bottom rate for the dollar of 125 yen.
   Although traders said they doubted the group has set a specific
minimum for the dollar, the market appeared to be reluctant to sell
dollars before the meeting in Washington next Wednesday.
   ``Until the Group of Seven meeting, it probably won't go any
lower,'' one dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt said.
   While the group may not have specific targets, one trader in
Rome said, ``it is clearly the intention of the central banks,
especially of the United States, to maintain the dollar stable in
order to avoid a negative impact on the stock market.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.67 yen to a closing 125.70 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted fractionally higher at 125.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.6787 West German marks, up from 1.6700; 1.3890
Swiss francs, up from 1.3775; 5.6975 French francs, up from 5.6570;
1.88325 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8720; 1,244.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,236.50; and 1.2445 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2401.
   In London, the dollar also gained against the British pound. It
cost $1.8685 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8790 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $446.60 a troy ounce and
at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $446.25, both down from Wednesday's late bid
of $449.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $446.40, down from $449.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.56 to close at a bid $447.65.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.45 a troy
ounce, down from late Wednesday's $6.57.

<HEAD>Nikkei Index Hits All-Time High, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices surpassed their pre-crash best levels
and reached an all-time high today in Tokyo, while the dollar
gained ground against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 195.82 points Wednesday, gained
another 258.05 points, or 0.97 percent, closing the day at
26,769.22.
   The overnight surge in New York helped release bullish sentiment
pent up for several days because of concern over how Wall Street
would fare if the dollar fell further or U.S. interest rates rose,
traders said.
   The Nikkei average close today was more than 100 points above
the previous high recorded just before the worldwide stock market
crash last Oct. 14, when it closed at 26,646.43.
   ``Share prices rose almost across the board,'' said Yoshio
Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.
   The key market barometers regaining their pre-crash levels
indicated the strong fundamentals of the Tokyo market, he said.
   Prominent among gainers were electricals and automobiles.
Financials were also firm. Volume of the first section trade was a
heavy 1.6 billion shares.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed the day at 125.70, the day's high,
up 0.67 yen from its close of 125.03 yen Wednesday. It had opened
the day at 125.60 yen and ranged between 125.40 and 125.70 yen.
   ``Trading was mixed in dollar-buying and selling, but the market
was generally quiet,'' said an exchange dealer at a major
commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He attributed the quietness to participants sidestepping the
market in advance of the meeting of seven major monetary nations in
Washington next week.

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner, sentenced
for tax fraud to create a $3 million project to aid the homeless,
insists he wants to go ahead with the plan despite the objections
of a federal prosecutor.
   Posner, 69, faced what could have been up to a 40-year prison
term after pleading no contest to inflating that value of land
donated to a college in order to deduct it from his tax return.
   Instead, the Miami Beach financier was ordered to set up the $3
million project to aid the homeless and pay $4 million in back
taxes, interest, fines and court costs.
   While the $4 million part of Posner's sentence won't be changed,
U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, who did not prosecute Posner, has
argued the sentence gives the appearance that the wealthy can buy
their liberty.
   Kellner said in his motion he was ``duty-bound to call to this
court's attention the fact that this court does not have the power
to order a criminal defendant to make charitable contributions as a
condition of probation.''
   At a hearing Wednesday, Judge Eugene P. Spellman required the
69-year-old Posner to state under oath that he did not wish the
sentence set aside and that he was going ahead with the plan
``freely and voluntarily.''
   Posner and a 10-member blue ribbon committee met Wednesday in
Spellman's courtroom to discuss the first stage of the program, a
study of the homeless in south Florida.
   ``Since February, I have been studying and learning about the
problems of the homeless both nationally and in Florida,'' Posner
said in a brief statement. ``All the studies in the world will not
help one homeless person. I will come to you with what will solve
the problem.''
   Posner's attorney, Edward Bennett Williams, must formally reply
within 30 days to Kellner's motion, which was filed Monday,
Spellman said.
   The initial study will include a six-part census of south
Florida's homeless; an examination of subpopulations such as
alcoholics, the mentally ill and families with children; and a
review of how government policy affected the problem and what
services are available to the homeless in each community.
   Spellman said he didn't plan to take an active role in the
committee's deliberations but suggested that the initial study not
use more than $500,000 of Posner's donation.
   Findings are scheduled to be available by May 16, said David
Fike of Barry University, which was chosen by Posner to administer
the study because of its social work program.
   Sister Jeanne O'Loughlin, president of Barry University, praised
the tycoon's ideas and said she hoped that Posner's donation would
be the nucleus of a program that might grow to $300 million.
   ``He has a very fast mind,'' she said. ``He's creating solutions
even before we give him all the data.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices jumped on the London stock exchange
Thursday, boosted by the previous strong gains on the New York and
Tokyo markets.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 22.2
points, or 1.3 percent, at 1,767.0 at midday.
   Volume was 261.9 million shares, compared with 220.9 million
shares at the same point Wednesday.
   Share prices were marked up as soon as trading started in
reaction to the strong rises in New York and Tokyo.
   All three markets were helped by an unconfirmed Japanese report
that the Group of Seven industrialized nations' finance ministers
would seek to maintain a floor for the dollar at around 125 yen at
a meeting to be held in Washington on Wednesday.
   However, banking shares were sharply lower after Barclays PLC, a
major British bank, announced it would raise 921 million pounds, or
$1.72 billion, by offering its shareholders the opportunity to buy
one new Barclays share at a substantial discount for every two they
already own.
   But news of the issue had little effect on the market overall,
which remained focused on the Wall Street and Tokyo gain.
   Dealers said rumors of a large issue were circulating late on
Wednesday, reducing the impact of Barclays' announcement.

   The Chicago Board of Trade says it intends to
cooperate with the Tokyo Stock Exchange in trading futures
contracts on Japanese and U.S. government bonds and a Japanese
stock index.
   CBOT officials say they met in Japan with executives of the
Tokyo exchange to discuss the ventures, which will be launched
later this year.
   A spokesman for the Board of Trade said Wednesday the link
between the two exchanges will be the first cooperative effort
between a U.S. and Japanese exchange.
   ``The Asia-Pacific region is extremely important to the entire
futures industry,'' said Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann,
adding that the exchange plans to open an office in Tokyo later
this year.
   Fred Grede, a CBOT vice president, said the two exchanges aren't
discussing a trading link that would permit contracts to be bought
at one exchange and sold at another.
   Instead the two exchanges will work together in developing the
contracts to make them more appealing to U.S. and overseas traders.
   The Tokyo exchange will license use of its ``Topix'' composite
index to the CBOT. Topix futures have yet to receive Japanese
regulatory approval, but the CBOT could begin trading the index
contract as soon as it is launched in Japan.

<HEAD>Taiwan's March Trade Surplus Lowest Since January 1983</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan registered a trade surplus of $163
million in March, the lowest monthly surplus in six years, the
government reported Thursday.
   Taiwan's surplus with the United States, the island's largest
trading partner, totaled $298 million in March, down sharply from
$1.27 billion a year earlier, the government said.
   The monthly surplus was down sharply from $994 million in
February, according to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.
   Exports totaled $4.51 billion, up 10.9 percent from March last
year, while imports amounted to $4.35 billion, up 67.6 percent, the
report said.
   Taiwan's monthly surplus has not been that low since April 1982,
when it was $60 million.
   The United States in January replaced Japan as the country
sending the most goods to Taiwan, with U.S. imports reaching $1.3
billion in March, up 152 percent from a year earlier. Taiwan's
exports to the United States equaled $1.6 billion, down 10.5
percent, the report said.
   Trade officials attributed the surplus decline to tariff
reductions on 3,500 items and the 39 percent appreciation of the
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar since January 1986, which has
made American products less expensive here.
   Taiwan has been under U.S. pressure to reduce its massive
bilateral trade surplus, which totaled a record $16 billion last
year, the third largest surplus with the United States after those
of Japan and Canada.
   Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan, its second largest trading
partner, totaled $601 million in March, up 27 percent from the same
month last year.

<HEAD>Mercantile Exchange Votes To Implement An S&P Opening Limit of
Five Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Board of Governors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange voted Wednesday to implement an opening limit of five
points in the S&P 500 futures contract, officials said.
   The opening limit was approved by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission last week and will be effective April 19.
   It isdesigned to coordinate any imbalance which may occur at the
opening of the New York Stock Exchange.
   The opening limit was one of a series of proposals the exchange
made to the CFTC in early February designed to address concerns
raised by the Brady Commission that investigated the stock market
crash.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the first exchange to
implement daily price limits on its stock index contract.
   Traders and market users will be briefed on the opening limit
before its implementation.
   The new rule specifies that there will be no trading at a price
more than five index points above or below the previous day's
settlement price.
   If triggered on the opening, the five-point limit will remain in
effect for the first 10 minutes of scheduled trading or until the
contract trades off the five-point limit, whichever happens first.
   After 10 minutes or if the contract trades off the limit, the
regular daily limit of 15 index points becomes effective.

   Robert Morosky, a key player in Campeau
Corp.'s victory in the takeover fight for Federated Department
Stores Inc., is meeting with Federated executives but won't say how
many will be retained.
   Morosky told a news conference Wednesday his first priority is
to refocus the attention of Federated employees, who have been
involved in the 2-month-long takeover war, on retailing.
   ``I'll be concentrating on getting people back to business, back
to selling merchandise,'' he said.
   Morosky declined to say whether Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau
will allow Federated's two top executives to keep their jobs. He
said Federated Chairman Howard Goldfeder and President Norman
Matthews face a decision.
   ``I'm looking forward to sitting down with both of them,''
Morosky told reporters during his tour of Federated's Cincinnati
headquarters tower.
   He began meeting with Federated executives, saying he hopes many
of them will choose to stay with the company, which operates more
than 650 stores nationwide and had $11.1 billion in sales last year.
   Morosky has said the Toronto-based Campeau will streamline
Federated, combining purchasing, marketing and other operations now
done independently by Federated's store groups.
   Some Allied executives will be relocated to Cincinnati, but
others will remain in New York, Morosky has said.
   Morosky, 46, a retailer of 17 years' experience, is president of
Allied Stores Corp., the retailer purchased by Campeau in December
1986.
   Campeau sold off many Allied divisions to pay off its debt in
that purchase and analysts have said they expect Campeau will do
the same with Federated.
   Morosky repeated Campeau's intention to keep Federated's ``crown
jewel'' store groups: Burdine's, based in Miami; Bloomingdale's and
Abraham & Straus based in New York; Lazarus in the Midwest; Rich's
in Georgia and Goldsmith's in Tennessee. He said Campeau also plans
to keep Ralphs, a Los Angeles-based supermarket chain.
   R.H. Macy & Co. Inc., the New York retailer Campeau beat out in
the fight for Federated, completed an agreement with Campeau last
week under which Macy will buy the Los Angeles-based Bullock's
stores and the San Francisco-based I. Magnin store group.
   Campeau has said it agreed to sell the Houston-based Foley's
store group and the Boston-based Filene's store chain to May
Department Stores Co.
   Also on the block are the Columbus-based Gold Circle discount
store chain and Federated's specialty stores.

<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers members moved closer
to wrapping up demands for mid-April Chrysler Corp. contract talks,
but continued wrangling internally over whether to extend the
contract's protections to some former American Motors Corp. workers.
   About 140 delegates from 49 Chrysler local unions approved
contract proposals Wednesday that closely mirror economic and
job-protecting provisions in contracts signed last fall with
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   The union's main strategy in talks set to open April 18 is to
return to uniform bargaining with the Big Three U.S. automakers by
imposing the Ford-GM pattern contract on Chrysler and by limiting
the contract to two years so that all three contracts expire
together in 1990.
   ``We've had a pattern settlement before us now for almost a
year. ... It should not take a long time for us to put this
together,'' UAW President Owen Bieber said of the coming
negotiations after addressing the delegates.
   The strategy prevents the union from seeking to win Chrysler's
59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers any significant
improvement on the GM-Ford pattern in this year's talks. But it
will strengthen the UAW's bargaining power in 1990, when its
members' jobs will be further threatened by as many as eight
Japanese-owned U.S. factories capable of building up to 2.5 million
vehicles a year.
   The decision against asking for pay raises breaking the GM and
Ford pattern angered some Chrysler bargainers.
   ``We're stuck with something that was negotiated with GM and
Ford,'' Gregg Betts, unit chairman of Local 573 of the Office and
Clerical Workers, told The Detroit News. ``We're not getting any
raises, and the membership doesn't want it.''
   Like the GM and Ford contracts, the UAW's Chrysler proposals
would give workers yearly bonuses equal to 3 percent of their
annual wages, forbid plant closings and prevent layoffs for any
reason except a drop in sales.
   But unlike the two earlier pacts, the Chrysler proposal also
would forbid sale of plants or operations during the life of the
contract, an attempt to force Chrysler to back further away from
plans to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   The council was scheduled to finish approving demands today and
to vote on whether to include nearly 1,000 former AMC workers at an
engine and stamping plant in Kenosha, Wis., under the Chrysler
contract or to leave them to bargain for themselves, as they did
before Chrysler bought AMC last August.

   Koppers Co. has won a second federal court
injunction blocking hostile suitors led by British industrialist
Brian C. Beazer and the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``The scale comes down on the side of Koppers,'' U.S. District
Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr. wrote in issuing a preliminary
injunction Wednesday preventing the Beazer group from proceeding
with its $1.7 billion tender offer before April 15.
   The Beazer group said today it would extend its $60-a-share
offer, launched March 3, from its scheduled expiration at midnight
today until midnight April 15.
   A federal judge in Los Angeles issued an injunction Monday
blocking the hostile $60-a-share offer indefinitely on antitrust
grounds. Cohill said if Beazer succeeded in overturning the
California ruling, his order immediately blocks the offer until
April 15, when he intends to rule on Koppers' claims that the
tender offer violates securities law.
   Koppers stock fell 87{ cents to $55.37{ a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   A federal judge in Delaware last Friday rejected the Beazer
group's request to invalidate Koppers' ``poison pill'' takeover
defense, which greatly would increase the cost of a hostile
takeover.
   It was not immediately clear how the hurdle raised by Cohill
will affect the tender offer from BNS Inc., the takeover company
formed by Beazer, Shearson and National Westminster Bank PLC.
   BNS attorney Edwin Mishkin told Cohill the investors were
prepared to extend the tender offer _ scheduled to expire at
midnight tonight _ until his ruling. BNS had contended that delays
in closing the deal could jeopardize its financing.
   Meanwhile, Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin testified before
Cohill Wednesday that he expects the Koppers board eventually to
reject as inadequate the $60 offer as it did Beazer's earlier bids
of $45 and $56 per share.
   Koppers board stated Tuesday it would take no position on the
latest offer immediately due to the pending litigation and the
company's ongoing attempts to seek alternatives to the hostile
buyout.
   The 64-year-old Koppers chairman said he expected someone to
beat the $60-a-share offer, but ``I'm not sure I could hazard a
guess as to when.''
   Pullin testified that the board was considering selling an
interest in all or part of the company, which has operations in
construction materials and services and chemicals. Management
prefers to sell no more than 20 percent to 25 percent of its valued
construction materials and services group, he said.
   Koppers has said it also was considering a recapitalization
plan, or the sale of the entire company.
   ``Some management people have talked about a leveraged buyout,''
of the chemicals businesses _ which Beazer has indicated he would
sell if successful in his takeover of Koppers _ although pollution
cleanup obligations make that option less likely, Pullin said.

   Stock prices churned in a narrow range today,
bogging down after Wednesday's strong rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 64.16 points on
Wednesday, dropped back 2.49 to 2,059.18 by 11 a.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 697 up, 531 down and
524 unchanged.
   Analysts said new signs of stability in the dollar had touched
off rallies in stock markets around the world.
   The Tokyo market climbed today to new highs, having recovered
all the ground it lost in last year's crash.
   But the U.S. bond market showed less life. Prices of long-term
government bonds declined slightly this morning, putting their
yields in the 8.75-8.8 percent range.
   And brokers said many traders were reluctant to chase after
stocks while talk persists that the Federal Reserve might be
leaning toward a tighter credit policy, and that leading banks
might soon raise their prime lending rates.
   Among Japanese issues traded in the U.S. markets, Honda Motor
gained 3| to 141| and Matsushita Electrical rose 4[ to 224[.
   Irving Bank jumped 4] to 68{ on speculation that the company,
which is fighting a takeover bid by Bank of New York, might be
close to reaching a deal with another party.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.13 to 149.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .04 at 297.54.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. officially ended a year under
bankruptcy court protection today, completing its epic legal fight
with Pennzoil Co. but facing continued pressure from dissident
shareholders and takeover strategists.
   Under a reorganization plan approved March 23 by a federal
bankruptcy court judge, the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant
transferred $3 billion to a Houston bank account in Pennzoil's name
today. Texaco also will begin making another $2.6 billion in
payments to its other creditors.
   The four wire transfers to Texas Commerce Bank began at 10:03
a.m. CST today and took 10 minutes to complete, officials at the
Texas Commerce Bank said.
   In exchange for the $3 billion, Pennzoil will drop its claim to
a $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco that Houston-based Pennzoil
was holding when Texaco filed for Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors on last April 12.
   Texaco said it took that action to avoid having to post a
potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond while
appealing the judgment awarded Pennzoil by a Houston jury in
November 1985.
   The jury found Texaco had improperly interfered with a January
1984 Pennzoil acquisition of part of Getty Oil Co., then bought all
of Getty itself.
   Following U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Schwartzberg's
approval of the plan _ worked out in December by the two companies
and committees representing Texaco creditors and shareholders _
Pennzoil borrowed $2.7 billion from a consortium of banks.
   The loan was to be repaid today once the $3 billion is deposited
in Pennzoil's account at Texas Commerce Bank in Houston, Pennzoil
spokesman Mike White said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   Bob Harper, another Pennzoil spokesman, said today that no
company celebration was planned to mark the occasion, but he added
he was glad to see the case finally end.
   ``It's obviously been a very protracted affair,'' Harper said.
``I think it is important that all the parties concerned move into
the mainstream of what we really do best, and that's run our
companies.''
   The money Pennzoil borrowed has been invested in short-term
securities such as government securities and high-grade corporate
bonds, Harper said. Pennzoil borrowed the money before actually
getting the cash so the company could invest it ``in an orderly
manner.''
   Harper said he does not expect any immediate major investments
by Pennzoil.
   ``Our board really wants to take a look at all the options out
there,'' he said. ``We've been looking at various opportunities.
Our board will meet in early June to assess various possibilities.''
   Officials of both companies have said they chose to settle the
matter so they could get back to their businesses without the
prospect of endless litigation.
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, who holds 14.8 percent of
Texaco's stock and is its largest shareholder, last week filed an
appeal of the reorganization plan objecting to certain financial
conditions and provisions giving legal releases to Texaco officials.
   But Icahn stressed he never opposed the plan as a whole.
   ``I'm glad they came out of bankruptcy, and did not want to
stand in the way of that event,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
   Icahn added that he thought it was ``wrong that shareholders
were forced to give releases to those involved (in the Getty Oil
acquisition) without having to vote on the releases separately.''
   His objection _ joined by other shareholders _ has been that
Texaco was throwing away a chance to recoup some of its losses by
suing the people who were responsible.
   Icahn also opposed a default provision of a loan Texaco will use
to help fund the reorganization.
   Under a provision of Texaco's agreement with a consortium of
about 25 banks providing up to $3 billion in credit, the loans
would be callable, on a vote by two-thirds of the banks, if control
of the company changed hands.
   Attorneys representing Icahn and some shareholders criticized
the indemnity and change-of-control provisions as devices for
entrenching Texaco's management.
   But Schwartzberg, in approving the plan, cited contentions by
Texaco and Pennzoil that the indemnities were necessary to end the
litigation.
   He also cited testimony that the banks insisted on the
change-of-control provision as a requirement for granting Texaco
the $3 billion loan.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has imposed
fishing sanctions against Japan in reprisal for alleged violations
of an international whale conservation accord.
   In a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Reagan said
the Commerce Department found that Japan has been granting permits
allowing the killing of its minke whales in the Antarctic for
research purposes.
   In Tokyo, an official from the Japanese Fisheries Agency said
his government would seek to lift the sanctions through discussions
with U.S. authorities.
   He said that the issue of fishing rights in U.S. waters had
nothing to do with the whaling accord.
   ``The feeling is that we've been hit through some irrelevant
issue,'' he said.
   Invoking the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
and the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, Reagan ordered the
State Department to withhold 100 percent of the fishing privileges
that would otherwise be available to Japan in an exclusive U.S.
fishing zone.
   Ken Cook, a spokesman for the U.S. affiliate of the World
Wildlife Fund, said Wednesday the announced fishing sanctions would
hurt the Japanese to a degree. But he said the punitive measures
come too late to save any of the 300 minke whales that Japan plans
to take in this year's research program.
   In his letter to Wright, Reagan said that Japan had been
granting the whale-killing permits despite a 1987 International
Whaling Commission resolution against this practice.
   That resolution recommended that Japan refrain from issuing
further permits ``until uncertainties in their scientific research
proposals were resolved.''
   The president's letter said the commission adopted a second
resolution since the finding of non-compliance by Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity, in which the panel again recommended
that Japan discontinue the practice.
   Reagan said he had no evidence that Japan ``is bringing its
whaling activities into conformance'' with the whaling commission
recommendations.
   He said that because of this, the U.S. government would deny
Japan's request to fish for 3,000 metric tons of sea snails and
5,000 metric tons of Pacific whiting.
   Reagan also told Wright that Japan will be ``barred from any
future allocations of fishing privileges for any other species,
including Pacific cod, until the secretary of commerce determines
that the situation has been corrected.'' He called the sanctions
``the strongest possible'' under existing law.
   Reagan, however, stopped short of moving against Japanese fish
products imported into the United States, saying the steps he took
represented the ``most effective means of encouraging Japan to
embrace the IWC conservation program.''

<HEAD>Group Plans to Breed Alligators in Spain for Meat and Skin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Danish investment group plans to
set up Europe's first alligator farm in southern Spain to produce
skins and meat for export, the project's organizer said Thursday.
   ``The baby alligators would come from the United States and be
bred at the farm in Spain, but it would take three to four years
before production and export of the reptiles' skin and meat could
begin,'' said Leif Skovgaard in a telephone interview with the
Associated Press.
   Skovgaard, a chartered accountant who is organizing the project
for a group of seven Danish investors, said 10,000 to 12,000
alligators would be bred yearly at a farm near the town of San
Roque.
   European Alligator Institue, as the project is called, is
seeking financial support from local and state governments in Spain
as well as the European Economic Community.
   The farm, which the group hopes to open by the beginning of
1989, would employ about 100 people, Skovgaard said.
   ``As alligators are dangerous at any age, our personnel will be
specially trained to cope with them so they don't lose fingers,''
he added.
   The investors hope to develop a nature park where visitors can
observe the animals, which can grow to 15 feet in length, in an
outdoor environment.
   Alligator meat, according to Skovgaard, tastes like something
between veal and chicken, and is popular in American, British and
French fish restaurants.
   The skins are used for shoes, handbags and other leather
assessories.
   Skovgaard said he did not anticipate protests from animal
protection or environmental groups.
   The United States banned hunting alligators because the species
was disappearing. but the ban was lifted recently after the
alligators made a strong comeback.

   Barclays PLC, a major British bank, said Thursday
that it would raise 921 million pounds, or about $1.72 billion at
current exchange rates, by offering its stockholders the
opportunity to buy new shares.
   A spokeswoman in New York, meanwhile, denied rumors that the
bank was raising money to persue a friendly acquisition of Irving
Bank Corp., a New York bank holding company resisting a hostile
takeover from rival Bank of New York Co.
   ``No talks are going on and we have no interest,'' said Marion
J. Cotrone, a vice president at Barclays.
   Barclays said the stock issue _ its largest ever _ will be used
to expand domestic and international business, ``with particular
emphasis on the major economies of Europe, the (United States) and
the Far East.''
   Under the one-for-two rights issue, Barclays shareholders will
be able to buy one new Barclays share at a substantial discount for
every two they already own.
   The bank said it will issue 369.5 million new shares at a price
of 250 pence, or about $4.68, each. Expenses will be deducted from
the total raised.
   News of the issue sent Barclays shares tumbling on the London
Stock Exchange. The shares were down 48 pence each at 434 pence.
   Share prices were depressed Wednesday by rumors that a major
rights issue would be launched, but Barclays' announcement, while
knocking down bank shares, hardly had any impact on the wider
market.

<HEAD>Former Reuters, Times of London Chairman Dead at 69</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Denis Hamilton, a former chairman of the
Reuters news agency and a leading figure in the British newspaper
industry, died Thursday at the age of 69.
   Hamilton, onetime editor-in-chief of Times Newspapers Ltd.,
which includes the Times of London, died at his home in London
after a long illness. The cause of death was not given.
   He introduced the color magazine supplement, now a feature of
all the big national weekly newpapers, into British journalism.
   Hamilton, also a onetime chairman of the British Museum and
recipient of a knighthood in 1976, began his career as a cub
reporter on the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette in northern England
in 1936.
   An influential figure in British newspapers for more than four
decades, Hamilton was also the first president from 1978 until 1983
of the International Press Institute, an organization of more than
200 editors and publishers.
   Hamilton was chairman of Reuters from 1979 to 1985 during the
British-based agency's expansion of its financial news services.
   After a meteoric career in newspapers in northern England and a
distinguished military record during World War II, Hamilton at 28
became personal assistant to newspaper proprietor Lord Kemsley.
   Hamilton became editor of the London Sunday Times, weekly
companion of the Times of London, when Canadian Lord Thomson bought
the newspapers in 1959, as well as editorial director of the group.
   As chief executive of Times Newspapers Ltd., Hamilton battled
production unions over computer technology and staff cutbacks. It
culminated in a year-long strike which closed the newspapers in
1978. In 1981, they were bought by publisher Rupert Murdoch.
   He is survived by his wife, Olive, and four sons.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of American families of
Asian and the Pacific Islands background have more than two people
holding jobs, well above the national average, the Census Bureau
reports.
   Leading are Americans of Tongan descent, with 71.6 percent of
families reporting multiple workers.
   But Filipinos were close behind with 71.4 percent, the Bureau
reported in releasing final Asian and Pacific Islander statistics
from the 1980 census.
   Overall, 63.3 percent of Asian families and 57.6 percent of
those from the Pacific islands had multiple workers.
   By comparison, 54.2 percent of all families in the United States
have multiple workers.
   While Tongans had the most workers, their median family income
of $16,717 lagged behind the national average of $19,917 at the
time of the count.
   Filipinos, on the other hand, reported median family income of
$23,687, third among Asian and Pacific ethnic groups.
   Tops in family income were the Japanese at $27,354, followed by
Indians with $24,993.
   Koreans were most likely to be self-employed at 11.9 percent,
well ahead of the 7.9 percent for Japanese. For the nation as a
whole, 6.8 percent of people are self-employed.
   Cambodians were most likely to be foreign born, at 93.9 percent,
followed by 93.7 percent of Laotians in this country. Only 6.2
percent of the overall population is foreign born.
   In terms of education, Pakistanis led with 58.4 percent being
college graduates. Overall, 32.9 percent of Asians and Pacific
Islanders in this country have college degrees, about double the
16.2 percent for the nation as a whole.
   The study covers all U.S. residents reporting their descent from
Asia or the islands of the Pacific Ocean, regardless of how long
they had been in this country.
   Here is a rundown of some of the data in the report:
   _Asian Indians: 58.2 percent with multiple workers; $24,993
income; 5.7 percent self-employed; 70.4 percent foreign born; 51.9
percent college graduates; 3.5 persons per family.
   _Cambodian: 42.4 percent multiple workers; $8,712 income; 2.0
percent self-employed; 93.9 percent foreign born; 7.7 percent
college graduates; 4.6 persons per family.
   _Chinese: 65.5 percent multiple workers; $22,559 income; 7.2
percent self-employed; 63.3 percent foreign born; 36.6 percent
college graduates; 3.7 persons per family.
   _Filipino: 71.4 percent multiple workers; $23,687 income; 2.7
percent self-employed; 64.7 percent foreign born; 37.0 percent

<HEAD>Unions Battle Back Against Lorenzo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buoyed by favorable court decisions and growing
political support, Eastern Airlines' labor leaders say they believe
they've got the momentum in the battle to save the financially
troubled carrier.
   ``There's a new sense that the right people are finally
listening to what we're saying,'' said Ron Cole, spokesman for the
Air Line Pilots Association at Eastern, a subsidiary of mammoth
Texas Air Corp.
   ``It's very heartening to a lot of employees,'' Cole said. ``Up
until not long ago, everyone thought (Texas Air chairman) Frank
Lorenzo was unbeatable.''
   ``I have felt a lot of confidence all along that we were gaining
momentum, that we were going to get justice,'' added Charles Bryan,
veteran leader of the Eastern Machinists union, which represents
12,000 maintenance and ground workers in a company with 33,000
employees.
   ``Lorenzo was just arrogant ... thumbing his nose at justice.
We've been able to hold the resistance movement together very
effectively.''
   Speaking in his union office less than five miles from the Miami
offices of the Contra rebels _ the Nicaraguan resistance _ Bryan
smiled as he realized his description of the unions as ``the
resistance movement.''
   ``We're an occupied country right now,'' said Bryan, 54, a
32-year veteran of Eastern. ``It's our airline, we built it up. But
we've been invaded.''
   Eastern management officials declined to be interviewed about
the recent developments.
   Spokesman Robin Matell said the situation was too uncertain to
speculate. But he said the unions have exaggerated the significance
of court rulings and added that management still considers reducing
labor costs crucial to salvaging the carrier, which has lost $900
million in the past 10 years.
   ``It still comes down to this: `Do you pay baggage handlers
$47,000 a year?''' Matell said.
   U.S. District Judge John Pratt in Washington declared March 10
that Eastern was in contempt of court for trying to sell its
profitable Northeast shuttle to another unit of Texas Air. Earlier
this week, Pratt said he has accepted a report from Eastern
officials that the airline no longer planned to sell off the
shuttle and would not find them in contempt if they follow through
with that pledge.
   On March 28, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker, also in
Washington, granted a preliminary injunction sought by Eastern
pilots which would prevent Eastern from using its planes to train
pilots from Orion Air.
   Eastern management hoped to use the North Carolina cargo line to
fly Eastern routes in case of a strike.
   The rulings were crucial to halting what the unions believe are
two major pushes by Lorenzo, who began taking over Eastern two
years ago following his successful takeover of Continental Airlines
and has since swallowed up New York Air, People Express and other
small carriers.
   Stymied by Continental unions in 1983, Lorenzo shut the airline
down, took it into federal bankruptcy reorganization, got union
contracts voided, and emerged with a low-cost carrier.
   The Pratt injunction halted the ``spin-off'' of the shuttle,
which the labor leaders see as part of a strategy by Lorenzo to
cannibalize Eastern's assets. The Eastern reservations system was
bought by Texas Air last year, and planes and gates have also been
sold off.
   The Parker injunction against training Orion pilots sets back
Eastern's strike contingency program. Bryan warned machinists last
December, when labor talks deadlocked, to be ready for a
management-provoked strike that he said was aimed at crushing the
union.
   But the federal mediator sent in for the talks has so far
declined to classify the talks ``at an impasse.'' If he makes that
declaration, a 30-day cooling off period must follow.
   The unions, in a national election year, have rallied political
support.
   Democratic presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and Richard
Gephardt criticized Eastern management during February campaign
appearances here. Congressional hearings have been held into
Eastern safety practices and some congressmen are calling for a
federal probe into the Texas Air takeover.
   A report by the House Committee on Government Operations said
Orion Air should correct ``deeply rooted and pervasive problems''
before gaining Federal Aviation Administration permission to fly
Eastern planes.
   Other unions have joined Eastern employees in ``Jobs for
Justice'' rallies on the Capitol steps and other locations.
   ``The attitude in other unions is if Frank Lorenzo's model for
destroying unions is successful, it may well spill over. It
threatens most unions,'' Bryan said.
   The unions have numerous court cases, including lawsuits from
fired employees and hundreds of pending grievances. The Machinists
filed a new federal suit March 31 in Washington charging Eastern,
Texas Air and other defendants with systematically violating
federal securities and labor laws.
   More than a year ago, Eastern management called for a 30 percent
reduction, or $490 million, in labor costs. Union leaders responded
that Eastern employees have made concessions for years and are
tired of paying for bad management.
   The employees say they want to buy Eastern and run the airline
themselves.
   ``Eastern has everything it needs to be a success: an
established name; dedicated professional employees, good routes,
major airports. We could make it the airline it should be,'' said
Nancy Currier, a vice president of the Eastern flight attendants
local.
   Takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens last month expressed
interest in helping the unions realize their dream of taking the
airline from Lorenzo. Independent analysts have said such a
takeover seems unlikely but could intensify pressure on Lorezno,
whose Texas Air empire is $5 billion in debt.

   Alex S. Tillman feels left out when he reads
about the National Alliance, the white supremacist group that wants
to abolish affirmative action at American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   Tillman, a 42-year-old black executive at Bell Laboratories, is
wondering why no one has paid attention to his own proposal _ for
AT&T to increase its affirmative action.
   While the National Alliance occupies No. 5 on the AT&T
shareholders' ballot, Tillman is an uneasy neighbor at No. 4.
   ``I don't have any ax to grind with AT&T. I'm very pleased with
my employment here. ... But our name carries America in it. If
anybody should be setting the example, it should be AT&T,'' Tillman
said Thursday.
   Tillman said he is worried the National Alliance's resolution
might get a significant number of shareholders' votes at the annual
meeting April 20 in Denver.
   AT&T managers might allow a big vote for the National Alliance
proposal to justify weakening their commitment to hiring and
promoting minorities and women, Tillman fears.
   ``I'm not speaking out against white males. I'm saying in God's
land, there's space for everybody,'' Tillman said.
   Tillman, who joined Bell Labs in 1971, handles accounting and
budget preparation for a Bell Labs unit in Murray Hill, N.J. He has
recruited minorities for the company and visits colleges under the
Urban League's Black Executive Exchange Program.
   Tillman is casting his argument in terms that he thinks
shareholders will appreciate: Shifting trends in population mean
that more of the new entrants to the work force through the year
2000 will be minorities and women _ as much as 90 percent of all
new entrants, Fortune magazine said in its April 11 issue.
   ``We're in an economic race, with worldwide competition. To have
people with potential and not use that potential to the fullest is
something America cannot afford,'' he said.
   AT&T promoted only one black to the level of vice president from
1979 to the end of 1987, namely Naseby ``Pete'' Rhinehart Jr., a
corporate vice president for tax planning and compliance, Tillman
said.
   AT&T says 3.9 percent of its senior managers were women and 1.6
percent were minorities as of the end of 1987. In contrast, 46.2
percent of all company employees are women and 20.8 percent are
minorities.
   AT&T spokeswoman LuAnn Gardner said the company's started an
affirmative action advisory board last year and has increased its
hiring of women and minorities. It added a second black vice
president earlier this year.
   ``There have been some improvements under the Jim Olson
administration, but not enough,'' Tillman said, referring to
Chairman James Olson. ``Today it is sound business to ensure that
minorities and women are fully utilized in upper levels.''

   Taking aim on the 21st century and
``multibillion-dollar global'' growth, Apple Computer Inc. Thursday
unveiled plans to slice the company's world marketing pie into
three pieces.
   Marketing will be divided into units to be called Apple USA,
Apple Europe and Apple Pacific, with the U.S. segment subdivided
into six groups reporting to Aple senior Vice President Charles M.
Boesenberg.
   ``We must continue to build an organization ... adaptable enough
to keep pace with our anticipated growth in the coming years,''
said Apple's chief operating officer, Delbert W. Yocam.
   Each of the units in the United States will tailor marketing
solutions to specific geographic and customer needs, aimed at
moving the company closer to its sources of revenue. Apple plans an
``End-User Services'' group to handle customer needs.
   Yocam said the company would appoint a vice president for the
education market in recognition of its importance to the company.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors led by Britain's Brian C. Beazer
Thursday extended their $1.7-billion hostile bid for Koppers Co.
until April 15, when a federal court ruling is due on whether the
offer violates securities laws.
   Beazer said he was shocked that Koppers board of directors has
not yet given shareholders any advice on the $60-a-share offer,
which has been on the table for two weeks.
   The board declared as inadequate Beazer's previous offers of
$45-a-share and $56-a-share.
   Analysts said the Pittsburgh-based cement and building products
company has strengthened its position by shifting the battle from
the stock market to the courtroom.
   ``It looks like Koppers has won a lot of the early skirmishes,''
said an analyst at a Wall Street investment house who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Arbitrageurs who speculate on stock prices during takeover
struggles are ``getting nervous,'' he said, noting that Koppers'
``stock has not been performing well.''
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Koppers rose 75
cents to $56.125 a share.
   As of Tuesday, 137,154 common shares out of Koppers' 28.5
million outstanding shares had been tendered under Beazer's offer,
the suitors said Thursday.
   Beazer complained in a statement that the board is denying
shareholders ``the benefits of an offer that neither it nor its
financial advisers could conclude was inadequate.''
   Observers say that the offer makes a fair valuation of the
company. ``I think it's a very generous offer,'' said the Wall
Street analyst. ``I think management should accept it.''
   U.S. District Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr. on Wednesday barred
the Beazer group from proceeding with its offer until April 15,
when he plans to rule on Koppers' defensive lawsuit filed in
Pittsburgh.
   Cohill said his preliminary injunction will not take effect
unless Beazer succeeds in overturning a similar injunction issued
Monday by a federal judge in Los Angeles on antitrust grounds.
   Separately, BNS Inc., the takeover company formed by Beazer,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank PLC,
failed to persuade a federal judge in Delaware to revoke Koppers'
poison pill, a shareholder rights plan that would greatly increase
the cost of a takeover.
   Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin testified before Cohill
Wednesday that he expects the Koppers board eventually will reject
the $60-a-share offer and that the bid will be topped by some other
bidder. But Pullin added: ``I'm not sure I could hazard a guess as
to when.''
   Koppers has said it is considering selling all or parts of the
company, borrowing heavily to recapitalize the company, or paying
special dividends to enhance shareholder values in order to keep
Koppers away from Beazer.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Hong Kong's cut-throat business world, the
highest acknowledgment of success is to be recognized as the
``taipan'' _ the Big Boss Himself.
   Later this year, a transplanted New Yorker, 38-year-old Brian M.
Powers, will assume the title _ the first American to do so _ only
two years after arriving in Hong Kong as an executive with Jardine
Matheson, the venerable trading company whose history is
intertwined with that of this British colony.
   When the Massapequa, N.Y. native becomes the company's senior
representative in Hong Kong later this year he will inherit the
prestigious title, which means big boss in the Cantonese Chinese
dialect and traditionally is reserved for the local head of Jardine
Matheson.
   The company was founded in nearby Canton in 1832 by Scottish
surgeon's mate William Jardine and Highlander James Matheson. It
moved to Hong Kong in 1841 when the colony was established.
   Jardine Matheson's origins were in the opium and tea trade with
the decaying Qing dynasty and the title taipan still brings to mind
the early merchant ships plying the South China Sea. The company
has since evolved into a diversified international conglomerate
that includes hotels, shipping management, vast lnd holdings and
pizza parlor franchises.
   Throughout the company's rich history it has been led by
Scotsmen, most recently by Simon Keswick. But when Keswick
announced in March that he would step down as taipan, Powers was
named as his replacement.
   ``The fact that I was American was either neutral or to a
negative ... probably more neutral,'' Powers said in a recent
telephone interview about becoming taipan. He added that he first
learned of the title ``when everyone else did, with James Clavell's
book.''
   Clavell authored ``Taipan'' and ``Noble House,'' two fictional
accounts of Hong Kong's business elite that romanticized the
position of taipan.
   After studying economics at Yale and earning a law degree at the
University of Virginia, Powers joined the New York law firm of
Debevoise, Plimpton Lyons & Gates in 1975, handling corporation
mergers and acquisitions. He then joined the Ford Foundation as
financial counsel.
   In 1981, Powers joined James D. Wolfensohn Inc., which he
described as a ```boutique' merchant bank; very small with very
large clients.'' He provided financial and strategic advice on
mergers and acquisitions and in early 1982 was asked to help
Jardine Matheson.
   Keswick was impressed with Powers' performance and in 1986 the
American joined the Hong Kong company as executive director
responsible for group strategy, corporate finance and financial
services.
   Powers, a sandy-haired man who exudes confidence and good humor
in his appearances at news conferences, quickly was named managing
director of Jardine Matheson and its three principal public holding
companies, and joint managing director of its property arm, Hong
Kong Land.
   On March 25, Keswick made public what had long been suspected,
Powers would become the top Jardine Matheson official in the colony.
   Keswick, chairman and managing director of Jardine Matheson
since 1983, said he would return to Britain after the annual
general meeting in June and serve as the company's non-executive
chairman. His family still retains control of the company through
stock holdings.
   ``When one sees them (Keswick and Powers) operating together,
clearly there is tremendous empathy, they seem to feed off each
others' strengths,'' said Martin Spurrier, a consultant to Jardine
Matheson who worked in the group for 13 years. ``Brian's not only a
strategic thinker but he's a doer.''
   Powers, who speaks furiously fast and displays total recall,
said he is excited about becoming taipan.
   ``Before I do anything there are always two things I ask myself:
Do I think I'll enjoy it and will it be challenging.''
   Powers takes over a company was nearing bankruptcy in the early
1980s largely because of a collapse in the local property market
and a shipping slowdown. But it earned $101 million last year, up
64 percent from 1986.
   Jardine Matheson employs more than 23,000 people in 22 countries
while its affiliates have 53,000 people. About three-quarters of
its business activity is in Hong Kong, but overseas operations are
expected to expand, Powers said.
   ``In terms of new busineses, of the acquisitions necessary to
allow us continued growth, we have to look to overseas markets,''
Powers said. ``This is a natural pattern because the big groups
with big capital and the family-controlled businesses in Hong Kong
limit buying ability.''
   For example, he noted that after two years of searching, the
largest Hong Kong business Jardine Matheson could find worth
purchasing was the 37-outlet Optical Shops. The price tag was $35
million.
   Other interests in the conglomerate include the Mandarin
Oriental hotel group, life insurance, 7-Eleven convenience stores
and Pizza Hut franchises.
   All this makes Powers ``excited at the big challenge of a
multifaceted, diversified business'' that involves ``not one big
issue but a series of issues to be faced every day.''
   Powers, who will head the empire from his 48th-floor office
above the colony's famed harbor, also said he's glad to be facing
these challenges in Hong Kong, a teeming territory of 5.7 million
people, whom he describes as ``wonderfully pragmatic.''
   He has stressed the company headquarters will remain in Hong
Kong even though Jardine Matheson set up a firm in Bermuda four
years ago as the group's ultimate holding company. The move was
made to ease the anxiety of trading partners about Hong Kong's
future after 1997, when China regains sovereignty over the
territory.
   The new taipan was born Aug. 25, 1949, ``so that makes me an
ox,'' he said in reference to one of 12 animals in the Chinese
zodiac. People born under the sign of the ox are said to be
marathon workers and empire-builders.
   Powers and his wife, Paula, have a son, 8-year-old Jeremy. The
new taipan enjoys tennis and golf, frequents the theater and has a
fondness for Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.
   Powers taught at Stanford University Law School before entering
the business world and says he would one day like to return to
teaching.

   For the next 18 months, those in a hurry here can
fuel up their cars and themselves in one stop in what's believed to
be the nation's first combination fast food, gasoline outlet.
   The city was chosen as the test market for an 18-month joint
venture, which began Thursday, by Miami-based Burger King Corp. and
Chicago-based Amoco Oil Co.
   ``Basically, we're both in the energy industry,'' said Suanne
Map, a Burger King spokeswoman in Denver. ``Amoco provides food for
the car and we provide the food for the body.''
   Walt Knake, an Amoco marketing specialist, said both companies'
clientele are similar.
   ``Our typical customer is between 18 and 49. So that means our
customers will match up pretty well with Burger King's customers,''
he said. ``And the typical Amoco and Burger King customer wants
speed. They want to save time.''
   Amoco's end of the operation consists of four pump islands, a
security booth and a cashier. The Burger King restaurant sits at
the rear of a 150-foot lot and consists of a drive-through and
walkup window but no sit-down service.
   Burger King customers can use their Amoco credit card to pay for
food.
   Amoco first approached Burger King in early 1986 with the idea,
Knake said. He said the operation will be evaluated during the next
18 months.
   ``There are no plans to roll it out, because we don't know how
it's going to work,'' he said. ``We're going to have to evaluate
it.''

<HEAD>Japanese Investment In U.S. Real Estate To Remain Strong, Bank
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese appetite for U.S. real estate
is expected to remain strong this year but may not exceed the $6
billion they invested last year, Bank of America said Thursday.
   ``At minimum, we expect Japanese investment to be equal to or
slightly below 1987 levels,'' said Jack S. Cooper, managing
director of the bank's Investment Real Estate Group.
   The Japanese remain concerned about volatility in the U.S. stock
market as well as the nation's huge trade and budget deficits. But
Cooper said in a statement that if there is improvement in ``the
global economic and political issues that are causing'' those
concerns, the amount invested in this country could be
substantially higher than last year.
   Investment will continued to be focused on the west and east
coasts, but the Japanese increasingly are looking beyond the major
cities for opportunities. Among the new spots to draw attention are:
   _Atlanta. More than 150 Japanese companies have established
subisidiaries in Atlanta, according to Bank of America, and that
will serve as a magnet for more Japanese investment.
   _Nashville, Tenn. The bank cites Tennessee officials as saying
about 10,000 workers are employed by Japanese firms within the
state. As in the case of Atlanta, that is likely to lead to
additional real estate investment there.
   _Portland, Ore. The city is becoming ``an increasingly
well-known market in Japan'' largely because of its own promotion
efforts, the bank noted.
   _Seattle. Bank of America noted that this city is particularly
convenient because of simple airline connections to Japan.
Investors are likely to be attracted by its port and diverse
economy.
   _San Diego. Physical limitation of the city's growth, because of
the Pacific Ocean, the Mexican border and the desert, increase the
potential for strong real estate appreciation, the bank said.
   _Washington, D.C. Japanese recognize the city's growing demand
for offices, housing and shopping centers, the bank said.
   _Sacramento, Calif. Japanese investors are likely to turn to
this city as an alternative to the higher-priced San Francisco and
Los Angeles markets, Bank of America said.
   _Phoenix. Continued population growth of this city has
maintained a need for apartments and shopping centers.

<HEAD>Delaware Supreme Court Upholds TWA Against Howard Hughes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Delaware Supreme Court has upheld
damages and interest awarded to Trans World Airlines in a 25-year
legal battle with the late Howard R. Hughes and his Hughes Tool Co.
   In a ruling dated April 4, the state's highest court upheld an
award of more than $48.3 million in damages plus interest against
the Hughes Tool Co., also known as Toolco.
   A Chancery Court in January last year awarded TWA more than
$17.2 million plus pre-judgment interest of about $31.1 million.
Post judgment interest was allowed only on the damage award.
   TWA filed the lawsuit in 1962, claiming the defendants had
breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty by deliberately
interfering with TWA's commercial success to benefit themselves.
   At that time, Hughes owned 78 percent of TWA stock. According to
the ruling, Toolco used its control position to TWA's detriment. It
said that because of Hughes' evasive nature, Toolco was slow to
order jets TWA needed to remain competitive.
   Toolco appealed to the state Supreme Court and TWA filed a cross
appeal.
   TWA sought to have post-judgment interest calculated on both the
damage award and pre-judgment interest.
   The state Supreme Court said the claim was without merit because
Delaware courts ``have traditionally disfavored the practice of
compounding interest, and we see no reason to depart from that rule
here.''
   Toolco appealed on four issues, including a clain it did not
breach its fiduciary duty to TWA through its failure to place an
earlier order for Boeing jets.
   Toolco claimed TWA did not need that type of jet. Toolco
contended it should not be held accountable for TWA's lost profits
due to Toolco's failure to order such aircraft.
   The Supreme Court held that Toolco's argument ``ignores the fact
that the intrinsic fairness test placed the burden upon Toolco to
prove that it was not the cause of TWA's lost profits,'' and Toolco
failed to meet that burden.
   Toolco also disputed the inclusion of accounting changes made by
TWA in late 1963 in calculating damages. The ruling said, however,
that ``there was no error or abuse of discretion'' by including the
accounting changes in calculating the damages through 1963.
   In its final argument, Toolco claimed it was erroneous to use an
interest rate in excess of the legal rate in calculating the
pre-judgment interest.
   But the Supreme Court noted that Chancery Court is a court of
equity and ``has broad discretion, subject to principles of
fairness, in fixing the rate to be applied.'' In Chancery Court,
the ``legal rate is a mere guide, not an inflexible rule,'' the
ruling said.
   ``In selecting the interest rate the trial court considered the
nature of the plaintiff, the nature of the wrong remedied, and the
peculiar facts of the case. Each of those factors was appropriate,
and there was no abuse of discretion in the court's choice of
rate,'' the ruling said.

<HEAD>Stockbroker Charged in Guinness Affair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police charged David Mayhew, a partner with
British investment firm Cazenove and Co., with three offenses
related to Guinness PLC's 1986 takeover of Distillers Co.
   Mayhew was arrested Thursday and taken to a London police
station to answer questions about the Guinness affair and was later
charged.
   The first charge accuses him of inducing Distillers shareholders
to dispose of their shares ``by dishonest concealment of a material
fact,'' the police said.
   The second charge alleges unlawful financial assistance, and the
third accuses him of involvement with an undisclosed party, which
purchased Distillers shares in April 1986.
   Mayhew, who was released, is scheduled to appear in a London
magistrate's court on Friday to hear the charges.
   He is the seventh person to be charged by British police in
connection with the Guinness affair.
   The other accused are former Guinness chairman Ernest Saunders;
Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director for Morgan
Grenfell and Co. Ltd.; financier Sir Jack Lyons; Heron Corp.
Chairman Gerald Ronson; Lord Spens, a former director of Henry
Ansbacher and Co.; and stockbroker Anthony Parnes.
   British police have also issued a warrant for the arrest of
former Guinness director Thomas Ward, a Washington lawyer.
   Guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for
company outsiders to purchase the brewer's shares to boost their
price in order to make Guinness' cash and stock offer for
Distillers more attractive than a rival bid.
   Cazenove, which acted as Guinness' broker during the Distillers
bid, reaffirmed on Thursday a 1987 statement in which Cazenove
denied that any of its representatives broke the law or offered
``improper indemnities or inducements'' to purchase Distillers
shares.
   Cazenove insisted on Mayhew's innocence, saying he would remain
a partner and would continue to have the firm's complete support.

   Stock prices gained ground in an erratic session
today, getting a bit more mileage out of Wednesday's strong rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 64.16 points on
Wednesday, rose another 7.46 to 2,069.13 by 3 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 951 up, 532 down and
477 unchanged.
   Analysts said new signs of stability in the dollar had touched
off rallies in stock markets around the world.
   The Tokyo market climbed today to new highs, having recovered
all the ground it lost in last year's crash.
   But the U.S. bond market showed less life. Prices of long-term
government bonds declined slightly this morning, putting their
yields in the 8.75-8.8 percent range.
   And brokers said many traders were reluctant to chase after
stocks while talk persists that the Federal Reserve might be
leaning toward a tighter credit policy, and that leading banks
might soon raise their prime lending rates.
   Among Japanese issues traded in the U.S. markets, Honda Motor
gained 3] to 141] and Matsushita Electrical rose 4[ to 224[.
   Irving Bank jumped 4 to 68[ on speculation that the company,
which is fighting a takeover bid by Bank of New York, might be
close to reaching a deal with another party.
   General Electric was unchanged at 41} in active trading. The
company reported first-quarter earnings of 80 cents a share,
against 68 cents in the comparable period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.68 to 150.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.12 at 298.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 153.42 million shares with an

<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. said its profit in
the first quarter rose 16 percent from a year earlier, boosted by
favorable results from all its businesses.
   GE said Thursday that its first-quarter profit increased to $725
million, or 80 cents a share, from $624 million, or 68 cents a
share, in the first three months of 1987.
   Sales for the first quarter declined 4 percent, to $7.9 billion
from $8.3 billion a year earlier.
   ``We expect double-digit improvement in earnings to continue
throughout the year, given the current economic environment,'' GE
Chairman John F. Welch Jr. said. ``Every GE business is on plan,
and virtually all contributed to another strong quarter with
particularly good earnings increases reported by plastics,
financial services and aerospace.''
   On Tuesday the board of directors of Roper Corp., an appliance
company based in Augusta, Ga., approved the acquisition of Roper by
GE. The purchase for $507 million, or $54 a share, is expected to
be completed next week.
   Welch said the acquisition of Roper ``will significantly
strengthen (GE's) appliance business in an increasingly competitive
global market.''

<TEXT>
   Four years and two months after the start of an
epic legal battle between two oil industry rivals, it took just 10
minutes Thursday for Texaco Inc. to deliver a $3 billion settlement
into the bank account of Pennzoil Co.
   A half-dozen tight-lipped executives from Texas Commerce
Bank-Houston and Pennzoil huddled around a computer terminal in a
sterile bank office, waiting like expectant parents for the green
computer screen to signal the beginning of the largest cash
settlement in the nation's judicial history.
   ``I'll be glad when it's over,'' a tense Dave Alderson,
assistant treasurer of Pennzoil, said. ``It'll be a relief.''
   Bank officials warned about a dozen reporters and photographers
before escorting them into Room 1760 of the bank's Electronic
Services Division-Funds Transfer Section that the place was a
high-security area and they would not be allowed to wander.
   Ironically, the bank is two blocks south of Pennzoil's Houston
headquarters and two blocks north of the downtown Texaco Building.
   Margo Somers, an operations officer at Texas Commerce Bank,
repeatedly punched in the Pennzoil account number on her terminal
to see if the Texaco money electronically appeared on the bank
ledger.
   ``This is the largest one I've ever handled,'' she said.
   To get an idea of how much $3 billion really is, consider this:
If you spent $1 every second, it would take 92 years to go through
$3 billion. If comprised of $1 bills only, the stack would reach
203 miles high and weigh 3,061 tons, according to Ira Polikoff, a
spokesman at the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
   At Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which handled Texaco's end
of the transaction from New York, James P. Witkins, a senior vice
president, gathered the cash from 26 or 27 banks using a task force
of four people.
   ``It's not really the raw money itself, it's the sensitivity and
the technicality,'' he said. ``You want the thing to shut out in
one day. Three billion dollars works out to about a half a million
dollars a day in interest. Money like that doesn't sit around
idle.''
   At 10:03 a.m CDT, the first payment _ $600 million _ came in to
Houston.
   ``So far, so good,'' someone said.
   Alderson smiled faintly.
   Bank officials notified Manufacturers Hanover the payment had
been received.
   Then they waited, eyes still glued to the computer screen.
   There was little small talk. The minutes dragged. A bank
spokesman explained that the next wire transfer probably was hung
up in the computer queue behind other business.
   Mrs. Somers typed in the Pennzoil account number again.
   Payment No. 2 arrived at 10:10 a.m. Pennzoil had another $800
million.
   Alderson smiled a bit more.
   He and Linda Condit, director of treasury operations for
Pennzoil, scribbled notes on legal pads.
   At 10:12 a.m., another $700 million appeared in the Pennzoil
account.
   Alderson's smile grew.
   Just a minute later, at 10:13 a.m., the fourth and largest
single payment _ $900 million _ arrived.
   ``There it is,'' Mrs. Somers said. ``It's all in.''
   Alderson flashed a $3 billion grin.
   A few people began applauding.
   ``We're all very glad it's all over,'' Alderson said, accepting
congratulations, but hurrying out of the room.
   ``Going to call the boss?'' a reporter asked.
   ``Exactly right,'' the assistant treasurer said.
   A few blocks away, Joe Jamail, the colorful Houston attorney who
headed the Pennzoil legal team and stands to make millions from the
case, was in court, trying another case.
   ``I don't have any gloating feeling,'' he said. ``I'm just glad
that the system of justice prevailed and we won. Now I hope they
(Texaco) quit crying about it.''

   Assets of the nation's 420 money market mutual
funds fell $1.43 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $276.8 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $548.3 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 210 general purpose funds rose $781.7 million to $83.64
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds increased $356.5 million
to $117.4 billion, and assets of 112 institutional funds declined
$2.57 billion to $75.76 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.05 percent from 6.04 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield was unchanged at 6.05 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, down from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
5.68 percent as of Wednesday from 5.70 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.81
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.78 the
previous week. Yields were 7.14 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.12
percent; 7.56 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.53 percent; and
8.01 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 7.99 percent.

<TEXT>
   Maui and Sons, the fast-growing maker of
beachgoer garb, has found itself the victim of shifting tides of
fashion.
   The Orange County-based surfwear company sought protection from
creditors by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal
court on Tuesday, listing liabilities of $7.1 million and assets of
$2.5 million.
   The company listed more than 200 creditors in court documents.
   ``We just needed the Chapter 11 to get over the cash-flow glitch
that was created from the fall line not doing well,'' said the
company's attorney, William Lobel.
   ``Fortunately for us, the demand for Maui and Sons clothing
right now is extraordinary. The company's problem is ... finding
the cash to buy the merchandise to fill the orders,'' Lobel said.
   Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company is
protected from creditors and permitted to continue operating and
restructure itself under court supervision.
   The surfwear industry is fast-growing but highly volatile, made
up mostly of tiny entrepreneurial companies. Sales industrywide
this year are expected to be between $1 billion and $3 billion.
   Maui and Sons is considered a leader in the industry even though
its annual sales are only $12 million.

<HEAD>Foreigners Own Nearly 1 Percent of U.S. Agricultural Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners continue to own just under 1
percent of U.S. agricultural land, slightly more than the level of
a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said its 1987
year-end review of reports under the Agricultural Foreign
Investment Disclosure Act found 12.5 million acres of agricultural
land in foreign hands, 202,000 acres more than reported in 1986.
   Of the land owned by foreign interests, 50 percent was forest
land, 17 percent cropland, 28 percent pasture and other
agricultural land, and 5 percent used for non-agricultural purposes
or unreported.
   Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land, with the
balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other
entities.
   As in the past, much of the ownership is concentrated in the
United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, the Netherlands Antilles and
Switzerland. Those countries combined to account for 69 percent of
the foreign-held acreage, the agency said.
   Maine continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign
ownership, with holdings of almost 1.79 million acres, mostly
timberland, or more than 14 percent of the total.
   ``Ninety-three percent of the foreign-owned acreage will remain
in agricultural production, according to foreign owners,'' the
report said.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Top $17 a Barrel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices put on a late rally and broke past $17 a
barrel Thursday, with traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange
looking ahead to a weekend OPEC committee meeting on prices.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly higher,
livestock were mostly weaker, and precious metals were mixed.
   Most of the action in the energy markets was buying to offset
earlier sales to square away accounts before the price committee
meeting, said Andrew Lebow, an analyst in New York with E.D.& F.
Man International Futures Inc.
   ``There's the general expectation that the price committee isn't
going to do anything substantial,'' he said. ``In fact, they have
no power to do much of anything.
   ``But there's still some fear that OPEC could throw a curve
ball'' and take meaningful steps to stabilize international oil
prices, he said.
   Gasoline and heating oil futures also advanced, responding to
firm demand and to the rally in crude oil, said Lebow.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 26 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $17.06 a barrel;
heating oil was .39 cent to .71 cent higher with May at 45.73 cents
a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .40 cent higher
with May at 48.82 cents a gallon.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower, while pork bellies advanced
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The cattle market is basically on the fence,'' said Chuck
Levitt, an analyst in Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   A recent bull market appears to have stalled because the profit
margins of processors and retailers are very thin and they see
larger supplies later in the spring, he said.
   ``So they're not willing to commit themselves in a big way to
feature or push beef.''
   This means processors are resisting paying top dollar for live
cattle, but at the same time there is no surplus of market-ready
animals, so the producers aren't willing to drastically cut their
prices.
   Pork futures are stymied by their high price compared with the
cash market, Levitt said.
   ``The premium (about $7 a hundredweight) is about as wide as
it's been any time in the 1980s,'' he said.
   ``So before they can move ahead, futures need cash prices to
catch up,'' said Levitt.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with the
April contract at 73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .20 cent lower with April at 79.57 cents a pound; live hogs were
.45 cent lower to .27 cent higher with April at 45.35 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to .40 cent higher
with May at 53.32 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices put on a late rally and pulled corn a
little higher at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A large speculator who had driven prices up earlier in the week
came into the market as a buyer again, said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   This forced traders, who had sold earlier in the hope of prices
would decline, to start buying to limit their losses.
   Trading in the grains was relatively quiet.
   Corn was helped by the rally in beans while wheat has some
underlying support from the Soviet Union bidding on a half million
tons of the grain and the expectation that India may be interested
in buying some.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 4{ cents higher with the May contract
at $3.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2\ cents higher with May
at $2.07{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1} cents higher with May
at $1.65 a bushel; and soybeans were 5} cents to 7\ cents higher
with May at $6.73 a bushel.
   Gold futures moved higher while silver was a little lower at the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.80 higher with the June contract at
$452.70 a troy ounce; and silver was 3 cents lower with May at
$6.435 a troy ounce.
   Stock index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index contract settled .20 point higher at 267.60. The underlying
spot index closed .67 point higher at 266.16.

   An employee for the Merrill Lynch financial
services company who was about to be fired walked into the firm's
office on Thursday and fatally shot his boss, police said.
   George Cook, the manager of the office, was pronounced dead at
Massachusetts General Hospital about two hours after being rushed
there with chest and leg wounds.
   Witnesses said the suspect, Lonnie Gilchrist, was wrestled to
the floor by other employees after firing several shots in the
office on the 36th floor of a downtown building. He was arrested
and charged with homicide, said police spokesman James Jordan.
   Several employees contacted by telephone said they were
instructed not to comment on the incident.
   Jordan said a preliminary investigation found the suspect was
about to be fired.
   Cook, 56, was an employee of Merrill Lynch for 31 years, said
company spokesman Fred Yager. Gilchrist has worked there for less
than two years, Yeager said.
   A Merrill Lynch office manager in Florida was killed and a
broker wounded after last October's stock market plunge, by a
customer informed he owed the firm $138,000. The investor then
killed himself.

<HEAD>All Three Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
rose in late March, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $768.3 billion in the week
ended March 28 from $766.3 billion the previous week.
   Ther central bank said a broader measure known as M2 rose $4.6
billion to a seasonally adjusted $2,979.5 billion from $2,974.9
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $3.2 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,746.7 billion from $3,743.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $760.2 billion, a 3.7
percent rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $456 million in
the week ended March 30, compared with a decline of $131 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings from the
Federal Reserve System averaged $426 million a day in the week
ended Wednesday, down from $220 million the previous week. The
latest two-week average was $323 million, up from $239 million in
the previous two weeks.

<NOTE>Eds: Herrmann is cq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal regulators closed two banks on
Thursday and deposits from both of the failed institutions were
assumed by other organizations, officials said.
   Central National Bank of Dallas was closed by federal
regulators, and the Texas banking commissioner ordered Home State
Bank, Trent, Texas closed, said Bill Olcheski of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in Washington.
   Poor lending practices were cited in the demise of both banks.
   The FDIC board of directors approved the assumption of the
deposits and fully secured liaibilities of Central National Bank by
Deposit Guaranty Bank, also of Dallas, he said.
   The board also approved the transfer of insured deposits and
fully secured or preferred deposits of Home State Bank to The
Farmers and Merchants National Bank of Merkel, said Olcheski.
   The two bank closings brought the total number of Texas bank
failures so far this year to 18, with one assistance transaction,
said Olcheski. Nationwide, 48 banks have failed and the FDIC has
provided eight assistance transactions.
   Federal regulators cited problem loans and a lack of supervision
as causes for Central National's rapid deterioration.
   The bank was declared insolvent by Robert J. Herrmann, senior
deputy comptroller for bank supervision of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, said agency spokesman Dale Underwood.
   Central National Bank received a national bank charter on March
4, 1983. On March 29, 1988 it had total assets off approximately
$14 million.
   Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth W. Littlefield announced the
closing of Home State Bank in Trent. The bank had deposits of
approximately $6 million.
   Littlefield said a recent examination identified losses on loans
that depleted the bank's capital. Major losses were attributed to
poor lending practices of former management and a weak local
economy, he said. Efforts to recapitalize the 67-year-old
institution were unsuccessful.

<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against most major
currencies Thursday, as transitory hopes of an international
agreement to support the U.S. currency faded.
   Gold prices rose slightly. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid price for gold of $448.85 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up from $448.25 late Wednesday.
   The dollar had risen earlier in the week, propped up by news
reports that finance ministers of the seven major industrialized
countries were likely to set a floor for the U.S. currency at a
meeting next week. The advance continued Thursday in the Far East
and Europe, but later ran out of steam in New York, as a modicum of
bearish dollar sentiment returned.
   The Group of Seven, due to meet next Wednesday, is comprised of
the United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and
Canada.
   Currency dealers noted that the dollar's decline was moderate
and trading was fairly light.
   ``The dollar was fairly firm,'' said Dan Holland, a trader for
Discount Corp. in New York.
   He said the currency's fall was cushioned somewhat by
encouraging remarks on the nation's trade deficit by U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter. The dollar has been hammered in
recent months by negative news on the trade deficit _ which has
indicated to traders that the currency might have to fall further
in order for U.S. exports to be sufficiently competitive.
   Besides the Group of Seven meeting, currency dealers are also
looking toward the April 14 release of U.S. trade data for February.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.67 Japanese yen to a closing 125.70 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted fractionally higher at 125.85 yen.
At the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar was quoted at
125.72 yen, down from 126.03 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.8670 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8790 late Tuesday. But
later in New York, the pound rose to $1.8756 from $1.8716 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6775 West German marks, down from
1.6790; 1.3864 Swiss francs, down from 1.3893; 5.6885 French
francs, down from 5.6925; 1,243.75 Italian lire, up from 1,243.12;
and 1.2483 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2416.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6810 West German marks, up from 1.6700; 1.3897
Swiss francs, up from 1.3775; 5.7022 French francs, up from 5.6570;
1.8865 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8720; 1,246.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,236.50; and 1.2448 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2401.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion rose to
$450.80 a troy ounce from $449 late Wednesday.
   In London, gold dropped to a late bid price of $447.75 a troy
ounce, down from $449.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich,
Switzerland, it also fell to a late bid of $448.00 an ounce, down
from $449.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.56 an ounce to close at a
bid $447.65. Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.40 a
troy ounce, down from late Wednesday's $6.57.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to
$6.407 a troy ounce from $6.570 late Wednesday.

   Dairy farmers complained Thursday they
are not sharing in the agricultural economy's rebound from the
devastating farm recession of the mid-1980s.
   ``Dairy farmers are facing a rough year while the rest of
agriculture is prospering,'' a farmer told Sen. Charles Grassley,
following the Iowa Republican's remarks to the annual meeting of
the Mid-America Dairymen Inc.
   The farmer, who rose from the audience at the meeting of the
milk marketing and processing cooperative to question the senator,
complained that the price of grain for feeding herds had climbed
while the price paid farmers for their milk has declined.
   ``I can't say I don't disagree,'' Grassley replied. But he noted
a ``healthy turn of events'' and added that in all his years as a
farmer and member of Congress, he'd ``never seen a time when all
segments of agriculture do well at the same time.''
   The government this year reduced dairy price supports by 50
cents a hundredweight and another cut is possible next year because
of surplus production that continued despite an earlier government
herd buyout program.
   Grassley told the meeting that the dairy industry may yet be
able to provide alternatives to future cuts in price supports,
despite efforts to reduce huge federal budget deficits.
   He encouraged dairy farmers to work with cattlemen, as they
recently did in supporting a beef promotion referendum.
   ``The agriculture bloc has become fragmented in recent years,
leading to a dangerous reduction in agriculture's political
support,'' the senator said in his speech to the group. ``The
diverse chorus of voices representing agriculture creates difficult
choices for Congress. As Ben Franklin warned competing factions
more than 200 years ago: `We must all hang together or we shall all
hang separately.'''
   Despite the call for unity, delegates later amended a resolution
that would have encouraged members of the cooperative, with assets
of nearly $367 million, to support the beef referendum. Instead,
the group voted to be neutral on next month's beef vote.
   Tom Townsend, a senior vice president of the cooperative, said
that change in position will be a bargaining chip in negotiations
with cattlemen to seek their support for dairy programs.
   One recent example of unity in the dairy industry was a
unanimous recommendation from its National Commission on Dairy
Policy, presented March 31 to Congress and the Secretary of
Agriculture.
   The proposals by the 18-member panel of dairy farmers from
around the country was the first unified industry proposal in more
than a decade, said Clyde Rutherford, a Syracuse, N.Y. farmer who
is chairman of the commission and president of Dairylea Milk.
   ``Everything we've done in the past has been a quick fix,''
Rutherford said in an interview after he addressed the Mid-America
Dairymen. He said the commission tried to come up with a dairy
policy to carry the industry through the end of the century.
   ``The commission concluded federal policy should create an
economic environment that makes profitability possible _but not
guaranteed _for the nation's milk producers,'' he told the
convention. ``Those who are efficient, innovative and industrious
will benefit under the commission's plan.''
   He also noted that while the recommendations were unanimous,
they also were controversial, adding, ``There is something for
everyone to dislike.''
   For example, it favors an end to California's separate
manufacturing allowance for milk made into butter, cheese and
nonfat dry milk.
   Among its major proposals, the commission recommended:
   _Giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority to
raise or lower dairy price supports by 5 percent, with a one-year
limit of 50 cents a hundredweight.
   _Giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority to
impose production controls when government purchases of surplus
milk exceed 5 billion pounds in one year, and requiring production
controls if surplus stocks rise to 7.5 billion pounds.
   _Providing the secretary of agriculture with two options for
future production controls: a herd buyout program similar to the
one that removed 1.1 million cows and heifers from the nation's
herds in 1986-87 or a ``two-tiered'' price system that would
provide a reduced price for any milk marketings above a set quota.
   _Support of quotas to limit imports of dairy products to keep
the United States from becoming a dumping ground for world foreign
dairy surpluses.
   Delegates at the 20th annual meeting of the Mid-America Dairymen
later adopted their own legislative goals that included a call for
de-emphasizing the use of price supports as a means of controlling
dairy supplies.

   Stock prices worked their way higher in an
erratic session Thursday, getting a bit more mileage out of
Wednesday's strong rally.
   As has been the case for much of the time this year, smaller
stocks turned in a better showing than the big-name blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 64.16
points Wednesday, edged up another 0.50 to 2,062.17.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 988 up, 541 down and 473 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 177.84 million shares, against 181.76
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
.52 to 150.28.
   Over the past three days the Dow Jones industrial average has
gained 81.47 points.
   Analysts said new signs of stability in the dollar had touched
off rallies in stock markets around the world.
   The Tokyo stock market climbed Thursday to new highs, having
recovered all the ground it lost in last year's crash.
   But the U.S. bond market showed less life. Prices of long-term
government bonds declined slightly, putting their yields in the
8.75-8.8 percent range.
   And brokers said many traders were reluctant to chase after
stocks while talk persists that the Federal Reserve might be
leaning toward a tighter credit policy, and that leading banks
might soon raise their prime lending rates.
   Among Japanese stocks traded in the U.S. markets, Honda Motor
gained 3 to 141; Matsushita Electrical 3} to 223}; Hitachi 1[ to
116{, and Sony | to 43].
   Those four were among 30 Big Board issues that made new 52-week
highs during the session, while 10 hit new lows.
   UNC Resources rose 2| to 10}. Odyssey Partners, a private
investor group, said it holds a 5.84 percent interest in UNC and
might seek to buy it out.
   Lucky Stores gained 3} to 52{. The company said it considered a
takeover bid by American Stores at either $45 a share or $50 a
share inadequate, and is considering several alternatives.
   Irving Bank jumped 3} to 67~ on speculation that the company,
which is fighting a takeover bid by Bank of New York, might be
close to reaching a deal with another party.
   General Electric was down { at 41\ in active trading, despite
the company's report that its first-quarter earnings reached 80
cents a share, against 68 cents in the comparable period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.0 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 206.71 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.02 to 309.73,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.67 at 266.16.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.14 to 378.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 299.38, up 1.80.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Piedmont Airlines announced price
reductions Thursday on nonrefundable fares for tickets purchased by
April 17, joining two other airlines which cut prices earlier this
week.
   None of the fares exceed $198 roundtrip, including those for
transcontinental travel, and they apply to Piedmont flights between
noon on Mondays and noon on Thursdays throughout the U.S. route
system.
   The fares are available for flights scheduled between April 18
and June 15.
   ``The timing of this sale is perfect for parents hoping to
attend their children's graduation ceremonies at distant colleges
and universities, for couples planning budget honeymoons to extend
their travel range to include a Florida resort, and for kids to get
an extra visit from their grandparents,'' said J. Daniel Brock,
Piedmont's senior vice president of marketing.
   Once tickets are purchased, plans cannot be changed. The fares
may not apply to some routes served by Piedmont regional and
commuter airline partners.
   The price reduction comes two days after Eastern Airlines and
Continental Airlines, the nation's sixth-largest and fifth-ranked
airlines, respectively, said they were cutting some fares in
anticipation of a slack period coming up for leisure travel.
   Although there are some minor differences, Eastern and
Continental introduced similar programs. The non-refundable tickets
must be purchased by April 14 (starting Tuesday for Eastern and
Wednesday for Continental), and used for travel from April 18
through June 15.
   Passengers must travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday.
Round-trip travel and a Saturday night stay are required.
   Those restrictions limit the program to eight travel days in
April, 18 days in May and nine in June.

<HEAD>Lucky Stores Rejects Takeover Bid</HEAD>

   Lucky Stores Inc. has rejected a takeover
bid by American Stores Co. that could have created the nation's
largest supermarket chain, officials announced Thursday.
   Lucky's board said in a statement it had unanimously rejected
American Stores' unsolicited tender offer of $1.74 billion, or $45
a share, as ``inadequate'' and not in the best interests of the
company or its stockholders.
   The board also rejected a proposal by the Salt Lake City-based
company to increase its bid to $50 a share in a negotiated
acquisition.
   The rejection of American Stores' surprise tender offer three
weeks ago for Lucky's 38.6 million shares outstanding occurred 17
months after the Dublin-based company derailed a hostile takeover
attempt by New York investor Asher Edelman.
   Mike Holt, American Stores vice president for investor public
relations, said his company had no comment on the announcement.
   Lucky's stock closed at $52.50 per share on the New York Stock
Exchange Thursday, up $3.75 from Wednesday's $48.75 per-share close.
   Lucky's board also authorized company management and advisers to
consider other alternatives to boost its value, including possible
reorganization to focus on California operations, a leveraged
recapitalization with possible distributions to stockholders by a
dividend or share repurchase, and a negotiated sale of the company
to a third party.
   ``We are confident that pursuit of one of these alternatives
will provide our best opportunity to achieve greater value for our
stockholders,'' said John M. Lillie, Lucky's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Lucky also announced its board adopted a warrant dividend plan
and has declared a dividend under the plan of one common stock
purchase right for each share of outstanding common stock, payable
to stockholders of record on April 8.
   In its statement, Lucky said that its financial adviser, Goldman
& Sachs & Co., advised the board the $45 tender offer and the $50
alternative were inadequate.
   Salomon Brothers Inc., financial adviser to the non-management
directors, also advised the board the American Stores proposal was
financially inadequate, the company said.
   Lucky, California's No. 2 supermarket chain, has 480 outlets,
340 within the state.
   American Stores, a grocery and drugstore chain, had indicated it
would convert its struggling 240 Alpha Beta outlets in California
to Lucky stores. If successful, the move would have transformed
Lucky into California's No. 1 grocery chain.
   A successful merger of American Stores, with 1,700 outlets in 40
states, and Lucky would have make Lucky the nation's largest
supermarket chain, surpassing No. 1 Kroger Co.
   American Stores last year posted $14.3 billion in annual sales;
Lucky had $6.9 billion.
   In 1984, American Stores acquired Jewel Cos. of Chicago, paving
the way for an extensive consolidation aimed at creating the
nation's first coast-to-coast drugstore chain.
