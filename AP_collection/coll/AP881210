   An international arms dealer of Armenian descent was
loading three cargo planes Friday to fly medical personnel and
supplies to the catastrophic earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   Sarkis Soghanalian, owner of Pan-Aviation Inc., said he was
preparing to fly three Boeing 707s loaded with relief supplies
donated by south Florida's community of about 2,000 Armenians.
   ``It's every human being's obligation _ when you get somebody
coming down, you have to help them to come up,'' Soghanalian said.
``The people are amazing. They are sending us all kinds of stuff.''
   Soghanalian, 58, a Lebanese national of Armenian descent who
lives in Miami, faces charges of trying to smuggle an arsenal of 103
combat helicopters worth $200 million to Iraq. The terms of his bond
in the case allow him to travel anywhere in the world, according to
his lawyer, Neal Sonnett.
   Soghanalian was given five years probation in 1982 in a
wire-fraud case stemming from an arms deal in which he bilked $1.1
million from a British competitor, Boca Investments.
   He also made headlines last January when he sent a plane to
Hawaii in what was reportedly an aborted attempt to return deposed
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to his homeland.

   The 7-foot-tall living Christmas tree in
Charles and Arlene Heraly's front yard is gone _ lights and all.
   Vandals chopped down and carried off the spruce that the Heralys
had treasured for a decade since their three children gave it to
them.
   Police said Friday they have no suspects in Wednesday's theft.
   ``We all watched it grow,'' Arlene said. ``It means so much to
us.''
   Each year at this time Heraly, 74, and his 72-year-old wife set
up a life-sized Nativity scene next to the tree. Each Christmas Eve,
a life-sized infant Jesus is placed in the manger. The honor of
placing the model in the manger has passed from their nine
grandchildren to their three great-grandchildren.
   ``It wouldn't mean so much if it hadn't been given to us,'' Mrs.
Heraly said.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has ordered hearings
on damage claims against the state in the Beverly Hills Supper Club
fire that killed 165 people in 1977.
   The Kentucky Board of Claims had summarily dismissed a group of
claims filed against the state by the estates of seven victims of
the fire at the club in Southgate in northern Kentucky.
   The state Court of Appeals said Friday that the board and other
administrative agencies have no statutory authority to dismiss
claims on their own.
   The seven claims were consolidated when the board's action was
appealed to Campbell Circuit Court. The circuit court was upheld by
the 2-1 appellate ruling.
   Saying it had the ``inherent'' power to do so, the board
dismissed the claims without notice in 1987. The board said it would
not have been liable to the claimants, anyway.
   But the appeals court said that administrative agencies, unlike
courts, have no ``inherent'' powers.
   The board was created by the General Assembly to handle damage
claims against state agencies.
   The claims at issue were not filed against a specific state
agency. The Board of Claims suggested the proper agency would be the
Department of Housing, Buildings and Construction, which includes
the state fire marshal's office, the appeals court said.

<TEXT>
   At lunchtime every Friday, it's not
difficult to find Yale University's bursar: He's out picketing the
Ivy League school's health services building in a one-man protest
against Yale abortion policies.
   Francis R. Nicoll, 58, the university's bursar since 1974, began
his weekly picketing in January and has missed only a couple Fridays
since then.
   ``You need to do things regularly that you believe in,'' said
Nicoll, who is also Yale's assistant treasurer. ``That is all that
is needed. You don't have to make a lot of noise.''
   Nicoll, who believes abortions under all circumstances are wrong,
said his protest is aimed at a policy that he said requires
everyone, including students and parents opposed to abortions, to
help pay for the procedures.
   Mandatory health fees, which support the operations of University
Health Services, are included in tuition.
   Nicoll said he was told by a source at the health services
center, which also provides care to university employees, that an
average of four to five abortions are performed a week.
   But Alan West, a health services spokesman, said the figure was
significantly lower and included both students and Yale employees.
Abortions are performed only one morning a week at the center, he
said.
   Nicoll, who is joined by his wife about two Fridays a month,
carries the same large picket at each of his protests. It reads:
``Yale Brutally Murders Unborn Children Here Each Week.''
   Nicoll, a 1952 Yale graduate and founder of a group called Yale
for Life, also hands out literature.
   About one-third of the students who enter the building accept his
literature, he said. The rest either ignore him or tell him they
oppose his position.
   ``I don't know of any students seeking an abortion who, because
of Frank Nicoll, say, `I am going to keep the baby and give it up
for adoption,''' West said. ``I think the students are generally on
the liberal side, enough so that they think it's a pesonal
decision.''
   Nicoll said administration officials have not tried to discourage
him from protesting.
   ``On the contrary, they ordinarily say, `You're wrong, we don't
agree with you' or `Way to go,' but they always say , `It's great
you have the freedom to say what you want,''' the bursar said.
   As bursar, Nicoll is responsible for collecting all tuition,
room, board and miscellaneous charges, as well as all student loan
payments.
   He has participated in several anti-abortion marches in
Washington, but said he didn't learn until last fall that abortions
were being performed at the health services center.
   Abortions have been performed at health service since the late
1970s or early 1980s, West said.
   Nicoll said he will continue his weekly protest until Yale
changes its policy.

   Peter Holmes, an assistant managing editor of
The Washington Times, was elected Friday night as the 1989 president
of the National Press Club.
   Holmes defeated Douglas Turner, Washigton bureau chief for the
Buffalo News, by a vote of 334-148 in balloting that attracted one
of the largest turnouts in the club's history.
   NPC Election Committee Chairman Frank Aukofer reported the final
results of the election, which also decided other Press Club
officers and its board of governors.
   In addition to Holmes, other winners of the balloting were:
   Vice President, Judy Grande, Washington correspondent, Cleveland
Plain Dealer. She was unopposed.
   Secretary, Mick Rood, Reporter, States News Service
   Treasurer, Tom Squitieri, Reporter, Boston Herald
   Financial Secretary, Vera Glaser, Editor, Washingtonian magazine.
   Rood defeated Ed Schaefer, a reporter for the Richmond (Ohio)
Daily News, by a vote of 263-221; Squitieri, a reporter for the
Boston Herald who lost a bid for the club's presidency last year,
defeated Jessie Stearns, who runs an independent news service
serving several Kansas newspapers, by a vote of 349-136; and Glaser
defeated syndicated columnist Ralph de Toledano by a vote of 383-103.
   Three people reelected to the club's board were: Kathryn Kahler,
a correspondent for the Newhouse newspaper group; Greg Spears, a
reporter with the Knight-Ridder newspapers and Dennis Melaned, a
correspondent covering defense and energy for McGraw-Hill World News.
   Founded in 1908, the NPC membership includes about 5,000 working
and retired journalists, journalism professors and public relations
professionals.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawmaker from the governing party and
two bodyguards were fatally shot in a new burst of Sinhalese
violence that left at least 10 others dead, military officers said.
   Sunil Gunatillake of the United National Party and his bodyguards
were gunned down near Ingiriya, 25 miles southeast of Colombo.
   The bodies of 10 other men were found at different towns in the
Sinhalese heartland on the south and center of the island, the
officers said Friday.
   They said the victims were apparently Sinhalese militants killed
by the People's Revolutionary Red Army organization, which is
opposed to the extremists.
   The Red Army is regarded as pro-government, but authorities have
denied any connection.
   Sinhalese militants launched a campaign against the government
last year claiming a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil
separatist war gave too many concessions to the minority community.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and the
Sinhalese make up 75 percent. The Tamils, mostly Hindu, say they are
discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese and have been
fighting for an independent homeland since 1983.
   At least 8,500 people have been killed in the war.
   The government says Sinhalese militants have killed at least 900
people, mostly government supporters, since the peace accord was
signed in July 1987.

   Welfare mother Elyse Sanchez had a lot of
confidence when she accepted a teaching fellowship and moved her
children from a rat-infested building in New York to a three-bedroom
apartment in view of open space and corn fields.
   That was in August. Since then, Ms. Sanchez says her confidence
has been tried by the rigors of academia at the University of Iowa
and the unexpected departure of her adopted daughter, Rochelle.
   ``It's harder than I feared it would be. I came to see I didn't
come fully prepared. The education which I received in New York did
not prepare me for graduate school in the 1980s,'' Ms. Sanchez said.
   ``I feel as though I'm beating batter and I'm going to cook it on
a wood stove while everyone else can just pop it in the microwave
oven,'' she said.
   But she's also marveling at the strong sense of community.
   Ms. Sanchez, 35, who had been living in the New York City borough
of the Bronx, made national news when she graduated from Lehman
College in New York last summer with a 4.0 grade-point average, and
was offered the Iowa post.
   Adviser Miriam Gilbert said Ms. Sanchez, who will begin teaching
in the English Department next year, is fitting in nicely.
   ``I don't think it's necessarily the easiest thing in the world
to come with the spotlight on you,'' Ms. Gilbert said. ``In my own
class, she's a wonderful asset, full of contributions and ideas and
sharing a great deal with others in the class.''
   But life at home has been tough. Adopted daughter Rochelle, 17,
who had been with Ms. Sanchez since she was 3 and babysat Ms.
Sanchez' three younger children while Ms. Sanchez got her degree at
Lehman, left in mid-October. The University of Iowa had waived
tuition for Rochelle as part of the fellowship agreement.
   ``She had written something for her rhetoric class. She said she
hated me and always had. It wasn't anything I had done, just being
in the room with me made her angry,'' Ms. Sanchez recalled in an
interview. ``So I said if you're really unhappy here, why don't you
think about maybe leaving.
   ``Within 10 minutes she packed her bags.''
   ``At that point I began to doubt what I was doing here because it
had so many implications,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ``I began to think, `I
want to teach people her age, and if she's so against work, if this
is the attitude an adolescent has and she's my own daughter, how are
a bunch of students going to accept me when I begin teaching next
year?'''
   She decided to tough it out, concentrating on her workload of
three courses and caring for her other three children, aged 12, 11
and almost 9.
   She explained her problems to English Department Chairman John
Raeburn and Ms. Gilbert, and credits the pair with helping her
through that difficult period. She said she wasn't accustomed to
``such a sense of community.''
   ``That's a nice feeling to have here, that people understand
one's problems,'' said Ms. Sanchez. ``I had been told that when I
got here it was going to be very cut-throat, but it hasn't been.''
   Ms. Sanchez said she and her children will go back to New York
for Christmas, but she doesn't miss the city.
   ``I don't feel this constant sense of anxiety anymore. I think I
picked the right place,'' she said. ``The kids like it here, they
absolutely adore it.''
   ``The big threat, my parental threat, is that I'll take them back
to New York if they don't behave,'' she said.

   Sen. Quentin Burdick is recovering from
treatment for seizures and his doctor says the 80-year-old lawmaker
will be ready to go back to work when Congress convenes next month.
   Burdick was discharged from the hospital Friday after a stay of
nearly two weeks, his office said.
   Dr. Janelle Sanda told Burdick to take it easy for the next
couple of weeks, according to a statement released by his office.
   ``We fully expect the senator to be able to begin work full time
when the Senate convenes in January,'' Ms. Sanda said in the
statement.
   Burdick, D-N.D., was taken to St. Luke's Hospitals on Nov. 27
after being stricken with a seizure at his Fargo home.
   Burdick suffers from small-vessel disease, an ailment that leads
to blockages in tiny blood vessels in the brain, Ms. Sanda said. He
was being treated for the seizures with medication, she said.
   Burdick was elected last month to a fifth, six-year term over
Republican Earl Strinden. The senator garnered 60 percent of the
vote despite questions raised about his age and health.

   Morton Downey Jr., the ultraconservative
talk show host known for intimidating and haranguing his guests, has
filed for divorce, charging his wife of 10 years with ``extreme
cruelty.''
   Downey's divorce suit said Kim Cotton Downey's moodiness and
jealousy led her to create public disturbances and embarrass her
husband.
   The couple, married in 1978, have separated since Nov. 1 and have
had no communication for the last several months, said the lawsuit
filed Dec. 1 in Superior Court.
   The action proposes equitable distribution of all property
acquired by the couple during their marriage.
   The lawsuit cites several incidents, including one in 1980 in
Washington, in which she allegedly locked her husband out of their
hotel room, and another in a Princeton restaurant this year in which
she allegedly shouted at him loudly enough for all patrons to hear.
   Mrs. Downey has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment. Downey, 55, would not comment on the matter,
said his assistant, Missy Tshudy.

   Humorist Erma Bombeck, whose last five books have
sold more more than 15 million copies, has signed a three-book
contract with a new publisher, Harper & Row.
   The terms of the contract were not disclosed, but there were
estimates that it was for nearly $12 million.
   ``All I'll say is, it's a good estimate,'' Ms. Bombeck said
Friday. The syndicated newspaper columnist's previous books were
published by McGraw-Hill.
   ``McGraw-Hill is selling off its general book division, so it
wasn't unusual for us to approach another publisher,'' said Bombeck,
61.
   The first of her new books is for children recovering from
cancer, she said. Harper & Row will donate 100,000 copies of the
book _ titled ``I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go
to Boise'' _ to children who want them, Ms. Bombeck said.
   The second book, about family vacations, is scheduled for
publication in the fall of 1990. The topic and publication date of
the third book are not settled, the writer said.

   American television star Bronson Pinchott bought a
rare, 500-year-old manuscript of French plays from Sotheby's with a
winning bid that was six times the top estimate, officials at the
auction house said.
   Pinchott, who lives in Hollywood, paid $218,000 for the book of
miracle plays at an auction of Western manuscripts here Tuesday.
   ``It would have great appeal to someone who spends his whole life
confronting performing scripts,'' said Sotheby's expert, Christopher
de Hamel. The book's value was estimated at just one-sixth the top
bid.
   Pinchott, 29, stars in the ABC comedy ``Perfect Strangers'' as
Balki Bartokomous, a Mediterranean immigrant. The New York-born
actor also appeared in the films ``Risky Business'' and ``Beverly
Hills Cop.''
   Miracle plays dramatizing the lives of saints and miracles were
popular in the Middle Ages and are the foundation of modern
performing arts.
   The manuscript was written in the early 15th century in French
rhyming verse with stage directions in Latin. Each play opens with
the actors blowing trumpets and an angel calling for silence.

   Dolores Ibarruri, the Spanish Communist
leader who became known as the legendary ``La Pasionaria'' because
of her fiery speeches during the Spanish Civil War, quietly
celebrated her 93rd birthday.
   Ibarruri received flowers, telegrams and phone calls Friday, as
well as visits from Soviet, Bulgarian and Romanian diplomats, said
Irene Falcon, her longtime secretary and friend.
   Ibarruri spent the day at home with her daughter, Amaya, and her
granddaughter, Dolores, Falcon said.
   Ibarruri, a founder of the Spanish Communist Party in 1920 and
now the party's figurehead president, won fame during the 1936-39
war for inflammatory radio broadcasts exhorting Republican forces to
defeat Francisco Franco's fascist army.
   The Republicans lost, and Franco took power.
   Ibarruri, who spent 38 years in exile in the Soviet Union,
returned to the Spanish capital in 1977 following Franco's death two
years earlier.

   Actors F. Murray Abraham, George Hearn, Mariel
Hemingway and Christopher Reeve paid tribute to their immigrant
heritage in a ceremony at Ellis Island.
   ``Nearly 17 million immigrants passed through these halls: the
parents or grandparents of almost half of the Americans alive
today,'' said Hearn, known for his role in Broadway's ``Sweeney
Todd.''
   The performers, led by Hearn, read a statement Friday asking
other Americans to remember their immigrant ancestry and to turn
dreams of a better world into reality.
   Abraham enrolled six family members on the American Immigrant
Wall of Honor, a permanent exhibit where Americans can have
ancestors' names inscribed for a $100 donation. The ceremony was
aimed at drawing attention to the wall, which will stop accepting
names in February.
   The island is closed for a $140 million restoration project and
the creation next year of The Ellis Island Immigration Museum.

   One youth was shot dead and seven others
were wounded when rival groups of vocational school students clashed
at an outdoor charity concert, police said today.
   The violence occurred Friday as one of Thailand's most popular
rock bands, Carabao, entertained a crowd of 100,000 at Royal Field
near the walls of Bangkok's Grand Palace to raise funds for victims
of the recent floods and landslides in southern Thailand.
   Police Lt. Winai Rungrugskul said 60 students who were taken into
custody and later released were fined 20 baht (78 cents) each for
possessing knives and clubs.
   Police arrested one vocational student who they said was carrying
a pistol and a plastic bomb. Two homemade bombs exploded at the
concert but no one was injured.
   The Nation English-language newspaper quoted Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Lt. Gen. Manas Krutchaiyant as saying security forces
were outnumbered by the youths and unable to control the crowd.
   ``We were lucky that the explosions were drowned by the music and
most of the concert-goers were not aware of what was happening ...
otherwise there would have been a stampede, '' the paper quoted him
as saying.
   Vocational school students in Thailand have a history of violent
rivalries that have occasionally resulted in deaths.

   Alvin Ailey turns up the heat and speeds the
blood pressure with ``Opus McShann,'' his new dance created to
recordings made by blues and boogie woogie pianist Jay McShann, now
72.
   ``Opus McShann'' is one of Ailey's ``show biz'' dances, which
critics complain about when there are several in a row but miss when
there are none for awhile. ``Opus McShann'' has less glitz and more
effectiveness than some in that category. The New York premiere on
Friday evoked scenes from Kansas City, McShann's headquarters for
much of his career.
   A man in purple tails beckoned the company onto the City Center
stage. They're all dressed up for dancing and strike a fashion-show
pose before cutting loose with some limber-limbed, down-and-dirty
jazz dancing. The woman in the most elegant formal gown will later
prove to be a stripper.
   Carl Bailey and Gary DeLoatch are hilarious as the last drunks
left under a swaying string of lights after a dance. They may be
drunk but they manage some fancy, unison footwork. McShann plays
``Doo Wah Doo'' and sings in his nasal blues style, ``Who's gonna
carry me home? I can't leave that gal alone.''
   Eleven dancers, probably in the bar of a sporting house, dance
``Confessin' the Blues.'' Sharrell Mesh-Alexander dances for an
indifferent Andre Tyson while McShann embellishes and improvises
``Gee Baby Ain't I Good to You?'' into an instrumental anthem.
Finally Tyson wakes up to the sexiness being displayed around him
and pulls Miss Mesh-Alexander, now seated, and her chair into the
wings.
   Marilyn Banks, Desmond Richardson, David St. Charles and Stephen
Smith were outstandingly lithe and snake-hipped to ``I Ain't Mad at
You.''
   A group lindy hop to ``Jumpin' the Blues,'' choreographed by
Swing Society veterans Frank Manning and Norma Miller, was broken up
by four members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Dudley Williams did a solo ``How Long?'' which became a
meditation on anti-black activities. During it, the four Klansmen
melted away. It was obvious that Ailey was just mentioning this, not
doing a deep enough study of it to dent the rollicking good-time
mood of ``Opus McShann.''
   The blues can be a very ebullient music and Ailey has created a
joyous dance.

<HEAD>NATO Determined To Continue Policy Of Adequate Force Size, Arms
Control</HEAD>

   NATO remains determined to continue a
policy it believes has succeeded so far: maintaining adequate
military forces while seeking cuts in conventional and nuclear
forces with the East.
   The foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
ending a two-day meeting Friday, said they welcomed the unilateral
offer by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to cut Soviet forces
by 500,000 troops, or nearly 10 percent, over the next two years.
   ``Promising prospects are opening up for an improved East-West
dialogue,'' they said in a statement.
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other delegates said
the West should not overreact to Gorbachev's decision to withdraw
50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks from Eastern Europe, notably East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   ``Being encouraged doesn't mean that you just go bananas and
forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the
things that are constructive,'' Shultz told reporters.
   He said that after the Soviet troop cuts, the Warsaw Pact still
will have an enormous advantage in battle tanks, artillery and other
armaments.
   The cuts ``will be significant and make a difference,'' Shultz
said. ``But they leave a situation still very assymmetrical.''
   He said the Warsaw Pact's edge in divisions would be reduced to
2.91-to-1 from 2.99, in tanks to 2.18-to-1 from 2.76, and in
artillery to 1.74-to-1 from 2.30.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said, ``We look upon Mr.
Gorbachev with sympathy and encourage his reform efforts.''
   But he said NATO must keep its defenses strong and modernize
weapons even while negotiating cutbacks in conventional forces in
Europe with the Warsaw Pact in talks expected to open next month in
Vienna, Austria.
   Soviet forces in Europe, which NATO estimates at 2.2 million,
``still exceed any reasonable defense need,'' the foreign ministers
said in their statement.
   On Thursday, the Western allies gave a broad outline of NATO's
negotiating position at the Conventional Stability Talks with the
Warsaw Pact.
   The talks are to begin once a 35-nation human rights conference
in Vienna ends.
   The allies said they want to reduce the total number of tanks in
the area between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains to
40,000, leaving East and West each with 20,000.
   Under the NATO proposal, the Soviet Union could keep a maximum of
12,000 tanks on the soil of its East European allies, down from
37,000 now.

   U.S.-mediated peace talks on Angola,
suspended Dec. 3 when the South African delegation suddenly left,
will resume Monday, diplomatic sources say.
   The aim is for an agreement between South Africa, Angola and Cuba
that will lead to the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops from Angola and independence for the territory of South-West
Africa, Angola's southern neighbor.
   After the talks broke off, the Cuban and Angolan delegations
accused South Africa of negotiating in bad faith and charged
Pretoria with foiling a possible peace accord.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said his delegation had
to go home to consult its government on verification of the Cuban
withdrawal.
   South Africa has tied the Cuban withdrawal to independence for
South-West Africa, also called Namibia, on grounds the Cubans would
be a threat to an independent Namibia.

   A blowtorch of dry Santa Ana wind and blazing
embers destroyed 15 expensive homes and damaged 25 others Friday in
a roaring 3,000-acre brush fire that chased residents from their
beds for a third day and prompted the governor to declare a state of
emergency.
   The firestorm, driven by erratic gusts of up to 70 mph blasting
off the desert, hit the northwestern San Fernando Valley. It added
new losses to the 22 homes burned and many others damaged Wednesday
and Thursday, when the wind toppled trucks and knocked out power to
half a million customers.
   Late Friday afternoon, Gov. George Deukmejian issued a terse
order declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles County. The
order makes people eligible to apply for aid under some state
programs and is a first step toward seeking federal aid.
   By nightfall Friday, the winds had eased somewhat, and most of
the thousands who had fled returned to their homes. During the day,
schools were closed and evacuation centers were set up at campuses
and a synagogue.
   No serious injuries were reported, but 45 firefighters suffered
minor eye injuries from flying embers, and five firefighters and two
civilians were treated for smoke inhalation, city fire spokesman Jim
Williamson said.
   ``We still face a very dangerous situation,'' Fire Chief Donald
O. Manning said as the fire eluded control at midafternoon in
non-residential lands close to other residential areas. ``We're not
out of the woods yet.''
   But by nightfall, the winds had begun to slack and the fire began
to calm. The National Weather Service predicted continuing weakening
winds, slowing to 10 mph to 15 mph by Saturday afternoon.
   The fire was 50 percent surrounded by 8 p.m. as it continued to
spread slowly northward into vacant hills, and full containment
expected by sunrise, said county fire spokesman John Lenihan.
   Fourteen houses and a mobile home were destroyed and 25 hours
were damaged Friday, said Fire Department spokesman Gary Svider,
putting the loss at $4.3 million. Earlier, officials had said 22
homes were destroyed or damaged, but a closer look at the burned
area resulted in the higher estimate.
   The fire raced from Sunshine Canyon through the Santa Susana
Mountains 25 miles northwest of downtown and down into the
fashionable Porter Ranch development, said county fire spokesman
John Lenihan.
   Helicopters braved fierce turbulence that made it difficult to
make water drops accurate, while vans carried ground crews up to the
battle. Fire trucks stood guard around an oilfield.
   Two firefighters were hospitalized for embers in their eyes, two
suffered from inhaling fumes of chlorine from burning pool supplies,
and 30 firefighters and one civilian suffered smoke inhalation,
Manning said.
   Seventy horses were evacuated to Granada Hills High School.
   The fire was reported about 4:30 a.m. by employees at the
Sunshine Canyon landfill above Granada Hills and an arson
investigation team searched for clues to the cause, said Battalion
Chief Dean Cathey.
   The fire swept southwest in a blizzard of embers to Porter Ranch,
where residents awakened to choking smoke and an orange glow in the
sky.
   ``It was just like raining fire,'' said Tim Dinsmore, 16, who
helped his father wet down the family home before they had to flee
several blocks away. ``As I was spraying water the neighbors' houses
started to burn; that's when I got scared.'' The Dinsmores' home
survived.
   ``Thousands of embers were coming down on us as we left,'' said
Hank Piorek, who fled the neighborhood with his family of four.
   The relative humidity fell to 15 percent, compared with a normal
60 percent in the early morning, the National Weather Service said,
and that combined with the wind and thick, dry brush to create an
explosive situation. ``Pound for pound, it's equivalent to
gasoline,'' Cathey said.
   Smoke streamed across the wind-swept sky as far as the Pacific
Ocean, 20 miles to the west.
   The chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Ed
Edelman, asked Gov. George Deukmejian to declare an emergency in the
county so that fire victims can seek low interest loans to rebuild
homes and businesses.
   Elsewhere, wind fanned a 200-acre brush fire that broke out north
of Lake Elsinore, southeast of Los Angeles in rural Riverside
County, said state forestry spokeswoman Joanne Evans. Six aircraft
fought the flames in rugged terrain.
   The Dinsmores returned to find that they lost only a wooden
fence, while neighboring homes were destroyed.
   ``You should protect your property,'' said the elder Dinsmore.
``You should help the firemen. They take care of the big stuff, you
take care of the small stuff.''
   Mindy Piorek, 16, was shaken by the early morning evacuation.
   ``The garage was full of smoke, the cats were going crazy, I was
scared,'' she said.
   The Santa Anas are caused by the flow of air from high pressure
over the Western interior to low pressure offshore. Masses of air
pick up speed and warmth when they hurtle down from the desert,
squeezing through mountain passes into the Los Angeles Basin.
   Otherwise ordinary fires can be turned into firestorms that
hopscotch rapidly through brushland and residential areas.
   This blast of the Santa Ana wind began Wednesday, toppling
buildings under construction and overturning tractor-trailer trucks
on highways.
   Early Thursday, the suburbs of Baldwin Park and La Verne, east of
Los Angeles, were hit by fires ignited by downed power lines. At
least 22 homes were lost and 12 others were damaged, along with five
businesses. No serious injuries were reported but damage was
estimated at $10 million.
   Power outages hit about 500,000 people Wednesday night and
Thursday in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
Counties. Rose Parade floats being built in Azusa were damaged when
a huge tent blew down.

<HEAD>Banking Industry Doesn't Expect Revamping Of Laws Until 1990</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee under a new
chairman likely won't act on legislation revamping the nation's
banking laws before 1990, some industry representatives say.
   ``All signals are slow,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice
president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which
is opposed to such legislation.
   The new House Banking Committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, said Friday that the issue of whether to permit greater
overlap of the banking and securities industries ``clearly ... must
be on the priority list.''
   Gonzalez added, however, at his first news conference since being
selected chairman Tuesday that he planned an extensive series of new
hearings on the subject and said the panel would start fresh in its
effort to write legislation.
   The committee, under outgoing chairman Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, D-R.I., who lost his bid for re-election, started hearings
on bank deregulation last year. After a jurisdictional dispute with
the House Energy and Commerce Committee blocked the banking panel's
bill late in this year's session, St Germain pledged to re-pass it
``before the snow melts'' next spring.
   Gonzalez seems in no hurry to complete work on this legislation.
   ``You have to exercise as much or more care when you deregulate
as when you regulated,'' and ``fast legislation is dangerous
legislation,'' he said.
   Gonzalez has made the savings and loan crisis the committee's
first task and that, at best, will be resolved by August, Guenther
said. Then, if the Bush administration makes banking reform a
priority, it could become a focus of Congress in 1990, he said.
   Also, the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., is seen as more sympathetic to the
concerns of the securities industry than his predecessor, Sen.
William Proxmire, D-Wis., Guenther said.
   Robert Dugger, chief economist of the American Bankers
Association, which has pushed for additional bank powers, said the
S&L crisis is so compelling that Congress likely will deal with it
quickly.
   Although Gonzalez in the past has been skeptical of bank
deregulation, other members of the House committee are strong
advocates, he said, adding that a proposed series of regional
hearings on the issue need not delay action unduly.
   Gonzalez told reporters he intends to take testimony in January
on the nation's economy in preparation for writing new legislation.
Then, he said he wants the committee to hold hearings in each of the
12 Federal Reserve Bank districts around the nation to gather the
views of ``little bankers'' and ``citizens.''
   ``We want to hear from those voices who don't have a chance to be
heard in these great halls,'' he said. ``We have not had
comprehensive testimony other than from the lobbies.''
   On other topics, Gonzalez said:
   _The Federal Reserve Board, which operates independently of money
appropriated by Congress, should be held more accountable for the
power it wields over the nation's economy. Gonzalez is a long-time
critic of the Fed. He's advocated subjecting it to auditing by
Congress' General Accounting Office. In the early 1980s when the
board was fighting inflation with high interest rates, he called for
impeachment of the Fed chairman.
   _Industry proposals for resolving the savings and loan crisis are
``Santa Claus wish lists.'' Gonzalez, along with the S&L industry,
advocates tapping the Treasury to clean up insolvent S&Ls. However,
he proposes splitting off the industry's regulator, the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, from the fund that insures its deposits. The
largest S&L trade group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, is
seeking to preserve the current regulatory structure.
   _The accumulation of corporate debt from leveraged buyouts is a
matter of ``great concern.'' But he offered no remedies.

   A man who calls himself ``Black Santa''
is quitting after 26 years of helping the needy despite pleas from
the mayor, the governor and others that he reconsider.
   Robert ``Say'' McIntosh, said he feels exhausted, unappreciated
and dismayed by the growing influence of drugs and a disappearing
work ethic among children and their parents.
   ``I'm just disgusted with the whole thing. I don't have the
cheerful mind to be Santa Claus this year,'' the 44-year-old
restaurateur said Friday.
   His announcement prompted pleas that he change his mind.
   ``It's really too bad,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton. ``Say has done a
lot for several years and I hope he'll be back soon.''
   The governor has been an object of both praise and protests from
McIntosh, known for his free feasts for the poor and leaflets
expounding on a range of subjects.
   ``People will tell him he just can't give up,'' said Mayor Lottie
Shackelford. ``We don't have enough people who are committed as it
is. I just hope he will reconsider. I just know he will.''
   ``We do love him and we care,'' said Dennis Hamilton, director of
missions for the Union Rescue Mission in Little Rock. ``I think he's
made a bigger impact on people than he possibly can understand.''
   McIntosh wasn't swayed.
   ``I'm not going to change my mind,'' he said. ``I'm not thinking
happy this year. I don't deserve to be Black Santa.''
   McIntosh said he reshaped the image of Santa Claus for many black
youngsters who have always seen Santa depicted as a plump, bearded
white man. ``If you're wearing that red suit, you're Santa Claus,''
he said.
   McIntosh said that while giving to others, he has taken a lot
from himself.
   He started playing Santa in 1962 by buying $250 in presents for
poor kids. He estimated that over the years he has spent more than
$250,000 on Christmas gifts and free food. No donor has kicked in
more than about $1,000, and the balance comes from his pocket, he
said.
   ``It just ain't right,'' McIntosh said. ``I keep on borrowing
money to motivate people, motivate this community, help us love each
other. But work ethics is dead in America. We have lost to drugs.
They have destroyed America.''
   His attitude changed with his son's imprisonment last year for
possession of cocaine. McIntosh said he became embittered when few
people offered encouragement during his son's costly defense.
   He said he would still feed the needy for free at his barbecue
restaurant downtown, though he's not planning the full-fledged
dinners he's staged in the past.
   What would persuade McIntosh to put on his custom-made Santa
outfit again?
   ``If I woke up in the morning and there are no drugs and no
people on drugs. If we came together as a community and cleaned up
our community. But that ain't going to happen.''

<HEAD>Report: Soviets Believe They Could Win European War With Fewer
Troops</HEAD>

   Even with Soviet troop reductions announced
this week, the Soviet Union believes it could win a war in Europe
against NATO, according to a congressional report.
   For that reason, the report said, the United States and its North
Atlantic Treaty Organization colleagues should be careful about
Soviet attempts to bargain for lower levels of troops.
   The study did not specifically mention the 10 percent troop
reductions announced at the United Nations this week by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Some of the cuts will affect troops and
equipment in Eastern Europe.
   The report, released Friday, was written by the General
Accounting Office, the Office of Technology Assessment and the
Congressional Research Service. It was ordered by last year's
Pentagon budget bill, which directed a wide-ranging study of the
military balance between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.
   There were four warnings about Soviet intentions in the
long-stalled effort to negotiate lower levels of troops and military
power in the European theater.
   _``First, because the Soviets do not believe that they must have
superiority across the theater in order to achieve victory, caution
must be exhibited in any agreement for force reductions.''
   The Soviets now have an edge of at least a 2-to-1 advantage in
many major measures of military might, the study said, adding,
``Soviet writings suggest that the Soviets could have a force
advantage across the theater of as little as 1.25 to 1 _ or even
parity _ and still achieve victory.''
   _``Any overall symmetrical reduction in forces would not be to
NATO's advantage, given that lowering the density of forces, by
Soviet calculations, would aid the attacker and make rapid advance
and maneuvers easier.''
   _``Unless all equipment is disabled or destroyed, the Soviets
could agree to force reductions, knowing that a dramatically reduced
division would be capable of regeneration in a few weeks.''
   _``Finally, NATO should not expect any significant unilateral
reductions on the part of the Soviets _ either to promote good will
or to pressure NATO into an equivalent response _ that would not
also be in the Soviet Union's own military and political interests.''
   Currently, ``Soviet planners believe that they have a marginal
advantage in the conventional balance in Europe today, although they
are far less optimistic about the future.''
   The Soviets apparently have concluded that a 1.5-to-1 force
advantage or even parity across the entire theater may be sufficient
to enable their forces to achieve a 3- or 4-to-1 force advantage on
a few breakthrough sectors and 4- to 8-to-1 advantage at the
tactical point of penetration, the study said.
   The study was prepared by a variety of experts, including
Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, head of the GAO; former arms
negotiator Jonathan Dean; Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of
the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee; Lawrence Korb,
former assistant secretary of defense; and James Woolsey, former
undersecretary of the Navy.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Accuse North of Repeated Lying To Government Officials</HEAD>

   Oliver L. North repeatedly lied to government
officials ``to cover his tracks'' when confronted with complaints
that Iran was overcharged for U.S. weapons during arms-for-hostage
deals, prosecutors say.
   ``North persisted in a pattern of deception that enabled him to
exploit the Iran initiative by secretly using it to generate a pool
of funds over which he exercised control without governmental
accountability,'' prosecutors said in a filing Friday.
   The former National Security Council aide initially lied to a
Defense Department officer and two CIA officials about the price
Iranian arms dealer Manuchar Ghorbanifar agreed on for 1,000 TOW
missiles in January 1986, the filing said.
   North made the ``critical misrepresentation'' during his report
of the London meeting _ at which Ghorbanifar agreed to pay $10
million, or $10,000 a missile.
   He told three officials that the Iranian had agreed to pay $6,000
apiece for a total of only $6 million, independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh said in the filing.
   North pressed the CIA to reduce the $6,000 price even further and
eventually it was set at $3,700 per missile ``for reasons unrelated
to North's statements,'' Walsh said.
   The arms deals continued that year but by the summer of 1986
``fissures began to develop in North's scheme'' when Iranians
learned they were being overcharged as much as 600 percent. The
discovery was apparently made when they obtained an accurate
microfiche price list for Hawk missile parts, Walsh said.
   North told CIA officer Charles Allen ``to tell the Iranians that
the price they had paid was correct and that it was higher than the
microfiche because it was difficult to locate Hawk spare parts,''
Walsh said.
   He later tried to persuade the CIA to produce a fake price list
``to extinguish the complaints.''
   Confronted by Allen with Ghorbanifar's complaints that he was
being unfairly blamed for the overcharges, North questioned ``the
trustworthiness of Ghorbanifar.''
   ``North repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin of the
inflated prices _ his own efforts to generate a surplus for the
Contras. Instead, he attempted to cover his tracks and blame the
problem on Ghorbanifar,'' Walsh said.
   In the memo filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,
Walsh said he ``will demonstrate at trial that North played a
significant role in directing expenditures from the enterprise
through witnesses such as Willard Zucker,'' an American lawyer who
operates a Swiss financial company.
   According to the filing, Allen is also prepared to testify that
North impugned the trustworthiness of Roy Furmark when told that the
Canadian businessman had ``conveyed Ghorbanifar's suspicion that
funds had been diverted to Central America.''
   Walsh also disclosed that North arranged to purchase ``a
substantial quantity of weapons'' for the Nicaraguan rebels, known
as Contras, with money left over from the aborted sale of Hawk
missiles by Israel to Iran in November 1985.
   By this time, North and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord, a co-defendant in the case, had already started to set up a
clandestine arms-supply network for the Contras, an effort that
Walsh says amounted to a ``secret war'' in Nicaragua.
   Walsh's filing indicated prosecutors have evidence that
contradicts North's congressional testimony last year that the
diversion was suggested by Ghorbanifar during their Jan. 22, 1986,
meeting.
   In the fall of 1985, North directed Israel to place $1 million in
a Swiss bank account to cover the expenses Secord would incur by
selling the 80 Hawk missiles to Iran via Israel. The deal fell
through after the first shipment of 18 Hawks because Iran was
dissatisfied with the weapons it received.
   ``Much less than the full $1 million... was necessary to cover
Secord's expenses,'' Walsh said. ``Aided by this infusion, in
December 1985, the enterprise shipped a substantial quantity of
weapons to the Contras.''
   North and Secord are charged along with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim with
diverting more than $14 million in profits from a series of
U.S.-Iran arms deals in 1986 to the help arm the Contras.
   Gesell has said he hopes to bring North's case to trial by late
January at the earliest.
   Secord, Poindexter and Hakim are to be tried separately after
North.

<TEXT>
   Chadian troops battled with rebels based in
neighboring Sudan, and the clash left 92 rebels and eight government
soldiers dead, according to Chad's foreign ministry.
   In a statement from Paris, the ministry said the skirmish near
Deguessa in eastern Chad was ``particularly violent.'' It said
Chadian troops in Thursday's action captured 15 trucks, mortars,
arms and ammunition.
   After years of fighting with Libyan troops and Libyan-backed
rebels, Chad agreed to a cease-fire last year with its northern
neighbor. The two countries recently renewed diplomatic relations
and exchanged ambassadors.
   But the Chadian statement was harshly critical of Sudan, which
shares a long border with this impoverished central African country.
   ``Hostile activities directed against Chad are prepared and
operate from the Sudanese province of Darfour, with the consent of
senior leaders in (Sudan's capital) Khartoum,'' it said.
   ``Chad condemns this unfriendly and bellicose attitude of the
Sudanese government.''

   Incoming White House chief-of-staff John Sununu
says a thorough background check is delaying the naming of
President-elect Bush's defense secretary.
   Amid reports that an FBI check of top contender John Tower's
personal life is slowing down the process, supporters of the Texas
Republican said the delay could scar Tower politically.
   ``You always wish things could go faster,'' Sununu said Friday.
``And yet, in today's world, the worst thing you could do is to do
things quickly rather than thoroughly and that applies to all
appointments, not just the Tower one.''
   ``You don't get any extra credit for being early,'' the New
Hampshire governor said.
   Bush has yet to confirm widespread reports that Tower, who was an
arms negotiator for President Reagan and a former chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, is his choice.
   However, a Bush transition source, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Friday that Tower still appears to be Bush's first
choice.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a backer of Tower and adviser to Bush
on defense, indicated that a longer-than-anticipated FBI check was
stalling a final announcement. ``They (FBI) are checking allegations
and rumors _ womanizing, drinking involvement in defense
contracts,'' McCain said.
   ``All allegations have to be put to rest so there is no
embarrassment at a later date,'' he said in an interview. ``From
their viewpoint I wouldn't do anything different. It's just sad that
it's harming John Tower to some degree.''
   Sununu would not comment on the reason for the delay. But the
transition source confirmed it was primarily due to an FBI check
believed to be delving into the former Texas senator's personal life
and allegations made by his ex-wife.
   Bush on Friday continued meetings with various interest groups
and individuals. Benjamin Hooks, the head of the NAACP, said after a
private session with the vice president that Bush had promised to
put a black in his Cabinet.
   None of Bush's appointments yet has been a black. Hooks, who met
with the vice president for about 30 minutes, said the session was
``very cordial.''
   The vice president also met with a group of 13 prominent
conservatives. Edwin Feulner Jr., president of the Heritage
Foundation, said the group pressed Bush to ``make sure that all
parts of the (conservative) coalition continue to have a stake in
his success once he becomes president.''
   As for Tower, McCain expressed concern about the delay, saying,
``The longer it takes, there's bound to be an impact on his
stature.''
   Another supporter, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said, ``I think
anyone who is allowed to hang out as the designated nominee without
any confirmation from the president-elect is bound to suffer a
thousand wounds.''
   Bush said this week he was ``disinclined to believe'' negative
allegations about Tower.
   A leading Democrat on defense issues echoed the sentiments of
Republicans McCain and Cohen.
   In a speech, House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
said: ``If Tower is named defense secretary, he will come into
office in a weakened position. ... For one thing, with all that
twisting in the wind, questions will be raised about how much
confidence the president has in him.''
   On other subjects, Sununu said:
   _He wants to be chief of staff ``for eight years with this
president'' and has no plans of returning to New Hampshire in two
years to run for office, although he is holding onto leftover
campaign funds for a possible future race.
   _Direct access to the Oval Office will be given to the chief of
staff, the deputy chief of staff and the national security adviser.
As for Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, Sununu said, ``They (Bush
and Quayle) are going to work out their arrangement, and obviously
whatever the vice president (Bush) decides is the way to work will
be the way we work.''
   _That, as reported, Bush adviser Robert Teeter had been offered
the post of deputy chief of staff and counselor to the president,
and was taking a few days to think it over.
   Teeter said in a telephone interview from his home in Ann Arbor,
Mich., that he would decide ``in the next few days'' whether to take
the job or return to Michigan to resume running his polling service.
``I don't know what I'm going to do yet,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy
Commission, said Bush transition officials have spoken to him about
the posts of energy secretary and Environmental Protection Agency
administrator.
   ``I told them to make me an offer and we'll talk about it,'' he
said.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
remained hospitalized after suffering congestive heart failure,
which aides said was triggered by concern for his exiled daughter.
   Marcos, 71, did not suffer a heart attack and did not require
surgery, doctors said, refusing to release other details until test
results were released later today.
   Marcos was in guarded condition late Friday after undergoing
tests, including an electrocardiogram, said St. Francis Medical
Center spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   He was expected to remain in the hospital's heart unit for about
two days, said Kop. She said he was in good spirits and that his
wife, Imelda, was receiving visitors in an adjoining room.
   Asked to comment on allegations that Marcos, who was deposed as
Philippine president in 1986 and is under indictment in the United
States, had earlier faked symptoms of illness, Kop replied, ``He had
a heart irregularity, and that can be pretty serious.''
   He was taken by ambulance to the hospital and admitted on the
recommendation of his cardiologist, Calvin Wong, due to ``the acute
onset of congestive heart failure'' early Friday, Marcos spokesman
Gemmo Trinidad said.
   Congestive heart failure means the heart is unable to pump the
amount of blood required by the body.
   ``Mrs. Marcos is very worried,'' Trinidad said. ``She's in tears;
she's always in tears.''
   Mrs. Marcos rode to the hospital in the ambulance. She clutched a
brown rosary and cried as Marcos was wheeled into the emergency room
on a stretcher.
   Marcos began having chest pains around 4 a.m., after learning
that his pregnant daughter, Imee Manotoc, who lives in exile in
Morocco, had labor complications and would deliver by Caesarian
section, Trinidad said.
   ``The president became so worried, sick and upset that they
called the doctor,'' Trinidad said.
   Marcos' eldest daughter delivered a boy, her third, but her
condition and that of the baby were not known, Trinidad said.
   Marcos was examined at his Makiki Heights home before being
hospitalized at 12:17 p.m., Trinidad said.
   Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said doctors urged Marcos to seek
treatment for chest pains for the past three weeks, but he did not
want to be hospitalized because he thought critics would accuse him
of faking.
   ``If he thinks he can take the pain, he'll take it.''
   A New York cardiologist who examined Marcos has told a federal
judge in New York that although Marcos suffers various ailments, he
is well enough to travel to New York for arraignment on the
racketeering charges. The arraignment had been postponed after
Marcos' doctors said he was not well enough to travel.
   Marcos repeatedly faked pain during the three-hour examination,
according to the report by the cardiologist, Francis M. Weld.
   The Philippine consul general in Hawaii, Tomas Gomez, said he did
not believe Marcos was sick.
   ``Here we go again, the boy who cried wolf,'' Gomez said. ``With
all the publicity about his faking it. ... I really don't believe
him now.''
   The Marcoses are accused of plundering their homeland and
stashing millions of dollars in the United States. Mrs. Marcos
pleaded innocent on the charges, but Marcos has yet to be arraigned.
   They have lived in Hawaii since his 1986 ouster in a
military-civilian revolt.

<HEAD>Man Who Helped Develop Pacemaker Gets One 30 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who helped develop the first heart
pacemaker reaped the benefit of his toil 30 years later when one of
the devices was implanted in his chest.
   ``It was just the sort of thing that all the work we did a good
number of years ago was all about,'' Norman Roth, 57, said Thursday
in his room at St. Joseph's Hospital. ``All of a sudden, you're on
the other side of the fence.''
   Roth was taken to St. Joseph's on Wednesday with his heart
erratically thumping 10 and 20 beats a minute. For 20 to 30 seconds,
he said, it wouldn't beat at all. He was suffering from
second-degree heart block, a potentially fatal disruption of the
heart's electrical system.
   Cardiologists implanted into Roth's upper chest one of
Medtronic's latest pacemakers, which stimulates both of the heart's
pumping chambers.
   ``I feel fine,'' Roth said. ``Things are coming along nicely.
Once you get the unit in there it stabilizes quickly. All of a
sudden my hands and feet are warm again.''
   In the late 1950s, Roth, then a biomedical engineer, worked with
St. Paul surgeon Samuel Hunter to develop what was called the
Hunter-Roth bipolar electrode. They worked with animals in a
laboratory at St. Joseph's and in a north Minneapolis garage that
was then the center of Medtronic Inc. operations.
   Roth said he has been out of the engineering business for many
years and now works as a financial consultant.
   He said his heart condition was first diagnosed 15 years ago, but
didn't progress until about a year ago. He was planning to arrange
to get a pacemaker implanted when his heart began sputtering
Wednesday.

   Soviet doctors are on the scene and no foreign medical personnel
are needed, said an embassy official, Yevgeny Kutovoi.
   The Soviet government also has established two special bank
accounts to handle contributions. One was at the Dupont Circle
Branch of the Riggs National Bank, 1913 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C., 20036. The name of the account is ``Earthquake
Relief Fund,'' and the number is 04-08-572-564.
   The Soviet Vnesheconbank in Moscow has also established a fund
for wire transfers. That account number is 70-000-412, said Kutovoi.
   Regular telephone lines at the Soviet Embassy are clogged with
calls and officials say they will set up special lines. A number has
not been announced.
   The American Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for
people to call to offer assistance: 1-800-453-9000.

   At a farewell tribute to his 41-year Senate
career, John Stennis heard himself hailed as a giant of political
life and a tower of dedication and integrity.
   But Stennis said the 250 Mississippians gathered in the Senate
Caucus Room to pay him homage at the end of his political career had
come ``not just to honor John Stennis, but to honor a great system
of government _ 200 years of it.''
   Stennis, 87, who is the Senate president pro tem, has been third
in line for the presidency, behind the vice president and the House
speaker, for the last two years. He told the friends who gathered
with him Friday night:
   ``I want to thank those who made it possible for me to withstand
the storms of political life.''
   He said of the American people, ``We are determined, we have the
potential, we have the opportunity and we have the ability to make
this system a success. I'm positive we can make a go of it in this
very difficult system of self government.''
   Stennis is returning to De Kalb, Miss., his hometown, and staff
members said he is likely to devote the rest of his life to trying
to persuade young people to enter public service, perhaps through
teaching.
   At the farewell gathering, the wellwishers who waited to shake
Stennis' hand stood in a line that stretched out the Caucus Room
door into the hallway. They were eager to shake his hand, pat him on
the back and in some cases to offer a hug.
   ``I feel wonderfully well,'' the senator told those who asked.
``This is a stimulus to me. ... I didn't know there would be so many
people.''
   There were many to offer praise and three members of the
Mississippi congressional delegation did it officially.
   Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said, ``John Stennis has served longer and better than
any man in the history of this country.''
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., said, ``There's never been a
blemish on his record and that is very unusual in Washington D.C.''
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said, ``Sen. Stennis made a
difference in the course of history. We are thanking John Stennis
for a remarkable career that has reflected great credit on our
state, on our country and on the United States Senate.''
   The farewell was sponsored by the Mississippi State Society,
comprised of Mississippians who work and live in the Washington area.
   Bill Simpson, a veteran lobbyist in Washington for the state of
Mississippi, introduced Stennis and told the audience: ``You and I
know that the sound of the Stennis trumpet rose above the tumult
true and clear and strong.''
   Stennis ended the evening by reading a letter he said he had
received after his first election to the Senate in l947. Stennis had
been a Mississippi judge before that election and the letter was
from a county constable who had supported him.
   It read: ``I'm sorry you did not get all of the votes in my home
county. You did get them all except for a few old soreheads and some
nutty ones.''
   ``Can you sum up an expression of loyalty any better than that,''
he said.

   Newspaper deliverers are being honored at the
Carrier Hall of Fame with a new proclamation signed by President
Reagan and all 50 governors.
   The last signature on the document was added by the president
aboard Air Force One.
   After traveling from state to state in a mailing tube with a
special pen, the parchment proclamation suffered only a small
wrinkle in the upper right-hand corner, said Joseph Forsee, general
manager of the International Circulation Managers Association in
Reston, Va.
   It honors ``the young men and women who accept the responsibility
of distributing the daily newspaper.'' Forsee said more than 700,000
news carriers deliver morning and afternoon dailies across the
country, with about 70 percent of them children who earn from $20 to
$45 a week.
   Forsee said adult carriers, who tend to have larger routes,
deliver about half the newspapers in the country. Many unpaid
parents also help, he noted.
   Among those honored in the Carrier Hall of Fame are President

<HEAD>FAA Probe Finds Need for Improvements in Commuter Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nine-month surveillance spawned by a rash of
commuter airline accidents that killed 56 people uncovered
``systemic deficiencies'' in management and operation of many
commuter airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration says.
   The FAA said Friday that while its special examination of the
commuter industry found some carriers in full compliance with
federal regulations ``others demonstrated a need for significant
improvements.''
   The special inspections program, which began in March, covered 35
airlines, or about 20 percent of the commuter industry.
   The FAA said its inspections uncovered 1,284 violations of
air-safety regulations, about one-third of which were considered
serious enough to warrant a possible civil penalty.
   Commuter airlines, which generally fly aircraft with 30 or fewer
seats, have become an increasingly important segment of the
commercial airline industry, bringing passengers from smaller
airports to larger airports serviced by major airlines.
   This year commuter airlines are expected to carry more than 32
million people in and out of 800 cities.
   The FAA inspection was prompted early this year by a string of
commuter accidents _ seven in four months during late l987 and early
l988 _ in which 56 people were killed. There have been no fatal
commuter crashes since the review began in March, FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar said.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said he was particularly
concerned about the ``systemic deficiencies with management
personnel'' uncovered by FAA inspectors.
   ``The most serious findings of the inspections reflected a lack
of management knowledge of, and experience with, complex commuter
air carrier regulations as well as substandard administration of
training and deficient aircraft inspection programs,'' McArtor wrote
in a letter to commuter airlines.
   The FAA attributed much of the industry's problems to the ``rapid
growth of the commuter industry and the transition to larger, more
complex aircraft'' unfamiliar to many managers.
   Among the FAA findings were that some airlines failed to fill
management positions or filled them with ``inexperienced or
unqualified people; at times pilots did not complete required
competency checks; training records were incomplete or did not
exist; and aircraft were at times allowed to depart without repairs
being fully performed.''
   The airlines inspected were selected at random, according to FAA
officials. The FAA provided no breakdown as to what was found at
each airline, but did release a list of the air carriers inspected.
   The commuter airline industry, responding to the findings,
acknowledged some shortcomings and attributed many of the problems
to the industry's rapid growth in recent years.
   ``We were aware that the tremendous growth of regional airlines
may have created difficulties for some carriers in filling
operational and maintenance posts,'' said Duane Ekedahl, president
of the Regional Airline Association.
   The industry association said it was forming a special task force
of industry officials to find ways for commuter airlines to retain
experienced pilots and management employees.
   The FAA identified the 35 airlines as:
   40 Mile Air Ltd; Air Midwest Inc.; Air Molokai; Air Nevada
Airlines; Air New Orleans Inc.; Alpha Aviation Inc.; Atlantic
Southeast Airlines Inc.; Aviation Associates Inc.; Bering Air Inc.;
   Business Express, Inc.; Capitol Air Service Inc.; CCAir Inc.;
Channel Flying Inc.; East Coast Airways; Eastern Metro Express;
Executive Air Charter; Friendship Air Alaska Inc.; Fischer Brothers;
Great Lakes Aviation Ltd; Henson Aviation Inc.; HUB Express Inc.;
   Jetstream International Airlines; Michigan Airways Inc.;

   The remains of three U.S. servicemen
killed in a helicopter crash in Honduras arrived at an American
military base in Panama and will be sent home after autopsies are
performed, officials said.
   A statement late Friday by the U.S. Southern Command said rescue
workers were searching for the bodies of two more servicemen, killed
Thursday when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed near La Ceiba,
in northern Honduras.
   Charles Barclay, spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Honduras,
identified the dead as 1st Lt. Alan C. Urban, Staff Sgt. John P.
McConnell, and Pfcs. Jim D. Bendon and Douglas J. Kropp, all based
at Fort Bragg, N.C.; and Chief Warrant Officer Randall B. Potter of
Fort Stewart, Ga.
   He did not release their hometowns.
   A team of investigators from the Army Aviation Center in Fort
Rucker, Ala., arrived in Honduras on Friday to seek clues in to the
cause of the crash, Barclay said.
   The Chinook was based at Palmerola Air Base. Barclay said it had
left Palmerola earlier Thursday on a supply run in joint
U.S.-Honduran military maneuvers.
   It was the second fatal crash this year of a twin-rotor Boeing
Chinook. On Feb. 25, an Army Chinook crashed near Chico, Texas,
killing 10 soldiers.
   At least 30 American troops in Honduras have been killed or
wounded in accidents or incidents of violence since the United
States began a series of exercises there in 1982.
   About 1,500 American troops are in Honduras, including 1,100
permanently stationed at Palmerola.

<HEAD>IRS Investigates Television Evangelists' Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some television evangelists' financial records
are being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, and two of
the probes are criminal in nature, the agency said.
   The IRS is looking at the records to determine if there was
misuse of tax-exempt contributions, Ellen Murphy, IRS director of
public affairs, said Friday.
   Ms. Murphy did not identify those being investigated, saying the
law prohibits such disclosure.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that the Rev.
Jerry Falwell had been notified that the IRS will begin a review
next month of Falwell's Liberty University and may later look into
his television show, the Old Time Gospel Hour.
   The Post also reported that spokeswomen for evangelists Pat
Robertson and Oral Roberts had confirmed the IRS was auditing their
operations. Both organizations said they had not received word on
results of the investigations.
   The Post said the IRS is looking into whether Robertson used
millions of dollars from his Christian Broadcasting Network to help
finance his bid for the presidency. That probe reportedly is
completed, but CBN spokesman Frankie Abourjilie said another inquiry
was under way into the operation of the tax-exempt CBN network, the
Post said.
   Former PTL host Jim Bakker, who was indicted this week on wire
and mail fraud charges, is part of the IRS investigation, according
to sources quoted by the Post.
   Ms. Murphy said the IRS routinely examines records of tax-exempt
organizations. The investigations into various television evangelist
ministries are in various stages and do not reflect any decision to
take a major look at evangelists, she said.
   Assistant IRS Commissioner Robert I. Brauer wrote to Rep. J.J.
Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of a Ways and Means oversight
subcommittee, that at least six probes involved television
evangelists and two were criminal investigations, Ms. Murphy said.
   The letter said the IRS was examining whether contributions to
the ministries were diverted for personal use but were not reported
as income, whether salaries and benefits received by evangelists
were higher than that considered reasonable for tax-exempt
organizations, and whether donations were illegally channeled into
political activities, the Post said.
   Ms. Murphy said such investigations could lead to criminal
charges or to an IRS bid to revoke an organization's tax-exempt
status. However, she also said the IRS generally tries to get an
organization to make internal changes to allow it to keep its
tax-exempt status, and such a move might not be made public.
   A Falwell spokesman said his organizations had been audited twice
before and the IRS ``found our books to be in good shape.'' Falwell
welcomed the audit, the Post quoted the spokesman as saying.

   Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of
emergency in Los Angeles County, where flames fanned by Santa Ana
``devil winds'' destroyed at least 37 homes and blackened more than
3,350 acres.
   ``It was hitting so fast I thought my hair would catch fire, my
clothing would catch fire,'' said Jane Cody, 41, whose house escaped
damage from a wildfire that gutted 15 homes in the fashionable
suburb of Porter Ranch Friday as winds gusted to 70 mph on the
brushy hillside.
   ``All you could see was red. All you could feel was wind.''
   Santa Ana winds calmed today, and firefighters had the blaze more
than half surrounded.
   The fire that burned more than 3,200 acres in the northwest San
Fernando Valley was the third to ravage Southern California in two
days. Two wind-fanned blazes Thursday burned 150 acres and destroyed
22 homes in the suburbs of La Verne and Baldwin Park.
   By nightfall Friday, the winds relented and the fire slowed. The
National Weather Service predicted winds would slow to 10 to 15 mph.
   The fire, located in the Granada Hills area 25 miles northwest of
downtown, was 60 percent surrounded Friday night as it spread slowly
northward into vacant hills, said county fire spokesman John
Lenihan. Full containment was expected today.
   Deukmejian issued the emergency declaration Friday afternoon,
enabling victims to apply for state aid. The order would also make a
federal disaster declaration possible, but it was not known if one
had been requested.
   The San Fernando fire destroyed 14 houses and a mobile home, and
damaged 25 houses, said fire spokesman Gary Svider. Damage was
estimated at $4.3 million.
   Forty-five firefighters suffered minor eye injuries from flying
embers, and five firefighters and two civilians were treated for
smoke inhalation, said city fire spokesman Jim Williamson.
   The blaze began early Friday in Sunshine Canyon, then swept
southwest in a blizzard of embers through the Santa Susana Mountains
to Porter Ranch, where homes cost up to $500,000.
   Residents awakened to choking smoke and an orange glow in the
sky. Thousands fled their homes, but others stayed behind as long as
they could.
   ``It was just like raining fire,'' said Tim Dinsmore, 16, who
helped his father wet down the family home before they were forced
to flee several blocks. The home was unscathed.
   Fire officials wanted to question two men seen in the area in the
hope they might provide clues on how the fire began, Williamson
said. ``They are not suspects,'' he stressed.
   Fire investigators photographed downed power lines at the
Sunshine Canyon Landfill, where the fire was first reported, said
landfill spokesman Mark Ryavec.
   At the height of the blaze, eight water-dropping helicopters
dived on the flames as 1,200 firefighters attacked on the ground and
fire trucks guarded an oilfield installation.
   Seventy horses from stables in the fire area were evacuated to
Granada Hills High School, and classes were dismissed at many area
schools.
   ``This is a tragedy, but when you think about it, it could have
been much worse,'' Mayor Tom Bradley told reporters during a tour of
burned areas. ``We are pleased with the expertise that was
demonstrated here.''
   Elsewhere, firefighters contained at midnight a 1,000-acre brush
fire that broke out late Friday morning north of Lake Elsinore in
rural Riverside County, state forestry officials said. The fire was
expected to be under control by this afternoon, said foresty Capt.
Mike Sowards.
   The fire, which came within a couple hundred yards of four homes,
was believed to have started accidentally, but its exact origin was
unknown, said Battalion Chief Ted Pfeiffer.
   The Santa Anas, which picked up strength in the area Wednesday,
are caused by the flow of air from high pressure over the Western
interior to low pressure offshore, picking up speed and warmth as
they hurtle down from the desert through mountain passes into the
Los Angeles Basin.

   More than 3,000 troops braved
Arctic weather to practice assault tactics designed for potential
attacks on Soviet positions, an exercise that also provided the
first test of the Pentagon's emergency media pool in such conditions.
   Three platoons of the 6th Light Infantry Division from nearby
Fort Greely took part in the maneuvers, 1,200 combat infantrymen and
1,900 support troops. Friday was the 11th day of a 15-day test of
men and equipment in temperatures that have plunged to 44 degrees
below zero. Winds at times have reached 70 mph, according to a media
pool report filed from the scene.
   ``This is probably the most physically demanding field troop
exercise the Army's ever put together,'' said Col. Jim Wood,
commander of the division's 2nd Brigade. Because of the winds,
helicopter maneuvers and air jumps were canceled.
   The conditions also were blamed for other problems, including
rifle jams attributed to exposure to bitter cold after being stored
in stove-warmed tents. Fort Greely, 100 miles southeast of
Fairbanks, is about an hour by plane from the Soviet Union.
   A small group of reporters was notified by the Pentagon just
after midnight Thursday and flown to Alaska from Washington. The
secret operation, a test of Pentagon procedures for bringing media
to combat areas in the event of hostilities involving U.S. troops,
was not disclosed until Friday afternoon.
   The pool arrangement was established following media complaints
after reporters were excluded from covering the U.S. invasion of
Grenada in 1983.
   The reporters were given a quick course in Arctic survival by
Army experts and provided with clothing and other equipment designed
for the frigid environment.
   The exercises are an annual event for the 2nd Brigade, the
northernmost U.S. combat troops in the world. Friday's activities
included live-fire assault accompanied by Air Force and Army
artillery barrages. The troops, provided with snowshoes and skis to
make their way through the fields, dug foxholes in waist-deep snow
banks and spent the night in the field.

   Americans swiftly mobilized to send money, food, clothing,
medical supplies and rescue dogs halfway around the world to
earthquake-shattered Soviet Armenia. One governor even offered to
send his state's National Guard.
   ``I just cannot believe the response we are getting,'' Sonia
Tanielian of the Armenian Church of Seattle said Friday.
   A government-chartered jetliner filled with medical supplies and
canine search teams left for the Soviet Union early today after
Soviet officials announced they welcomed U.S. assistance. It was the
first such large-scale effort since World War II's Lend Lease
program.
   In Miami, an international arms dealer said he was loading three
planes with relief supplies. And a New England group was looking for
a plane to carry the goods it's collecting.
   Relief efforts were being mounted not only by relief
organizations such as the American Red Cross and American-Armenian
groups, but by individuals touched by the tragedy in the
southwestern Soviet Republic of Armenia.
   Two businessmen in Muncie, Ind., arranged for a clothing drop and
a bank account for donations.
   ``It might mean more to the earthquake victims that people who
don't have direct contact with them are willing to do this,'' said
marketing executive P.J. Marshall.
   A New Hampshire man of Armenian descent began collecting
donations Friday, urging people to forgo a Christmas gift this year
and send the money to the earthquake victims.
   ``It's hard, certainly for me, to look forward to Christmas in
any way this year knowing what's happening over there,'' said Abe
Dadian, of Laconia, whose parents emigrated from Armenia.
   The Soviet Embassy in Washington said it has been overwhelmed
with telephone calls and by people who are ``walking up to the doors
of the embassy with checks and money orders.''
   Rhode Island's Gov. Edward DiPrete offered to send his state's
National Guard to Armenia if President Reagan approves. ``It's just
a willingness to help in whatever way possible,'' DiPrete said.
   Cindy Stuart, a spokeswoman for the Agency for International
Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said the U.S.
plane would carry eight trained dogs, handlers, and support
personnel. The dogs will be used to help find survivors in quake
rubble.
   A cargo hangar at Boston's Logan International Airport was being
used as a collection point for donated clothing, blankets and food.
John Megerdichian of the Armenian Assembly of New England in
Watertown, Mass., said the group was looking for a plane to take the
donations to Armenia.
   In Los Angeles, leaders of the largest Armenian community outside
the Soviet Union met Friday to unify relief efforts. About 300,000
people of Armenian descent live in California, mostly in Southern
California.
   ``We are stricken with grief, but at the same time we are
organizing ourselves to be as much help as we can to our kin in
Armenia,'' said Archbishop Datev Sarkissian, prelate for the Western
Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America.
   Los Angeles TV station KSCI planned a telethon between midnight
tonight and 6 a.m. Sunday, to be broadcast throughout Southern
California and in Armenian communities nationwide, officials said.
   Boston-based Oxfam America donated $20,000 for temporary shelter
and medical supplies, its first relief effort in an industrialized
nation and in the Soviet Union, officials said.
   In Miami, Sarkis Soghanalian, owner of Pan-Aviation Inc., said he
was preparing to fly three Boeing 707s loaded with relief supplies
donated by south Florida's community of about 2,000 Armenians.
   Soghanalian, a Lebanese national of Armenian descent who lives in
Miami, faces charges of trying to smuggle 103 combat helicopters to
Iraq.
   In Columbus, Ohio, state Insurance Director George Fabe announced
a drive to raise at least $500,000 for medical aid from insurance
companies.
   ``The role of insurance is to step in when tragedy strikes,''
Fabe said in a statement announcing the plan.
   Pennsylvania's Gov. Robert P. Casey, in telegrams to Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said volunteers from a coalition of
public-service groups were ready to go to Armenia to aid in the
recovery effort.
   At Armenian organizations in New Jersey, phones have been ringing
nearly non-stop with offers of contributions.
   ``We're getting a broad response, not just from Armenians,'' said
Lori Atamian with the 7,000 member Armenian General Benevolent Union
in New Jersey.
   The union's Chicago chapter was also collecting donations.
   ``We've had people just walking in and making donations _ from $3
to $1,000 _ right out of their pockets,'' said chapter official
Peter Klujian.

   It's hard to miss the community Christmas
tree. It rises 30 feet from a manhole in the center of an
intersection downtown.
   Even so, motorists in this town of about 4,200 people about 100
miles south of Chicago have been missing it for 25 years.
   ``I don't remember hearing any major complaints about it becoming
a traffic hazard,'' said Mayor James Kingston. ``We're all kind of
used to it.''
   Officials have anchored the Christmas tree at the same
intersection for at least a quarter of a century, said City Clerk
Millie Schroeder.
   ``We have a tree in the middle of the street every year,'' she
said. ``It's been in the center block I don't know how long.''
   Kingston said there's a good reason for the location.
   ``There's a big manhole right here in the middle of the street,''
he said. ``And, they place the tree in the manhole.''

   The Carlucci family attracted more
attention than it expected, or wanted, by sending relatives a bogus
invitation to a White House dinner.
   The invitations to a recent family reunion were printed with a
fake Defense Department letterhead and the forged signature of
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   The Defense Department learned about the invitations, and the
Secret Service asked local police to investigate, said Maj. Anthony
Ciaccia of the Monroe County Sheriff's Department.
   Sheriff's deputies this week questioned several of the Carluccis,
who insisted the invitations were a prank.
   ``Needless to say, the local Carluccis are mortified and
apologized profusely,'' said Ciaccia. ``All's well that ends well.''
   ``It never occurred to us (that anyone would take it
seriously),'' said Mary Cilento of East Rochester, who helped send
out the invitations. The family held its reunion Nov. 25.
   Family members said they sent a real invitation to the defense
secretary, although they don't know if he is a relative.

   Residents shut themselves in after dark,
drew curtains and answered callers warily as police hunted for a
gunman believed responsible for four shootings in as many nights.
   The first victim was killed outside his auto customizing shop on
Monday. Three men were wounded by shots fired into their homes on
each of the next three nights.
   Police on Friday had patrols closely watching neighborhoods in
this township of 23,000 people on Long Island.
   ``We can only assume that the killer has gotten scared because of
the extra patrols, or else he's taken the night off. We just don't
know,'' Detective Sgt. William Armstrong of the Southampton police
said late Friday.
   The shootings have enough in common to point to one sniper, but
police so far say they haven't found a common thread that would
point to motive.
   All the shootings have occurred after dark, most around dinner
time, within a two-mile radius in the towns of Southampton and
Riverhead. The two towns are about 75 miles east of New York City
and near the exclusive beach communities favored by the city's
wealthy.
   The victims, all blue-collar men in their 30s, were shot with
either a small-caliber rifle or a lightweight shotgun. Friends and
relatives described them all as hard-working family men and were at
a loss to suggest a motive.
   ``It's scary,'' said Barbara Bouchard, who lives next door to one
of the victims. ``This is stuff you hear about in New York City.
Around here, the most serious thing is they catch people
shoplifting.''
   An anonymous caller believed to have been the gunman contacted
Riverhead police after the first shooting Monday and said, ``death
to drug dealers and crooked cops,'' according to a source involved
in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity. A similar
call came after the second shooting on Tuesday, he said.
   But police said none of the victims was known to have dealt drugs
and they apparently did not know one another.
   ``There is a definite link with the four,'' said the source. ``We
think there is a reason for these shootings, a perverted type of
thing.''
   Southhampton police Chief Conrad Teller said the victims appeared
to have been specific targets and not chosen at random.
   But, he said, ``we have nothing concrete to connect them.''

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco USA says it
plans to test market a cigarette in January that gives off less
smoke than other cigarettes.
   The company developed the cigarette because some people find
cigarette smoke offensive, company Executive Vice President Peter
Hoult said recently.
   The low-tar cigarettes, which will be marketed as Vantage Excel
100s, burn and produce ash, unlike Premiere, the company's
``smoke-free'' cigarette that heats, rather than burns, tobacoo.
   Smoke from the cigarette's lit end is reduced by a new tobacco
blend and a special paper, company officials said.
   Hoult said there is no reduction in the smoke coming through the
filter.
   ``Vantage Excel 100s represents the second recent innovation by
our research and development scientists in applying new technology
to respond to social concerns about cigarette smoke, but it differs
significantly from our highly publicized innovation test-marketed
earlier this year,'' he said, referring to Premiere.
   Vantage Excel 100s will be available in Arkansas and parts of
Michigan and Louisiana.

   A pair of lionesses kept in a farmhouse

   Esmerina Scotti, 62, was looking after the animals that belonged

   The retired railway worker was fond of wild animals and had kept
lions for several years.
   But when his sister noticed Friday that the lions were not in
their cage, she telephoned an 18-year-old friend, Marcello Cerutti,
who had a lion of his own, for help.
   One of the lions, hidden behind a car, attacked the woman, then
turned on the young man.
   The lions were later captured by police and firefighters.
   Police said many people in the rural area near Milan raise wild
animals.

   President Reagan and President-elect Bush assured
Mikhail Gorbachev at their meeting this week that they would not try
to undermine his program of economic change in the Soviet Union, The
New York Times reported today.
   During the leaders' luncheon meeting here Wednesday, Gorbachev
expressed concern that some in the West appeared to want his
economic program to fail.
   But the American leaders assured their Soviet counterpart his
fears were unfounded, the Times reported, quoting unidentified
Reagan administration officials.
   The sources said the superpower leaders discussed a number of
other topics, including priorities to set in the expanding arms
control talks, but neither side brought up new proposals.
   Gorbachev's sweeping decision to cut Soviet conventional forces
was not discussed, even though it had been the highlight of his
address only hours before at the United Nations, the sources said.
   The luncheon for top Soviet and American officials followed a
private meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev at which Reagan
reportedly gave Gorbachev a list of human rights cases.
   The earthquake in Soviet Armenia was briefly discussed at the
luncheon before the talk shifted to arms control.

   A team of 26 American disaster relief
specialists left for earthquake-stricken Soviet Armenia early this
morning with a planeload of supplies and eight dogs trained to find
live victims in the rubble.
   ``This is a special opportunity for us to reach out and work with
the Soviet Union,'' said Julia Taft, head of the Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance of the State Department's Agency for
International Development.
   Mrs. Taft was head of a team that included nine doctors, among
them Robert Gale, the Los Angeles physician who helped treat victims
of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union.
   Team members boarded a heavily loaded chartered 727 which lifted
off from Dulles International Airport at 3:30 a.m. EST. It was
scheduled to refuel in Newfoundland and Ireland before completing
the scheduled 13-hour flight to Yerevan, the capital of Soviet
Armenia.
   The team members, most of them veterans of major disaster relief
efforts, expressed little fear of entering an unfamiliar corner of
the world where tens of thousands of people have perished in one of
the worst earthquakes of the century.
   ``I have experience with disasters, experience with Soviet
disasters,'' said Gale, predicting that political complications in
Armenia would be less than those surrounding Chernobyl, which
involved the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor.
   ``I feel pretty confident that we know what we are getting into.
Training is the key to the whole thing,'' said Steve McConaughy, a
member of the canine team along with his wife, Carol. The couple is
from Brookeville, Md., and the pair are going to Armenia with their
black Newfoundland dogs, Ebony and Shasta.
   The American party included Louise Simone, executive vice
president of the Armenian General Benevolent Fund based in Saddle
Brook, N.J., and two doctors affiliated with the charitable society,
Garo Tertzakian and Vartkes Najarian, both of Los Angeles.
   ``For us, this is a long-term prospect to rebuild Armenia,'' said
Mrs. Simone, of New York City. She noted that the nearly 100,000
dead and 700,000 reportedly left homeless made up a large share of
Armenia's population of 3.3 million.
   Her foundation is raising millions of dollars to send medicine
and other relief supplies to Armenia.
   Soviet diplomats met with State Department officials late Friday
afternoon to make arrangements for sending the chartered plane, U.S.
and Russian spokesmen said.
   The operation marks the first large-scale U.S. government
assistance to Soviet Union in the post-World War II era. The two
countries were allies during the war.
   The flight and many members of the team started from New York's
Kennedy airport, and the team added more members and the bulk of the
supplies at the later stop at Dulles.
   The dogs will be used to help find possible survivors in the
rubble left by the massive earthquake, which Soviet authorities
estimated had killed 80,000 people.
   The U.S. government offered to help Thursday but received no
response until late Friday afternoon when Yevgeny Kutovoi,
minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy, met at the State
Department with Mrs. Taft.
   Kutovoi, at a news conference, read a long list of goods, largely
medical supplies, that are urgently needed in Armenia.
   ``We are ready to receive medicines and medical equipment
(syringes, medication, etc.) blood transfusion systems, medical and
other equipment for rebuilding hospitals, outpatient clinics,
kindergartens, nurseries, tents, blankets, clothing,'' he said.
   ``Cargo-carrying planes, including military transport aircraft,
may fly directly to Yerevan,'' he said. ``We are receiving those
donations with gratitude. We did not request it. We received offers
of aid.''
   Kutovoi said Soviet doctors had rushed to the stricken area, and
that foreign medical specialists were not needed immediately.
   The Soviet government has established two special bank accounts
for gifts and special teams of French and British dogs were already
in Yerevan helping search the rubble for survivors, he said.
   One bank account was at the Dupont Circle Branch of the Riggs
National Bank, 1913 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.,
20036. The name of the account is ``Earthquake Relief Fund,'' and
the account number is 04-08-572-564.
   The Soviet Vnesheconbank in Moscow has also established a fund
for wire transfers. That account number is 70-000-412, said Kutovoi.
   The American Red Cross reported that money, antibiotics and kits
used to draw blood are being collected and the Soviet Embassy said
it was deluged with telephone calls.
   ``The phones are ringing constantly as people call to express
their condolences,'' embassy press counselor Igor Bulay said.
``There is a stream of donations. People are walking up to the doors
of the embassy with checks and money orders. Checks are beginning to
come in the mail. A lot of people are calling to ask how to make
donations.''
   The embassy plans to set up a special telephone line to handle
the calls, but has not yet established the number, said Kutovoi.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Terry Gautier said her organization was
making arrangements with major pharmaceutical firms to supply
antibiotics and was collecting money to aid quake victims. Emigre
Armenians are contributing heavily, she said.
   U.S. officials also are collecting ``blood packs'' for shipment
to the Soviet Union, she said.
   The American Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for
people to call to offer assistance. The number is 1-800-453-9000.
Americans also can make donations to local Red Cross chapters,
marked for the Soviet Armenian Earthquake Relief, or through various
Armenian groups.

   The music strikes up at Purdy High School
tonight, but some of the people who won a court battle against this
southern Missouri community's century-old dance ban won't be able to
get footloose.
   Only current students will be permitted to attend the homecoming
dance, disappointing graduates among the 21 students and parents who
sued two years ago to have the dance ban struck down.
   School Superintendent Sheldon Buxton, saying he feared outsiders
bent on disruption would be attracted by publicity about the dance
and dance ban, has restricted attendance to the 160 students
enrolled at Purdy High.
   ``Naturally that upsets me just a little bit, because most of the
people who were really behind it were in my class,'' said Amy Wolf,
who graduated last year.
   Amother graduate, George Fox, said he had planned to go to the
dance before learning administrators had put strict restrictions on
the event.
   ``But I can miss it _ I'm not going to let it upset me,'' Fox
said.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled last summer that the
Purdy School Board's dance ban was unconstitutional, saying it
promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious
reasons.
   The school board appealed Clark's order, but suspended the
no-dance rule pending a ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Louis. The appeals court is not expected to hear the
case until the end of the year.
   Miss Wolf, now a freshman at Missouri Southern State College in
nearby Joplin, recalls the homecoming games and crowning ceremonies
of her high school years _ followed by a 15-minute drive to a nearby
town for a dance. She said she had hoped for at least one dance in
the high school gym before graduating.
   ``I had no idea the court system would have taken so long to get
anything done,'' she said. ``I've learned a lot about the way
government works.''
   Fox's younger sister, Nancy, is student body president at Purdy
this year, and he has several other younger brothers and sisters.
   ``I'm not really sure if I got anything out of it or not,'' Fox
said of the court battle. ``But at least they (his siblings) will
get something out of it.''
   Purdy is a century-old farming community of about 900 people deep
in the Ozarks of southern Missouri and located about midway between
Springfield and Joplin.

<HEAD>Defense Department May Delay Peak Production of Stealth Bombers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is on the verge of
approving a change in funding that could delay peak production of
the B-2 stealth bomber until the mid- and late 1990s, the Los
Angeles Times reported today.
   The decision on the $68.5 billion stealth bomber program should
come Monday, the newspaper said.
   The Times quoted unidentified Pentagon officials who said the
bomber's production schedule ``clearly will be stretched out.''
   The news followed a meeting Wednesday of the Defense Resources
Board, the Pentagon's senior decision-making body for program
management.
   ``We've flattened out production to a more gradual increase than
was planned,'' a Pentagon official told the Times, requesting
anonymity.
   Air Force officials are backing the change in production, saying
it will allow time to incorporate improvements that may be suggested
during flight tests, the newspaper said.
   Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV, who chaired
Wednesday's meeting, was expected to reach a final decision over the
weekend following meetings with department officials, the Times said.
   Production plans call for building 132 of the planes.
   The stealth, a variation of a single-wing aircraft design and
resembling a giant bat, was unveiled last month when the first plane
was rolled out at Northrop Corp.'s production facility in Palmdale.
   The first bombers, costing $500 million each, were to be
delivered to the Air Force in 1991, with planes reportedly being
delivered at a rate of two per month by 1992.
   Production rates, like nearly everything regarding the highly
secret bomber, have been classified, but Taft's decision could push
back peak production two to three years.
   ``That production rate is now unaffordable,'' a defense official
said.
   Some lawmakers had also indicated previously that production
plans might have to be pushed back because of high costs.
   ``We probably are going to have to slow down the stealth ...
considerably,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate defense
panel, said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' on Nov. 27.
   However, such a change could jeopardize the financial stability
of the bomber's prime contractor, Northrop Corp., which derives
about half its sales from the plane.
   The company already has reduced its labor force on the bomber
from a peak of 14,000 to 12,600 employees.
   As word that the bomber's production scale might be stretched out
began to surface on Wall Street last week, Northrop's stock dropped
from $31.875 a share to $29.125 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEAD>Stiff Penalty for `Wall Street Whiz Kid'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old would-be financial adviser who
bilked investors out of $15 million is ``a product of our times,''
says his lawyer, but the judge who gave him an eight-year sentence
called him ``a predator.''
   U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein did not impose a fine
Friday, but ordered David P. Bloom to make full restitution.
Edelstein could have sentenced Bloom to 10 years in prison and $20
million in fines.
   ``For the past few years my life has been out of control,'' Bloom
told the judge before sentencing, adding that he had undergone
extensive psychiatric treatment.
   The high-living Bloom, whose massive swindle scheme earned him
the title ``Wall Street Whiz Kid,'' pleaded guilty last March to one
count each of mail fraud and securities fraud.
   According to prosecutors, the boyish-looking Bloom used deceit
and fraud to parlay a college investment club into a
multimillion-dollar investment operation with about 140 clients,
most of them friends of his parents.
   Bloom, who was not registered as an investment adviser, wooed
investors for his now-defunct Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc. by
falsely claiming his clientele included the Sultan of Brunei, the
Rockefeller family and entertainer Bill Cosby.
   In a sentencing memo to the judge, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert
L. Plotz said Bloom ``victimized close friends of his parents'' and
``betrayed the trust not only of these friends but also of his
parents.''
   Noting that several of Bloom's victims had turned over pension
plans and individual retirement accounts to him, the memo said Bloom
``took everything he could from people who loved him; in so doing,
he exhibited a legal and moral depravity.''
   ``I have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and
betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me,'' Bloom
told the judge.
   Bloom's lawyer urged Edelstein to give his client a shorter
sentence than the three-year term handed Ivan F. Boesky, describing
Bloom as a ``greedy young man and a product of our times.'' Wall
Street speculator Boesky pleaded guilty to securities law conspiracy
and is cooperating with investigators,
   ``When he grew up, greed was on the ascendency,'' said the
lawyer, David W. O'Connor. ``David Bloom shouldn't wind up being the
scapegoat of the 1980s.''
   But Edelstein said Bloom was ``remorseless, completely lacking in
conscience. He was a predator, completely insensitive.''
   The judge sentenced Bloom to four years on each count and, in an
unusual move, ordered the prison terms to run consecutively as
spectators in the crowded courtroom gasped.
   Bloom, a 1985 Duke University graduate with an art history
degree, told clients he was putting their money into the stock
market when he actually was using it to pay for a lavish lifestyle
that included art works worth $5.5 million; an $830,000 condominium
on Manhattan's Upper East Side; a beach house worth $1.9 million on
New York's Long Island; and two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible
and a Mercedes-Benz _ worth $200,000.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission last January brought civil
charges against Bloom, who settled by agreeing to turn over his
assets to a court-appointed receiver and to stay out of the
securities industry for the rest of his life.

   Residents of this little piece of Armenia
waited for news from their earthquake-devastated homeland as they
struggled to deal with the latest calamity to befall their people.
   ``It seems as though we're always being persecuted one way or the
other,'' said Carl Takvorian, 66.
   About 6,000 of Watertown's 39,000 residents are of Armenian
extraction. The tidy middle-class suburb about five miles west of
Boston is believed to have one of the highest concentrations of
Armenians in America.
   On Friday, the day after the quake hit Soviet Armenia, churches
were draped in black bunting, children laid wreaths at a monument,
and charitable organizations geared up to aid victims.
   ``We don't know why we're being punished,'' said retired
policeman Edward Kazanjian, 78.
   Kazanjian was one of dozens of people crowding the office of the
St. James Apostolic Armenian Church community center, awaiting any
news from the disaster area.
   ``The holocaust was bad enough,'' he said, referring to a Turkish
campaign to wipe out Armenians that began in 1894 and reached its
peak during World War I. Hundreds of thousands died, and many others
fled to the United States.
   The first feeling to sweep Watertown when word of the quake came
was despair, said Ara Kalaydjian, editor of the Armenian Mirror
Spectator.
   ``But now it's changed into determination to build again and not
for decades _ for centuries,'' Kalaydjian said.
   Friday morning, donors with checks and clothing and offers to
help raise money began arriving at St. James.
   People spoke of crying all night long. Children laid flowers at
the granite monument memorializing the Armenian massacre.
   When the tears dried, people put their energy into trying to
contact friends and relatives in the Soviet Union and to donate
money and other aid.
   The Armenian Assembly of New England was to begin a telethon
today to raise funds, and asked that donations of food and clothing
be brought to the TWA cargo hangar at Logan International Airport
for an emergency airlift.
   Armenians first settled in large numbers in Massachusetts in the
last century, when wire manufacturers in the central Massachusetts
city of Worcester recruited workers in the Near East, said the Rev.
Dajad Davidian, St. James' pastor. The first Armenian Apostolic
Church in the United States was established in Worcester in 1891.
   Some of those first settlers later moved to Watertown, then a
center of the rubber industry.
   On Friday, long faces spoke of shared grief and anxious hours
trying to get through to Armenia by telephone.
   Luda Esserian said she learned through a call that her sister,
Sofa, and her family were safe. The family lives in Stepanavan, an
Armenian village that sustained major damage. Although their home
was leveled, they were unharmed and are staying temporarily with
relatives in Yerevan.
   ``We listen to the radio all day,'' said Sonya Ourfalian, owner
of the Massis bakery, where shelves were stocked high with such Near
Eastern delicacies as dried figs and pastries heavy with honey.
   Though of Armenian extraction, Mrs. Ourfalian, 49, grew up in
Lebanon and has no relations in the Soviet Union. But she said the
feeling of connection with the quake victims runs deep.
   ``They are our people,'' she said. ``They are Armenians.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Battle Police, March On Palace To Demand Chun's Arrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters demanding the
arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan battled riot police today
with firebombs and rocks after they were blocked from marching to
the presidential palace.
   Radical students and dissidents fought police in the city's main
shopping district, tearing chunks of concrete from sidewalks and
pelting riot troopers with firebombs that burst in orange blasts of
blazing gasoline.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!''
protesters shouted.
   Police had no figures on arrests or injuries, but officers and
protesters were seen with blood pouring from head wounds and other
injuries. Some police and protesters were brutally beaten after
being caught by the other side.
   Violence broke out when more than 2,000 people tried to march to
the Blue House presidential mansion after a rally at Myongdong
Cathedral.
   Dissident leaders announced at the rally the formation of a new
alliance to push for Chun's arrest and the overthrow of Roh.
Speakers said Chun could not be brought to justice while the Roh
government is in place.
   Riot police blocked the marchers with shields. Students with iron
bars and wooden clubs attacked police but were driven off by
tear-gas grenades.
   Hundreds of protesters regrouped several blocks away and attacked
police with firebombs. Police cleared the main streets several
times, but protesters repeatedly surged from backstreets and drove
the troopers back.
   Terrified people, many of them out Christmas shopping, fled as
firebombs and tear-gas grenades exploded around them. Riot police
chasing protesters hurled tear-gas grenades into subway stations.
   The protest was much smaller than three major violent protests in
Seoul last month to demand Chun's arrest for alleged corruption and
human rights abuses during his seven years in office.
   In another protest today, four Buddhist monks and 14 radical
students clashed with police several hundred yards from the remote
Buddhist temple on the east coast where Chun is in exile. The former
president went into exile after publicly apologizing for abuses
committed during his seven-year rule.
   The South Korean news agency Yonhap said fighting began when
police stopped protesters trying to approach the temple. Students
and police fought with clubs and six people were injured, Yonhap
said.
   Opposition leaders accused Roh of delaying action against Chun
and repeated demands that the former president cooperate with the
National Assembly probe of misdeeds under his rule.
   Kim Dae-jung, who heads South Korea's main opposition group, the
Party for Peace and Democracy, charged Roh with ``moving backward.''
   Another opposition leader, Kim Young-sam, urged Roh to
immediately remove all vestiges of the Chun era and take
``tangible'' measures such as releasing all political prisoners.
   Roh asked the nation to forgive Chun after the former president
apologized and went into internal exile.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, stepped down in February at the end of a seven-year term. Roh,
another ex-general, won presidential elections last December.

<HEAD>AIDS Patient Awarded $3.9 Million For Tainted Transfusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who said he contracted AIDS from a blood
transfusion during heart surgery was awarded $3.9 million by a jury
which found a blood center negligent for not screening blood donors.
   ``I'm going to spend the rest of my short life trying to help
other people who are less fortunate than me and also help victims of
AIDS, no matter how they caught it,'' said John Carroll, 63, of
surburban Brookfield.
   Carroll testified that he might die within a year.
   The award was announced Friday in Circuit Court. Carroll's
attorney, Robert L. Habush, said it was ``the biggest AIDS verdict
in the U.S.''
   Carroll's lawsuit said the Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin
did not test blood that was shipped March 6, 1985, to a hospital
where he had heart surgery a month later.
   The center did not begin testing donated blood until March 7,
1985, and was unaware until November 1985 when the donor returned
that he carried the AIDS virus, the lawsuit said.
   Carroll said he learned in 1986 from the center that he might
have been exposed to the virus. The hospital was dismissed as a
defendant.
   ``They're going to have to review and analyze their procedures
and their systems and I think they might well have to make many
changes,'' Carroll saud after the award was announced.
   James R. Gutglass, attorney for the center, said his client and
its insuror would consider options in response to the verdict.
   The center feels ``sympathetic for the family and saddened by
what happened,'' Gutglass said.
   Earlier this month, a jury in San Francisco found a blood bank
negligent for improperly screening its blood in the case of a
5{-year-old boy who contracted AIDS through a transfusion. The
family was awarded $500,000 in compensatory damages but nothing for
pain and suffering.
   The San Francisco verdict was believed to be the first of its
kind.
   A Denver jury in June cleared a blood bank of liability in the
case of a woman who contracted AIDS through a transfusion. A similar
case in California in 1986 ended in a settlement before the trial
ended.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   Icy air streaming over the Great Lakes spawned snow squalls
throughout much of the Northeast today, with New York, Ohio and
Pennsylvania getting the brunt of the frozen precipitation.
   Most of the snow fell near lakes Erie and Ontario, with up to 6
inches of snow reported at Oswego, N.Y., and in the northeast corner
of Ohio.
   On Friday, up to 10 inches of snow blanketed West Virginia, over
the Mountain State's southern mountains and over the coal fields
near the Virginia border. Up to 10 inches fell across the mountains
of southwestern Virginia.
   In Tennessee, a twin-engine airplane carrying 40 pounds of
cocaine and $7,000 cash crashed into a snowy field outside
Knoxville, killing its pilot and a lone passenger. Police put the
cocaine's worth at $450,000.
   The plane was en route from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Dayton,
Ohio, with a fuel stop in Knoxville when it apparently lost an
engine, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker
of Atlanta.
   Early today, snow stretched into northeastern New York and
northern and central portions of Vermont. In New York, snow fell on
portions of the Mohawk Valley, where heavy squalls were expected to
dump up to 6 inches of snow this morning.
   Elsewhere, light rain spread from southeast Arizona to southern
New Mexico and central Texas. Rain and snow were expected to become
more widespread as a slow-moving storm over northwestern Mexico
moved eastward. Some of the rain was expected to turn to snow, and
the mountains of southern New Mexico could receive more than 4
inches.
   Clear skies prevailed in the middle and south Atlantic states,
the Tennessee Valley and the central Plains.
   Today's forecast called for snow from Michigan to the northern
and central Appalachians; scattered snow through much of Montana;
snow or rain through western Texas; rain from central and eastern
Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley; and fog in California's San
Joaquin Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits and teens
from northern New England to northern New York, the upper Great
Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley and parts of the Dakotas; the
40s and 50s from the Carolinas to the Tennessee Valley, the Gulf
Coast states and much of Texas, and from the southern Rockies to the
Pacific Northwest; the 60s and 70s over much of California and the
desert Southwest, from the 60s to the 80s over the Florida
peninsula; and in the 20s and 30s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn., to 70 degrees at Key West
Naval Air Station, Fla.

   President-elect George Bush's ability to
control the $150 billion federal budget deficit and the trade
deficit will have a lasting effect on his foreign policy, a former
secretary of state says.
   ``Economics and foreign policy are ever-increasingly
entertwined,'' said Cyrus Vance, who headed the State Department
under President Carter.
   Vance, one of five former secretaries of state here Friday, spoke
at a news conference before they began taping a two-hour television
special to be aired by Public Broadcasting Service stations Jan. 2.
   Vance said Bush must deal strongly and effectively with ``the
twin deficits, the budget deficit and the trade deficit. ... What he
does in regard to that particular issue is going to have a major
effect, in the long run, on our foreign policy.''
   The Sixth Annual Report from the Secretaries of State was
sponsored by the Atlanta-based Southern Center for International
Studies and Nashville's David Lipscomb University. The former
Cabinet officials were invited here by Gov. Ned McWherter, a trustee
of the non-profit educational organization.
   The former secretaries said Bush should continue President
Reagan's policies toward Russia but should not gear them to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I think he may be gone in a couple of years,'' Vance said.
   ``Gorbachev acts as he does because he recognizes that the Soviet
economy is a mess and it has to be improved,'' said Henry Kissinger,
secretary of state under presidents Nixon and Ford. ``It's a big
mistake to gear our policies totally to one Soviet personality.''
   Vance agreed with Kissinger that Gorbachev faces an uphill battle
in bringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fall
from power if he fails.
   William Rogers, also secretary of state under Nixon, said Bush
should ``continue the policies of the Reagan administration.... I
think the prospects for peace are very good (but) we have to remain
strong militarily.''
   There was some disagreement with Reagan:
   _ Kissinger opposed talks with Iran regarding the Lebanese
hostage situation, as the president suggested in a Thursday news
conference.
   _ Vance called refusal to admit Yasser Arafat into the country to
address the United Nations a serious mistake that will handicap Bush
policies.
   Kissinger said he was violently opposed to any talks on releasing
hostages.
   ``Once you begin negotiating on the release of hostages, you have
indicated there is the price and the only thing left to negotiate is
the price _ and therefore, hostage taking has a reward,'' Kissinger
said. ``I know this sounds cruel, I know this is tough on the
families, but I believe that devaluing hostages is the only way you
can prevent hostages from being taken.''
   Kissinger and Edmund Muskie, who succeeded Vance as secretary of
state under Carter, predicted the hostages in Lebanon will be
released because it will be in Iran's interest to try to return
relations with the United States to normal.
   Vance said Secretary of State George Shultz's decision not to
grant Arafat a visa to argue for a Palestine state before the United
Nations ``was a serious mistake because it helped those who were
opposed to progress in the Middle East and it disadvantaged those
who would like to see us get the peace process going ahead. I think
it makes it more difficult for the Bush administration to act as an
honest broker in the Middle East.''

   Architect Joseph Esherick reluctantly
stepped into the spotlight to accept his profession's highest award,
the American Insitute of Architecture's Gold Medal.
   Esherick, 73, was named Friday as the 47th recipient of the award.
   But joining the ranks of architectural greats Frank Lloyd Wright
and I.M. Pei was a burden as well as an honor to the man who
designed The Cannery at Fisherman's Wharf and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium.
   ``There's a lot of explaining to do,'' said Esherick, who was
greeted by a 40-foot-long congratulatory banner signed by co-workers
Friday morning.
   ``I don't mean that as false modesty or negativeness,'' he
continued. ``I think what this represents is the AIA recognizing
somewhat more modest architecture, less pretentious architecture
that isn't attention-grabbing.''
   Esherick has designed more than 100 homes and everything from a
ski resort in Utah to several Bay Area Rapid Transit stations.
   ``A building really ought to make people's lives better,'' he
said Friday. ``It shouldn't get in the way of what they're trying to
do and it shouldn't dominate the scene.''
   ``You're not supposed to talk about spiritual things or beauty
anymore but that's really what it comes down to,'' he added.
   In a statement, AIA 1989 president Benjamin Brewer Jr., called
Esherick an ``outstanding designer ... and a humanist'' whose
overriding concern is ``to create wonderful places for people, not
extravagant statements.''
   The institute's selection of Esherick is significant because it
honors an unpretentious style of architecture, said Roger
Montgomery, dean of the College of Environmental Design at the
University of California at Berkeley, where Esherick was a faculty
member in architecture for 35 years.
   Esherick said his work has been influenced by traditions of the
Quaker religion, which he learned about during his upbringing in
Philadelphia.
   ``They do great things but they never force anything on
anybody,'' he said. ``I think that's shaped very much my view of
things.''

<HEAD>Nippon Executive Resigns In Connection With Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An executive of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
was dismissed from his job in connection with a stock scandal that
led to the resignation of the finance minister.
   Ei Shikiba, director of the telephone giant's data communications
department, was relieved of his duties but will remain an executive
director of the company with no specific responsibilities, company
president Haruo Yamaguchi said Friday.
   Shikaba was dismissed for buying unlisted shares in Recruit Co.,
the parent company of the Recruit-Cosmos real estate company.
   Aides of more than a dozen influential politicians reportedly
earned large profits by buying unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos and
then selling them after they were publicly listed in October 1986.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigned Friday after making
conflicting statements regarding the scandal.
   He initially testified to a parliamentary committee investigating
the scandal that a third party, a friend of his former secretary,
purchased 10,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares and only borrowed the name of
``Miyazawa.''
   He later admitted his ex-secretary actually paid 30 million yen,
or about $246,000, for the shares in September 1986 and sold them
for 52.7 million yen, or $431,000, less than a month after they were
listed.
   Miyazawa also insisted the stock purchase was not financed by a
Recruit-linked financial institution but refused to show bank
documents to back up his argument.
   NTT, Japan's largest telephone company, has been criticized for
its close ties with Recruit, which reportedly include the leasing of
large numbers of telephone circuits at reduced rates and the resale
of two U.S.-made supercomputers.
   Shikiba had previously admitted purchasing 5,000 shares of
Recruit-Cosmos stock but did not notify the company of his
acquisition of Recruit shares, news reports said.
   Opposition parties have demanded a full investigation into the
stock scandal and have blocked parliamentary debate on a proposed
tax overhaul to press their demands.
   Miyazawa, who had been under political fire for weeks, said he
was resigning to pave the way for the tax reform.
   After Miyazawa's resignation, the governing Liberal Democratic
Party set a timetable for debate on the tax reform bills. If
deliberations are carried out smoothly, the package will pass before
Dec. 28, when the current parliamentary session is due to end.
   The legislation, Japan's first sweeping overhaul of its tax
system since the end of the World War II, has been a top priority
for the Liberal Democratic Party for a decade.
   Successive administrations have failed to pass the reform due to
a lack of public support and strong resistance from opposition
parties.
   The new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax
scales and introduces a 3-percent sales tax.

<TEXT>
   The death toll from Israel's deepest
incursion inside Lebanon in five years rose to 10 after a
Palestinian guerrilla died of his wounds, police said today.
   Eight other guerrillas and an Israeli officer were killed Friday
in nine hours of air, sea and ground combat in hills overlooking the
coastal town of Naameh, nine miles south of Beirut.
   Three Israeli soldiers were injured and 16 guerrillas were
wounded, including one who police said died during the night in a
hospital.
   Lebanon requested an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council
to debate the attack, which drew sharp condemnation from the United
States and Britain.
   The Israeli raid coincided with the first anniversary of the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, in which at least 320 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been
killed.
   The target of the raid was a major base of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the Naameh bluffs, 50
miles north of the Israeli border.
   It was the first time the Israeli army had come so close to the
Lebanese capital, Beirut, since it evacuated the Chouf mountains
southeast of the city in 1983, ending a yearlong occupation.
   Israeli paratroopers were dropped from helicopters in to a ravine
below an abandoned Maronite Catholic monastery and attacked the
living quarters and training center of the guerrillas, Lebanese
police said.
   The Israelis used dogs strapped with tear-gas canisters and
explosives to flush out guerrillas from an underground network of
tunnels, Popular Front commander Ahmed Jibril told reporters.
   One of his aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Palestinian fighters shot and killed five dogs.
   Several previous Israeli air attacks this year have failed to
eliminate the Popular Front's Naameh base.
   The radical Popular Front, which opposes Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, is armed by Syria and
bankrolled by Libya.
   During the fighting Friday, four Israelis were cut off from the
main landing force, prompting the Israeli command to mount a massive
rescue operation.
   Waves of Israeli fighter-bombers thundered in on rocketing and
strafing runs and naval gunboats shelled Naameh's highlands until
the four Israelis were ferried out of Lebanon at mid-morning,
clinging to the struts of two helicopter gunships, an Israeli army
officer said.
   The Israeli raid was the second biggest in terms of casualities
this year. At least 40 Palestinian and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
guerrillas were killed when the Israeli army mounted a three-day
sweep in southeast Lebanon in May.
   In both attacks, Syrian troops stationed close to guerrilla bases
did not intervene in the confrontations.
   The Syrians maintain about 40,000 troops in north and east
Lebanon as well as Beirut's Moslem sector under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to control Lebanon's civil war, now in its 14th year.

<HEAD>Steinberg's Lawyers Press Ahead With Insanity Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a man accused in the beating death of
his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter say they will press ahead
next week in asking the court's permission to pursue an insanity
defense.
   Attorney Ira London said Friday that Joel Steinberg was
delusional the night Lisa Steinberg was fatally injured.
   London said Steinberg thought Lisa was staring at him because she
was under the influence of a cult that hypnotized people and then
used them for sex.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, raised Lisa from birth but never
formally adopted her.
   A psychiatrist who twice examined Steinberg has prepared an
affidavit saying the murder defendant has a ``delusional disorder _
paranoid type'' and will testify to that in court, London said.
   ``He thought he was helping Lisa, not hurting her,'' London said.
``He thought he was saving her from the cult, getting her out of her
trance.''
   Prosecution witness Charles Scannapieco said a few weeks ago that
he saw Steinberg slap Lisa during an auto trip to Albany. He said
Steinberg explained that the child had gone into a trance and was
staring and he was bringing her out of it.
   London said that if Steinberg is delusional, then he cannot be
guilty of ``depraved indifference'' in Lisa's death, as prosecutors
charge, and the jury hearing the murder trial should be told this.
   London said he will try to use testimony from lay witnesses to
show Steinberg is not criminally responsible if state judge Harold
Rothwax rejects his request to present an insanity defense.
   ``If we're not permitted to present psychiatric evidence, we can
still present testimonial evidence from lay people ... to indicate
that his conduct was not depraved but rather, it was insane.''
   Last week, Rothwax temporarily rejected the defense request to be
allowed to present an insanity defense.
   The judge said insanity pleas usually must come with in 30 days
of a defendant's plea to an indictment. But he said he would allow
the defense to apply again after the lawyers submitted papers
explaining why the request is late and what new psychiatric evidence
they have.
   Steinberg, 47, denies that he hit the girl, but Hedda Nussbaum,
Steinberg's battered, longtime live-in companion, has testified that
he did.
   Lisa, a first-grader described as bright and outgoing, was
removed unconscious from Steinberg's Greenwich Village apartment
Nov. 2, 1987. She died of head injuries three days later.
   Her death led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   London spoke about the insanity defense outside the courtroom
after Friday's court session was cancelled because two jurors were
sick.

   A reporter six miles from the shattered Soviet city
of Leninakan said today an earthquake has changed the landscape of
the region, which once was dotted with buildings and sparkled with
city lights at night.
   Now, looking at Leninakan from the Turkish border, ``all you can
see is a sort of hazy mist, almost a cloud ... rising from the
rubble and ruins of the town,'' Jane Howard of the British
Broadcasting Corp. said in a radio broadcast.
   Ms. Howard said she went to the border after arriving Friday at
the northeast Turkish town of Kars, 40 miles from Leninakan, one of
the cities hit hardest in Wednesday's killer earthquake. About
250,000 people lived in Leninakan, the second-biggest city in the
Armenian republic.
   ``From the border you could actually look across and see the
town,'' Ms. Howard said. ``(The earthquake) really does seem to have
changed the whole landscape of the area.''
   ``I was there when dusk fell and whereas last week you would have
been able to see bright lights from street lights and security
points along the border, there was only a very faint glow there last
night (Friday),'' she said.
   ``The one thing you can hear on the border is a sort of almost
constant low rumble. It is the drone of transport planes flying
relief supplies in.
   ``Occasionally you hear a helicopter or see the light of a
helicopter going in, although most of the relief operation is being
mounted from (the Armenian capital) Yerevan... Clearly they are
mounting a huge 24-hour operation over there,'' the report said.
   Yerevan is about 60 miles southeast of Leninakan.
   Ms. Howard said the temperature in the area has been below
freezing but that there was no snow on the ground.
   She said there was very little damage on the Turkish side of the
border.

   Nobel laureate Lech Walesa of Poland today praised
reforms under way in the Soviet Union and told Soviet dissident
Andrei Sakharov the changes would be good for his country, a Walesa
aide said.
   The Nobel Peace Prize winners met for the first time before
ceremonies got under way marking the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   ``Walesa spoke of the (human rights) problems in Poland. Sakharov
spoke of the (human rights) problems in the Soviet Union, and Walesa
said he thinks perestroika is a good program for both countries,''
Bronislaw Gemerek told reporters. Perestroika refers to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's economic and social restructuring.
   Gemerek is traveling with Walesa, the leader of Poland's
Solidarity trade union movement. He said the meeting lasted 45
minutes.
   The two men later met separately with Premier Michel Rocard and
then posed together with Rocard.
   ``To be simultaneously in the presence of Walesa and Sakharov
means we are among the most courageous activists for human rights,''
Rocard said.
   Sakharov and Walesa were among the dignitaries and activists who
gathered in Paris for ceremonies marking the 1948 global pledge to
protect human rights. President Francois Mitterrand and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar were among the scheduled
speakers
   The Paris trip was the first time Walesa has been allowed to
leave Poland since martial law was declared in 1981. He won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1983.
   Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, came to Paris
after a four-week visit to the United States.
   At a 90-minute news conference at the Soviet Embassy on Friday,
he called for more steps to reduce the size of the Soviet military.
Sakharov said one way to do this would be to limit the length of
service for Soviet draftees.
   He said Gorbachev's plans to cut the Red Army by 500,000 troops,
or nearly 10 percent, and withdraw thousands of tanks and troops
from Eastern Europe is only a beginning.
   Sakharov said reductions in manpower and weapons ``can be done
and will change in a major way the international situation.
Gorbachev is going in this direction and this is very important. I
would have liked to see bigger cuts but what was done is important.''
   As developer of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, Sakharov previously was
barred from traveling abroad because the Soviets said his scientific
work gave him knowledge of state secrets.
   He was also restricted to the closed city of Gorky for seven
years because of his outspoken opposition to Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
   But in 1986, Gorbachev personally called him back to Moscow.
Since then, Sakharov has generally supported Gorbachev's
perestroika, or political and economic restructuring, while speaking
out against some trends, including the growing concentration of
power in Gorbachev's hands.
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N.
General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic document under which
member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolish
torture and slavery.
   Despite the declaration, Amnesty International alleges that
torture is still practiced by about one-third of the world's
governments.
   In Paraguay, police in the past three days detained about 30
people, including opposition leaders, journalists and trade union
members, to prevent a march to mark today's anniversary. The march,
planned in Asuncion, was declared illegal last week by the
government of strongman President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   The president of Cyprus, George Vassiliou, meanwhile, sent an
anniversary message to the U.N. chief appealing for help in
restoring human rights, which he said have been violated in his
country for years.
   ``This year's anniversary is of particular significance to the
people of Cyprus, whose human rights and fundamental freedoms have
for many years been massively and ruthlessly violated,'' the message
said, referring to the 14-year Turkish occupation of the north of
the Mediterranean island nation.

   Viewers will see a new Jim Bakker when the
founder of the PTL television ministry and his wife tape several TV
specials from their living room, one of his attorneys said.
   ``I think we'll see a more introspective and cautious Jim Bakker
in his message,'' attorney Jim Toms said Friday. ``His new public
ministry will be targeted not just to Christian charismatics but to
hurting people.
   ``He has a lot to share about what he has learned,'' Toms said.
   Jim and Tammy Bakker plan to tape several TV specials from the
living room of their 14-room log cabin near Pineville, Toms said.
   ``He's hoping to get on the air in the next 30 days,'' he said.
   Bakker has not had a regular TV show since he resigned from the
ministry in March 1987 in the wake of a sex-and-money scandal. He
has been preaching recently at a converted skating rink in
Charlotte, where his New Covenant Church is based.
   Bakker has not spoken publicly since his indictment Monday on
federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Bakker, 48, and a top aide at
PTL are accused of diverting more than $4 million of PTL money to
support their own ``lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles.
   PTL, in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987, must sell its
assets to pay creditors. A federal bankruptcy judge in Columbia,
S.C., has scheduled an auction for Monday.
   Toms said Bakker will likely preach Sunday about what he has
learned from his experiences. ``My expectation is that he'll be
there (at the church) and he'll have something to say,'' said Toms.
``Getting his message out is important.''

<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit may be the No.
1 problem facing the 101st Congress, but no easy answers were
offered at the opening of this weekend's symposium for 27 newly
elected members of Congress at Harvard.
   The problem ``is one we are going to be dealing with, and I think
not just in the next two years,'' Alice M. Rivlin, founding director
of the Congressional Budget Office, told the legislators-elect Friday
   ``The budget deficit is going to dominate thinking ... about
fiscal policies for the foreseeable future and I expect for much of
your congressional careers, which I hope are long ones,'' she said.
   Rivlin, now a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings
Institution in Washington, briefed the new legislators for more than
an hour on the budget shortfall and assorted theories on correcting
it in the only public session planned during a five-day series of
seminars.
   The program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government is
co-sponsored by the House Administration Committee. It has been held
every two years since 1972 as part of the orientation for new
members of Congress.
   The budget deficit, which in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 was
$155.1 billion, ``is the No. 1 topic we discussed throughout our
campaign'' and the one issue most on constituents' minds, newly
elected Georgia Democrat Ben Lewis Jones said.
   To deal with it ``we are going to have to make some tough
choices, and they (Georgia voters) sent me here to make those tough
choices,'' Jones said.
   But as Democratic Rep.-elect Richard Neal of Massachusetts said,
``It is very easy to define the problems, but it's very difficult to
provide solutions.''
   Rivlin noted that the deficit has been shrinking ``and with good
luck in the economy, the budget deficit will come down a little bit
more. And that is progress.''
   But she said a large part of the reason for that progress is that
surpluses in the Social Security system are being used to pay for
``current expenses of government and to offset the large deficit of
the rest of the federal budget.''
   Saying the money might be better used to buy back government debt
and prepare for the large numbers of retirees who will be making
claims on Social Security in the years ahead, she said, ``It's
important to be clear _ things are worse than they seem.''
   ``My own view,'' Rivlin said, ``is that you've got to reach for
some more revenue.''
   On a short-term basis, she suggested increases in excise taxes
for such things as gasoline, reducing Medicare benefits and taxing
Social Security.
   Newly elected Mississippi Democrat Paul Michael Parker said that
unlike the European community, the United States is always looking
for short-term solutions. ``We lack that long-term planning.''
   Yet when Rivlin offered long-term proposals to ease the deficit,
several new representatives bristled.
   Rivlin said Congress could consider a broad-based value-added
tax, such as a national sales tax, and ``getting rid of some of the
major functions of the federal government and turning them over to
the states,'' such as housing and education programs.
   The legislators-elect challenged the sales tax idea as
regressive, or tending to hurt the poor, and said putting more
demands on the states would be ``unbearable'' for local governments.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived today in
Armenia where search dogs, medical teams and rescue workers
struggled to save men, women and children buried in the rubble of an
earthquake that officials say killed at least 40,000 people.
   After a three-hour flight from Moscow, Gorbachev landed in
Leninakan, a city of 290,000 where more than three-fourths of the
housing, including multi-story apartment buildings, was destroyed.
   The government declared a day of national mourning. Across the
country, hotels, campgrounds and private homes were opened to
survivors of the quake.
   Soviet officials said today that 1,500 people had been rescued
from ruins where they had been trapped since the earthquake struck
Wednesday.
   The official news agency Tass said today that French teams
working with Soviet rescuers had saved 60 people.
   Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov said time was running out on
those still trapped by the quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale.
   The first official death toll was released today when Deputy
Foreign Minister Valentin Nikiforov said that according to ``the
first preliminary information, 40,000-45,000 people died as a result
of the earthquake.''
   In nearby Turkey, the governor of its eastern province on the
Soviet border, Hasan Pakir, was quoted by Anatolia News Agency as
saying, ``Next door to us thousands of people died. We escaped a
possible catastrophe.''
   He said only four people died in Kars province from the quake.
   The toll is lower than that estimated Friday by Leonid Zamyatin,
the Soviet ambassador to Britain, who estimated 80,000 people had
been killed.
   Nikiforov told a news conference today that 12,000 people were
injured and nearly 7,000 are hospitalized, many with burns and
crushed limbs when the quake struck Armenia, a republic of 3.3
million 1,200 miles southeast of Moscow.
   ``Everything that could burn was burning,'' after the quake hit,
Council of Ministers spokesman Yuri P. Chapligin said. Throughout
the area, electrical appliances, gas stoves, and industrial fuel and
explosives ignited after the shock, he said.
   The first Western planeloads of doctors, search dogs and medical
supplies arrived Friday as people from around the world joined a
rescue effort made extraordinary because it occurred in a land
normally closed to foreigners.
   In Moscow, authorities were preparing to take in 10,000 children
whose parents' whereabouts apparently were unknown, the Communist
daily Pravda reported. Private families have offered to take in
orphans and injured adults, the newspaper said.
   The Armenian community, however, is ``indignant,'' fearful such
measures may permanently separate children from parents who may
still be alive, said Bishop Tiran Durakyan of the Armenian Church in
Moscow.
   Firefighters said they pulled about 80 people out of the rubble
in Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city.
   ``In these conditions, delaying by each hour means an additional
20 killed of every thousand concealed under debris. Such is the
terrifying arithmetic,'' Chazov told the newspaper Izvestia.
   Tass provided a damage report from the stricken region. According
to the report:
   _The hardest-hit cities were Leninakan, Krovakan, Stepanavan and
Spitak. Spitak and its surrounding villages were ``demolished
practically altogether.''
   _All of Leninakan's 1,100 privately owned houses were damaged or
destroyed.
   _Hundreds of apartment buildings collapsed in the cities of
Kirovakan and Stepanavan.
   The influx of worldwide aid was unprecedented for the Soviet
Union. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, U.S. doctors were the only
foreign aid personnel allowed in.
   Cuba on Friday sent 32 tons of medical supplies, and President
Fidel Castro was one of the first to donate blood.
   A U.S. cargo plane left Washington today to deliver medical
supplies and canine search teams. The operation marks the first
large-scale U.S. government assistance to Soviet Union in the
post-World War II era.
   British fashion designer Katherine Hamnett said her firm was
donating $14,700 in heavy woolen fabric for blankets and warm
clothing.
   Muscovites donated money at their workplaces.
   Soviet television showed rescuers combing flattened buildings,
carefully removing blocks of concrete to search for survivors. A
correspondent said the workers could hear voices below.
   ``Somewhere here is my brother,'' said a man standing in the
debris. ``He worked as a factory director. He came home during a
break and stayed here. Children are here ... and father, they just
took him away. They took him to his funeral.''
   Smoked wafted from the rubble and the man added in a hoarse
voice: ``I don't know, maybe they (the children) already burned up
here because we haven't been able to extinguish this fire for
several days. Oh, the grief is terrible.''
   In London, Independent Television news carried a voice report
from Stella Gregorian, an American student at Yerevan University.
   She said she saw ``people only digging for people who they heard
voices from. If they heard no voices they are going on to places
where they can hear voices. There are countless, countless people
underneath these buildings that they can't get to.''
   Flags flew at half-staff and entertainment activities were
canceled because of the national day of mourning. Armenian leaders
had declared Friday and today days of mourning in their republic.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Accepts Nobel, Chides U.S. For Failing To Pay Dues</HEAD>

   The United Nations' chief today accepted the
Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of U.N. peacekeeping troops but warned
that their mission is threatened because the United States and other
nations don't pay their dues.
   ``Peacekeeping uses soldiers as servants of peace rather than as
the instruments of war. It introduces to the military sphere the
principle of non-violence,'' U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said.
   His hands appeared to shake with emotion as he received the gold
medal and prize certificate from Egil Aarvik, chairman of the Nobel
Committee. Aarvik noted that it was the first time in the prize's
87-year history it was awarded to military forces.
   Perez de Cuellar said 733 men have been killed since U.N.
peacekeeping operations began in 1948. In all, about 500,000
soldiers from 58 countries have served in the forces, and 10,000 are
now on duty.
   One of them, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, is held
hostage in Lebanon, the U.N. leader noted, and he appealed for
Higgins' release.
   ``Never before in history have military forces been employed
internationally not to wage war, not to establish domination and not
to serve the interests of any power or group of powers, but rather
to prevent conflict between peoples,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   ``There is a new mood of understanding and common sense,'' said
Perez de Cuellar, who was accompanied by an honor guard of the
blue-bereted peacekeeping soldiers.
   The U.N. chief cited progress on U.N. efforts to end the
Iran-Iraq war and conflicts in Afghanistan, the Western Sahara,
southern Africa and elsewhere.
   On Friday, Perez de Cuellar accepted the monetary portion of the
award _ $416,000 _ a fraction of the $450 million in dues owed by
U.N. members.
   ``I don't know how we're going to cope financially,'' he said.
``In some ways it's embarrassing because it forces me to say
publicly that the United States still owes the United Nations almost
$350 million.''
   The United States has withheld dues in recent years to protest
what the Reagan administration saw as mismanagement, overstaffing
and anti-Western bias at the 159-member body. President Reagan said
in September the United States would gradually repay all its dues.
   Asked when the U.N. would pay its own peacekeeping force bills to
Norway, Denmark, Britain, Canada and other countries that provide
troops, Perez de Cuellar said: ``They are all understanding. They
think we are honest people. But unfortunately, not everyone is
honest with us.''
   In a report this week, Perez de Cuellar predicted the world body
would end next year with a loss of $24.6 million. Only 79 members
had paid all their dues by Nov. 30, the report said.
   He said Friday that the Soviet Union owed about $100 million, but
he praised the Soviets for setting a payment schedule and sticking
to it.
   The Nobel check is usually presented after the medal ceremony,
but Perez de Cuellar had to fly immediately to Paris after the
ceremony for the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights
Convention.
   The medal ceremony is always held on the anniversary of the Dec.
10 death of Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of
dynamite.

   President Corazon Aquino vowed today
to punish human rights violators in the military, saying soldiers
who abuse prisoners are also capable of plotting coups against her.
   But Mrs. Aquino, in a Human Rights Day speech, blamed most abuses
in the Philippines on communist rebels and dared critics to prove
charges that her government pays only lip service to human rights.
   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged ``sporadic'' violations of human rights
by soldiers and said that although the government does not condone
such abuses, they are likely to continue because of the 19-year
communist insurgency.
   ``Yet I will not accept the heat of battle as an excuse for
brutality toward the people we are pledged to protect and even
toward our enemies,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Democracy needs force, but
this government will not stoop to terrorism to survive.''
   Mrs. Aquino, who has survived six reported coup attempts since
she came to power in 1986, said she had every reason to punish human
rights violators in the military because ``the hand that can abuse a
prisoner will have the mind to plot a coup d'etat.''
   As the president spoke, about 1,500 students demonstrated in a
downtown Manila square denouncing human rights abuses which they
blamed on the ``U.S.-Aquino regime.'' The rally ended peacefully.
   ``This new government has never adopted by neglect or design a
policy or pattern of human rights violations for any purpose,'' Mrs.
Aquino said.
   That violations will continue ``is inevitable in a country driven
by a rebellion led by fanatics,'' she said, referring to the
25,000-strong communist New People's Army which has fought since
1969 to set up a Marxist state.
   ``If there is a conscious policy of terrorism in this country,
you will find it among them,'' she added, citing killings of police
and soldiers by urban guerrillas, executions of rebels planning to
surrender and extortion of money from people in the countryside.
   Mrs. Aquino said she has ordered the military to step up its
counterinsurgency ``to shorten the agony'' of her country.
   The government's Commission on Human Rights said it has received
reports of 951 cases of human rights violations since June 1986, of
which 578 were allegedly committed by rebels, 303 by anti-communist
vigilantes and 70 by soldiers. Most of the cases filed against the
rebels were for insurgency-related killings.
   A few hours before Mrs. Aquino's speech, a six-member delegation
representing various foreign human rights groups reported the
results of a 10-day fact-finding tour of the Philippines.
   Laurie Wiseberg, leader of the group, composed of a Canadian,
three Australians and two Americans, said they received reports that
human rights abuses have increased since a 60-day cease-fire between
the government and communist rebels collapsed in February 1987.
   On Friday, Mrs. Aquino ordered the Justice Department to
investigate reported disappearances of human rights activists.
   Trade union and social activist organizations have complained
that Mrs. Aquino has failed to live up to a promise she made when
she took power in 1986 to end human rights violations.
   On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch, a New York-based civil liberties
group, said the Philippines leads the world in the number of
documented cases of violence against human rights workers.
   The organization said 30 human rights workers worldwide were
slain last year, nine of them in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Shiite Cleric Says Hostages' Issue On Ice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential Shiite Moslem cleric was
quoted today as saying the question of foreign hostages in Lebanon
is ``in the fridge'' while the issue is investigated.
   ``The question (of the hostages) is now in the fridge, pending
the completion of backstage probes that could influence the issue,''
said Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. He did not elaborate.
   Fadlallah was quoted by the An Nahar Arab and International, a
weekly based in Christian east Beirut. None of the magazine's
previous reports about the hostages have proved accurate.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for Shiite extremist
factions holding most of the foreign hostages.
   Fourteen foreign hostages are being held in Lebanon, including
nine Americans. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   In addition, Peter Winkler, a Swiss Red Cross worker, was
abducted Nov. 17 in southern Lebanon, but no group has claimed
responsibility.
   In a separate report today, An Nahar said Hezbollah had
threatened to kill some of the hostages to stop attacks on its
positions in west and south Beirut by the rival, Syrian-backed
Shiite Amal militia last month.
   The magazine did not identify the hostages Hezbollah allegedly
threatened to kill or give further details.
   The rival factions have long been vying for dominance of the 1
million Shiites who make up the largest single sect of Lebanon's
population of 4 million.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat today called on
Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories to escalate their
year-old uprising and warned the Israelis planned to intensify
measures to choke it off.
   In a message to the ``masses'' in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
honor of the anniversary of the uprising, Arafat declared: ``You are
recording a new victory in the march toward liberation with every
daybreak.''
   The text of the Arabic-language statement was released by the
Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Cyprus.
   Arafat said: ``You have made them (the Israelis) feel the chains
of international isolation and the bankruptcy of their occupation
policy.
   ``But, my loved ones, you must be on alert as they undoubtedly
will resort to escalating the criminal, oppressive measures of their
so-called `iron fist' policy, as well as the aggression against our
refugee camps.
   ``As we near victory,'' the PLO chief said, ``We must realize
that the most ferocious and bloody confrontations occur in the last
quarter of an hour before peace.''
   Arafat has often said that sustaining the intefadeh, or uprising,
would eventually force Israel and the United States to deal with the
PLO and endorse the Palestinian quest for an independent state.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987, 322
Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed.
   In his speech, Arafat made no reference to his latest peace
overtures, including recent statements that some have interpreted as
explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist.
   He spoke only of the Nov. 15 declaration in Algiers by the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
proclaiming an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza and calling for a two-state solution that divides
British-mandate Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.
   The United States has refused to deal directly with the PLO until
it recognized Israel and renounced terrorism. The United States and
Israel have said recent PLO statements are insufficient.
   ``What we aspire is Palestinian peace, not an Israeli or American
peace,'' Arafat said.
   ``We want peace that guarantees our legitimate political rights,
foremost of which our right to return, to self-determination and to
our independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.''
   The message, signed ``your brother Abu Ammar,'' Arafat's nom de
guerre, ended with a verse from the Koran, Islam's holy book, that
says patience leads to ``victory over the infidels.''
   In another development today, a planned march in honor of the
uprising at the University of Jordan in Amman turned into a
stone-throwing brawl between Palestinian and Jordanian nationalists.
At least one person was injured, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The stabbing deaths of two American
women whose bodies were found on a solitary beach shocked the 7,000
residents of this tiny, picture-postcard island in the eastern
Caribbean.
   They can't recall anything like it, and even the police chief
isn't sure when the British colony last had a murder.
   ``We are so distressed here in Anguilla,'' said Clive Smith, 43,
a construction worker and member of the Anguilla Assembly who found
the bodies on Nov. 29 while taking a morning stroll.
   ``We are not accustomed to this kind of violence, and it happened
just as tourism was booming,'' he said.
   Susan Galvin, 39, and Martha Marie Alsup, 38, both
psychotherapists from Watertown, Mass., were killed while exploring
the island in a rented jeep. Their bodies, clad in swimming suits,
were found in the desolate and rugged eastern tip of the island, an
area called Windward Point Bay.
   Hardly anyone ever goes there because it is rocky and violent,
crashing waves make it impossible to swim.
   ``When I'm not too busy I like to stroll there because it is
empty and I feel closer to God,'' said Smith.
   Police say if it hadn't been for his walk, the women's bodies
might have not been found because the strong waves could have washed
them off.
   Andy Otto, a 17-year-old local boy who was arrested the day the
women were found, was charged Wednesday with murder and robbery.
   If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of death by hanging,
because police said he would be tried as an adult.
   ``Our investigation revealed the two women died from unnatural
causes which led to the charges of murder and robbery,'' Police
Commissioner Harold Payne said. He said the women were probably
killed with a ``sharp instrument, probably a knife.''
   Although Payne said the women's jewelry was not stolen, robbery
was suspected because ``there was some money involved.'' Payne would
not elaborate.
   The women arrived in the secluded island the weekend of Nov. 26,
about three days before their bodies were found.
   Ms. Alsup, the daughter of the late Illinois congressman John
Alsup, and Ms. Galvin, originally from Columbus, Ohio, lived
together in a Watertown house they bought seven years ago. They had
separate practices.
   ``The incident has sent shockwaves throughout the local community
where a murder has not occurred in a number of years,'' wrote the
island's weekly newspaper, Vantage.
   Payne, who has been commissioner since 1976, isn't even certain
when Anguilla last had a murder. ``I think we had a crime of passion
five years ago,'' he said.
   Two Scotland Yard detectives helped in the investigation because
local police lacked experience.
   The 16-mile-long island was named Anguilla after an eel because
Columbus thought it was shaped like one when he discovered it in
1500. It has more than 30 unspoiled, white sandy beaches bordering
the aquamarine coastline of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.
   This year, Anguilla had a tourism increase of 29 percent, more
than any other Caribbean island besides Aruba, and officials hope
the killings don't scare off future tourists.
   ``Anguilla is a tranquil, peaceful island. We don't want
potential visitors to think this is a violent country because it
isn't. Here there's no need to lock your car or even your house,''
said Julian Harrigan, the Home Affairs and Tourism Commissioner.
   Connell Harrigan, owner of the 14-room beachfront Bay Shore
Resort where the two women were staying, fears that will change.
   ``I used to tell my guests Anguilla was so safe they could sleep
on the beach. I can't do that anymore,'' said Harrigan.

<TEXT>
   A maintenance company accused county
officials of using more toilet paper than they had ordered and
removed every roll from more than 100 restrooms at the courthouse.
   ``I already gave them too much,'' said Linda Ellis, co-owner of
Ellis Maintenance. ``I put it in in good faith. Their allotment does
not call for any more. I am not putting it in free of charge.''
   The company claims Los Angeles County ran up $100,000 in bills by
using more paper products than its contract calls for. Crews
Thursday night removed all the toilet paper from the bathrooms used
by courthouse employees, judges, lawyers, jurors, prisoners and
visitors.
   Hip Lui, the county's chief of contract services, says the
agreement with the maintenance company calls for all supplies needed.
   Kem Wellcome, the county's deputy director of facilities
operations services, said the company could lose its contract over
the dispute, and it owes the county for the cost of dispatching
three county employees on a toilet-paper run for the courthouse.

   Sultan Qaboos of Oman gave his civil servants
a day off on Saturday because it rained the night before in the
desert state.
   The ruler declared the national holiday for his armed forces and
thousands of other government employees after torrential rains fell
on the north coast.
   The official announcement of the holiday said it was ordered
``because of the good omen'' of the heavy rainfall throughout the
sultanate.
   Residents in the capital celebrating the holiday said the decree
also kept commuters off flooded roads.
   The average rainfall is barely four inches a year in Oman, a
Persian Gulf state with 1.5 million people located near the great
desert belt that stretches from the west coast of Africa through the

   Former Communist Party leader
Alexander Dubcek, ousted after leading a 1960s reform movement, said
today he was under house arrest during the visit of French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Dubcek told reporters police cars circled his home in the hills
overlooking Bratislava on Friday, when Mitterrand was visiting the
city, and that he could not leave home.
   Dubcek's wife, Anna, told reporters that the police were gone
today and her husband could leave the house.
   It was the first time Dubcek has been kept under such close watch
since April 1987, when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited
Czechoslovakia and routine police surveillance of the ousted
communist leader was abruptly lifted.
   Dubcek, who inspired the reform movement that was quashed when
Warsaw Pact troops marched into Prague in 1968, had been kept under
constant surveillance since he returned home in 1970 from his
five-month term as ambassador to Turkey. He was expelled from the
Communist Party and given a low-level bureaucratic job from which he
is now retired.
   During his two-day visit to Czechoslovakia that ended Friday,
Mitterrand praised the leaders of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
inspired by Dubcek, but the former communist leader did not meet the
French president.
   Last month, Dubcek was allowed to leave Czechoslovakia for the
first time in 18 years, traveling to Italy to receive an honorary
degree at Bologna University.

   Experts are examining a painting recently found in
Venezuela to determine if it is a self-portrait of the Renaissance
master Raphael.
   The painting, the property of an unidentified Venezuelan
millionaire, was sent to Italy so its origins could be investigated,
Italian press reports said.
   The work measures 19 by 14 inches and is painted on canvas, the
Italian news agency AGI reported. The Italian Ministry of Culture
named a committee to examine the painting, and the panel began its
work Friday.
   The work was spotted in Venezuela by an Italian professor, Nico
Nicosia, dean of the State Institute of Art in Urbino, Raphael's
hometown in northern Italy. Nicosia says he would like to see Italy
acquire the work.
   Raphael, whose full name was Raffaello Sanzio, lived from
1483-1520 and worked as a painter and architect. He helped in the
reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica and won fame for his fresco
work in the Vatican.

   Stealing an evergreen tree from city
property to use as a Christmas tree could cost a person a lot of
friends. The trees have been sprayed with a smelly brew of fox urine
and skunk scent.
   ``Last year was the first year we did this, and we didn't lose
any trees,'' said park foreman Larry Pruegner. ``We're hoping that
it would be successful this year. If we save even one tree, then
we've more than done our job.''
   Westminster used to lose 15 to 20 of its Colorado blue spruces
and pines a year to people who helped themselves. Replacing a tree
cost between $120 to $160, plus the cost of planting.
   But last year parks director Jerry Royther heard about the
University of Nebraska using fox urine to prevent thieves from
cutting down the trees on campus, and he asked the staff to look
into it.
   ``I thought it was hilarious,'' Pruegner said. ``But when you
think about it, it may not seem as funny as it sounds.''
   He said he decided to add the skunk scent on the advice of Rocky
Mountain Enterprises in Fort Collins, which sells it to trappers.
   ``They told me, `If you really want to make the concoction right,
put this in, it's pretty rank, too,''' he said.
   It's so rank, he warned his staff: ``You need very good rubber
gloves to prevent the stuff from getting on your hands, and be
especially attentive to how the wind is blowing.''

   A former Teamsters Union dissident who accused
union officials of violating his rights for years has been awarded
$522,000 in damages by a federal court jury.
   Arthur Doty, of Newburyport, contended in his lawsuit that he was
harassed, assaulted and threatened because of his work with a group
called Teamsters for a Democratic Union. He said he was denied his
constitutional and union rights by officials who ``engaged in a
purposeful and deliberate attempt to discourage dissent within their
unions.''
   ``I hope to God this makes Teamster officials all over the
country think twice before they start pushing around people who are
fighting for their rights,'' said Doty, 42, a Teamsters member for
nearly two decades who is no longer a member of the union.
   Friday's jury verdict included damages from Teamsters Local 42 in
Lynn and several past and present officers.
   In addition, Doty's attorney, Mark Stern, said Local 49, one of
three locals that denied Doty membership after he joined the
dissident group, agreed to pay Doty $20,000 immediately and $20,000
over the next five years and to apologize.
   Teamsters for Democratic Union group says it seeks democracy and
an end to corruption in the union.

   Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinians
today, including a 16-year-old boy who threw a firebomb at a patrol
in occupied Gaza City and an Arab prisoner who attacked a guard with
a makeshift knife, the army said.
   At least 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The 16-year-old Gaza boy, Hosni Abu Sido, was part of a gang of
youths who threw gasoline-filled bottles at soldiers patrolling Gaza
City this morning, just hours after a curfew was lifted and
residents were allowed outside, the army spokesman said.
   ``The lives of the soldiers were in danger and the commander of
the patrol opened fire,'' said the army spokesman, who is not
identified according to regulations.
   He said a soldier was lightly wounded but did not require
hospitalization.
   The prisoner killed, Abdallah Abu Mahruka, attacked a guard with
a makeshift knife while he and fellow inmates in Gaza City's Shati
prison were out on a daily walk.
   The deaths raised the number of Palestinians killed in the
year-old anti-Israeli revolt to 322. Eleven Israelis also have been
killed.
   At 11 a.m., Gaza City storekeepers closed shop and traffic stood
still for five minutes of silence in memory of the Palestinians
killed in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987.
   About 250,000 Arabs were confined to their homes in Gaza refugee
camps for the third straight day. A curfew was lifted from Gaza City
and small villages, the army spokesman said.
   All 650,000 residents of the Gaza Strip were under curfew Friday
to prevent violence surrounding the first anniversary of the
uprising.
   In a statement released today in Nicosia, Cyprus, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat called on Palestinians to escalate their uprising,
telling them: ``You are recording a new victory in the march toward
liberation with every daybreak.''
   ``As we near victory,'' Arafat said, ``we must realize that the
most ferocious and bloody confrontations occur in the last quarter
of an hour before peace.''
   He did not mention his recent peace initiatives, including
statements interpreted by some as explicit recognition of Israel's
right to exist.
   In Arab east Jerusalem today, police fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse demonstrators who threw rocks in the Arab
commercial center near the walled Old City and in an Arab village
and refugee camp, both in the city limits. There were no injuries,
police said.
   Police arrested seven girls in another clash in East Jerusalem,
which began when a police van was stoned and one of windows smashed.
   In northern Israel, arsonists caused serious damage when they set
a mosque on fire in the Israeli Arab village of Ibtin near the port
city of Haifa, Israeli radio said.
   An anonymous telephone caller told police he set the fire to
punish Ibtin residents, 10 of whom were accused last week of being
members of an anti-Israeli guerrilla squad. The suspected
guerrillas, all Israeli citizens, were accused of throwing a hand
grenade that blew the leg off a Haifa boy in July.
   Hospital officials said seven Palestinians were shot and wounded,
most of them in the legs, in the Gaza Strip today.
   Five other Palestinians were shot and wounded in the occupied
West Bank, hospital officials said. Most of the clashes reportedly
occurred near Nablus, the West Bank's largest city.
   Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank have been under
military occupation since the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel
captured the territories from Egypt and Jordan.

   Emperor Hirohito received a series of transfusions
today to control his internal bleeding and his condition remained
unstable, said a palace spokeman.
   Doctors said the 87-year-old monarch hemorrhaged heavily late
Friday and early today and they extracted blood from his upper
digestive tract through a tube, according to Imperial Household
Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
   Maeda said the emperor received about two pints of blood since
Friday night. His systolic blood pressure fell to 90 in the morning
and rose to 110 in the evening, Maeda said. A normal reading is
about 120.
   Maeda said this morning that the emperor's condition had ``not
restabilized.''
   Hirohito has received a total of about 53 pints of blood since he
became ill Sept. 19, when he started bleeding from the part of the
intestine that was operated on last year.
   Palace officials refuse to confirm or deny that the emperor has
cancer.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins
condemned South Africa's human rights record Saturday, and two U.S.
senators warned of tougher sanctions after a ``deeply
disappointing'' meeting with the president.
   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa, said in
a Human Rights Day speech that security laws ``are being used in an
ever more political manner.'' He described the policy of detention
without trial as ``one of the worst kinds of human rights abuse.''
   The other featured speaker at the Johannesburg meeting was the
Rev. Frank Chikane, a former detainee who is general-secretary of
the South African Council of Churches. Perkins has had extensive
contacts with black opposition leaders during two years in South
Africa but rarely has he shared a podium at a major public event
with a militant activist such as Chikane.
   In Cape Town, Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and David Boren, D-Okla.,
told a news conference they were pessimistic about South Africa
after completing a one-week fact-finding trip. They met numerous
government and opposition leaders.
   The senators, both influential committee chairmen, said President
P.W. Botha bluntly rejected their request to meet with imprisoned
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, one of the top
priorities of their trip.
   ``He (Botha) gave a very rapid answer _ `No, you're not.' We
repeated the question, and got the same answer,'' Boren said.
   Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, described
Tuesday's meeting with Botha as ``the deepest disappointment'' of
the trip.
   ``We came as centrists, as constructive people, hoping to talk to
the state president about the future of the country,'' Boren said.
``The state president deeply disappointed us, by wanting to talk
only about the past, not trying to engage and assess and share ideas
about the future.''
   If Botha's attitude was seen in Washington as representative of
government views, intensified economic sanctions were likely, Boren
said.
   The senators, in a prepared statement, said Botha's government
had taken some positive steps, including tentative approval of an
accord to bring independence to Namibia and release of some
political prisoners.
   ``In all candor, however, we must say that the pessimism which we
feel comes from the alarming direction currently being taken by the
government,'' the statement said.
   It cited the recent treason convictions of four anti-apartheid
leaders after a three-year trial and intensifying restrictions on
opposition activity.
   ``If those who are working for real change are foreclosed from
using non-violent political methods, it is our great fear that they
will be forced to turn to methods that will undoubtedly lead to
violence and tragedy,'' the senators said.
   Perkins last week attended the final session of the treason
trial, in which four activists received prison sentences ranging
from 6 to 12 years.
   ``Court decisions which convict genuine, non-violent community
leaders of treason and terrorism cannot be expected to command
respect,'' he said.
   One of the activists whom the senators met was Albertina Sisulu,
wife of jailed ANC leader Walter Sisulu. She is not allowed to make
public statements or engage in political activity.
   ``To be free means you can speak your mind and your conscience,''
said Boren. ``It is unbelievable to me, having met people like Mrs.
Sisulu, how any kind of government keeps a person under those
conditions.''
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, said he
would support tougher U.S. sanctions if a vote were taken now. But
he added that in respect to forcing change in South Africa, ``you
can't say sanctions have succeeded.''
   Chikane, speaking after Perkins at a Johannesburg church, read a
letter which he said was sent covertly by black detainees. It said
the government was conducting ``a concerted campaign of
disinformation'' to convince Western leaders that reform was
occurring.
   President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
``continue to buy our repression at the cheapest rate of exchange,
and we hold them equally liable for our deteriorating conditions,''
the letter said.
   Human Rights Day marks the 40th anniversary of the United
Nations' adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
South Africa abstained rather than support the document.

   Protesters demanding the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo battled riot police with firebombs and rocks
Saturday in the city center after being blocked from marching to the
presidential palace.
   Thousands of terrified people, many out for Christmas shopping,
ran for cover as hundreds of riot police and protesters battled in
the main shopping district. Authorities deployed 9,000 riot police
to block the march by about 2,000 radical students and dissidents.
   Police had no figures on arrests or injuries, but officers and
protesters were seen with blood pouring from head wounds and other
injuries. Protesters and officers caught by the other side were
brutally beaten.
   Protesters demanded the fall of Roh and the arrest of former
President Chun Doo-hwan for human rights abuses and corruption under
his authoritarian rule. Dissident leaders announced at a rally at
Myongdong Cathedral the formation of a new radical alliance to try
and topple Roh.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' protesters
chanted.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets blocked
marchers with shields as they tried to march from the cathedral to
the presidential palace. Students with iron clubs attacked police,
but were driven off with tear gas grenades.
   Hundreds of protesters then regrouped several blocks away in a
shopping district. Students attacked riot police with firebombs and
paving stones they ripped out of the sidewalks. A small group of
police was surrounded and beaten to the ground by screaming
protesters.
   Charging riot police swept protesters away several times, but
students repeatedly surged out of sidestreets to resume fighting.
Hundreds of people were trapped in vehicles as the fighting swirled
around them and police hurled tear gas grenades into subway stations.
   The protest in freezing temperatures was smaller than three major
violent protests in Seoul last month to demand Chun's arrest.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile last month after apologizing to the
nation. Several of Chun's relatives and associates have been
convicted or charged with corruption.
   Roh, another former general, asked the nation to forgive Chun and
installed a new Cabinet Nov. 28 as part of efforts to defuse the
furor. Roh is trying to distance his own administration from his
former ally.
   A small group of Buddhist monks and students clashed Saturday
with riot police at the Buddhist temple on the east coast where Chun
is staying in seclusion. Six people were injured in the clash.
   Dissident leaders announced at the rally the formation of a new
alliance to seek Chun's arrest and the overthrow of Roh. Speakers
said Chun could not be brought to justice without toppling the Roh
government.
   ``We declare that it will be possible to clarify the whole truth
of the past misdeeds and punish those responsible only when Chun and
Roh are brought to testify before investigators,'' said a
declaration by the alliance.
   The radicals and dissidents do not have wide public support, but
many South Koreans are angry over the handling of the Chun issue and
want action of some kind.
   Opposition leaders Saturday accused Roh of delaying action
against Chun and repeated demands that the former president
cooperate with the National Assembly probe of misdeeds under his
government. Chun stepped down in February.

   Transport officials Saturday
released the first photographs of wreckage of a South African
Airways jumbo jet that crashed in the Indian Ocean last year,
killing the 160 people on board.
   The photographs, clearly showing large pieces of wreckage, were
taken 13,200 feet below the surface by cameras aboard an unmanned
mini-submarine.
   The wreckage found and filmed so far includes pieces of the tail,
landing gear and engines, the transport department said.
   The Boeing 747 crashed Nov. 28, 1987, near the island nation of
Mauritius while en route from Taiwan to South Africa. It is the
worst crash in South African aviation history.
   Cecil Margo, a judge who heads the inquiry commission
investigating the cause of the crash, said after veiwing the
photographs that there seemed to be a good chance of recovering the
plane's flight data recorders.

   Someone who believes it is better to
receive than to give has stolen about $600 in Salvation Army
donations and kettles by posing as a collector for charity bell
ringers.
   ``He had all the credentials it takes'' to be a bell ringer, said
Salvation Army Lt. Nathan Johnson, head of the charity's Belleville
office. ``It's believed he was hired as bell ringer this year, and
had been hired in the past.''
   ``It saddens me, because I obviously hired the person,'' Johnson
said Friday.
   No arrests have been made.
   Bell ringers at three stores in the area east of St. Louis
reported that a man wearing a Salvation Army bell-ringer badge and
carrying a bell approached them Wednesday and told them he was there
to collect money from their kettles, Johnson said. All three workers
refused to hand over their kettles.
   But the thief succeeded at a grocery store when two women bell
ringers, following Salvation Army policy, left their kettles at the
store's customer service counter while they went to the restroom,
Johnson said.
   The impersonator showed his badge to store employees and told
them he was there to pick up the kettles. The man then fled with
kettles and money worth about $600, Johnson said.
   ``We don't hold the store in any way responsible,'' he said.
   Despite the theft, the Salvation Army's holiday campaign in the
Belleville area has collected about $54,000 of its $200,000 goal,
Johnson said.

   A lung cancer patient who lit a cigarette
while inhaling pure oxygen caused a fire that burned him and forced
evacuation of other patients at University Medical Center.
   ``We discourage patients from smoking in their room, and they
usually don't. We tell them if they must smoke, smoke with an
attendant present,'' said George de Gravelle, UMC's acting
administrator.
   Patient George Stickler, 59, of Broussard, suffered second-degree
burns on his back Friday and his bed was destroyed, said fire
inspector Robert Benoit.
   Eleven other patients on the same floor were evacuated before
hospital personnel put out the blaze with fire extinguishers. Benoit
estimated damage at $3,000.
   A state fire marshal's investigation was ordered because a
sprinkler in the patient's room didn't work when the fire started,
Benoit said.

   Things no one would know if the National
Archives didn't release a new batch of papers from Richard Nixon's
White House once in a while:
   That Ronald Reagan once considered Carla Hills, President-elect
Bush's choice to be U.S. trade representative, too liberal for a
senior federal post. That CIA director Richard Helms made points
with his boss by sending complimentary little notes, such as one
critiquing a televised speech as ``most impressive in the best
presidential tradition.'' J. Edgar Hoover did, too.
   That among the Americans who praised Nixon for his Saturday Night
Massacre of officials during the unraveling Watergate scandal were
hotel magnate J. Willard Marriott and former Milwaukee Braves
baseball manager Fred Haney. That Henry Kissinger stiffed a Cabinet
member who wanted help in getting his son a visa for China.
   And that a fifth grader got Nixon's attention with his profiles
of former presidents like ``Martian V. Buran.''
   These and other tidbits were gleaned from a comparatively modest
550,000 pages of Nixon administration files which the National
Archives opened to public view last week. Modest, in the sense that
there are 40 million in all, of which only 5 million have been made
public so far.
   No bombshells in this batch, just insights.

   On Feb. 22, 1973, Nixon wrote a former neighbor in San Clemente,
Calif., thanking her for sending along son Robbie's profiles of
former presidents. ``I shared his comments ... with some of my staff
members and we all agreed that Robbie had a most direct, no-nonsense
approach to history.''
   And what had Robbie written? ``Martian V. Buran was first
American born after the revolutionary war. Martian was a friendly
man.'' And of ``Milliard Fillmore:'' ``One day he went to school. He
had a woman teacher and after school he married his teacher.''

   Nixon's mail was full of laudatory notes from officials who owed
their jobs to him.
   One was Richard Helms, who was trying to hang onto his job as
head of the CIA. He often wrote the president after public
appearances and once sent him a package of peaches. In one of his
notes, Helms wrote:
   ``Without, I hope, being thought presumptuous, may I say how
effective I found your appearance on television last evening. You
were persuasive and constructive ... and it came over as a most
impressive performance in the best presidential tradition. It gave
even me a big lift.''
   After a Nixon speech on drugs, Helms promised that his agents
would ``bust their buttons to improve intelligence collection on the
drug traffic.''
   Helms' efforts didn't work. At the end of his first term in 1972,
Nixon replaced Helms and made him ambassador to Iran.

   In the spring of 1973, Attorney General Richard Kleindienst's
son, Alfred, was working temporarily at the U.S. consulate in Hong
Kong. He wanted to visit mainland China at a time when the United
States did not have formal diplomatic relations with that government.
   Kleindienst approached Kissinger, the wizard who had wrangled an
invitation to China for Richard Nixon. Receiving no answer from the
national security adviser, Kleindienst put his request in writing.
Kissinger's staff asked if he wanted to help or send a ``polite
turndown.''
   Kissinger chose a third route: ``Sit on it.''

   George Bush, who made the L-word a dirty word in his campaign,
intends to nominate Carla Hills to be U.S. trade representative in
his Cabinet. Bush might be interested to know that 15 years ago,
just before Nixon nominated her to be an assistant attorney general,
a White House aide wrote colleagues who were weighing the
nomination: ``Governor Reagan has cleared her for this position, but
has not endorsed her. She is considered a liberal by Reagan's
standards.''

<BYLINE>A New CIA Plot Revealed</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   From John Ehrlichman, the No. 2 aide in the White House, to
Rogers C.B. Morton, secretary of the interior. Memo, dated Feb. 21,
1972:
   ``It has been brought to the attention of the White House that
the statue in front of the Justice Department on Constitution Avenue
is actually that of Nathan Hale, who, as you know, was executed by
the British on 22 September 1776.''
   It occurred to Ehrlichman that Hale had no connection with the
Justice Department and, as more of a spook than gumshoe, he would be
more at home at the CIA.
   ``The Agency Operations Division point out that a clandestine
removal is entirely feasible and is now temporarily planned for the
dark of the moon during the month of March,'' Ehrlichman wrote.
``Workmen will be disguised as paperboys, Department of Commerce
secretaries headed home after working overtime, GSA trash removal
men and tourists. The actual removal is planned via a three-ton
truck disguised as a wholesale bread delivery van.''
   Ehrlichman said he had been empowered to let Morton in on this to
ensure that Morton's Park Police ``will not fire upon the agency
workmen during this operation. ... It is felt best if clandestine
support is given to this operation by causing blank rounds to be
issued to all Park Police.''
   There is no evidence of a reply from Morton in the Nixon files.
Nathan Hale still stands outside the Justice Department. Maybe
Morton got the joke.

   Three U.S. Army paratroopers died when
their car went off a bridge and landed upside down in a river, the
Army said Saturday.
   A fourth paratrooper, Spec. Jose Martinez of Houston, was not
injured, said an Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Frank E. Feild.
   Feild, spokesman for the Southern European Task Force in the
northern city of Vicenza, said the Army would withheld the names of
the dead.
   He said the accident occurred midnight Friday in downtown Vicenza
when the off-duty officers' car crashed through the railing of a
one-lane bridge.
   ``Initial reports indicate that the three soldiers drowned,''
Feild said, adding that an autopsy would be performed Monday.
   The Army will conduct an investigation into the accident, he said.
   All four soldiers were assigned to the Combat Support Company of
the 3rd Batallion, 325th Regiment, in Vicenza.

   The FBI has confirmed that product tampering
was to blame for the poisoning of three people who drank from
bottles of Coca-Cola laced with a deadly and outlawed rat killer,
officials said.
   ``We know now we are not looking at an accident, we are looking
at a deliberate act,'' Polk County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Hulsey
said Friday.
   One person was in critical condition and on life support
equipment.
   Officials would not discuss any possible motive in the case and
said investigators have no suspects.
   Chemical tests revealed traces of thallium sulfate, a rat poison
and toxic insecticide banned for general use in 1965, in five
bottles from which three members of one family drank on Oct. 31.
   The 16-ounce bottles were part of an eight-pack found at the home
of Peggy Carr.
   Tests performed by the FBI on the three unopened bottles also
showed traces of the toxic chemical, Hulsey said.
   Deputies said the FBI examination showed the crimped metal caps
on the three bottles had been removed and placed back on the
bottles. Authorities earlier ruled out any tampering at the bottling
plant.
   Based on the amount of thallium found in the residue in the empty
bottles, Dr. Michael Wilder, state epidemiologist, estimated each
bottle contained about half a gram of thallium. He said a gram of
thallium generally is considered a fatal dose.
   Mrs. Carr, 41, was in critical condition at Winter Haven
Hospital, unresponsive and on a respirator, authorities said.
   Stepson Travis, 16, was improved and listed as stable. Mrs.
Carr's son, Duane, also 16, was released last week.

<HEAD>Bush Proceeding Cautiously In Early Dealings With Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is proceeding cautiously in his
early dealings with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but Republican senators
say the Soviet leader's troop reduction announcement is putting
pressure on the president-elect to make a quick counterproposal.
   Six weeks from taking power, Bush already faces the problem of
how to respond to Gorbachev's dramatic declaration that he will
slash Soviet military strength by 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks in
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Gorbachev's move probably will intensify pressure in Congress for
deeper cuts in the Pentagon budget and spark demands for reductions
in American troops in Europe.
   For the moment, Bush has put the matter on the back burner,
telling Gorbachev he needs more time. ``He understood that,'' said
Bush, who still has to assemble members of his national security
team and develop priorities and strategy for his administration.
   While applauding the cutback plan, Bush said it does not compel
the United States to do anything, because it was a unilateral move
by the Kremlin.
   Even with the announced reductions, Bush said, the Soviets still
will have a big advantage in battle tanks, artillery and other
conventional arms.
   Yet, Republicans say Bush cannot let the Soviet offer go
unanswered.
   ``It's going to heighten expectations for further progress in
arms negotiations,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ``It's important
the Bush adminstration come forward with a counterproposal at the
earliest opportunity.''
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said, ``There's no doubt this will
accelerate the need for Bush to put his team together'' to formulate
strategy. ``It came at a time when President Reagan is not in a
position to make any concessions and President-elect Bush is not in
a position to make any agreements.
   ``It gives Gorbachev about six-eight weeks of pretty high-flying
propaganda,'' Cohen said.
   McCain and Cohen stressed that any counterproposal must address
the Soviet edge in conventional forces and not allow them to expand
their advantage.
   Along with President Reagan, Bush spent two hours with Gorbachev
at a luncheon Wednesday on Governors Island in New York Harbor.
Officials described the meeting as a warm encounter where neither
side pressed very hard on substantive issues.
   Throughout the year, Bush has appeared more skeptical than Reagan
about the Kremlin's intentions and Gorbachev's reforms, saying at
one point that the Cold War is not over. Bush took a different tack
last week, warmly praising the communist leader.
   ``There is no question that Mr. Gorbachev is a very different
individual from his predecessors,'' Bush said after the meeting.
``He is a warm human being, and people see that. He is committed to
change.''
   Later in the week, Reagan said Gorbachev has never shown any
reason to be mistrusted and, indeed, has guided the Kremlin away
from its old goal of a one-world communist state.
   Hard-line conservatives say Reagan is acting starry-eyed about
Gorbachev, and predict Bush will be tougher.
   ``Reagan has bought the naive point of view that somehow Mr.
Gorbachev and he can make world peace together when it is the system
we are confronting, not some particular individual, and Gorbachev
could be gone tomorrow,'' said Paul Weyrich, president of the Free
Congress Foundation.
   Departing the White House after a meeting between Reagan and
conservative hard-liners, Weyrich said, ``I don't think Mr. Bush has
any such illusions. ... I have found him much more realistic than
President Reagan.''

<HEAD>About 100 Injured In Clashes Between Rival Moslem Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fundamentalists at odds over how to
implement Islamic law clashed among themselves and attacked police
this week, killing one officer and leaving about 100 people injured,
official sources said today.
   Tension remained high among students belonging to the extremist
Moslem group known as Gamaat Islamiya and the moderate Brotherhood,
who fought Wednesday and Thursday with knives, chains and sticks,
said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In the Ein Shams district of Cairo on Thursday and Friday,
extremists attacked the police station with stones and flaming
objects, and 50 of them were taken into custody, the sources said.
   Police said today they mounted a nationwide search for an
extremist suspected in the stabbing death of police Lt. Col. Essam
Shams on Thursday in Ein Shams.
   The Interior Ministry identified the assailant as Sherif Mohammed
Sherif, 27, a clerk at a Cairo high school who belongs to the
underground group known as Jihad. The government has blamed Jihad
for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat on Oct. 6, 1981, and
a failed coup attempt two days later organized from Assiut.
   Since the clashes, security forces swept the Ein Shams district
of Cairo and detained more than 130 extremists, said the security
sources in the capital.
   The clashes started at the university in Assiut, 237 miles south
of Cairo, which for years has been a center of Moslem extremist
activity.
   Followers of Brotherhood and Gamaat have been feuding for months
over religious differences such as which side should be allowed to
deliver sermons in the mosques.
   Both moderates and extremists support implementation of Sharia,
the Islamic legal and ethical code that was introduced about 14
centuries ago in the Moslem holy book, the Koran.
   Extremists advocate using violence, if necessary, in support of
the Moslem laws, while the Brotherhood says it is in favor of
peaceful action. The government contends more than 90 percent of
Egyptian laws already conform to the laws of Islam.

   President Reagan got a clean bill of health
from his physicians today, who reported that lab tests of tissue
taken from his colon show him to be free of cancer, the White House
said.
   ``The tissue removed Friday afternoon from President Reagan's
colon for biopsy is benign,'' said a statement issued by
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``No further examinations
or tests are required. The president is in excellent health.''
   The statement added that the small amount of tissue taken from
the president was ``a benign adenomatous polyp,'' a type of growth
that is often found in men the president's age.
   On Friday, first lady Nancy Reagan was told her latest breast
X-ray showed ``no evidence of cancer of any kind.''
   The couple, both of whom have battled cancer while in the White
House, spent more than four hours Friday at Bethesda Naval Hospital
for annual physicals and cancer checkups.
   Departing the hospital for the a weekend at Camp David., the
president and his wife both smiled and gave ``thumbs-up'' signs.
Reagan sported a pair of blue running shoes for tests that required
him to walk a treadmill. He called out, ``clean bill of health'' to
reporters as he left the hospital.
   Col. John Hutton, the president's physician, said doctors removed
a ``small piece of tissue'' from Reagan's colon and that it
``appeared to be benign,'' or non-cancerous.
   The tissue, which was to be tested over the weekend, ``resembled
a small adenomatous polyp'' and was ``removed because it was
suspicious,'' Hutton said.
   There are several kinds of benign growths that can occur in the
colon, and they generally are divided into two types _ hyperplastic
or adenomatous polyps. Hyperplastic polyps usually are not thought
to be associated with cancers elsewhere in the colon, while
adenomatous polyps are a signal to be on guard for future growths.
   Reagan's doctors have told him that he will need periodic colon
tests for the remainder of his life.
   Hutton declared Reagan to be ``in excellent health ... in
remarkable physical condition.''
   The president has had polyps removed from his intestine in four
of five colonoscopic exams he has had since a two-inch cancerous
lesion was removed from his colon in July 1985.
   The relatively small polyps such as those taken in the past from
Reagan tend to occur more frequently as people grow older. The
growths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left alone, can
become cancerous.
   The colonoscopy was performed without sedation of any kind,
Hutton said in a statement. The examination involves the use of a
long, flexible scope that is inserted into the bowel. If a polyp is
found, the physician can use a tiny wire loop at the end of the
scope to snare the growth and clip it off. The wound is sealed with
an electrical current that runs through the instrument.
   The statement added that the president's chest X-ray was clear,
that his urine sample was normal, and that there was ``no clinically
significant change'' in his pulmonary condition.
   ``The stress test and electrocardiogram showed the president's
cardiovascular system is unchanged and normal,'' it said.
   Reagan's CAT-scan, the computerized three-dimensional X-ray of
his internal organs, showed no internal abdominal abnormalities. The
test checks against the spread of cancer to other vital organs in
that region of the body, such as the stomach or liver.
   Mrs. Reagan, 67, had her second breast X-ray, or mammogram, since
her cancerous left breast was removed in October 1987. Hutton said
the exam ``showed no evidence of cancer of any kind. Physical
examination showed her condition was normal.''
   Earlier Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Reagan has received a positive report from his dermatologists, who
examined him at the White House on Thursday and pronounced him free
of any new skin cancers.
   Reagan had skin cancers removed from his face in August 1985 and
July 1987.

<HEAD>Star Wars' Civilian Benefits Largely Illusory, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The promise that Star Wars research will spin
off beneficial civilian technology appears largely illusory and
continued heavy spending on the space-based missile defense system
could damage America's economic well-being, a private study
concludes.
   The military goals of President Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative are so fixed that the plan ``is unlikely to produce
significant commercial spinoffs'' despite a huge investment of U.S.
resources, says a report by the Council on Economic Priorities.
   ``Proponents of the Reagan administration's SDI are positioning
the program not only as a `technological fix' for the arms race but
an economic cure-all as well _ a 21st century `industrial
revolution' that will put America securely ahead of its economic
competitors,'' says the report.
   It said a one-year council study ``finds that whatever commercial
spinoffs result from SDI, they are unlikely to be substantial in
relation to the cost of the program.
   ``And while the United States pursues technology development
indirectly through SDI, the Europeans and Japanese pursue it
directly through sophisticated government-industry ventures.
   ``President-elect George Bush's campaign promise to continue
funding for SDI research and development bodes ill for the nation's
shaky competitive position in the world economy.''
   The Defense Department, in a written response, dismissed the new
council study as ``fundamentally flawed'' and said the Pentagon had
never sought to justify Star Wars research with the promise of
substantial commercial spinoffs.
   The Reagan administration is spending $4.1 billion during the
coming year on Star Wars, a research effort aimed at developing
lasers and other exotic weapons that could be used automatically to
shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the United States or its allies.
   The Council on Economic Priorities, based in New York, describes
itself as public interest research organization specializing in
studies of national security issues, the environment and corporate
social responsibility. It has conducted numerous studies involving
Star Wars over the past several years, almost all of them critical.
   The council's latest study concludes that between fiscal 1983 and
fiscal 1989, ``SDI took up 22 percent of the increase in federally
funded research and development, 11 percent of national research and
development and 26 percent of Defense Department research and
development.''
   ``There is no doubt that the massive infusion of research and
development funds for SDI will lead to some civilian spinoffs,'' the
report said.
   ``The key question is not whether SDI will produce spinoffs, but
rather how cost-effective these spinoffs will be.''
   The council said Star Wars is unlikely to produce many commercial
innovations because of an emphasis on hardware development instead
of basic research and reliance on a few large defense contractors
instead of ``cost-conscious entrepreneurs.''
   The report said scientists working on Star Wars probably would be
reluctant to transfer technology to the civilian sector because
their careers depend on the defense sector.
   Indeed, it said, Star Wars research could cause a ``brain drain''
of top-flight researchers from work on civilian goods and services.
   The Pentagon statement said Star Wars already had produced some
commercial innovations, but these benefits were a byproduct and not
the primary reason for the program.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is under mounting pressure
from its people, political parties, army and Western aid donors to
end a debilitating civil war and to begin fighting the famine and
economic ruin it has caused.
   Hesitant steps toward peace have been taken, mainly a provisional
peace pact signed Nov. 16 by the rebels and the Democratic Unionist
Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's
governing coalition.
   But critics accuse el-Mahdi of dragging his feet in a ploy to
ensure the Democratic Unionists cannot claim credit for restoring
peace.
   The provisional pact relaxed tensions to the point where the Red
Cross and the United Nations were able to begin emergency airlifts
Dec. 4 with guarantees from both sides that planes would not be
fired on.
   The planes are taking food and medicine to hundreds of thousands
of victims of war-induced famine, blamed by U.N. officials for more
than 500,000 deaths this year.
   ``Thousands of people died during the long months of
negotiations,'' said Pierre Pont, Khartoum representative of the
International Committee of the Red Cross. ``I think both sides
finally decided it was politically futile to continue to stop and
impede the relief.''
   El-Mahdi has been getting a lot of political heat in the three
weeks since John Garang, head of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army, signed the agreement that among other things calls for an
immediate cease-fire.
   The prime minister's Umma Party gave its support to the plan, but
el-Mahdi has not presented it for Cabinet consideration. The
third-largest party, the fundamentalist National Islamic Front,
strongly objects to a key provision _ freezing implementation of
harsh punishments under Sudan's Islamic law and stopping discussions
about a replacement penal code.
   The Islamic party would be certain to leave the coalition if the
Umma and Democratic Unionists joined with southern ministers to
approve the plan. That most likely would bring down the government.
   ``Once again, (el-Mahdi) may be pursuing incompatible
objectives,'' said one Western diplomat. ``Peace is clearly a
popular demand, and the (Islamic Front) is the only group critical
of peace.''
   Garang began his civil rebellion in early 1983 to press demands
for what he considers fairer economic, political and administrative
treatment for southern Sudan.
   Most people in the region are ethnic African Christians or
animists, but the national government is dominated by Arab-descended
Moslems. Garang has vowed not to stop fighting until Islamic law,
decreed several months after he took up arms, is abrogated.
   Diplomats say guns generally have fallen silent since the Nov. 16
pact, even though the agreement is not being implemented officially.
   The prospect of peace is a hugely popular idea for the common
Sudanese.
   The government was spending $1 million a day before the de facto
cease-fire took effect, a drain that ruined an already shaky
economy. The Sudanese feel the drain daily in shortages of food and
basic supplies, soaring prices and frequent shutdowns of public
utilities.
   Thousands turned out to greet the Democratic Unionists' spiritual
leader, Mohammed Osman al-Mirghani, when he returned from Ethiopia
after negotiating the agreement.
   Last week, the Union of Sudanese Writers organized a ``peace
night'' in Khartoum at which al-Mirghani and others spoke.
   On a different level, the United States and other aid donors are
applying political pressure on el-Mahdi's government.
   At a meeting of Western donors last month to discuss financing a
$407-million plan to help Sudan recover from major floods in August,
the United States essentially told Khartoum to make peace first _
and urged other donors to take the same position.
   ``Reconstruction of the country while a ruinous civil war
prevails is unimaginable,'' said John Koehring, Khartoum chief of
the U.S. Agency for International Development and Washington's
representative at the meeting. ``For this reason, the U.S.
government is not in a position to ... pledge new assistance to the
reconstruction effort.''
   The donors ended up promising Sudan $300 million.
   One diplomat from a donor country estimated that 90 percent of
Sudan's people, most political parties and the army clearly want to
see the preliminary agreement end in a real cease-fire and peace
talks.
   The army has manifested its support in several ways.
   Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Hamed Khalil strongly endorsed the
agreement on behalf of the military, and the army was reported to
have devised a plan for implementing the cease-fire once it is
declared officially. Khalil is tapped to join Foreign Minister
Hussein Suleiman Abu-Salih as co-head of the negotiating committee,
which was to have flown to Addis Ababa on Wednesday.
   The delegation didn't go. There were reports that Garang's people
had signaled Khartoum that its negotiators were not welcome if they
came without Cabinet endorsement of the peace plan.

<HEAD>US Sends Plane To Stricken Armenia With Relief Supplies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, The team, with 4 grafs to update with Bush
visit to USSR embassy.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

   A team of 26 American disaster relief
specialists left for earthquake-stricken Soviet Armenia early this
morning with a planeload of supplies and eight dogs trained to find
live victims in the rubble.
   ``This is a special opportunity for us to reach out and work with
the Soviet Union,'' said Julia Taft, head of the Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance of the State Department's Agency for
International Development.
   Mrs. Taft was head of a team that included nine doctors, among
them Robert Gale, the Los Angeles physician who helped treat victims
of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union.
   Team members boarded a heavily loaded chartered 727 which lifted
off from Dulles International Airport at 3:30 a.m. EST. It was
scheduled to refuel in Newfoundland and Ireland before completing
the scheduled 13-hour flight to Yerevan, capital of Soviet Armenia.
   Meanwhile, President-elect Bush paid a visit to the Soviet
Embassy this morning, signing a book of condolences for earthquake
victims.
   ``With anguish in our hearts for all those in the Soviet Union
who lost their loved ones,'' Bush wrote in the book. The vice
president was accompanied by his wife, Barbara, and by Brent
Scowcroft, whom he has named to be his national security adviser.
   The relief team members, most of them veterans of major disaster
relief efforts, expressed little fear of entering an unfamiliar
corner of the world where tens of thousands of people have perished
in one of the worst earthquakes of the century.
   ``I have experience with disasters, experience with Soviet
disasters,'' said Gale, predicting that political complications in
Armenia would be less than those surrounding Chernobyl, which
involved the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor.
   ``I feel pretty confident that we know what we are getting into.
Training is the key to the whole thing,'' said Steve McConaughy, a
member of the canine team along with his wife, Carol. The couple is
from Brookeville, Md., and the pair are going to Armenia with their
black Newfoundland dogs, Ebony and Shasta.
   The American party included Louise Simone, executive vice
president of the Armenian General Benevolent Fund based in Saddle
Brook, N.J., and two doctors affiliated with the charitable society,
Garo Tertzakian and Vartkes Najarian, both of Los Angeles.
   ``For us, this is a long-term prospect to rebuild Armenia,'' said
Mrs. Simone, of New York City.
   Her foundation is raising millions of dollars to send medicine
and other relief supplies to Armenia.
   Soviet diplomats met with State Department officials late Friday
afternoon to make arrangements for sending the chartered plane, U.S.
and Russian spokesmen said.
   The operation marks the first large-scale U.S. government
assistance to Soviet Union in the post-World War II era. The two
countries were allies during the war.
   The flight and many members of the team started from New York's
Kennedy airport, and the team added more members and the bulk of the
supplies at the later stop at Dulles.
   The dogs will be used to help find possible survivors in the
rubble left by the massive earthquake, which Soviet authorities
estimated had killed at least 40,000 people.
   The U.S. government offered to help Thursday but received no
response until late Friday afternoon when Yevgeny Kutovoi,
minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy, met at the State
Department with Mrs. Taft.
   Kutovoi, at a news conference, read a long list of goods, largely
medical supplies, that are urgently needed in Armenia.
   ``We are ready to receive medicines and medical equipment
(syringes, medication, etc.) blood transfusion systems, medical and
other equipment for rebuilding hospitals, outpatient clinics,
kindergartens, nurseries, tents, blankets, clothing,'' he said.
   ``Cargo-carrying planes, including military transport aircraft,
may fly directly to Yerevan,'' he said. ``We are receiving those
donations with gratitude. We did not request it. We received offers
of aid.''
   Kutovoi said Soviet doctors had rushed to the stricken area, and
that foreign medical specialists were not needed immediately.
   The Soviet government has established two special bank accounts
for gifts and special teams of French and British dogs were already
in Yerevan helping search the rubble for survivors, he said.
   One bank account was at the Dupont Circle Branch of the Riggs
National Bank, 1913 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.,
20036. The name of the account is ``Earthquake Relief Fund,'' and
the account number is 04-08-572-564.
   The Soviet Vnesheconbank in Moscow has also established a fund
for wire transfers. That account number is 70-000-412, said Kutovoi.
   The American Red Cross reported that money, antibiotics and kits
used to draw blood are being collected and the Soviet Embassy said
it was deluged with telephone calls.
   ``The phones are ringing constantly as people call to express
their condolences,'' embassy press counselor Igor Bulay said.
``There is a stream of donations. People are walking up to the doors
of the embassy with checks and money orders. Checks are beginning to
come in the mail. A lot of people are calling to ask how to make
donations.''
   The embassy plans to set up a special telephone line to handle
the calls, but has not yet established the number, said Kutovoi.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Terry Gautier said her organization was
making arrangements with major pharmaceutical firms to supply
antibiotics and was collecting money to aid quake victims. Emigre
Armenians are contributing heavily, she said.
   U.S. officials also are collecting ``blood packs'' for shipment
to the Soviet Union, she said.
   The American Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for
people to call to offer assistance. The number is 1-800-453-9000.
Americans also can make donations to local Red Cross chapters,
marked for the Soviet Armenian Earthquake Relief, or through various
Armenian groups.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Appears To Be Bracing For Criticism Over Reagan
Budget</HEAD>

   Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos appears
to be bracing for criticism over cuts in school support when
President Reagan presents Congress with his final budget next month.
   Cavazos, who promised at his confirmation hearing to fight for
``the best funding possible,'' now says only ``I did the best I
could'' in arguing for education money.
   He did not disclose any figures for his department, but Office of
Management and Budget officials have said they cut $35 billion
across the government to hold the deficit to $100 billion in
Reagan's lame-duck blueprint for fiscal year 1990.
   Cavazos, the junior member of Reagan's Cabinet and one of the
holdovers who will serve in President-elect Bush's Cabinet, was
asked in an interview with The Associated Press if the budget will
reflect his principles.
   The former Texas Tech University president hesitated then
replied, ``I really don't know how to answer that. And I'm honest
about that. I did the best I could. That's all I can tell you. ...
That's going to be the budget and that's the one that I will
defend.''
   Cavazos said it is too soon to talk about what shape the budget
will take in the Bush administration, or what programs he will
launch to combat such problems as illiteracy and the steep dropout
rate.
   However, Bush did make several detailed campaign proposals to
boost education spending, including a new $500 million ``Merit
Schools'' program to help the disadvantaged and $50 million for
magnet schools.
   Cavazos told the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee at
his Sept. 9 confirmation hearing, ``I can promise this committee and
promise this nation that I will do everything I can to get the best
funding possible for our Department of Education.''
   In the interview, Cavazos, a former medical school dean who was
sworn in to Reagan's Cabinet barely 12 weeks ago, said, ``Some
people have been concerned that I've not come up with specific
programs on how to do that or do the other. I think it's premature
very frankly.
   ``I've said to people, `Look, I work for President Reagan until
noon on Jan. 20. And I will bring all of my skill, my energies and
my commitment to that presidency. I signed on for that,'' he said.
   ``But I'm also a holdover,'' he added. In the Bush administration
``we will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs.''
   Cavazos, the first Hispanic to serve in the Cabinet, has cut
quite a different figure than his brash predecessor, William J.
Bennett, who made headlines with pungent criticism of teacher unions
and others running America's schools and colleges.
   Cavazos has sought to mend fences with those same groups and to
enlist them in what he hopes will be a national effort of
unprecedented scope to educate every child to his or her fullest
potential.
   ``I really do believe that we are starting to come together,'' he
said. ``The real change, meaningful change, comes about from
bringing people together on these issues.''
   ``I think that those battles that you win by logic, by
discussion, by building a consensus, will in the long run be of more
substance'' than those won by ``pounding on the desk or raising
Cain,'' he said.
   Asked if he shared Bush's desire to bring ``fresh faces'' to
government, Cavazos said, ``Absolutely. We'll have 90 percent
turnover'' in the top ranks at the Department of Education.
   Cavazos said he thinks the public has not yet taken to heart the
severity of problems in its schools, despite the alarms sounded in
the 1983 ``A Nation At Risk'' report.
   ``Although we have made some advancements, we've fallen back in
some other areas'' since then, Cavazos said. ``We have not been able
to stem the tide of dropouts. Our literacy numbers are terrible.''
   The American people ``must not recognize the seriousness of the
problem or else they'd have gone out and done something about it,''
said Cavazos, son of a foreman on the King Ranch, one of the biggest
cattle-raising operations in Texas.
   What makes Cavazos think that he will succeed in solving these
problems where others have fallen short?
   ``I think that persistence has a lot to say about it. You just
continue bringing it forth until finally it reaches the national
consciousness,'' he said. ``Just keep pushing. Persistence.''

   As the army struggles daily to put down the
Palestinian uprising, a government-financed advertising campaign is
inviting Israelis to settle in the heart of territory caught up in
the revolt.
   Commercials with catchy jingles appear regularly on Israeli
television urging viewers to ``come enjoy the quality of life'' in
the occupied Gaza Strip, where 2,500 Jews live in 15 settlements
that are surrounded by more than 650,000 Palestinians.
   ``This isn't a place people usually come to visit,'' said Datya
Herskovitz, a settlement coordinator for the Gush Katif region in
southern Gaza. ``We're just offering to show people what's really
happening here.''
   The upbeat advertising campaign, which features cheerful theme
music and children playing soccer in tidy neighborhoods, portrays
the settler enclaves as wholesome places to raise a family. ``Live
in a young effervescent community,'' says one newspaper ad.
   The ads don't mention the year-old uprising, which has claimed
the lives of more than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis.
   ``We're not trying to ignore reality,'' Ms. Herskovitz said in an
interview. ``We just want people to take a different look at Gaza.''
   The 25-mile-long stretch of desert has been a focal point of
anti-Israeli violence since the uprising began in Gaza's refugee
camps last December.
   Jewish settlers have demanded more protection from Israel's army
against Arab stone-throwers. Thirty-one civilians in Gaza have been
wounded in stone-throwing attacks since the start of the uprising.
   Ms. Herskovitz said the long-term goal of the $50,000 promotional
drive is to help boost the territory's outnumbered Jewish population
from 3,000 to 30,000 during the next 10 years.
   The ads, placed by the government and private agencies, are part
of an annual campaign to increase settlement in the occupied land,
with this year's effort focused on Gaza.
   Some backers of the ad campaign admit it isn't easy to sell the
idea of moving to Gaza during the uprising.
   Eli Kubasi, a spokesman for the World Zionist Organization, said
settlement leaders who hope for a Jewish population boom in Gaza
during the uprising have ``set their expectations too high.''
   ``Things were easier before the intefadeh,'' Kubasi said, using
the Arabic word for uprising. ``Now people think twice about whether
they want to live there.''
   Dedi Zucker, a leader of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement,
said encouraging more settlers could undermine future efforts to
exchange portions of the occupied territories for a peace agreement
with Israel's Arab enemies.
   The United States also has called the 130 settlements in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip obstacles to peace.
   The settlements in the West Bank, some almost commuter suburbs,
are far more popular than those in Gaza, which are far from Israel's
main population centers.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war. Prior to the war,
Palestinians fleeing Israel flocked to Gaza's overcrowded refugee
camps.
   The Israeli government built the first settlements in southern
Gaza in 1967 as a buffer against the Egyptian border and ongoing
Palestinian attacks. Other enclaves and a beach resort for settlers
have been put up since.
   Few settlements have been built in the past four years because
the left-leaning Labor Party and right-wing Likud bloc, which make
up the current joint government, disagree on settlement policies and
were unwilling to provide funds.
   Zucker said the ad campaign was ``totally unrealistic'' and a
waste of government funding that could be put to better use within
Israel's pre-1967 borders.
   ``It's difficult to understand why anyone would want to live in
the middle of all that craziness,'' Zucker said in an interview. ``I
guess we'll have to wait to see how many lunatics there are.''
   But Ms. Herskovitz, the settlement coordinator, said the Gaza
settlements would grow despite the uprising.
   ``We decided this was the time to go on TV because we're ready
for more people,'' she said. ``The sole purpose of this is to bring
more families to live with us.''

   A private foundation will give $16.7 million in
AIDS grants to organizations in 25 states, including a project to
provide foster care in Kansas for AIDS-infected infants from New
York and California.
   Fifty-four projects in 25 states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia will receive amounts ranging from about $5,000 to more than
$1.8 million, said the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton,
N.J.
   The grants will be formally announced Monday.
   A $70,185 grant will go to a Salvation Army program in which
infected infants from areas with high incidence of AIDS will be
placed with foster families in Wichita, Kan. It is often difficult
to find foster care for infected infants within high-incidence
communities, leaving them unnecessarily hospitalized, the Johnson
foundation said.
   Girls Clubs of America, Inc., will receive $211,975 to develop a
guide and education materials for member clubs to use in educating
girls about risks of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Other money will go for giving AIDS education and medical care to
homeless people in Los Angeles, promoting AIDS prevention among
migrant and seasonal farm workers in Delaware, Maryland and
Virginia, and training 240 teen-agers in Chicago to educate peers
about AIDS.
   Additional grants will support AIDS education for 1,300 youths in
runaway shelters in southeastern states, free legal services for
AIDS patients in New York hospitals, and a California study of
techniques to encourage condom use.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Reagan is Cancer-Free and in `Excellent' Shape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Doctors pronounced President Reagan cancer-free
and ``in excellent health'' Saturday after laboratory tests on a
polyp removed from his colon, the White House reported.
   ``No further examinations or tests are required. The president is
in excellent health,'' said the statement issued by presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The 77-year-old president was spending the weekend resting at his
mountain retreat at Camp David, Md., with his wife, Nancy. He was
informed of the final results by his physician, Col. John Hutton.
   ``The tissue removed Friday afternoon from President Reagan's
colon for biopsy is benign,'' the statement said.
   It identified the small amount of tissue taken from the president
as ``a benign adenomatous polyp,'' a type of growth that is often
found in men of Reagan's age.
   The president and Mrs. Reagan traveled to Bethesda Naval Medical
Center in suburban Maryland for their annual physical examinations
Friday afternoon, and for routine checks intended to detect any
recurrence of their past cancers.
   The president had a two-inch cancerous lesion removed from his
colon in July 1985. The first lady had her left breast removed last
year after a quarter-inch malignancy was discovered.
   Mrs. Reagan, 67, was told Friday that her second breast X-ray
since that surgery revealed ``no evidence of cancer of any kind.''
   Leaving the hospital after a four-hour visit, the president and
his wife both smiled and gave thumbs-up signs, and Reagan called out
``clean bill of health'' to reporters. He still wore a pair of blue
running shoes for stress tolerance tests that required him to walk a
treadmill.
   Shortly after the tests, Hutton said in a statement that doctors
had removed a ``small piece of tissue'' from Reagan's colon and that
it ``appeared to be benign'' or non-cancerous but was removed
because it was ``suspicious.''
   There are several kinds of benign growths that can occur in the
colon, and they generally are divided into two types _ hyperplastic
or adenomatous polyps. Hyperplastic polyps usually are not thought
to be associated with cancers elsewhere in the colon, while
adenomatous polyps are a signal to be on guard for future growths.
   Reagan's doctors have told him that he will need periodic colon
tests for the rest of his life.
   The president has had polyps removed from his intestine in four
of five colonoscopic exams since the cancerous lesion was removed
from his colon three years ago. These small polyps tend to occur
more frequently as people grow older, and can become cancerous if
left alone.
   Hutton said the colonoscopy was performed without sedation.
   This technique involves use of a long, flexible scope that is
inserted into the bowel. If a polyp is found, the physician can use
a tiny wire loop at the end of the scope to snare the growth and
clip it off. The wound is sealed with an electrical current
delivered by the instrument.
   The statement said the president's chest X-ray was clear, his
urine sample was normal and there was ``no clinically significant
change'' in his pulmonary condition.
   ``The stress test and electrocardiogram showed the president's
cardiovascular system is unchanged and normal,'' it said.
   Reagan's CAT-scan, the computerized three-dimensional X-ray of
his internal organs, showed no internal abdominal abnormalities. The
test checks against the spread of cancer to other vital organs such
as the stomach or liver.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, given from the presidential retreat at Camp David,
Md.:
   My fellow Americans, on Wednesday this week I met with Soviet
President Gorbachev for the fifth time. Together we stood under the
gaze of Lady Liberty speaking of the prospects of peace for the
peoples of our two nations and for all the world.
   Yes, since our first summit in Geneva three years ago, we've
traveled a great journey that has seen remarkable progress; a
journey we continue to travel together.
   I'm pleased that the Soviet Union has accepted our offer of
humanitarian aid in the wake of their devastating earthquake tragedy.
   This has also been a period of important change inside the Soviet
Union. The greater openness permitted by Moscow can be found in
films, art and literature. There's greater tolerance for those
seeking to peacefully assemble and the official press carries more
independent opinions and factual reporting.
   And just a few years ago, who would have anticipated seeing a
Soviet Leader stand before the world community heralding a plan for
economic restructuring and military redeployments and promising to
meet the world community's highest standards of human rights.
   If this vision is realized and these promises are turned into
deeds, we would be witnessing a dramatic change in the Soviet
system. A long awaited break with the past and the opening of a new
era in international affairs.
   Certainly the Soviet reforms have their limits, and brave
dissenters within that country who have sought a fuller measure of
openness continue to be dealt with harshly. But I was encouraged by
the new promises of reform that Mr. Gorbachev made before the United
Nations, and hope to see these and past promises translated into
permanent institutional changes that will signal to the peoples of
the Soviet Union and the world a courageous commitment to a new path
of democratization.
   We already see unprecedented diversity in Eastern Europe, with
some countries pursuing reforms that go even beyond the Soviet
example, while other countries continue to lag behind. We hope to
see the day when all countries of Eastern Europe enjoy the freedom,
democracy and self-determination that their peoples have long
awaited.
   Just a decade ago, some intellectuals widely predicted what they
called convergence, the idea that the democratic world and the
communist world would merge into one hybrid system. The main
question amounted to how much freedom would democratic nations have
to give up in the bargain. But instead, the free world held firm to
its democratic values, cleaving to truths deeply rooted in Western
culture and our Judeo-Christian tradition.
   Moreover we spoke openly of the moral superiority of our ideal of
freedom. We candidly criticized the violations of human rights
occurring behind the iron curtain. We rebuilt our defenses and with
our allies, worked to counter international aggression by our
totalitarian adversaries, and we exhibited that scarcest of
commodities, patience.
   And our steadfastness, our policies, our whole approach has born
fruit. Perhaps the most dramatic achievement came one year ago when
Mr. Gorbachev and I signed the historic INF treaty to eliminate an
entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles.
   Next week, the Prime Ministers of two of our key NATO allies _
Turkey and Italy _ will visit Washington. And, certainly, along with
other issues, we plan to discuss this week's visit by Mr. Gorbachev,
and the strategic situation in Europe.
   For some time now, the Soviet block has had overwhelming
superiority in conventional forces in Europe. So, we welcome the
Soviet force reductions that are promised. But, let's remember this
_ even after these redeployments are completed in 1991, the Warsaw
Pact will still have a large conventional advantage _ an edge of
about five to two in tanks and artillery _ and some 300,000 more
troops.
   These unilateral reductions would, however, give a long awaited
encouragement for our efforts to achieve the genuine balance in
conventional forces that would assure greater security and stability
in Europe.
   Well, in these brightest of times, let us recall that in the
darkest days of World War II, when hopes for the free world seemed
most bleak, Winston Churchill rallied us to carry on, saying that,
``we have not journeyed all this way because we are made of sugar
candy.''
   By summoning all their strength and courage, and by pulling
together, the Allies prevailed. The war was won.
   The decades following World War II were filled with political
tensions and threats to world freedom. But in recent years, we've
seen hopes for a free and peaceful future restored, and the chance
for a new US-Soviet relationship emerge.
   To the American people and to our allies, I would echo Churchill
and say, ``We have not come this far through lack of strength, or
any weakness in our resolve. Nor has there been anything inevitable
about what we've achieved. The unity, confidence, power, and
firmness of the democracies has brought us forward. And maintaining
a strong alliance will keep us moving forward.''
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   Police attacked hundreds of people with
electric prods and rubber batons Saturday to prevent them from
holding a march to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
   Several dozen people were reported injured, including Rafaela
Guanes de Laino, wife of arrested opposition leader Domingo Laino;
and Ilde Silvero, director of the Roman Catholic weekly publication
Sendero.
   Several demonstrators were arrested.
   Police prevented people from entering the national cathedral,
where a pre-march Mass was celebrated at noon, and dispersed a crowd
of 300 at the office of the United Nations. The groups were to have
marched between the two buildings in downtown Asuncion, which was
packed with shoppers.
   When about 700 people gathered again at the U.N. office, security
forces waded into the crowd and beat demonstrators and shoppers.
   The incident quickly turned into a demonstration against the
president, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. The government had banned the
march, saying it was intended as an anti-Stroessner protest.
   ``The military dictatorship is going to fall!'' the demonstrators
chanted. ``The people, united, can never be defeated!''
   Small groups of protesters gathered at streetcorners, chanting
anti-government slogans and then dispersing before police could
attack them.
   ``We should keep fighting for the effectiveness and respect of
human rights in Paraguay, within the framework of non-violence,''
Carlos Romero Pereira, a leader of dissidents within the governing
Colorado Party, said in front of the ABC-Color newspaper building.
The paper was closed by the government in 1984.
   Euclides Acevedo, president of the opposition Revolutionary
Febrerista Party, said the repression of the marchers reflected
Paraguay's ``prehistoric state of authoritarianism'' under
Stroessner's 34-year rule.
   The march was organized by groups representing students, unions,
churches and opposition political parties.
   The universal declaration, adopted without dissent by the General
Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic U.N. document under which
member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolish
torture and slavery.

   President Reagan, by seeking accommodation with
America's principal world adversary, encouraged _ but did not bring
about _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform in the Soviet Union, experts
say.
   It was the basket-case Soviet economy, rather than a change in
Reagan's unstintingly harsh rhetoric after his first term, that
impelled the changes brought about by Gorbachev since early 1985,
these experts said.
   Reagan talked very tough about the Soviet Union from 1981 through
1984, at least in part to build on his perceived election mandate to
rebuild America's defenses.
   Several scholars and analysts said in interviews, however, that
Reagan should now be applauded for recognizing the opportunity
afforded by Gorbachev's policies.
   Reagan, they said, moved quickly to re-establish the kind of
working U.S.-Soviet relationship that had been virtually scrapped
after the Red Army's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
   For his part, Reagan said last week that he wasn't trying to take
credit for Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``I cannot, tonight, attempt to put all these events in
perspective, or still less, to claim credit for any person or
administration,'' the president told reporters Thursday at perhaps
his final news conference.
   Yet, Reagan, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, took some
credit for the changed U.S.-Soviet relationship, saying, ``Our
steadfastness, our policies, our whole approach has borne fruit.''
   The president pointed to his administration's adherence to
democratic values, its criticism of human rights violations in the
Soviet Union, and its military buildup for helping bring about the
changes.
   Reagan never met with a Soviet leader until he and Gorbachev sat
down in Geneva in November 1985. After that, they held four more,
including the turbulent talks in Reykjavik, Iceland in October 1986,
along with summits in Washington, Moscow and Wednesday's luncheon
summit on Governors Island in New York Harbor.
   Paul Weyrich, chairman of the Free Congress Educational and
Research Foundation, a strategic affairs analyst and one of Reagan's
longtime conservative backers, charged that the president had been
overcome by sentiment in his dealings with Gorbachev.
   ``Originally, I thought the administration ws dealing with the
Soviets through strength, but now we have a president who actually
believes, probably influenced by Nancy (Reagan) and others, that he
can actually make peace with Gorbachev, as if Gorbachev were an
individual, popularly elected, like himself, and not a part of a
(different) system,'' Weyrich said.
   ``Gorbachev could be replaced tomorrow, and there we would be,
holding the bag,'' he said.
   ``I think the major accomplishment of Ronald Reagan is not so
much having affected Soviet policy in significant ways, but
basically that he, in his person, has made arms control and
negotiating with the Soviets legitimate again, especially with
regard to the (conservative) right,'' said Neil McFarlane, an
associate professor in the Government and Foreign Affairs Department
at the University of Virginia.
   McFarlane said that Gorbachev's moves were to some extent spurred
by U.S. policies, particularly American assistance to the rebels
fighting the Soviet-imposed government in Afghanistan, where the
Soviets now are withdrawing their forces.
   But he said for the most part U.S. actions ``have been more or
less incidental'' to changes in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev quickly
recognized that the Soviet Union wouldn't survive as a world power
if it did not correct problems in the economy, he said.
   Raymond L. Garthoff, a senior fellow at the liberal-oriented
Brookings Institution, said, ``I think he (Reagan) should be given
credit for recognizing change on the Soviet side, but certainly that
change hasn't been determined by the hard policies he pursued during
his first term.''
   Alexander Dollin, a professor at Stanford University's Center for
Russian and East European Studies, said, ``As I see it, the reasons
why Gorbachev came to power and followed a reform program at home
and abroad had nothing to do with Ronald Reagan.''
   ``If another (Leonid) Brezhnev had come to power instead of a
Gorbachev, things would have been very different, and the Reagan
administration would have had nothing to take credit for,'' he said.
   Bill Taylor, vice president for political and military affairs at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said during the
Reagan years, the Soviets ``at least rhetorically have made
changes.'' But he said that ``his orians may only tell years from
now'' what impact Reagan had on this change.
   ``The Reagan backers will attribute it to the foreign policy and
the defense buildup,'' Taylor said. ``Others to the moderate center
and the left (wing) will question that. The far left will deny it.''

   Jim and Tammy Bakker, Midwestern
sweethearts from humble beginnings, built one of America's most
successful television ministries, raising hundreds of millions of
dollars, only to lose it in a shot.
   Now, after a nearly two-year hiatus, they are fighting to get
back on the air despite a federal indictment accusing Bakker of
pocketing millions of dollars from faithful viewers.
   ``These people have lost so much and they want to come back to
share what they have learned,'' said Jim Toms, a lawyer who has
represented Bakker since his 1987 resignation from PTL in the
Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.
   Love them or hate them, the Bakkers have one quality _ resiliency.
   On Monday, Bakker and three former aides were indicted on charges
of fraud and conspiracy. Still, the couple plan to tape several TV
specials at home and hope to be on the air within a month. Bakker is
trying to line up stations to carry the show.
   ``I think we'll see a more introspective and cautious Jim Bakker
in his message,'' Toms said.
   Toms said Bakker will plead innocent Thursday to the charges,
which carry up to 120 years in prison and $6 million in fines.
   Bakker and Richard Dortch, his top deputy at PTL, are accused of
diverting more than $4 million for personal use of the $158 million
raised in ``lifetime partnerships'' from 1984 through 1987.
   The Bakkers' new goals are modest compared to their successes.
   In 1986, Bakker's last full year at PTL, the ministry boasted
annual revenue of $129 million and employed 2,000 people. An
estimated 6 million visitors came that year to PTL's 2,300-acre
Heritage USA Christian retreat near Charlotte.
   Three months ago, Bakker couldn't raise a $3 million down payment
to regain control of PTL, whose assets are being auctioned off
Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to pay off an estimated $130 million
in debt.
   In the beginning, Bakker's ambitions were humble. The youngest of
four children, he was born Jan. 2, 1940, in Muskegon, Mich.
   Bakker was brought up in the Assembly of God church but became
active only after he ran over a young boy with his father's car when
he was 18. The youngster survived, and Bakker said he was
transformed.
   ``At that point, Jesus became the only thing in my life,'' he
wrote in his autobiography, ``Move that Mountain.''
   Bakker met Tamara Faye LaValley of International Falls, Minn., at
North Central Bible College in Minneapolis. They married in 1961 and
spent the next five years crusading.
   Pat Robertson hired them in 1965 at his Christian Broadcasting
Network. Jim and Tammy Bakker were hosts of a puppet show, and
Bakker later became cohost with Robertson of the ``700 Club.''
   In 1974, the Bakkers moved to Charlotte and began putting
together PTL, which stands for Praise The Lord or People That Love.
   In a short time, Bakker was preaching to overflow crowds. Viewers
of the weekday talk show, ``PTL Club,'' were sending in millions of
dollars. Renamed the ``Jim and Tammy Show,'' it was carried by 1976
by some 70 stations and 20 cable TV systems.
   In 1978, the ministry purchased 1,100 acres in South Carolina and
built a $1 million satellite system, a home for handicapped children
and a water park estimated at $10 million.
   In 1986, PTL launched plans for a $1.5 billion project called
Villages of the World, including condominiums, a golf course and a
hotel. In 1987, ground was broken on a 30,000-seat, $100 million
Crystal Palace.
   The Bakker's spending habits have been well documented, including
stories about luxury cars, expensive homes on both coasts and
shopping sprees.
   Speaking about Heritage USA, Bakker once asked, ``Why should I
apologize because God throws in crystal chandeliers, mahogany floors
and the finest construction in the world?''
   It all came crashing down in March 1987. The Bakkers told viewers
that Tammy was being treated for drug dependency. Two weeks later,
Bakker resigned over his 1980 sexual encounter with Ms. Hahn, a
church secretary from West Babylon, N.Y.
   Bakker said he had been blackmailed by ``treacherous former
friends'' but admitted having sex with Ms. Hahn and paying her hush
money.
   Other allegations have surfaced in recent months. Former ``PTL
Club'' cohost John Wesley Fletcher was quoted by Penthouse magazine
last week as saying that he was Bakker's ``male prostitute.''
   While Bakker has remained silent, his wife said Thursday that
Fletcher was lying. ``I've lived with that man for 27 years and I
know he's not (bisexual),'' she told talk-show host Sally Jessy
Raphael.

   For three days and nights, Agam Adamyan and scores
of other Moscow volunteers have packed and loaded tons of clothes,
bedding and baby food to ship to earthquake victims in Armenia.
   Unshaven and haggard, Adamyan appeared a man with a mission
Saturday as he scurried through winding corridors of the Armenian
government building, directing newcomers to the basement where
cardboard boxes and black plastic bags of donations reached the
ceiling.
   Plump Russian women carrying bulging suitcases mingled in the
lobby with dark-haired Armenians who raced around looking for string
and the rare roll of packing tape.
   ``We're getting lots of help from Moscow residents,'' Adamyan
said. ``People are coming of their own initative. Everybody here is
a volunteer, and Armenians and Russians are working together.''
   When a Russian receptionist said the director of the office was
very busy and asked a reporter to leave the premises, Adamyan
stepped in and said, ``Those are not objective grounds. Come take a
look at what we are doing.''
   The relief effort is unusual for the Soviet Union because it is
spontaneous and voluntary rather than ordered by officials.
   Black ribbons marking two days of official mourning in Armenia
fluttered from the ends of flagpoles holding the Armenian and Soviet
flags above the pale yellow Armenian government building, located a
10-minute walk from the Kremlin in central Moscow.
   In one room, Armenian and Russian university students chattered
and sorted through mounds of children's clothes, stuffed animals and
boxes of baby food and tossed them into the appropriate boxes.
   ``Above all, we have got to get more children's food and blankets
for the homeless,'' Adamyan said. Pillows, thick wool blankets and
heavy comforters are piled in another room.
   Outside the building, other volunteers tossed packages onto a
waiting bus from the Soviet travel organization Intourist to be
taken to the airport.
   So far, the volunteers have dispatched more than 20 tons of
donations to Yerevan and have said they will stay as long as people
continue to donate.
   At least three other collection points have been set up in the
Soviet capital by the Komsomol, the Communist Party youth
organization, and representatives of the Armenian church in Moscow
met to intensify relief efforts.
   Volunteers also are manning an around-the-clock telephone
switchboard to field inquiries to the Armenian government offices.
   A page of typewritten verses from an anonymous Moscow poet hung
on the bulletin board at the entrance to the building.
   ``I saw the mountains of Ararat (where Noah's Ark supposedly
landed) and there was trouble and the tremor of the Earth. And I am
with you brother,'' wrote the poet, who signed his lines simply as
``Muscovite.''

   Chinese troops in the Tibetan capital shot into
crowds of people demonstrating for human rights Saturday, apparently
killing two people and wounding three, including a Dutch woman,
witnesses said.
   An official at the Tibetan Foreign Affairs office in Lhasa, Zhu
Jianhua, said police fired warning shots in the air and hit some
people by accident but he did not know how many. Zhu said he could
not confirm the report of deaths.
   In a report late Saturday, China's official Xinhua News Agency
said a group of Buddhist monks and nuns ``started a riot in Lhasa''
but it said nothing about casualties.
   The Xinhua report said the nuns and monks walked from one temple
to the central market near the Jokhang Temple, one of the holiest
sites of Tibetan Buddhism, and were joined by other people.
   ``On the way, some other people joined in. Some of them were seen
waving flags in support of the independence of Tibet,'' the report
said.
   ``As the crowd grew unruly, policeman on duty began to take
measures to stop the marchers, who were later dispersed,'' the
report said.
   It was the third time since last year that blood has been shed in
Lhasa during demonstrations by Tibetans against Chinese rule.
   Protests in October 1987 and March left at least 38 people dead,
dozens injured and hundreds arrested.
   The demonstration came as the Chinese government and Tibet's
exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, were exchanging proposals about a
possible meeting in Geneva to discuss ways of bringing peace to the
remote Himalayan region.
   The demonstrators, who were commemorating the 40th anniversary of
the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights, gathered before noon in front
of the Jokhang Temple, said two Western tourists at a Lhasa hotel
and a Tibetan worker.
   The witnesses, reached by telephone from Beijing, said protesters
holding the banned Tibetan flag entered the marketplace near the
temple and crowds of Tibetans surged toward them. Chinese troops
opened fire on the crowd and Tibetans threw rocks at the Chinese.
Tear gas filled the air, sending protesters fleeing, the witnesses
said.
   About an hour later, the protesters returned but were dispersed
again after Chinese troops fired guns in the air, they said.
   ``About 30 Tibetans walked into the marketplace near the temple
at around 11:30 a.m.,'' said Lucia Dezries, of Urk, the Netherlands,
who said she witnessed the events. ``They were walking in twos. The
first man was holding a Tibetan flag. A crowd in the marketplace
began to encourage them. Then the soldiers began shooting.''
   The crowd began pelting the soldiers with rocks, but it was not
clear which came first, the rock-throwing or the shooting, she said.
   Ms. Dezries said a 25-year-old woman, also from the Netherlands,
was shot in the arm by Chinese forces and hospitalized but was not
seriously hurt.''
   She said she saw two Tibetans lying in pools of blood. ``Later
two Westerners told me that they had died,'' she said.
   ``I saw women carrying their bodies,'' said the Tibetan worker at
another hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I have been
told they are dead.''
   An American tourist, contacted at another hotel, said she
witnessed the demonstration and believed that two people had been
killed. She declined to give her name.
   The deaths could not be independently confirmed.
   Ms. Dezries said she also saw two Tibetan women being helped from
the marketplace with what appeared to be bullet wounds in their
legs. ``They were both bleeding and they couldn't walk,'' she said.
   Ms. Dezries said she did not see police arrest any Tibetans.
   After the demonstration, Ms. Dezries said, pilgrims continued to
pray around the Jokhang Temple. Two pools of blood lay on each side
of the temple, and Tibetans placed stones on the blood along with
candles and sticks of incense.
   Ms. Dezries quoted monks as saying there would be more
demonstrations Sunday, but she said police told tourists the Jokhang
Temple would be closed for three days.
   She said it was not clear whether the Tibetans participating in
the demonstration were Buddhist monks because they all were in
street clothes.
   Monks have traditionally been at the head of Tibet's independence
movement, and have led a series of anti-Chinese protests beginning
in September 1987.
   At least 14 people were killed Oct. 1, 1987, when a protest
turned into an attack on a local police station. In March,
pro-independence Tibetans clashed again with police, and Western
travelers quoted Tibetans as saying at least 24 people died. Chinese
reports said hundreds were arrested.
   Chinese officials have said most of those arrested in the October
and March protests have since been released.
   Communist Chinese troops entered Tibet in 1950. Tibetans rose up
in a mass rebellion in 1959 but Chinese troops crushed them, and the
current Dalai Lama fled to exile in India.
   The Dalai Lama said in July that he was willing to accept Chinese
control over Tibet's foreign affairs and a Chinese military presence
there if China would give the region autonomy in domestic matters.
China rejected the proposal, but in September said it was willing to
meet with him.

<TEXT>
   A former co-worker of TV talk show host Morton
Downey Jr. has filed a defamation lawsuit over comments Downey made
during an interview with a Milwaukee radio station.
   Catherine Catalane filed the lawsuit Friday in Milwaukee County
Circuit Court, naming Downey, radio station WLZR and staffer
Marilynn Mee as defendants.
   Catalane's lawsuit arises from a phone interview with Downey that
WLZR broadcast on Dec. 1 and again on Dec. 3. In the interview, Mee
jokingly suggested that Downey and Catalane had once had a sexual
relationship. Downey responded with a sexual remark about Catalane.
   The lawsuit, filed by lawyer Robert E. Sutton, contends the
statements were ``false, defamatory and slanderous.'' The lawsuit
also contends the radio station's broadcast invaded Catalane's
privacy in violation of Wisconsin law.
   Specific monetary damages were not listed.
   WLZR has been broadcasting an apology to Catalane and her family
for several days. On the tape, David Crowl, WLZR's vice president
and general manager, says, in part:
   ``The comments made by Mr. Downey during the interview were
solely his own. They did not reflect the opinions of WLZR staff and
management.'' Crowl also apologizes for ``mistakenly''
rebroadcasting the interview two days later.
   A written copy of the apology was mailed to Catalane's attorney
Wednesday, according to the station.
   Crowl and Mee had no comment on the lawsuit.
   ``I have no comment. I have not seen the suit,'' Crowl said.
   Downey's New York-based spokesman, John Murphy, said, ``We don't
have any comment at this moment.''
   Catalane is a former traffic reporter for Milwaukee's WTMJ-AM. In
1986 and 1987, she was a news anchor on Chicago's WMAQ-AM while
Downey was host of a talk show on that station.
   Catalane says in her lawsuit that Downey has been hostile to her
since an incident in October 1986 at WMAQ. She now lives in
Evanston, Ill.
   The lawsuit says that on Oct. 30, 1986, Downey slapped Catalane
in the face ``apparently because (she) would not conform to Downey's
directions.'' The lawsuit alleges Downey also indecently exposed
himself to Catalane during the incident.
   The Morton Downey Jr. Show is a syndicated television talk
program.

intruder eight months ago, returned to performing with a benefit
concert for crime victims.
   Carlton has undergone extensive physical training and voice
therapy since the April 6 random attack at his Hollywood Hills

   ``I'm fine. I was left with this voice, and from this day
forward, this is the voice I will bring to you to say `I love you,'
'' Carlton said in a raspy voice after receiving a standing ovation
Friday night at the Universal Amphitheater.
   Carlton, 40, then performed a blues jam to show he was back in
the form that put him on more than 3,000 career recordings with such

   Eight years after the murder of John
Lennon, the younger brother of Paul McCartney is hoping his exhibit
of silkscreens and early Beatles' photographs will help uphold the
fallen Beatle's good name.
   Michael McCartney, 44, a photographer and writer of children's
books who lives in his native Liverpool, opened the exhibit
Thursday, the eighth anniversary of Lennon's death in New York City.
   ``There are few people in this world who I've been proud to meet,
and Lennon is one of them ... a lovely, charming man,'' McCartney
said. ``All you go on is what people are. You should never listen to
stories secondhand.''
   The exhibit includes photographs taken by a camera Paul McCartney
bought for his brother while performing in Hamburg, West Germany,
long before the Beatles became superstars.
   One image of Lennon at 19, laughing at his detractors after an
early Beatles' show in Liverpool, makes a good response to ``The
Lives of John Lennon,'' an unflattering biography by Albert Goldman
published this fall, McCartney said.
   ``It's disgusting that John can't do anything about this book,''
McCartney said. ``The dead can't defend themselves.''

   Author Clive Cussler, whose National
Underwater and Marine Agency looks for sunken ships, now is looking
for a lost train.
   Cussler, a Golden resident and author of such novels as ``Raise
the Titanic,'' is seeking volunteers to search for a Kansas-Pacific
locomotive believed buried in the dry bed of Kiowa Creek, about 30
miles east of Denver, during an 1878 flood.
   It was hauling 25 cars and a caboose when it ran off a washed-out
bridge, the marine agency said. The train's engineer, fireman and
brakeman were killed. The locomotive was never found.
   It is thought the engine may have sunk as much as 50 feet to
bedrock through quicksand stirred up by floodwaters.
   ``This locomotive was the only local history mystery we could
find,'' said Craig Dirgo, director of special projects for the
Colorado-based agency, which has specialized in looking for sunken
vessels, including the Merrimac, Titanic and the U-20 submarine,
which sank the Lusitania.
   Dirgo said Cussler will lead a group of volunteers the weekend of
Jan 7-8 to look for the engine.
   ``You just can't lose an all-metal locomotive,'' Dirgo said. He
estimated it weighed 200,000 pounds.
   Dirgo said the most recent organized search for the train was in
May 1953 by a Colorado School of Mines professor. ``They only
searched an area of 150 by 400 feet and didn't have the kind of
equipment we have now,'' Dirgo said.

   President-elect Bush called Saturday for a free
flow of aid to earthquake victims in Armenia and the Soviet
ambassador said his countrymen have been ``deeply moved'' by the
outpouring of sympathy.
   ``If something has to be changed to expedite help to the people,
it should be done,'' Bush said as he paid a condolence call at the
Soviet Embassy. ``I know of no barriers.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, dressed in black, were among a stream
of visitors Saturday to sign a book at the embassy and look at news
photographs of the earthquake damage in Armenia, where Soviet
officials estimate as many as 45,000 people were killed.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz came a few minutes later and
had a private discussion with Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who
delivered a letter from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Dubinin would not disclose the contents of the letter, and Shultz
left the embassy without saying what was in it.
   The State Department has set up an around-the-clock task force to
monitor the situation in Armenia and relay information. Two teams of
disaster relief specialists left the United States on Saturday
aboard planes that also carried supplies.
   ``This is an immense tragedy, and we are responding to is in
every way we can,'' Shultz said.
   The embassy, which has opened its iron gates to anyone wanting to
sign the book of condolences, has had to install extra telephone
lines to handle all of the calls that have been coming in since the
earthquake on Wednesday, said Soviet spokesman Boris Malakhov.
   Dubinin said, ``We are deeply moved by the response. We are open
to all assistance necessary to help people.'' At the top of the list
of items needed were medical equipment and supplies, he said.
   Robert Gale, the Los Angeles physician who helped treat victims
of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, was among
those heading for Armenia.
   Dubinin told reporters that Gale's presence did not mean that the
earthquake had damaged nuclear facilities in the area.
   ``There is absolutely no information about any radiation
difficulties,'' he said. A nuclear power station in Armenia was
unaffected by the earthquake, he said.
   Dubinin said the response to the tragedy was part of a ``new
political spirit in the world,'' adding that people should be united
``not only in disasters.''
   The Bushes, accompanied by incoming national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft, entered the embassy through a mirrored hallway and
were escorted up a red-carpeted staircase beneath a large portrait
of Lenin, where they were greeted by Dubinin.
   Mrs. Bush kissed Liana Dubinin, the ambassador's wife, before
they entered the room where the book was kept on a red-draped table
trimmed in black. A Soviet flag topped with two black ribbons stood
in the room, where the chandeliers, paintings and mirrors all were
covered in black.
   ``With anguish in our hearts for all those in the Soviet Union
who lost loved ones,'' Bush wrote in the book.
   Representatives of other governments, including China, Britain,
Pakistan and the Vatican, came to the embassy to sign the book
around the time of the visits by Bush and Shultz.

   The United Nations peacekeeping forces, who
received the Nobel Peace Prize on Saturday, could hand the nations
of the world a bill for services rendered totaling nearly $1 billion
in unpaid U.N. dues.
   U.N. figures show the 159 member nations owe the world body
$979.1 million dollars in unpaid regular dues and peacekeeping
assessments, with the United States being the chief deadbeat.
   On Friday, when U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
accepted the Nobel Prize award money in Oslo, Norway, on behalf of
the more than half-million peacekeepers who have served the United
Nations, he observed:
   ``In some ways it's embarrassing because it forces me to say
publicly that the United States still owes the United Nations almost
$350 million.''
   U.N. member nations owe the world body $450.1 million in regular
dues; $360.1 million in dues for the Lebanon, Middle East and
Iran-Iraq peacekeeping forces; and $168.9 million in unpaid
contributions to the Cyprus peacekeeping force.
   The Cyprus force is supposed to be financed through voluntary
contributions the United Nations uses to reimburse the participating
nations _ Australia, Austria, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Ireland and Sweden.
   President Reagan said in September that the United States would
gradually repay all its dues. It has withheld money in recent years
to protest what the Reagan administration saw as mismanagement,
overstaffing, and an anti-Western bias at the United Nations.
   The Soviet Union owes $7.2 million in regular dues and $151.3
million in peacekeeping dues, which it is repaying on a schedule
worked out with the United Nations.

   Soviet scientists are trying to determine why the
Armenian earthquake toppled whole cities and killed more than 40,000
people. One U.S. expert blamed much of the devastation on poorly
constructed buildings.
   Soviet seismologist Igor Nersesov told a news conference Saturday
a commission was sent to the Armenian city of Leninakan to determine
why three-quarters of the buildings in the city of 250,000 tumbled
when construction supposedly was sufficient to withstand some
shaking.
   Wednesday's quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and its
epicenter was not far from the surface. A similar earthquake in
southern California would have killed about 1,000 people, acting
state geologist Brian Tucker told The Associated Press in California
on Friday.
   Tucker, who spent two years in Armenia on a research project,
blamed the high death toll in Armenia on local construction, which
tends to be loosely connected, unreinforced concrete slabs in the
city or adobe in the villages.
   Nersesov told reporters in Moscow that ``with a duly organized
scientific system of observation and research, we could have'''
predicted the quake.
   He said a team of seismic experts also had been sent to Armenia
in an attempt to predict aftershocks.
   The latest seismic records for northwestern Armenia were
destroyed in the quake along with the Institute of Seismology in
Leninakan, Nersesov said. The institute had been researching
earthquake-proof construction techniques.
   Like Western scientists, the Leninakan researchers were hampered
by the difficulty of testing their theories. The University of
California at Irvine recently built a complex engineering laboratory
with the ability to simulate earthquakes.
   Nersesov said construction in the Leninakan area should have been
sufficient to withstand the force of an earthquake rated 8 on the
12-point Soviet scale of potential earthquake damage. That level is
described in reference books as ``destructive,'' causing ``cracks on
sharp slopes and wet slopes. Monuments are moved or turned over.
Houses are considerably damaged. ''
   Officials say Wednesday's quake was closer to a 10 on the
12-point scale.
   In answer to a question, Nersesov also said buildings are not
always constructed according to regulation.

<HEAD>Top Democrat Praises Reagan, Shultz for Soviet Relations</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Gorbachev Bjt</HEAD>

   A top Democrat praised President Reagan on
Saturday for an ``extraordinary role'' in changing U.S. relations
with the Soviet Union and called George P. Shultz ``one of the great
secretaries of state of our time.''
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington endorsed both
Reagan's expression of hope that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms will become permanent and the president's
cautions about continued Soviet military strength in Europe.
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address, repeated yet again his
upbeat assessment of last week's meeting in New York _ his last as
president _ with the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly on
Wednesday, pledged to unilaterally slash Soviet troop strength by
500,000 men and 10,000 tanks within two years.
   ``If (Gorbachev's) vision is realized and these promises are
turned into deeds, we would be witnessing a dramatic change in the
Soviet system,'' Reagan said.
   The president said, however, that his administration's military
buildup, adherence to democratic values, and criticism of Soviet
human rights violations helped bring change.
   He said that even if promised Soviet troop and equipment
reductions occur, the Warsaw Pact will retain ``a large advantage''
over the NATO alliance.
   Foley, in the Democratic response to Reagan's address, said it
was ``fair and accurate'' for Reagan to note that Soviet forces
remain superior over NATO.
   ``While we must thus be cautious about the extent of our
optimism,'' he said, ``Americans will agree with President Reagan's
comment, that if the Gorbachev program is carried out in full, we
would be witnessing a dramatic restructuring of Soviet society,
which history would regard as tremendously important. ''
   Foley said Gorbachev ``appeared to be offering cooperation rather
than confrontation.''
   ``President Reagan has played an extraordinary role in bringing
about these important changes in our relationship,'' the Democratic
leader said, adding that most of the president's actions in foreign
affairs have strong bipartisan support in Congress. Exceptions, he
noted, have been Reagan's policies toward Nicaragua and South Africa.
   ``In addition to the president on the administration side, great
credit must go to Secretary of State George Shultz, whose forthright
dealings with the Congress and skillful diplomatic leadership will
mark him as one of the great secretaries of state of our time,''
Foley said.
   He said Democrats ``trust and believe that the incoming
administration of President-elect Bush will recognize what
bipartisanship has accomplished, and that together we can usher in a
new era of cooperation, as we face our national challenges at home
and abroad.''
   Meanwhile, U.N. Ambassador Vernon Walters sounded a cautionary
note. ``It's a long way before the Soviet Union becomes a democratic
country like the countries of Western Europe,'' he said in an
interview broadcast Saturday on CNN's ``Evans & Novak'' show.

<HEAD>Worried Lawrence Livermore Lab Asks For Hacker Contact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker who has breached
low-level security at a top federal weapons laboratory about 10
times in the past week is being urged by officials to contact the
lab ``to find out what he wants.''
   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has spent nearly
$100,000 in lost resources and attempts to stop the invader, who
gains access through a national computer communications network, lab
officials estimated.
   No files or data in the computers appear to have been altered.
   ``I've offered an invitation for him to call me through the
media,'' said Charles Cole, the lab's computer security manager.
``I'd like to talk to him. My number's listed, or if he called the
laboratory he could get me very easily.''
   Lab officials also are considering trying to contact the hacker
the next time he logs onto their computers by leaving a message for
him.
   ``In one sense it would be nice if (the hacker) went away, but
I'd rather he stayed with us for a while so we can find out what he
wants,'' Cole said.
   ``What worries me is where is he (in the system) that we don't
know about,'' he added.
   The lab, run by the University of California Berkeley, is one of
the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing of
nuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.
   No classified computer systems have been affected, Cole said.
   The hacker appeared in the lab's computers last weekend and has
been on and off the system ever since. The most recent appearance
was Thursday night, Cole said.
   ``As best we can determine, he hasn't altered anything with the
exception of creating a password for himself so he can get back
on,'' he said, adding:
   ``But he hasn't done anything really destructive on the system,
and before he would be inclined to do that I hope he would talk to
me about what his problem is.''
   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a
computer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by another
hacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were through
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access
points that have not been patched.
   Cole said the intrusions do not involve a virus, a program that
can order a computer to replicate itself or send it on to another
computer. ``This attack is being done by someone or a group who are
maneuvering into the system manually,'' he said.
   The hacker has already broken federal laws which prohibit
unauthorized use of federal computer systems, Cole said, and he may
have violated state laws as well.
   Cole speculated that the hacker is simply ``joy riding.''
   It was determined that Stanford University and the University of
Washington were gateways from which the hacker entered the Livermore
system by means of the Internet communications system, but it is not
known if the hacking originated there.
   Part of the problem in tracing a hacker on Internet is that it is
so large. Internet is used by research facilities and military
contractors nationwide and there is no single path through which
messages must travel.
   The lab has closed the holes which they believe the hacker used.
But a couple of computers have been left unprotected in an attempt
to make contact or trace the person.
   ``We could close up our system, in which case he would move on,''
Cole said.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, given by Rep. Tom Foley:
   Good afternoon. This is Representative Tom Foley of the state of
Washington, majority leader of the United States House of
Representatives.
   We Americans have traditionally appreciated the bold stroke. At
the United Nations this past Wednesday, Soviet General Secretary
Mikhail Gorbachev gave us a splendid example of a bold stroke. He
offered a far-reaching proposal to unilaterally cut Soviet forces by
half a million troops over the next two years.
   This reduction would include the withdrawal of some 50,000 troops
and 5,000 tanks from three East European countries, and the
restructuring of the remaining Soviet forces in a more defensive
posture.
   On a broader scale, the secretary general appeared to promise an
end to persecution for political or religious beliefs, and offered
the incoming administration of President-elect Bush a ready
negotiating partner to continue work on cuts in overall strategic
arms and conventional forces in Europe.
   In speaking on the politics of change, he clearly appeared to be
offering cooperation rather than confrontation.
   As President Reagan said today, it is certainly true that the
Soviet Union has far to go in its full economic restructuring, and
in its recognition of human rights. It is also fair and accurate to
note, as the president did, that Soviet forces would still retain
superiority over NATO in important categories, even if the announced
reductions are fully implemented.
   While we must thus be cautious about the extent of our optimism,
Americans will agree with President Reagan's comment, that if the
Gorbachev program is carried out in full, we would be witnessing a
dramatic restructuring of Soviet society, which history would regard
as tremendously important.
   The secretary general's early departure from the United States
was required by a disastrous earthquake in Armenia, which has left
tens of thousands dead and injured.
   We join the president in expressing our heartfelt sympathy and
sorrow to the victims of the devastating earthquake, and we stand
with him in his continuing offer of US humanitarian assistance in
this tragedy.
   The full import of General Secretary Gorbachev's plan remains for
the weeks and months ahead, but his remarks alone tell us how far
Soviet policy and our own relationship with the Soviet Union have
come over the past few years.
   President Reagan has played an extraordinary role in bringing
about these important changes in our relationship. But as strong
Democratic Party congressional approval of the INF Treaty
demonstrated, the president's efforts have had strong bipartisan
support.
   In fact, with the exceptions of disputes about our policy toward
Nicaragua and South Africa, President Reagan's administration has
enjoyed the traditional bipartisan support in foreign policy.
   In addition to the president on the administration side, great
credit must go to Secretary of State George Shultz, whose forthright
dealings with the Congress and skillful diplomatic leadership will
mark him as one of the great secretaries of state of our time.
   We trust and believe that the incoming administration of
President-elect Bush will recognize what bipartisanship has
accomplished, and that together we can usher in a new era of
cooperation, as we face our national challenges at home and abroad.
   The American people have recently concluded an election, which
have left the executive and legislative branches of government in
the control of different parties. Although the campaign was
occasionally acrimonious, elections are not an end to themselves,
but a means to an end.
   If there is a political mandate in the 1988 elections, it is the
public's expectation that a Republican president and a Democratic
Congress will now, together, address our pressing national issues.
That is the public's rightful expectation, and our shared
responsibility.
   Since World War II, this shared responsibility has been the rule
rather than the exception, and experience has shown us it can work,
from the Marshall Plan's economic reconstruction of Western Europe
in the 80th Congress to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement in the
100th Congress.
   As President-elect Bush prepares to take office, the
administration and the Congress face daunting challenges in such
areas as medical care, education, the environment, economic
competitiveness, agriculture, national security, and foreign affairs.
   It is important to recognize that if we are to continue making
progress in the vital area of U.S.-Soviet relations, which has so
highlighted these last years of President Reagan's presidency, we
must have a strong economy and a strong society at home.
   The first task of the new administration and the 100th Congress
must be to face the unprecedented budget and trade deficits.
   These issues are too important, now and for the future
generations, for one branch of government, or one political party,
to act alone. Solutions will require the active consent and
cooperation of the president and the Congress. Democrats in the
Congress stand ready to work with President-elect Bush in this
spirit of conciliation and cooperation.
   This is Representative Tom Foley. Thank you for listening.

   When Marlan Perhus asked, ``Will you
marry me?'' Lisa Verwest was almost too frightened to answer.
   Perhus, an aviation student at the University of North Dakota,
popped the question at an altitude of 2,500 feet _ as the engine of
his Cessna 172 sputtered and coughed.
   It was an ``emergency'' Perhus said he cooked up as part of an
elaborate plan to propose to Miss Verwest, a North Dakota State
University student.
   Perhus had hidden a red-wrapped box containing a diamond ring in
the pouch behind his pilot's seat when he and Miss Verwest went for
a Sunday morning flight last month to celebrate their first
anniversary of going out.
   His flight plan was to put the plane's engine on low idle and ask
Miss Verwest to reach into the pouch for an emergency checklist, in
hopes she would find the ring instead, Perhus said.
   ``I had just reduced the power, like when you take your foot off
the accelerator in a car,'' Perhus said, which made the plane's
engine ``pop and sputter a little bit.''
   But Miss Verwest, in her nervous search for the emergency list,
missed the ring box. Perhus had to help.
   ``When she saw it, that's when I said, `Will you marry me?'''
Perhus recalled. ``After the fear subsided, she said a great big
`Yes,' with a hug, and a kiss or two.''
   ``I was basically stunned,'' Miss Verwest said.
   The couple plan to finish college before they set a wedding date.
   Perhus said after he earns his degree in aviation, he hopes to
work with the Federal Aviation Administration _ as an accident
prevention specialist.

   Cleanliness may be a virtue, but it's not fiscally
responsible according to a consulting firm that decided a state-run
nursing home has too many employees.
   ``I don't think I've ever seen a public building that's
cleaner,'' said Bill Evans, vice president of Cresap Management
Consultants in Washington, D.C., the company paid $200,000 to study
Colorado's social services operation.
   ``It's just spic and span. They wash the windows inside and out
once a week. We saw them mopping spotless floors _ floors that were
spotless before they were mopped.''
   While the 240-bed Trinidad State Nursing Home in southern
Colorado got high marks for cleanliness and staff care, it got a low
mark for fiscal efficiency in the presentation Evans made Wednesday
to the legislature's budget-writing committee.
   Social Services Director Irene Ibarra said Friday the cleanliness
issue was not the type of criticism she expected.
   ``That's the part I can't get over,'' she said. ``The residents
are happy with what is being done. I think that's what we should be
doing in this state. They really do a very good job down there.''

   A physician faked a burglary at his office
and stabbed himself with a rod to simulate bullet wounds as part of
an elaborate plan to get away from his practice and get disability
income, police say.
   Dr. Robert McCormick, a pediatrician from Redlands, Calif., had
been missing for nearly a month when he was found early Tuesday
lying on a sidewalk in this suburb of Phoenix. Police said it
appeared he had been beaten and shot.
   McCormick, 49, first claimed he could remember nothing between
Nov. 13, when he was discovered missing, and when he awoke Tuesday
at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix, where he had
emergency surgery, said Glendale police spokesman Marshal Downen.
   But on Friday, however, McCormick ``admitted to investigators
that he fabricated the entire incident in which he was believed to
be the victim of an attempted homicide,'' Downen said. ``Dr.
McCormick stated last night from his hospital bed that he had
planned the deception for months.''
   He had been reported missing by Redlands police, who said they
tried unsuccessfully to contact him about a burglary at his office.
   ``He staged the burglary from his office in Redlands, then came
to Arizona on his motorcycle,'' Downen said. ``He traveled around
the state, staying in motels and hotels under assumed names while
looking for a site to be discovered as a victim of an abduction and
attempted homicide.''
   He said McCormick told police that he had been going through a
divorce for two years.
   ``Dr. McCormick stated that he planned the deception because he
was tired of his practice in Redlands and wanted to leave it yet
retain an income, which he planned to receive through disability
insurance as a result of his traumatic ordeal,'' Downen said.
   Downen said McCormick told investigators that he used a
``grinding tool'' to bruise his skin, then anesthetized his head and
abdomen and ``jammed a rod into these areas to simulate being shot.''
   He said McCormick had fired a .32-caliber handgun at a piece of
meat, then retrieved the slug and inserted it into the wound he had
made in his abdomen.
   McCormick then walked to the Glendale site where he was found,
injected himself with Demerol ``to create a stuporous appearance,''
bound himself at the ankles, wrist and neck, rolled himself up in
black landscaping plastic and waited to be discovered, Downen said.
   McCormick's wife, Nedra, told the Redlands Daily Facts on Friday
that the family was shocked.
   ``I still can't believe that he would have abused himself this
way,'' she told the newspaper.
   Redlands police Sgt. Walter Kadyk said the case was being
referred to the San Bernardino County district attorney to determine
if there was any criminal intent and if any charges will filed
against McCormick.
   The city attorney in Redlands, about 70 miles east of Los
Angeles, also will consider seeking from McCormick some of the cost
of investigating his disappearance.
   ``We spent $25,000 in just investigators' time and expenses,''
Kadyk said. ``We had two people assigned full time, to the detriment
of other pending cases.''
   Downen said Glendale police will seek misdemeanor charges of
false reporting against McCormick.
   McCormick remained hospitalized but had been removed from the
intensive care unit, Downen said.

   Israeli troops Saturday shot and killed a
Palestinian boy who hurled a firebomb at soldiers and a Palestinian
prisoner who attacked a guard with a homemade knife, the army said.
   Soldiers shot and wounded at least 22 Palestinians in the
occupied lands, among them a 9-year-old girl shot in the back by
troops chasing rioting youths, hospital officials said. The army
said only four Palestinians were injured.
   In Tel Aviv, several hundred Israelis gathered in Kings of Israel
square to call for an immediate end to the occupation, Israeli radio
said. The protest was sponsored by the leftist ``Enough of the
Occupation'' group.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, called for escalating
anti-Israeli violence.
   ``As we near victory, we must realize that the most ferocious and
bloody confrontations occur in the last quarter of an hour before
peace,'' Arafat said in a statement released by the Palestine
Liberation Organization office in Cyprus.
   The 16-year-old Gaza City boy, Hosni Abu Sido, was one of a group
of teen-agers who threw gasoline-filled bottles at a patrol in Gaza
City Saturday morning several hours after a curfew was lifted and
residents were allowed out of their homes, the army spokesman said.
   ``The lives of soldiers were in danger and the commander of the
patrol opened fire,'' a military spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. ``The boy who was killed was clearly the one who threw a
Molotov cocktail.''
   He said a soldier was slightly wounded in the attack.
   The prisoner, 20-year-old Abdallah Abu Mahruka, was killed when
he tried to stab a guard with a homemade knife while he and other
inmates in Gaza City's prison were taken out on a daily walk, the
army said.
   The guard who was attacked was lightly wounded, and a guard who
shot Mahruka was hospitalized after he was hit by a bullet ricochet,
an army spokesman said.
   Abu Mahkura was serving an 18-month sentence for preparing
firebombs, the army spokesman said.
   The deaths raised the number of Palestinians killed in the
year-old anti-Israeli revolt to 322. Eleven Israelis have been
killed.
   At 11 a.m., Gaza City storekeepers closed their shops and traffic
stood still for five minutes of silence in memory of the
Palestinians killed in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987.
   About 250,000 Arabs were confined to their homes in Gaza refugee
camps for the third straight day.
   All 650,000 residents of the Gaza Strip were under curfew Friday
to prevent violence marking the anniversary of the uprising.
   In East Jerusalem on Saturday, police fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse demonstrators who threw rocks in the Arab
commercial center near the walled Old City and in several Arab
neighborhoods.
   Two policemen were lightly wounded when protesters threw rocks on
a police van, smashing one of the windows, police spokesman Rafi
Levy said. At least 20 Arabs were arrested.
   Police arrested seven girls in another clash in East Jerusalem
that began when a police van was stoned and one of its windows
smashed.
   In northern Israel, arsonists caused serious damage when they set
a mosque on fire in the Israeli Arab village of Ibtin near the port
city of Haifa, Israeli radio said. An anonymous telephone caller
told police he set the fire to punish Ibtin residents, 10 of whom
were accused last week of being members of an anti-Israeli guerrilla
squad.
   The suspected guerrillas, all Arabs of Israeli citizenship, were
accused of throwing a hand grenade that blew the leg off a Haifa boy
in July.

   A stock scandal widened Saturday when the opposition
Japan Socialist Party released the names of 17 business and
government officials reportedly involved in questionable stock
purchases, news reports said.
   Two municipal Assembly members, whose Saitama and Kanagawa
regions form the hub of development in the outer Tokyo area, were
included on the list along with banking, real estate and company
officials, Kyodo News Service said.
   Okiyuki Hoashi, member of the Urawa Assembly in Saitama
prefecture, and Chikau Matsumura, former member of the Yokohama
Municipal Assembly in Kanagawa prefecture, were among 17 people
reportedly offered 170,000 shares in the real estate firm
Recruit-Cosmos Co., prior to their public listing, the report said.
   Political commentator Kiyoshi Iijima, who often appears on
television, was also named as a figure in the stock scandal, in
which a large number of influential individuals were offered
bargain-priced shares of Recruit-Cosmos, along with interest-free
financing for the purchase.
   Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister and deputy prime minister,
resigned from the Cabinet on Friday to take responsibility for
delivering conflicting testimony regarding his role in the purchase
of Recruit-Cosmos stock.
   Also on Friday, Ei Shikiba, an executive of the Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp., was removed as director of the telephone
giant's data communications department for buying unlisted
Recruit-Cosmos shares. The company's president, Haruo Yamaguchi,
said Skikiba would remain an executive director of the company with
no specific responsibilities.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest telephone
company, has been criticized for its close ties with Recruit-Cosmos,
which reportedly include the leasing of large numbers of telephone
circuits at reduced rates and the resale of two U.S.-made

   More than a dozen leading politicians, including Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have
been linked to the stock profiteering deal devised by Japanese
businessman Hiromasa Ezoe, founder of the information conglomerate
Recruit-Cosmos.
   But among the top politicians, only Miyazawa was directly
involved. He claimed he had not been informed that his former aide
purchased and then sold 10,000 of the shares in Miyazawa's name for
a profit of $185,000.
   Ezoe reportedly offered individuals from the world of government,
business, media and finance the opportunity to buy shares in
Recruit-Cosmos, a Recruit affiliate, prior to their over-the-counter
listing in October 1986.
   Shortly after the shares were offered for public trading, their
value rose sharply and earned large profits for holders. In Japan,
shares usually rise upon the start of public trading and those who
obtained Recruit-Cosmos shares would have known they stood to profit
in the deal.
   Opposition leaders spearheading a probe of the stock deal charge
that government officials were offered Recruit-Cosmos shares in
return for political favors and have blocked parliamentary debate on
a proposed package of tax reform bills to press their demands for
full-scale investigation of the affair.
   Miyazawa said he hoped his resignation would pave the way for
passage of the tax bills and, following his departure, the governing
Liberal Democratic Party set a timetable for debate on the tax
reform bills.
   If deliberations are carried out smoothly, the package will pass
before Dec. 28, when the current parliamentary session is due to
end, and as early as Dec. 23, according to press reports Saturday.

   The University of Wisconsin presented
nearly 4,000 diplomas to graduates in May, but it took six months
for anyone to notice that the name of the state was misspelled.
   ``It's amazing that something like this could happen,'' said Rosa
Johnson, supervisor of degree summary and verification at the
registrar's office on the university's Madison campus. ``It's
disbelief.''
   The error is in the lower right-hand corner of the diploma under
the signature of UW-Madison Chancellor Donna Shalala.
   It reads: ``Chancellor, University of Wisconson-Madison.''
   ``A student noticed it in mid-November,'' Johnson said, the Green
Bay Press-Gazette reported Saturday. ``We do proofread the diplomas,
but we concentrate on the name and the degree. We usually consider
that the standard information is correct. It just didn't occur to us
that this could happen.''
   Josten Diploma Service in Red Wing, Minn., where the diplomas
were produced, will pay for new replacement diplomas, Johnson said.
   A spokesman at Josten's said the person who had information about
how the error was made would not be available for comment until
Monday.
   Johnson said she had been told an incorrect plate was made but
does not know how many were printed incorrectly.
   ``We awarded 3,133 undergraduate degrees and 764 master's
diplomas in May,'' Johnson said. ``But we don't know how many were
incorrect because they used several plates. So we ordered a complete
new set and will have them if anyone discovers the mistake and wants
it corrected.
   ``But this is not being done at the expense of the state of
Wisconsin. It will cost the company a pretty penny.''

   A top West German military official
said Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S. Air Force jet that
killed six people will further erode popular support for national
defense programs.
   In the city of Remscheid, fire brigade leader Berthold Hoehler
said the body of a construction worker was pulled from the rubble of
a house destroyed in the accident, raisng the death toll from the
accident to six. Seven people hurt in Thursday's accident remained
in critical condition, he said.
   Later Saturday, at least 4,000 people took part in a torchlight
vigil and procession in downtown Remscheid to remember the victims
and to demand an end to low-level flight training missions.
   A U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet tore a swath of
destruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central West
German city of Remscheid. Rescue workers continued to comb the
debris Saturday, as work crews tore down the remains of demolished
houses.
   In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, the inspector
general of West Germany's military said the crash was certain to
have a serious impact on already sinking public support for defense
issues.
   ``We are in a very difficult psychological situation,'' Dieter
Wellershoff was quoted as saying.
   Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling
public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction
over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers.
   ``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hard
facts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,''
which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, he
said.
   West Germany, a staunch NATO ally, borders East Germany and
Czechoslovakia, thus putting it on the front lines of the East-West
struggle.
   Wellershoff's comments were to appear in the newspaper's Sunday
editions. The text of the interview was telexed in advance to other
news media.
   West Germany's skies are crowded with hundreds of jets and
helicopters each day. A series of deadly accidents has fueled
growing calls for a halt to or drastic reductions in low-level
training flights.
   Even before Thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of
military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. They
included 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at the
U.S. base in Ramstein in August.
   Following the Remscheid crash, temporary suspensions of low-level
training missions were ordered.
   The U.S. Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot of
the A-10 ``inadvertently flew into clouds'' while attempting to join
in close formation with another aircraft.
   The Air Force statement, quoting Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson,
said the pilot ``then initiated a separation maneuver as is normal
if two aircraft in formation lose visual contact.''
   The statement said the lead aircraft climbed above the clouds,
but that the second A-10 ``continued in a descent.''
   ``We do not know why,'' Anderson said in the statement.
   West German military officials have speculated that the pilot may
have become disoriented when he tried to climb out of the bad
weather.
   Witnesses on the ground, however, have said they saw one of the
jet's two engines on fire before it crashed.

   Iran's chief justice, who has declared
that captured rebels should be executed, said Saturday that Tehran
will pardon some political prisoners.
   The move apparently was aimed at countering allegations that
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist regime has executed
thousands of prisoners since August.
   Ayatollah Abdulkarim Musavi Ardebili, the chief justice, said the
prisoners would be freed in February, when the Islamic republic
celebrates the 10th anniversary of its Islamic revolution, according
to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``A number of prisoners will be freed after it is certain that
they will not break the law afterward,'' IRNA quoted Musavi as
telling a Tehran news conference.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, reported that Ardebili did not say
how many prisoners would be released, but noted that all had been
arrested ``in connection with terrorist activities.''
   He said Iranian authorities in the past have freed ``large
numbers of convicted terrorists and their sympathizers who have been
reformed in prison.''
   Ardebili denied allegations of widespread human rights
violations, including mass executions, made by Iranian opposition
groups, the United Nations and the London-based Amnesty
International human rights group.
   ``In response to the negative publicity by world oppressors about
human rights violations in Iran, we announce that we are willing to
provide any international body with the necessary documents,
statistics and evidence in order to show that this publicity if
without basis,'' he said.
   The Iraqi-based rebel group Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy
Warriors, has said 12,000 political prisoners, including large
numbers of their activists and sympathizers, have been executed in
Iranian prisons in recent months.
   IRNA has said that scores of ``counter-revolutionaries, drug
traffickers and Iraqi agents'' have been publicly executed in
several cities.
   Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, last week acknowledged some
executions, but said they involved people who were convicted by
Islamic tribunals for various crimes.
   But the U.N. General Assembly's Third Committee, which deals with
human rights, adoped a resolution Dec. 1 accusing Iran of human
rights abuses.
   It voiced concern at ``a renewed wave of executions ... resulting
in the death of a large number of persons because of their political
convictions.''
   Iranian dissidents said the latest wave of executions began after
Iran unconditionally accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the
8-year-old war with Iraq after a string of battlefield defeats.
   Before the truce took effect Aug. 20, the Mujahedeen's military
arm, the National Liberation Army of Iran, captured two western
Iranian towns in an offensive.
   The NLA claimed its forces killed or wounded 40,000 Iranians
before withdrawing across the border into Iraq. Tehran claims the
assault was bloodily repulsed.
   The Mujahedeen said the offensive alarmed the Iranians, who
launched a bloody purge of NLA supporters and other dissident
factions.
   Ardebili, along with other leading Iranian figures, publicly
called for the execution of ``counter-revolutionaries'' without
trial.
   ``There is no need for any trial,'' he said in an Aug. 5 Tehran
Radio broadcast. ``The crime is clear ... and the punishment is also
clear. I pray to God that all of them are destroyed.''
   Dissident sources have said that many of the victims of recent
executions, including Moslem clergymen, were linked to Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor.
   They said this pointed to an intensification of the power
struggle within the Tehran hierarchy as rival factions struggle for
supremacy after the death of Khomeini, 88 and reportedly in poor
health.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow In The Lower Great Lakes Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 14 inches of snow fell around parts of the eastern Great
Lakes on Saturday, and parts of New Mexico were hit by several
inches of snow.
   Squalls brought heavy snow to parts of northern and western New
York state during the night with 14 inches at Sinclairville, 12
inches at Springville and up to 8 inches south of Watertown.
   The northeastern corner of Ohio had gotten up to a foot of snow
since Friday.
   More snow was possible across the region.
   Snow fell heavily in the mountains of south-central New Mexico.
Los Lunas and Belen each received 5 inches of snow during the
morning and a winter weather advisory was posted into Sunday morning
for parts of north-central Texas.
   Snow also fell across much of Michigan, ranging from about 1 inch
at Detroit to 6 inches at Houghton on the Upper Peninsula.
   ``The best way to call it is snow-covered and slippery,'' said
Deputy Mark Bronson of the Kalamazoo County (Mich.) Sheriff's
Department. ``We have an inordinate amount of fender-benders, but I
don't think there was anything serious.''
   Light snow fell over parts of extreme northern Wisconsin.
   Showers spread rain across much of the south-central part of the
nation during the afternoon.
   Elsewhere, the Pacific Northwest had clouds and drizzle, while
fog was prevalent in the valleys of California.
   Blustery north wind pushed cold arctic air into the central and
eastern areas of the nation. Afternoon temperatures were generally
below freezing from eastern Montana through the upper half of the
Mississippi Valley to New England, with readings still below zero in
eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at International Falls, Minn., to 81 at
Homestead, Fla. Saturday morning's low was 21 degrees below zero at
Warroad, Minn.
   For Sunday, light snow or snow showers were forecast across the
northern and central Plains, with show showers also expected in the
Great Lakes region. Showers were forecast from the southern high
Plains through Louisiana and southern Arkansas to the southern
Atlantic Coast.
   Highs remaining below freezing were predicted from the northern
and central Plains to the northern half of the Atlantic Coast, with
highs in the teens or single digits from eastern North Dakota and
eastern South Dakota to New England; above 50 in the lower Rio
Grande Valley of Texas and from the central Gulf Coast across
southern Georgia and northern Florida, with highs in the 60s and 70s
across the Florida Peninsula; in the 50s and 60s along most of the
Pacific Coast to southern Arizona; in the 70s in extreme southern
California; and in the 30s and 40s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Reagan Says US Policies Helped Bring Soviet Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Saturday praised social
reforms and military forces cutbacks proposed by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev but said that the Soviets are keeping a big advantage in
ground troops and conventional weapons.
   ``I was encouraged by the new promises of reform that Mr.
Gorbachev made before the United Nations, and hope to see these and
past promises translated into permanent institutional changes that
will signal to the peoples of the Soviet Union and the world a
courageous commitment to a new path of democratization,'' Reagan
said in his weekend radio address.
   Reagan lauded Gorbachev for his proposed reforms and attempts to
open Soviet society, saying, ``If this vision is realized and these
promises are turned into deeds, we would be witnessing a dramatic
change in the Soviet system.''
   The Soviet president, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly,
pledged to slash Soviet troop strength by 500,000 men, and 10,000
tanks within two years. He offered to withdraw six tank divisions
from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary by 1991, and to reduce
Soviet forces in those countries by 50,000 men and 5,000 tanks.
   ``These unilateral reductions ... would give a long-awaited
encouragement to our efforts to achieve the genuine balance in
conventional forces that would assure greater security and greater
stability in Western Europe,'' Reagan said.
   In his five-minute talk, delivered from the Camp David retreat in
the Catoctin Mountains outside Washington, Reagan maintained the
upbeat tone he's set since concluding his final meeting with
Gorbachev on Wednesday in New York.
   ``We welcome the Soviet force reductions that are promised, but
let's remember this: even after these redeployments are completed in
1991, the Warsaw Pact will still have a large conventional advantage
an edge of about five-to-two in tanks and artillery and some 300,000
more troops,'' he said.
   The president took some credit for helping bring these changes
about, saying: ``Our steadfastness, our policies, our whole approach
has borne fruit.
   ``We have not come this way through lack of strength or any
weakness in our resolve, nor has there been anything inevitable out
what we've achieved.
   ``The unity, confidence, power and firmness of the democracies
has brought us forward and maintaining this firm alliance will keep
us moving forward.''

   Rallies to mark the first anniversary of the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories collapsed
in brawling and confusion Saturday.
   The head of Jordan's professional associations accused government
agencies of provoking the disruptions.
   A planned noon march at the University of Jordan by pro-PLO
supporters ended in stone-throwing, club-swinging battles with
Jordanian nationalists who ripped up pictures of Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Reporters saw at least one person injured, but there was no
official report on the number of casualties.
   In the evening, the Professional Associations' Union canceled a
series of events scheduled to commemorate the anniversary of the
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after a Jordanian-based
Palestinian dissident group disrupted a scheduled lecture.
   ``These people are sent by the government because they want to
stop our activities,'' said Laith Shubeilat, head of the council of
11 associations that represent most of the country's doctors,
nurses, engineers, lawyers, journalists and other professionals.
   ``These hired hands and hired voices under the protection of the
government interfered, uninvited, on the premises,'' Shubeilat told
The Associated Press.
   An estimated 1.5 million Palestinians live in Jordan, most of
them in the capital, Amman.
   Most fled from Palestine after Israel was created as a state in
1948 and when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip during
the 1967 Middle East War.
   At the university, reporters saw about 100 students chanting
slogans in favor of King Hussein and throwing rocks at about the
same number of students gathering to start a march to mark the
uprising anniversary.
   After retreating into the Engineering Association building, some
of the pro-PLO students emerged and battled the Jordanian
nationalists before security forces stopped the fighting.
   On Thursday, a Palestinian faction led by PLO dissident Atallah
Atallah packed a conference hall hours before the start of planned
lectures sponsored by the Professional Associations' Union and then
interrupted the speakers and clashed with Arafat supporters.
   About 200 of Atallah's followers arrived early Saturday for a
scheduled poetry reading in honor of the uprising, and Shubeilat
said the association canceled the event to avoid disturbances.
   He said folklore and musical programs planned for Sunday and
Monday also were canceled.
   Atallah opposes Arafat's leadership of the PLO and favors strong
ties with Jordan, which has granted his organization unusual freedom
of action. He denies PLO allegations he is backed by Jordan.
   Jordan has been under martial law since the 1967 war.
   Public demonstrations are rarely permitted, and Hussein's
government is wary of expressions of Palestinian nationalism since a
1970 war with Palestinian guerrillas that drove thousands of
Palestinian refugees into Lebanon.
   Hussein renounced sovereignty over the West Bank July 31,
formally giving the PLO responsibility for the area. He declared
that ``Jordan is not Palestine'' and called for Jordanian citizens
to honor their duties to their own country.

<HEAD>Daley And Jackson Top New Poll, But Jesse's Not A Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cook County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley
leads in the race for mayor, and presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
_ who isn't even in the running _ would be his toughest competitor,
a poll has found.
   Daley, son of the the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, would garner
52 percent of the vote while fellow Democrat Jackson would get 40
percent in a one-on-one race, according to the poll published in
Sunday editions of the Chicago Tribune.
   Voters polled also favored Daley over Mayor Eugene Sawyer and
Alderman Timothy Evans _ both black and considered strong contenders
_ and gave him the most favorable rating of the top five Democratic
candidates.
   Half of all blacks polled said no black candidate measures up to
former Mayor Harold Washington, whose death in November 1987 created
the need for the special election April 4. The Democratic primary is
set for Feb. 28. Only one Republican has announced his candidacy in
the largely Democratic city.
   The telephone poll of 1,038 registered Chicago voters found that
Sawyer and Evans both lack the broad support needed to re-create the
multiracial coalition that won the mayor's office twice for
Washington, the city's first black mayor. The city's population is
40 percent black.
   Jackson would have the best chance of regrouping the Washington
forces and beating Daley in a one-on-one confrontation, the poll
found.
   Asked opinions of candidates or possible candidates, 55 percent
of those polled gave Jackson, a civil rights leader and former
presidential candidate, a favorable rating. Daley was viewed
favorably by 59 percent, Sawyer by 43 percent and Evans by 39
percent.
   Jackson ``is not a candidate'' and won't comment on the poll,
press secretary Eric Easter said Saturday.
   Daley does not expect Jackson to enter the race, but ``obviously
if he (Jackson) were to run he'd be a strong candidate,'' said David
Wilhelm, Daley's campaign manager.
   The poll was conducted Dec. 2-5 by Market Shares Corp. of
suburban Mount Prospect and has an error margin of plus or minus 3
percent.
   In a two-way race against Sawyer, who is set to announce his
candidacy officially Sunday, Daley was favored by 59 percent
compared to 30 percent for the acting mayor. In a race with Evans,
Daley would win 56 percent to 34 percent, the poll found.
   Of blacks polled, 45 percent favored Sawyer over Daley, and 62
percent favored Evans over Daley.

   Barbra Streisand paid a record $363,000 Saturday
for an oak and wrought iron sideboard made by craftsman Gustav
Stickley, the top lot in an auction that brought in more than $1.9
million, Christie's auction house said.
   Streisand's telephone bid on the 1903 sideboard set a record for
a Stickley piece and for a single piece of American Arts and Crafts
movement furniture, said Christie's spokeswoman Dana Micucci. Before
the auction, its value was estimated at $90,000.
   The sideboard had been in Stickley's home in Syracuse, N.Y.,
before the designer's grandson, Peter Wiles Sr., put it up for
auction along with several other pieces from the house. Streisand
bought three other Stickley items and two Frank Lloyd Wright
drawings at the auction, said Micucci.
   A Stickley oak directors table sold to an unidentified New York
dealer for $121,000, and an inlaid oak piano and bench created by
Stickley and Harvey Ellis sold for $77,000, she said.
   Stickley, who died in 1942, is regarded as one of the leaders in
the field of American Arts and Crafts furniture.

<HEAD>Comatose Woman Gives Birth after Rare Medical Procedure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who has been in a coma for more than five
months gave birth to a healthy boy by Caesarian section after labor
was induced in a rarely used procedure, officials said Saturday.
   The 8-pound, one-half-ounce baby was delivered to Barbara
Blodgett, 24, of Yakima without complication late Friday, said Kay
Rodriguez of University Hospital.
   The mother, injured in a June 30 car wreck when she was three
months pregnant, was listed in satisfactory condition.
   David Blodgett, who escaped serious injury in the accident,
attended his wife during delivery, Rodriguez said. The couple met
while serving on a U.S. Forest Service firefighting crew, and
co-workers later donated vacation time so Blodgett could remain with
his wife.
   ``Her prognosis for recovery (from brain stem injuries) is very
guarded,'' said L.G. Blanchard, another hospital spokesman.
Blanchard said she was being fed intravenously but was breathing on
her own.
   Dr. Thomas Benedetti, a University of Washington medical
professor as well as Mrs. Blodgett's physician, said the induction
of labor in a comatose woman was relatively rare.
   Doctors used drugs to put the woman in labor after determining
that the baby's lungs were sufficiently developed. After five hours
of labor, however, it was clear the baby was too big for a regular
delivery so Caesarean surgery was performed, Rodriguez said.
   The accident killed Mrs. Blodgett's cousin, Nicole Valenzuela.
The driver of the other car, Byron Stackhouse, 37, was convicted of
vehicular assault after admitting he had been drinking before the
wreck. He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 3,000 people Saturday
demonstrated for more freedom in the first independent rally
permitted by Communist authorities in nearly 20 years.
   Dissidents who were detained to prevent their attendance at
banned demonstrations in August and October were cheered by the
crowd as they spoke at the rally.
   But former Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek, who was
ousted after his reform program was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion
in 1968, was placed under virtual house arrest Friday in Bratislava
when French President Francois Mitterrand Mitterrand visited that
city.
   Dubcek told reporters police cars circled his residence in
Bratislava Friday when Mitterrand, a socialist, was in the city and
he could not leave his home. His wife, Anna, said the police patrols
were removed Saturday.
   Mitterrand, during his two-day visit to Czechoslovakia that ended
Friday, praised Dubcek's attempted reforms that became known as the
``Prague Spring.''
   At Saturday's rally the crowd chanted ``Freedom!'' ``Release
political prisoners'' and ``Long live Charter 77'' during an hour of
speeches by activists from the Charter 77 human rights movement and
other dissident groups.
   The rally, called to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1948
Declaration of Human Rights, had been scheduled for Prague's
Wenceslas Square. Authorities barred the gathering in the city
center but approved of another site about a mile away.
   After the speeches the crowd shouted approval of resolutions,
including publication of the human rights declaration and other
human rights pacts in school texts, public participation in the
preparation of a new constitution, and negotiations with the
nation's churches for full religious freedom.
   It was the first time since January 1969 that the Communist
authorities had permitted a rally by independent groups.
   Banned playwright Vaclav Havel was the first to address the crowd.
   ``Three weeks ago, when I was in (Prague's) Ruzyne prison,
wondering how long I would be there, if anybody told me that I would
be having breakfast with the French president and the next day
addressing a permitted meeting, I would have said he was joking,''
he said.
   He said Saturday's rally would not have been possible without the
``brave participation'' of thousands of people in the August and
October demonstrations, which were broken up by police.
   Havel said he did not know if the permission for the rally marked
a major change by the authorities, but he said, ``One thing is
certain, the situation is open and it is up to us all how it is
going to develop.''
   Havel was one of eight dissidents who met with Mitterrand Friday
to discuss human rights.
   A government-sponsored forum on human rights also was held
Saturday at at an exhibition hall in a Prague park.
   The delegates approved the creation of committee on human affairs
that speakers said would improve laws on health and social affairs
and guarantee existing laws are not violated.
   But the organizers did not admit three dissidents who tried to
attend the forum.
   ``There are no rights and freedoms without the duty not to exceed
the determined borders,'' said keynote speaker Josef Mecl, dean of
the law faculty at Prague's Charles University.

<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. experts flew to Laos on
Saturday to find out what happened to an American pilot whose
single-seat reconnaissance aircraft went down during a March 1968
wartime mission.
   The excavation in the southern Laotian province of Savannakhet
will take about 10 days and involve 16 Americans and a number of
Laotian counterparts, said Lt. Col. Thomas J. Boyd, a spokesman for
the U.S. Pacific Command.
   The fourth joint excavation in Laos is part of an operation aimed
at resolving the fates of 547 U.S. servicemen still listed as
missing in action in the communist nation. The U.S. Department of
Defense also lists 1,747 MIAs in Vietnam, 83 in Cambodia and six in
China from the long war in Indochina.
   Boyd said the excavation was the result of a joint survey of the
Sepone area undertaken by U.S.-Laotian personnel in late September
and early October.
   Boyd said two U.S. C-130s flew the team Friday from Clark Air
Force Base in the Philippines to Bangkok. The aircraft flew on to
Vientiane, the capital of Laos, where the team was to be transported
to the remote crash site by helicopters.
   He said the team included explosive and ordnance experts, a
physician and a U.S. State Department official. Most of the team
members come from the Hawaii-based Joint Casualty Resolution Center
and Central Identification Laboratory, the units charged with
resolving the MIA issue.
   The three earlier joint investigations found no remains of U.S.
servicemen, but Boyd said the Laotians in February turned over
remains they said were found in searches of two sites in which
Americans did not participate.
   Boyd said an investigation to determine whether the remains were
those of Americans was continuing.

   Friends of popular music legend Roy
Orbison say memorial services will be held in Nashville and in Los
Angeles for the singer, who died last week of a heart attack.
   A public prayer service, organized by Grand Ole Opry star Jean
Shepard, is planned for Sunday afternoon at College Heights Baptist
Church in Nashville.
   Orbison, known for such hits as ``Blue Bayou'' and ``Only the
Lonely,'' died Tuesday in suburban Hendersonville at age 52. He had
lived in or near Nashville for 30 years until moving to California
three years ago.
   ``We just felt the need to get together and pray for him,'' Ms.
Shepard said Friday. ``Good friends are hard to come by and Roy was
a good friend.''
   She said the event was intended to be for Nashville musicians who
have worked with Orbison, but fans would not be turned away.
   ``It would be OK, I'm sure. Roy belonged to the people,'' she
said.
   In Los Angeles, a family spokesman, Greg Thompson of Sarah
McMullen Public Relations, said Orbison's burial would be closed to
the public.
   Also expected to be private is a gathering Tuesday at a Los
Angeles nightspot for Orbison's family and friends on the West
Coast, Thompson said. But a public memorial may be held later, he
said.

<HEAD>United Introduces New Business Discount Fare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines, which curtailed its cut-rate
fares just two weeks ago along with other carriers, added a discount
fare Saturday it said is aimed at the ``price-sensitive business
traveler.''
   The fare requires that travelers buy their tickets seven days in
advance. A 25 percent penalty will be assessed for canceling
reservations.
   The fare level, which went into effect Saturday, is lower than
the increased prices most U.S. airlines put into effect last month
for persons buying tickets a few days before their flights. But the
fare is still ``significantly higher'' than rates before the price
rise, Rob Doughty, a United spokesman, said Friday.
   ``There was a segment of the market that wasn't being addressed
by the new fares, but fares have to go up,'' he said. ``This was an
attempt to mesh those two needs.''
   United's non-stop one-way fare between Chicago and Los Angeles,
for example, drops from $525 to $362 with the new discount, compared
with $239 under the discount eliminated last month. The fare between
Denver and Los Angeles decreases from $320 to $272, compared with
$230 under the old discount fare.
   Although the price increases did not result in a decline in
traffic in the last two weeks, United was ``concerned that in the
long term we could see some impact,'' Doughty said.
   He predicted other carriers would follow United's changes.

   People from Tokyo to Washington on Saturday poured forth
sympathy, medical supplies, blankets, their own blood, and even
their holiday shopping money to help victims of the earthquake in
Soviet Armenia.
   In London, an elderly man emptied a jar with hundreds of coins on
to the counter of the Moscow Narodny Bank. Children turned up with
their holiday gift savings.
   ``We just never expected anything like this,'' said assistant
bank manager James Iglesias.
   The bank reported collecting about $462,000 in donations through
the day.
   In a hangar near London's Heathrow Airport, members of Britain's
15,000-member Armenian community sorted tons of clothes and blankets
donated by Britons.
   The United States mobilized its biggest relief effort in the
Soviet Union since World War II, when the two countries were allies.
   Expressions of sympathy and material aid continued to spring up
from across the globe. The official Soviet Tass news agency reported
on condolence messages and relief efforts in Spain, Brazil, Ecuador,
Canada, and Greece.
   Dozens of flights carrying rescue workers and equipment arrived
Saturday in Yerevan, capital of Armenia. Five arrived Friday from
France, Italy and Switzerland.
   In Washington, 26 U.S. disaster relief specialists flew to the
devastated region Saturday with eight dogs trained to sniff out
survivors buried in the rubble of Wednesday's earthquake. Tens of
thousands of people were reported killed, and a half million were
said to be homeless.
   ``It's exciting, tough work, for which it is necessary to steel
yourself to devastation that boggles the mind,'' said Bill Dotson,
44, of Charlottesville, Va., head of the dog team that included a
golden retriever named Rubble.
   The trip was organized by the U.S. State Department's Agency for
International Development. Private relief flights were leaving from
cities including New York, Boston, and Los Angeles.
   In Cuba, thousands crowded around blood banks early Saturday to
donate blood for the victims, the Cuban government news agency
Prensa Latina said.
   President Fidel Castro made a personal contribution of blood in
Havana, according to the official Soviet news agency Tass.
   Prensa Latina quoted one donor, Luz Reve, as saying, ``It's the
first time I'm going to donate blood and I don't know if they will
accept me because I'm anemic, but I want to try anyway because I
don't want to go without doing something for the Soviet people.''
   A plane left Cuba on Saturday with field hospital equipment,
medical specialists, plasma and food, the agency said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was to visit Cuba and
Britain on a three-nation tour, but he rushed home from New York on
Thursday in order to supervise relief operations.
   In Toyko, the government pledged $9 million in emergency aid,
press reports said Saturday, quoting government officials. The aid
was to include cash, as well as medicine, blankets and other
emergency supplies.

   Alla Pogosyan and her niece heard a
noise from a the fourth-floor of an apartment house, and the
building began to shake.
   ``I couldn't open the door,'' she recalled Saturday from a bed in
the hall of a hospital in Yerevan, capital of Armenia. ``I put up my
hand, and somebody took it.''
   She was no longer near the top of the five-story building in the
Armenian city of Stepanavan. She was near the top of a pile of
rubble in a devastated community.
   Unlike many others in similar buildings that Wednesday morning,
she survived an earthquake that devastated northwestern Armenia.
Tens of thousands were killed, but countless survivors were trapped
in the rubble. A half million people were estimated to be homeless.
   Ms. Pogosyan still doesn't know what happened to her niece.
   Another survivor at the Yerevan Surgical Institute, 9-year-old
Violetta Saliksyan, lay motionless in her bed, her bruised face
turned toward a weeping relative.
   She was home with her mother, father, grandfather and sister in
the Armenian city of Leninakan when the quake struck. Her mother and
grandmother died, and the rest of the family is now in three
hospitals.
   Five-hundred of the most seriously injured have been sent to the
Yerevan Institute.
   In its first official estimate, the government estimated Saturday
that 12,000 people were injured.
   Gradually, their relatives are finding them. At this hospital,
they are guided by typewritten lists of patients posted on the brick
walls outside.
   ``The entire staff since the seventh has not left the
institution, not a cleaning lady, not a doctor has left,'' said the
hospital's director, Alexander Mikhailyan.
   So far, 18 patients have died there, he said.
   But doctors are waging a battle against what they call ``crush
syndrome'' _ permanent physical damage from the pressure of huge
slabs of concrete and other debris.
   Chief surgeon Ruben Ovanasyan said crush syndrome has caused 14
of the 18 deaths. that.
   Doctors say they need more artificial kidney machines and
blood-filtering devices to save the seriously ill. Of the hospital's
500 patients, 48 are using its three kidney machines, seriously
overtaxing their capacity.
   Mikhailyan said 79 new patients were brought to the hospital
Saturday, mostly transferred from other hospitals. Meanwhile, it
sent 35 patients to a Yerevan cancer hospital and 31 to Moscow.
   ``We haven't seen this kind of situation in our halls,'' said
Mikhailyan. Hour by hour, green military helicopters buzzed almost
constantly overhead bringing more of the dead and injured to the
capital.

<HEAD>Award Recipients Say South African Concessions Are Only Skin-Deep</HEAD>

   South Africa's release of journalist Zwelakhe
Sisulu and better treatment of long-imprisoned black nationalist
leader Nelson Mandela are time-buying tactics by the white minority
government, members of Sisulu's family said Saturday.
   The relatives were in Atlanta to accept the third annual $100,000
Carter-Menil Human Rights Prize at the Carter Center.
   In remarks prepared for delivery at the ceremony Saturday night,
former President Jimmy Carter said that despite improvements in the
Middle East, Latin America and the Soviet bloc, ``I cannot really
say that the human rights conditions in the world have improved
significantly in 1988.''
   Sisulu, editor of the New Nation and one of South Africa's most
prominent black journalists, was arrested two years ago, hours after
new censorship laws were imposed. He was held without charges until
his unexpected release Dec. 2.
   Sisulu, 37, a former Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, is
under indefinite orders not to work for a newspaper, give
interviews, be in the presence of more than 10 people at once or
visit schools. He must report to police twice a day and stay at home
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
   ``The regime wants a pat on the back,'' said Max Sisulu, a
brother who is active in the banned African National Congress and
has lived in Zambia since 1963. ``They release some but they arrest
more. It will continue.''
   The restrictions, he said, are making his brother ``his own
jailer. It is the most vicious form of restraint. He is a journalist
and he cannot earn a living.''
   Their father, Walter, a former ANC official, has served 24 years
of a life sentence and remains jailed.
   Max Sisulu and sisters Lindiwe, who is studying in England, and
Beryl, who lives in Johannesburg, came to accept the award on behalf
of the family. They said the money likely would go to a trust fund
to help families of political prisoners.
   They urged international sanctions to try to halt South Africa's
policy of apartheid, or racial separation, peacefully if possible,
but Max Sisulu questioned whether it would work.
   ``When the regime closes peaceful avenues, what is left for the
people to do?'' he said in an interview. ``People are starting not
to see the government as a vehicle for change.''
   Carter, in a brief interview, said President-elect George Bush
may take a stronger stand against South Africa than President Reagan
has.
   Bush, he predicted, ``may not be so readily inclined to veto
political and economic restrictions the U.S. Congress would like to
put on South Africa.''
   He agreed with the Sisulus that apparent concessions to black
dissident leaders have been largely ``window-dressing.''
   Mandela, 70, recently was moved to a house on a prison farm after
being treated for tuberculosis. He was sentenced to life in prison
in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
   Dominique de Menil, a Houston philanthropist who funds the prize,
said ``the answer lies with the South African government'' as to
whether apartheid ends peacefully or through bloodshed.
   Carter and Ms. Menil picked the Sisulu family to win the award
from a list of candidates drawn up by a committee of human rights
representatives.
   Last year the award went to the a group called La Vicaria de la
Solidaridad of Santiago, Chile, for its work in human rights. In
1986, the award was shared by Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov and the
Mutual Support Group of Guatemala, which works with missing family
members of victims of political violence in that Central American
country.

   The United Nations chief accepted the Nobel
Peace Prize on behalf of U.N. peacekeeping troops on Saturday and
said their success illustrates a new mood of understanding and
common sense in the world.
   But the U.N. secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, also
said the peacekeepers' crucial mission is threatened because the
United States and other nations don't pay their dues to the world
body.
   ``Never before in history have military forces been employed
internationally not to wage war, not to establish domination and not
to serve the interests of any power or group of powers, but rather
to prevent conflict between peoples,'' Perez de Cuellar told an
audience that included King Olav V.
   Despite conflicts and terrible new weapons, ``collective
responsibility for peace can be evolved in a truly representative
international system,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``There is a new mood
of understanding and common sense.''
   His hands appeared to shake with emotion as he accepted the gold
medal and prize certificate from Egil Aarvik, chairman of the
Norwegian Nobel Committee. The peacekeeping forces are the first
military force ever to win the award.
   In a white-tie ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, five Americans
shared the science prizes with three West Germans, a Briton and a
Frenchman.
   Literature laureate Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt could not attend for
health reasons and was represented at the ceremony by two daughters.
He is the first Arab writer to win the prestigious award.
   Sweden's King, Carl XVI Gustaf, awarded the prize for physics to
Americans Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger.
   Lederman said the greatest benefit of the ``awesome tradition''
of the Nobel Prizes was to encourage greater public understanding of
the sciences. He quipped that it was the scientist's ``modest goal
to understand the universe.''
   Johann Diesenhofer, Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel, all West
Germans, received the chemistry award.
   Sir James Black of Britain shared the medicine prize with
Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings, both of the United
States, and Maurice Allais of France won the memorial prize in
economics.
   This year's prizes are worth $416,000 per category. For reasons
never explained, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel stipulated in
his will that the peace prize be awarded in Norway, and the other
prizes in Sweden.
   The first prizes were handed out in 1901, and the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economics was set up in 1968 by the National Bank of Sweden.
   An audience of 600 at Oslo University's Aula Hall observed a
moment of silence for the 733 peacekeepers who have died on duty.
   The first U.N. force went to the Middle East in 1948. Since then,
half a million soldiers from 58 countries have served in trouble
spots around the world, keeping combatants apart and monitoring
cease-fires.
   The U.N. has 10,000 soldiers in the field today, and Perez de
Cuellar noted that one of them, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins, is held by kidnapers in Lebanon. He appealed for Higgins'
release.
   On Friday, Perez de Cuellar accepted the money portion of the
award, worth $416,000, but said peacekeeping forces were threatened
by failure of the United States and other countries to pay their
U.N. dues.
   ``I don't know how we're going to cope financially,'' he told
reporters. U.N. members owe about $450 million in back dues, and the
United States is the biggest debtor with nearly $350 million
outstanding, he said.
   The Reagan administration has been holding back money from the
world body on grounds that is overstaffed, wasteful and has an
anti-Western bias.
   President Reagan has said the debt will be paid eventually, but
Perez de Cuellar suggested that could come too late.
   In addition to the seven peacekeeping missions now on duty,
additional forces have been suggested as early as next year for
South-West Africa, the Western Sahara, Afghanistan, Cambodia and
Central America.
   Perez de Cuellar said the forces act as an international police
force.
   ``Peacekeeping uses soldiers as servants of peace rather than as
the instruments of war. It introduces to the military sphere the
principle of non-violence,'' he said.
   ``We can, and must, achieve what we have dreamed of for so long,
that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the
exception in world affairs.''
   Afer the ceremony, Perez de Cuellar left for Paris to attend
ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights
Convention.

   Fighter jets bombed the southern
Afghan city of Kandahar this week and killed 24 people, Afghanistan
government radio reported Saturday.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islambad, did not say who the planes in
Thursday's attack belonged to. It said the bombers flew in from the
east, presumably from the direction of Pakistan.
   The radio provided sketchy details. It said the raid injured
eight people and damaged 10 houses. A military unit was also hit,
and eight soldiers and an officer were injured, it said.
   Radio Kabul also reported a car bomb exploded in the Afghan
capital Kabul early Saturday, injuring dozens of people with broken
glass from shattered windows.
   Kandahar, the ancient capital of Afghanistan, has been under
siege for several months by Moslem guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed government.
   Western diplomats, independent witness reports and guerrilla
sources reported seeing Soviet-made MiG-27 jets bombing guerrillas
positions around the city in late October and early November.
   Islamabad and Kabul have been trading charges of interference and
accord violations almost since the signing in April.
   Pakistan has denied repeated charges of armed interference in
Afghanistan levelled by the communist government in Kabul. The
United States and Pakistan support Moslem insurgents, who have been
fighting the Kabul government for the past 10 years.
   An agreement signed in April provides for the withdrawal of an
estimated 100,000 Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan signed the U.N.-brokered agreement,
which was co-guaranteed by Moscow and Washington.

   Gunmen killed five people in two
attacks over a 24-hour period in this southern city in an apparent
escalation of a regional Mafia war, police said Saturday.
   Gunmen fired through a window of a pizzeria in Reggio Calabria on
Friday night, killing three people and critically wounding two
others, authorities said.
   On Saturday morning, assailants gunned down a man and his
son-in-law at a gas station in the city, which is in the toe of
Italy's boot.
   Police said the killings were part of a war between the Imerti
and De Stefano clans, which are fighting for supremacy in the city.
The feud has claimed at least 200 lives in the past three years.
   The pizzeria attack killed Sebastiano Tale, 34, owner of the
shop, and two cousins, Guglielmo Brinzi, 32, and Paolo Brinzi, 27.
They were sitting at a small table next to a window with Demetrio
Milardi, 50, and Lida Marciano, 25, who were seriously wounded,
police said. A second woman suffered minor injuries, they said.
   On Saturday morning, gunmen armed with a submachine gun and an
automatic rifle killed contractor Paolo Surace, 49, as he sat behind
the wheel of his car at a gas station, police said.
   They then turned their fire on his son-in-law, Domenico
Cartisano, 34, who was in a truck parked alongside Surace's vehicle,
they said.
   The assailants jumped back into an automobile driven by a third
man and escaped, authorities said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said Surace was prominent in local
organized crime activity and had installed sophisticated security
systems in his home.
   The victims in both cases were linked to the Imerti clans, said a
police detective in Reggio Calabria, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The killings may have been in reprisal for the slaying
last fall of a prison inmate linked to the De Stefano clan, he said.

   Police arrested more than 500 people at anti-abortion protests
Saturday in California, Texas and Ohio as demonstrators sang hymns
and Christmas carols, drew hecklers and forced authorities to drag
them into custody.
   Almost 400 protesters were arrested outside Planned Parenthood
clinics in the Northern California communities of Concord and
Fairfield, police said.
   Police in Austin, Texas, arrested 85 people during a
demonstration outside The Ladies Center clinic, where abortions are
performed. Most of the protesters went limp, forcing officers to
carry them into three vans and a bus, a process that took more than
three hours in a chilly rain.
   In Columbus, Ohio, police arrested 52 anti-abortion activists as
they attempted to barricade the entrance to the Founders Clinic near
downtown.
   The anti-abortion protesters all were associated with Operation
Rescue, a group that has organized such demonstrations nationwide
and with particular impact in Atlanta during and since the
Democratic National Convention in July.
   Terri Conklin, a director of the Project Rescue spinoff group in
Ohio, said trained counselors were at the Columbus protest to advise
any women seeking abortions to go to ``pregnancy distress centers''
where, if they decided against abortion, they would be provided with
baby clothes and furniture.
   Columbus police said most of those arrested were charged with
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and taken to the county
jail. About half of the protesters passively resisted arrest by
refusing to walk and had to be carried to a police van.
   In Concord, Calif., police Lt. Bob Burns said 184 people there
were cited for trespassing on private property and released.
   Kelly Connelly of Operation Rescue said about 320 anti-abortion
participants drew about 75 pro-choice protesters in Concord.
   ``They were making a lot of noise and kind of harrassing the
`rescuers,''' said Burns. But police said none of the
counter-demonstrators were arrested.
   ``It was all very gentlemanly,'' said Burns.
   Fairfield Police Lt. Jerry Shepard said 215 people were arrested,
processed and released at a similar demonstration involving close to
400 people at a Planned Parenthood clinic there.
   In Austin, Lt. David Balagia said police expected to file
criminal trespass charges against most of the protesters arrested
Saturday. There were also arrests in Austin on Friday, when 34
people were charged with criminal trespass after they blocked the
entrances to two clinics.
   Rex Moses, a spokesman for the organizing group Austin Rescue and
one of those arrested Saturday, said he was proud of the protesters
arrested in Friday's actions, but added that he did not want to
``gloat'' in front of police.
   The Texas Abortion Rights Action League said the four protests
staged by Austin Rescue since October cost the city $29,000 in
police overtime expenses. The clinic had three abortions scheduled
for Saturday, and all were rescheduled, said league executive
director Phyllis Dunham.

   Tourists can walk cobblestone streets
and see buildings standing since this seaport's whaling days, but
the slayings of at least five women this year have focused
outsiders' attention on seedy Weld Square.
   Five bodies of women have been found dumped along highways since
July, and three have been identified and linked to the square, an
area known for drugs and prostitution a few blocks from the historic
section.
   Saturday, skeletal remains of a sixth body were found in the
area, but police did not immediately determine whether they were
part of the string of killings.
   Police said at least one of the women whose bodies were found
earlier was strangled. The victims' skeletal remains have been sent
to the FBI for examination.
   While dozens of investigators comb the region for more bodies and
for any suspects, prostitutes still walk the streets of Weld Square
day and night.
   ``I'm worried, yeah, but I've got to make a living,'' said one
woman who said she was a prostitute and declined to give her name.
   Mayor John Bullard said the killings have not frightened most
townspeople.
   ``The people who have reason to be terrified are the prostitutes.
But that is a very small, very identifiable problem,'' Bullard said.
``There is no reason for people who are not prostitutes to feel
threatened by this.''
   In fact, the mayor said he is more concerned with the city's drug
problem.
   ``The biggest problem is the waste of human lives that takes
place off the front pages,'' Bullard said. ``That's a much greater
impact than five people having their lives taken.''
   In nearby Dartmouth, police said that skeletal remains located
Saturday were found by hunters in a gravel pit about a quarter-mile
into the woods off Interstate 195. The other five bodies found since
July were within 25 feet of the interstate or Route 140 in Dartmouth
and Freetown.
   Neither the body's sex nor the cause of death could be
immediately determined, authorities said. Police gave no indication
they had any evidence other than proximity to link the body to the
five slayings.
   The killings have added a new chapter to the town's troubled
history.
   A city of highs and lows, New Bedford was once the whaling
capital of the world. That industry rapidly collapsed and textile
manufacturing swiftly took its place. Then the mills migrated south
toward cheaper labor earlier this century, leaving an economic wound
in New Bedford that has only recently begun to heal.
   Today, despite higher-than-average unemployment and a polluted
harbor, this city of 98,000 about 50 miles south of Boston boasts
the nation's richest fishing port in the dollar value of its catch.
   But more people remember the city for the 1983 gang rape of a
woman on a pool table at a bar called Big Dan's in the city's
scruffy South End. The case resulted in four convictions and
national television and newspaper coverage.
   Earlier this summer, as the first bodies in the murder case were
discovered in dense woods near two highways, a movie based on the
Big Dan's case drew protests from some residents.
   Efforts to improve New Bedford and its image have taken many
forms.
   The New Bedford Whaling museum is famous across the country. The
mayor is trying to bring a state park to the city. The downtown area
has preserved its appearance and one can walk for blocks on
cobblestone streets among whaling-era buildings.
   Not far from downtown, Joe Thomas works on a periodical devoted
to New Bedford's history. It is called ``Spinners,'' after the
millworkers who flocked to the city at the turn of the century. He
said he worries about problems more permanent than the series of
murders.
   ``I am concerned with the way people see themselves. I don't care
what other people think,'' Thomas said. He said New Bedford ``has a
pretty low wage level; it's got a pretty low housing level; it's got
a pretty low education level.''
   James Mathes, executive vice president of the New Bedford Area
Chamber of Commerce, said the city will be able to recover from the
latest round of bad news by ``going out and telling people that this
is a nice community.''
   ``Murder is clearly a terrible thing. It happens throughout the
United States,'' he said. ``But when you have something this wacky,
that happens multiple times, it just hurts.''

   Someone identifying himself as boxing legend
Muhammad Ali has made hundreds of phone calls to politicians and
journalists, asking for help on three projects, one potentially
worth millions to Ali, according to a newspaper report.
   Ali, in a face-to-face interview, told The Atlanta Journal and
The Atlanta Constitution he did not make the phone calls, and had no
idea who did, the newspaper reported in Sunday editions. ``Why would
a Black Muslim mess with politicians?'' Ali said. ``I don't care.''
   Many of the ``Ali'' calls to journalists were arranged by his
attorney, Richard M. Hirschfeld of Charlottesville, Va., the
newspaper said. It quoted business associates of Ali and Hirschfeld
as saying the lawyer does a convincing impersonation of the former
heavyweight champion.
   The newspaper said its attorneys sent a list of questions to
Hirschfeld, including one asking whether he had ever impersonated
Ali's voice to a third party.
   Hirschfeld, in a letter, did not answer the questions, but
instead said that Ali denied making statements the newspaper
attributed to him, including the statement denying that he knew
anything about the phone calls, the paper said.
   A call Saturday from The Associated Press to Hirschfeld's office
was not returned.
   The newspaper reported that ``the Ali voice'' this year has
called at least six U.S. senators, two administrative assistants, 10
press secretaries, nine journalists, 14 senatorial aides,
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr.,
counsel to President Reagan.
   In calls to the powerful in Washington, ``the Ali voice'' pushed
these three projects, the newspaper reported:
   _An assistant attorney general's job for University of Virginia
law professor Stephen Saltzburg, a friend and occasional legal
associate of Hirschfeld.
   _A Justice Department investigation of a federal prosecutor in
Norfolk, Va., who had completed a case against a former Hirschfeld
business associate and was investigating Hirschfeld.
   _A bill in Congress saying Ali could sue again on a lawsuit he
had lost, seeking $50 million in damages from his wrongful
conviction in his 1967 draft evasion case. Hirschfeld was an
attorney in that lawsuit. The first draft of that legislation, which
failed last September, was written by Saltzburg at Hirschfeld's
request, according to U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who proposed
the legislation.
   In phone calls to senators and journalists, ``the phone Ali'' was
``witty, articulate and intelligent,'' showing knowledge and
political savvy on subjects as diverse as foreign policy, fair
housing and the Democratic Party's Dixiecrat uprising of 1948, the
newspaper reported.
   But Ali, 46, twice has been diagnosed as suffering from brain
damage from his 27 years in the ring. In many public appearances in
recent years, he has spoken hesitatingly, often in a slurred whisper.
   Ali, accompanied by Hirschfeld, has made a number of personal
appearances in Washington this year, visiting the offices of five
senators who had spoken with ``the Ali telephone imposter,'' the
newspaper reported. During these visits, Ali shook hands, signed
autographs and made small talk, mostly in whispered phrases, the
paper said.
   The newspaper noted media coverage of Ali this year _ including a
June 9 page-one story in The Washington Post, based on ``a rare
telephone interview,'' detailing his stands on politicians from
Strom Thurmond and Jesse Jackson to Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The Atlanta story also quoted several Ali associates as doubting
that the former champ could expound at length on the issues of the
day.
   ``Ali is a simple man,'' said his former fight doctor, Dr. Ferdie
Pacheco.
   ``If you accept him as naive, it doesn't take anything for
unscrupulous people to talk their way into him, to use him as a
front and use his name. ... Politics? Foreign policy? He knows about
foreign policy?''
   Milton Coleman, an assistant managing editor at the Washington
Post, said Saturday that Hirschfeld had told a Post reporter that
she would be allowed to interview Ali face to face. But the attorney
later told her that the interview couldn't take place at that time,
and said Ali would be calling, according to Coleman.
   Shortly afterward, a man identifying himself as Ali called, and
the interview took place on the telephone. It was the evening of
June 7.
   On the following day, Hirschfeld assured the reporter and an
editor in separate interviews that it was Ali who talked during the
previous night's interview, Coleman said.
   After reading a political interview ostensibly given by Ali, Ali
intimate Lloyd Wells said, ``Ali is not capable of that kind of
political rhetoric. ... I bet my life there's no way Ali sat down
and uttered that rhetoric.''

   Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari
promised visiting U.S. congressmen that he will make life miserable
for drug traffickers in Mexico, the lawmakers said Saturday.
   The congressmen said they were optimistic about the new Mexican
administration's attitude toward the battle against drugs after a
40-minute meeting with Salinas on Friday.
   The 14 lawmakers, members of the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, are on a 12-day fact-finding trip to
Mexico and other nations in the Caribbean basin.
   Two years ago, on a similar fact-finding trip, committee chairman
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said he was disappointed by what he
perceived as lack of cooperation by Mexican officials.
   Salinas, who took office Dec. 1, told the congressmen he was
reorganizing the office of the attorney general with a special
narcotics enforcement division and planned to implement stiffer
criminal penalties and increase seizure of assets of drug dealers.
   ``I will make life miserable for drug traffickers in Mexico,
before they make life in Mexico miserable,'' the congressmen quoted
Salinas as saying.
   The congressmen said Salinas gave no specifics about how he
planned to step up the fight against official corruption or any
details of the use of seizure laws.
   Mexico has in the past expressed discontent with U.S. drug
policies, saying that they lean too much toward enforcement and that
Mexico cannot be blamed for the tremendous demand for drugs that
creates a market in the United States.
   Rangel said U.S. policy has recently shifted to an emphasis on
education, treatment and rehabilitation, rather than simply
enforcement.
   ``We have an upbeat attitude as to looking forward to the new
relationship betwen our presidents and our congresses,'' said Rangel.
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said Mexican authorities
expressed interest in reviewing U.S. statutes on money laundering
and bank privacy, but he did not know how they planned to use the
information.
   ``We've made errors and mistakes and we hope Mexico can benefit
from them,'' said Rep. Frank J. Guarini, D-N.J.
   Salinas said he personally intervened to press an investigation
into the killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar, said Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio.
   Oxley said he told Salinas that a speedy resolution of the
Camarena case ``would send a positive signal'' about the Mexican
attitude on drug trafficking.
   Camarena was killed in 1985 while investigating Rafael Caro
Quintero, allegedly one of Mexico's top drug barons.
   A Mexican drug trafficker, Rene Verdugo Urquidez, was convicted
in Los Angeles and sentenced to 240 years in prison in the case in
October. His attorneys argued that he was a scapegoat.
   Caro Quintero has been sentenced to 34 years in prison in Mexico
on narcotics and weapons charges stemming from the case.
   Several other people, including Mexican police officials, have
been convicted in the case. U.S. authorities have accused Mexico of
foot-dragging in the investigation, causing strains in U.S.-Mexican
relations.
   The next stop on the delegation's tour is Belize, just south of
Mexico. The delegation's itinerary after that is not yet set,
committee staff members said.
   Committee staffer Rich Baum refused to comment on reports the
delegation is going to Cuba, but he said the island was of interest
because of its strategic location between the United States and
drug-producing areas in South America.
   He said the United States had tracked drug-carrying planes and
ships that appeared to originate in Cuba.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro last week rejected accusations that
Cuba was serving as a drug transshipment point and said that his
nation was the most drug-free nation in the Western Hemisphere.

   A fire in a two-story apartment-hotel
Saturday night killed three people and injured one, authorities said.
   All of the 20 firefighters on duty in the southwestern Ohio city
and a number of off-duty personnel were called in to fight the blaze
at the Baltimore Inn, said assistant Fire Chief Roger South.
   ``We're still fighting it. They've got a lot of fire down
there,'' South said about an hour and a half after the fire was
reported around 7 p.m.
   The building housed a hotel, tavern and restaurant. The three
people who were killed and the one who was injured were believed to
be the only ones remaining in the building when police arrived, a
police dispatcher said.
   The identities of the victims and the cause of the fire were not
immediately known, South said.
   The injured person was taken to Middletown Regional Hospital. A
nursing supervisor said the victim did not appear to be badly hurt,
but was being examined.
   Middletown is a city of about 45,000 north of Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Report: Two Planned To Acquire Soviet Tank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security aide Oliver North and
the late Amiram Nir had planned to acquire a highly sophisticated
Soviet tank in Syria and have it shipped to the United States, a
published report said Saturday.
   U.S. News & World Report, quoting unnamed intelligence sources
and referring to North's still secret notebooks, called for Israel
to send an Arabic speaking arms expert with a fake Syrian passport
into that country with the help of ``unnamed Polish confederates.''
   The goal of the expedition was an advanced version of the Soviet
Union's T-72 high-tech battle tank, the magazine said in its
``Washington Whispers'' column. The plan, in which the tank would be
shipped to the United States ``via a circuitous route,'' was aborted
because of disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986,
the magazine said.
   Nir, a former Israeli counterterrorism official, died Nov. 30 in
a plane crash in Mexico.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev consoled
survivors and urged on rescuers during a visit Saturday to Armenia,
where an earthquake killed at least 40,000 people, trapped countless
others and left half a million homeless.
   ``We all, the whole of the country, share your sorrow,'' the
official Tass news agency quoted Gorbachev as saying in the southern
Soviet republic, where the quake hit Wednesday.
   ``You can be sure that every effort will be made to give you the
necessary help in full measure,'' he said. ``The most important
thing now is to search for and rescue all possible survivors.''
   Rescue workers climbed over piles of rubble from shattered
buildings, listening for voices of trapped people.
   The government released its first authoritative estimate of the
casualties from the earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale. Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Nikiforov told a Moscow news
conference that 40,000 to 45,000 people were killed and that 12,000
were hurt.
   In Yerevan, Armenia's capital, 500 of the injured were
hospitalized in the Yerevan Surgical Insitute.
   ``The entire staff since the seventh has not left the
institution,'' said the hospital's director, Alexander Mikhailyan.
   Visitors to Yerevan heard the constant buzzing of helicopters
traveling from the disaster area 50 miles northwest to ferry dead
and wounded.
   A small group of foreign reporters, the first allowed into
Armenia since Wednesday's earthquake, saw roads around Yerevan's
Zvarnots Airport clogged with relief vehicles. Fog slowed emergency
airlifts of supplies from throughout the Soviet Union and abroad.
   College students who helped in the rescue returned to Yerevan
with tales of vast destruction.
   ``Five homes remain in Spitak. That is all. The rest are
destroyed. You can't describe it. You have to see it,'' Arsen
Minasyan, a student at an agricultural institute, said in an
interview with The Associated Press. Spitak is a city of about
16,000 people.
   Another student, Tanya Kezorkian, a New Yorker going to school in
Yerevan, watched rescue attempts outside a computer institute in
Leninakan, a city of 250,000 people. ``In four hours, they took four
people out. But they say there were 250 people in there. That is the
pattern,'' she said.
   The national TV news program Vremya began its broadcast with
somber music and shots of the red state flag flying at half-staff at
the snow-covered Kremlin. Dozens of black and white coffins were
piled near an airplane, and a man sobbed hysterically as two
assistants helped him walk.
   Still photographs showed Gorbachev and his wife Raisa, with
expressions of shock on their faces, visiting the disaster area and
comforting survivors and speaking to some of the thousands of
rescuers.
   Gorbachev, who cut short a U.S. visit Thursday, arrived in
Armenia on Saturday to oversee the disaster relief. He drove by
ruined homes, public buildings and factories in Leninakan, near the
epicenter of the quake.
   ``We need first and foremost machinery! We don't have enough
powerful cranes,'' Tass quoted one man as shouting to Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev said other Soviet cities were prepared to take in
50,000 survivors. He called for evacuating women and children and
for all men to help in rescue operations.
   Tass interviewed Vanik Shemoyan, a sugar factory engineer in
Spitak.
   ``My youngest son, along with all his classmates, perished during
a class,'' he said. ``In other families, children have been
orphaned. I took two such kids, and I will try to become a good
father to them.''
   Soviets observed a day of mourning by affixing black ribbons to
Soviet flags, donating blood and preparing beds in thousands of
hotels, camps and homes to take in survivors.
   In London, the Sunday Telegraph quoted Ambartsum Galstian, a
member of the Karabakh Commmittee, as saying half the Armenian
nationalist group's 11 leaders were arrested Saturday.
   The committee is the major organization campaigning for
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic Armenian
region in the neighboring Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The ethnic
turmoil has sent thousands of Armenians fleeing Azerbaijan for
Armenia in recent weeks.
   Yuri P. Chaplygin, Council of Ministers spokesman, said nearly
7,000 people were hospitalized from the quake, many with burns and
crushed limbs.
   The Soviet Union sent 500 of its best doctors to Yerevan, and 200
medical teams fanned out across rural parts of the disaster area.
Construction experts, helicopters, massive cranes, food, fuel and
tents also were being rushed to the area from throughout the country.
   Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov told Tass the area looked like
a war front.
   Tent cities were set up to house a half million people left
homeless, and people huddled around bonfires to keep warm in
40-degree weather.
   In Leninakan, more than three-quarters of the houses were
destroyed, and the city of Spitak has been written off as a total
loss, Chaplygin told reporters.
   ``Spitak won't be restored because there is nothing left to
restore,'' he said. ``A new city will be built on the same spot.''
   Igor Nersesov, a Soviet seismologist, told reporters an
investigation had been launched into why so few buildings withstood
the quake.
   Nikiforov said 1,500 people were rescued from the ruins on Friday
after two full days of being trapped. A French team equipped with
infrared equipment to detect warm bodies saved 60 lives, he said.
   The French aid was part of a major international airlift of
people and supplies. Five flights arrived in Yerevan on Friday, from
France, Italy and Switzerland. Dozens more were arriving Saturday.

   Lech Walesa and Andrei Sakharov met for the first
time Saturday and discussed human rights problems in their homelands
and the reforms they believed are needed to correct them, an adviser
to Walesa said.
   The two men, both making their first foreign trip since each won
the Nobel Peace Prize, also attended ceremonies marking the 40th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   Elsewhere Saturday, police clashed with demonstrators calling for
human rights in Tibet and Paraguay, and the leaders of nations such
as Cyprus and the Philippines issued statements calling for an end
to human rights abuses.
   In Prague, Czechoslovakia, an estimated 3,000 people demonstrated
for more freedom in the first independent rally permitted by
Communist authorities in nearly 20 years. They chanted slogans and
heard an hour of speeches by activists from the Charter 77 human
rights movement and other dissident groups.
   Walesa, leader of Poland's banned Solidarity labor movement, and
Sakharov, the Soviet human rights activist, met privately at their
hotel for about 45 minutes Saturday morning in a ``very friendly and
very warm'' session, according to Bronislaw Gemerek, an adviser to
Walesa who is acting as translator.
   ``Walesa spoke of the problems in Poland. Sakharov spoke of the
problems in the Soviet Union, and Walesa said he thinks
`perestroika' is a good program for both countries,'' said Gemerek,
speaking in French to reporters.
   Perestroika is the word used to describe Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's program of political or economic restructuring.
   Neither Walesa nor Sakharov commented publicly on their meeting
Saturday. But Gemerek later described the encounter in detail in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   Sakharov told Walesa that ``the immense difference between the
Russian and Polish societies is that Polish society wants reform,
while in the Soviet Union people fear it,'' Gemerek said.
   ``Walesa emphasized to Sakharov that the main problem is the
democratization of the system. When you have mass support, you can
have reform. Without the democraticization of the old Stalinist
system, Gorbachev's policies ... will always be vulnerable.''
   Gemerek said Solidarity planned to step up contacts with
independent Soviet movements and activists. He also said Walesa and
Sakharov hoped to meet again during the weekend.
   Walesa and Sakharov also met separately with Premier Michel
Rocard at his Left Bank office on Saturday.
   About 1,000 people packed the great hall Saturday night at the
Palais de Chaillot, which looks across the Seine River to the Eiffel
Tower. They heard the global pledge to protect human rights that was
signed 40 years ago.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier-Perez de Cuellar and Director
General Federico Mayor of the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization made speeches. The audience included Eli
Weisel, another Nobel Peace Prize winner; Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich Genscher of West Germany; and Hortense Allende, widow of
slain President Salvador Allende of Chile.
   In his address, French President Francois Mitterrand stressed the
importance of the free flow of information in assuring liberty.
   ``Oppression is nourished by silence,'' he said. ``Free
information is a weapon in our hands.''
   The Paris trip was the first time Walesa has been allowed to
leave Poland since authorities crushed Solidarity during martial law
in 1981 and outlawed it in 1982. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1983 following the creation of Solidarity, the first independent
trade federation in a communist state.
   Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, came to Paris
after a four-week visit to the United States.
   Sakharov, a nuclear physicist who played a key role in developing
the Soviet hydrogen bomb, previously was barred from traveling
abroad because the Soviets said his scientific work gave him
knowledge of state secrets.
   For seven years, he was also restricted to the closed city of
Gorky because of his outspoken opposition to Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
   But in 1986, Gorbachev called him back to Moscow. Since then,
Sakharov has generally supported Gorbachev's reforms, while speaking
out against some trends, including the growing concentration of
power in Gorbachev's hands.
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N.
General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic document under which
U.N. member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolish
torture and slavery.
   In Asuncion, Paraguay, police attacked hundreds of people with
electric prods and rubber batons Saturday to prevent them from
holding a march to commemorate the the human rights anniversary.
   Several dozen people were reported injured when police charged
demonstrators and people shopping in downtown Asuncion. The
government banned the march, saying it was organized by
anti-government activists.
   Also Saturday, Chinese troops fired on Tibetan demonstrators
marking the annniversary in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. Western
travelers said they believed two people were killed and three
wounded.
   In the Philippines, President Corazon Aquino vowed Saturday to
punish human rights violators in the military, saying soldiers who
abuse prisoners are capable of plotting coups against her.

   A body found nearly three years ago in
Sutter County has been linked to Dorothea Montalvo Puente, the
landlady already a suspect in the deaths of seven people whose
bodies were found around her rooming house, police said.
   Police arrested Ismael Carrasco Florez on Saturday and said he
built a wooden box and helped Puente put a body in it and deposit it
in Sutter County nearly three years ago.
   Capt. Michael O'Kane said no more information about Florez will
be made available until a Sunday morning news conference.
   A decomposed female body about 55 years old was found by a farm
worker on New Year's Day 1986 along the Sacramento River near the
town of Verona, about 15 miles northeast of Sacramento. The body was
wrapped in plastic.
   Police on Friday said they were working with Sutter County
sheriff's deputies concerning the body because of similarities in
the way it and the seven bodies unearthed in Puente's rooming house
yard were wrapped.
   Puente, charged with one count of murder, is in the county jail.
Last month, police dug up seven bodies from the yard of the downtown
Victorian house where she took in elderly, disabled or alcoholic
tenants.
   Police say Social Security and welfare checks sent to boarders
who were missing were nevertheless cashed.
   On Friday, police disclosed the identities of two more victims,
both former tenants of Puente. That brings to four the number of
victims who have been identified.
   The bodies of Dorothy Miller, 65, and Vera Martin, 65, were
identified through medical X-ray evidence, said O'Kane. Identified
earlier were Ben Fink, 55, and Alvaro ``Bert'' Montoya, 52. Puente
has been charged with homicide in Montoya's death.
   Sacramento police say they have not yet been able to determine
the cause of death for any of the seven.

   The blowtorch Santa Ana wind calmed Saturday
after driving flames that destroyed or damaged more than 60 homes,
but firefighters said drought-dry hillside brush will remain a
threat until it rains.
   Firefighters doused lingering hot spots by early evening in the
most recent blaze, which burned 40 homes, caused $4.3 million damage
and charred 3,200 acres of brush in the San Fernando Valley, said
Fire Department spokesman Gil Espinoza.
   ``It's out, kaput, history,'' Espinoza said. No firefighters
remained at the scene by early evening, he said.
   The cause of that blaze in the fashionable Porter Ranch
subdivision, remained under investigation, Espinoza said. The blaze
Friday destroyed 14 houses and a mobile home and damaged 25 houses,
officials said.
   Two other wind-fanned fires destroyed 22 homes Thursday in the
suburbs of La Verne and Baldwin Park, but a damage estimate had not
been completed, officials said.
   The drop in the wind Saturday removed only one element from the
potential for disastrous fires, said county Fire Inspector Elvin
Miranda.
   ``We have had drought conditions for the past two years,'' he
said. ``This causes the fuel (brush) moisture to drop.''
   Because so many years have passed between fires, some areas have
brush stacked up to 25 feet high, he added.
   From July 1 to Dec. 10, Los Angeles received just 0.79 of an inch
of rain, compared to 4.69 inches last year, said Bill Hoffer of the
National Weather Service in Los Angeles.
   Normal precipitation for the period is about 3 inches, but Hoffer
noted that even in the best of times, Southern California gets only
12 to 14 inches annually.
   The chaparral brush covering Southern California hillsides _
mostly manzanita, scrub oak and mountain mahogany _ is especially
explosive because it has adapted to drought by covering its leaves
with a volatile resin to retain moisture.
   A square mile of chaparral that hasn't burned for 30 years holds
about 25,000 tons of dry, resinous wood, a fuel that firefighters
often liken to an equivalent amount of gasoline.
   When wind drives fire into such heavy brush, witnesses have seen
hillsides explode into flame, with burning boughs hurled skyward.
   ``It was raining fire, just orange everywhere,'' said Porter
Ranch resident Eric Struthoff, whose home Friday was reduced to a
brick chimney and barbecue.
   City Fire Chief Donald Manning said many of the burned houses had
wood shingle roofs, which he called ``a disaster waiting to
happen.'' Untreated wood shingles are prohibited on new homes in
fire-prone areas of the city, but the code is only a few years old
and not retroactive.
   The northeasterly Santa Ana winds began blowing from the desert
Wednesday at 30 to 70 mph, but by Saturday ``most stations reported
calm,'' Hoffer said.
   The Santa Ana winds are typically caused when a high-pressure
system forms over the northern Rocky Mountain states while a
low-pressure system hovers over Baja California.
   Air rushing across the Western deserts from high to low pressure
heats up and dries out, and then roars through the passes of
mountains around the Los Angeles basin.

   A fire destroyed a closed amusement
park on a Boardwalk pier and a row of seaside businesses Saturday
and briefly threatened a casino hotel before being brought under
control, authorities said.
   ``It looks like the whole thing is up (in flames), all the
amusements, all the gaming houses,'' said fire Deputy Chief Lincoln
Harold. ``When this fire gets done running its course, there won't
be hardly anything left on the pier.''
   The Resorts International Casino Hotel, which owns the pier and
is located about 75 feet away, was never close to catching fire,
officials said. However, firefighters began their assault on the
flames at the hotel to ensure they would not spread in the hotel's
direction.
   The four-alarm blaze broke out at the Steeple Chase Pier
amusement park at Pennsylvania Avenue and the Boardwalk about 11:40
a.m. It was brought under control by midevening but was expected to
continue smoldering into the night.
   One firefighter was treated at a local hospital for a knee injury
and released, authorities said.
   A fast-food restaurant was destroyed, along with a row of
abandoned restaurants and arcades on the pier.
   Coleen O'Donnell, manager of Popeye's Fried Chicken, said that
she noticed flames coming up from the building's footing about 11:45
a.m.
   ``It came from outside the building,'' she said. ``We smelled it
and we looked and we saw it coming from the bottom of the walls.''
She said that she and about eight other people in the building
``went right out the front door.''
   The cause of the fire had not been determined, Harold said.
   More than 125 firefighters, five fire engines and two trucks
battled the blaze, which was largely confined to on the
100-foot-wide, 120-foot-long pier, which is surrounded on three
sides by water and the beach.
   Harold said problems getting water out to the pier and wind
helped the fire spread initially and slowed efforts to control it.
Late Saturday, freezing temperatures hampered firefighters.
   The Trump Air helicopter pad at the landward end of the pier was
closed, and scheduled flights to and from New York City were
re-routed to Bader Field, Atlantic City's airport, said Robert
Shamberg, the manager on duty at Resorts International.
   The amusement pier, built in 1892, was destroyed by fire on Feb.
14, 1932, and rebuilt. It has been closed since 1986.
   Fires have plagued all the amusement piers built during the
city's heyday as a seaside resort around the turn of the century. In
1987, the Brigantine Castle Pier, a haunted amusement house, was
destroyed by fire.
   The Steel Pier, which is parallel to the Steeple Chase Pier, has
also been damaged by fires since its opening in 1898.

   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,
who has pleaded ill health while putting off court appearances,
remained hospitalized Saturday after suffering what aides said was
congestive heart failure.
   St. Francis Medical Center nursing supervisor Mildred Kim said
Marcos, 71, was in guarded condition and was stable late Saturday
afternoon. Earlier advisories had said that he was in guarded
condition.
   She declined to elaborate, except to say, ``He's improved some.
He's stable.''
   St. Francis officials had said that more information on Marcos'
condition and diagnosis would be released Saturday morning, after
results of tests became known. However, hospital nursing supervisor
Mary Kravutske said that doctors were too busy to meet reporters.
   She read a brief statement: ``Marcos is in stable condition, he
is resting comfortably and he will remain in the hospital. Period.''
   Doctors have refused to release any information beyond saying
Marcos did not suffer a heart attack and did not require surgery.
Congestiv heart failure means the heart is unable to pump as much
blood as the body requires.
   Even before he was hospitalized Friday, Marcos was the subject of
legal proceedings over whether he is too sick to travel to New York
for arraignment on federal racketeering charges. His wife, Imelda,
pleaded innocent in an appearance in October, shortly after the
indictment was handed up, and is free on bond.
   A cardiologist who examinded Marcos for a federal judge in New
York reported that although Marcos suffers various ailments, he was
well enough to travel to New York for arraignment. The report said
Marcos repeatedly faked pain during a three-hour examination.
   Mrs. Marcos returned to the hospital Saturday. When she emerged,
she told reporters her husband was in poor health, adding, ``You
don't need a doctor, an expert, to know he is in pain.''
   Messages left at the office and home of Marcos' cardiologist, Dr.
Calvin Wong, seeking elaboration on his condition were not
immediately returned Saturday.
   However, Marcos aide Arturo Ariuza said Marcos had been suffering
chest pains for the past three weeks, but did not want to be
hospitalized because he believed he would be accused of faking.
   ``He had a heart irregularity, and that can be pretty serious,''
said hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop, who was asked to comment Friday
on the possibility that Marcos could be faking.
   The exiled leader, ousted from power in February 1986, developed
chest pains after he became distressed over concern for his
daughter, Imee Manotoc, who suffered complications during childbirth
Friday in Morocco, where she lives, said Marcos spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad.
   Marcos was taken to the hospital by ambulance Friday and
underwent tests, including an electrocardiogram, Kop said.
   He was admitted shortly after noon and by midafternoon doctors
had stabilized his heartbeat, Kop said. He joked with nurses and sat
up to eat, she said.
   Marcos aides alerted the news media that he would be going to the
hospital and delayed his departure from the Marcoses' Makiki Heights
estate for several minutes so photographers could take pictures.
   Marcos spent several days at the hospital in May after suffering
chest pains.

<HEAD>US Disaster Relief Experts, Rubble-Sniffing Dogs Fly to Soviet
Armenia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts lede and SUBS 7th graf, Members of..., to UPDATE with

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-six American disaster relief specialists
arrived Saturday in devastated Soviet Armenia with eight dogs
trained to sniff out survivors buried in the rubble of an earthquake
that killed tens of thousands of people.
   The flight was part of the biggest U.S. relief effort in the
Soviet Union since World War II. Americans provided limited
assistance after the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor at
Chernobyl in the Soviet Ukraine in 1986.
   ``It's exciting, tough work, for which it is necessary to steel
yourself to devastation that boggles the mind,'' said Bill Dotson,
44, of Charlottesville, Va., head of the dog team that included a
golden retriever named Rubble.
   Dotson, a pharmaceutical biologist, said the rescue workers must
brace themselves for ``pieces of steel twisted like spaghetti'' by
the earthquake ``and the constant odor of death.''
   Dotson has been working with canine rescue teams for 15 years,
and helped search for survivors of the 1986 earthquake in El
Salvador. Other members of his team took part in relief efforts
stemming from the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City, mudslides in
Puerto Rico and Colombia and flooding in West Virginia.
   ``You get hooked on it. At first it is training the dog. Then it
is the challenge. And it is something that you can do to help other
people,'' Dotson said.
   Members of the American team left Dulles International Airport
outside Washington at 3:30 am. EST aboard a heavily loaded American
Trans Air 727. It arrived about 19 hours later at Yerevan, said
State Department spokeswoman Christine Murray.
   ``This is a special opportunity for us to reach out and work with
the Soviet Union,'' said Julia Taft, head of the Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance of the State Department's Agency for
International Development.
   On a separate flight, 18 firefighters from Fairfax County, Va.,
and Miami left Saturday afternoon from Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington. The firefighters were part of a special cave-in
response team that was enlisted Friday night by the State
Department. In addition to the fire fighters approximately 15-tons
of heavy equipment, food and supplies were aboard the Air Force C-5A.
   A chartered Boeing 707 carrying a 95,000-pound load of mostly
medical supplies and pharmaceuticals left John F. Kennedy
International Airport at mid-afternoon Saturday, also bound for
Yerevan. The flight was sponsored by Americares, based in New
Canaan, Conn.
   ``The American Red Cross is today sending 10,000 blood bags to
help victims of the Armenian earthquake. ... We'll also be sending
antibiotics, syringes and other medical supplies that have been
requested by the Soviet Red Cross,'' a statement said.
   Richard F. Schubert, President of the American Red Cross, said
this marks the first time that shipments of emergency supplies have
been accepted by the Soviet Red Cross.
   ``The tremendous outpouring of aid ... clearly demonstrates that
humanity transcends political and geographic frontiers,'' he said.
   At Los Angeles International Airport, workers loaded an
Occidental Petroleum Boeing 727 corporate jet with 2,300 pounds of
medical supplies mostly donated by the Red Cross. The jet was also
bringing $1 million contributed by Occidental and World Vision, a
privately funded international Christian relief agency.
   Occidental is chaired by Armand Hammer, who has long had ties
with the Soviet Union.
   Also accompanying the flight is Dr. Rosa Maria Durezo, 38, an
anesthesiologist on the UCLA medical staff who helped organize
relief medical services and supplies to Mexico City after the
September 1985 earthquake there.
   ``Our experience from the Mexican earthquake is that once the
damage is done, and it's three or four days later, there's not much
that can be done'' by doctors,'' she said. She said medical
treatment is mostly post-trauma treatment of people who have
suffered crushing injuries, infection and shock.
   In Boston, Oxfam America announced a $20,000 grant to provide
temporary shelters and medical supplies for the earthquake victims.
The International Association of Fire Chiefs said it was assembling
a 10-member rescue team to fly to the stricken area.
   President-elect Bush, accompanied by his wife, Barbara, and Brent
Scowcroft, his designated White House national security adviser,
visited the Soviet Embassy and signed a book of condolences for
earthquake victims.
   ``With anguish in our hearts for all those in the Soviet Union
who lost their loved ones,'' Bush wrote in the book.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin expressed gratitude for the
outpouring of aid and sympathy, while Bush said there should be a
free flow of relief efforts to the stricken area.
   ``If something has to be changed to expedite help to the people,
it should be done,'' Bush said. ``I know of no barriers.''
   The relief team that departed early Saturday included nine
doctors. Among them was Dr. Robert Gale of Los Angeles, who helped
treat radiation victims at Chernobyl.
   ``I have experience with disasters, experience with Soviet
disasters,'' Gale said. He said the political complications in
Armenia were less pronounced than at Chernobyl, where Soviet
authorities were criticized for maintaining secrecy after the
nuclear accident which carried radiation to neighboring countries.
   The other team members included Dr. Henry Sieligson, an emergency
room physician from Dekalb General Hospital in Atlanta, and Steve
McConaughy of Brookeville, Md., a canine team trainer who traveled
with his wife, Carol, and their black Newfoundland dogs, Ebony and
Shasta.
   The delegation also included Louise Simone, executive vice
president of the Armenian General Benevolent Union based in Saddle
Brook, N.J., and two doctors affiliated with the charitable society,
Garo Tertzakian and Vartkes Najarian, both of Los Angeles.
   ``For us, this is a long-term prospect to rebuild Armenia,'' said
Mrs. Simone, of New York City.
   She said the 80,000 people reported dead and 700,000 homeless
comprised about one-quarter of the 3.3 million people in Soviet
Armenia. Her foundation is raising millions of dollars to send
medicine and other relief supplies there.
   The dogs traveled with the human passengers in the main cabin,
which was packed with blankets, tents, hard hats and leather gloves
to protect the hands of workers who will try to pull victims from
the rubble of fallen buildings.
   Final arrangements for the flight were made during a meeting at
the State Department late Friday between Mrs. Taft and Yevgeny
Kutovoi, the No. 2 official at the Soviet Embassy, who said medical
supplies were urgently needed.
   Kutovoi said the Soviet government had established special bank
accounts for gifts. One account is at the Dupont Circle Branch of
the Riggs National Bank, 1913 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20036. It was named the ``Earthquake Relief Fund,'' and its
number is 04-08-572-564.
   The Soviet Vnesheconbank in Moscow also has established a fund
for wire transfers, with the account number 70-000-412.
   The American Red Cross reported that money, antibiotics and kits
used to draw blood are being collected. The Soviet Embassy said it
was setting up a special telephone line to handle a deluge of calls
offering assistance.
   The American Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for
inquiries and offers of help. The number is 1-800-453-9000. The
public can make donations to local Red Cross chapters, designated
for Soviet Armenian Earthquake Relief, or through various Armenian
groups.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has recommended that the
United States spend $50 billion over the next two decades to
relocate two nuclear weapons material plants, build five new
production reactors and clean up environmental damage caused by bomb
production, the Washington Post reported in its Sunday's editions.
   Doug Elmets, the Energy Department spokesman, declined comment on
the story, but acknowledged that a classified report was being sent
to President Reagan to be taken to Capitol Hill on Thursday.
   The Post, quoting administration sources, said the Energy
Department recommends building four small reactors at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls instead of the
single unit the department proposed earlier this year. The
department also proposes a new, large reactor at the Savannah River
Plant in South Carolina.
   In the report, according to the paper, the department also
proposes closing a uranium foundry, the Feed Materials Production
Center, near Fernald, Ohio, and the Rocky Flats plutonium-processing
plant near Denver. It also recommends moving plutonium-related
activities out of the Pinellas Plant near Largo, Fla., and out of
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory east of San Francisco
because, one of the newspaper's sources said, ``there are too many
people there.''
   The classified report, described by the Post as a blueprint for
the future of the nuclear-weapons complex, is scheduled to be
forwarded to the Senate and House Armed Services committees next
week, according to the paper. It said the report may be held up for
several weeks because of a dispute between the Energy Department and
the Office of Management and Budget over high costs.

<TEXT>
   The deputy chairman of the Bank of Crete
was arrested Saturday, and the legal adviser of Premier Andreas
Papandreou resigned in the wake of a banking scandal that has rocked
the socialist government.
   The adviser, George Kassimatis, stepped down Saturday for
``reasons of sensitivity,'' semi-official Athens New Agency reported
without elaborating.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said in a statement that
the premier accepted Kassimatis' resignation.
   The scandal broke out in October when opposition parties accused
senior government officials of involvement in illegal deals
allegedly set up by a man who then ran the Bank of Crete.
   The scandal has led to the resignation of three ministers.
Papandreou also fired two junior ministers for criticizing the
government's handling of the affair.
   The bank's deputy chairman, Panayotis Vakalis, was arrested
Saturday as he left his suburban Athens home and was taken to
security police headquarters, said a police spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with Greek practice.
   Vakalis was detained after a magistrate investigating the case
issued a warrant for his arrest. An arraignment is set for Monday,
the spokesman said.
   The 46-year-old banker is accused of complicity in a $300 million
fraud, forgery and embezzlement case involving the Bank of Crete's
fugitive chairman.
   Last week, a plan to shore up the foundering Bank of Crete
collapsed when another private Greek banking institution refused to
take over its debts. Figures on the exact size of the debt have not
been made public.
   In order to calm depositors' fears, the Bank of Greece, the
country's central bank, has said it will cover up to $60 million of
the bank's operational costs.
   The Bank of Crete's former chairman, George Koskotas, fled Greece
Nov. 6 after he was indicted on five counts of fraud and
embezzlement.
   He was arrested near Boston last month and was jailed pending an
extradition hearing. He had fled to Brazil, then gone to Bermuda
before his arrest.
   Koskotas, who ran a family house-painting business in New York
from 1974 to 1979, is also charged with attempting to defraud the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service. A hearing is scheduled in Manhattan
Federal Court on Jan. 9.
   Koskotas acquired a controlling interest in the Bank of Crete in
1984, after working in its central Athens branch for two years as an
accountant. He is charged with using bank funds to build a
publishing empire and buy a controlling interest in a top Greek
soccer club.
   The scandal widened when a banking commissioner investigating the
Bank of Crete said public service organizations had more than $133
million on deposit with the bank.
   Greek newspapers and opposition political parties accused
officials working for the post office, telephone company and other
public services of receiving interest rates above the legal limit
from the bank and pocketing the difference.

   President Reagan is boasting of a ``clean bill

tissue taken from his colon before declaring the 77-year-old
president cancer-free.
   And Nancy Reagan was told her latest breast X-ray shows ``no
evidence of cancer of any kind.''
   The couple, both of whom have battled cancer while in the White
House, spent more than four hours Friday at Bethesda Naval Hospital
for annual physicals and cancer checkups.
   Departing the hospital for the a weekend at Camp David., the
president and his wife both smiled and gave ``thumbs-up'' signs.
Reagan sported a pair of blue running shoes for tests that required
him to walk a treadmill. He called out, ``clean bill of health'' to

   A nine-month surveillance spawned by a rash of
commuter airline accidents that killed 56 people uncovered
``systemic deficiencies'' in management and operation of many
commuter airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration says.
   The FAA said Friday that while its special examination of the
commuter industry found some carriers in full compliance with
federal regulations ``others demonstrated a need for significant
improvements.''
   The special inspections program, which began in March, covered 35
airlines, or about 20 percent of the commuter industry.
   The FAA said its inspections uncovered 1,284 violations of
air-safety regulations, about one-third of which were considered
serious enough to warrant a possible civil penalty.

says a thorough background check is delaying the naming of
President-elect Bush's defense secretary.
   Amid reports that an FBI check of top contender John Tower's
personal life is slowing down the process, supporters of the Texas
Republican said the delay could scar Tower politically.
   ``You always wish things could go faster,'' Sununu said Friday.
``And yet, in today's world, the worst thing you could do is to do
things quickly rather than thoroughly and that applies to all
appointments, not just the Tower one.''
   ``You don't get any extra credit for being early,'' the New
Hampshire governor said.

   Oliver L. North repeatedly lied to government
officials ``to cover his tracks'' when confronted with complaints
that Iran was overcharged for U.S. weapons during arms-for-hostage
deals, prosecutors say.
   ``North persisted in a pattern of deception that enabled him to
exploit the Iran initiative by secretly using it to generate a pool
of funds over which he exercised control without governmental
accountability,'' prosecutors said in a filing Friday.
   The former National Security Council aide initially lied to a
Defense Department officer and two CIA officials about the price
Iranian arms dealer Manuchar Ghorbanifar agreed on for 1,000 TOW
missiles in January 1986, the filing said.
   North made the ``critical misrepresentation'' during his report
of the London meeting _ at which Ghorbanifar agreed to pay $10
million, or $10,000 a missile.

   A man who calls himself ``Black Santa''
is quitting after 26 years of helping the needy despite pleas from
the mayor, the governor and others that he reconsider.
   Robert ``Say'' McIntosh, said he feels exhausted, unappreciated
and dismayed by the growing influence of drugs and a disappearing
work ethic among children and their parents.
   ``I'm just disgusted with the whole thing. I don't have the
cheerful mind to be Santa Claus this year,'' the 44-year-old
restaurateur said Friday.
   His announcement prompted pleas that he change his mind.
   ``It's really too bad,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton. ``Say has done a
lot for several years and I hope he'll be back soon.''
   The governor has been an object of both praise and protests from
McIntosh, known for his free feasts for the poor and leaflets
expounding on a range of subjects.
