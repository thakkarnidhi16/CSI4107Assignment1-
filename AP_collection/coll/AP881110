   The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has been forced to
suspend at least until January the processing of applications of
Soviet refugees, the State Department said Thursday.
   In a sense, the Reagan administration is a victim of its own
policy.
   Having insisted that the Soviet Union allow people to leave, the
embassy now finds that the flood of about 100 applications a day is
exceeding financial and quota limits.
   Most of the refugees are Armenians, although a few are Jews.
   In another category, the level of Jews allowed to leave for
Israel is now so high there may be a slowdown in processing those
who apply in Rome or Vienna to go to the United States instead, said
State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman.
   Redman called the Soviet response to U.S. emigration demands a
``welcome development.'' But, he said, it meant the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow processed six times as many refugees from the Soviet Union in
fiscal year 1988, which ended Sept. 30, as in the previous year.
   A total of 16,500 Soviet refugees and immigrants are permitted to
enter the United States each year _ 4,000 directly as refugees and
12,500 via Rome and Vienna.
   Among the refugees, Redman said, there is a backlog of 1,700
cases, causing U.S. immigration officials to halt further interviews
at least until January.
   ``In view of the situation,'' the spokesman said, ``the embassy
is urging applicants not to make an irrevocable commitment or to cut
their ties'' to the Soviet Union.
   At present, Redman said, 1,500 applicants have been cleared and
will leave for the United States once they obtain airline tickets.
   The second category of immigrants facing a squeeze are Jews who
go to Rome or Vienna with permits for Israel and then ask for
admission to the United States.
   There were 2,400 applications in October, the U.S. official said,
``and at this rate it may result in delays of processing, as well.''
   While most of the immigrants who exit through Rome and Vienna are
Jews, Redman said, a small percentage are not. But all of them have
exit permits as Jews for Israel.
   This year's quota is squeezed by a need to process some 1,500 who
were stranded last summer in Rome and Vienna by an upsurge in Soviet
permits.
   Last year, 20,421 immigrants reached the United States from the
Soviet Union, about 9,400 of them Jews.

<HEAD>Group Asks Banks To Prod Latin America To Forgo Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-nuclear group on Thursday urged three
major U.S. banks with large loans to Brazil and Argentina to use
their influence to dissuade those two nations from developing
nuclear weapons.
   ``In no area of the world is the issue of nuclear proliferation
more uncertain than in Latin America,'' said Jeremy J. Stone,
president of the Federation of American Scientists, a group of 5,000
scientists seeking to end the nuclear arms race.
   Stone said he made the plea in the form of a shareholders'
resolution that federation members who hold bank stock had submitted
to Citicorp, Bank of America and Manufacturers' Hanover. He said
those banks have loans totalling $10 billion to Brazil and Argentina.
   The resolution urged each bank ``to commend the two countries for
their declared policy of using nuclear power only for peaceful
purposes'' and ``to convey to suitable Brazilian and Argentine
officials its view that nuclear explosives, and a nuclear arms race,
in Latin America would complicate the bank's ability to sustain its
financial links to that region.''
   Neither Brazil nor Argentina is believed to have nuclear weapons.
But both are developing nuclear plants that when fully operational
could produce nuclear weapons material, according to a statement
released by the federation.
   Both nations have recently gone from military to civilian rule,
Argentina in 1983 and Brazil in 1985, a transition which in the view
of nuclear proliferation expert Leonard S. Spector has decreased
their inclination to develop nuclear weapons.
   Spector, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace in Washington, wrote in his 1987 book, ``Going Nuclear,'' that
Brazil and Argentina are the only nations in South America ``with
programs that might lead to the development of a nuclear deterrent.''
   ``Since the summer of 1987, the leaders of each country have
visited classified nuclear installations of the other, developments
which in this field are unprecedented confidence-building steps,''
Spector said in an interview.
   But the political climate could change, said Spector, and the
nuclear programs in the two countries ``are reaching a point where
dangerous ambiguities are going to arise, creating suspicions in
both countries that the other is moving to acquire nuclear weapons.''
   ``What we need to do is encourage positive political steps to
slow down the technological trends,'' he said.
   Argentinta and Brazil have refused to sign binding
non-proliferation pledges under the 1968 Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has been ratified by
over 130 governments.
   A spokesman for Manufacturers' Hanover Trust, John Meyers, said
bank had loans of $1.4 billion to Argentina and $2 billion to
Brazil. He said the bank had received the resolution and would
respond, but had no immediate public comment.
   Spokesmen for Citicorp and Bank of America could not immediately
be reached for comment.

   John N. Mitchell, former
attorney general who authorized the Watergate break-in and then went
to prison for conspiring to cover-up the burglary, died Wednesday of
a heart attack. He was 75.
   Mitchell, the first former attorney general to be convicted of a
crime, served a 19-month prison term for his role in the Watergate
cover-up. He was convicted along with President Richard Nixon's
chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and the president's domestic counselor,
John D. Ehrlichman, who also served 1{ years in prison.
   Mitchell, who was known for his credo that ``when the going gets
tough, the tough get going,'' was Nixon's closest adviser. He was
Nixon's law partner and mentor, then ran his 1968 and 1972 election
campaigns.
   Mitchell was indicted March 1, 1974, and was convicted of one
count of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, two counts false
statements to a grand jury and one count of perjury. He began a
2{-to-8-year term at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama on June 22,
1977.

<HEAD>Photographs by Author Auctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of photographs by 19th century
children's writer and mathematician Lewis Carroll, most of them of a
female child model, has fetched $55,780 at auction, Phillips
auctioneers said.
   Carroll, whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, was an
enthusiastic photographer who wrote the classic children's stories
``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ``Through the Looking
Glass.''
   Most of the 61 prints and 27 negatives sold Wednesday are of a
family friend, child model Alexandra Kitchin, between the ages of
five and 16. She was known as ``Xie'' by her family, and her
godmother was Queen Alexandra.
   One of the bidders was Xie's great-granddaughter, Deryn Cowdy, a
26-year-old artist who paid $268 for a photograph of Xie at the age
of 12 in July 1876.
   The collection, which had been expected to sell for about
$80,000, came on the market after a family disagreement over
ownership, said Miss Cowdyy.
   ``There was a huge family row about who they belonged to, so they
finally went to the family's solicitors (lawyers),'' she said.
``Because they couldn't agree, it was decided to sell them and
divide the money between Xie's 16 grandchildren. It's a bit sad,
really.''
   The Musee D'Orsay in Paris bought several photographs to add to
its existing collection of Carroll's photographs.

<DATELINE>WOODSTOCK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Claussen Co. announced Wednesday a
recall of certain jars of sauerkraut because pieces of glass were
found in eight containers in three states, officials said.
   Woodstock-based Claussen asked consumers to return all 32-ounce
jars of sauerkraut labled ``Use by Feb. 18, 89'' and ``Use by Feb.
19, 89'' to the stores where they were purchased, said company
spokesman James Aehl. Claussen produced 63,000 jars bearing the two
dates.
   Consumers in South Carolina, Georgia and Tucson, Ariz., found
glass in three jars over the weekend, he said. There were no reports
of injuries.
   ``We searched store supplies in those areas and discovered five
other jars that had glass in the sauerkraut,'' Aehl said. ``That's
when we decided to recall the product.''
   The size of the glass fragments ranged from slivers to
1{-inch-long pieces, he said.
   Company officials were trying to determine how the glass got into
the sauerkraut, he said, ``We believe it happened during ther
manufacturing of the product. There's no evidence of tampering. It
appears to be broken jars where a little glass got into the
product.''
   The company set up a toll-free telephone number for consumers to
call if they have questions. The number is 1-800-322-1421 and people
can call between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. EST.

<TEXT>
   Riot squads fired tear gas to disperse more
than 1,000 taxi drivers who blocked a central city square to protest
anti-pollution measures that restrict their movement.
   Two taxi drivers were arrested during the clashes Wednesday
outside parliament in Constitution square, a police official said.
   The cabbies blocked traffic with more than 500 taxis, and clashes
broke out when police started towing the parked yellow cabs.
   The city's 17,000 cabbies began a four-day strike Tuesday to
protest anti-pollution measures restricting taxi circulation on
weekdays in a five-square-mile zone around the city center. The
restrictions work according to odd and even license plate numbers.
   The cabbies claim 50 percent of their fares are generated in the
city center. The average taxi driver takes home about $400 a month.
   A brown colored smog, known to Athenians as the Nefos _ or cloud
_ forms over the city on warm, windless days. Cars, diesel-powered
taxis and the city's aging buses are blamed for most of the
pollution.

<HEAD>Co-Author of `Grease' Dies At 53</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warren Casey, a lyricist and author who helped
write the hit musical ``Grease,'' died after a 10-month battle with
AIDS. He was 53.
   Casey, who died Tuesday at St. Joseph's Hospital, had battled
acquired immune deficiency syndrome since February but continued
composing music, said his companion, Burt Cohen.
   Casey was best known as a collaborator with Jim Jacobs of Chicago
in ``Grease,'' a joyous look at high school in the 1950s. The
musical, which appeared on Broadway, later was the basis for a movie
of the same name.
   ``In many ways, `Grease' typified the energy and spirit of
Chicago theater way before what we now refer to as the Chicago
Theater Movement,'' said Dennis Zacek, artistic director of the
Victory Gardens Theater, which included Casey on its original
artistic board.
   A native of Yonkers, N.Y., Casey earned a degree in fine arts at
Syracuse University and later taught in New York high schools.
   He came to Chicago in the 1960s and met Jacobs while acting with
the Chicago Stage Guild.

<HEAD>Mayor Recalled By One Vote After Skunk Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FEDERAL HEIGHTS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 81-year-old mayor of this
Denver suburb has been recalled from office by a single vote in an
election in which his wife was not able to vote.
   Les Bauer, who had been mayor 13 years and lost Tuesday's
election 896-895, was blamed for cuts to a skunk-control program.
   The fuss started earlier this year when City Council voted to end
the suburb's skunk removal program in a cost-cutting effort.
Officials said it costs $87 per skunk to catch the animals and
remove them to Adams County, where they were delivered to a disposal
company.
   Bauer was blamed for cuts in the program, and although skunk
removal was restored, he was made the target of the recall.
   City Councilman Wayne Martin won the race to replace Bauer as
mayor. Martin was recalled from the council in 1983 and failed in
the last two elections to regain his seat.
   Bauer said his wife, Hazel, wasn't able to vote because she was
hospitalized.
   ``If she could have voted, it would have been tied and I would
have stayed in,'' Bauer said Wednesday.

   Hand-in-hand, President Reagan and his wife
walked down the little path that leads from the Oval Office to the
south drive to greet the next occupants of the White House. ``We'll
sign over the lease later,'' Reagan told reporters.
   The long black limousine bringing Vice President and Mrs. Bush
from Andrews Air Force Base stopped at the foot of the walk and the
first one out was Sen. Dan Quayle, the vice president-elect, who had
been riding in the jump seat.
   Often in American history, when outgoing and incoming president
meet at the White House, the atmosphere is strained and the words
stilted. But Reagan had gone all out to get his vice president
elected and on Wednesday, when they gathered for the first time
since the election, all was cheer.
   ``There he is,'' said Bush when he spotted the president. ``Thank
you so much.''
   Reagan, Bush, Quayle and their wives, Nancy, Barbara and Marilyn
shook hands all around and walked into the Oval Office for less than
five minutes of transition talk.
   ``Do you like the looks of the place?'' shouted a reporter.
``Beautiful day,'' said the vice president-elect. ``Look good to
you?''
   ``Beautiful day.''
   Later, speaking to a few hundred supporters in the Rose Garden,
with Reagan at his side, Bush said, ``I don't believe there's a case
in modern presidential politics of a president who's worked so hard
to help someone else achieve this office and I will always be
grateful.''
   And Reagan: ``If anyone wants to know how Nancy and I feel about
this moment, just read our smiles.'' He then mentioned that he
figures it's only 1,188 days until the Iowa caucus.
   In the mellowness of the moment, Reagan praised the Democrats who
ran against Bush and Quayle.
   ``I want to congratulate both of you, as well as Governor
(Michael) Dukakis and Senator (Lloyd) Bentsen, in taking on the
great challenge, and your sense of public duty in seeing it through
to the end.''
   ``Each of you is better for it, and so is the country,'' said
Reagan. As for the new administration: ``You ain't seen nothing
yet.''
   Quayle was the last to take the microphone. ``Thank you for all
you have done for America,'' he told Reagan.
   And to Bush: ``Yesterday, the American people overwhelmingly
placed their trust and their confidence in your leadership, and I'm
delighted to be part of that team and ready to go to work and change
America and make it even greater.''

   Michael Dukakis was back tending to Statehouse
duties a day after losing his bid for the White House, promising to
be Massachusetts' ``very best governor'' and warning that the
negative tone of this year's campaign set a dangerous precedent for
coming races.
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' Dukakis said Wednesday after spending
several hours catching up on state business. ``Almost doesn't count
in politics.''
   He said he felt no bitterness toward George Bush and was ready to
put the campaign behind him and complete the final two years of his
term as governor. Dukakis gave no indication whether he will run for
a fourth term in 1990 or seek the presidency again in four years.
   ``At this point my job is clear: I'm going to be the very best
governor of this commonwealth that I can be,'' Dukakis told
reporters. ``There's a lot to do. There are many challenges out
there ahead. What happens in the future remains to be seen.''
   Among those challenges will be re-establishing relations with his
state Legislature amid growing rumbling about the Dukakis
administration's handling of a revenue shortfall that has forced
Massachusetts to borrow to pay its bills.
   Although it is dominated by Democrats, the Legislature has
scheduled hearings next week to look into state finances, and
Dukakis could come under fire from lawmakers unhappy that the
governor was out of state for much of the past year as the problem
unfolded.
   At the same time Dukakis said he expected to remain a player in
national Democratic Party politics _ including having a say in the
selection of a new party chairman.
   Dukakis wasted no time getting back to work, arriving at the
office at 9:30 a.m. to applause from about 50 state workers. Later
in the day he met with reporters to reflect on the campaign, which
he said left President-elect Bush without a mandate and the
Democratic Party with lasting grass-roots and fund-raising
organizations despite his loss.
   ``I'm not a bitter person,'' a weary Dukakis said. ``I look
forward. I'm fundamentally an optimist and somebody who believes
deeply in this country and its people.
   ``Am I disappointed, sure I am,'' he said, laying at least part
of the blame for his loss on the tone of the Bush campaign.
   ``It was a distorted campaign,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
``It was a campaign that distorted my record and I think did not set
high standards for the kind of campaign we want for the presidency
and it may well set a standard we live to regret.''
   National Democratic leaders were unhappy with the insular
management of the Dukakis effort, yet Dukakis trumpeted himself as
someone who would keep a high profile within his party.
   ``I'll be in the thick of the fight to make sure that we respond
to the real concerns of the people of this coutnry,'' Dukakis said.
``I personally will continue to do whatever I can, with my fellow
governors, the Congress, with the new administration, here in
Massachusetts, to make sure that we respond and that we respond
strongly and well to those concerns and those challenges which face
the American people every day.''
   Dukakis also had a bit of advice for future candidates.
   ``I think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have to
respond and you have to respond quickly,'' said Dukakis, who largely
ignored unrelenting GOP attacks _ and advisers urging him to respond
_ until late in the campaign.
   But he had no substantive answer to the Democratic Party's
dilemma; while it has great success in local, state and
congressional races it has had only one successful presidential
candidate in the last 20 years.
   Dukakis also offered a few jokes before saying good-bye to the
large national press corps that traveled with him.
   ``I believe in the redemption of souls,'' he deadpanned when
asked about the appointment of James A. Baker III, who managed the
Bush campaign Dukakis so frequently criticized, as secretary of
state.
   He drew laughter again when asked why he didn't campaign
throughout the race as furiously as he did in the final three days,
when he stumped virtually non-stop without sleep.
   ``If I had more time, you'd all be in the hospital,'' he said
with a grin. ``I wouldn't have done that to you guys, I think too
much of you.''

   If George Bush wants advice from former
presidents, he is likely to have more of them to call upon than any
president since Abraham Lincoln.
   For the first time since Martin Van Buren died on July 24, 1862,
there are expected to be four living ex-presidents after
Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
   This, of course, assumes that President Reagan and the three
former presidents now living - Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter - survive to see Bush sworn in.
   All of them are believed to be in good health. Reagan is the
oldest, at 77. Nixon and Ford are 75 and Carter, 64.
   There have only been four times in American history when as many
as four former presidents were living - during the administrations
of John Quincy Adams, James Knox Polk, James Buchanan and Lincoln.
   Actually, when Lincoln moved into the White House in March of
1861, there were five of his predecessors still around. In addition
to Buchanan, whom he succeeded, they were Van Buren, John Tyler,
Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce.
   Tyler died in January 1862, and Van Buren died six months later.
   Five times in history there have been no former presidents alive,
most recently for the last year and a half of the Nixon
administration, after Lyndon B. Johnson died in January 1973.
   George Washington of course could not call on one of his
predecessors for advice, because he didn't have any. As for his
successor, John Adams, Washington died in December 1979, midway
through the Adams administration.
   Adams and his three successors, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison
and James Monroe, all survived into the administration of Adams'
son, John Quincy Adams.
   The elder Adams was the longest lived of American presidents,
dying at 91.
   The younger Adams, Andrew Jackson, Van Buren and Tyler all lived
into the Polk administration of the 1840s.
   Polk died at 53, shortly after leaving office, but Van Buren,
Tyler, Fillmore and Pierce all lived into and through Buchanan's
term as president.
   Fillmore and Pierce, along with Andrew Johnson, were living when
Ulysses S. Grant took office in 1869, but all had died by the time
Grant left the White House in 1877.
   The next time the nation was left without a living ex-president
was during the last two months of the Herbert Hoover administration,
following the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933.
   Hoover was the only living president throughout the White House
tenure of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.
   Both Truman and President Dwight Eisenhower named Hoover to head
commissions to reorganize the executive branch of government.
   Reagan has met privately with Nixon several times during his
administration.

   Vice president-elect Dan Quayle is getting
ready to settle into his new job in January, while his wife
apparently is mulling what to do if offered her husband's vacant
Senate seat.
   As Sen. Quayle, R-Ind., headed toward his transition headquarters
near the White House Wednesday, Mrs. Quayle was asked by reporters
if she was interested in succeeding her husband.
   ``You'll have to ask the governor,'' she replied. ``That's an
answer I'll give him. You'll be the second to know.''
   Quayle has refused to say when he would officially notify Indiana
Gov. Robert Orr of his resignation from the Senate.
   He has signaled several times in recent days that he would submit
his resignation before Orr's term ends in January so that the
Republican governor, rather than Democratic Gov.-elect Evan Bayh,
can appoint someone to fill the Senate seat.
   Quayle also said he had no specific timetable for making staff
appointments and said his tour of the four-story, white-brick
townhouse off Lafayette Park was aimed at ``assembling thoughts,
conversing with people, nothing specific.''
   ``When we have specific things, believe me, you'll be the first
to know,'' the senator said, a day after he and Vice President
George Bush scored a lopsided electoral triumph over Democrats
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   Quayle had no public events on his schedule today, and aides said
he would continue to make telephone calls and contacts as he works
on the transition.
   There has been widespread speculation that Marilyn Quayle, a
licensed lawyer in addition to being a housewife, is among those
under consideration to take her husband's Senate seat. Among other
names mentioned in Indiana Republican political circles are Rep. Dan
Coats and Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut, and possibly Lt. Gov.
John Mutz, who lost to Bayh on Tuesday.
   The Quayles have sought to minimize speculation that Mrs. Quayle
is interested in succeeding her husband.
   The couple have three children _ Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 12 and
Corinne, 9 _ and it is believed that one obstacle to Mrs. Quayle's
taking on a Senate seat is their concern about both parents being
involved in extremely demanding jobs.
   On Wednesday afternoon, Quayle rode out to Andrews Air Force Base
in suburban Maryland to greet Bush on the vice president's return
from Texas.
   Bush praised Quayle, saying ``he's going to be one of the great
vice presidents. You watch him closely.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, and Quayle and his wife drove to the
White House, where they exchanged tributes with President Reagan.
   ``As one who came to the Senate in 1980, thank you for all you
have done for America,'' Quayle said. `` ... The American people
overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your
leadership, and I'm delighted to be a part of that team and am ready
to go to work and change America and make it even greater.''

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush, vowing to
revitalize government with ``a brand new team of people,'' has
instructed key figures from his campaign to develop priorities for
the crucial first 100 days of his coming administration.
   Even before Bush won the presidency, job applications were
pouring into his standby transition office. The stream of resumes is
expected to turn into a flood now at newly opened Bush transition
headquarters.
   Just hours after claiming victory, Bush took the first steps
Wednesday toward assembling his presidency.
   The president-elect, at a news conference in his adopted home of
Houston before flying back to Washington, named James A. Baker III,
his campaign chairman and longtime trusted adviser, to be secretary
of state. It could be the most important post in a Bush presidency,
given the vice president's emphasis on foreign affairs and his
interest in pursuing progress with Moscow.
   Baker, while preparing for his diplomatic duties, also will play
a major role in the transfer of power to Bush from Ronald Reagan.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's vice presidential chief of staff, and
campaign pollster Robert Teeter will share authority as co-chairmen
of the transition team.
   Mindful that the first months of an administration set the tone
for relations with Congress and foreign governments, Bush said, ``I
will have a game plan.''
   ``Part of what the transition is about is to spell out the
priorities. I spelled them out (during the campaign) in broad terms,
in terms of keeping the economic expansion going and in terms of
world peace. But the election ended yesterday,'' Bush said.
   ``We will now have (73) days ... to formulate a game plan, the
first 100 day priorities, if you will, and they'll be specific.''
   In an announcement sure to send shivers through the ranks of the
5,000 political appointees happily at work in the Reagan
administration, Bush said, ``I will for the most part bring in a
brand new team of people from across the country.''
   ``And in my view that will reinvigorate the process,'' Bush said.
   He deliberately left room for some Reagan holdovers and veterans
to join his administration. ``There will be ... a major turnover but
some people at various levels may be asked to remain.''
   On the flight back to Washington, Bush said he wanted to announce
the rest of his Cabinet ``sooner rather than way late'' and would
think about the possible choices during a Florida vacation this
weekend.
   It has been widely assumed Bush will ask Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos to stay on. All three joined the Reagan
administration in recent months.
   Thornburgh said Wednesday he had been given no indication of
whether Bush wanted him to remain ``nor have I sought'' any
information on the question. The Washington Post reported Bush
wanted to replace Thornburgh with former Environmental Protection
Agency chief and deputy attorney general William Ruckelshaus or
Illinois Gov. James Thompson. Thompson said Wednesday he wasn't
interested.
   Former Sen. John Tower of Texas, an arms negotiator in the Reagan
administration who later advised Bush's campaign on national
security matters, may be in line for secretary of Defense.
   Ann Dore McLaughlin may keep her post as Labor secretary or get
another Cabinet position, possibly Interior, where she was
undersecretary from 1984 to 1987.
   Others mentioned as possible nominees for the Labor post include
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., and Constance Horner, now director of the
Office of Personnel Management.
   Former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, wife of one-time
Bush rival Bob Dole, also is mentioned as a candidate for another
Cabinet job.
   For the powerful post of budget chief, the odds on favorite is
Richard Darman, a one-time senior aide in the Reagan White House and
later deputy secretary of Treasury.
   Darman's name also has been mentioned as the new White House
chief of staff, although Fuller and New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu
are more frequently discussed for that job. Sununu also is a
candidate to be secretary of Energy.
   Richard Burt, ambassador to West Germany, is known to be
interested in the job of national security adviser at the White
House. Brent Scowcroft, who served in that role for President Ford,
is mentioned for it again.
   Over the next 2{ months, power will begin to shift from Reagan to
Bush as the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments look to the
incoming president for a signal of his intentions.
   However, Bush said, ``President Reagan is still the president of
the United States and I will not be using the transition to try to
make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the
president's.''
   Policy matters aside, Bush indicated his management style will be
different from Reagan. For example, he said he will be briefed
directly every day by the CIA on intelligence matters instead of
relying on the White House national security adviser for an update,
as Reagan had.
   Bush also announced that Boyden Gray, his legal adviser in the
vice president's office, will serve the same role in the transition
and then go on to the White House as his general counsel.
   Chase Untermeyer, former assistant secretary of the Navy who has
been a one-man transition planner for Bush, will be the transition's
chief personnel headhunter and keep the same job in the White House
come Jan. 20.
   Sheila Tate, who has been the campaign secretary, will be press
secretary during the transition. Bush did not mention whether she
would have that title in the White House, and some GOP sources close
to the campaign indicate someone else may get the job.
   Altogether, there are 5,000 political appointments, divided
between presidential appointments and those made by Cabinet
secretaries and agency heads.
   Many of the 3,000 or so presidential appointments do not really
draw the attention of the chief executive and are handled by others.
``It's in the hundreds rather than the thousands that really
matter,'' Untermeyer said.

<HEAD>Malfunctions Delay Occupancy Of $23 Million CDC Containment Lab</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Malfunctions in a ventilation system designed to
contain deadly microbes will delay occupancy of a $23 million
research building at the Centers for Disease Control until at least
next year, officials said Wednesday.
   The new maximum-containment laboratory, for which a
ribbon-cutting ceremony was held last month, is part of CDC's shift
from investigating outbreaks of disease to basic research into
infectious disease.
   An estimated 80 researchers had planned to move into the building
this fall, but the move will be delayed until problems are worked
out in the complex ventilation system.
   ``They want to be sure before they clear a system like that for
people like me to crawl under a hood and begin working with a hot
virus,'' said Dr. Thomas Fowlkes, director of the CDC's retrovirus
laboratory.
   The system is designed to keep air pressure inside the building's
12 laboratories slightly below normal atmospheric pressure so that
air from the hallways always flows into the labs. The intentional
draft is supposed to keep microbes such as viruses from being
carried out of the labs.
   Viruses that will be studied at the labs include those that cause
AIDS and Lassa Fever, which has caused epidemics of hemorrhagic
fever in Nigeria.
   Steve White, the CDC engineer responsible for operating the air
system, said Wednesday that the problems lie somewhere in the 96
pneumatic control units whose delicate sensors and valves measure
and adjust air pressure throughout the building.
   For unknown reasons, changes in air pressure, such as those
caused by an open door, throw the gauges out of adjustment.
   The building originally was scheduled for completion in late 1987.

   The latest showing of the Humphrey Bogart
movie classic ``Casablanca'' is not in black and white, and the
Directors Guild of America is red all over.
   The Hollywood industry group said Wednesday night's showing of a
color-enhanced version of ``Casablanca'' on cable television's
SuperStation TBS represented ``a new low point in the battle to
degrade an American art form.'' The 1941 classic, which also starred
Ingrid Bergman, was filmed in black and white.
   ``In total disregard for the place `Casablanca' holds in
America's cultural heritage, TBS has gone ahead with a computerized
assault on one of history's greatest and most-beloved motion
pictures,'' Glenn Gumpel, the DGA's executive director, said in a
statement.
   ``For those who choose to watch the broadcast, we would simply
remind them that what they are seeing is not `Casablanca,' but a
computerized parody of an original and classic work,'' he said.
   In the past, TBS' owner, Ted Turner, who also owns MGM's film
library, has experienced similar criticism but healthy ratings for
its colorized versions of old movie classics. Turner has responded
to such criticism in the past by saying, ``I own it, I'll do what I
want with it.''

   Senate Democrats, assured of improving their
majority control by at least one seat, are signaling President-elect
George Bush that they want to avoid partisan warfare with the
Republican White House when the 101st Congress convenes in January.
   The final margin of the Democratic grip on the Senate from
Tuesday's elections will not be clear until a cliffhanger race in
Florida is resolved.
   The margin of victory for either Republican Rep. Connie Mack III
or Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay will not be known until state
election officials complete the formidable task of counting the
estimated 100,000 absentee ballots, the last to be tallied of the
four million votes cast.
   The vote counting was not expected to be complete until sometime
today at the earliest.
   MacKay held a slim lead before the absentee ballots were put on
the counting tables, but after the first results became known, Mack
had erased MacKay's advantage and had built a small lead of his own.
   A victory by Mack would leave Democrats with 55 of the 100 Senate
seats, up one from the 54-46 majority they held during the 100th
Congress. A MacKay victory would hand the Democrats a 56-44 edge.
   In Tuesday's balloting in 33 Senate races, Republicans lost seats
in Connecticut, Nebraska, Nevada and Virginia; Democratic seats were
captured by Republican candidates in Mississippi and Montana.
   Even if Democrats were to lose in Florida, they still would have
the majority. That carries with it the chairmanship of all Senate
committees and the right to set the chamber's agenda.
   Some lawmakers indicated that does not necessarily mean trouble
ahead for Republican President-elect George Bush.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said he and other chairmen ``are prepared to work with
President Bush and do that straight up, no holds barred, and find
whether he means what he says when he says that he expects to have a
close relationship with the Senate and the House.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said late Tuesday night that he
believes Bush will find a cooperative spirit on Capitol Hill because
``the problems are too important for Congress not to work with the
president.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., predicted budget issues will dominate
the attention of the Senate and House next year. The new president's
oft-repeated opposition to higher taxes ``will be the big sticking
point'' in his dealings with Congress, Domenici added.
   While most of the Senate races were won by decisive margins, one
was so close that the outcome may be challenged.
   In Wyoming, Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop won a third term by a
razor-thin edge over Democratic challenger John Vinich with
unofficial returns giving the incumbent a 1,310-vote edge over the
Democrat.
   But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Commmittee charged
irregularities in the handling of absentee ballots.
   Secretary of State Kathy Karpan said that after reviewing the
campaign committee's allegations with 23 county clerk's offices, she
had no reason to call for a recount in the contest.
   Karpan said state law requires a recount if the difference
between the two candidates' votes is less than 1 percent of those
cast for the winner. In the case of the Senate race, the difference
would have to have been less than 911 votes.
   However, a candidate may request a recount if he agrees to pay
for it. Recounting the votes would cost a maximum of $11,500, Karpan
said.
   Vinich, a state senator, said Wednesday his campaign was still
considering whether to ask for a recount.
   In Connecticut, liberal Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker, who
served 18 years, conceded Wednesday night after losing by just over
10,000 votes to Democrat Joseph Lieberman, the state attorney
general.
   Weicker, in a news conference in Greenwich Town Hall, shouldered
the responsibility for his defeat and ruled out any future in
politics.
   ``I'm a big guy. I take care of myself. I take shots, I've given
shots,'' he said. ``I'm responsible for last night's results.
   ``I didn't lose this race by a few thousand votes,'' the former
senator said. ``In my mind and in my heart, I lost it by 100,000.
... This wasn't a close race. It was a clear mandate by the state of
Connecticut, that matters that I stood for are not to their liking,
and that matters that Mr. Lieberman stood for are to their liking.''
   While 10 new senators were elected Tuesday, there will be 11 new
faces when the Senate convenes in January. Republican vice
president-elect Dan Quayle has indicated that he would step down
before January so Indiana's GOP Gov. Robert Orr _ not the incoming
governor, Democrat Evan Bayh _ can appoint a successor.

   The Justice Department's civil rights chief is
leaving government next month, after a seven-year tenure marked by
support from conservatives and condemnation from civil rights groups
for his attacks on affirmative action.
   William Bradford Reynolds, assistant attorney general in charge
of the civil rights division, said Wednesday he is resigning
effective Dec. 9.
   Reynolds said he probably will remain in the Washington area to
practice law and is discussing job possibilities with private firms.
   In an interview, Reynolds said he felt the Reagan
administration's greatest achievement in the civil rights field has
been ``restoring the principle of non-discrimination to its rightful
pedestal.''
   He said his greatest disappointment was getting word of ``our
extraordinary record out to the public in the way I would have
wanted.''
   Reynolds spearheaded the Reagan administration's opposition to
affirmative action hiring and promotion programs and other
anti-discrimination tools that had been at the heart of federal
civil rights policies since the 1960s.
   Liberals expressed pleasure over his resignation while
conservatives praised his record.
   ``If Brad Reynolds' departure is an indication of what the Bush
Justice Department will look like, then this is a hopeful sign
indeed,'' said Arthur Kropp, president of People for the American
Way, a civil liberties organization with 270,000 members. ``Reynolds
... will be missed by civil rights advocates about as much as
environmentalists miss (former Interior Secretary) James Watt.''
   Terry Eastland, a former Justice Department spokesman under
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and now a resident scholar
of the National Legal Center for the Public Interest, called
Reynolds ``a man dedicated to colorblind law.''
   ``He deserves great credit for making often courageous attempts
to advance that cause,'' Eastland said.
   ``In areas ranging from forced school busing to employment
discrimination to voting rights, Brad Reynolds has had a greater
impact upon the law in this area than anyone since Lyndon Johnson,''
said Patrick Korten, another former Meese Justice Department
spokesman who is now with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
Washington think tank.

   An investigation board determined
that inadequate procedures and poor design were mainly to blame for
a flash fire that did minor damage to the Magellan Venus space probe.
   The fire occurred Oct. 17 in a checkout hangar here when a
technician inadvertently hooked up an electrical connector with the
wrong jack, creating a short circuit that triggered a two- to
three-inch flame from a test battery on the spacecraft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimated the
small blaze did $87,000 damage to the battery, electrical wiring and
an insulation blanket. Officials said the accident would have no
impact of Magellan's April launch toward Venus from the space
shuttle Atlantis.
   In its final report released Wednesday, the board did not blame
the technician, saying he had to work ``in the blind'' in a confined
area while making the connection because of the spacecraft's design.
   The board recommended that procedures for hooking up the battery
connector be revised to permit easier access and greater visibility,
said Jon R. Busse, who headed the investigation.
   The board also said that before the accident it was believed the
connector could not cause a short if it made contact with the wrong
jack, but subsequent testing showed electrical contact can be made
on at least 10 of the 37 pins in the connector. It recommended that
NASA issue an alert of this possibility.
   Martin Marietta, which made the spacecraft, said in a statement
that it is making design and procedural changes recommended by the
board.

<HEAD>GAO: Nuclear Regulatory Problems Raise Public's Exposure Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
``continuing and sometimes chronic problems'' with its procedures
for licensing people to handle radioactive materials, the
investigative arm of Congress said in a report.
   The General Accounting Office report said the NRC usually does
not verify license application information, visit the nuclear
facility before granting a license or have specific criteria for
determining when to reject a license application.
   It said that as a result, ``NRC is overly vulnerable to dishonest
or careless applicants.''
   ``All of these weaknesses or problems increase the public's risk
of exposure,'' said the report issued Wednesday.
   Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, had asked for the GAO investigation
after a September 1986 accidental spill of radioactive material that
had been smuggled onto Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton,
Ohio.
   Feighan issued a statement calling on the NRC to ``take immediate
action to correct deficiencies identified in the report.''
   ``We have every right to expect quick response from an agency
that oversees hazardous materials licensing. Unfortunately, there is
little in the GAO report to suggest that the NRC has corrected
critical problems identified over the last 16 years,'' Feighan said.
   NRC spokesman John Kopack said the agency would not discuss the
report until after the agency's staff had reviewed it.
   The report noted that the NRC has limited resources: 25 full-time
license reviewers and 36 inspectors, versus 7,700 licenses for
industrial and other uses of radioactive materials.
   In addition to granting licenses without verifying applicants'
claims or visiting facilities, the report said the NRC:
   _Doesn't have checklists to determine when a license application
should be denied or when repeat violators should get extra penalties.
   _Doesn't make sure licence-holders can afford to clean up after
an accident.
   _Takes too long to renew licenses and make inspections because of
large backlogs.
   In the case that led to the GAO inquiry, the NRC gave a
radioactive materials-handling license to a 10th-grade dropout
without checking his claims about training and experience.
   The agency learned J.C. Haynes of Newark, Ohio, had provided
false information on his application only after it issued the
license, which enabled Haynes to use radioactive material to change
the color of diamonds.
   ``Despite this finding Haynes was not only allowed to keep the
license but it was amended to permit him to use larger quantities of
americium in any form,'' the report said.
   Americium, a hazardous byproduct of nuclear reactors, turns
diamonds green and makes lesser-quality stones more saleable. Its
radiation is 1,000 times more potent than a typical hospital
diagnostic procedure.
   Haynes illegally disposed of some of his radioactive waste at a
high-security munitions area of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
   Two accidental discharges there in 1986 forced the Air Force to
tear down a storage building and invest $1 million to decontaminate
the area. The Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund paid out
$385,000 to clean up Haynes' contaminated home.
   In another case reviewed in the report, the NRC conducted no
inspections between 1979 and 1986 at Ohio's Case Western Reserve
University, which was licensed to conduct research on a number of
radioactive materials.
   The 1986 inspection discovered coffee cups and food in the
laboratories, too close to radiation sources _ a problem the
university had agreed to correct in 1975. Last year, the university
was fined $10,000 and its license was suspended after the NRC
identified 21 license violations, including the storage of food in
restricted areas.

<HEAD>Fifty Years After Pogrom, East Berlin Jewish Landmarks Still In
Ruins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Germans commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
Nazi pogrom called Kristallnacht, one of Europe's largest Jewish
cemeteries is in ruins and one of its most magnificent synagogues
remains a bombed-out hulk.
   Both sites are in East Berlin and have been focal points of
observances of the Nov. 9-10, 1938, attacks by Nazi thugs on Jews,
their businesses and synagogues that launched the Holocaust.
   In the 108-year-old Jewish cemetery, the graves of once-prominent
Berlin intellectuals, artists, scientists and businessmen are
overgrown by trees and shrubs. Visitors must weave through dense
underbrush to view gravestones toppling after decades of neglect.
   The once-ornate synagogue, built in 1866, escaped destruction
during Kristallnacht, which means `Night of Broken Glass' in German.
Witnesses say a police officer prevented Nazi brownshirts from
starting enough fires to destroy the building, then called a fire
brigade that put out the blaze.
   But the synagogue was heavily damaged during Allied bombing raids
in 1943, and only its colored, oriental brick facade and turret
remain.
   Both landmarks are remants of the city's rich Jewish history, and
East Germany's communist authorities say they intend to aid efforts
by East Berlin's tiny Jewish community to restore the cemetery in
the city's once-affluent Weissensee section.
   An international trust has been set up with the consent of the
government to help finance restoration of the synagogue, a task
Jewish community spokeswoman Irene Runge says will take at least
five years.
   Before the Holocaust, 170,000 Jews lived in Berlin alone. Now, an
estimated 450-600 practicing Jews live in all of East Germany, about
half of them in the communist half of the divided city. They have no
permament rabbi.
   So far, much of the restoration work on the cemetery has been
done by the small and financially strapped Jewish community, with
the help of student and church groups.
   ``There just aren't enough resources to repair it and to keep it
up,'' said one cemetery worker.
   Among the 115,000 Jews buried there are some of the most
influential people in Berlin society until the beginning of Nazi
rule in 1933.
   A special section contains the remains of 365 Jews who died
fighting for Germany in World War I.
   Another section, erected after Germany's defeat in 1945, contains
the graves of scores who died in Nazi death camps.
   Historical accounts say Jews often thronged to the cemetery to
walk for a few undisturbed hours after Nazi laws banned them from
many areas of the city.
   The cemetery was closed in 1943, and afterwards its grounds were
used on occasion by Jews in hiding, historical records indicate.
   During this week's events marking the anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the East German government has emphasized the role of
the communists in fighting fascism and anti-Semitism.
   But it has reiterated its longstanding rejection of any
responsibility for the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of 6
million Jews, because East Germany was founded after the war.
   West Germany, also created from the ruins of Nazi Germany, has
paid more than 80 billion marks ($45 billion at today's rates) to
Holocaust victims and their families. East Germany has not paid any
reparations.
   Many members of East Berlin's Jewish community are skeptical
about the motives behind communist authorities' newly expressed
willingness to help them.
   ``What good does this all do me if I still have to ask a German
in uniform for permission to visit my sick brother in West Berlin,''
said one elderly Jewish resident.
   The East German government in 1961 erected a wall that divides
the city into communist and Western-controlled sectors.

<TEXT>
   A productive summit meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a resumption of U.S. aid to
Contra rebels in Nicaragua have high priority with President-elect
George Bush as he prepares to move into the White House.
   At a Houston news conference Wednesday in which he named James A.
Baker III as his choice for secretary of state, Bush provided more
of an insight into his foreign policy views than he had throughout
the election campaign.
   Bush ruled out a meeting with Gorbachev just to get to know the
Soviet leader. ``I am acquainted with him,'' Bush said. ``What I
want to see is progress. I've never supported meetings just for the
sake of having meetings.''
   But he defined progress in a way that was far short of a demand
that a summit produce cosmic results. Bush said there were a number
of areas _ arms control, human rights, regional disputes _ in which
the superpowers could make headway.
   By offering a range of categories, the president-elect took a
positive but cautious stance on summitry with Gorbachev. He said,
for instance, that a summit would not have to produce a treaty to
cut long-range nuclear weapons.
   President Reagan, on the other hand, entered the White House in
January 1981 extremely reluctant to hold a summit. But after
Gorbachev took over in 1985 the two leaders met annually _ four
times, in all.
   Bush said that before he would meet with Gorbachev he would have
Baker confer with the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and then with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   ``But I don't think that will start before I become president,''
he said.
   Asked about the Contras, whose surreptitious receipt of millions
of dollars from U.S. secret arms sales to Iran rocked the Reagan
administration, Bush explicitly supported a resumption of aid.
   Congress cut off all military assistance last February.
Humanitarian aid, in the form of food, clothing and shelter, is due
to expire in March.
   But Bush said aid to the rebels, who are at war with the
government in Nicaragua, ``will have a high priority because freedom
and democracy in this hemisphere have a high priority.''
   He said he intended ``to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas.''
   In a third area, Bush said he believed the Soviets would adhere
to their commitment to complete the withdrawal of their military
forces from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   If the Soviets do not pull out, Bush said, ``that will throw a
complicating factor over the whole relationship.''
   In responding to reporters' questions, the president-elect
neither condemned the Soviet Union on any issue nor lobbed any tough
rhetoric at Moscow. His overall tone on foreign policy was measured.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, meanwhile, hailed Baker's
selection as a ``welcome and heartening event.''
   In a news conference here, Shultz said Bush had telephoned him
before announcing the selection. ``He will hit the ground running,''
Shultz said of Baker, a Cabinet colleague and partner at
international economic summit meetings.
   ``His close, warm and productive relationship with
president-elect Bush makes him just the guy to serve as the
president's chief foreign policy adviser, and as chief spokesman for
the president and for our nation's interests,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz and Baker both are considered moderate to conservative in
their political views and are internationally minded. Together, they
tried without much success to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.

<HEAD>Forecast For 1988 Corn Harvest Revised Slightly Upward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's drought-reduced corn harvest is
expected to total 4.67 billion bushels, 3 percent above last month's
forecast but down 34 percent from the actual 1987 harvest, according
to the Agriculture Department.
   It represented the smallest harvest since 1983, when similar
searing heat and lack of rain shriveled output to 4.17 billion
bushels. The record was 8.88 billion bushels in 1985.
   The assessment Wednesday by USDA's Agricultural Statistics Board,
based on Nov. 1 estimates, came as farmers were trying to get the
last of this year's corn harvest out of the fields.
   By the start of the month, farmers had harvested an estimated 83
percent of this fall's corn acreage, 7 percent behind last year but
still 16 percent ahead of the 1983-87 average, the report said.
   The report reflected the summer drought in forecasting an average
corn yield per acre of 83.2 bushels, down 37.1 bushels from last
year but 2.1 bushels above the level contained in last month's
forecast.
   Farmers cut back this year to a little over 56.7 million acres
for corn from 59.1 million in 1987. One reason was government
programs designed to take acreage out of production and thus prevent
surpluses that drive down crop prices.
   The Agriculture Department is forecasting an adequate supply of
corn next year despite the drought, largely because of an abundant
existing stockpile.
   USDA economists say the drought is likely to add 1 percent to the
consumer price index for food this year and 2 percent next year as
the impact of the reduced crop is passed through to the market.
   The report said the ``all crops'' index of production as of Nov.
1 averaged 87 percent of the base year of 1977, down dramatically
from 106 percent at the same time last year and the lowest level in
10 years.
   The record high for the index was 117 percent in 1981, 1982 and
1985. It dropped to 88 percent in 1983, when drought and government
acreage cutbacks lowered production. It rose to 111 the following
year.
   The report forecast soybean production at 1.51 billion bushels,
up 1 percent from last month's forecast but 21 percent below last
year's harvest of 1.92 billion bushels. The record was 2.26 billion
bushels in 1979.
   The cotton harvest was estimated at 14.8 million bales, 1 percent
above both the 1987 crop and the Oct. 1 forecast. The record was
18.95 million bales in 1937.
   With the harvest of 1988 crops winding down, no new production
figures were included for many earlier commodities, such as wheat,
oats and barley.
   Other crops in the November production report included:
   _Sorghum, 546.3 million bushels and 60.6 bushels per acre
compared to 740.8 million and 69.9 bushels per acre last year.
   _Rice, 158.4 million hundredweight and 5,547 pounds per acre
compared to 127.7 million and 5,482 pounds last year.
   _Peanuts, 4.12 billion pounds and 2,507 pounds per acre compared
to 3.62 billion pounds and 2,341 pounds per acre last year.
   _Tobacco, 1.33 billion pounds and 2,114 pounds per acre compared
to 1.19 billion pounds and 2,028 pounds per acre last year.

   Soviet corn imports are expected to increase by
3 million tons this year because of limited supplies of feed wheat
on the world market and high barley prices, the Agriculture
Department says.
   The department said Wednesday the United States again is expected
to be a major supplier followed by Argentina and China.
   Overall, Soviet net grain imports should be up 2 million tons,
the department said. That estimate reflected not only an increase in
purchases of coarse grains but a drop in expected Soviet wheat
imports.
   A reduced coarse grain crop in 1988 and fairly attractive world
prices have resulted in heavy Soviet corn purchases in the current
marketing year.
   The department said coarse grain purchases to date total around 8
million tons with the bulk of the sales calling for delivery before
the end of December.
   In part because the Soviets are pushing hard to increase
livestock production, the department has increased its estimate of
Soviet coarse grain imports in the marketing year that started in
July to 17 million tons. The estimate for wheat imports was set at
13 million tons.

<HEAD>Official Says Restart Of Savannah Nuclear Reactor May Be Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety concerns at the Savannah River nuclear
plant may postpone the scheduled December restart of a reactor and
further delay fresh supplies of critical nuclear weapons materials,
says a senior Energy Department official.
   ``My own view is that we have been making insufficient progress
at the site to meet such a (December) date,'' said Richard W.
Starostecki, acting assistant energy secretary for environment,
safety and health.
   He also said needed improvement in equipment and operating
procedures throughout the nuclear weapons production complex near
Aiken, S.C., would take years to implement.
   In the past few months, nuclear weapons production has ground to
a virtual halt following shutdown of the three reactors at Savannah
River, the closure of a building at the Rocky Flats Plant near
Denver and a strike which has shut down the Feed Materials
Production Center in Fernald, near Cincinnati, Ohio.
   The Savannah River reactors are the only facilities in the United
States now capable of producing plutonium and tritium, which are
needed to make nuclear weapons. Plutonium supplies are plentiful,
but the tritium shortage will cause problems sometime in the next
six to 24 months, according to congressional and administration
sources.
   Starostecki compared the state of the federal nuclear weapons
complex to that of the commerical nuclear power industry after the
accident at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., on
March 28, 1979.
   He said it would take years to install safer equipment and raise
training standards to levels commensurate with those found in
private industry.
   ``These are programs that will take years to develop,''
Starostecki said in an inteview Tuesday. He envisioned widescale
introduction of robotics and remote handling devices to protect the
health of workers, but was unable to estimate the cost of such
systemwide improvements.
   To outline restart plans and get a firmer grip on a timetable for
Savannah River, Starostecki said, he was meeting this week with
managers from the department's office in Aiken and from E.I. DuPont
Nemours Co., the current contract operator, and Westinghouse Corp.,
which is to take over the plant next April 1.
   ``I am not focusing on the date,'' said Starostecki. ``My goal
this week is to get the people at the contract level, the DuPont
people, the Westinghouse people, along with DOE managers, to review
the status of the detailed technical acceptance criteria we are
going to be expecting those reactors to meet.
   ``The date will come out as a natural part of the dialogue,'' he
said.
   Last month, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said he hoped to
begin a phased start-up of the plant's L-reactor in December,
reaching 50 percent capacity over about a month. Each of the plant's
three reactors, which began began operation in 1954, is restricted
to 50 percent of full power due to safety concerns.
   ``We will provide the secretary with an estimate of what it takes
and when ... by the end of the month,'' said Starostecki.
   A spokeswoman for DuPont at Savannah River, Becky Apter, said
``the last date I heard was Dec. 31,'' and that was subject to delay.
   Starostecki said the Energy Department would develop what he
called ``compensatory'' operating procedures to allow safe operation
of the facilities. For Savannah River, those steps include:
   _Requiring reactor operators to practice accident control
techniques extensively on a simulator;
   _Requiring the presence of a degree-holding engineer in the
control room;
   _Adding more highly trained managers and operators to the staffs
of the contractor and the regional department office;
   _Reorganizing and improving communication between contractor and
departmental employees, in particular assuring that those who manage
and analyze the plant are in close contact with those in the control
room;
   _Developing detailed technical criteria on the operation of the
plant, and making sure it is in the hands of the operators, a step
which has not been taken before;
   _Analyzing the ability of the reactors to withstand earthquakes,
a process now underway.

   Michael Dukakis ran ``the worst campaign of
this century,'' says one Democrat, but others blamed the party
itself for losing touch with the people while some said nothing
could overcome the Republican claim to peace and prosperity.
   Robert Slagle, the Democratic state chairman in Texas, gave no
quarter to his party's fallen standard-bearer in his election
post-mortem Wednesday.
   ``The Dukakis campaign ran the worst campaign of this century,''
said Slagle. ``Those guys up there in Boston wrapped themselves in a
cocoon and I don't know what kind of folks they're used to talking
to, but they didn't put a message out that was appealing to Texans.''
   James Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said
Democrats must change the perception that they are weak on defense.
   ``This race was winnable,'' he went on. ``And we didn't win it.
But that's more a fault of the campaign that we ran. ... Mike
Dukakis will get a lot of blame, deserved or not deserved, but he
will get it.''
   Kathy Vick of Louisiana, a former chairman of the Association of
State Democratic Party Chairs, said, ``We're in this position where
we can elect everybody but a president.''
   ``We left Atlanta (site of the Democratic National Convention)
thinking we could win,'' she said. ``Nobody thought it was going to
be a lead-pipe cinch. ... It ended up not being close.''
   Other prominent Democrats were more circumspect.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said on CBS ``This Morning'' that with the
party's gains in the House and Senate, ``you really should not be
finger-pointing and blaming too much.''
   ``We've done an awful lot of right things to be as strong as we
are as a party,'' he said.
   Robert Strauss, the former Democratic party chairman, said, ``I
think the campaign got away from (Dukakis) in August and September.
... He let the Republicans define him into something he really
wasn't and he never got back on track.''
   Strauss said the Democrats need ``to take a look at the whole
card.''
   ``There's obviously a disconnect between the primary system and
the American people insofar as Democrats are concerned,'' he said.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the party whip in the House, said on
NBC TV's ``Today'' show, ``The Democratic party has to look West _
that's the area of opportunity for the Democrats.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the party's nominee must ``cross the
threshhold issues in the South'' with strong stands on national
security, patriotism and crime. ``We've got to broaden the base of
the people who consider themselves to be Democrats,'' Nunn said on
the ``Today'' show.
   Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst and publisher of the
American Political Report, said: ``The Democratic problem was
two-thirds Dukakis. If he had been able to do in July and August ...
what he did in late October with his spurt, I think they'd have been
looking at a different situation.''
   But other political analysts said Bush's margin _ 54 percent of
the popular vote and 426 of the 538 electoral votes _ was so wide
that defeat really cannot be blamed on any Dukakis foibles.
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said:
``Dukakis didn't blow it. He could have run better obviously. ...
The fundamentals of peace and prosperity were just too hard for
Democrats to overcome.''
   Bill Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, said: ``I don't think they could have won. My guess in
the end what defeated them was peace and prosperity. ... I don't
think Lloyd Bentsen would have won this election at the top of the
Democratic ticket.
   ``Dukakis does not deserve all the blame he is going to get for
this loss. People are going to blame Dukakis as a way of avoiding
the harsh truth about where the Democratic Party is today.''

   President Reagan says he vetoed a bill to
coordinate federal policy and advice on nutrition because it would
have created an ``unnecessary and complex federal bureaucracy.''
   Backers of the bill said it was designed to make the government
speak with one voice on nutrition instead of having several agencies
an departments issue conflicting advice to the public.
   ``The administration strongly supports the principal goals of
this legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existing
authority to achieve these ends,'' Reagan said in a statement
Wednesday. ``However, enactment of the bill would set up federal
nutrition efforts on the wrong course.
   ``The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the
bill's goals,'' he said.
   Reagan also vetoed a bill requiring specific questions in the
1990 census relating to plumbing facilities and heating and cooling
equipment. He said the questions would not produce enough useful
information to justify the increased cost and paperwork.
   The nutrition bill gave shared responsibility for the program to
the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human
Services and would also have created an administrator of nutrition
monitoring, an interagency board and an advisory council.
   ``The creation of so much new federal bureaucracy would hinder,
rather than aid, performance of federal nutrition-related
functions,'' Reagan said.
   The bill also would ``impose a substantial new burden on the
American taxpayer in future years to pay for federal government
grants'' by requiring that a grant program be established as a
result of the study, he said.
   ``Experience shows that once the federal government begins
handing out money under a new grant program, a political
constituency develops that demands greater funding for that
program,'' the president said.

<HEAD>US Gives Afghan Rebels Green Light To Carry Fight To the Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP ) _ The Afghan rebels have the apparent
endorsement of the Reagan administration in their latest drive
against Soviet troops and government forces.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said after reviewing the
situation Wednesday with a top rebel leader: ``We see it eye to
eye.''
   There were no U.S. calls for restraint as Burhanuddin Rabbani
held back-to-back meetings with President Reagan and Shultz.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we will continue to
provide support for the Mujahedeen as long as the Soviet Union is
providing support for the Kabul regime. And we would not intervene
to direct their activities beyond that.''
   About 50,000 Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan. They are due to
leave by Feb. 15. But last Friday, citing rebel attacks, the Soviets
announced a suspension.
   In the meantime, the Soviets brought in new missiles and fighter
planes, and used the weapons against the rebels, who are armed by
the United States.
   Rabbani said ``we are ready to talk to the Russians directly, to
know what their worries are about the withdrawal of their troops.''
   But he said the guerrilla attacks would continue as long as the
Soviets remained.
   Last week, State Department officials urged both the rebels and
the Soviets to show restraint. The aim was to maintain the Red
Army's exodus from Afghanistan after nearly nine year of fighting.
   Rabbani, in his meetings here, evidently got a green light to
keep up the pressure. Both Shultz and Fitzwater left that impression.
   Referring to the rebels, Shultz said ``they are being attacked.
The Soviets should not have troops in Afghanistan in the first
place. So they should leave as they agreed to.''
   Rabbani declared, meanwhile, that the guerrillas had decided to
close the main road used by Soviet troops to leave Afghanistan.
   ``It is true,'' he said.
   However, he left open whether the rebels would launch a military
operation against the Red Army in the Kabul area.
   ``It would depend on the military situation,'' Rabbani said.
``Our aim is peace. But if the Russians intensify the war, we have
no choice.''
   The road, much of which is tunneled, leads from the capital
northward to the Soviet Union.

   A private health advocacy group is calling for
an immediate halt to the use of silicone implants for breast
enlargement even as the Food and Drug Administration has started a
review of the issue that will take at least two years.
   In a letter to FDA Commissioner Frank Young released Wednesday,
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, head of Public Citizen Health Research Group,
also said the agency should issue an immediate alert telling the
estimated 2 million women who have had such procedures they may run
a heightened risk of health problems, including cancer.
   The agency has already scheduled a meeting of its plastic surgery
devices advisory panel to review potential health problems that may
be caused by silicone breast implants. It issued a background paper
on the topic last week.
   The FDA said it has invoked a procedure whereby silicone gel
implants will have to undergo the type of scientific review normally
associated with new medical devices even though the implants were
already on the market in 1976. That was the year Congress gave the
FDA authority over such products, which were given ``grandfather''
approval under the legislation.
   The FDA said it decided ``there are sufficient concerns about
these products to call for premarket approval applications. This
means that in order for the implants to remain on the market,
manufacturers will have to supply FDA with scientific data
demonstrating that they are safe and effective.''
   The agency noted that the law sets a schedule giving the makers
of such ``grandfathered'' products time to provide documentation for
the safety of their products and said in the case of silicone
implants, ``the deadline can be no sooner than December 1990.''
   The advisory panel will be asked specifically to recommend what
kind of scientific data manufacturers should be required to submit.
   While the full review is in progress, the FDA said it will see
that the labeling information manufacturers are required to supply
doctors ``explains adequately what is known about potential risks.''
   The FDA document said the agency ``has been increasingly
concerned about reports of adverse effects from breast implants,
particularly in view of the large number of women who receive them.''
   The agency said about 130,000 breast implants are done per year,
most for cosmetic purposes. About 15 percent involve women having
breast reconstruction after cancer surgery.
   ``There have been reports of fibrous tissue growth around
implants, which can cause a painful hardening of the breast,'' the
FDA document said. ``It is also possible that the implants could
interfere with mammography pictures of the breast.''
   Moreover, it said, ``small quantities of the gel have also been
shown to migrate throughout the body, and this has raised questions
about possible effects on the immune system and the fetus.''
   The agency also referred to a study by Dow Corning Corp., a major
manufacturer of silicone gel, that showed the gel can produce tumors
in laboratory rats.
   ``Although it is unlikely that this finding is relevant to
humans, the possibility of a cancer risk cannot be completely ruled
out,'' the FDA said.
   Dow Corning said in a statement that ``based on broad experience
with implants for more than two decades,'' it has confidence in
their safety.
   ``Patients who have had such surgery, or who are considering it,
face no significant risk, based on all the data available to date,''
the company said.
   It added that Dow Corning and other implant manufacturers ``have
been working with the FDA to determine whether any further studies
are needed to document the safety of breast implants'' and that Dow
has told the agency it ``is committed to conducting any such studies
expeditiously.''

   A man shot and killed a deputy sheriff and
his ex-wife before fatally shooting himself with the .22-caliber
rifle Wednesday, police said.
   Two young boys inside the trailer home where the shootings took
place were uninjured, Department of Public Safety spokesman David
Wells said.
   Comanche County Deputy David Jones, 59, was shot as he approached
the trailer in this central Texas town on a domestic disturbance
call about 1:45 a.m., Wells said.
   The home's occupant, 30-year-old Elizabeth Jane Green, then ran
out of the house and was shot several times by her former husband,
Billy Jackson McDonald, Wells said. McDonald, 39, then placed the
rifle's muzzle under his chin and pulled the trigger, he said.
   A next-door neighbor, Terry Dolberry, was shot in the arm as he
approached the house during the disturbance, Wells said. He was
treated at a hospital and released.
   The couple's divorce went through last month, Wells said. Ms.
Green's two sons, ages 8 and 10, were not harmed, he said, adding
that the boys were not fathered by McDonald.

   Republican hopes that a strong presidential run
by George Bush would provide the impetus needed to pick off a few
Democratic members of the House seem to have gone unfulfilled.
   With vote-counting complete for all but three races for the 435
House seats, there is little evidence that Bush's victory did very
much _ if anything _ for GOP House hopefuls.
   By late Wednesday, Democrats had boosted their overall majority
in the chamber to 259 to 173, a pickup of two seats, and led in all
three undecided contests. They padded the 77-39 edge they had held
in the 100th Congress in the 11 states of the old Confederacy by two
seats, even though Bush swept the South.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, boasted Wednesday that Bush had
shown no coattails at all.
   ``In fact, in his home state of Texas, where we picked up two
Republican House seats, he must have been wearing a tear-away
jersey.''
   Republicans conceded almost as much.
   ``Congressional races, particularly House races, are not national
elections,'' said Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., who heads the
National Republican Campaign Committee. ``They're essentially local
races between two people who are fighting it out.''
   In North Carolina, the GOP hoped to knock off three Democratic
incumbents. Not only did all three Democrats win, but one of them _
Rep. David Price _ won by 16 points, enlarging his 12-point victory
of 1986.
   Some other potential coattail victims showed no ill effects from
the Bush win. Always vulnerable Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa.,
enlarged his 10-point 1986 margin to 16 points this time. Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, an 11-point winner in 1986, coasted to a 16-point
edge Tuesday.
   Still others waivered but did not crumble. Freshman Rep. Liz
Patterson, D-S.C., considered a possible loser, defeated GOP
candidate Knox White by four points, just one point less than her
1986 win. And Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., saw his 14-point 1986
victory shrink to 12 points this year.
   The dust had yet to settle in three congressional districts where
thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be counted in tabulations
that may take days.
   Rep. William V. Chappell Jr., held a 1,166-vote lead over
Republican Craig T. James, a political novice, in a district
surrounding Daytona Beach, Fla. Chappell is a 20-year House veteran
and chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee, but his
name has come up in reports on the continuing investigation into the
Pentagon purchasing scandal.
   Democrat Nita Lowey, a former New York assistant secretary of
state, clung to a 2,594-vote lead over two-term GOP Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi in Westchester County. His prospects were hindered by
reports that he accepted $57,000 in illegal campaign contributions
from an auto dealer.
   And south of Portland, Ore., four-term GOP Rep. Denny Smith
trailed state legislator Mike Kopetski by 1,573 votes.
   So far, only four incumbents seeking re-election had lost.
   The most prominent was Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St
Germain, D-R.I., whose 28-year House career was ended by Republican
newcomer Ronald Machtley. St Germain, investigated by the Justice
Department earlier this year on allegations that he accepted favors
from lobbyists, is likely to be succeeded as committee chairman by
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., was defeated by Ben Jones, who played
good ol' boy Cooter on television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' in a
mud-slinging contest that focused on Swindall's perjury indictment
in a government drug probe.
   Democrat Greg Laughlin beat GOP Rep. Mac Sweeney in the Texas
13th District, and former state Sen. George Sangmeister denied
Republican Rep. Jack Davis of the Illinois 4th District a second
term.

   Byron Vest Boone, a Tulsa attorney and
businessman who was publisher of the Tulsa World for nearly 30
years, died Wednesday at his home after several years of illness. He
was 80.
   The longtime newspaperman also was director of F&M Bank and Trust
Co. and the Newspaper Printing Corp., the agency that prints and
runs the business functions of the Tulsa World and The Tulsa Tribune
under a joint-operating agreement. He also served as trustee or
director of several other businesses and organizations, including
the University of Tulsa.
   Boone had joined his father's law firm after graduating from the
University of Tulsa law school in 1929.
   Boone's association with the Tulsa World began in the late 1930s,
when he served as personal attorney to Eugene Lorton, the morning
newspaper's owner. Boone was named general counsel and a director of
the World Publishing Co. in 1947.
   Lorton died in 1949. Boone was named publisher of the newspaper
in 1959 when Lorton's widow, Maud Lorton Myers, resigned.

   George Bush's solid victory lacked the majority
support of several voter groups, including moderates and Roman
Catholics, that would be crucial to a lasting Republican
realignment, say poll analysts.
   The share of voters calling themselves Democrats went up compared
with 1984, an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll found, while
Republican numbers held about steady. Democrats thus were able to
gain in other races.
   ``The Republicans have held on to the numbers they had in 1984,
but the Democrats have gone back to their numbers in 1980,'' said
Laurily Epstein, NBC's chief pollster. ``Despite the Bush victory,
we've gone back to a situation where the Democrats are the majority
party.''
   Overall, the polls said Bush stitched together enough of the
Reagan coalition of 1980 and 1984 to win the election handily. But
they indicated that majority support from some key groups was
lacking:
   _Catholics voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976, but solidly for Reagan
in 1980 and 1984. Tuesday they went back to the Democrats, backing
Dukakis by 52-48 percent in NBC-Journal exit polling.
   _Reagan split women with Carter in 1980 and won women in 1984.
Tuesday, a majority of women voted for Dukakis.
   _Moderates backed Carter in 1976, then moved to Reagan in the
next two elections. Tuesday they voted for Dukakis, by 54-46 in
NBC-Journal polling.
   Bush also won independents by smaller margins than Reagan's. And
while he pulled in 17 percent of Democrats in CBS News-New York
Times polling, that was down from Reagan's roughly 25 percent in
1980 and '84.
   Bush's support also seemed to lack a strong personal endorsement
from the voters, pollsters said. And his recreation of the Reagan
coalition paled in comparison, even if partly because Reagan's
popularity is so great.
   ``I don't think there's a mandate in this data for George Bush,''
said CBS News pollster Warren Mitofsky. ``It's certainly a
comfortable victory. But there's no overwhelming sentiment for what
might be in his new presidency.''
   In ABC News exit polling, for example, 45 percent of Bush's
voters said they opposed Dukakis more than they supported Bush. In
an even stronger gauge, 14 percent of Bush backers in NBC-Journal
polling gave dislike of Dukakis as the primary reason for their vote.
   Prosperity was a Bush trump card. In one survey, most voters said
the economy had improved since 1980, and overwhelmingly they backed
Bush. In another, the economy was the most-often cited issue in
candidate selection, and a majority of those voters took Bush.
   ``It was a pretty clear economic kind of thing,'' Epstein said.
``People who said they had benefited from the Reagan
administration's economic policies voted for Bush. People who said
they hadn't, voted for Dukakis.''
   Other issues played in Bush's favor _ such as his experience and
his stands on crime _ and he sustained little damage from concern
over the qualifications of his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, the
polls found.
   Most striking, said Epstein, was the increase in the number of
voters identifying themselves as Democrats. In the NBC-Journal poll,
31 percent said they were Republicans, compared to 32 percent in the
1984 election. But 38 percent said they were Democrats, compared to
33 percent in 1984.
   The movement in party identification did not harm Reagan's
popularity. About 55 percent in the CBS-Times poll said they
approved of his work as president, while only about 40 percent
disapproved; the rest had no opinion.
   The strongly positive rating rubbed off on Bush: Reagan approvers
backed him by 4-1, while the minority who disapproved went for
Dukakis, 9-1.
   The CBS-Times, ABC and NBC-Journal polls each involved surveys
with more than 10,000 voters leaving their polling places. The
CBS-Times and ABC polls had two-point margins of error; the
NBC-Journal poll, three points.

   Ngiratkel Etpison, a businessman and advocate
of a new political status with the United States, won Palau's
presidency today by a narrow margin and with only 26 percent of the
vote.
   Complete but unofficial returns showed the 63-year-old Etpison
edging Roman Tmetuchl, 62, by 39 votes of the 9,044 votes cast in
the tiny Western Pacific island chain.
   Etpison will succeed Thomas O. Remengesau, who finished third.
   Remengesau, a long-time government service employee, became
Palau's president on Aug. 20 when Lazarus Salii committed suicide.
   Salii was elected president and Remengesau vice president in a
special 1985 election after the assassination of Palau's first
president, Haruo I. Remeliik.
   Palau, with an estimated 15,000 residents living on eight of its
200 islands, is the world's last trusteeship, established in 1947 by
the United Nations. Its affairs are administered by the United
States.
   For years, Palau, 600 miles east of the Philippines and 4,500
miles southwest of Hawaii, has sought a proposed Compact of Free
Association with the United States that would give it self-rule.
   The proposed 50-year pact, which would bring the island state an
estimated $460 million in economic aid in the first 15 years, has
failed to receive a constitutionally required 75 percent approval
from Palauans. The U.S. Congress, before it adjourned last month,
failed to approve legislation to implement the compact.
   Etpison, governor of Palau's smallest state, supports the pact.
   Returns from the Nov. 2 election showed Etpison receiving 2,383
votes, or 26.3 percent. Tmetuchl, a businessman who was making his
third run for the presidency since the nation adopted constitutional
government eight years ago, received 2,344 votes, or 25.9 percent.
Remengesau received 1,761 votes, or 19.5 percent.
   Four other candidates divided the rest of the vote.
   There is no runoff election when a winning candidate receives
less than a majority. Losing candidates have 10 days to challenge
the outcome before the vote is officially certified.
   Kuniwo Nakamura, 45, easily won the vice presidency.
   The winners will take office in January.

   The presidential campaign is over, but the spat
over the ``L'' word continues between composer-conductor Leonard
Bernstein and conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr.
   The tiff began when Bernstein, in an Oct. 30 opinion essay in The
New York Times, decried efforts to besmirch the word ``liberalism.''
   Buckley retaliated in a Nov. 2 column that recalled a meeting
Bernstein held at his New York apartment in 1970, at which leaders
of the Black Panthers chatted with the cultural elite. That
get-together was lampooned in Tom Wolfe's book ``Radical Chic, or
Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers.''
   ``Lenny does not realize that one of the reasons the `L' word is
discredited is that it was handled by such as Leonard Bernstein,''
Buckley wrote.
   In the latest exchange between the two, Bernstein wrote an open
letter to the columnist that ran in Wednesday's Daily News, which
syndicates Buckley. ``Your column,'' Bernstein told Buckley, ``is
beneath your dignity.''
   ``Liberal is a word soiled by the greedy, reactionary,
back-looking impulse toward tyranny,'' Bernstein said.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell didn't figure to be
picking up a tab for Larry Flynt. But that's what a judge has
ordered him to do in the latest rebuff of his lawsuit against the
Hustler magazine publisher.
   First, the Lynchburg evangelist failed to prove he had been
libeled by a Hustler ad parody that portrayed him as an incestuous
drunkard; then, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a $200,000 award
he received for ``intentional emotional distress.''
   Now, in a closed court session last week, U.S. District Judge
James Turk ruled that Falwell must pay $20,258.55 in costs assessed
from the lawsuit.
   Turk said Falwell waited too long to object to the costs assessed
for witness fees and deposition and trial transcripts, which include
Flynt's. Turk also said in the ruling, filed Monday, that even if
Falwell had filed his objection on time it would have had no merit.

   Everyone may be equal under the law, but it
doesn't hurt if you're the son of a famous actress who was once
married to a U.S. Senator. Ask actor Michael Wilding.
   President Reagan on Wednesday signed a bill to grant Wilding a
resident visa despite a drug conviction 14 years ago in Wales. The
bill was sponsored by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who said he came to
know and respect Wilding when he was married to the actor's mother,
actress Elizabeth Taylor.
   The bill would exempt Wilding, the 34-year-old son of Miss Taylor
and the late British actor also named Michael Wilding, from a law
prohibiting people with drug violations from being granted residence
status.
   Wilding lives in New York City and is in the cast of the
television soap opera ``The Guiding Light.'' He was convicted in
Wales in 1974, three years after renouncing his U.S. citizenship, of
possessing marijuana and cultivating marijuana plants.

   Exiled Soviet psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin,
who accused the government of sending sane people to mental
institutions, has received the Humanization of Medicine prize for
his work for patients' rights.
   The winner of the award, a gold plaque and $20,000, is selected
every two years by Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
   Koryagin, who now lives in a suburb of Zurich, received the award
Wednesday during a conference at the Vatican on the ``Longevity and
Quality of Life.''
   The award citation said Koryagin was honored because of his
struggle ``against bureaucratic indifference and the enslavement of
psychiatry for political purposes.'' It also noted his ``tireless
support for the physical and mental well being of his patients, who
were often treated inhumanly.''
   Koryagin was sent to a labor camp in 1981 after accusing
authorities of sending sane people to mental institutions. He
arrived in Switzerland in April 1987, two months after he was
released from prison.

<HEAD>Quake Shakes Northern California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake shook a wide area
of Northern California on Wednesday evening, but there were no
immediate reports of injury or major damage.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park reported a preliminary
magnitude of 4.5 on the Richter scale with an epicenter 11 miles
northeast of San Jose on the Calaveras Fault.
   The temblor occurred at about the same location as a magnitude
5.0 quake on June 12, which caused moderate damage.
   ``It was just a little shaking, one small shake followed by
another one,'' said Margo Gildea of Oakland, who studies earthquakes
as a hobby.
   Although the quake was not a major one, it was unusual in that it
could be felt over such a wide distance.
   The temblor was felt at least as far as 200 miles to the north in
Eureka, 120 miles to the south in Seaside in Monterey County, and
180 miles to the east in Stockton.
   Police in San Francisco, San Jose and other Bay area communities
received dozens of phone calls. Police said they received no reports
of injuries or major damage.
   Several callers to KCBS radio station in San Francisco said items
were shaken off store shelves in the San Jose area.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Each increase of one number on the scale means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause
moderate damage, while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Go Separate Ways; One Planning Presidency; Other to
Statehouse</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis, locked together in political
combat for so many months, are going their separate ways: the
Republican vice president to plan the next administration, his
vanquished Democratic opponent to resume his duties as governor of
Massachusetts.
   After taking the first steps toward the transfer of power next
January, Bush was leaving today on a brief vacation fishing off the
coast of Florida.
   The president-elect returned to Washington Wednesday and received
a tumultuous welcome at Andrews Air Force Base from supporters that
included his vice president-elect, Dan Quayle.
   ``He's going to be one of the great vice presidents,'' Bush said
of the Indiana senator who stood smiling behind him on the platform.
``You watch him closely, America.''
   Back at the Massachusetts Statehouse, Dukakis told a news
conference he was looking forward to resuming his duties as governor
``vigorously and fully.''
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' he said of the losing campaign.
   Many of his fellow Democrats were complaining that his best shot
was not good enough.
   ``The Dukakis campaign ran the worst campaign of this century,''
said Robert Slagle, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. Slagle
complained particularly about Dukakis' failure to respond quickly to
attacks from the Bush campaign.
   ``You just don't let people do that sort of thing to you,'' said
the Texas Democrat.
   ``This race was winnable,'' said James Ruvolo, the Ohio
Democratic Party chairman. ``Michael Dukakis will get a lot of
blame, deserved and not deserved.''
   In the presidential race, Bush won 40 states with 426 electoral
votes, while Dukakis carried 10 states and the District of Columbia
for a total of 112 electoral votes.
   But the new president will have to deal with a solidly Democratic
Congress when he takes office on Jan. 20, a fact Bush obviously had
in mind when he told the airport crowd that ``I'm going to do
everything I can to have a good and open and friendly relationship
with the United States Congress.''
   With the outcome certain from all but one race, the Democrats
stood to gain one and possibly two Senate seats. The unsettled race
was the contest between Republican Rep. Connie Mack III and
Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay for the seat being vacated by Florida
Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   Mack had a slight lead as officials counted 100,000 absentee
ballots.
   If Mack wins that race, the Democratic majority in the Senate
would be 55 to 45. If MacKay pulls it out, the Democrats would have
a 56-44 margin.
   Despite the Bush victory, Democrats were also adding to the House
majority. With three races still too close to call, the Democrats
had won 259 seats compared to 173 for the GOP. The Democratic
candidates held narrow leads in the three unsettled races.
   Only about half the eligible voters bothered to cast ballots in
the 1988 election, according to Curtis Gans, director of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, the lowest
turnout percentage since 1924.
   ``We had an unprecedented number of voters who said they didn't
like either candidate,'' said Gans.
   In his valedictory press conference, Dukakis touched once again
on the negative tone of the long campaign.
   The Republican attacks ``had an impact on me,'' said Dukakis.
When asked whether he thought the success of those attacks would
result in more negative campaigning in the future, he replied, ``I
fear that this will be a signal at the national level that this kind
of campaigning is effective campaigning. I certainly hope not.''
   Bush moved quickly to set the transition in motion.
   He announced Wednesday morning that he would name old friend and
campaign chairman James A. Baker III his secretary of State. Baker
served the Reagan administration as White House chief of staff and
then Treasury secretary.

<TEXT>
   Nearly two decades after a child with a penchant
for hiding things stashed his great-grandmother's ashes in the
attic, a contractor renovating the house found them.
   Bill Griffiths discovered the urn containing Louisa Godden's
ashes Monday in the ceiling above the front door of the home in
suburban Glen Cove.
   ``When we first saw the can, we didn't know what it was. When we
saw on the label, `remains of,' we knew what it was'' Griffith said
Wednesday.
   ``We didn't want to throw it away on the Dumpster and send it out
to sea,'' the contractor said. ``I knew if it was my grandmother or
great-grandmother, I would want to know.''
   Griffith called the Long Island newspaper Newsday. A friend of
James Kingston, who hid the urn, saw the story.
   Kingston's grandparents lived in the house until they moved to
Alpine, Calif., in 1977, said John Kunit, Kingston's grandfather and
the dead woman's son-in-law.
   Kingston, a 30-year-old contractor living in Alpine, said he
remembers putting the urn in the attic when he was about 11.
   ``It's a real good hiding spot,'' he said. ``I figured if anybody
found it, it would really shake them up.''
   ``He was always up to something when he was a kid,'' said
Kingston's grandmother, Ethel Kunit.
   The Kunits lost track of the urn after they moved. Kunit said he
thought his son, Don, had taken it with him. ``We thought he had it,
he loved his grandmother so much, and he thought we had it,'' he
said.
   News that her mother's ashes had been found was ``a very big
surprise, a shock, in fact,'' Mrs. Kunit said.
   The family friend who notified the Kunits has sent the urn to the
family in California; they expect to receive it soon.
   Kingston said he liked to leave notes about who had lived in the
house in hiding places. He also buried dead animals in cans with
messages. ``God only knows what's in there,'' he said.
   Crews renovating the house have stumbled across Kingston's
``little attempt at immortality,'' Griffiths said. ``Every once in a
while we take a ceiling down and down come memorabilia _ little time
capsules.''

<HEAD>Evidence Of Hereditary Link To Schizophrenia Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study has found evidence of a hereditary link
to schizophrenia, and the discovery could help scientists find new
treatments for the disorder that strikes one person in 100.
   The study published today found evidence that a single gene may
help trigger the disease and may predispose people to a personality
disorder that makes them loners or to other mental conditions
thought unrelated to schizophrenia.
   Two other studies, however, found no evidence of the gene.
   The researchers studied 104 members of seven families from
Iceland and Great Britain that had displayed multiple cases of
schizophrenia in at least three generations.
   The study included 39 schizophrenics, five people with ``schizoid
personality disorder'' and 10 people with conditions such as
depression that are not thought related to schizophrenia. It found
that family members who apparently inherited the gene may have
acquired an 86 percent risk of developing schizophrenia or one of
the other disorders.
   The work was done by Hugh Gurling of the University of London
with colleagues there, at the University of Southampton in England,
at the California College of Medicine in Irvine, and in Reykjavik,
Iceland.
   Two studies of other families have found no evidence of the
proposed gene, showing it could not be linked to all cases of
schizophrenia, researchers said.
   ``For all we know, this could be a very minor cause of
schizophrenia that only affects some families in Iceland, or it
could be a major cause,'' said Eric Lander of the Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass.
   Other scientists also said the new work does not prove the gene
exists.
   Lander, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study in
today's issue of the British journal Nature, said such genetic
research may help researchers split schizophrenia into distinct
diseases. That might help in finding treatments, he said.
   Schizophrenia, which includes severe distortions in perception,
speech and thoughts, usually appears in adolescence or early
adulthood. A schizophrenic may believe incorrectly that he is the
target of a plot or that his thoughts are broadcast to others.
   People with schizoid personality disorder prefer to be loners.
They do not enjoy close personal relationships and say they rarely
feel strong emotions.
   Genes are inherited chemical blueprints that govern the structure
and functioning of individual cells in the body. Disease can result
when a gene is damaged or some other abnormality appears in its
functioning.
   Genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes. The new
study suggests a gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia lies
somewhere in a particular portion of the chromosome scientists
called number 5.
   The researchers tracked the inheritance of a portion of
chromosome 5 through the families, and compared that pattern with
the occurrence of schizophrenia and the other disorders.
   Results suggested that some gene in the suspected portion of
chromosome 5 confers a susceptibility to schizophrenia. The evidence
was stronger that the gene affects not only schizophrenia, but also
schizoid personality disorder and the seemingly unrelated disorders,
Gurling said in an interview.
   But in his editorial, Lander cautioned that the statistical link
to the seemingly unrelated orders is ``not overwhelming,'' and that
most cases in the general population are probably due to other
causes.
   The evidence linking the gene to schizophrenia alone is ``very
strong'' but ``not overwhelmingly convincing,'' said Ken Kidd,
professor of human genetics, psychiatry and biology at the Yale
University School of Medicine.
   The statistical link is stronger if one considers schizoid
personality disorder as well as schizophrenia, which adds
credibility to the gene hypothesis, he said.
   Kidd is co-author of a study in today's Nature that found
evidence against existence of a gene for schizophrenia in the
chromosome portion Gurling studied. Kidd's study focused on an
extended Swedish family.
   Another researcher, Lynn De Lisi of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, said her work also has failed to find evidence
for the gene Gurling's paper describes.
   Gurling's work is ``just a suggestion ... not a definitive
finding at this point,'' she said.

connection with the recent privatization of the carrier.
   The department, turning down a request by two unions and the

   TWA was taken private on Oct. 24 by its owner and chairman,
financier Carl Icahn. The move has been criticized by the unions
representing pilots and flight attendants at TWA, who argued that it
will drain the airline of cash and weaken its financial condition.
   Representatives of the Independent Federation of Flight

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar lost ground Thursday against the
Japanese yen while share prices inched down on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar, which stayed on the 123-yen level during its morning
session, closed slightly higher at 124.10 yen. Opening at 123.95
yen, the currency moved in a range of 123.76-124.30 yen. It closed
Wednesday at 124.65.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, a 205.51-point winner
Wednesday, lost 46.36 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 28,166.42.
   Foreign exchange dealers said it was difficult to feel bullish
toward the dollar, with large sell orders blocking the dollar's
potential recovery.
   The dollar's slide followed its sharp overnight decline on
overseas markets stemming mainly from uncertainties toward the
improvement of the U.S. trade and budget deficits following Bush'
victory, said Takamasa Yamasaki with the Daiwa Bank.
   ``The market had some uncertainties over Bush policy before he
actually starts his job as president,'' he said. ``But speculative
investors were buying the dollar to collect profits, and the dollar
is unlikely to drop further.''
   Yamasaki said the Bank of Japan had intervened intermittently in
the markets to save the U.S. currency from further declining.
   The central bank does not comment on its activities. But Kyodo
News Service quoted an unidentified Bank of Japan source as saying
it would take swift action to stem the yen's rapid rise against the
dollar.
   It also quoted Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as saying the
yen's further rise was not good and it was time for the central bank
to intervene.
   On the stock exchange, Bush's victory had a positive effect on
the market, but the yen's rapid rise kept some investors on the
sidelines, said a dealer with a major Tokyo securities firm,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Children in Alaska Town Submit to Blood Tests For Lead Exposure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Nearly all the children in the historic
gold rush town of Skagway submitted to blood tests this week to
determine if they've been contaminated by exposure to another metal:
lead.
   Alarming levels of lead recently were discovered in Skagway's
soil. A terminal where truckloads of lead and zinc ore concentrate
are loaded onto ships has operated at the edge of the scenic
southeast Alaskan tourist town for about 20 years.
   Preliminary tests showed lead levels up to 560 times the level
naturally found in Skagway's soil. State environmental officials
said Wednesday they had directed the terminal operator to act
immediately to limit the powdery ore's spread from the terminal.
   State health officials said they will continue to take blood and
urine samples through Friday from any resident who wants to be
tested. Officials have asked all pregnant women, children and
families of terminal workers to submit to the tests because they are
most at risk of lead poisoning, which can result in brain damage or
death.
   Officials this week decided to take 50 urine samples from people
in high-risk groups because exposure to some of the metals can be
more accurately traced that way, said Dr. Michael Jones of the
Alaska Public Health Division.
   By late Wednesday, about 150 people had been tested, including
most children of school age and younger, and three pregnant women,
Jones said. Skagway, which is nearly 100 miles northwest of Juneau,
has about 790 residents.
   Katherine Kelley, chief of the division's laboratory section in
Juneau, said the samples will be tested at the federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta and at a lab in Massachusetts.
   ``It sounds like it's going to be about three weeks from Sunday
before we get our first inkling of what the numbers look like,''
said Dick Stokes, regional supervisor for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   The samples will be tested for lead and possibly for zinc,
mercury, cadmium and other elements, Jones said. Officials last week
said the soil tests also showed higher than normal levels of those
elements.
   Stokes said the state had sent Bowhead Equipment Co., the
terminal operator, a letter ordering additional steps to limit lead
exposure.
   Tractor-trailer rigs carrying huge drums of lead and zinc ore
concentrate lumber through town every 35 minutes _ 24 hours a day,
362 days a year _ from a mine at Faro in Canada's Yukon Territory.
State and federal officials and residents previously gave little
thought to the ore the trucks tracked through the streets.
   Stokes said Bowhead was told to strictly control access to the
terminal, which borders a ferry and cruise ship dock where thousands
of tourists disembark each spring and summer. At a town hall meeting
last week, some residents expressed concern that tourists who walk
through the terminal have unwittingly tracked lead into town.
   The letter also directs Bowhead to wash trucks that become soiled
with ore after loading or unloading, and to resweep the route they
take through town.
   Bowhead already had begun cleaning up the terminal site. A
1,000-foot section of railroad tracks where lead levels were
extremely high is being removed and the soil will be removed for
processing, terminal manager Gordon Meachum said. Before 1982, ore
was transported to the terminal via rail.
   Testing of soil, well water and Skagway Harbor is continuing to
determine if further cleanup is needed, Stokes said.
   The Department of Environmental Conservation plans to publish a
weekly newsletter to keep residents informed of the lead problem, he
said.
   Kristine Benson of the Alaska Center for the Environment in
Anchorage said she and a representative of the environmental group
Sierra Club will go to Skagway next week to provide residents with
information on lead contamination and legal remedies.
   Benson said residents asked her organization to send a
representative because state and federal agencies had not answered
all their questions.

<HEAD>Afghan Leader Calls For Demilitarization Under International Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's prime minister has called for
the demilitarization of his country under international supervision,
which he said could lead to a coalition government by the end of the
Soviet pullout.
   The prime minister, Mohammad Hassan Sharq, on Wednesday also
condemned the United States for supplying weapons to anti-communist
guerrillas.
   Sharq, who does not belong to Afghanistan's ruling Communist
Party, told reporters his government is ``earnestly hopeful'' the
now-suspended Soviet withdrawal can be completed by the Feb. 15
deadline set in a U.N.-mediated pact last April.
   He indicated, however, that complete withdrawal on schedule
depends on whether Pakistan and the United States continue supplying
arms to the anti-government forces, a practice he said violates the
agreement.
   Sharq said he envisages a neutral, Islamic Afghanistan in which
``there could be no discussion of Marxism.''
   He said his government probably would propose a Security Council
meeting to discuss how to halt arms supplies by Pakistan and the
United States to the Afghan rebels. Sharq spoke in Farsi, through an
interpreter.
   At the time of the April 14 agreement, the United States reserved
the right to continue supplying the guerrillas if the Soviets
continued providing arms to Afghan government forces.
   Last Friday, the Soviets said they were suspending the withdrawal
and delivering new, more powerful weapons to the government because
of continuing guerrilla attacks. MiG-27 ground-attack jets and SS-1
Scud missiles have been seen in Afghanistan.
   On Wednesday in Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
suspending the withdrawal from Afghanistan is an attempt to ensure
full compliance with the Geneva agreement.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. An
estimated 115,000 were there when the withdrawal began May 15 and
about half have been pulled out.
   The withdrawal agreement is between Afghanistan and neighboring
Pakistan, with the United States and Soviet Union signing as
guarantors. The insurgents were not party to it and have continued
the civil war.
   U.N. officials said Wednesday that no formal request for a
Security Council meeting had been received and Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar was ``listening to views'' about the Afghan
situation and a possible international forum.
   Sharq said his government proposes an international conference
under U.N. auspices that would ``register and guarantee the neutral
status of Afghanistan and launch a program for the demilitarization
of the country under international supervision.''
   Sharq, described by the Soviets as a figure of national
reconciliation, has been meeting with U.N. officials in New York,
but said he had not met representatives of either the United States
or Afghan insurgents.
   When asked about the Soviet troop withdrawal, he said: ``We are
earnestly hopeful that with the realization of the facts concerning
our region, the foreign interference would stop and there would be
no reason for such a delay.''
   He said new types of weapons were supplied to the insurgents
after the Geneva agreement was signed. As Soviet soldiers began to
leave, Sharq declared, ``ground-to-ground missiles entered
Afghanistan from the other direction.''
   ``New types of sophisticated and destructive weapons are made
available to the enemies of peace and constitute the major
impediment to implementation of national reconciliation,'' he said.
   Asked about political ideology in a future Afghanistan, the
premier said:
   ``I assure you that my government would not let anybody propagate
against Islam or engage in any activity which would pose a threat to
Islam. There could be no discussion of Marxism by this government
because the people of Afghanistan are predominantly Moslems and they
would not accept any other ideology.''

   Democrats maintained their domination in the nation's
legislatures by holding Republicans to small gains in state races,
and said Wednesday the results strengthened their hand for the
redistricting that will follow the 1990 census.
   Republicans estimated they picked up about 16 to 30 seats Tuesday
in state legislatures, far fewer than in the last two presidential
elections. It also appeared that they lost control of three
legislative chambers.
   Republicans gained 302 seats in 1980 and 330 seats in 1984, when
President Reagan carried state Republicans on his coattails.
   ``It's a loss of epic proportions for the Republicans,'' said
Timothy Dickson, executive director of the Democratic State
Legislative Leaders Association. ``George Bush didn't leave any
fingerprint on the state legislatures.''
   Republicans confessed to disappointment with the outcome of state
races.
   ``We would obviously have liked to pick up some more,'' said
Molly Gaylord, a field director for the Republican National
Committee. She said she hoped for a strong showing in the 1990
elections, the last ones before the redistricting battles of 1991.
   The number of congressional seats allocated to each state is
shuffled every 10 years to reflect population changes. Through their
control of state legislatures, Democrats will be able to redraw
district lines in a way that will keep safe as many congressional
seats as possible for members of their party.
   In spite of the Republicans' assertion that they had gained
seats, the Democrats clearly did better in the number of houses they
controlled.
   Democrats made a net gain of control of one state Senate and
Republicans had a net loss of control of one state House, according
to figures compiled by The Associated Press and the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   Democrats lost 10 chambers in 1980 and seven chambers in 1984,
although they won back some of them in the off-year elections of
1982 and 1986.
   The elections left Democrats in control of 32 state Senates and
36 state Houses, while Republicans controlled 16 Senates and 11
Houses. In some other state bodies, power was evenly split. Nebraska
has a non-partisan, one-house legislature.
   ``We've held where we've needed to hold and we've picked up seats
where we've looked for opportunities,'' the Democrats' Dickson said.
   But Jayne Victor, director of the state and local department of
the Republican National Committee, said, ``We maintained our power
base in key state Senates and had pickups in just about every single
Southern state.''
   The struggle for control of state legislatures centered on New
Mexico, Indiana, Washington state, Oregon, Vermont, and Montana.
   The National Conference of State Legislatures said 25
legislatures were controlled by Democrats, eight were controlled by
Republicans, and nine were split between the parties. Results for
other states were unavailable.
   Democrats took a 26-16 edge to regain control of the New Mexico
Senate, where an even balance of 21 Republicans and 21 Democrats
since 1984 had led to a shifting series of coalitions.
   In Indiana, the home state of Vice President-elect Dan Quayle,
Democrats picked up two seats in the House to draw even with
Republicans, 50 to 50. Democrats also picked up at least three seats
in the Republican-controlled Indiana Senate.
   Republicans appeared to take control of the Vermont House. With
some recounts possible, the balance stood at 76 Republicans and 74
Democrats, in contrast to 77 Democrats and 73 Republicans previously.
   Montana Republicans picked up two seats to gain a 27-23 edge in
the state Senate, which had been evenly divided with the Democrats
at 25-25. But Democrats grabbed control of the state House, 51-49,
the same margin by which the Republicans had controlled the lower
house.
   In Oregon, control of the House was undecided late Wednesday.
Voters elected 23 Democrats and 21 Republicans, but 16 seats were
undecided. Democrats previously had a 31-29 edge.
   In Washington state, a tight Senate race had Republicans and
Democrats with 24 seats apiece and one district still undecided.
Republicans previously had a one-seat advantage, 25-24.
   Pennsylvania Democrats picked up breathing room in the state
House, where they widened their lead to 104-99, from 99-97 and seven
vacancies.
   In Ohio, Republicans slightly widened their lead in the Senate
but continued to trail in the House.
   Among other big states, Democrats in Texas, California and
Florida maintained control of both houses, and Democrats in Illinois
maintained their narrow 31-28 edge in the Senate while keeping a big
lead in the House.
   In New York, Democrats remained firmly in control of the Assembly
and picked up at least one seat in the Republican-dominated Senate.

   Protestant and Roman Catholic church leaders
from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic ended their
``pilgrimage of hope'' on a note of optimism that the troubled
British province might soon know peace.
   ``We're realizing there is no such thing as green (Catholic)
tears or orange (Protestant) tears. The people of Ireland are
weeping together _ and this is significant,'' David Bleakley,
secretary of the Irish Council of Churches, said Monday.
   Bleakley was one of six high-level church delegates from the four
leading denominations of Northern Ireland and the republic who
participated in a three-day ecumenical institute in this Boston
suburb.
   ``A good seed has been planted and surely the harvest will be
bountiful,'' the Rev. James Hiles of the Episcopal Church of Our
Savior said at a news conference. The church sponsored the gathering
to mark the 90th anniversary of the church's founding in part by
Irish immigrants.
   The religious leaders also urged Americans to refrain from
sending donations to paramilitary organizations ``that will destroy
our beloved island.''
   The Most Rev. Robin Eames, archbishop of Ireland's Anglican
church, said the delegation was flatly opposed to misguided American
donations to Northern Ireland, whose current outbreak of political
and sectarian violence began in 1969.
   ``Our message is pure and simple: Money given to paramilitary
organizations is money for death, money for misery and money for
injury. It is pushing back the chance for reconciliation and peace
in Ireland,'' Eames said.
   Many groups in the United States, including the Ireland Fund,
Irish Northern Aid Committee and the Ancient Order of Hibernians,
solicit funds for distribution in Ireland. None acknowledge giving
funds for military use by factions such as the Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army.
   Bleakley joined his interdominational colleagues in urging
Americans to closely monitor their donations. ``Don't take chances
with American dollars,'' he said. ``We've shed tears and suffered
because of money that has come generously from America and been used
woefully.''
   The delegation also included Bishop Cahal B. Daly, whose Roman
Catholic diocese includes Belfast; the Presbyterian moderator in
Ireland, Dr. Godfrey Brown; the Rev. Charles Eyre, general secretary
of the Methodist Church in Ireland; and the Rev. Robert Davidson,
professor of Old Testament at the University of Glasgow.
   The clerics called Northern Ireland's conflict a ``young person's
tragedy,'' and urged educational integration to promote
cross-cultural communication.
   Eames stressed that education was but a part of what he said must
be a peaceful formula for political reform.
   ``It would be wrong if we were to give the impression that
education will be the answer to our problems. It is just a part of
the jigsaw puzzle,'' he said.

   In an effort to keep city residents out
of legal doo-doo, dog owners are signing a pledge to use
``pooper-scoopers'' when they take their pets into public places.
   The City Council has postponed a decision on a law requiring
residents to carry the devices to see if dog owners can solve the
problem themselves.
   ``It is a valid complaint and I'm sure the dog owners of
Sausalito can do better,'' said Doug Lloyd, a financial and real
estate manager who is a leader of the pledge campaign in this town
across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.
   A ``spirit of responsibility'' could take the place of any new
law, which many are likely to ignore anyway, said Lloyd.

   Some editions of Wednesday's Ocala Star-Banner
declared Democrat Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay the winner of Florida's
open U.S. Senate seat, but like Harry Truman 40 years ago,
Republican Connie Mack III could have the last laugh.
   ``Hey Buddy, you're a senator,'' read the headline on 5,000
copies of MacKay's hometown paper.
   Editors decided to use the headline at 2:15 a.m. Wednesday when
MacKay was ahead by 10,000 votes, said Executive Editor Mark Mathes.
Mack later took a small lead as officials began counting the
estimated 100,000 absentee ballots. The final count was not expected
to be complete until sometime today at the earliest.
   MacKay made the most of the attention, holding up a copy of the
newspaper at a news conference in Ocala.
   ``I've been instructed in visual ads in this campaign,'' MacKay
joked as he imitated Harry S. Truman's famous pose in which he held
up a newspaper that had incorrectly declared Thomas Dewey the winner
in the 1948 race for president.
   The Star-Banner was not alone in its early call. All three
television networks named MacKay the winner shortly after 10 p.m.
Tuesday.
   ``The science is not 100 percent,'' said ABC Director of News
Information Elise Adde, who said that of 68 initial projections, ABC
so far has been wrong in one, the Maryland presidential race, by
incorrectly projecting Democrat Michael Dukakis as the winner.

   The Nevada ballot choice ``none of these
candidates'' collected 2 percent of the votes in the presidential

   ``None'' did better in a state Supreme Court race, with 7 percent.
   Nevada is the only state that gives voters this chance to sneer
at the candidates. And voters have used it.
   In the 1980 presidential primary, ``none'' outpolled Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Jimmy Carter narrowly beat ``none.''
   In a 1976 primary, ``none'' got the most votes. The law says
``none'' can't actually win. The runner-up got the nomination.
   Assemblyman Ken Haller said, ``It's a cruel thing to do to
people.''
   State Sen. Don Mello, who introduced the plan in 1975, said,
``Why should you have to go to the polls and vote for the lesser of

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Criticizes West Bank School Closures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West Bank human rights group has charged
Israel is trampling on education and breaking international law by
closing Palestinian schools and universities in its attempt to end
the 11-month-old uprising.
   The group Al Haq, run by Palestinian and Western lawyers, called
Wednesday for the immediate resumption of classes for the 318,000
students in the occupied West Bank.
   ``The closure by the Israeli authorities of schools and
universities for a prolonged period of time is blatantly illegal and
constitutes an illegitimate exercise of power by the Israeli
military,'' the group says in a report entitled ``Israel's War
Against Education.''
   The army ordered all primary and secondary schools in the West
Bank closed on Feb. 3, saying they served as ``centers of violent
protest'' for the Palestinian uprising, which aims to end 21 years
of Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Most of the schools were reopened in May or June, but all were
shut down again in July. Authorities first said a new school year
would begin Sept. 18 but still have not allowed any West Bank
schools to reopen.
   Universities and community colleges have been shuttered since
January.
   The human rights group _ formally known as Al Haq-Law in the
Service of Man and affiliated with the Geneva-based International
Commission of Jurists _ says in the 17-page report that more than
300,000 children and 18,000 college-age students are missing out on
an education.
   It says the closure is illegal under both local and international
law, including the 1949 Geneva Convention designed to protect
civilians in war and under military occupation.
   ``The security rationale put forth by the government to justify
school closing is neither supported by the facts nor the law,'' the
report says. ``It is education itself that is targeted, and that is
intended as another means of penalizing the civilians living under
occupation.''
   An Israeli military official denied the allegations.
   ``We didn't close schools because we don't want the Palestinians
to study,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Each time we've tried to reopen (the schools), they immediately
became again centers of violence and disorder and we had no other
choice but to close them.''
   The official also hinted that the West Bank schools were not
likely to be reopened on Nov. 15, when the current closure order
expires. ``Even today we don't see that the situation is ready to
reopen the system,'' he said.
   Several Israeli newspapers also have reported the reopening may
be delayed. The independent Hebrew daily Ha'aretz said Wednesday
that the army saw the school shutdown as ``an effective means of
pressuring the local population.''
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, at least 310 Palestinians and 11
Israelis have been killed.
   Al Haq noted that while there also have been violent protests in
the Gaza Strip, there have been only selective closures of schools
there. The Gaza Strip had 175,000 students in 365 schools.
   In the West Bank, it said: ``All 1,194 West Bank schools were
closed simultaneously without regard for activities at any specific
institution.''
   It said the blanket closure order appeared ``designed to penalize
the (Palestinian) community as a whole.''
   ``By preventing Palestinian students of all ages from receiving
an education, the Israeli authorities are punishing present and
future generations of Palestinians,'' the report says.
   It also accuses the army of blocking home tutoring of students
and of damaging desks and educational equipment in schools that were
taken over temporily as military camps or detention centers.

<HEAD>PLO Chairman Arafat Likely To Get Visa To Address U.N.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer:</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the objections of Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to visit
the United States later this month to address the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Arab diplomats say Arafat, who along with two PLO diplomats
applied Tuesday for a visa to come to the United Nations, is
expected to announce formation of an independent Palestinian state
on about Nov. 30 and request U.N. observer status for the new PLO
government.
   The Israeli government and Jewish groups already have protested a
visit by the Palestine Liberation Organization chief, and Shultz in
a letter made public Wednesday said he did not welcome a visit by
Arafat.
   Shultz in a Nov. 1 letter to 51 senators who protested any visa
for Arafat wrote, ``Like you, I have no desire whatever to see
Arafat in the United States.''
   The PLO, which has no diplomatic relations with the United
States, is the only organization that must apply for a visa through
the General Assembly.
   Arafat last visited the United Nations in November 1974, when he
delivered a 90-minute speech.
   A U.S. mission spokeswoman, Anne Stoddard, said, ``We do have an
obligation to grant a visa to Arafat under the (U.S.-U.N.)
Headquarters Agreement.'' Under that 1947 agreement the United
States agrees to facilitate and not impede the work of diplomats and
officials on U.N. business.
   The U.S. government has said the PLO is a terrorist organization
and sought to close the PLO's U.N. mission earlier this year.
   ``We do not deem Arafat welcome in any international forum,''
said Israeli Mission Spokesman Barukh Binah. ``But the U.N. commited
the original sin _ the acceptance of the PLO, which is a terrorist
organization in the first place.
   ``The PLO has never changed its covenent which still calls for
the destruction of Israel,'' he said, ``and has never renounced
terrorism or accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338,'' which
recognize the secure borders of Israel.
   The PLO is considered the only legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people and is invited to speak during all Middle East
debates in the General Assembly and in the Security Council.

<HEAD>Arizona Women Can Now Legally Run for Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was largely academic, but Arizona voters
overwhelmingly approved repeal of language in the state constitution
that prohibits women from holding such state offices as governor and
attorney general.
   The state's governor and school superintendnent are women, and
the provisions are considered unenforceable in any case because of
federal law that bars discrimination.
   Repealed were provisions that allow only males to run for
governor, attorney general, state treasurer, secretary of state or
superintendent of public instruction.
   Arizona voters also approved a constitutional amendment requiring
a runoff election whenever the winning candidate for a key state
office has failed to get 50 percent of the vote.
   The proposal was inspired by controversy surrounding Republican
Evan Mecham, who defeated Democrat Carolyn Warner and independent
Bill Schulz for governor in 1986 even though he received only 40
percent of the vote.

   Federal officials better stop ``Pekin'' at a central Illinois
town for a place to build a prison, but voters in an Ohio town
``Warren'' going to pass up a chance for a jail there, according to
votes in those two communities.
   The Pekin voters narrowly rejected a proposal to build a $50
million federal prison on the community's south side.
   Supporters had said the prison would provide jobs for the city of
33,500, while opponents argued the prison would mean more crime,
violence and drugs without bringing in significant new revenue or
jobs.
   In Ohio, the city of Warren had agreed to pay for utility hookups
to a new prison by using as much as $900,000 in city tax reserves.
Tuesday's initiative would have prevented the city from providing
the hookups. City officials had acknowledged that the state couldn't

<HEAD>Oklahoma, New Mexico Voters Approve Change In Bail Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New Mexico voters have passed a constitutional amendment that
would allow denying bail to people with a prior conviction, while
Oklahomans approved an amendment making it easier for judges to hold
suspects without bail.
   The Oklahoma amendment was proposed after the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld a similar federal law. Under the amendment, a judge can
refuse bail in certain drug cases, in violent crimes and for certain
multiple offenses.
   New Mexico's Amendment No. 5, the so-called ``Dena Lynn Gore
amendment,'' will allow bail to be denied for people convicted of a
crime, even if the crime is not a capital offense.
   Dena Lynn Gore was abducted and killed in 1986 by a man free on
bail while appealing his conviction in the earlier rape of a
6-year-old girl.

<HEAD>Contra Leader Warns Against Direct U.S.-Nicaragua Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Contra leader warned President-elect George Bush
against short-circuiting the Central American peace process by
holding direct talks with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``If the new U.S. administration establishes direct negotiations
with the Sandinista regime, it would be violating the democratic
aspirations of the Nicaraguan people,'' Alfredo Cesar said Wednesday.
   Cesar, one of seven Nicaraguan rebel leaders backed by the Reagan
administration, pointed to previous statements by the vice president
that he firmly opposes consolidation of a communist regime in
Nicaragua, and said Bush should try to seek bipartisan support in
Congress for that policy.
   Cesar called for Bush to work through the Central American peace
treaty signed last year by five of the region's presidents,
including Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, rather than a bilateral
approach.
   Another Contra director, hard-line former military commander
Enrique Bermudez, said the struggle in Nicaragua will continue
regardless of Bush's actions.
   The fight ``is not determined by support from the United
States,'' Bermudez said. It is ``Nicaraguans who have made the
decision to fight, by rejecting communism.''
   But in general Contra leaders welcomed Bush's election over
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has strongly opposed
military aid to the rebels.
   ``He is a loyal man,'' Contra director Adolfo Calero said of
Bush. ``The American people said we are happy with the eight years
we had under Reagan ... and that includes, definitely, aid to the
resistance.''
   Calero said that Bush, unlike Dukakis, had sent the Contras a
letter saying he supported their struggle and charging that the
Sandinistas have violated peace agreements.
   ``President-elect Bush has said that if the Central American plan
did not work, he would definitely consider a request for military
aid,'' Calero said. ``The plan is not working, the plan has
practically failed.''
   At a post-victory news conference, Bush said he would continue to
``keep the pressure'' on the Sandinistas to fulfill their
commitments under the peace plan and said military aid to the
Contras ``will have a high priority.''
   The Contras, many of whom have retreated to base camps in
Honduras, are receiving only humanitarian aid from the United States.
   Calero downplayed the importance of Democratic gains in Congress,
noting that some of the new Democratic senators, such as Charles S.
Robb of Virginia and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, supported
the Contras during the campaign.

   Three Republicans who became the first
Republicans ever elected to the Texas Supreme Court could help forge
a new conservative majority on the court, Texas Gov. Bill Clements
said.
   Two of the Republicans, Tom Phillips and Eugene Cook, were

   A third Republican, Dallas appeals court judge Nathan Hecht, was
also elected to the court.
   Phillips becomes the first Republican chief justice since
Reconstruction.
   Democrats came out of the election with a 6-3 majority on the
high court, but Clements predicted the three GOP members will join
forces with Democrats Raul Gonzalez and Jack Hightower to forge a
new conservative majority.
   Hightower, who was ousted from Congress in 1984 after a 10-year
career, was one of the three Democrats elected Tuesday.
   Democratic Justice Raul Gonzalez, who two years ago became the
first Hispanic elected to statewide office in Texas, won re-election.
   The third Democratic winner was Lloyd Doggett, an Austin lawyer
who lost a 1984 U.S. Senate race to Republican Phil Gramm.

<HEAD>Voters Decide Not To Put Mounted Patrol Out To Pasture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city, known for the Golden Gate Bridge,
cable cars and picturesque views, has decided to keep another
historic feature _ its mounted patrol.
   Voters, by 86 to 14 percent, on Tuesday approved a measure
declaring it city policy to keep funding the Police Mounted Horse
Patrol, which supporters claim is the second oldest such group in
North America and older than the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
   Earlier this year, budget problems prompted Mayor Art Agnos to
threaten to scrap the equestrian patrol, which includes 21 horses
and 14 police officers who patrol city parks and beaches.
   Agnos, however, bowing to public pressure, retained the patrol
but cut $250,000 for stable hands, feed and veterinary care. Private
donors have agreed to make up half that amount.

<TEXT>
   An official Vietnamese newspaper today
called on President-elect George Bush to help end the war in
Cambodia and establish diplomatic relations between the United
States and Vietnam.
   The Communist Party daily Nhan Dan said the new administration
should contribute to ``the search for a fair and reasonable
political solution to the Kampuchean (Cambodian) issue and
eventually to the building of a peaceful, independent, democratic,
sovereign, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea, and establishing
normal relations and mutually beneficial cooperation with Vietnam
and other Indochinese countries.''
   The article was quoted by the official Vietnam News Agency,
monitored in Bangkok.
   The United States has said it will not consider normalizing
relations until Vietnam ends its decade-old military occupation of
Cambodia. It also wants a resolution of the fates of Americans
missing in action from the Vietnam war.

<TEXT>
   Planned Parenthood officials hoped an anti-abortion ballot
measure approved in Arkansas would not affect availabilty of some
contraceptives, and pro-choice activists vowed to fight bans on
state abortion funding in Michigan and Colorado.
   Michigan health officials Wednesday reluctantly prepared to
implement a ban on tax-funded abortions for poor women that received
overwhelmingly approval from voters the day before.
   ``I think it's a step backward for public policy in this state to
deny health care access for one group of people, the very poor,''
said C. Patrick Babock, director of the Michigan Department of
Social Services.
   Anti-abortion forces spent $2.3 million to persuade voters to
retain a 1987 law ending state payments for abortions except when
the mother's life is in danger. The pro-choice side was outspent by
3-1.
   The ban won by 57-43 percent.
   The state spends about $5.8 million a year for some 18,600
abortions for low-income women.
   Babcock said he knew of no way to delay implementation of the
measure, but a spokeswoman for a pro-choice group said it will look
for one.
   ``Surely there are some options,'' said Judith Frey, of the
People's Campaign for Choice.
   Barbara Listing, chairwoman of the Committee to End Tax-Funded
Abortions, said the group will make certain the ban takes effect and
try to persuade lawmakers to spend the abortion funds on programs to
help women through crisis pregnancies.
   In Colorado, supporters and opponents of a referendum on a state
law banning abortion funding said the vote didn't end the debate.
   ``I'm not so naive to think this is a mandate on abortion,'' said
William Woodley, who led the fight to uphold the ban. ``But when the
voters understood the issue, they realized they didn't want their
tax dollars paying for abortion.''
   The measure to repeal the ban was defeated 60 percent to 40
percent _ a margin that surprised even the victors.
   Four years ago, the Colorado Constitution was amended to prohibit
state abortion funding. Exceptions include cases where the life of
the pregnant woman or unborn child is endangered and when every
reasonable effort has been made to preserve the life of each.
   Ed Zorenski, spokesman for the defeated amendment campaign, said
his side ``will rebuild and bring it back again.''
   Arkansas' measure, approved by 52-48 percent, bars state funding
of abortions unless the mother's life is in danger. It also says
state policy is to protect ``unborn children'' starting at
conception. Another section states that contraceptives are not
affected by its provisions.
   However, Planned Parenthood of Greater Arkansas expressed fear
that the amendment could be construed to prevent use of the
``morning-after'' pill, which works after conception, even in cases
of rape or incest.
   ``We're asking our opponents to stick to their promises to
respect contraceptives and birth control and to not make those
things illegal so we will have nowhere to go,'' said Chris
Charbonneau, the chapter's executive director.
   Jerry Cox, executive director of the Unborn Child Amendment
Committee, said ``We have no interest in the morning-after pill.''
   Cox said opponents vastly outspent his group. Planned Parenthood
said it spent about $100,000.
   Arkansas currently does not fund abortions.
   Dr. John C. Wilke, head of the National Right to Life Committee,
exulted over the ballot-question results.
   ``This is an honest view of what the public thinks about
(abortion) funding,'' he said.
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the pro-choice Fund for a Feminist
Majority, said the battleground now shifts to the federal level to
block the overturning of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that
legalized abortion.
   ``It isn't going to end until a small minority stops forcing its
way on the rest of us,'' she said.
   Before Tuesday's election, pro-choice advocates had lost only one
of 22 state and local referendums nationwide.
   Thirty-seven states refuse to fund abortions for the poor.

<TEXT>
   The Purdy school board reluctantly agreed to
break its century-old ban on school dances in time for a December
homecoming, but members are still hoping an appeals court will
reinstate the prohibition.
   Carolyn Flummerfelt, a parent who has been fighting for students
trying to stage their first school dance, said she has waited a long
time to hear the board grant approval.
   ``It's finally happened,'' she said. ``It's nice that our high
school students get to do what other high school students do.''
   The six board members unanimously voted Wednesday to suspend the
ban until an appeals court makes a ruling on U.S. District Judge
Russell Clark's order.
   In his ruling in August, Clark said the district must stop
enforcing the dance ban because it unconstitutionally promoted the
values of Purdy residents who opposed dancing for religious reasons.
   Board members appealed Clark's order, but last week the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals denied their request that the order not be
enforced until the appeal was settled.
   ``We must obey the order of Judge Clark, even though we disagree
with it,'' schools Superintendent Sheldon Buxton told the board
members.
   Ransom Ellis III, the attorney representing the school board,
stressed that the suspension was temporary.
   ``The rule is really still on the books, but the application and
enforcement are suspended,'' he said.
   Only one student, Purdy High School student body president Nancy
Fox, attended the brief meeting at which the dance ban was
suspended. Miss Fox said school administrators had cooperated as she
and other students planned a Dec. 10 homecoming dance.
   ``Our administration has been very willing to help and work with
us,'' she said.
   The Purdy school system, centered in a town of about 900 people
50 miles southwest of Springfield, has about 160 students in its
high school.

<HEAD>Civil War Has Reduced Southern Sudan To Graveyard, Minister Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil war has reduced Sudan's south
to a graveyard in the ``most appalling human tragedy in the world
for many years,'' a British overseas development minister says.
   Christopher Patten, who just returned from a two-day trip to the
vast refugee camps Sudanese have fled to in western Ethiopia, said
he had been told the overland route to the camps ``is littered with
corpses or bones of corpses.''
   He estimated at least half the refugees die during the journey,
which can take four months, and appealed to the international
community to press for peace and stability in the rebel-plagued
region of southern Sudan, ``which has been turned into a graveyard
in the last two years.''
   ``The physical condition of the Sudanese refugees in the camps in
western Ethiopia graphically authenticates the appalling experience
of those who had managed to cross the border for a haven in
Ethiopia,'' Patten said Wednesday.
   In the past year, the camps' populations have tripled to more
than 330,000 as the Sudan People's Liberation Army has intensified
its war against Sudan's Moslem government. The rebels took up arms
in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and social and economic reforms for
the predominantly Christian and animist south.
   Patten urged the rebels to allow relief agencies to deliver
humanitarian aid to southern Sudan, where the rebels claim to
control 95 percent of the countryside and towns.
   In September, the rebels ambushed a convoy transporting relief
supplies and killed seven Kenyan truck drivers.
   The killing caused Kenyan drivers to boycott entering southern
Sudan. As a result, more than 1,200 tons of emergency supplies from
the U.N. World Food Program were stranded in Uganda, Sudan's
southern neighbor.
   A World Food-sponsored airlift of supplies started Oct. 26 and
continues.
   The rebels also repeatedly have threatened to shoot down aircraft
_ military or commercial _ that fly over southern Sudan. In 1986 and
1987, the rebels downed two commercial airplanes, killing 73 people.
At least two large cargo jets have been hit this year, but landed
safely.
   Patten also visited camps in eastern Ethiopia that hold about
350,000 Somalis. The refugees started arriving in May, fleeing
fighting between the rebel Somali National Movement and government
troops.
   Patten said their physical condition was much better than that of
the Sudanese refugees, but water was scarce in the region and had to
be trucked to them over poor roads.
   The Ministry of Overseas Development is responsible for all
British aid to Third World countries.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. bid an
emotional farewell to public life, conceding defeat in his attempt
to win a fourth term and vowing never to return to politics after
his first loss in 26 years.
   ``I always said to myself, `When your time comes, walk off that
field. No regrets, no excuses, no blaming, no griping, no comebacks.
Walk off,''' Weicker, 57, said Wednesday, tears in his eyes.
   The liberal Republican lost his seat in a razor-thin upset
Tuesday by Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman, a conservative
Democrat.
   Family, friends and campaign supporters gathered at Greenwich
Town Hall the day after for what Weicker described as his farewell
appearance.
   ``Here is where it began,'' he said. ``Here is where it ends.''
   Weicker, heir to the Squibb pharmaceutical fortune, began his
political career in this exclusive southern Connecticut town in 1962
as a state representative. He won election to the House in 1968 and
the Senate two years later.
   Weicker gained national prominence for early and sharp criticism
of the Nixon administration during the Watergate scandal and later
as a chief opponent of President Reagan's conservative social agenda.
   He became one of the most successful Republicans ever in
Democrat-dominated Connecticut by stressing his independence and
refusal to toe the party line.
   But that maverick streak helped lead to his ouster as many
conservative Republicans, following the lead of National Review
editor William F. Buckley Jr., backed the Democratic challenger.
   Weicker, whose career was highlighted by his stinging rhetoric
and love of a good fight, refused to place the blame on anyone but
himself.
   ``I'm a big guy. I take care of myself. I take shots, I've given
shots,'' he said. ``I'm responsible for last night's results.''
   Official totals gave Lieberman 688,494 votes, or 49.76 percent,
to 678,442, or 49.04 percent, for Weicker, Secretary of State Julia
Tashjian said in Hartford late Wednesday. Two third-party candidates
shared the rest of the vote.
   Tashjian said the 10,052-vote margin represented Connecticut's
tightest statewide election since an attorney general's contest in
1970, but not close enough to order a recount.
   ``I didn't lose this race by a few thousand votes. In my mind and
in my heart, I lost it by 100,000. ... This wasn't a close race,''
Weicker said, calling the result ``a clear mandate by the people of
the state of Connecticut'' and attributing it to support of
Lieberman's positions and opposition to his.
   Lieberman said the outcome reflected the voters' desire for
change and ``a desire for an advocate for the state, which of course
is what I've been as attorney general _ environment, consumers,
jobs, housing, drugs.''
   Weicker repeatedly stressed that he would not seek the GOP
gubernatorial nomination in 1990 or any other public office,
including a post in the new Bush administration.
   He said he would focus on family and friends and his passion for
sports and marine science, and said he might choose an academic
career.
   Weicker said he had no regrets about his legislative career and
was proud of his accomplishments, especially his fights against
school prayer, anti-busing proposals and other constitutional issues
that ``nobody else would touch with a 10-foot pole'' during the
Reagan years.
   ``Not one word of that Constitution is different today than when
I walked out on the Senate floor'' 18 years ago, he said.
   ``Thank you, Connecticut, for giving me the opportunity that any
other person would dream of. And goodbye.''

<TEXT>
   Residents are gleeful, proud and a
bit apprehensive about what could become of their seaside community
of 4,500 people now that summer resident George Bush has been
elected president.
   ``I think everyone's real excited,'' Kathy Anuszewski said
Wednesday as she worked at The Lobster Port, a shopping center Bush
frequents about a mile from his family compound. ``But no one really
knows what to expect about its effect on the town.''
   Except for during World War II, Bush has spent every summer since
he was a child in this town 25 miles southwest of Portland.
Residents speak of the 64-year-old Bush and his family reverently,
and even those worried about the consequences admit that having the
president nearby is an honor.
   Janet Winters, a Republican member of the town's Board of
Selectmen, said residents are happy for Bush, but said there is
concern about the potential for a rise in tourism. The streets are
already clogged daily between May and September.
   ``I am proud. I'm pleased he'll be here,'' said Gerda Towne, who
owns two stores at the Port. ``But the merchants have got to be sure
the town doesn't go to pot. We don't want any honky tonks.''
   Ocean Avenue, the winding, narrow road where the Bush family
lives, is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare at
the Bush compound. Many locals say they fear those crowds will grow.
   ``I'm a little leery because I don't know what costs the town
will incur,'' Winters said. ``Every bus tour that comes into
southern Maine will swing into town. But still, there's a sense of
pride in him, a feeling it's our town that could be the center of
attention.''
   Republican friends of Bush have hired a local artist to paint a
36-foot banner to hang across Dock Square when the Bushes return to
town.
   ``Welcome Home,'' the banner says. ``George Our President And
Barbara Our First Lady, Our Hopes And Prayers Are With You.''
   Secret Service agents already have met with town officials to
discuss the precautions that must be undertaken now that Bush will
be president, Duncan said. What changes will take place are still
unclear, however, and town police have yet to meet with the Secret
Service.
   ``We just don't know what to expect,'' Town Manager Jane Duncan
said. ``Rumors are running rampant.''
   Police Chief John Prescott said he hopes to meet with Secret
Service officials by the end of the week.
   One security-related worry concerns the lobstermen who pull their
traps from waters around the Bush compound during warm weather.
There has been speculation the fishermen will be ordered away.
   Bush has said he would forgo Kennebunkport if it means others
will suffer. Statements like that have generated affection for the
president-elect.
   ``He's just a real nice guy, a down to earth guy,'' Anuszewski
said.
   ``My dad has known George Bush a long time, and he plays golf
with him,'' she said. ``We're all really proud of him, but he's
still the same guy was before.''

   Police rushed out 400 officers today to investigate
a series of attacks in a residential zone east of Tokyo in which six
children as young as age 2 have been stabbed in the stomach.
   Kaichi Sato of the Chiba Prefectural Police said a police
helicopter was also flown over residential areas 21 miles east of
Tokyo to broadcast warnings to children not to walk alone on city
streets.
   The stepped-up police effort came after a two-year-old boy was
stabbed by a man with a sharp object while playing alone on a street
in front of his house Wednesday.
   An hour later, another 3-year-old boy was also stabbed by an
unknown assailant while playing alone about two miles away, Sato
said.
   Known for its relatively low crime rate, Japan had 1,291 cases of
reported crime per 100,000 people last year, compared to 5,480 cases
in the United States, figures from the National Police Agency show.
   ``Those attacked were all young children. ... Their description
of an assailant was so vague,'' Sato said.
   He said at least four similar cases were reported in a nearby
town and cities in neighboring Saitama Prefecture, just north of
Tokyo, since last month. In each case, children were stabbed in the
stomach while playing alone, police said.
   Crimes against children in Japan, while rare, have grabbed
headlines whenever such incidents occur.
   In one such case in September 1987, the body of a 5-year-old boy
was found naked in a river bed two days after he was kidnapped and
an anonymous telephone caller demanded $161,000 ransom. The case
remains unsolved.

<HEAD>17 Prisoners Injured in Calif. Jail Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL CAJON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jail riot sparked by racial tensions
between blacks and Hispanics who were crammed into a cell block six
times too small left 17 prisoners injured, one critically,
authorities said.
   About 150 men in a cell block designed to hold 24 fought with
each other for 20 minutes Wednesday night with weapons made from mop
handles, window shards, disassembled bunk beds and sharpened plastic
spoons, Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Liz Foster said.
   ``We had darn near everybody in the cell block fighting at one
point,'' said Benny McLaughlin, commander of the El Cajon Detention
Facility. ``They just got tired out and after 20 minutes of
fighting, they started looking for cover.''
   Deputies inside the jail do not carry guns, so they had to wait
until the inmates quit fighting before they could enter the cell
block and restore order, McLaughlin said.
   The two most seriously injured prisoners were flown to University
of California-San Diego Medical Center. One was in critical
condition with head injuries suffered in a 14-foot fall from the
cell block's upper tier to the concrete floor.
   The other was in serious but stable condition with a stab wound
to the neck. Neither of their identities was immediately available.
   Seven other prisoners were injured seriously, but the nature of
their injuries wasn't immediately available, officials said. No
guards were injured, Foster said.
   The fight began when inmates were watching television and milling
around outside their seventh-floor cells during a recreation period,
McLaughlin said.
   Each of the 45-square-foot cells in the block houses an average
of nine inmates, so they have been allowed to gather in a common
recreation area until 10 p.m. each night, McLaughlin said.
   It was the third apparently racially motivated brawl between
blacks and Hispanics at the San Diego County jail in the past five
months, McLaughlin said.
   The jail was designed for 120 inmates, but usually houses more
than 700 because of a countywide shortage of jail space and a
court-imposed inmate cap at the central jail in downtown San Diego.
   ``We're going to be moving some bodies around to different jails
tonight,'' sheriff's dispatcher Kathy Wilder said.

   A Chinese seismologist estimated today that more
than 1,000 people were killed in the earthquake that struck a
heavily forested and remote mountain region of southwestern China
last weekend.
   Rescue workers, meanwhile, were reported still trying to reach
isolated areas that may have been badly hit by China's worst
earthquake in 12 years.
   Chen Yong, deputy director of the State Seismological Bureau,
provided the official Xinhua News Agency with the death estimate.
   The agency also quoted him as saying more than 80 percent of the
houses in the stricken area near China's border with Burma had
collapsed.
   Chen said most of the houses in the region, inhabited mainly by
ethnic minority groups, were made of bamboo and wood.
   Earlier, the Civil Affairs Ministry said 938 people were killed
in Sunday's temblor, which measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.
   Xinhua said 699 bodies had been recovered in the Lancang area of
southern Yunnan province, at the epicenter. State-run Beijing Radio
reported 1,986 people injured.
   But the extent of the disaster remained unclear because of the
remoteness of the region and heavy damage to communications and
transportation links.
   Yunnan provincial official Li Weijin said today that rescue
workers were still trying to reach isolated mountain pockets where
people may have been hurt or killed.
   Seismologist Chen based his casualty estimate on the geographic
conditions of the stricken area and comparisons with other
catastrophic quakes, including a 1976 quake that killed 242,000 in
the northeast China city of Tangshan.
   Beijing Radio on Wednesday said rescue teams were being forced to
trek on foot through heavily forested mountain terrain to reach some
villages. The village of Zhanmapo, believed the worst hit with 297
dead, was accessible only by a footpath that was blocked by a
landslide.
   The Richter scale records ground motion in an earthquake as
measured by seismographs. A tremor of 6.0 is capable of causing
considerable destruction in a populated area and a quake measuring
7.0 is 10 times as powerful.
   Sunday's quake of 7.6 was the most deadly since the 1976 Tangshan
tremor, which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. As of Wednesday
morning there had been 184 aftershocks, and Chen said aftershocks
would continue for about two months.

Court here early next week as part of the out-of-court settlement
reached Wednesday.
   ``This means the farmers are going to get 100 cents on the dollar
and not have to pay any attorney fees,'' said Stanley Chesley, the
lead attorney in the class-action suit.
   Chesley said the interest on the deposited money also would go to
the farmers. U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin has said that hearings
may be held in the 10 states for farmers who want to be heard
further.
   The final agreement will be submitted to Rubin, who had suggested
the two sides seek an agreement.
   Chubb said in a statement it decided to settle for several
reasons. It said that in October, when the case was being prepared
for trial, there was evidence ``which substantially affected Chubb's
ability to pursue the defense of this litigation.''
   Chubb said that evidence included testimony of witnesses
indicating that officials of Good Weather International, which
served as agents in selling the insurance, ``had acted contrary to
Chubb's specific instructions in several material respects. This
newly discovered evidence dictated that Chubb pursue a settlement
rather than protracted and costly litigation.''
   Officials of Jericho, N.Y.-based Good Weather International
declined to comment until they had seen a copy of Chubb's statement
and the settlement, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Chesley said he will ask that Chubb's records for the drought
insurance be audited and that the court appoint a master to invest
and pay out the money.
   The lawsuit was scheduled for trial Jan. 3 before Rubin.
   The farmers alleged that Chubb, based in Warren, N.J., unfairly
denied them insurance against crop damage caused by this year's
severe drought.
   Chubb began rejecting payments in the middle of the year when it
said that brokers sold more coverage than planned. Chubb lawyers
said the company was prepared to sell about $40 million in coverage,
but brokers had sold more than $300 million.
   Chubb said the $48 million should be enough to cover anticipated
payments to farmers who didn't receive policies, as well as
expenses, attorneys' fees and other distributions determined by
Rubin.
   The farmers will receive amounts equal to the losses that would
have been covered if they had been policy holders, minus what the
premiums would have cost and any goodwill payments already made to
them by Chubb, the company said.
   Chubb spokeswoman Gail Devlin said last week that the company had
made $11 million in goodwill payments to drought insurance
applicants and planned no additional payments.
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of farmers in Ohio, Kentucky,
Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa
and Wisconsin.

   Students will regain extracurricular
activities and a previously forfeited basketball season could be
salvaged because voters approved a property tax levy that had failed
in six previous elections.
   Residents of this village 10 miles south of Youngstown voted
1,791-1,627 on Tuesday to approve a five-year emergency operating
levy that was the largest of the 233 school tax issues on Ohio
ballots.
   ``More people came out (to vote) and I know some people
switched,'' said school Superintendent Roger Stiller. ``I think they
realized that not only was our school district in trouble, but that
a lot of other districts were in trouble.
   ``It's back to picking up the pieces, but we're glad to be
picking them up,'' Stiller said.
   James Meissner, who coached the Columbiana High School boys'
basketball team until athletics were canceled this year, said former
players asked him whether the 350-student school could have a team
this year.
   ``That was their first question after the vote,'' Meissner said.
   ``Winter sports _ boys' and girls' basketball and wrestling _
depends on numbers of players and ... whether we can get enough
games to have a meaningful season,'' he said. The coach said the
school gave up its league schedule after a levy proposal failed in
August. It was the sixth straight failure of a tax proposal.
   Students said they were left with little to do after a budget
deficit projected at $425,000 this year forced officials to cut all
extracurricular activities and some elective classes.
   Players from Columbiana's former league champion football team
transferred this year to neighboring districts so they could
continue playing, Stiller said. One student left recently so he
could play basketball in a neighboring district.
   The new Columbiana levy, which starts in January, is expected to
raise $875,000 a year, Stiller said. New revenues in the remainder
of the school year will be used to repay $215,000 the district
borrowed from banks and the state to cover this semester's shortfall.

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key prosecution witness in the
trial of an accused mercy killer admitted his role in the death of
his terminally ill stepsister and said his family's efforts to kill
her were ``acts of love.''
   Russell Delman, who was granted immunity from prosecution before
his role in Patricia Rosier's death was known, testified Wednesday
that he joined her husband in acts leading to her death on Jan. 15,
1986, at the age of 43.
   Fort Myers pathologist Robert Peter Rosier, 47, is on trial for
first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit
murder in the death of his wife, who was already dying from cancer
of the lungs, brain and adrenal glands.
   Delman said it was his layman's opinion that the family's acts
were illegal but described them as ``acts of love'' for Mrs. Rosier.
   Defense attorney Stanley Rosenblatt asked the Kentfield, Calif.,
man if he thought it was fair for him, his brother Farrell and
father Vincent to walk free with immunity while Rosier is on trial.
   ``I don't think it's fair for anyone to be on trial for this
case,'' Delman testified, adding that he didn't want to see his
brother-in-law go to jail.
   Rosier was indicted 11 months after his wife's death when he said
in a television interview that he ``administered something to
terminate her life'' and wrote a book about how she died.
   He is accused of providing his wife with 20 tablets of the
sedative Seconal and administering morphine injections and
suppositories. Most of her relatives knew she planned to commit
suicide and wanted to die at home peacefully, Delman testified.
   But Mrs. Rosier survived through the night of Jan. 14 after the
drugs were administered, Delman said.
   ``If I had the guts, I'd put a pillow over her face,'' Delman
said he told Rosier, his father and brother as they waited outside
her bedroom early in the morning of Jan. 15.
   Rosier then said, ``I don't want to hear about the end,'' Delman
testified.
   Delman testified that his father, a semi-retired New York City
dentist, took matters in his own hands and smothered her by placing
his hands over her nose and mouth. She died 10 minutes later, Delman
said.
   Delman told the jury he would have lied about his father's part
if they hadn't been given immunity.
   But Assistant State Attorney Ed Volz questioned why Rosier had
called Vincent Delman after the television interview to warn him of
possibile liability if Rosier didn't know he had smothered his wife.

<HEAD>Severe Storms Hit Middle Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled through the middle Mississippi Valley today
after storms brought winds that overturned a mobile home in
Arkansas, hail and rain to Oklahoma and Texas, and a ``dust devil''
of a tornado in Kansas.
   The thunderstorms developed Wednesday afternoon along a cold
front from west central Missouri to southeast Kansas and central
Oklahoma.
   The line of thunderstorms produced a tornado near Pittsburg, Kan.
Two residents of the southeastern Kansas community were treated for
minor injuries.
   The twister looked ``like a dust devil made of water and
leaves,'' said Sam Hubbard of Pittsburg, who drove his car through
the storm.
   Elsewhere in Kansas, strong thunderstorm winds blew down
telephone poles at Edna.
   In Oklahoma, the storms were accompanied by hail and strong,
gusty winds. The southeasterly areas of McAlester, Wilburton,
Talihina, and Hartshorne were hit by golf ball-sized hail Wednesday
evening.
   The thunderstorms produced severe weather as the cold front
tracked into Arkansas. More storms developed as the front moved into
northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana.
   In Arkansas, strong thunderstorm winds downed trees and power
lines at Nashville in the southwestern part of the state. One person
was injured when winds overturned a mobile home in Garland County in
southern Arkansas late Wednesday.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain over the Great Lakes
and the northern Atlantic coast states; snow over upper Michigan;
showers and thunderstorms from the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic
States to the central Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi Valley;
widespread rain across the Pacific Northwest; snow over the
mountains of northern California, Oregon and Washington; and fair
weather in the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s over North Dakota,
northeastern South Dakota, the upper Mississippi Valley and upper
Michigan; the 40s and 50s from the central and northern Pacific
coast to the northern and central Rockies, the central Plains, the
middle Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley to
northern New England; the 80s over southeast and south central
Texas, the Gulf Coast and Florida; the 90s over southern Texas; and
the 60s through the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 79 degrees at the Naval Air
Station at Corpus Christi, Texas.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake shook a wide
section of northern California, knocking items off grocery shelves
but causing no injuries or major damage.
   The quake Wednesday night had a magnitude of 4.7 on Richter
scale, according to the University of California at Berkeley
Seismographic Stations. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park
gave a preliminary reading of 4.5, with an epicenter 11 miles
northeast of San Jose on the Calaveras Fault.
   Most who felt the quake described it as two sharp jolts, but said
it was not frightening.
   At the Alpha Beta supermarket in San Jose, kitchen items, jar
lids and a can fell off the shelves, said clerk Mike Depiro.
   ``It was shaking, rattling and rumbling,'' he said. ``I was
bagging groceries and I heard things start rumbling and falling, so
I paid attention. I just enjoyed it.''
   The 9:08 p.m. temblor occurred at about the same location as did
a magnitude 5.0 quake June 12. That quake caused slight damage.
   Wednesday's quake was felt in an area stretching at least 200
miles to the north of San Francisco in Eureka, 120 miles to the
south in Seaside in Monterey County, and 120 miles to the east in
Modesto.
   Police in San Francisco, San Jose and several other Bay area
communities reported dozens of phone calls about the temblor, but
none received reports of structural damage or injuries.
   The Richter scale is used to describe the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Each increase of one number on the scale means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause
moderate damage, while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage.

   Police said a woman whose daughters told
them she died after being beaten by two thugs attempting to take $11
she planned to spend on Christmas gifts was not attacked and
actually died of a heart attack.
   Fairfield police said Wednesday that their investigation found
that Shirley Lockett, 47, of Birmingham received a head injury
Saturday during an argument with a man she had been dating, not in
the parking lot of a Fairfield store as her daughters reported
Monday.
   ``The story is not true,'' Fairfield police Sgt. Jack Woods said.
``I'm not sure if the mother told the story to her daughters or if
the daughters made it up, but it is not true.''
   Mrs. Lockett was hospitalized after a man she had been dating for
about two years hit her, Woods said. Mrs. Lockett apparently fell
during the scuffle at a motel and hit her head on a bed, he said.
   Mrs. Lockett was admitted to a hospital for treatment of the head
injury. She died of an unrelated heart attack Monday afternoon,
Woods said.
   Woods said the boyfriend would not be charged.
   Mrs. Lockett's daughters, Sharon Lockett, 22, and Marcella Agee,
26, said Monday their mother told them she was beaten by two men at
a department store parking lot.
   Sharon Lockett said her mother told her the men tried
unsuccessfully to take her purse before they were chased away by
bystanders.

   The army opened fire and killed at 15
people when thousands of anti-government demonstrators defied
curfews today in three towns in the Sinhalese heartland, police said.
   Thirty others were injured, Colombo police said.
   A military spokesman in Colombo confirmed soldiers had ``taken
action'' against violent demonstrations, but he said he did not know
how many people were killed or injured. He spoke on condition of
anonymity in keeping with regulations.
   In Colombo, heavily armed security troops stood guard as three
people formally declared their candidacy for president of this
island wracked by war and crippled by civil unrest and strikes.
   No demonstrations were reported in Colombo.
   But in the Tangalle, Tissmaharama and Monaragala districts south
and east of Colombo, demonstrators defied around-the-clock curfews,
police in Colombo said. At least five people were killed in each of
the districts, they said.
   Security troops on Wednesday were issued shoot-on-sight orders in
case of demonstrations against the government, state radio said.
   In Colombo, soldiers in armored cars blocked roads leading to the
town hall as nomination papers were presented for the Dec. 19
presidential election. About 1,000 police with automatic weapons
watched as election commissioner Chanchrananda de Silva accepted the
documents.
   The candidates are former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike,
leader of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Prime Minister
Ramasinghe Premadasa, candidate of the ruling United National Party,
and Ossie Abeygoonesekera, representing the three-party United
Socialist Alliance.
   President Junius R. Jayewardene, who has governed since 1977, is
prohibited by law from seeking another term and has said he will
step down after a successor is sworn in.
   But a Sinhalese extremist group is demanding he resign before the
elections, charging the current government is incapable of
conducting fair elections. The People's Liberation Front wants
parliament dissolved and a caretaker government set up to oversee
the balloting.
   The front pressed its demands on Monday by launching a four-day
strike that shut down businesses throughout much of the island,
resulted in shortages of food and fuel and prompted thousands of
foreign tourists to cut short vacations.
   The front opposes the government's peace overtures to end a
5-year Tamil insurgency that has claimed more than 8,500 lives. The
government blames the front for the deaths of more than 550 people,
most of them Sinhalese supporters of the government.
   The front says Jayewardene, who is Sinhalese, has offered too
many concessions to the Tamil ethnic minority.
   Most Sinhalese are Buddhists, while most Tamils are Hindus.
   This week's strike has closed most shops and banks. Prices for
some food, mostly fruit and vegetables, have skyrocketed as much as
300 percent.
   Troops have been posted throughout the capital. Soldiers have
been driving public buses and distributing fuel to state gasoline
stations where motorists wait up to five hours in line. And the navy
moved into Colombo port after dock workers refused to report for
duty.
   On Wednesday, the government declared power, water and health
services, ports, communications, railroads, public transport and
radio and television essential services subject to emergency law.
   It said employees who refused to return to work would be fired.
   Despite the warning, more than 70 percent of the employees failed
to show up for their shifts, officials said.
   Security forces received orders Wednesday to shoot anyone
demonstrating against the government. No such demonstrations were
reported. Nighttime curfews were imposed.
   The strike also disrupted the island's tourist industry, which
this year reported an increase for the first time since ethnic
violence flared in 1983.
   About 9,000 tourists were evacuated Tuesday from the south coast,
where most resorts are located, after the front told the hotels to
close or face attacks.
   Special charter flights left Wednesday with about 3,000 tourists
from West Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia and more flights were
planned, tour operators said.
   Asker Moosajee, chairman of the state Ceylon Tourist Board, said
the government had advised foreign tour groups the country was
facing shortages and unsettled political conditions.
   ``We have not told foreigners to leave the country, but if people
are scared, there's not much we can do,'' he said. ``We have advised
tour groups that curfews and shortages may make the packages they
are offering below standard.''

<HEAD>Woman Awarded $3 Million In Parole Board Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court has awarded $3 million to a woman
who was shot and paralyzed from the neck down by a paroled inmate,
ruling that the parole board members who voted to free the prisoner
were negligent.
   Linda Grantham, 47, sued the three members of the state Parole
Board that voted to release Clem Jimpson in 1984. Just five weeks
after his release to a halfway house in January 1985, Jimpson shot
Grantham in the parking lot of a Jackson bank.
   Wednesday's verdict by a Circuit Court jury was made possible by
a state Supreme Court ruling last May that Grantham had the right to
sue the board members. Two years earlier, a judge dismissed the
litigation, saying members were immune under state law because they
had acted in their official capacity.
   During the three-day trial that began Monday, District Attorney
Ed Peters testified that a state form asking if Jimpson should be
paroled had arrived after he was freed.
   The jury deliberated five hours before awarding Grantham $2.5
million in actual damages and $500,000 in punitive damages. The suit
had asked for $4 million.
   Grantham, praising the verdict, said that while ``nothing can
replace what I've lost ... if it can change the system, it'll all be
worthwhile.''
   Deputy Attorney General Robert Gibbs called the jurors' decision
``very disappointing.''
   ``They were not to consider whether Jimpson should have been
paroled,'' he said. ``They were to determine whether the Parole
Board was grossly negligent.''
   Gibbs warned the verdict could set a dangerous precedent.
   ``Any agency, any employer, anybody who works for the state of
Mississippi will be affected,'' he said. ``If they make any
decision, they will have to pay for it.''
   Exactly who would pay the damages remains uncertain.
   Gibbs said that if the state loses on appeal, he will ask the
Legislature to cover any damages required to be paid individually by
board members James Figgs, Ollie Sykes, and Paul Carter.
   At the time of his parole, Jimpson was serving a life sentence
for the murder of a Jackson convenience store clerk. The 60-year-old
is now serving a sentence of life without parole for shooting
Grantham.

<TEXT>
   A boys' football coach whose
powerhouse team rolled to an undefeated season has been fired for
allowing his players to pile on the points.
   Jim Donnelly was dismissed Wednesday as offensive coordinator for
the Chiefs, a team of boys 10 to 12 years old whose 9-0 record
included such lopsided scores as 32-0, 22-0, 32-8 and 28-8.
   Palm Beach County Youth League rules say that after a 17-point
lead, the winning team has to ease up to keep from demoralizing its
opponents.
   Because most of the Chiefs' points came in the first quarter, the
best players would have had to sit on the bench most of the game,
and Donnelly said that was not fair.
   ``I'm not in favor of running up the score, but I don't see
anything wrong with a shutout,'' he said.
   Donnelly said he was suspended Monday when he refused orders from
league management to allow an opposing team to score 12 points. He
was dismissed two days later.
   Quarterback Michael Healy, 12, who engineers the team's triple
reverses and sophisticated wishbone attack, said he sees nothing
wrong with punishing his opponents.
   ``Football is supposed to be a mean sport,'' he said. ``That's
what the game of football is all about. You shouldn't be punished
because you're good.''

<HEAD>Precious Stone Carving Is Returned From the United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago museum today returned an
ancient stone carving to Thailand more than 20 years after it
disappeared from a temple.
   The carving of a Hindu god arrived aboard a flight from Chicago
and was to be placed at the Phnom Rong temple in the northeastern
province of Buri Ram.
   The carving, ``The Birth of Brahma With Reclining Vishnu on a
Makara,'' disappeared from the temple in the 1960s. It was bought by
a dealer in Bangkok, who sold it to a New York dealer, who sold it
to the Alsdorf Foundation. The foundation donated it to the Art
Institute of Chicago.
   Thailand has sought its return for 15 years, and government
officials held sensitive talks with the art institute this year. The
institute said this week it was donating the 1,000-year-old carving
to Thailand so the restoration of Phnom Rong temple could be
completed.
   The issue took on nationalistic tones when government officials
and the media accused the United States of bullying its friend in
Southeast Asia.
   Earlier this year, virtually all Thai newspapers ran an open
letter calling on Americans to help return the carving.
   Some Thais said the carving had been ``stolen'' by the United
States. However, experts privately concede that many priceless art
objects are smuggled out of the country through the help of corrupt
government officials.

   A good Samaritan who gave a ride to
a bruised and bloodied teen-ager later found out the young man had
only minutes earlier been involved in a car crash that killed the
do-gooder's wife, police said.
   Alfred Gilbert, 72, attended the funeral Wednesday for his wife,
Betty Jean, without knowing who drove the car that killed her four
days earlier.
   On Wednesday, the man Gilbert had helped, Richard Eric Watson,
19, surrendered to police and was charged in the fatality.
   ``It's an incredible coincidence,'' said police Lt. Jim Twiss.
``It's like `Ripley's Believe It Or Not.' This guy was being a nice
guy and gave him a ride not knowing that he killed his wife three
minutes earlier.''
   According to police, Mrs. Gilbert, 69, left in her car Saturday
while her husband tinkered with his car outside their apartment.
   Minutes later, a young man with bruises on his face and blood on
his clothes ran up to Gilbert and said he had been attacked by some
men, police said. Gilbert gave him a ride to his home in nearby
Pompano Beach.
   ``He felt sorry for the guy,'' said Gilbert's son, Alfred Jr. The
injured man offered Gilbert $5 for the ride, but Gilbert refused it,
his son said.
   Gilbert did not learn of his wife's death until an hour after he
returned home.
   Police said the car driven by Watson ran a stop sign and hit Mrs.
Gilbert's car, killing her instantly.
   Watson was charged with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene
of an accident.

   Israeli soldiers opened fire today on
Palestinian protesters who were hurling stones in the occupied Gaza
Strip, and Palestinian doctors said seven teen-agers were wounded.
   The confrontations followed the fatal shooting Wednesday of a
3-year-old Gaza City boy, Osama Mohammed Abu Ganima. Arab reports
say the boy was shot by Israeli troops, but the military said it was
investigating the circumstances.
   During a tour of the Gaza Strip today, southern commander Gen.
Yitzhak Mordechai expressed regret over the toddler's death.
   ``I'm sorry about the death of the child. I urge residents of
areas where there is trouble to keep their children at home and not
in the playgrounds and certainly not in places where youths disturb
order,'' he said on the radio.
   In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, soldiers raided seven
Palestinian homes Wednesday night in the market area of Nablus,
smashing windows, vandalizing furniture and beating up residents,
Palestinian witnesses said.
   The Palestinians said the raid was the third this week. They said
soldiers used ladders to climb through windows and ordered residents
onto the streets to remove barricades from roads and paint over
anti-Israeli grafitti.
   The Hebrew daily Maariv said a number of Palestinians were
detained in the the raids, which it said were aimed at preventing
violence during the meeting in Algiers of the Palestine National
Council. The meeting begins Saturday.
   Today's violent protests broke out in the Gaza Strip refugee
camps of Deir El Balah and Khan Yunis and the village of Adassan,
Palestinian reports said.
   Seven Palestinian teen-agers were hit by army gunfire, including
a 14-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy who were seriously wounded
in the chest in the Khan Yunis camp, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   The army imposed curfews on the areas and the Jabaliya, Nusseirat
and Rafah refugee camps and the Shejayieh neighborhbood of Gaza City
where the toddler was killed. The curfew confined 173,000
Palestinians to their homes.
   The child was shot in the chest Wednesday when an army jeep was
pelted with stones and troops responded with gunfire, an Arab
reporter said. Officials at Gaza's Shifa Hospital said the boy was
dead on arrival.
   Family members said Osama was playing nearby when the shooting
occurred. In the same incident, a 12-year-old Palestinian was shot
in the jaw and a 13-year-old was wounded in the leg, hospital
officials said.
   An army spokesman in Gaza who demanded anonymity confirmed the
death, saying: ``We are questioning troops to see if the death
resulted from army shooting.''
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, public transportation was halted
and shops closed Wednesday in the latest strike against the Israeli
occupation of the territories captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The strike marked the start of the 12th month of uprising that
began Dec. 8. It has claimed the lives of 310 Arabs and 11 Israelis.

   A saddle that belonged to Gen. George A.
Custer was auctioned for $22,000, and it wasn't even the one he was
on during his last stand at the Little Big Horn in 1876.
   ``Nothing was found on the battlefield at the Little Big Horn
that was known to have belonged to Custer,'' Greg Martin, a dealer
in Western artifacts, said at Wednesday's auction. ``He was
completely stripped, possibly scalped, too.''
   The event at Butterfield & Butterfield's auction house drew about
300 collectors of Western Americana and fetched $424,155.
   The auction's main items were those connected with the Little Big
Horn, where Custer, his brother and 265 members of the 7th Cavalry
were massacred by an Indian force estimated as high as 5,000.
   A letter Custer wrote to President Ulysses S. Grant asking
permission to visit him was sold for $52,250.
   A fading extra of the Bismarck Tribune in which the Dakota
Territory newspaper first reported on the July 6, 1876 battle two
weeks earlier sold for $600.
   A photograph of Custer in boots and gauntlets went for $550,
while one of Sitting Bull, the Sioux chief helped prepare Indian
warriors for the fight, sold for $700.

<HEAD>IRA Bombs Soldiers' Married Quarters; Warns Families to Quit
Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army warned
British soldiers today to get their families out of Northern Ireland
or face attacks on their living quarters.
   The warning followed a car bombing Tuesday night that extensively
damaged a military housing complex at Campsie, four miles outside
the north coast city of Londonderry, police said.
   The IRA gave a warning 30 minutes before the blast and the area
was quickly evacuated, but two policemen were treated for shock and
a soldier sustained cuts, police said.
   On Wednesday, in a statement circulated to Irish media, the IRA
took responsibility for the bombing and said: ``We now warn all
military personnel that they must remove their families from the
occupied north of Ireland.''
   Married quarters have not been a target of the IRA in recent
years in the outlawed organization's campaign to rid Northern
Ireland of British rule and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   But the statement said: ``All army housing estates, or similar
identifiable areas, henceforward will be liable to attack.''
   ``No longer can the IRA tolerate the ridiculous situation where
British soldiers can come into nationalist areas, raid and
systematically wreck homes, harass people, make arrests and then
retire just a few miles away to the comfort of their families,'' the
statement said.
   By ``nationalist areas,'' the IRA was referring to Catholic
districts where it draws its support, and which are the focus of
military and police counter-insurgency measures.

   George Bush today begins a long-awaited rest at
the end of a rigorous campaign, but the president-elect says he will
be wielding a telephone as well as a fishing pole during his Florida
vacation as he considers the makeup of his administration.
   After announcing Wednesday that he will appoint his campaign
manager, former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, as his
secretary of state, the vice president said he intends to divulge
``within a couple of weeks'' the other members of his cabinet.
   In Houston, where he spent election night, Bush told a news
conference he was choosing Baker, his campaign chairman and longtime
friend, to succeed Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   The president-elect also appointed his chief of staff, Craig
Fuller, and campaign pollster and strategist Robert Teeter to head a
transition team.
   Bush said he would name his cabinet ``fairly soon, but certainly
not before I come back from Florida'' on Monday. ``I'll be thinking
about it. I'll be trying to sort that out. Probably have a series of
announcements within a couple of weeks.''
   Bush plans to do some fishing at Delray Beach, Fla., and added,
``I just want to relax and get on the telephone.''
   On the first day after his presidential victory over Democrat
Michael Dukakis, Bush began the day with Episcopalian church
services, and later said, ``That is probably the first moment when I
realized the enormity of it all.''
   The president-elect received congratulatory messages from Soviet
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other world leaders, and
spoke by telephone to well-wishers from both sides of the political
fence.
   Bush also was welcomed home to Washington by thousands of
supporters and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, who he predicted
will be ``one of the great vice presidents.''
   Quayle and Bush, joined by their wives, traveled to the White
House to meet with President Reagan who paid tribute to Bush,
saying, ``to those who sometimes flatter me with talk of a Reagan
revolution, today, my hope is this: You ain't seen nothin' yet.''
   At his Houston news conference, Bush said his reaction to his
victory was ``somewhere between total exhilaration and recognition
that the challenge ahead is going to be awesome. ... There's a
seriousness that takes over right this minute.''
   Bush told the several thousand people who gathered to greet him
at an airplane hangar at Andrews Air Force Base, ``I have a sense of
blooming. I have a sense of spring ... a wonderful new era, rich
with possibility and full of hope.''
   He also said he had received a warm message from Gorbachev and
had sent a message back so that ``we can keep this new bilateral
relationship moving ahead.''
   He said he does not plan to jump in too early to succeed Reagan,
whom he called ``one of the great heroes of the modern era.''
   ``President Reagan is still the president of the United States
and I will not be using the transition to try to make or unduly
influence decisions that are properly the president's,'' Bush said.
   In the aftermath of a campaign that saw Congress-bashing as a
regular part of the Bush stump speech, the president-elect said he
wants to put the heat of the campaign behind him and mend fences
with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   ``I don't want us to talk at each other. I want to talk to each
other,'' he said.
   The vice president said he had received congratulatory calls from
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and from Sen. Sam Nunn, the
Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

   With candles, prayers and a pealing of church bells, Americans
marked the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the ``night of broken
glass'' that shattered lives and illusions as it ushered in the Nazi
Holocaust.
   Synagogues, churches and schools in New York, Los Angeles, Miami,
Montgomery, Ala., and other cities on Wednesday commemorated the
Nazi riots of Nov. 9, 1938, when scores of Jews were killed and more
than 1,100 synagogues set afire. The anniversary also was marked in
cities in Europe.
   ``We knew that what was happening in Germany then was a turning
point in anti-Semitism,'' Holocaust author and Nobel laureate Elie
Wiesel, a concentration camp survivor, said today on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   ``People didn't ignore it, governments did. People knew of the
suffering. ... It was wrong. We could have saved all German Jews.
With 50,000 visas we would have saved every single man, woman and
child of Jewish faith. But somehow nothing was done.''
   ``We all had before the Holocaust the hope of betterment of
man,'' Rabbi Gerald Teller told about 100 people at Ezra Habonim
Synagogue in Chicago on Wednesday. ``This day is one of reflection
on a day of broken glass and shattered dreams.''
   In New York City, Cardinal John O'Connor told nearly 1,000 people
who attended a service at St. Patrick's Cathedral about the candle
burning in the window of his residence.
   ``I light that candle to tell anyone in New York (who) out of
hatred of Jews wants to shatter glass or paint swastikas _ shatter
the glass of my house, paint the swastikas on my house, for a
spiritual Semite lives therein,'' he said.
   Fifty years ago Wednesday, Adolf Hitler's top aide, Josef
Goebbels, ordered Nazi thugs to attack Jewish homes, businesses and
temples after a German diplomat was slain in Paris.
   The Nazis gave the night its name, German for ``crystal night,''
because shards of broken glass littered the streets. Many historians
believe it marked the start of the Nazi campaign to wipe out
European Jews.
   Gretel Oppenheimer of Chicago remembers finding her dog dead on
the doorstep of her Stuttgart home, shot by Nazis.
   ``For me, it's impossible to think Kristallnacht happened half a
century ago,'' said Ms. Oppenheimer, 80. ``Every day since, I've
lived like it was only last night.''
   Ms. Oppenheimer agreed that the night could have been called one
of shattered illusions.
   ``My twin brother had already emigrated to America, as I wanted
to,'' she said. ``But right up to '38 my father kept saying: `It
will pass. Don't worry. These Nazi thugs are not the real Germany.'
''
   New Yorker Fannie Joelson, a survivor who never saw her father
and husband again after they were taken away by storm troopers on
Kristallnacht, said the memories were ``very painful for us.''
   ``We saw too much, we hurt too much. We do not want to
remember,'' she said. ``But we do remember. How can we forget?''
   Those who did not suffer through Kristallnacht must not forget
either, said former U.S. Ambassador to Austria Ronald Lauder,
chairman of the Kristallnacht Remembrance Committee.
   ``We must remain vigilant and not allow even the smallest seed of
anti-Semitism to take root,'' Lauder told the audience at St.
Patrick's.
   In Miami, the Rev. James Fetscher of St. Louis Church stood side
by side with Rabbi David Auerbach of Bet Shira Congregation at an
inter-faith ceremony. Fetscher prayed for ``living memories so we
can never forget.''
   The congregations have grown close since Bet Shira was desecrated
Feb. 28. Fifty windows were smashed and words such as ``Die Jew''
were spray painted on the walls.
   Members of St. Louis Church, three blocks away, responded by
putting a blue Star of David in front of their building.
   At Wilshire Boulevard Temple, Los Angeles' oldest synagogue, a
commemorative program featured keynote speaker Angus Thuermer, an
Associated Press reporter stationed in Berlin during Kristallnacht.
   ``I was absolutely astonished then and I am astonished today. We
have not paid attention enough to its significance,'' Thuermer said.
   Synagogues in 12 cities, presented the premiere of an oratorio
``Stars in the Dust,'' which ``describes the disintegration of
German society into a society that attacked its own population,''
said Cantor Eliot Vogel, who participated in a performance of the
work at Congregation Beth El of South Orange, N.J.
   Other cities included Atlanta, Baltimore, Des Moines, St. Louis,
Philadelphia and Houston, he said.
   In Montgomery, Ala., the Jewish community held a candlelight
service on the steps of the Capitol at which a proclamation issued
by Gov. Guy Hunt was read.
   Former Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson, whose
reference to New York City as ``Hymietown'' during his 1984 campaign
strained relations between blacks and Jews, called for a healing
between the two groups as he joined in a ceremony in Washington.
   The anniversary ``gives us a unique opportunity to share together
and come together,'' said Jackson. ``We must get beyond
anti-Semitism, beyond racism.''

   The maker of an electronic hair-removal system
made false and misleading claims that the device could permanently
eliminate unwanted hair, the Federal Trade Commission ruled.
   The decision, made public Wednesday, upholds a 1987
administrative law judge's ruling against Removatron International
Corp.
   The commission issued an order prohibiting the company from
making false and misleading claims, requiring it to inform past
purchasers of the product about the ruling and ordering it to place
labels on its products stating that it has no proof that its
machines produce anything other than temporary hair removal.
   The company sells devices, called Removatron, that use tweezers
to remove hairs, while at the same time transmitting radio waves to
the hair roots. It has claimed that this process eventually destroys
the hair root tissue and prevents future growth.
   The machines, which cost about $4,000 each, are sold to beauty
salons and other businesses, which offer hair-removal service to
customers.
   Under terms of the order the company must halt its claims unless
it can produce ``competent and reliable scientific'' evidence that
the machines will work.

   Scientists won't be able to move into a new $23
million government laboratory until at least next year because of
problems with a ventilation system designed to keep deadly viruses
from escaping, officials said.
   ``They want to be sure before they clear a system like that for
people like me to crawl under a hood and begin working with a hot
virus,'' said Dr. Thomas Fowlkes, director of the Centers for
Disease Control's retrovirus laboratory.
   Viruses that will be studied at the lab include those causing
AIDS and Lassa Fever, which has been responsible for epidemics of
hemorrhagic fever in Nigeria.
   Ribbon cutting at the building was last month, but the
ventilation-system problems have delayed occupancy by an estimated
80 researchers, officials said.
   The ventilation system is designed to keep air pressure inside
the building's 12 laboratories slightly below normal so that air
from the hallways always flows into the labs to keep microbes from
being carried out.
   Steve White, the CDC engineer responsible for operating the air
system, said the problems involve the 96 pneumatic control units
whose delicate sensors and valves measure and adjust air pressure
throughout the building.
   For unknown reasons, changes in air pressure, such as those
caused by an open door, throw the gauges out of adjustment.

<HEAD>Court Suspends License Of Pilot Who Flew Low Over Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted two years ago for landing a small
plane on the Champs Elysees had his pilot's license suspended today
for three years for flying 1,000 feet over Paris on a bet.
   Albert Maltret also was fined $8,300 for violating civil aviation
regulations for a low pass he made over the Champs Elysees on Oct.
13.
   Maltret's attorney Jean Yves Lienart denied his 52-year-old
client is the ``Black Baron,'' a pilot who for months evaded French
police while making midnight flights over Paris rooftops. French
newspapers had speculated that Maltret was the elusive pilot.
   Maltret told the court he had been a pilot for 31 years and a
flight instructor for 24 years in France, Morocco, Libya, Bangladesh
and Gabon.
   ``I just love aviation so much that I could not resist a bet
proposed to me by some friends,'' he said in his own defense.
   Jean Zamponi, president of the court, responded: ``Monsieur
Maltret, do you believe that a 52-year-old man should behave like a
man of 20 and not resist a bet of this type?''
   Lienart compared his client's stunt to Grand Prix driver Alain
Prost racing on an empty public street, saying: ``It was a violation
of the rules, but it was not a danger.''
   Maltret said he had made contingency plans in the event of
trouble during the flight that included landing his rented Rallye MS
880 Morane-Saulnier aircraft on the Seine River. He told the court
he was sorry and promised never again to perform such a stunt.
   The Air and Border Police arrested Maltret Oct. 13 shortly after
his afternoon landing at a private airfield in the Paris suburb of
St. Cyr.
   Lienart argued that his client should not be punished for the
publicity surrounding the unexplained summer flights. He pointed out
that Maltret flew during daylight hours in an identifiable plane,
``while the Black Baron is night, discretion, mystery.''
   The summer flights captured the imagination of the French public
and the media dubbed the pilot the ``Black Baron'' in a twist on the
nickname of Germany's World War I flying ace, the Red Baron. On the
night of Aug. 13, police helicopters chased the plane but were
unable to catch it.
   Maltret said he was proud of his 1986 escapade in which he landed
his small plane on ``the most beautiful boulevard in the world.''
   Maltret had his pilots license suspended for the Champs Elysees
landing. An amnesty covering minor offenses, enacted this summer as
is traditional after French presidential elections, had allowed
Maltret to recover his license.

<TEXT>
   In the ashes of a lost Democratic presidential
campaign, Jesse Jackson heads toward the next one strengthened by
new rules and a new role.
   Next time, Jackson will begin as the Democrat to beat _ which is
what somebody almost certainly will do. The odds weigh heavily
against the nomination of a black man in 1992, in a party that at
times shrank from the word ``liberal'' during the campaign just
ended.
   Jackson said he doesn't fear that a liberal can't be elected.
``Reaching out, making room, that's liberalism. So the liberal
tradition is a proud tradition,'' he said. ``I will not forsake it.''
   There surely will be ample competition, with Democratic names
like Bradley, Cuomo, Nunn, Gore and Gephardt and more on the early
list of possible entries for 1992. Even as Gov. Michael Dukakis
conceded his loss to President-elect Bush his supporters were
chanting ``ninety-two, ninety-two.''
   Whatever the field, the standing Jackson won in 1988 and the
rules concessions he gained from Dukakis at the Democratic National
Convention will make him more formidable next time. For a while,
Republicans tried to bill him as a virtual third partner in the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. He was a major, nationally-televised
performer at the Atlanta convention.
   Jackson is aware of the perils as well as its advantages of his
enhanced political station. He's been talking with friends and
advisers about the way to deal with both.
   The first step already has been taken. It was a late campaign
sprint in behalf of Dukakis. With it, Jackson guarded against any
finger-pointing suggesting that he'd done less than his best for the
Democratic ticket.
   He said he'd put in more miles, registered more voters than
anyone else in support of Dukakis. By election night his voice was
hoarse and fading from the campaign strain as he said it was much
too early to talk about 1992 politics.
   ``I have not yet made that decision, not even given it serious
consideration,'' he said. That at least is the public posture.
   Jackson also said the new political season began on Wednesday,
pointing to city elections in 1989, off-year elections in 1990, the
census and congressional reapportionment in 1991. ``There's a lot to
do, a lot of meaningful work, and I intend to be involved, right in
the heart of it,'' said Jackson.
   That involvement flows inexorably toward a third quest for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. Jackson's voter
registration efforts for the Dukakis ticket will pay him dividends,
too. His political action committee, Keep Hope Alive, fits the same
pattern.
   An initial test of his strength in party councils will come early
next winter, when the Democratic National Committee elects a new
chairman, or extends the tenure of Paul Kirk, who had planned to
leave the post but may stay on temporarily for the sake of party
peace.
   Ron Brown, a Washington lawyer, Jackson's convention manager and
a volunteer adviser to Dukakis, expects to seek the chairmanship. At
least four other Democrats are prospective candidates.
   While Jackson isn't saying so yet, he will be at work for Brown.
Jackson allies were named to about a dozen at-large committee seats
as part of a harmony pact with Dukakis at the Democratic convention
in Atlanta. One of the new committeemen: Jesse Jackson Jr.
   More important, delegate selection rules have been amended to
Jackson's potential advantage in 1992. In a convention peacemaking
deal with Jackson, the Dukakis camp agreed to rules that will award
future nominating votes strictly on the basis of proportional
representation of the popular vote.
   In simplest terms, that reduces the convention clout of
officeholders and party leaders who are not pledged to a candidate
in advance, tying the outcome more tightly than ever to the
presidential primaries. Another step in that direction was a cut in
the number of so-called super delegates, Democratic governors,
members of Congress and others who got nominating votes with no
strings and no instructions. That bloc was cut to about 10 percent
of the delegate total.
   In Atlanta, Jackson complained that his delegate strength did not
match his percentage of the primary and caucus vote. The new rules
will change that _ unless the Democratic establishment wants to risk
a major battle with the party's premier black leader by trying to
amend them again.
   In kinder, gentler political times, the defeated nominee of a
party was considered its titular leader until the next campaign, and
Dukakis said Wednesday that he will ``provide whatever leadership I
can'' in the interest of Democratic unity.
   But presidential campaigning has become all but permanent, and
defeated candidates go offstage quickly. The new Democratic cast
will be auditioning before long.
   And Jackson will be looking for a lead role. ``Our charge today
is to learn well the lessons from this campaign and build upon it as
the vision for the next campaign,'' he has said.
   Not lately. He made that observation last summer, at the Atlanta
convention, before the general election campaign for the White House
even began.

   The Soviet ambassador to China said today that a
summit next year between the nations' leaders will not dramatically
change Soviet-Chinese relations because they already are normal.
   Oleg Troyanovsky, speaking to the Foreign Correspondents Club of
Beijing, said Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will go to Moscow
on Dec. 1 to set the stage for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30
years.
   ``China and the Soviet Union have entered an important new phase
in their relations,'' he said of the long-time adversaries. ``One
can say ... that our relations with China are normal. So perhaps it
would be more correct to speak not about normalization but about
further development.''
   China split with the Soviet Union over ideological differences in
1960 and fought a brief border war with the Soviets in 1969.
   Troyanovsky echoed Chinese statements that the end of feuding
between the two countries will not mean a return to the relationship
of the 1950s, when Moscow dominated the communist world.
   Soviet-Chinese trade and other non-official contacts have
increased since the early 1980s, but China says normal political
ties depend on the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, a reduction
of Soviet troops on the Chinese border and an end to Soviet support
for Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng, speaking to reporters today before
departing for a trip to Thailand, said, ``If everything goes
smoothly, it is likely that the summit will be held in the first
half of next year.''
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is expected to come to China
because China's senior leader, 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, rarely
travels abroad. Troyanovsky said they had not yet discussed the
summit site.
   It will be the first China-Soviet summit since Nikita Khrushchev
met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959.
   China and the Soviet Union, Troyanovsky said, agree on most
international issues, voting the same way more than 80 percent of
the time at the U.N., far more often than China and the United
States do.
   Troyanovsky said economic reform being carried out in China and
the Soviet Union ``is one of the factors which has brought about an
improvement in the climate of our two nations.''
   Troyanovsky said the Soviet Union regards China as a great power.
``We think China has a great role to play both in regional matters
and world matters,'' he said.

   Shipyard workers who staged a one-day
strike in Gdansk can keep their jobs for now, the yard's management
announced today. State-run media reported earlier that the strikers
had been fired.
   In a statement, management of the Repair Shipyard said dismissals
were unnecessary since strikers heeded an appeal Wednesday to leave
the shipyard.
   It said management will consider the guilt of strike leaders
later and take ``appropriate disciplinary decisions.''
   The state-run news agency PAP announced Wednesday night the
director of the shipyard had fired the instigators of the strike at
the 4,500-worker yard.
   ``In view of the imprecise communique concerning the Gdansk
Repair Shipyard on Polish radio and TV, we would like to inform that
at the appeal of the manager... A small group of strikers left the
enterprise and thus there was no need to submit disciplinary
dismissals immediately ,'' the statement said.
   The management statement, read by Ireneusz Gradowski, editor of
the official shipyard newspaper, Ostrow, said all workers reporting
for work today were allowed into the yard.
   Hundreds of mostly young workers at the Repair and Wisla yards
went on strike Tuesday without the backing of Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa. The workers were demanding that the government scrap its
plan to begin shutting down the Lenin Shipyard next month.
   They ended the strikes Wednesday after repeated appeals from
Walesa and a threat of dismissals from management.
   In September, Walesa persuaded strikers to end Poland's worst
labor unrest in seven years in exchange for a government promise to
hold talks on ending the country's economic and political crisis and
reinstating Solidarity.
   But the talks have been repeatedly delayed, with each side
refusing conditions set by the other. One Solidarity demand is that
about 100 coal miners fired for striking in August be rehired.
   The Wisla and Repair shipyard workers went on strike on a day
Walesa had said he might call a nationwide strike alert over the
government's announced intention to close the 10,000-worker Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk on Dec. 1.
   But no strike alert was issued, and Walesa later said shipyard
managers told him that liquidation of the huge complex would take
several years.
   Soon after hearing Wednesday of the end of the second strike,
Walesa thanked the workers for heeding his request.
   He argued that striking was counterproductive just now and that
attention should be focused on starting the blocked talks with
Communist authorities.
   But he also said: ``We will fight for the shipyard sooner or
later, and we will regain it.''
   Solidarity was born at the Lenin Shipyard, where Walesa works as
an electrician, in August 1980 during nationwide strikes. It was
crushed 15 months later in a military crackdown.
   An undetermined number of workers gave up a strike Wednesday
morning at Wisla Shipyard, which makes yachts and small river craft,
after being promised that those who took part in the strike would
not be fired, the yard's strike leader Jan Stanecki said. He said
several hundred workers supported the strike.
   At the Repair Shipyard, 200 workers who rallied Wednesday morning
ended their strike at around 1 p.m., one hour after management said
they must leave or be fired, said Krzysztof Kamolak, one of the
strike committee members.
   Walesa continues to face resistance from young workers who are
impatient for the proposed talks with the government to begin.
   The talks have also stalled over Walesa's refusal to purge from
Solidarity's proposed delegation two people the government has
deemed extremist, longtime advisers Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron.

<HEAD>Former AG and Watergate Conspirator Mitchell Dies at 75</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 26th graf, Jeb Stuart Magruder, to UPDATE

<TEXT>
   John Newton Mitchell, the gruff former attorney
general who went to prison for conspiring to cover up the Watergate
scandal in his friend Richard Nixon's White House, is dead at 75
after collapsing on a Washington street.
   Mitchell was the highest ranking of the government officials who
served time for the political scandal that brought about Nixon's
resignation from the presidency in August 1974.
   ``I considered John Mitchell to be one of my few close personal
friends,'' Nixon wrote in his memoirs. ``I believed that I owed my
election as president in 1968 largely to his strength as a counselor
and his skill as a manager.''
   An ambulance crew, alerted by a 10-year-old boy who was
skateboarding, found Mitchell unconscious on a street in the
Georgetown section of Washington in early evening Wednesday.
Mitchell had suffered a heart attack.
   He stopped breathing as he was being taken to the hospital, and
died despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Mitchell was convicted on Jan. 1, 1975, of conspiring with
Nixon's chief lieutenants, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and domestic
counselor John D. Ehrlichman, to cover up White House involvement in
the Watergate affair, of the cover-up itself and of perjury. He
fought the conviction in vain to the Supreme Court.
   All three were sentenced after a three-month trial to terms of
2{-to-8 years.
   There was testimony at the Senate Watergate hearings, at the
cover-up trial and in various published first-person accounts that
Mitchell twice rejected plans for spying on Democrats because they
were too expensive but that he accepted a third, less expensive,
version. Mitchell always denied the allegation.
   But in a March 22, 1973, taped Oval Office conversation,
Ehrlichman said ``John says he's sorry he sent those burglars in
there'' to which Nixon replied: ``That's right.''
   Mitchell chimed in at that point and said ``You are very welcome,
sir,'' and the transcript shows laughter.
   The tapes also showed that Nixon once wanted Mitchell to take the
rap for the entire Watergate cover-up. But Mitchell never said a
harsh word about his former New York law partner and would not
permit his defense lawyer to do so. By all accounts they remained
friends.
   ``He was very loyal to the president and the president was not
very loyal to him,'' the late Sen. Sam Ervin, who presided over the
Watergate hearings in the Senate, once said.
   Mitchell was the first former attorney general to be convicted of
a crime. He was disbarred and served a 19-month prison term, which
included five months of medical furloughs.
   When he was done with prison number 24171-157 at the
minimum-security facility at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, he
told reporters, ``Henceforth, don't call me. I'll call you.''
   After his release, Mitchell went into the international
consulting business with Jack Brennan, who was Nixon's chief aide in
the early post-presidential years at San Clemente, Calif.
   ``I never heard him be really cross about any of the things that
happened to him or any of the people who had hurt him, intentionally
or not,'' Brennan said Wednesday. ``He has been, even at my age, my
inspiration and has taught me how to forgive, how to be caring and
how not to hold grudges.''
   As attorney general, Mitchell was known for his credo that ``when
the going gets tough, the tough get going.'' And in Senate testimony
he referred to Watergate as ``White House horrors.''
   The former attorney general's second wife, the flamboyant and
peppery Martha Mitchell, gained a measure of fame for her late-night
telephone calls to reporters in which she offered shrill,
shoot-from-the-hip opinions on controversial issues of all sorts,
including her husband's problems.
   She called reporters in 1973 to announce that she and Mitchell
had split up.
   After he was sentenced for conspiracy, Mitchell said: ``It could
have been a hell of a lot worse. They could have sentenced me to
spend the rest of my life with Martha Mitchell.''
   Mrs. Mitchell died alone in a New York City hospital on May 31,
1976, after suffering from cancer of the bone marrow.
   The two had one daughter, Marti, who lives in Washington.
Mitchell had a son and daughter from his first marriage and there
are five grandchildren. The son, Jack Mitchell Jr., died several
years ago.
   In recent years, the former attorney general had a relationship
with Washington socialite Mary Gore Dean, but Brennan said the two
were not married.
   Brennan said Mitchell paid his way through Fordham Law School by
playing hockey for the New York Rangers. He was highly decorated in
World War II, receiving two purple hearts, and commanded the Navy PT
boat unit in which John F. Kennedy served.
   President Reagan and his wife Nancy issued a statement saying
they were saddened by the death.
   Jeb Stuart Magruder, a Nixon re-election committee official who
served eight months in prison for Watergate crimes, recalled
Mitchell as ``a great mentor and friend of mine and I just loved
that man.''
   Magruder, interviewed today on ``CBS This Morning,'' called
Mitchell ``the most level-headed and positive person in the
administration at that level.'' He said he never knew Mitchell to
utter a word against Nixon after the Watergate scandal brought down
his administration.
   James F. Neal, the chief counsel in the Watergate coverup trial,
called Mitchell ``an easy man to know and associate with.''
   ``He committed offenses, and I prosecuted him,'' Neal said, but
he added, ``There never was any bitterness.''
   Mitchell was a municipal bond specialist and senior partner in
Nixon's old Manhattan law firm when he became chairman of Nixon's
1968 election campaign. He resigned as attorney general to run
Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972, but quit that post as the
Watergate scandal began unfolding.
   Mitchell's release from prison was considered the final page in
the long Watergate saga.
   ``Watergate is now a closed issue,'' said Attorney General
Griffin Bell at the time.

<HEAD>Eight Reported Killed in Brazilian Steelworkers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers and police opened fire on
thousands of striking workers at Brazil's largest steel mill, and a
plant official said today that eight people were killed.
   The confrontation occurred Wednesday night inside the huge
state-owned National Steel Company in Volta Redonda, 80 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Army soldiers occupied the plant Tuesday night after 18,000
steelworkers went on strike demanding higher pay and shorter working
hours.
   The soldiers kept the blast furnaces running, and tanks were
stationed in front of the plant's gates to maintain order.
   On Wednesday, 800 soldiers and police officers tried to disperse
a crowd of 3,000 strikers armed with rocks and iron bars who refused
to leave the plant.
   The troops, who were pelted with stones, fired on the protesters
with tear gas and rifles, said the mill's press official who
demanded anonymity.
   ``We could hear the shots and explosions. We know eight people
were killed and lots were injured, but no one wants to say how they
died,'' said the press official at the plant in a telephone
interview. She said at least two of the victims were steelworkers,
but the others were not immediately identified.
   An officer of the Army's 22nd Motorized Infantry Batallion
confirmed some strikers died from gunshots. ``Some were shot by
soldiers,'' said the officer, who gave his name only as Capt.
Orlando.
   The strikers are demanding a reduction of their work day from
eight to six hours and reinstatement of the cost-of-living
adjustments the government suspended. The average salary of a
steelworker at the Volta Redonda plant is $160 a month, and the
strikers are demanding a 25 percent monthly increase that would be
retroactive 15 months.
   Brazil's annual inflation rate is more than 1,000 percent.
   Strike leaders said they will not negotiate and were awaiting a
ruling on their demands by a court. T
   he strike has crippled the mill's daily output of 26 tons of
steel, costing the government $5 million a day in lost revenue, the
press official said.
   The National Steel Company produces 4 million tons of steel
annually, nearly one-fifth of the nation's total output. Brazil is
Latin America's largest steel producer and ranked seventh worldwide.

   Premier Li Peng of China said today that
all foreign military aid to the warring factions in Cambodia should
end after Vietnam withdraws its troops from that Southeast Asian
nation.
   ``Following the complete withdrawal, military assistance from
foreign countries to all parties in Cambodia ought to cease,'' Li
said.
   China is the key military supplier of a resistance coalition
fighting the Vietnamese and the Hanoi-backed government in Cambodia.
   ``Vietnam must face hard facts and make a solid decision on how
to reconcile with the involved (Cambodian) parties on trying to end
that conflict,'' Li said in a statement shortly after his arrival.
   Li called the decade-long occupation in Cambodia a ``tinderbox''
and said: ``There is widespread agreement to eliminate this
tinderbox swiftly.''
   In Beijing, Li told reporters before leaving that ``China and
Thailand share similar points of view on a political settlement of
the Kampuchean (Cambodian) question. So we would like to exchange
points of views.''
   Li arrived in Thailand today on his first trip outside the
country since taking office in April. He was to discuss the
Cambodian issue with Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and other
Thai leaders during a five-day visit that began with a private
audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the country's powerful
constitutional monarch.
   In his statement, Chatichai urged China to expand trade and
investment with Asian and Pacific nations to help sustain the
region's rapid economic growth.
   Chatichai also pressed Vietnam to make a ``solid decision'' on
ending the 10-year war in Cambodia, which Vietnam invaded in late
1978.
   As key supporters of the anti-Vietnamese forces in Cambodia,
China and Thailand are expected to coordinate views on how to end
the war.
   Asked in Beijing about China's military aid to the Khmer Rouge,
the strongest of the three resistance armies, Li said China supports
all three factions and ``our only purpose for this kind of
assistance to the Kampuchean resistance forces is to fight against
the Vietnamese invaders.''
   He said China's decision to stop arming the Khmer Rouge ``is
totally dependent on when Vietnam withdraws its troops from
Kampuchea.''
   The Khmer Rouge have recently been accused of using Chinese
weapons in attacks on forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son
Sann, leaders of the other two anti-Vietnamese factions.

<HEAD>Credit-Repair Officials Settle Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two officials of a closed credit-repair company
have agreed to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission
banning them from claiming that they can improve people's credit
ratings.
   James Thomas Gray Sr., president, and Donald Gray, manager of
Credit-Rite, Inc., signed the consent agreement announced Wednesday
by the FTC and Justice Department.
   Credit-Rite, headquartered in New Jersey, operated 29
credit-repair franchises in 13 states and the District of Columbia
before closing its doors last year. The company charged consumers
between $500 and $700 for its services and was one of the nation's
largest credit-repair companies.
   The FTC had charged that the company falsely claimed to be able
to improve credit ratings and then failed to honor its money-back
guarantee when it was unable to do so.
   In addition to prohibiting the Grays from making false claims in
future, the consent order requires them to give any future client
notice stating that they have no legal right to get any correct
information removed from their credit record.
   A similar agreement was signed in May by Jeffrey Roberts, another
former official of the company.
   In addition, all three men have pleaded guilty to federal
criminal charges in the case, with James Thomas Gray and Roberts
sentenced to prison terms and fines and all three ordered to pay
restitution to their former clients.
   Consumers seeking refunds of money paid to Credit-Rite should
contact Kathleen Connors, Collections Unit, U.S. Attorney's Office,
970 Broad St., Newark, N.J., 07102.
   In addition to the District of Columbia, Credit-Rite formerly
operated offices in New Jersey, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia.

<TEXT>
   The 800-member Maryland Club has accepted its
first black member in its 131-year history, a partner in a blue-chip
Baltimore law firm.
   George L. Russell Jr., 59, a partner in Piper & Marbury, is a
former judge and city solicitor and in 1973-74 was the first black
president of the city bar association.
   The Maryland Club, whose members include businessmen and other
power brokers, has been known both for its privacy and some of the
best food in town, including its terrapin, which are kept alive in a
zinc bin in the wine cellar.
   Russell, contacted by the Baltimore Sun, refused to comment on
his admission, as did club president Charles B. Reeves.
   ``How we conduct our affairs is our private matter,'' Reeves told
the newspaper. ``I wouldn't tell you what I'd had for dinner here
tonight if you asked.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court in June unanimously upheld a New York City
law that bars business-oriented clubs with more than 400 members
from discriminating against women and minorities. The ruling
prompted activists, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, to
begin looking at the membership practices of clubs throughout the
state.
   Reeves said the decision had nothing to do with Russell's
membership.

<HEAD>Absentee Ballots Key to MacKay, Mack Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Connie Mack held a slim lead over
Democrat Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay in the U.S. Senate race this
morning with key absentee ballots to be counted.
   ``I feel quite confident we're going to be declaring victory. The
question is when,'' Mack said Wednesday in Tampa before heading home
to await the final count.
   As 3.9 million votes filtered in election night, exit polls were
enough for the three major television networks to declare MacKay the
winner.
   But Mack squeezed ahead Wednesday as partial results from 134,000
absentee ballots came in.
   With all precincts in and some absentee ballots counted, Mack had
1,982,760 votes and MacKay had 1,977,824 votes _ a margin of 4,936.
   Mack carried the conservative Panhandle area, while MacKay
carried the vote-rich south Florida counties of Dade, Broward and
Palm Beach and the Tampa Bay area. Mack won Brevard, Duval and
Orange counties.
   In unofficial returns, MacKay carried 36 counties and Mack 31.
   As of this morning, Dade's 23,000 absentee ballots and Duval's
18,000 ballots remained uncounted.
   The results are subject to a recount. Under Florida law, an
automatic recount is required if the margin between the candidates
is less than one-half of 1 percent.
   ``There's still a ray of hope out there,'' MacKay Campaign
Manager Greg Farmer said Wednesday night, conceding that trends
favored Mack.
   ``I personally find it tragic that this happened to one of
Florida's best and brightest,'' Farmer said. ``But the people have
chosen.''
   At first the people appeared to be choosing MacKay. ``Hey Buddy,
you're a senator,'' read the Wednesday headline in some editions of
the Ocala Star-Banner.
   But Mack spokesman Brian Riley said the Cape Coral congressman
never gave up hope.
   ``He's very upbeat,'' Riley said Wednesday evening. ``Even when
ABC projected MacKay the winner, he kept the faith, even more than
people on the staff. He kept saying there were a lot of votes out
there.''
   MacKay said he would remain patient and relax at home with his
family, praying and reading poetry until all of the votes are in.
   ``We'll just have to wait it out,'' said MacKay, adding that
Rudyard Kipling's ``If'' would be among his readings. ``I've got a
lot of time invested in this already.''
   Mack's late campaign strategy was based on George Bush's large
lead in polls and President Reagan's popularity in Florida. MacKay
counted on his experience and glowing reputation to overcome
problems faced by his party's national ticket.
   Mack's commercials, with the theme ``Hey Buddy, You're Liberal!''
tried to paint the moderate MacKay with the same brush that brought
the GOP success nationally. MacKay said he was in the ``Lloyd
Bentsen southern wing'' of the party, and campaigned with retiring
three-term incumbent Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   Mack no doubt benefited from George Bush's 61 percent share of
the presidential vote. ``We were handicapped by something we had
nothing to do with,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman Charles
Whitehead.
   Mack, a former Cape Coral bank president and grandson of the
Baseball Hall of Fame manager, and MacKay, an Ocala lawyer who's
been one of Florida's most-praised politicians for two decades, both
were elected to Congress in 1982.

   An elementary school principal has been arrested
on charges of buying crack outside his home, police said.
   Matthew Barnwell, 55, principal since 1974 of a public school in
the Bronx, was arrested Wednesday and charged with possession of a
controlled substance, a misdemeanor, said police spokesman Detective
Joseph McConville.
   McConville said police saw Barnwell buy two vials of crack
Wednesday a block from his home in Harlem. Barnwell was held for
arraignment today.
   The arrest came a week after the school system _ the nation's
largest with nearly 1 million students _ unveiled a plan to attack
the problem of drugs in school.
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green reacted with ``shock and
disappointment that the presence of drugs has reached into the
administrative offices'' of the school system, said Melanie Radley,
an aide to Green.
   The chancellor had announced a program that requires students at
every grade level to know about the dangers of drugs and forbids
students to carry beepers, which are used to set up drug deals.
   Board of Education spokesman Bob Terte said Barnwell would be
reassigned to an office job pending the outcome of the case.

<HEAD>Aquino Predicts Strong, Close Relationship With Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino today
predicted a ``close and strong'' relationship with the George Bush
administration.
   Mrs. Aquino spoke today in an interview on ``CBS This Morning''
which had been taped several hours earlier.
   ``I am certainly looking forward to having a very close and
strong relationship with the Bush administration,'' she said, noting
that she had met Bush during her 1986 visit to Washington.
   The Philippine president, who will mark her 1,000th day in office
on Nov. 21, said she wants to consult with members of the Philippine
Congress before opening talks on renewal of the U.S. military bases
agreement, which lapses in 1991. The United States recently agreed
to give nearly $1 billion in aid for use of Clark Air Base, Subic
Navy Base and other installations during the agreement's remaining
two years.
   Asked if she would like to see a new treaty, Mrs. Aquino repeated
the position she has taken since becoming president in a February
1986 revolt against Ferdinand Marcos. ``That is something that I am
not answering at the moment,'' she said. ``I would like to keep my
options open as far as that is concerned.''
   She said her government is awaiting an appeals court decision in
Switzerland in its effort to gather evidence for seven cases against
Marcos. The government has accused Marcos and his family and
associates of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars and removing
it from the country before his ouster. Marcos also faces charges in
the United States.
   Mrs. Aquino said that in the nearly 1,000 days she has been in

   An explosion and fire at an oil refinery
killed 17 people, and the blaze burned through the night and into
today, officials said. A company spokesman said sabotage was not
ruled out as the cause.
   Doctors said nine people died today in hospitals and that 13
people were in critical condition with burns.
   Firefighters battled the blaze at the state-owned Bharat
Petroelum Corp. Ltd. Refinery in Bombay's suburb throughout the
night, K.R.S. Narayan, director of the refinery division, said.
   The fire was still burning in one of the tanks containing highly
flammable naphtha today, but Narayan said the blaze was under
control.
   Two huge tanks of naphtha burst into flames after an explosion at
the refinery on Wednesday. Eight people died immediately.
   Three nearby tanks were emptied in an effort to keep the fire
from spreading to more than 300 others in the 430-acre refinery on
the northeast edge of Bombay.
   ``There was a small explosion followed by a fire,'' said Narayan.
``A tank can't explode by itself. We are not ruling out sabotage.''
   Narayan said the blast and fire blew off the roof of a tank
containing 250 tons of naphtha and a nearby tank containing 150 tons
of naphtha soon caught fire. The clouds of black smoke could be seen
12 miles away.
   Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the explosion
may have occurred in an adjacent dispatch unit where four trucks
were reduced to blackened pieces of metal. The trucks had been
loaded with drums of bitumen manufactured at the plant.
   ``All I heard was a big bang. By the time I turned around to see
what was happening, my shirt was on fire,'' trucker Abdul Majique
told the United News of India news agency. It said he suffered burns
over 20 percent of his body, mostly on his arms and legs.
   Originally established far from residential areas, the tank farm
is now close to Bombay's suburb of Chembur, which has a population
of half a million.

   A 5-year-old girl was found dead and
four relatives were discovered unconscious from carbon monoxide
poisoning, hours after an emergency room doctor sent them home with
what he diagnosed as the flu, authorities said.
   One of the four family members was in critical condition today.
   A woodburning stove's clogged flue and vent allowed carbon
monoxide to build up in the house where the victims were found,
investigators said.
   A doctor at Stormont-Vail Regional Medical Center in Topeka
diagnosed their symptoms of dizziness and nausea as the flu Tuesday,
and they returned home about midnight, said Pottawatomie County
Investigator Gerald Schmidt.
   A friend who had driven them to the hospital Tuesday found Amanda
Crane, 5, of Albion, Mich., dead the next morning.
   The girl's grandmother Pat Routh, 43, was listed in critical
condition. Her mother and granfather were in satisfactory condition
and her 2-year-old sister was listed as fair.
   A spokeswoman at Stormont-Vail declined to identify the doctor
who had examined them. Stormont-Vail officials said the hospital
would investigate.

<TEXT>
   Of all the men who worked for President Richard
Nixon, none was closer than John Mitchell. And none, perhaps, was as
deeply involved in the Watergate scandal.
   Mitchell was finishing out his days as attorney general in early
1972 when a former assistant, John Dean, brought former FBI man G.
Gordon Liddy to see him.
   Liddy, then working for the re-election committee, had a plan for
conducting political espionage on the Democrats. As he outlined it,
it involved the use of burglaries and prostitutes and would cost $1
million.
   Mitchell later testified he rejected the plan out of hand.
   Dean brought Liddy back a second time with a scaled down plan
that Mitchell also rejected even though the cost was only a half
million.
   A third plan was submitted in writing and while Mitchell
steadfastly denied approving it, by all other accounts he gave his
OK.
   He was indicted and tried along with two other top Nixon aides,
chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and domestic counselor John D.
Erhlichman, on charges they had tried to conceal the identifies of
the people involved in the burglary of Democratic party headquarters
that resulted from the Liddy plan.
   Mitchell was convicted of conspiring to obstruct justice,
obstruction of justice, lying to a grand jury, and perjury. A charge
of lying to the FBI was dismissed by U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica.
   He served 19 months in a federal prison, but five months of it
was spent outside while he underwent hip and artery surgery.
   Jeb Stuart Magruder, a Nixon re-election committee official who
served eight months in prison for Watergate crimes, said today he
believed that White House paranoia drew Mitchell and others into the
Watergate scandal.
   ``I don't think John was interested at all in becoming involved
in what became known as Watergate, but the pressure from the White
House was very tough to deal with,'' he said in an interview on
``CBS This Morning.''
   ``We all came to the White House wanting to serve Richard Nixon,
and we tried to serve him well, and I'm afraid when it got to that
point there was a willingness to cover up, obstruction of justice,
which of course was wrong in retrospect,'' Magruder said.

   Police today prevented three American
Jewish activists from entering President Kurt Waldheim's office to
deliver a letter calling for his resignation.
   Rabbi Avi Weiss, Glenn Richter, and Bernie Glickman wore yellow
Stars of David and the striped garb of Nazi concentration camp
inmates.
   The three are from the New York-based Coalition of Concern and
are in Vienna for the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Nazi
thugs destroyed Jewish homes and businesses and beat Jews.
   Waldheim has been accused by Jewish groups of taking part in
atrocities when he served in the Balkans for the German army during
World War II. The president denies the allegations.
   ``Waldheim's election is a legitimation of the crimes of the
Holocaust,'' Weiss said, standing under the Hofburg palace balcony
where Adolf Hitler addressed crowds after the March 1938 annexation
of Austria to Nazi Germany.
   With a prayer shawl over his shoulders, Weiss and the others
began to walk to Waldheim's offices nearby to deliver a letter
calling for his resignation, prosecution of Nazi war criminals and
reparations for Nazi victims.
   Richter read reporters the letter, which told Waldheim, ``The
voice of moral conscience will follow you.''
   As the three began to walk, a policeman told them in English they
could not continue what he termed their ``demonstration.'' In
Austria, a demonstration must be registered with police 24 hours in
advance.
   Nine uniformed police surrounded the trio and refused to let them
move on.
   Weiss ended the protest, which attracted little attention from
passers-by.

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Utah Bureau of Air Quality has approved
an Air Force plan to detonate explosives equal to 250 tons of TNT to
test a new type of munitions storage shed.
   The blast _ equivalent to about one-eightieth of the explosive
force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 _ tentatively
is scheduled for Monday at the Air Force's Utah Test and Training
Range, 70 miles from Salt Lake City.
   The test is intended to determine how far apart the storage sheds
must be to prevent an explosion in one from detonating explosives in
others.
   Burnell Cordner, director of the air quality bureau, said the
blast would create no significant air pollution problems, and he
issued the necessary permit.
   Among the conditions set by the bureau were a requirement that
the wind not be blowing toward populated areas and that there be no
temperature inversion, which could trap the blast force near the
ground.
   The Air Force said that in an ``absolutely worst-case scenario,''
the blast could break windows on the Wasatch Front, where Provo,
Salt Lake City and Ogden are situated, but that can be avoided by
detonating in proper weather.
   Steve Erickson of Downwinders, a watchdog group, said the Air
Force has not properly investigated the geology in the area. He said
the soil might be softer than expected and capable of producing
large, destructive shock waves.
   ``If their calculations are correct and everything is done
properly under right conditions, and if there is no subsurface
problem, then probably this will go off without any significant
environmental, human health or economic damage,'' he said.
   ``However, if it occurs at the wrong time, or if there are
subsurface problems, it could cause real problems.''

<HEAD>Britain and Iran Resume Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thoughout to UPDATE with comment, effect on hostages. No

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Iran said today they have resumed full
diplomatic relations, ending a 17-month break in ties caused in part
by the arrest of an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges.
   Today's announcement followed talks in Vienna between Sir David
Myers, Britain's assistant under secretary of state for Middle
Eastern affairs, and Dr. Mahmoud Vaezi, director general of Iran's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   Iran and Britain ``have decided to resume full diplomatic
representation with immediate effect based on reciprocity, mutual
respect and non-interference in each others' affairs,'' said a
Foreign Office statement.
   Tehran Radio said a statement and memorandum of understanding
were signed at Iran's mission in Vienna after a nine-hour session
that ended early this morning. Myers traveled to the Austrian
capital Wednesday for the third round of negotiations since August.
   Mohammad Basti, Iran's lone diplomat in Britain throughout the
diplomatic freeze, hinted that the resumption of ties could speed
the release of Britons held hostage by pro-Iranian Islamic militants
in Lebanon.
   Questioned on British Broadcasting Corp. radio, Basti said the
hostage issue had not arisen in the negotiations, but added: ``If
you are trying to imply that the new relationship between Iran and
Britain may contribute to that end, I'm not going to deny that.''
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, whose envoy Terry Waite
disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to help free the
hostages, was also asked whether renewed ties would help the
hostages.
   ``Certainly this cannot do any harm,'' he said. ``We must wait
and see. This is welcome news. After all, the purpose of this
diplomacy is to make it easy for governments to talk to each other.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the hostages' plight was
not included in the discussions.
   ``There's no bargain or secret agenda,'' he told the BBC, but he
added that the thaw enabled Britain ``more effectively to press the
case at every opportunity for the Iranians to use all the influence
they have got to secure the release of hostages.
   Diplomatic relations were curtailed in June 1987 after an Iranian
diplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain and
militants kidnapped and beat up a British diplomat in Tehran.
   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Tehran, closed the Iranian
consulate in Manchester, northern England, and reduced the number of
Iranian staff at the London embassy to one.
   Since then, British interests in Iran have been looked after by
Sweden.
   A diplomatic source in London, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in each
country to assume posts over the next several months.
   Howe said Britain would have a charge d'affaires in Iran within a
few weeks, and an exchange of ambassadors ``within hopefully six
months of that.''
   Besides Waite, Britain is seeking the release of journalist John
McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan. The Foreign Office says it also
seeks word on Alec Collett, a New York-based British journalist
whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was
never found.

   Iran's chief negotiator says he expects the
exchange of sick and wounded prisoners with Iraq to improve the
climate of peace talks between the Persian Gulf enemies.
   But Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati also said there is no
chance the two nations will reach a comprehensive peace settlement
unless Iraq recognizes the border between the nations as it was set
under a 1975 treaty.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Velayati also said
Wednesday night he sees no prospects so far for improving ties with
the United States.
   He said Iran will continue efforts to obtain the release of
hostages in Lebanon although ``our possibilities are limited.''
   Iran and Iraq agreed to a proposal by the International Committee
of the Red Cross to exchange 1,569 sick and wounded POWs. Velayati
sai ``this may create a better atmosphere'' at the talks and may
``make them more active.''
   He again said Iran considers this exchange to be independent of
the talks, which are aimed making permanent the cease-fire that took
effect Aug. 20.
   Repatriation of another 100,000 prisoners must be linked to other
points in the U.N. cease-fire resolution that both sides have
endorsed, he said.
   He said the highest priority in the resolution is the provision
calling for both sides to withdraw troops to ``internationally
recognized boundaries.''
   The dispute over the border has stalled the talks since they
began Aug. 25, because Iraq repudiated a 1975 treaty with Iran that
defined the border.
   ``International law confirms our position that the treaty remains
valid,'' Velayati said. ``When you say that the first step should be
the withdrawal to internationally recognized borders, where is that
border if you do not have a valid treaty?''
   Commenting on the issue of hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in
Lebanon, Velayati said Iran's efforts have helped free ``many
people, including Americans, Germans, regardless of their
nationality.''
   ``We continue our humanitarian efforts to get these hostages
released. But we really don't know the destiny of these people in
Lebanon and which group has which hostages. We have some spiritual
relations with the Moslems in Lebanon. But our possibilities are
limited.''
   Nine Americans are held in Lebanon, including Terry Anderson,
chief Mideast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.

   Opposition lawmakers walked out of a
Crystal Night ceremony today after claiming a speech by the
parliament president failed to express proper grief for Nazi crimes
against Jews.
   The 26-page speech by President Philipp Jenninger made some
listeners cry but drew angry criticism from other members of
parliament, who said Jenniger recounted Nazi atrocities in an
inappropriately cool and dispassionate manner.
   ``He marched through history with the intellect of combat
boots,'' said Wolfgang Lueder, a parliament member of the Free
Democratic Party.
   The controversy marred a session marking the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the first night of organized Nazi terror against the
Jews.
   
   The ceremony featured an emotional appearance by Ida Ehre, an
88-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor who read from Paul
Celan's poem ``Todesfuge.''
   
   ``Death is a master from Germany, his eye is blue,'' Ms. Ehre, a
well-known actress and director in Hamburg, read from the famous
work. ``He strikes thee with leaden bullets, he strikes thee
exactly.''
   Ms. Ehre, dressed in black with a white blouse, spoke before
parliament and invited guests, including West German Jewish leader
Heinz Galinski.
   During the Third Reich, the Nazis barred the Jewish actress from
working and eventually sent her to a concentration camp for several
years.
   Later during today's session, Ms. Ehre put her hands on her
forehead and began crying as Jenninger began reading an eyewitness
account of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942.
   ``Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' the
56-year-old Jenninger read. ``Some of those shot were still moving,
some lifted their arms and turned their heads, to show they were
still alive.''
   As he read, some of the lawmakers in the audience appeared on the
verge of tears, and federal President Richard von Weizsaecker at one
point buried his head in his hand.
   But some opposition lawmakers said other portions of Jenniger's
lacked a feeling of atonement for what happened to the Jews during
the Holocaust, and demanded he resign as a parliament president.
   Social Democratic and Greens party members left the hall to
protest the speech, which was part of the hour-long service
televised live nationwide.
   ``I don't agree with this speech, but I will express my criticism
within the party,'' said Johannes Gerster, a member of Jenninger's
own Christian Democratic Party.
   Lueder said Jenninger ``spoke of Germans and foreign Jews instead
of Jewish Germans.'' Lueder criticized Jenninger for using
expressions such as ``Arianization of property,'' without sufficient
explanation of its ruthless meaning during the Third Reich. He also
criticized Jenninger for not using the expression, ``German Jews,''
when talking about the victims of the Nazi terror.
   Social Democrat and Greens members criticized Jenninger for
presenting the speech ``in a dry emotionless way,'' and for ``not
clearly expressing repulsion at what the Nazis did.''
   West Germany, Austria and communist East Germany have held
observances this week as a reminder of the death and destruction
begun during Kristallnacht and carried on throughout the Holocaust.
   On the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazi thugs ransacked 7,500
Jewish businesses, destroyed thousands of Jewish homes and sent
30,000 Jews to concentration camps. Ninety-one Jews were killed and
267 synagogues destroyed.
   The rampage coordinated by Adolf Hitler's henchmen left city
streets littered with glass _ hence the name Kristallnacht, or Night
of Broken Glass.
   Historians say Kristallnacht was the start of the Nazis' campaign
to wipe out European Jews, a campaign that eventually claimed 6
million Jewish lives.
   There are about 32,000 Jews in West Germany. The number of
practicing Jews in East Germany is estimated at 450-600, with no
permanent rabbi.

   A woman who had herself sterilized in hopes
of receiving a lenient sentence for giving her 4-year-old son a
fatal dose of a prescription drug received 10 years in prison, half
the maximum.
   Melody Baldwin, who was sentenced Wednesday, said she agreed to
Superior Court Judge Roy F. Jones' suggestion that she undergo
sterilization and also put her newborn son up for adoption to
prevent any further harm.
   In 1987, Baldwin, 30-year-old unwed mother with a long history of
personality disorders, was charged with murder and child neglect
after her 4-year-old son, Joshua, died of a dose of a drug used to
treat mental illness.
   ``I don't know what happened, but nothing like this can ever
happen again,'' she said at sentencing.
   Prosecutors dropped the murder charge after she agreed to admit
the crime and plead guilty to neglect. While awaiting sentencing,
she conceived another child.

   The government used a surprise vote to ram
controversial tax-reform bills through a parliamentary committee
today, and police had to be summoned to control screaming opposition
members.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party, which holds a commanding
majority in the Tax Reform Committe and in parliament, approved the
bills, which would result in the first sweeping overhaul of the
country's tax system in 40 years.
   Opposition legislators, who had boycotted the committee session,
rushed into the chamber after the chairman suddenly called for a
vote. They screamed ``tyrant'' and ``disgrace,'' but about 50
policemen surrounded the chairman's desk and blocked them from
interfering with the vote.
   ``We are sorry that we finally could not reach agreement with
opposition parties,'' Shintaro Abe, the governing party secretary
general, said later. ``But we had to pass the bills because we are
running out of time.''
   The Liberal Democrats could have forced the bills through from
the start, but such a tactic is rare and against the Japanese
parliamentary tradition of seeking consensus and compromise, even if
only in making small changes to let the opposition save face. The
public is thought to regard forceful tactics as signs of arrogance
or undemocratic tendencies, which can cost a party votes.
   Opposition leaders reacted fiercely to the unexpected vote.
   ``It was an act of tyranny,'' said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary
general of the main opposition Japan Socialist Party. ``Passage of
such important legislation without the approval of the people and
opposition party not only neglects the people's interest, but also
indicates the LDP's intention to conceal scandal.''
   The opposition boycotted the committee session to try to force
the government to disclose more information about the so-called
Recruit scandal, which involves scores of top politicians, including
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
   The scandal began in July with revelations that the politicians
or their aides profited from selling unlisted shares they acquired
in the Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of the Recruit
Co., a big conglomerate.
   By boycotting parliamentary sessions, the opposition sought to
link progress on the tax-reform bills with further revelations that
would damage the Liberal Democrats.

   A Liberian oil tanker broke in half in stormy
weather in the north Atlantic today, burst into flames and began to
sink, spreading fire over the ocean and leaving the 27 crewmen
missing, coast guard officials said.
   A Canadian military aircraft flew over the scene nine hours after
the tanker sent a distress signal, and it spotted two empty life
rafts, said Paul Kendrick of the Canadian Search and Rescue
Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia. ``We have not found any
survivors,'' Kendrick said.
   Earlier, the Soviet ship Passat rushed from 26 miles away to help
the 65,700-ton Odyssey but was unable to get closer than a mile to
the stricken vessel because of the fire, authorities said.
   The Passat, which monitors weather on the ocean, told rescue
officials it found no sign of the Greek and Honduran crew and was
searching the area, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said.
   ``It doesn't sound very good at all,'' said a spokesman for the
British coast guard in Falmouth, England. ``The Soviet vessel has
lost radio contact with the tanker.''
   Kendrick said the fire was mostly out. The stern of the ship sank
and only the bow was afloat, and a large oil slick coated the ocean
surface, he said. He said a bulk carrier and another Canadian
aircraft were en route to the scene.
   Capt. Pat Phelan of the Canadian rescue center said the tanker
was about 700 miles east-northeast of Newfoundland. British
officials said it was about 1,200 miles west of England.
   Polembros Shipping Ltd. of London, operators of the Odyssey, said
half the crew was Greek, including the captain and all the officers,
and the other half was Honduran.
   ``We haven't heard any news at all about them,'' said a
spokeswoman, commenting on condition she was not identified. She
said the tanker is owned by Diamond Port Shipping Corp. of Monrovia,
Liberia.
   Phelan said the tanker was 52 degrees 38 minutes north latitude
and 34 degrees 39 minutes west longitiude, or near the center of the
North Atlantic.
   The Odyssey, built in 1971, sent a distress signal at 3:22 a.m.
saying it needed immediate assistance, the Falmouth spokesman said.
   The signal was picked up by Valentia Radio in southern Ireland
and relayed to British coast guard officials, he said. The British
alerted the Passat, one of several Soviet weather ships that operate
in that sector of the Atlantic.
   The tanker is in the Atlantic sector of responsibility covered by
the Canadians, and the emergency operation was being coordinated in
Halifax with assistance from British coast guard officials.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in Colchester said Valentia
Radio reported that the Odyssey left Sullom Voe, a Scottish oil
terminal, on Nov. 5 and was heading for the Canadian port of Come By
Chance.
   Canadian coast guard officer James Cormier said the weather at
the tanker site was stormy, with 46 mph westerly winds and 25-foot
waves.

   The sole supplier of rayon yarn used in
the space shuttle and military rockets reopened today as abruptly as
it closed a week ago.
   Workers began reporting to the aging Avtex Fibers Inc. textile
mill this morning.
   The reopening of the 1,300-employee plant took NASA and other
officials by surprise. The space agency had held discussions with
the company in an effort to ensure continued manufacture of the
rayon used in rocket nozzles.
   ``I was not aware of that,'' said Ed Medal, a spokesman for
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. ``To my
knowledge, there has not been a formalized agreement realized.''
   In a statement Wednesday, John N. Gregg, Avtex chairman and chief
executive officer, said the company was ``able to negotiate a
long-term contract with certain aerospace industry companies that
will allow Avtex Fibers-Front Royal to return to full production of
its fiber products.''
   Gregg said Avtex won the contract with ``the encouragement'' of
NASA and the Defense Department. He did not elaborate. The statement
did not specify what sort of arrangement was made or with whom.
   However, an aide for Rep. D. French Slaughter Jr., R-Va., said
the financial agent for the deal is space shuttle engine maker
Morton Thiokol Inc. H. George White III said Morton Thiokol is
wiring Avtex $1 million today for the mill's reopening and will
provide between $4 million and $5 million in the next week. The
total investment by the rocket maker will be around $19 million,
White said.
   Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said the company was continuing its
negotiations with Avtex, based in Valley Forge, Pa.
   ``It could be an interim sort of agreement,'' he said from the
company's headquarters in Ogden, Utah.
   Gregg announced Oct. 31 he was closing the 49-year-old mill,
citing economic fallout from the 1986 Challenger disaster, foreign
competition and stiff environmental regulations. The announcement
sent NASA, the Department of Defense and several government
contractors scrambling to figure out what the impact would be on the
space shuttle program and other projects that depend on a
carbonizable rayon fiber.
   NASA has said it has enough of the material on hand for another
10 shuttle flights. The fiber is used in engine nozzles of the
shuttle and a variety of defense missiles.

   President Reagan is continuing the state of
national emergency with respect to Iran ``to deal with the threat to
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States.''
   The national emergency was declared in 1979 and imposes a variety
of trade and related sanctions. It has been continued annually since
then. Reagan's order Wednesday continues it until Nov. 14, 1989.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the order does not
affect the freezing of Iranian assets in the United States, which is
in the jurisdiction of the U.S.-Iranian Claims Tribunal.
   Reagan's statement noted that the national emergency was declared
``to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy
and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in
Iran.''
   ``Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to
normal,'' the president's statement said, the national emergency
must continue in effect.

<TEXT>
   A jury today acquitted a man of sexually
molesting his 5{-year-old daughter in a case that drew national
attention when the girl's mother went to jail rather than let her
husband see the child.
   After about three hours of deliberation, a Superior Court jury
found 33-year-old Mark Russell Murabito of Derry not guilty.
Supporters in the back of the courtroom cheered.
   His former wife, Jesse Murabito, 40, was led from the courtroom
by supporters with her head down.
   Defense attorney Eugene McCann disputed the testimony of a child
psychiatrist and a pediatrician, arguing the child was influenced by
her mother and learned through repeated interrogations by her to
describe the alleged abuse.
   ``Do you think she learned the story?'' he asked during closing
arguments. ``Do you think she got a feel for what it is that mommy
is looking for?''
   He said the girl had been psychologically abused by her mother,
her father and the system, but not sexually abused by her father.
``She has been bounced off everyone you can think of as it relates
to psychological abuse,'' he said.
   County Attorney Carleton Eldredge argued that the girl had
engaged in adult sexual behavior unusual and inappropriate for
children her age, and that it must have been shown to her.
   ``The girl was her own best spokesperson when she said that daddy
touched her,'' he said.
   Eldredge also disputed defense contention that Mrs. Murabito's
behavior marked her as an obsessive paranoid. ``What is the standard
of a mother who thinks her child has been sexually abused?'' he
asked. ``Frantic probably doesn't describe it.''
   ``Jesse Murabito was motivated solely to defend her child and she
did it every way she knew how,'' he said. ``Within that context,
Jesse Murabito makes more sense than anybody we've heard from.''
   Dr. Muriel Sugarman, a child psychiatrist, and Dr. Charles
Shubin, a pediatrician who specializes in examining alleged sexually
abused children, had testified for the prosecution, supporting the
allegations of sexual abuse.

<TEXT>
   A report released today blamed lax safety standards
for a subway fire that killed 31 people last year. Hours before the
government study was issued, the two top men running London's subway
system resigned.
   The report said subway management ``did not guard against the
unpredictability of fire'' and that staff response to the Nov. 18
blaze was ``uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained.''
   Dr. Tony Ridley, chairman and chief executive of the London
Underground, announced his resignation this morning. Sir Keith
Bright, chairman of London Regional Transport, the controlling body,
quit Wednesday night. Bright had been chairman and chief executive
of the transport agency since 1982.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon presented the report to the
House of Commons on the government-ordered inquiry into the fire at
King's Cross station, the subway system's busiest station.
   During the 91-day inquiry, the board was criticized over safety
standards and Bright was criticized for appearing to promote the
theory that the fire was started by an arsonist.
   Police and forensic scientists said they believed the fire was
started by a lighted match or cigarette dropped by a smoker onto a
wooden escalator, which ignited grease-soaked trash underneath.
   Flames raced up the escalator into the ticket lobby. Following
the blaze, smoking was banned throughout the subway.
   In the report, attorney Desmond Fennell made 157 recommendations
to improve the subway, urging it to ``institute a managed safety
program.'' He said nobody had overall responsibility for safety at
the time of the fire.
   Ridley called the subway ``one of the safest forms of transport''
and criticized the 250-page report as an ``emotive document.''
   In June, Bright told the Fennell inquiry that he had he offered
to resign immediately after the fire but agreed to stay on at
Channon's request.
   Bright said in a statement Wednesday night that he has since
``devoted most of my energy ... to seeking to ensure that the
lessons of King's Cross have been ... learned and that actions
necessary to avoid a recurrence ... should be vigorously pressed
ahead.''
   He said he felt he had accomplished that task and, with the
impending release of the report, it was time to resign.
   Earlier this year, the board undertook more than 100
improvements, including the removal of wooden panels from
escalators, staff retraining and reinforcement of liaison procedures
with emergency services.
   Lawyer Ian Walker, who represents most of the families of the
victims, said of Bright's resignation: ``The decision will come as a
relief to many of the relatives of victims who feel very strongly
that London Regional Transport was very much to blame for the
tragedy.''
   Legislator John Prescott, the Labor Party's transport spokesman,
said: ``It is inevitable that Bright should resign in view of the
total failure of management to give proper safety.''
   Before the fire, only one person had died in a blaze on the
subway, in 1985. But fires are regularly reported on the crowded,
125-year-old system, parts of which badly need modernizing.
   A safety report two years before the King's Cross fire said there
were 10 serious fires in the system between 1976 and 1985.
   The Association of London Authorities, representing London
boroughs controlled by the Labor Party, said subway safety had
deteriorated since the King's Cross fire. It said there were 21
serious fires on the subway in the first six months of this year
compared to 10 in all of 1987.
   A serious fire is defined as one that stops trains for more than
30 minutes.
   The subway carries 750 million passengers a year. More than
200,000 a day board or leave trains at King's Cross station, a
multi-level complex that is a terminus for commuter rail lines.
   In the worst post-war accident on the subway, 43 people died and
74 were hurt when a train crashed at Moorgate station in the
business district in 1975.

<HEAD>Students Clamor to Hear Popular Chinese Dissident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's most famous dissident gave a rare public
lecture to a standing-room-only crowd of students at Beijing
University, telling them he believes ``demonstrations are quite
beautiful.''
   More than 600 students packed a small lecture hall and the
adjoining hallway Wednesday night to hear Fang Lizhi's lecture on
``Physics and Beauty,'' the astrophysicist's first public speech on
the campus since May.
   Fang joked freely about government claims he helped inspire
pro-democracy student demonstrations two years ago, which led to his
expulsion from the Communist Party.
   ``I think demonstrations are quite beautiful,'' Fang said
pointing to a cartoon of banner-waving demonstrators that he said
illustrated his concept of beauty: the unity of chaos and order.
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``some people don't appreciate this
kind of beauty.''
   Thousands of students at colleges in Beijing, Shanghai and other
major cities took to the streets in the winter of 1986-87 to press
demands for democracy. The protests ended with harsh warnings from
the government and the ouster of party chief Hu Yaobang for failing
to crack down on the demonstrators.
   Fang was forced to resign as vice president of the University of
Science and Technology in eastern China and expelled from the party.
   Fang noted the students were criticized for lacking a
well-defined program to back up their pro-democracy slogans, but he
praised them for having started people thinking.
   ``The slogans were correct,'' he said. ``Over the past two years,
people have been in the process of developing the arguments and
reasoning to support them.''
   Fang reiterated his views on the need for greater freedom for
Chinese reporters, publishers and researchers. He cited difficulties
with getting his own books published as evidence that China does not
have a free press.
   Student organizers of the lecture said they announced the lecture
only two hours in advance to avoid attracting attention from school
authorities, and the large turnout on such short notice indicated
Fang's popularity.
   The audience frequently broke into applause throughout the
lecture, usually in response to Fang's subtle political humor.
   Fang said campus authorities approved the student-organized
lecture series of which his talk was a part, but had not given
specific permission for him to speak. ``I don't think there will be
any problems,'' he said. ``I only implied a lot of things, I didn't
say anything directly.''

   Farmers are expected to gain more than
7,000 acres of arable land when authorities remove an electronic
alarm system along the border with Austria, the official MTI news
agency said Thursday.
   Imre Pozsgay, minister of state and a member of the Politburo,
said last month the alarm system had become outdated ``historically,
politically and technically.''
   Hungarians have been allowed to travel to the West more freely
after laws were enacted at the beginning of this year allowing an
unlimited number of exits to passport holders.
   The agency said the removal of the alarm system was expected to
yield about 7,410 acres of land to cooperative farms near the
western town of Koszeg.

   A bomb planted outside a judicial office
building was discovered and defused minutes before it was to
explode, authorities said Thursday.
   Police said the bomb, consisting of 35 pounds of dynamite and 11
pounds of nitroglycerin, could have brought down the building, which
houses the offices of magistrates.
   The burning fuse was spotted and extinguished late Wednesday
night by a police patrol, and bomb experts were called in to defuse
the device.
   Police said they suspected the bomb was planted by the Mafia in
an attempt to intimidate investigating magistrates.
   Gela, a town of 80,000 people on Sicily's southern coast, has
been plagued by a war between rival Mafia clans that has claimed 23
lives this year, including the slaying of a 17-year-old boy
Wednesday.

   A flock of ravens flew into homes and attacked
people in a neighborhood outside Tel Aviv in what one resident said
Thursday looked like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's horror movie
``The Birds.''
   Police shot and killed one of the large black birds after several
residents of Yahud, a town about six miles east of Tel Aviv,
complained that about 20 ravens had perched on nearby trees and were
harassing residents, Israel radio reported.
   Two people suffered scratches in the attacks before police killed
the most aggressive bird Wednesday night, the radio said.
   The daily Maariv newspaper published a picture of a policeman
holding the dead raven, which had a wing span of about three feet.
   ``This raven was evil. It had frightening black eyes, large wings
and a large beak,'' Yahud resident Pazit Sasson was quoted as saying.
   Another woman said the ravens had been a problem in the
neighborhood for more than a month.
   ``The birds would fly around the houses and bother us when we
were sleeping,'' said the woman, who was not identified. ``For two
weeks we have been sleeping with closed shutters and closed
windows.''
   ``It was just like the movie by Hitchcock. Whenever we opened our
windows, the birds would arrive,'' she told the radio.
   A police spokesman said the neighborhood was quiet Thursday and
troopers had decided against asking a special Air force unit to help
them chase away the ravens.
   Eliezer Frankenberg, coordinator for wild animal protection at
Israel's Nature Reserve Authority, said he did not expect the birds
to continue harassing the neighborhood.
   ``Ravens are very smart,'' Frankenberg said. ``If one of them is
killed, the others will quickly learn not to attack.''
   He said ravens usually do not bother humans unless the birds are
defending their territory. The birds are not prone to attack and
should not be considered a threat, he added.
   ``Something like this happens from time to time, but it is very
unusual,'' Frankenberg said. ``The birds may try to peck someone on
the head a little bit, but I wouldn't call it an attack.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists probing the sea floor off the coast
of Oregon have discovered a new field of hot springs, mineral
deposits and exotic animal life, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday.
   The area, as long as five city blocks, offers a new frontier for
scientific exploration, according to Peter Rona, chief scientist for
the team.
   Rona has led NOAA's deep-sea explorations in both the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans in recent years, discovering a variety of volcanic
hot springs in both oceans as well as exotic tube worms and other
life forms.
   The new finds were made along an underwater mountain range called
the Gorda Ridge, about 100 miles off the Oregon coast. The
scientists went as deep as 10,000 feet using a Navy deep submergence
vehicle.
   The finding will allow scientists ``to study first-hand how
sea-floor hot springs form metallic mineral deposits, support exotic
forms of life and influence the ocean environment,'' Rona said.
   Water temperatures in the hot springs were measured as high as
500 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Rona said that in the area large plates in the Earth's crust are
being pulled and cracked, allowing sea water to contact with
volcanic rocks.
   The heated water leaches metals from the rock and deposits them
on the sea floor.
   Thickets of tube worms several feet high, topped with bright red
plumes, are growing around the hot springs, the scientists said. In
addition they found crabs, octopuses, deep-sea fish and other life
forms.
   These deep-water vents in the sea floor were only discovered a
few years ago when Rona and other scientists began investigating the
waters around the United States after President Reagan proclaimed an
Exclusive Economic Zone offshore.
   The vents have been found in the Gorda and Juan de Fuca ridges
off the Oregon coast and also far out in the Atlantic.
   In addition to Rona, participants in the Gorda Ridge dives
included scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, Oregon State
University, the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Resources,
and the universities of California-Davis and Hawaii.

   Unisys Corp. today pleaded guilty to
mischarging the Army on a $9.2 million contract and agreed to pay
$810,600 in fines and other penalties.
   The $810,600 include $250,000 in criminal penalties and $250,000
in civil restitution.
   The company, based in Blue Bell, Pa., pleaded guilty to three
felony false-claims charges that it misallocated labor charges
totaling $250,000 in 1985, 1986 and 1987 in fulfilling a computer
software support contract.
   The contract was between Sperry Corp., a predecessor of Unisys,
and the Army's Information Systems Command at Fort Huachuca in
Sierra Vista, Ariz.
   The improper activities involved shifting charges between
contracts and occurred at Sperry's Sierra Vista office, the company
acknowledged.
   A. Bates Butler III, an attorney representing Unisys, told U.S.
District Judge Richard Bilby the Army has determined that Unisys is
a responsible contractor and will not be barred from holding
government contracts.
   U.S. Attorney Stephen McNamee and Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary
Korn said Unisys cooperated in the investigation and, in fact,
alerted Pentagon investigators to the last $150,000 of the total
$250,000 in misallocations.
   Korn said the $810,600 owed by Unisys was significantly more than
the profit Sperry earned on the project.
   The five-year contract, which expired in September 1987, involved
computer hardware and software development and support, said
spokesman Wren Timberlake.
   In August, Unisys said it outlined its intention to plead guilty
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC
requires companies to describe any corporate actions that might
affect stockholders.
   Unisys Corp. has contracts with the Army Information Systems
Command totaling $80 million, Timberlake said. The command provides
data processing services to Army units worldwide.

   Folks selling goods at craft fairs will find
life a little easier under a change in federal consumer-protection
rules announced Thursday.
   The change in Federal Trade Commission regulations will exempt
arts and crafts sellers, and also sellers of automobiles at public
auctions and tent sales, from having to give buyers a three-day
cooling-off period.
   FTC rules in effect since 1972 have required that people selling
items costing $25 or more, and making the sale somewhere other than
their normal place of business, give buyers three days to change
their minds, and provide a notice of cancellation for the consumer
to use if necessary.
   That regulation was intended to protect buyers who succumb to
high-pressure tactics on the part of door-to-door sales people.
   The commission said it decided to give an exemption to people who
sell arts and cfafts items at fairs because those sales do not
appear to present a threat of deceptive practices.
   The exemption for auto sales at auctions and tent sales applies
as long as the seller has a permanent place of business where a
consumer can go to complain should a problem arise with the purchase.

   Economic worries kept the financial markets from
celebrating George Bush's decisive victory over Michael Dukakis,
even though traders had anticipated and welcomed another Republican
in the White House.
   The dollar dropped sharply against most major currencies
Wednesday after rallying briefly in Japan, and prices for stocks and
bonds followed suit.
   It ended lower in Tokyo today and continued to fall elsewhere.
   ``The markets had already discounted a Bush victory after the
second (presidential) debate ... but a lot of uncertainty remains
about key economic problems,'' said David Resler, chief economist
for Nomura Securities Co. International.
   A key issue, economists say, is whether Bush and the
Democratic-controlled Congress can work together to trim the budget
and trade deficits inherited from the Reagan administration.
   ``I look at it as basic economic reality versus political
constraints,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International. ``Bush has said there would be
no tax increase ... so that will mean budget cuts. The impasse will
be over where to cut.''
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lead a
broad market decline Wednesday, dropping 9.25 to 2,118.24 despite
recovering some lost ground in the final 90 minutes of trading. The
closely watched index advanced 2.85 points on Election Day.
   By midday today, stock prices turned mixed. The Dow Jones average
was down 0.89 points at 2,117.35 at noon EST.
   Interest rates moved up as bond prices declined Wednesday. The
yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue hovered around 9
percent for the first time in more than a month, while its price
fell about $5 per $1,000 face amount. Short-term rates also rose
slightly.
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential Bache Securities
Inc., said that a weak dollar in foreign exchange also helped drag
down stock and bond prices. Other factors affecting the markets, he
said, included this week's $30 billion quarterly Treasury auction
and concerns over whether the Federal Reserve might be quietly
tightening credit.
   ``It's hard to disentangle all those things,'' said Maury Harris,
chief economist for PaineWebber Inc.
   The dollar initially rallied overseas after Bush's victory, but
reversed course later in Japan and Europe, largely on profit-taking
and investor nervousness. It continued weakening in domestic trading
despite reports of central bank intervention.
   The dollar dropped to three-month lows against the West German
mark, the British pound and the Dutch guilder in Europe, and to a
five-month low against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar selloff intensified following comments from Martin
Feldstein, former head of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers and
an adviser to Bush. He said the U.S. currency should drop at least
20 percent in the value during the next three years to help reduce
the trade gap. A cheaper dollar makes U.S. exports more attractive
in foreign markets.
   Apprehension about the economy under a new administration also
was shared in some overseas stock markets.
   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 46.36 points
today, to close at 28,166.42.
   In London on Wednesday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index fell 14.9 points to close at 1,825.7.
   Stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose
against major foreign currencies in the United States on Tuesday,
partly because of confidence Bush would defeat Dukakis and continue
the Reagan administration's economic policies.

   The number of requests for political
asylum in Switzerland reached a new monthly high of 2,321 in
October, authorities said Thursday.
   It marked a 15 percent increase from September and raised the
10-month total to 13,213, more than in all of 1987.
   Turkish nationals make up the bulk of the asylum seekers.
Authorities say most come in search of work rather than flee
persecution.
   The figures were made public at a national conference. It has
become a major political issue in Switzerland, where one out six
residents is a foreigner.
   Next month, a right-wing proposal to curb immigration sharply
will be voted on in a national referendum.
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp told the conference that she will
ask the Italian government to reintroduce mandatory visa
requirements for Turkish travelers to Italy.
   Most of the Turkish asylum seekers enter Switzerland illegally
from Italy.

the Vatican announced Thursday.
   Nasalli Rocca died Wednesday at a Rome clinic where he had been
admitted a week earlier, the Vatican said.
   Born in Piacenza, Nasalli Rocca was ordained a priest in 1927,
consecrated as bishop in 1969 and elevated to cardinal the same year
by Pope Paul VI.
   He served as close aide to popes Pius XI, Pius XII, John XXIII
and Paul VI.
   Services led by Pope John Paul II will be held Friday in St.
Peter's Basilica.
   His death brings to 154 the number of members of the College of
Cardinals, including 119 who are under the age of 80 and eligible to
vote for a pope.

   Federal projects ranging from bridges and a
transit line to an astronomical observatory in space were honored
with presidential awards for design excellence on Thursday.
   Frank Hodsoll, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
presented the awards on behalf of President Reagan in a ceremony in
the Old Executive Office Building, an annex of the White House.
   Prof. Robert Wilson, head of the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at University College, London, accepted the award for work
on the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite.
   The satellite is an astronomical observatory in space that can
look at almost any object in the universe. Last year it was used to
study the giant supernova explosion, and in 1986 it was used to
observe Halley's Comet. The satellite has two ground stations, one
at the Goddard Space Center in Maryland and one at Villafranca del
Castillo, near Madrid.
   Other awards were given to:
   _The Boxley Valley Land Use plan, Buffalo National River,
Arkansas.
   _Delaware Aqueduct, Lackawaxen, Pa.
   _East Huntington Bridge between Huntington, W. Va., and
Proctorville, Ohio.
   _National Gallery of Art Graphics and Exhibitions, Washington.

   State Patrol officers, guns at the ready,
surrounded hundreds of turkeys Thursday after a tractor-trailer
truck overturned, spilling the birds onto Interstate 35.
   ``We were prepared to shoot them because fowl are very difficult
to contain,'' patrol Capt. Loren Dykeman said.
   Traffic on the busy interstate was rerouted around the
interchange for four hours as six officers tried to prevent the
birds from fleeing into an adjoining lane of the highway.
   Authorities were concerned the birds would run into traffic and
cause another accident, but Dykeman said they huddled together to
keep warm in temperatures in the mid-30s.
   The turkeys' moment of thanksgiving was short-lived, however. The
1,000 birds were bound for a processing plant in Ellsworth and
workers loaded the last of the birds onto another truck, Dykeman
said. About 300 turkeys were killed in the crash, in which the
dirver was injured.

<HEAD>Owen County Advertises For Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge, white banner stretches over Main
Street downtown Owenton, bearing the uneasy message: ``Owen County
needs a doctor. Inquire at Courthouse.''
   ``We need two or three doctors,'' said James B. Ellis, 65, a
retired state worker. ``But we need at least one awful bad.''
   Rural areas across the country are desperate for doctors and are
turning to desperate measures to recruit them.
   ``My thinking in putting it (banner) up was to let the community
know that we are going to have a big problem in a few months,'' said
David Smith, a general practitioner who is planning to move from
Owenton in March.
   The banner paid off with at least one inquiry: A doctor driving
through town last week saw it and has begun talking with county
officials, said county Judge-Executive Horace ``Doug'' West.
   But there's nothing definite yet, he added.
   Owen County is raising money and hopes to guarantee a first-year
salary of $75,000 for a family doctor. In the past, the county has
guaranteed wages, given free office space and paid the salaries of
support personnel to woo doctors.
   But the county of 9,000 people has had trouble keeping young
doctors in the area.
   ``A doctor fresh out of school wants to move closer to home,''
West said. ``We're looking for a doctor who wants to make this his
home.''
   Smith, 31, who moved here several years ago as part of a federal
program now being phased out, wants to go home to his family in
Illinois. He has said he will leave in March, giving officials some
time to find a replacement.
   As of now, Owenton ranks 36th in Kentucky in terms of need for a
physician, said Danise Newton, program administrator for the
Physician Placement Service in the Department of Health Services.
   Robertson County is at the top of the list because it doesn't
have any doctors, Ms. Newton said.
   ``Kentucky is no different than many other states,'' Ms. Newton
said. ``It has a problem finding physicians for rural areas. There
is no magical way of doing it.''
   Ms. Newton said there were several reasons doctors are not
choosing to practice in rural areas.
   Hospitals are small or non-existent and doctors experience
professional isolation. Often, there is not another physician who
will cover for them, so there is no time off. Most physicians do
their residency in an urban area and don't want to move to a small
town. Spouses also have a problem finding jobs.
   ``There are much more lucrative practices in northern Kentucky,
Lexington or Louisville,'' said Brad Hughes, spokesman for the
Cabinet for Human Resources. ``Unless doctors are homegrown, they're
not going to a small community.''
   The crisis in Owenton is still a few checkups away. Two other
doctors are practicing in the area, but one wants to retire and the
other, Pamela Pieterse, is unsure whether she'll stay after her
contract expires next summer.

<HEAD>B-1 Crash Prompts Grounding, Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has returned to service 25 of its
98 B-1B bombers after inspecting them for electrical, hydraulic and
fule line problems, the Pentagon said today.
   The inspections were prompted by Tuesday's crash during a routine
training flight out of Dyess Air Force Base in west Texas. The four
men aboard ejected safely after steering the flaming aircraft away
from homes where it crashed west of Abilene.
   Pentagon officials said Wednesday that the remaining B-1Bs,
long-range bombers designed to be capable of carrying out nuclear
strikes against the Soviet Union, would be grounded until the
inspections were completed.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said 25 of the planes
had been inspected and returned to flight status as of 9 a.m. EST
today.
   Col. Albert Jensen, wing commander at Dyess, said television
footage of Tuesday's crash led Air Force officials to believe the
plane was downed by a fire in or around its two left-wing engines.
   Some training flights had resumed at Dyess by Wednesday
afternoon. Officials said the planes flying had passed the
inspection ordered by the Strategic Air Command.
   The inspections take two to three hours per plane, according to
the Air Force.
   An Air Force official at the Pentagon, who asked not to be named,
said the inspections generally focus on electrical, hydraulic and
fuel lines. The official declined to be more specific, as did Lt.
Col. George H. Peck, a spokesman at SAC headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
   SAC, which is responsible for land-based nuclear bomber and
missile forces, said the grounding and inspection order was issued
Wednesday as a ``normal precaution'' in the wake of a major accident.
   Peck said the order would not affect the B-1B's current standing
alert to be ready for immediate takeoff in the event of nuclear war.
   In Texas, the Air Force set up a roadblock to seal off the crash
site Wednesday and sent in military investigators, who spent the day
mapping the area and searching through debris.
   The wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles,
said Al Dostal, an Air Force spokesman.
   Jensen said his speculation of a fire around the left wing
engines was based on a video tape aired on a television newscast.
   The Air Force has been criticized over the past two years for its
handling of the B-1B program, primarily because of acknowledged
problems in developing the bomber's radar-jamming gear. However, the
service insists the plane is still the best long-range bomber in the
world.
   The Air Force has purchased 100 B-1Bs at a total cost of $27.3
billion, or about $273 million per plane. The last plane was
delivered on April 30.
   Tuesday's crash was the second involving a production-model B-1B
in 14 months, leaving the Air Force with 98 of its original 100
planes.
   The bombers have been deployed at four bases: Dyess; Ellsworth
AFB, S.D.; Grand Forks AFB, N.D., and McConnell AFB, Kan.
   The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B was the first addition to
America's manned bomber force in more than 25 years. The plane is
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and
the new B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber, the first of which is to be publicly
unveiled later this month.
   The Air Force lost the first of the B-1Bs on Sept. 28, 1987, when
a plane based at Dyess ran into a flock of migrating birds during a
low-level bomb run at a Colorado flight range. Three crew members
were killed.
   Earlier, before production-model planes entered the inventory,
the Air Force lost a B-1A prototype in August 1984 during a test
flight at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. One crewman died and two
were injured.
   The bomber, built by Rockwell International Corp., has a maximum
speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.

<TEXT>
   Baring a poorly kept secret, the Pentagon today
made public details of a ``Stealth'' jet fighter that has been ready
for five years to slip behind enemy lines in the event of war.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the
Stealth fighter first flew in June 1981 and was declared operational
in October 1983.
   The Air Force has ordered 59 of the planes; 52 of them have
already been delivered, he said, adding the plane is a single-seat,
twin-engine aircraft.
   The plane, which in some repsects resembles a small space shuttle
with swept wings and a V-tail, was unveiled primarily because the
Air Force needs to start flying the plane during daylight hours if
it is to integrate the fighter squadron's war plans with other
units, Howard said.
   The plane has been restricted, in the interests of secrecy and
national security, to nighttime flying ever since it was declared
operational, Howard said.
   The Stealth fighter ``is officially known as the F-117A,'' the
spokesman continued.
   ``It has been operational since October 1983 and is assigned to
the 4450th Tactical Group at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. The
aircraft is based at the Tonopah Test Range Airfield in Nevada.''
   Howard and Air Force officials, while releasing a photo of the
plane in flight, flatly declined to discuss how much the program
cost, the plane's dimensions or general capabilities such as speed,
its assigned combat role, the materials from which it was
constructed and the major subcontractors.
   The plane is built by the Lockheed Corp. at a tightly guarded
plant in Burbank, Calif., the Air Force said. Production line
workers at the Lockheed plant have gone to court with charges they
are being sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals.
   The service also acknowledged that three of the planes have
crashed. The first production model of the plane crashed with a
Lockheed Corp. pilot at the controls, the Air Force said.
   That test pilot survived the accident, for which no date was
given.
   The second crash occurred on July 11, 1986, near Bakersfield,
Calif., and the third on Oct. 14, 1987, at Nellis Air Force Base,
the service said. Both pilots died in those accidents.
   The decision to unveil the plane was prompted in part by Air
Force plans to display publicly its new B-2 Stealth bomber on Nov.
22, said defense officials who asked not to be named.
   The bomber has been built with more recent and advanced
technology than the fighter, so there was little reason to continue
to hide the fighter, the sources said.
   Pentagon officials also had concluded that even if they wanted to
keep the program secret, upcoming court fights were likely to
shatter security, the sources continued.
   According to military sources, the planes are kept at a high
state of readiness for use as ``aerial shock troops,'' capable of
slipping behind enemy lines without being detected and creating
confusion with unexpected bombing runs.
   The picture released by Howard shows a black or dark blue
metallic aircraft without exterior markings. Unlike the new Stealth
bomber, which is being constructed in the shape of a flying wing
without any sharp edges, the fighter resembles a sleek shuttle with
a small cockpit contained in a nose that comes to a sharp point.
   The two engines are grouped together below the V-shaped tail and
are not visible from the top or sides. The wings are swept to the
rear and appear to be fixed. From some angles, the plane almost
looks like a flying sting ray.
   The picture suggests the plane has been fabricated with some
unusual materials, but the Air Force declined to discuss the matter.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush seems to have been preparing to
become first lady for the 43 years since she married George Bush,
her prep school sweetheart and the first man she ever kissed.
   The wife of the president-elect, with her familiar halo of white
hair and a trademark pearl choker, has a mind of her own and doesn't
shrink from expressing her views to her husband _ in private.
   ``I tell George what I think, and nobody else,'' she says.
   But she made clear she won't be a first lady in the highly
visible style of Rosalynn Carter, who participated actively in White
House debates with her husband, President Carter. ``I leave the
public part of it to public officials,'' she says.
   In fact, Mrs. Bush says a certain independence has been her
secret to a happy marriage. ``We have shared but we have not
interfered in each other's life,'' she said.
   If she and her husband differ over a political issue, she won't
talk about it publicly anymore. In 1980, she told an interviewer
that her husband ``has always been against gun control'' while she
had favored gun control for years.
   Asked about that remark today, she replies: ``I must have been
younger and more foolish in 1980.''
   Interviewed on a flight to a welcome-home rally in her Rye, N.Y.,
hometown a few days before her husband's election, Mrs. Bush said it
will be ``a tough go'' living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, with the
inevitable public scrutiny and criticism of her family.
   She's disappointed, too, that she'll have to abandon those
early-morning walks in her bathrobe with their springer spaniel,
Millie, which she enjoyed on the spacious, secluded grounds of the
vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory.
   Despite her trepidation over being first lady, Mrs. Bush, 63,
says ``the pluses outweight the minuses.''
   She says it will give her a chance to travel, meet world leaders
and promote her favorite causes, chiefly literacy and involving the
private sector in Head Start and other educational programs for poor
children and their families.
   She won't be another Nancy Reagan, rail-thin, smooth-skinned and
perfectly coiffed.
   Mrs. Bush prefers a lacquer-free style, wears the lightest of
makeup, eats heartily, laughs boisterously and enjoys a joke, often
at her own expense.
   Asked if she'll accept dresses loaned by American designers _ a
practice that landed Mrs. Reagan in hot water _ Mrs. Bush replied:
   ``Listen, if anyone ever offered me anything, I would be beside
myself with excitement. ... You know they don't offer them to people
my size.''
   She says she sticks to three or four designers because it's too
much trouble to shop for clothes elsewhere.
   The vice president, who calls his fun-loving wife ``Bar,''
credits her with helping him win the election.
   ``She's become a star out there,'' Bush said recently. ``She's
very natural and people identify with her.'' He said her advice to
him is the same she gives everyone: ``Be yourself. Don't try to be
someone you're not.''
   Mrs. Bush insists she hasn't really changed since she married
Bush in 1945, and ``I don't think I'm going to change'' in the White
House. ``I've always run the house, taken care of the children,
taken care of my grandchildren and worked hard for the causes I'm
interested in,'' she said.
   Over the years, the Bushes have lived in 17 cities and 28 homes
as her husband moved from Yale University student to Navy pilot,
Texas oilman, congressman, U.N. ambassador, Republican national
chairman, U.S. envoy to China, CIA director and president.
   Along the way, they raised five children, four sons and a
daughter, and lost a 3-year-old girl to leukemia. All the Bush
offspring are grown and married. The youngest is 29.
   There are 10 Bush grandchildren, one of whom lives close enough
to visit frequently. She is Marshall, 2, daughter of son Marvin Bush
and his wife, Margaret, of suburban Alexandria, Va.
   Reared in the bosom of privilege, the former Barbara Pierce grew
up in Rye, a well-heeled suburb of New York City, as daughter of the
head of McCall Publishing Co.
   The third of four children, she met her future husband at a
Christmas dance at Rye. She was 16 and home for the holidays from
Ashley Hall, a posh private boarding school for girls in Charleston,
S.C. He was 17, a student at Phillips Academy at Andover, Mass.,
whose home was in nearby Greenwich, Conn.
   While Bush served a fighter pilot in the Pacific in World War II,
Barbara Pierce attended Smith College, Mrs. Reagan's alma mater. She
dropped out after two years to get married.
   Like Mrs. Reagan, she is fiercely protective of her husband and
reacts harshly to criticism of him.
   She terms ``very hurtful, sick'' and ``asinine' a rumor floated
publicly by a campaign aide to Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis
that Bush had a sexual affair with one of his assistants. The
Dukakis aide resigned over the remark.
   Mrs. Reagan spent about $1 million reburbishing the public rooms
of the White House in 1981, and Mrs. Bush has no plans to change
anything when she moves in next January.
   ``The china has just been changed so that is not a worry for the
next president and his wife,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I'm not planning to
leave my mark, the mark is there.''
   The Bushes, however, will receive $50,000 in tax funds to
redecorate the private living quarters at the White House.

   A small commuter plane carrying 12 people made a
belly landing this morning at Mitchell Airport, but no one was hurt,
officials said.
   The Northwest Airlink plane with 10 passengers and two crew
members landed with its gear up, said airport operations coordinator
Kathy David.
   Two passengers reported seeing a wheel fall off on takeoff from
Grand Rapids, Mich., while another reported seeing a tire blow out
on the British Aerospace Jetstream 31 turboprop.
   David Lowe, director of marketing for Express Airlines I of
Atlanta, the operator of Northwest Airlink, said only that there was
a problem with the left landing gear.
   The FAA was investigating, said George Marinos, a spokesman for
Northwest Airlines.

<HEAD>U.S. To Help Soviets Pick Mars Landing Site For Robot Craft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA has agreed to help pick a landing site on
Mars for a robot craft that the Soviets will launch in 1994,
American and Soviet scientists announced Thursday at a joint news
conference.
   Samuel W. Keller, the head of the NASA delegation that has been
negotiating with Soviet scientists, said that the Soviets have
picked four candidate landing sites after the United States provided
detailed maps of the Martian surface.
   Keller said the Soviets have now asked for more data and details
on the candidate sites.
   He made the comment at a news conference marking the end of a
week of negotiations between representatives of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and a delegation representing
the Soviet solar system exploration program. The two groups met to
work out areas of cooperation.
   Academician Valeriy L. Barsukov, head of the Soviet delegation,
said that the four candidate Mars landing sites are all located
within 30 degrees of the equator, but he declined to be more
specific.
   NASA accumulated a vast amount of detailed images and maps of
Mars during Viking spacecraft missions between 1975 and 1980. The
Viking program put two craft in orbit of Mars and two on the surface.
   The Soviets plan to launch a spacecraft in 1994 that will orbit
Mars and drop a lander that will scoop up soil and return it to
Earth.
   Barsukov said that in picking a landing site the Soviets are
considering such issues as a search for water and life, getting
comprehensive samples of the geology, and gaining insights into the
Martian evolution.
   Keller said other agreements reached during negotiations this
week included:
   _Using the American Deep Space Network to help track and
communicate with Soviet Mars probes.
   _An exchange of scientific personnel for work on specific
missions.
   _An exchange of data on Venus, a planet extensively explored by
both countries. Keller said the U.S.-Soviet studies are being
combined to produce four detailed maps.
   _An exchange of lunar material gathered by the Apollo program for
meteorite material collected by the Soviets.
   _An exchange of scientific instruments for use on planetary
probes.
   Barsukov said that the Soviets feel that a manned Mars landing is
``inevitable'' and that it probably will take place in the middle of
the next century.
   But before a manned mission to Mars is attempted, Barsukov said
there probably will be new manned flights to the moon. He declined
to elaborate.

<HEAD>FBI Looking at Possible Federal Violations in Connection with
Computer Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions said today the
bureau is looking at a wide range of possible federal violations in
connection with the criminal probe of the computer virus incident,
which revolves around a 23-year-old Cornell University graduate
student.
   At a news conference, Sessions said investigators are trying to
determine whether statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief
or unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken.
   Earlier, the bureau had said it was focusing on a federal law
that prohibits fraud or related activity in connection with
computers, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
   Sessions also said the preliminary phase of the criminal
investigation probably will be completed in the next two weeks.
   Cornell student Robert T. Morris has told friends that he created
the computer virus that disabled thousands of computers last week,
but didn't intend for it to invade computer systems around the
country.
   ``We often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doing
of an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids it
to be done,'' Sessions said. ``But we also have other statutes which
deal simply with knowingly doing something.''
   The malicious mischief statute which Sessions referred to
provides a maximum 10-year prison term for anyone who wilfully
interferes with the use of any communications line controlled by the
U.S. government.
   The unlawful access law which the FBI director referred to makes
it a crime to prevent authorized access to electronic communications
while they are in electronic storage and carries a maximum six-month
jail term absent malicious destruction or damage.

<TEXT>
   The Washington political correspondent of
Atlanta's two major newspapers has quit over the resignation of
editor Bill Kovach.
   John Mashek said he sent his two-weeks' notice by express mail
Tuesday. Glenn McCutchen, managing editor, confirmed today that
Mashek had resigned.
   Kovach was named editor of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution in 1986 in what was seen as an attempt to enhance the
papers' national stature. But the former Washington bureau chief of
The New York Times resigned last week in a dispute with the
newspapers' management.
   Mashek told USA Today that he was leaving because of Kovach's
departure.
   ``We were on the way to building something great,'' he said.
``Now that dream has been shattered.''
   More than 150 authors, community activists and journalists
deplored Kovach's departure in a full-page advertisement in today's
editions of the newspapers.
   ``We greatly appreciate the kind of excellence Mr. Kovach strove
for and helped to produce, and we are concerned that the ready
acceptance of his resignation signals a compromise of the high
journalistic standards we have come to expect,'' the statement said.
   Among those whose names appeared in the advertisement were
novelist Pat Conroy, author of ``The Water is Wide,'' ``Conrack''
and ``Lords of Discipline,'' and Bill Emerson, former editor of The
Saturday Evening Post.
   Also included was John Lewis, the city's congressman.

<HEAD>Mothers of Vietnam War Dead Find Courage To Help Vets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years have passed since their
sons' flag-draped coffins came home aboard a U.S. cargo plane from
Vietnam, but for Polly Dixon and Evelyn Barbour, the grieving goes
on.
   The deaths of their sons brought the two women together in 1969,
and together, they have found the strength to help the men who
survived the troubling war their boys didn't.
   One day a week, they become the ``moms'' of the city's Vietnam
Veterans Outreach Center, answering telephones, making coffee and
sitting in the lobby to talk to anyone who comes in while the
counseling group is in session.
   ``It's really been a lifeline for me,'' Mrs. Dixon said. ``I have
a lot of compassion for these guys and they relate to us because
they understand our pain. A lot of them have parents who are dead.''
   The women first visited the center three years ago and decided to
volunteer. The center, which opened in 1982, is one of 189
nationwide and has served 2,200 Vietnam veterans in its six years.
   ``I still feel out of everything bad that happens to you, you can
find some good if you look for it,'' Mrs. Dixon said. ``And I didn't
happen to find any good out of his (her son Roger's) death until 17
years later, which is the vet center.''
   Mrs. Barbour also credits the center with helping her cope. She
said she'll go to her grave grieving for her son Jimmy, ``and if it
hadn't been for this center, I'd probably be there now.''
   She has adopted the center's veterans as her sons, and they call
her mom. They've laughed with her, cried with her, laid their heads
on her shoulder.
   ``When they say, `Mom, it's rough; he was my brother,' you feel
like it's a family and you feel like he's got to come walking in
here soon.''
   But the place where they feel closest to their sons is the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, and on Friday, the two
women will make their annual Veterans Day pilgrimage to it.
   The first trip to the wall, after it was dedicated six years ago,
was overwhelming for Mrs. Dixon.
   ``When you look up there and see all those names,'' she said.
``All I could think about was all of the pain that all of those
parents and wives and families, as well as myself, were still trying
to deal with.
   ``People don't understand. They think because a boy's been dead
20 years that you're supposed to bury him and forget that he
existed. You can't do that. It's impossible to do that.''
   Each time she goes, Mrs. Dixon leaves a letter for Roger at the
base of the wall.
   The youngest of Mrs. Dixon's three children and her second son to
serve in Vietnam, Roger was 19 when he was drafted into the 25th
Infantry Division on June 11, 1968.
   Forty-four days after his arrival in Tay Ninh, Roger was on
patrol. An American platoon mistook Roger's group for Viet Cong and
set off a mine. Roger was hit in the back, the abdomen, both legs
and one arm. Four others were killed instantly. He hung on for eight
hours.
   At the outreach center, said Mrs. Dixon, ``I don't talk about the
Vietnam part of his life, unless they ask me what happened to him. I
talk about the living part of his life,'' his love of basketball,
his desire to make people laugh.
   Jimmy Barbour, the elder of two boys, had always talked about
jumping, his mother recalled, but that didn't lessen her shock when
he walked in the door one day and announced he had joined the
paratroopers. He did well, collecting 14 medals and citations that
his mother keeps in a wood and glass case.
   Barbour was in the service 10 months and three days when he
caught a bullet in the neck Aug. 27, 1968, while pulling wounded out
of the way of enemy fire in Cu Chi northwest of Saigon.
   Mrs. Barbour received 14 shock treatments and was in and out of
the hospital for 2{ years.
   ``People wouldn't believe how close we were, how happy we were,''
she said, showing a family portrait of a smiling foursome: Mrs.
Barbour, her Air Force sergeant husband, Jimmy and her younger son,
Wayne.
   ``Sometimes I'd like to stand on a big mountain and say, `Love
them.' It's so easy to put your arms around them and tell them you
love them. But try going and putting flowers on their graves.''

   Final results from the American
Samoa election show Republican Peter Tali Coleman with an 830-vote
victory for the governorship.
   Coleman had 5,768 votes; incumbent Democrat A. P. Lutali had
4,958.
   Coleman was the first Samoan to be appointed the territory's
governor. He was the territory's first elected governor.
   Coleman was appointed territorial governor in 1956, was first
elected governor in 1977 and won re-election in 1980. The
territorial constitution barred him from seeking a third term in
1984, when Lutali was elected.
   In the congressional delegate race, a runoff election is
scheduled for Nov. 22 because none of the four candidates received
the necessary 51 percent of the vote.
   Lt. Gov. Faleomavaega Eni Hunkin had 3,739 votes, and Sen. Tufele
Li'a had 3,381 votes. The other candidates were far behind.
   The winner of the runoff election will succeed Fofo Sunia, who
resigned in September after he was convicted of defrauding the U.S.
government in a payroll padding scheme.

   Marilyn Quayle is the quintessential suburban
mother involved in PTA, Little League and school plays. But she is
also a lawyer with steely determination, who induced labor for her
first child so she could take the bar exam.
   Bright and ambitious, the wife of Vice President-elect Dan Quayle
had made no secret of her desire to return to work and pursue her
own career this fall after more than a decade of postponing it for
motherhood. Whether that's now possible _ being a Washington lawyer
who is also the vice president's wife _ remains to be seen.
   But at 39, Mrs. Quayle sees herself as part of the ``vanguard of
the future'' for women of her generation, the first ``brought up to
think that women shouldn't just look to get married, that you should
have a career.''
   ``There's no door closed. We've all realized that there's no set
role that a woman has to take. And I can look at every opportunity
and decide what's best for me without thinking of what is expected
of me,'' she said in a recent interview.
   A lot was expected of her during the campaign, and Mrs. Quayle
said she was ``pushed hard'' by ``having as much attention drawn to
me.''
   Republican strategists saw her as a weapon against the
controversy that sometimes surrounded her husband. Quayle sometimes
garbled his words and was flustered at tough questions. She was
always cool and prepared. He did no major television interviews. She
did ``20@20'' soon after the campaign began.
   Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant who worked with the
campaign, says Mrs. Quayle was viewed as someone who was better able
to communicate with working women through ``shared experience and
values'' than was her husband ``with all of his reputed good looks.''
   Mrs. Quayle traveled the country on her own vigorous campaign
schedule. Inevitably, her crisp professional performance provoked
comments, only half in jest, that she should be the vice
presidential nominee.
   Rumor also put her in line for her husband's Senate seat when he
resigns. Insiders view that as unlikely, although Mrs. Quayle
doesn't put an end to such speculation.
   ``I'll cross that bridge when I come to it,'' she told one
interviewer.
   Marilyn Tucker was born in Indianpolis, the daughter of two
physicians, Warren and Mary Alice Tucker. The family left the local
Presbyterian church for the teachings of Col. Robert Thieme, a Texas
preacher known for unorthodox biblical interpretations and for
verbal attacks on liberals, welfare recipients, homosexuals and
others.
   Mrs. Quayle, a fundamentalist, admires Thieme for his
interpretation of the Bible from original Greek, Hebrew and Latin
versions. She says she has no knowledge of his political
pronouncements. The family attends a Virginia church that is part of
the conservative Presbyterian Church in America.
   The couple met while attending Indiana University Law School and,
she says, ``swept each other off our feet.'' They were married 10
weeks later. They have three children, Tucker, Benjamin and Corinne.
   Mrs. Quayle says she induced labor in 1974 so she could deliver
in time to take the Indiana bar exam. Her doctor, ``figured out
exactly how many days before the bar exam I would be able to have
Tucker and still be able to sit through two days of the exam,'' she
said.
   She doesn't consider that unusual, adding that ``all my other
kids were induced.''
   The Quayles set up a law practice above the newspaper run by
Quayle's father in Huntington, Ind. Mrs. Quayle did most of the
lawyering while her husband was associate publisher. After his
election to Congress in 1976, she continued to work. She soon
stopped to become a fulltime mother but not to sit home ``eating bon
bons and watching the soaps.''
   ``Whether it's working with study groups and doing research _ I
do quite a bit of speaking _ I've managed to be able to contribute
quite a bit, I think, in all different areas,'' she said.
   She is one of her husband's top advisers. Early in the campaign
she was quite protective, tugging on his sleeve to pull him away
from the press. She criticizes the media for what she says is a
liberal bias and for scrutiny of her husband's military service,
academic record and personal life.
   But resentment, she says, ``isn't part of my life.'' She says she
is not bitter, for example, that her career may once again be put on
hold by her husband's vice presidency.
   ``Why be unhappy? Take every opportunity you have to make the
best out of the situation. You don't stew on things that might have
been.''

   An explosion today trapped three workmen in a
sewer tunnel under construction, and dangerous levels of methane gas
forced rescuers to turn back, the Fire Department said. The workers'
condition was not immediately known.
   Deputy Chief Orville Peterson said the men were trapped
approximately 2,000 feet into the tunnel and about 40 feet below the
surface.
   Rescuers awaited equipment to remove the methane, a byproduct of
decomposition believed responsible for the explosion, and pump in
fresh air.
   ``It's too hazardous for anyone to go in at this time,''
Battalion Chief Norm Luedke said. ``With one little spark we will
have another explosion.''
   It was not immediately known how long it would take for the
equipment to arrive. Luedke declined to say whether the workers were
still alive.
   Luedke, head of the department's tunnel rescue unit, said two
rescuers went about 1,200 feet into the tunnel but turned back after
detecting methane levels of 6 percent. He said a reading above 4
percent is considered dangerous.
   Patrick Doig, project manager for the contractor S.A. Healy Co.,
said 10 men were in the tunnel when a detection device showed high
levels of methane.
   All of the men left the tunnel, he said, and then three went back
in to check gas levels. That was when the explosion occurred, he
said.
   The tunnel, part of a $2.1 billion project to expand the city's
sewage treatment and collection program, will be used to store
untreated sewage. It is not yet connected to the existing sewer
system.
   Methane is formed by the decomposition of organic matter and is
found in sewers, mines and marshes.

<TEXT>
   Declaring an independent
Palestinian state will not change the reality of Israeli occupation,
but many Palestinians see the implied recognition of Israel as a
possible step toward peace.
   After 11 months of revolt in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in
which more than 300 of them have been killed, Palestinians are
frustrated that Israel already has rejected the declaration expected
at a weekend meeting of the Palestine National Council.
   They hope, however, that basing the declaration on a 1947 U.N.
resolution that calls for Arab and Jewish states in Palestine will
convince Western public opinion the Palestine Liberation
Organization wants to negotiate peace.
   The PLO has called on the Palestine National Council, which meets
Saturday in Algiers, to declare an independent state in the occupied
lands. The Arab League created the 450-member council 24 years ago
to serve as the Palestinian legislature and not all its members
belong to the PLO.
   Dr. Hatem Abu Ghazala, a prominent pro-PLO Palestinian in Nablus,
said: ``I do not take this declaration as merchandise to be sold to
Israel. I am selling this idea to European and American public
opinion.''
   He said he hopes Western nations, especially the United States,
will bring pressure on Israel to begin peace talks when the PLO has
softened its position.
   ``This is something new,'' he said. ``No longer is the PLO
denying the existence of Israel. A Palestinian state declared
through the PLO will recognize the willingness of the PLO to go to a
peace conference with the Israelis.''
   Basing the independence declaration on U.N. General Assembly
Resolution 181 of 1947 could be interpreted as implicit recognition
of Israel, but that probably will not satisfy conditions Israel and
the United States have set for dealing directly with the PLO.
   The 1968 PLO Covenant calling for armed struggle and destruction
of the Jewish state is another element in U.S. and Israeli
opposition to direct dealings. Some Palestinians say the PLO can get
around that by having a provisional government write a constitution
to replace the Covenant.
   Israel's Nov. 1 parliamentary elections were indecisive but
seemed to give the edge in forming a government to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc.
   Shamir, who opposes trading occupied land for peace, has said
Israel would never accept a Palestinian state and a declaration of
independence would be an obstacle to peace because the Arabs would
have difficulty backing down from it.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the rival Labor Party had
instructions sent to Israeli diplomats saying PLO recognition of the
U.N. partition plan was irrelevant because of the Arab attack on
Israel in 1948.
   Haidar Abdul-Shafi, head of the Gaza Strip's Red Crescent
Society, the Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, said it would be a
mistake to extend direct recognition to Israel without something in
return.
   ``We are declaring we accept the two-state formula, but there's a
limit,'' he said. ``Should we be expected to go farther, to
acknowledge Israel when it claims all of the land?''
   Support for the PLO approach is far from universal among the 1.5
Palestinians of the occupied territories.
   The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas (Zeal) declared in in a
leaflet distributed Thursday: ``If you sign an agreement with the
Jews, in whose name do you speak? No for the Zionist state in the
land of Palestine. Yes to the armed struggle.''
   Other Palestinians want direct recognition of Israel, contending
that would strengthen the political initiative provided by the
uprising.
   On a street in Nablus where anti-Israeli graffiti covered the
walls, 27-year-old tailor Nasser Atoud said: ``The PNC should make
decisions which serve our interests. If they don't take a decision
to clearly recognize Israel, all the suffering will be in vain.''
   Daoud Kuttab, a leading Palestinian journalist, said: ``A
declaration of independence will give people hope. ... It encourages
people to keep going.''

<TEXT>
   The Future Farmers of America has voted
to take ``farmers'' out of its name because the word was hurting
recruiting.
   Delegates at the 61st annual convention of the Future Farmers of
America voted with little debate Wednesday to rename the group the
National FFA Organization.
   FFA officers and U.S. Education Department advisers to the
organization had recommended the name change to help stop a 23
percent decline in membership since the mid-1970s. The FFA has some
416,000 active members nationwide.
   FFA is open to students interested in agriculture or related
fields, such as agricultural economy, farm equipment technology and
agribusiness.
   Local chapters will be permitted to use the old name if they
prefer.
   The organization's 113-member legislative body also voted to
strip the words ``vocational agriculture'' from the FFA symbol,

   The delegates also voted to offer FFA membership, now confined to
high school and college students, to seventh and eighth graders.

<HEAD>Farm Lawmakers Assail Reagan for Nutrition Veto</HEAD>

   Farm lawmakers said Thursday that President
Reagan's veto of a nutrition monitoring bill was ``unfortunate and
unnecessary'' and vowed to push for passage again when Congress
reconvenes.
   ``The president's veto of nutrition monitoring legislation on
election day is astonishing,'' said a statement from the House and
Senate Agriculture Committees and nine other lawmakers, including
two Republicans.
   The bill vetoed Wednesday by Reagan called for a 10-year
assessment of the health and well-being of Americans and the
American diet with special focus on the elderly, pregnant women,
infants, children and the homeless.
   Under the bill, the secretaries of agriculture and health and
human services would have reviewed in advance any federal advice to
consumers on what and what not to eat. The provision was designed to
make the federal government speak with one voice on nutrition and
safety issues.
   ``We believe the veto of this legislation was unfortunate and
necessary,'' the statement said. ``We will press for passage of this
legislation at the outset of the 101st Congress,'' which meets in
January.
   Reagan said in vetoing the measure that the ``administration
strongly supports the principal goals of this legislation and
reaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve these
ends.''
   He said in a statement, however, that ``enactment of the bill
would set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course.''
   ``The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the
bill's goals,'' Reagan said.
   The congressional statement was signed by Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and House Agriculture
Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, as well as
Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Jeff Bingaman,
D-Ariz.; and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Reps. Robert Roe, D-N.J.;
George Brown, D-Calif.; Leon Panetta, D-Calif.; Doug Walgren, D-Pa.,
and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.
   Their statement quoted Scott Balin, American Heart Association
vice president and legislative counsel, as saying: ``The president's
veto of (the bill) does a serious disservice to the health and
welfare of the American people.''
   ``We concur,'' the lawmakers said.

<HEAD>Report Denounces Staff Response to Deadly Fire; Top Men Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report Thursday blamed executive complacency and
an ``uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained'' staff response in last
year's subway fire that killed 31 people in the London Underground's
worst tragedy.
   The transit system's top two executives resigned as the report
was released eight days before the first anniversary of the Nov. 18,
1987, fire that erupted in busy King's Cross station in the heart of
the capital.
   Sir Keith Bright, chairman of London Regional Transport that
controls the London Underground, resigned Wednesday night and Tony
Ridley, London Underground's chairman and chief executive, quit
Thursday.
   The blaze, at the end of evening rush hour, was the worst
accident in the 120-year history of the system.
   Among the points made by Desmond Fennell, the lawyer who headed
the 91-day investigation:
   _ The fire was caused by a lighted match falling through a gap
beside escalator treads. It ignited grease and fluff on the
escalator tracks and funneled flames upward to a ticketing plaza
that became an inferno.
   _ Staff at King's Cross were ``woefully ill-equipped,'' never
applying a drop of water or using a single fire extinguisher.
``Their overall response may be characterized as uncoordinated,
haphazard and untrained,'' and there was ``a general failure to
appreciate the severity of the disaster.''
   _ London Underground was ``lulled into a false sense of security
because no previous escalator fire had caused a death.'' Its
``blinkered approach'' held that ``fires were inevitable on the
oldest and most extensive underground system in the world.''
   _ Management had ``a blind spot over the hazards of fire on
escalators,'' and had a rule, withdrawn only after the blaze, always
to refer to fires as ``smolderings.''
   Fennell wrote that London Underground had no system for training
staff in fire drill or evacuation.
   The report said Bright was ``mistaken as to his responsibility''
over his board's failure to monitor safety as strictly as it
monitored its finances.
   The management had failed to put a high priority on safety
because no one was in overall charge of the matter. Annual fire
brigade inspections, conducted at London Underground's invitation,
were inadequate, the report said.
   London Underground's management, under Ridley, was
``fundamentally in error'' in regarding fires as inevitable, it said.
   The report made 157 recommendations for the biggest shakeup the
transit system has known. They ranged from organizational changes to
physical measures such as removing wood paneling and installing TV
monitors and smoke detectors.
   Ridley, in a resignation statement, called the report ``an
emotive document'' but did not criticize it outright.
   Bright made no comment, but Transport Secretary Paul Channon, who
ordered the inquiry, said the 57-year-old executive had offered to
resign immediately after the fire ``but I asked him to stay during a
difficult period and he did.''
   He promised the government would act on the report's
recommendations as ``quickly and as vigorously as possible.'' He
said $476 million would be spent over the next three years to make
stations safer.
   But the opposition Labor Party sought to fix the blame on the
ruling Conservative Party, saying its budget-cutting doctrines
pressured London Underground into cutting corners on safety in order
to reduce its dependency on government subsidies.
   Families of the dead are considering a private prosecution of the
management.
   Sophie Tarassenko, whose brother, Ivan, perished, said she felt
relief when she read the report.
   ``It has been a furstrating 12 months where everyone seemed to be
washing their hands of the whole business,'' she said. ``We are glad
the report names names and we think it was right for Sir Keith
Bright and Dr. Tony Ridley to resign.''

   Moves to unify Europe should not be feared as
threats to the special character of countries like France or
Britain, Prince Charles said Thursday.
   ``Certain worries have been expressed about the uniformity that
could result from the single market,'' Britain's heir to the throne
told a luncheon sponsored by the Franco-British Chamber of Commerce.
``I don't believe the French, nor the English, have very much to
fear in that direction.''
   Charles, making a five-day official visit to France with his
wife, Princess Diana, said taking down trade barriers ``will not
wipe out geography, language, culture. I'm glad.''
   The 10 nations of the European Economic Community have agreed to
eliminate barriers to free movement of people, goods, services and
capital by the end of 1992.
   On the fourth day of their visit, Charles and Diana also visited
the Paris branch of the British department store Marks and Spencer
and the nearby French menswear store Madelios.

   Nobel Peace Prize winners Mother
Teresa and Archbishop Desmond Tutu had a reunion Thursday at a
reception for the 78-year-old nun, who is establishing a mission for
the poor in a black township.
   ``It's a good thing that she's here, anything that brings people
together and highlights some of our squalor and poverty in a country
as developed and wealthy as this,'' Tutu said.
   Since she arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, Mother Teresa has
refused to comment on apartheid, the country's system of racial
separation. She said her purpose is to provide food, clothing,
shelter and care ``to the poorest of the poor.''
   On Thursday morning, she approved a site in the black township of
Khayelitsha for the mission, which will be run by four nuns she
brought with her.
   At the reception, the founder of the Missionaries of Charity and
the Anglican cleric reminisced about their meeting several years ago
in Paris at a human rights conference.

   Medals awarded to war hero Peter Townsend,
romantically linked to Princess Margaret in the 1950s, were sold
Thursday to a Canadian collector, Sotheby's auction house said.
   Townsend, a former group captain, was the first Royal Air Force
fighter pilot to destroy a German aircraft over England in World War
II, downing a Heinkel III in his Hurricane on Feb. 3, 1940, near
Whitby, Yorkshire.
   Townsend was not present at the sale, which netted $39,380. He
lives at Le Perray-en-Yvelines in France and said he wanted money to
launch a fund to help children who have suffered in wars.
   His original flying log books were sold with the 12 medals, which
included a Royal Victorian Order, Distinguished Service Order,
Distinguished Flying Cross and decorations from Denmark and the
Netherlands.
   Townsend, who will be 74 on Nov. 22, described the 1940 air
fights of the Battle of Britain as the ``greatest spiritual and
human experience of my life.''
   He served later as an aide to King George VI and at Buckingham
Palace he met the monarch's younger daughter, Princess Margaret.
They fell in love but as Townsend was divorced, pressure was brought
on Margaret not to marry him and she publicly renounced him in
November 1955.

   Though on NBC's ``Golden Girls'' she lives with
three other women, actress Betty White says in real life, ``I could
no more dream of living with other women than sitting on the moon in
a spaceship.''
   ``I'm with people too much of the time, and my greatest luxury is
knowing I can spend the whole day alone not watching the clock,''
White told US magazine.
   The actress lives in Brentwood, Calif., alone except for her
three dogs: Dinah, Timothy and Cricket.
   White, 66, who was married to game show host Allen Ludden for 18
years before his 1982 death from cancer, said she believes a person
can find love more than once in a lifetime. But, she added, ``at
this point in my life, I don't need marriage.''
   ``The beauty of this day and age is that I can go away with a man
for the weekend or he can come to my house _ and nobody thinks
anything about it,'' she said. ``That kind of freedom is marvelous.''

   Justine and Jason Bateman both agree the ``Family
Ties'' star gives her younger brother plenty of advice _ they just
disagree on how it's presented.
   ``She always gives me advice about things I already know. In
fact, she gets pretty motherly,'' Jason, the teen-age star of ``The
Hogan Family,'' says in US magazine. ``I let it go through one ear
and out the other.''
   But 22-year-old Justine says her words of wisdom are those of a
friend, not a mom.
   ``We're very connected. So if I tell him something, it's not
because I'm his big sister, but because I'm someone who's known him
all his life,'' she said.
   Jason adds that Justine has one more motherly attribute: She
likes to keep a close watch on his dates.
   ``She's pretty judgmental about the girls I date. I think she
sort of thinks the ones I choose are beneath me,'' said Jason. ``But
I've never had a problem with the guys she dated.''

   The percentage of new U.S. military recruits with
AIDS infections is decreasing, apparently because more men who fear
they may be infected aren't signing up, federal health officials
said Thursday.
   In the first six months of the military's testing program for the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, beginning in October 1985, 15
out of every 10,000 recruits were found to show signs of AIDS virus
infection.
   However, between October 1987 and March 1988, 12 in every 10,000
recruits were infected, the national Centers for Disease Control
reported.
   ``Our leading hypothesis is that it reflects self-deferral among
high-risk applicants _ people who know they have (AIDS virus)
infections, or suspect they might be at increased risk, are not
coming into the recruitment centers,'' said Dr. Marta Gwinn, an AIDS
specialist with the Atlanta-based CDC.
   One reason researchers believe high-risk recruits may be staying
away is that although there has been a ``statistically significant
decrease'' in AIDS infection among male recruits, infection rates
among female recruits _ who may be less likely to think they are
infected _ have stayed largely constant, the CDC said in its weekly
report.
   The rate of AIDS infection among male recruits has dropped from
17 per 10,000 in initial testing to 12 in the latest numbers, while
the rate for female recruits has risen from seven per 10,000 to
eight.
   ``Women may be less aware of their risk for ... infection,'' the
CDC said. Only 9 percent of all U.S. AIDS cases have occurred in
females; homosexual or bisexual males account for 68 percent.
   The military has tested more than 1.5 million recruits for AIDS
infection. More than 2,100, or 0.1 percent, have tested positive.
Federal health officials estimate that about 0.6 percent of the U.S.
population is infected with the AIDS virus.
   Although AIDS infection rates are lower among military recruits
than the public _ largely because gay men and drug users are subject
to exclusion from military service _ the military test results are
still of interest to researchers, Ms. Gwinn said.
   ``If the incidence of infection were to decline, we might detect
it first in the youngest age groups,'' she said, noting that
military recruits tend to be in their late teens or early 20s.
   ``Were we to see a dramatic decline in the youngest age group, it
would be potentially encouraging,'' she added. ``That is not what is
happening at the present time, though.''

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Flat as Food Costs Show First Decline in Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last
month as food costs dropped for the first time since February,
reflecting an easing of the effects of the summer drought, the
government said Thursday.
   Fresh-fruit prices plummeted 9.2 percent to lead a 0.1 percent
decline in food prices on the wholesale level, the Labor Department
said. Large drops also occurred in prices for vegetables, pasta,
fish, beef, pork and cooking oils. Food prices had been climbing at
an annual rate of 8 percent before the reversal.
   While the turnaround indicated the initial effects of the driest
summer in decades on food prices are over, analysts said consumers
can expect a second round of drought-related increases next spring
when shortages of meat and pork appear because of
earlier-than-normal slaughters this year.
   ``It's just temporary,'' said Michael Evans, who runs a private
economic forecasting firm in Washington. ``Next year we'll see the
lag effects of the drought and food prices will be up sharply
again.''
   Wholesale prices increases for food have totaled 4.5 percent over
the past 12 months, paralleling the rate of consumer price inflation
in general. But including energy and other products, wholesale
prices overall are only 2.9 percent above a year ago.
   ``International competition is still forcing the industrial
sector to fight cost increases ever more vigorously,'' said Cynthia
Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   ``There was a bunch of aberrations last month that added up to
zero, and that certainly is good news,'' Ms. Latta said. ``But I
don't think we should stop worrying about inflation.''
   Energy prices rose a slight 0.3 percent in October as a 4.6
percent increase in natural gas prices caused primarily by shortages
in the Northeast was offset by a 10.1 percent decline in home
heating oil prices and no change in gasoline prices.
   Energy prices are still 5.7 percent below what they were a year
ago, and analysts said they expect them to begin falling again by
spring.
   Before the seasonal adjustments, the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index for all finished goods _ including energy and food _
rose 0.6 percent to 109.3.
   That means that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 at
the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $109.30 last month. The
same basket of goods would have cost $108.60 in September and
$107.70 a year ago.
   The seasonal adjustment process is designed to remove
predictable, periodic influences from the calculation of price
changes.
   Analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjusted
prices and real ones was primarily connected with the introduction
of 1989-model automobiles.
   After the seasonal adjustments, which are intended to spread out
the effect of auto price hikes associated with the introduction of
new 1989 models, new car prices fell 1.7 percent.
   ``The introduction of new models are strung out now instead of
being lumped into September and October and the seasonal adjustments
don't reflect the changes as well as they used to,'' said Ms. Latta.
   The Labor Department estimated the value of quality changes in
the new 1989 models _ such as government-mandated passive
restraints, new corrosion protection and improvements in power
trains _ at $153.69 per vehicle, or 34.6 percent of the average
$444.08 increase in price to dealers.
   Alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.6 percent on the wholesale level
last month after declining by 0.3 percent in September, the Labor
Department said.
   Women's and men's apparel costs were up 0.1 percent and 0.2
percent, respectively, while prices for children's clothing fell 0.3
percent after rising 0.6 percent in the back-to-school buying month
of September.
   Prescription drug prices rose 0.4 percent and were 9.3 percent
above what they were a year earlier. Cosmetics rose 0.5 percent on
October but were only 2.9 percent higher than during the same month
in 1987.
   Household furniture prices rose 0.8 percent last month and were
4.5 percent above what they were a year ago. Including a 0.5 percent
decline last month, wholesale prices for household appliances have
risen only 0.7 percent in the last year.
   Also pacing the slight drop in food costs last month were
declines of 1.9 percent for fresh vegetables, 5.8 percent for pasta,
0.9 percent for fish, 4.0 percent for cooking oils and 1.6 percent
for beef and pork.
   Offsetting them were increases of 1.9 percent for processed
chickens, 8.0 percent for turkeys, 7.3 percent for eggs and 1.0
percent for canned fruits and vegetables.
   Prices for intermediate goods further back in the production
chain _ items such as plastic parts, cement, paints, fertilizers,
lumber and chemicals _ also were flat in October but 5.3 percent
higher than a year earlier.
   Raw material prices for crude products such as oil, agricultural
commodities, scrap aluminium, iron ore and timber declined 0.1
percent last month and are only 0.5 percent above what they were a
year ago, the Labor Department said.

   The opinion polls ended the presidential election
on a harmonious note: Most of them predicted the outcome fairly
accurately, if none precisely.
   The final pre-election polls did not hit the election's numbers
right on the head _ 54 percent to 46 percent for Republican George
Bush over Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   But they were close, with estimates of Bush's lead ranging from
four to 11 points. CBS News came nearest to the actual spread: Its
final national survey Tuesday morning found a 52-43 percent Bush
lead, a nine-point margin.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll was next closest, putting it at
10 points. And ABC pollsters won bragging rights on another score:
They exactly predicted Bush's total in their 54-44 percent estimate.
   Better than that, a huge 50-state ABC-Post poll done the week
before the election came extremely close to predicting Bush's total
in the electoral college. It put him ahead for 439 electoral votes;
he won 426.
   ``I'm very happy,'' said ABC's chief pollster, Jeff Alderman.
``We had a very, very good year.''
   Other polls were a tad farther off on the outcome. At one end of
the scale, Gallup had an 11-point Bush lead in its last poll, 53-42
percent, and a USA Today-CNN poll also had an 11-point Bush lead,
55-44.
   At the other end, an NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey
estimated a five-point Bush lead, 48-43, and the final Harris poll
had it at four, 51-47.
   Reasons for the disparity included the varying methods of
identifying who is most likely to vote, and also the pollsters'
efforts to apportion at least some of the voters who said they were
undecided or only leaning.
   Only Gallup was brave enough before the election to try an
estimate of how all its undecideds would vote; it arrived at a 56-44
percent result, a 12-point Bush margin. But even that estimate was
within the margin of sampling error of the outcome.
   ``We have a lot of people disappointed here that we didn't hit it
right on the nose. I said, God, every time you're within sampling
error you've done your job,'' said Gallup pollster Larry Hugick.
``Some of our people remember the last time, and they're spoiled.''
   The last time was the 1984 election, when Gallup, applying the
same methods, estimated a Ronald Reagan victory of 59-41 percent. He
won, 59-41.
   ``A certain part of this,'' said Hugick, ``is just luck.''

   Police detained 14 Czechoslovak dissidents
after raiding their homes, a human rights activist in Prague said
Thursday.
   The raids came before an independent symposium this weekend in
Prague on Czechoslovakia's history and political future.
   Anna Sabatova, a signatory to the Charter 77 human rights accord,
said police detained three dissidents late Wednesday and another 11
on Thursday.
   The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights in Vienna
issued a list of 15 people it said were arrested. All three Charter
77 spokesmen, Stanislav Devaty, Milos Hajek and Bohumir Janat,
appeared to be under arrest, according to various reports available
in Vienna.
   Libuse Silhanova, a key organizer of the symposium, and her
husband, Venek Silhan, were arrested outside their home Thursday
evening, according to the source.
   Milan Jungmann, a literary expert invited to address the
symposium, was picked up by police for questioning, according to an
emigre source in Vienna who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Those held Wednesday included activist Ladislav Lis and Sabata's
husband, Petr Uhl, as well as her father, Jaroslav Sabata, an
activist in the Moravian capital of Brno, the source said. Also
arrested, according to the same source, were Charter 77 signatory
Jiri Dienstbier and former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek.
   The source reported that Dienstbier and Uhl were later released,
and that Uhl pledged not to attend the symposium.
   The raids followed a police crackdown two weeks ago in which more
than 100 dissidents were detained to prevent them from attending a
rally in Prague on Oct. 28 marking 70 years of Czechoslovak
independence.
   In another development, 20 prominent intellectuals, including
several of those arrested, were reported Thursday to have set up a
Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee to support and publicize the 1975
Helsinki human rights accords and related documents.
   Banned playwright Vaclav Havel, chairman of the committee
organizing this weekend's symposium, was not detained, the Helsinki
Federation reported.
   The symposium was called by Charter 77, the Independent Peace
Association, the independent cultural group Jazz Section, the
Democratic Initiative and the Czechoslovakia-U.S. Friendship Society.
   The organizers invited foreign guests to attend the meeting,
which was planned for various Prague apartments.
   The Helsinki Federation says American writer Kurt Vonnegut and
Gerald Nagler, secretary-general of the International Helsinki
Federation for Human Rights, planned to participate.

   The 5-year-old bird abandoned his mate Violet on Monday morning,
possibly because he was unhappy about sharing his digs with the
kudu, an antelope. Or it could have been that Violet was ignoring
his mating overtures, in which he made ostentatious displays and
carried twigs to her. What's worse, zoo workers haven't even gotten
around to naming him.
   The bird spent the night in some nearby woods and returned home
Tuesday.
   Zoo Curator John Keeley said he was unsure ``if he came back
because of Violet, whether he was familiar with the area and wanted
to get back to the exhibit, or if our catching him was just dumb
luck.''
   The bird, which is two feet tall and has a bright orange face
with an eight-inch beak, was cornered by Keeler and his staff in
tall weeds along the zoo fence.
   Violet didn't seem terribly concerned about her mate's
disappearance, Keeley said.
   ``She didn't pace the yard, or seem upset that he left at all,''
he said.
   Now that the pair is together again, zoo officials hope the
winter cold will rekindle their courtship.
   ``We obviously want to get some breeding going,'' he said. ``So
we're going to try some different things next spring.''

   Band Director Richard Kruse was so proud of
his junior high school musicians that he put up $3,600 for a highway
billboard to trumpet their achievements.
   Kruse, a music teacher at Romulus Junior High School, spent his
own money to sing the band's praises to Interstate 94 motorists.
   The billboard displays a photograph of the band taken on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol last year during a Washington, D.C. tour.
   ``I'm just proud of these kids, and I thought they deserved some
recognition,'' said Kruse, 47, who has taught music at the school
for 23 years.
   The band has received prestigious rankings from the Michigan
School Band and Orchestra Association for the past nine years.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials Thursday threw their weight behind
efforts to stop fraud in the marketplace by crushing 17,000
counterfeit wristwatches with a steamroller.
   The fake Rolex, Patek Filippe, Corum, Concord and Piaget watches
_ further proof that all that glitters is not gold _ were flattened
into looping metallic pancakes.
   They were seized more than three years ago in a joint U.S.
Customs-Secret Service case codenamed ``Operation Stopwatch.''
   Customs officials believe more than $3 billion worth of
counterfeit goods are produced each year in Italy alone. Fake
designer leather goods and watches are among popular items. The
officials said Swiss watch manufacturers estimate more than 10
million counterfeit watches are sold worldwide each year.
   Customs officials said 26 people in South Florida were arrested,
tried, and convicted on fraud charges stemming from Operation
Stopwatch. Once final appeals in the case were completed, the 17,000
watches were ordered destroyed.
   The value of the watches _ even as fakes _ was put at more than
$620,000. Agents said the timepieces could be sold for $20 to $40
each in wholesale lots.

<TEXT>
   Two specialists from Zaire and Egypt says
they have developed a new form of their experimental treatment for
AIDS, which they plan to try on four American patients.
   The vaccine, named MM-2, was developed by Professor Zirimwabago
Lurhuma of Zaire and Professor Ahmed Shafik of Egypt, and has been
administered to animals in preliminary tests.
   The MM-2 is an improved version of their vaccine MM-1, without
its side-effects of MM-1, notably the pain and fever, Lurhuma told a
news conference Wednesday.
   It is to be tried shortly on a group of four American AIDS
patients who came specially from the United States for the
treatment, supervised by American specialists. The American patients
and doctors were not identified.
   Shafik said it was possible that other American patients would
come to Kinshasa soon to undergo the treatment.
   The treatment consists of about 20 injections spread over three
months, followed by a three-month rest period. At the end of the
rest period, many cases of remission had been observed, Lurhuma said.
   ``We want to let as much time go by as possible to judge the
effectiveness of the method,'' Lurhuma said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Dutch policemen took
to the streets Thursday to protest a government-proposed
restructuring of pay scales and what they claim amounts to a
nationwide manpower reduction.
   In Amsterdam alone, an estimated 1,500 members of the municipal
police force took part in a rush hour demonstration that caused
chaos in the city center, a police spokesman said.
   Action leaders also announced a 12-hour slowdown in law
enforcement, meaning that ``only the most serious cases will be
acted upon,'' according to spokesman Berry Wolven.
   Similar demonstrations involving another 1,000 policemen were
reported in Rotterdam, the world's largest port, and the southern
Dutch city of Tilburg.
   At issue is a government report proposing to restructure police
pay scales, which police unions claim would entail serious cuts in
overtime pay.
   The report also recommended a huge reorganization of the
Netherlands' police force involving the transfer of about 2,600
officers from rural forces to the big cities.
   ``We're fearing that such a reorganization will also lead to
force reductions,'' Wolven said.
   The report's recommendations have not yet been adopted by Premier
Ruud Lubber's center-right government, which came to power in 1986
on a strong anti-crime platform promising to increase the size of
the police force.

Says</HEAD>

   An age-old economic principle _ encouraging price
competition _ can help reduce escalating hospital costs, according
to a study.
   The study provides the first evidence that new laws intended to
increase competition among hospitals can help moderate or reverse
the rise in costs, said health economist Glenn A. Melnick of the
University of California-Los Angeles School of Public Health.
   But Melnick cautioned that more research is needed to determine
what impact these policies may have on the quality of care, research
and education and medical services to the poor.
   ``The question arises, were costs lowered by becoming more
efficient or did patient-care quality ... suffer,'' said Melnick,
who co-authored the study published in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   A spokesman for the Westchester, Ill.-based Healthcare Financial
Management Association, an organization representing 26,000
financial managers of hospitals and other health care facilities,
said increased price competition was a mixed blessing.
   ``The competition is having some positive effect in dampening
unnecessary expenditures for new services that might be duplicated
at a nearby hospital,'' said association spokesman Charles Mowll.
   ``But there is a downside to that in that patient convenience and
access to care is being diminished, and as a practical matter,
you're going to see longer waiting lines in hospital outpatient
departments,'' he said.
   ``There has been no significant indication that quality has been
impacted yet, but we certainly have fears that you can only tighten
the screws so much until quality will suffer.''
   The study examined the impact on all 450 California hospitals of
a 1982 state law that allowed the state Medicaid program and private
insurers to negotiate favorable terms from certain hospitals without
fear of antitrust action.
   The ``selective contracting'' law was the first in the country
intended to encourage health-care price competition.
   Melnick and co-author Jack Zwanziger of the Rand Corp. said that
previous studies of hospital competition indicated that competition
based on the quality of doctors, equipment or other amenities led
only to higher costs. The California law was unique in that it was
intended to foster cost-reducing competition.
   Since its passage, similar legislation has been enacted in more
than half the states, spurring a boom in health-care maintenance and
preferred provider organization insurance plans, Melnick said.
   The study found that costs among all California hospitals,
adjusted for inflation, rose an average 4.8 percent a year between
1980-82, but decreased 0.4 percent annually from 1983-85 after the
new law took effect.
   In the most competitive urban centers, total inflation-adjusted
inpatient costs actually decreased a total of 11.3 percent in
1983-85. Inpatient costs for hospitals in low-competition markets,
or markets with very few hospitals, increased by less than 1 percent
during the same period.
   ``Hospitals and physicians located in areas with many competitors
or substantial excess capacity are more likely to agree to accept
lower fees ... in return for the promise of a continued flow of
patients,'' the study said.
   ``Given current national trends ... the behavior now observed in
California is likely to spread to the rest of the country.''
   Melnick said hospital management had been able to adapt ``very
rapidly and in dramatic ways to cut cost ... in what has
traditionally been an industry not considered to be very
entrepreneurial.''
   The study found that patients were spending less time on average
in hospitals and that there was a ``significant shift from inpatient
to outpatient services,'' with hospitals competing directly with
doctors for ambulatory care.

   Soda machines that tip over when rocked by people
wanting their money back or a free drink can maim or kill and should
be fixed so they won't fall, an Army doctor said Thursday.
   In a study published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association, Michael Cosio of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington documented 11 deaths from falling soda machines.
   One victim was found pinned to a wall with the soda machine
resting on his neck. Death was presumed to be due to suffocation.
Others were crushed to death or asphyxiated.
   ``If you look at it from the victims' standpoint ... if they get
hurt if a machine lands on them, they have a 20 (perent) to 25
percent chance that they get killed,'' Cosio said in a telephone
interview.
   Changes are needed to safeguard the public, he said, and a
spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission said the agency
is investigating the problem.
   ``Few people would believe that a soda vending machine can be
tipped over or that anyone would be foolish enough to even try to
tip such a machine,'' Cosio wrote in the study. ``Not only can these
machines be tipped over, but they can injure and even kill.''
   Cosio looked at accidents involving 15 males at military
installations overseas from July 1985 to September 1987. Three were
killed, and 12 victims required hospitalization.
   A follow-up of 32 more males, some civilians, documented eight
more deaths, he said.
   The victims all were shaking or rocking the machines, he said,
some to shake loose a soda without paying, others ``because they're
angry at the machine'' for keeping their money and not dispensing a
soda.
   ``I usually just bang on the front or jiggle the coin return and
if it doesn't work, I just walk away,'' Cosio said.
   The machines generally weigh 800 pounds to 1,000 pounds, but when
not anchored, they can be tipped over without much force, he said.
   ``We've even had a 10-year-old child who got killed.''
   Survivors ``made the same or similar statement about the descent
of the machine,'' he wrote. ``In essence, each victim said, `It came
down faster than I thought. I pushed up, but it was too heavy and it
kept coming. I tried to get out of the way but it caught me.'''
   Ken Giles, a spokesman for the federal consumer safety agency,
said it is investigating, ``and yes, of course, we consider it a
problem. We haven't decided what to do about it.''
   ``It appears that these deaths and injuries are related to one
brand,'' Giles said, but he declined to identify which one because
of the continuing investigation.
   ``If we can pin it down as a brand-name specific problem, then we
can ... work for repair or replacement or some other remedial
measure,'' he said.
   Cosio said machines that dispense free sodas when rocked should
be removed from the market, and others should be secured to the
floor or wall to help avert tipovers.

   American voters showed again this week a
ticket-splitting bent that some pundits say has created a new,
extra-constitutional check on the balance of power in the nation's
capital.
   Republican President-elect George Bush will have a solidly
Democratic House and Senate to contend with, and the Democrats also
padded their lead Tuesday in both governorships and state
legislatures.
   Whatever happened to the ``yellow-dog Democrats'' _ the ones who
supposedly would vote for a yellow dog if it ran as a Democrat _ or
to any yellow-dog Republicans, for that matter? Why is the
electorate so fickle when it comes to following the party line?
   ``This was a unique situation where the candidate of a winning
party for president saw his side lose in senators, House and
governors,'' said GOP analyst Kevin Phillips, publisher of the
American Political Report.
   Phillips, citing Wall Street Journal@NBC News exit polling, saw
a sort of ``negative coattails'' effect with some voters, ``the
sense that you had to set one bunch to watch the others.''
   Michael Dukakis, who had an awful time trying to dodge Bush's
charge that he was a freebooting, big-spending liberal, lost the key
industrial state of Ohio by 10 points and nearly a half-million
votes.
   But Bush wasn't the biggest vote-getter in the Buckeye state.
That honor went to incumbent Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, who
piled up a 57-43 margin in trouncing challenger George Voinovich,
the Republican mayor of Cleveland.
   Metzenbaum is one of the most outspoken liberals in the Senate
and is arguably to the left of Dukakis, as Voinovich constantly
tried to remind Ohio voters.
   William Schneider, the American Enterprise Institute political
analyst, said Metzenbaum ``had the image of a populist, a fighter, a
tough aggressive campaigner who delivered for the people of Ohio.''
   ``But Metzenbaum would not have carried Ohio as a presidential
candidate,'' Schneider said.
   ``The higher the office, the more ideology matters, and the more
ideology matters, the worse Democrats do,'' he said. The public
feels safe in voting Democratic for lower offices ``because frankly
ideology, values, philosophy seldom get engaged in local and state
races.''
   Robert Strauss, the former Democratic party chief now co-chairing
the National Economic Commisssion, said, ``The closer to home you
get, the more the people vote Democratic. We do well in cities as
well as in counties and state legislatures. The Democratic Party is
still the oldest, largest political party in the world, and it's
stil closer to the people than any political party in the world.''
   Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, said, ``People intuitively, if they are not in favor of
divided government, they obviously have nothing against it.''
   ``You can make a pretty good founding fathers-case that that kind
of government makes a certain degree of sense,'' he said.
   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, rejects the
idea that the people are imposing ``a new type of
extra-constitutional check and balance'' on the politicians in
Washington.
   ``I think what's happend is that we have very weak parties and
the American people don't care. They're indifferent to this,'' Hess
said. ``People now, without the moorings of party, are extremely
interested in personality, character and results.''
   He added, ``It doesn't offend them or even perhaps much interest
them whether they vote for a Democrat for governor and then turn
around and vote for a Republican for senator, and then a Democrat
for House of Representatives, and so forth in some political
pingpong.''

<HEAD>State Dept. Says It Would `Severely Scrutinize' Arafat Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A request by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, for a visa to address the United
Nations would be subjected to severe scrutiny, the State Department
said Thursday.
   ``Our view of the PLO hasn't changed,'' spokesman Charles E.
Redman said.
   Arab diplomats in New York spread word this week that Arafat
would like to participate when the General Assembly considers the
Middle East situation later this year.
   Redman said the United Nations had asked the State Department
``to facilitate the issuance of a visa.''
   Arafat spoke to the assembly in 1974, appealing to its members to
``aid our people in its struggle to attain its right to
self-determination.''
   Concluding his address, the PLO chief said he had come ``bearing
an olive branch and a freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive
branch fall from my hand.''
   The PLO is sworn by its covenant to the destruction of Israel. It
has been implicated by the State Department in incidents of
terrorism against Americans and Israelis.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has told Congress that he had
``no desire whatever to see Arafat in the United States.'' He made
the comment in a letter responding to a request from 51 senators to
deny Arafat a visa.
   Redman said ``we will severely scrutinize any application for a
visa in light of applicable laws and regulations and other pertinent
circumstances.'' He declined to elaborate.
   Under the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of 1947, the
United States is not supposed to ``impose any impediment to
transit'' of people involved in the United Nations on official
business.
   On the other hand, Congress has authorized the denial of visas to
supporters of terrorism.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
strictures on obtaining a visa for UN business were less severe than
``if he wanted to come down to Washington or to go someplace else.''
   The State Department's Office to Counter Terrorism has linked the
PLO's executive committee to known terrorists.
   The Israeli government and Jewish groups have protested a visit
by the PLO leader, who has never renounced the provision in his
organization's covenant calling for the dismantling of the Jewish
state.
   ``We do not deem Arafat welcome in any international forum,''
said Barukh Binah, spokesman for the Israeli U.N. mission. ``But the
U.N. commited the original sin _ the acceptance of the PLO, which is
a terrorist organization in the first place.
   ``The PLO has never changed its covenent which still calls for
the destruction of Israel,'' he said, ``and has never renounced
terrorism or accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338,'' which
recognize Israel's right to exist within secure borders.

   Two burned, empty lifeboats were found Thursday on
an oily patch of the north Atlantic, but there were no signs of the
27 crewmen from a tanker that broke in two in stormy seas and burst
into flames, searchers said.
   A Canadian military plane flew over the wreckage of the Odyssey
and found its bow ``barely afloat,'' said Paul Kendrick of the
Canadian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova
Scotia.
   The stern section of the 65,746-ton tanker sank after the vessel
cracked in half. Oil spilled into the ocean and caught fire, coating
the surface with flames that burned hours later.
   Kendrick said none of the Greek and Honduras crewmen was seen on
the bow or in the two badly burned lifeboats floating in the area.
He said the tanker was also believed to carry two life rafts.
   ``If we can't find them, there's not much hope,'' Kendrick said.
Photographs taken of the scene will be analyzed to see if there are
any signs of the crewmen, he said.
   The Odyssey, a Liberian-registered vessel, sent out a distress
signal at 3:22 a.m. about 1,000 miles east of Newfoundland, saying
it needed immediate assistance, coast guard officials said.
   The Soviet weather Passat was the first vessel to reach the
Odyssey. It was 26 miles away when the distress signal was sent out
and rushed to help, but flaming oil kept the Passat from getting
closer than a mile to the stricken vessel, said British and Canadian
coast guard officials.
   Polembros Shipping Ltd. of London, operators of the Odyssey, said
the tanker had a Greek captain, 14 Greek officers and 12 Honduran
sailors.
   ``I am afraid that we have heard nothing at all of survivors,''
said a company spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity.
``There is still a search going on for them.''
   ``It doesn't sound very good at all,'' said a British coast guard
spokesman in Falmouth, who by custom was not identified. ``The
Soviet vessel has lost radio contact with the tanker.''
   In addition to the Passat, another vessel, the bulk carrier
Maritime Wisdom, responded to the distress call and was searching
for survivors. Kendrick said the air search would last into the
night.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said Canadian officials
reported an oil slick 10 miles long and three miles wide in the area.
   Lloyd's said the Odyssey left Sullom Voe, a Scottish oil
terminal, on Nov. 5 and was heading for the Canadian port of Come By
Chance when it broke apart.
   The Canadian coast guard reported stormy weather with winds of 43
mph and high seas and swells. Lloyd's said the Canadian aircraft
reported visibility was reasonable for searching aircraft, but not
for surface vessels.
   The Odyssey was built in 1971 and owned by Diamond Port Shipping
Corp. of Monrovia, Liberia.
   Its distress signal was picked up by Valentia Radio in southern
Ireland and relayed to British coast guard officials in Falmouth who
alerted the Passat, said a coast guard spokesman, who by custom was
not identified.
   The tanker is in the Atlantic sector of responsibility covered by
the Canadians, and the emergency operation was being coordinated in
Halifax with assistance from British coast guard officials.

<TEXT>
   The super collider Texas will name for President Reagan was an
economic dream for the six other finalists for the $4.4 billion atom
smasher, and some losers complained Thursday that politics played a
part in the site selected.
   Gov. Rose Mofford of Arizona, one of the losing states, noted
that the annoucement was made ``only 48 hours after the election''
of Texan George Bush for president.
   The governor of another losing state wasn't necessarily blaming
politics, but money. ``Colorado will compete on its merits,'' said
Roy Romer. ``It is not going to buy it. This state doesn't have to
pay for people to come here.''
   He said Colorado offered no financial incentives for the project.
Texas voters approved a $1.1 billion bond package that would reduce
the federal cost of building the atom smasher in Waxahachie, south
of Dallas.
   The other losers were Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and
Tennessee. The seven were chosen from a field of 25 bidding states
by an independent panel appointed by the Department of Energy.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington said in making the announcement
in Washington that the Texas site was ``superior'' to the others.
   Colorado state Sen. Jim Brandon, a Republican, said the DOE's
decision was political, engineered in Washington through influence
of Texans Jim Wright, U.S. House Speaker, and Lloyd Bentsen,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   Politics suited a jubilant Texas Gov. Bill Clements just fine:
``The icing on the cake is the very special relationship between
Ronald Reagan and Texas.''
   ``The Texas decision has a strong smell of White House
politics,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``That was our major
concern all along. The Michigan application was clearly better than
the Texas proposal. We and the other five finalist states got a raw
deal.''
   In Waxahachie, where the 53-mile doughnut-shaped hole in the
ground will go, most were celebrating the project that would bring
4,000 construction jobs in four to five years, plus 3,500 permanent
jobs to the community of 18,000.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter said he thought the project may have
trouble getting funding.
   ``If I were a member of the United States Congress, the United
States Senate, or had anything to do with the presidency, the No. 1
thing I would do next January is start in the direction of balancing
the budget, regardless of what had to be done,'' he said.
   Congress has appropriated $205 million for the collider,
including $100 million for research and development in fiscal 1989,
but has not authorized its construction.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he doubted presidential politics
played a role since Congress still has to provide the money.
   But he also said, ``If there's a taint of politicalization, then
this project will never become a reality.''
   ``This is a very political animal,'' said David Brooks, chairman
of the Granville County commissioners in North Carolina, one of the
proposed sites. ``I think politics played into it and they have more
political clout down there.''
   But the head of the physics department at Fermilab in Illinois,
Dan Green, looked at it another way. He said the selection of a site
was ``really a good sign that America wants to support high energy
physics and wants to support basic research and wants to recapture a
position they have been frittering away.''

   Singer John Denver, who has said he wants to fly in
a Soviet spacecraft, apparently has balked at the $10 million price
he said the Soviets wanted him to pay.
   Alexander Dunaev, head of the Soviet commercial space agency
Glavkosmos, told a news conference Thursday that a ``U.S. singer''
had failed to meet a Nov. 1 application deadline set by the Soviets.
   ``We haven't gotten a serious request from him,'' Dunaev said,
without identifying the singer by name.
   Denver had said last month that he had until Nov. 1 to accept a
``very serious'' invitation to fly aboard a Soviet spacecraft. But
he said the Soviets' insistence that he pay $10 million would likely
prompt him to drop the project.
   ``I've told them that I'm opposed to paying $10 million, that I
think it's inappropriate, that I think it's negative and that it's
not the way I want to pursue this endeavor,'' Denver had said.
   For that fee, Denver said the Soviets told him he could fly
aboard a Soviet spacecraft and spend time aboard the Mir space
station. ``At this point they have a slot open for me, December of
next year,'' he said.''
   Dunaev did not mention a specific price tag set for Denver, but
indicated it would go up.
   ``If he expresses the desire again, it will be much more
expensive for him,'' he said.
   One Western musical act will be going into space with the Soviets
this month, if only in the form of a recording. Officials told
reporters that a special recording had been made by the British pop
music group Pink Floyd for a joint Soviet-French spaceflight
scheduled for Nov. 26.

   A Veteran's Day memorial service Friday
to honor the late Elmer Smith, this city's last World War I veteran,
will be more lively than thought. In fact, the 88-year-old Smith
says he wouldn't miss it.
   ``Do I look dead?'' asked the smiling former Marine and last
surviving member of North Miami's World War I Barracks No. 879.
   Joe Johnston, city planner and organizer of the planned memorial
to Smith, explained that three people had told him Smith died this
summer. Johnston said the confusion apparently arose from the
disbanding of Barracks No. 879 earlier in the year.
   ``No. 879 was dead,'' Johnston said. ``It got taken the wrong
way'' and the whole thing ``just mushroomed.''
   Smith, who lives at a local Veteran's Administration nursing
home, just chuckled over the incident after getting over an initial
shock.
   North Miami Mayor Howard Neu had the plaque for Smith changed. It
now reads ``In Honor of...'' instead of the originally planned ``In
Memory of...''
   Smith was also asked to make a speech. His response raised
metaphysical questions.
   ``Now, what's a dead man to say?'' he asked.

   Israeli troops in the occupied Gaza Strip
wounded 12 Palestinians on Thursday and blew up the homes of nine
accused of attacking soldiers with grenades or firebombs.
   Islamic fundamentalists urged the Palestine National Council,
which convenes Saturday in Algiers, to wage an armed struggle
against Israel and criticized those who favor peace negotiations.
   A leaflet distributed by a group called Hamas (Zeal) said: ``Who
authorized the PNC to sign a peace agreement with the Jews? Is it
the Palestinian martyrs, is it the wounded, is it the Palestinian
child ... who lost an eye sitting in his mother's lap?
   ``We announce clearly: `No to a Zionist state in the land of
Palestine, no to peace with murderers ... yes to the armed
struggle.'''
   The 450-member PNC, which serves as a Palestinian legislature, is
expected to declare an independent state in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, where 11 Israelis and at least 310 Palestinians have
been killed in an 11-month-old rebellion against Israeli occupation.
   Its declaration is expected to recognize Israel indirectly by
accepting a 1947 U.N. General Assembly resolution that called for
dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.
   Israeli troops are expected to seal off the occupied territories
during the Palestine National Council meeting, barring journalists
without escorts and prohiting Palestinians from traveling to and
from Israel.
   In the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai said the
demolition of nine houses was a lesson to Palestinians that ``those
who try to hurt us with grenades and firebombs will find themselves
hurt.''
   He said the houses belonged to two Palestinians who hurled
grenades at army patrols and members of a gang accused of firebomb
attacks on soldiers. Two soldiers were slightly wounded in a grenade
attack Oct. 12.
   ``We found five more grenades, a pistol, an M-16 rifle, dynamite
sticks, plastic explosives and other weapons,'' Mordechai said on
Israel radio. He is chief of the army's southern command.
   Palestinians told Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group
founded by Arab lawyers, that soldiers bulldozed 72 houses in the
Jifliq shantytown near a settlement where an Israeli soldier was
stabbed to death Monday.
   Army spokesmen said residents who had settled in Jifliq illegally
were being forced to return to their home villages. They would not
reveal the number of houses knocked down.
   In the West Bank, soldiers raided seven Palestinian homes
overnight in the Nablus marked district, Palestinian witnesses
reported. They said it was the third such action in as many days.
   The daily Maariv said the raids were intended to prevent violence
during the PNC meeting and several Palestinians were detained.
   Palestinians confirmed a report in the Jerusalem Post daily that
soldiers smashed windows, vandalized furniture and beat residents,
then ordered them into the streats to remove barricades from roads
and paint over anti-Israeli graffiti. The army said it was checking
the report.
   Violent confrontations were reported in our Gaza Strip refugee
camps. Arab hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded 12
Palestinians, including a 14-year-old girl and two boys aged 13 and
15.
   Military authorities imposed curfews on several refugee camps,
confining 173,000 Palestinians to their homes.
   Members of the Jerusalem-based Arab Journalists Association
demanded the immediate release of 24 Palestinian reporters who have
been in jail for six months without trial under emergency
regulations.
   ``These are repressive measures aimed at depriving the
Palestinian people of knowing what is happening in the occupied
territories,'' Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr,
said at a news conference.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush as president is likely to be more
of a hands-on manager than Ronald Reagan, more interested in foreign
policy, less ideological.
   The man who promises a kinder and gentler nation also says the
stillness of the White House will be broken when he takes over by
the sound of 10 grandchildren laughing and crying.
   The jelly bean jars in the Reagan White House probably will be
replaced with stacks of cracklin' pork rinds, Bush's favorite snack.
   Reagan's favorite magazine was ``Human Events,'' a conservative
political journal. Bush's favorite is ``Bassmaster,'' a fishing
journal.
   Bush, 64, is left-handed. He likes country music, vodka martinis
and Mexican food. He jogs several times a week, covering two miles
in about 18 minutes.
   For fun, he races his Cigarette boat off the chilly waters of
Maine. He's an avid tennis player and fisherman and also likes to
play horseshoes.
   An Episcopalian, he attends church regularly with his wife,
Barbara. They've been married 43 years. They have five children, all
adults now, and dote on their 10 grandchildren.
   In 71 days, Bush will take over from a popular president who
charmed the nation with his easy-going manner, wit and polished
communications skills.
   Bush readily acknowledges he's different.
   ``I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned early that
eloquence won't draw oil from the ground,'' Bush said last summer.
``I may sometimes be a little awkward but there's nothing
self-conscious in my love of country. I am a quiet man but I hear
the quiet people others don't.''
   On another occasion, he said, ``My leadership might not be the
most charismatic but I'm not sure that we need a lot of razzle
dazzle. There's probably enough drama in the world already.''
   Conservatives are worried that Bush, although he took a hard line
during his presidential campaign, will turn into a moderate in the
White House.
   Indeed, his political leanings have drifted over the years. Bush
was a Goldwater Republican in 1966 when he was first elected to
Congress, a Rockefeller Republican in 1980 when he ran for president
and a Reagan Republican ever since.
   ``I suspect that George Bush will want a staff that includes sort
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around
him,'' said Republican consultant David Keene, who once worked for
Bush.
   ``The difference between the styles of (Reagan and Bush) is that
Bush is out of an intellectual and political tradition in which the
emphasis is on finding the right people in public service, seeking
their advice and believing that goals come out of having the right
people in the right places,'' said Keene.
   Bush is considered more pragmatic and issue-oriented than Reagan.
As a onetime envoy to China and the United Nations, as well as chief
of the CIA, Bush has a solid foundation in foreign policy.
   Reagan in his first year in office practically ignored foreign
policy, devoting his attention to budget and tax cuts. Bush says he
wants a NATO summit conference and an early meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution, said that Reagan ``is the most hands-off
manager of the modern presidency. I suspect that George Bush will be
not nearly as hands off. ...''
   Echoing that theme, Lyn Nofziger, who was Reagan's first
political director in the White House, said Bush would be ``probably
more involved in the presidency and the day-to-day operations (but)
probably not a hell of a lot more. He's not a Jimmy Carter or
Michael Dukakis.'' Both Carter and Dukakis are known for their
attention to detail.
   Hess said Bush ``certainly seems to share Reagan's disdain for
the press. He, too, doesn't see being too close to the press as
being in his interest.''
   Though Bush has promised to stay the course set by Reagan, Hess
said ``each president wants to do things differently than the person
he succeeds.''
   ``What kind of president he'll be will depend largely on things
that happen the next four years that are largely out of his control
_ whether the Iranians take over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran or
something like that,'' Hess said. ``There are going to be some
things that happen in the next four years in which the mettle of the
man will have to be assessed.''
   On that very point, Bush told an audience recently that the Oval
Office was a place for ``the moments that cut through the expected
and the everyday and force us, through action, to define ourselves.
   ``I don't know what the cutting moments will be for the next
president,'' Bush said. ``But I know they'll come. And I know I'm
ready.''

<HEAD>Researchers Show AIDS Can Infect Immature Blood Cells in Bone
Marrow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS can invade immature blood cells in the
bone marrow and turn them into ``bags of virus'' that may be major
reservoirs for the fatal immune deficiency disease, researchers
reported in a new study.
   Thomas M. Folks, head of a virology laboratory at the federal
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said Thursday that the
finding confirms that the AIDS virus is able to infect and reproduce
within stem cells _ immature cells that grow in the bone marrow and
develop into components of the blood.
   ``This is probably a cell that helps set up the reservoir of
infection and allows the disease to become chronic and linger for a
long period of time,'' Folks said in a telephone interview.
   Folks said he and a team of researchers used a new technique to
purify stem cells from bone marrow extracted from a cadaver.
   The stem cells then were exposed to human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, that causes AIDS, and then cultured in test tubes.
   ``After 40 or 50 days, the cells in the culture became packed
with HIV virus,'' Folks said. ``The cells became bags of virus.''
   The infected cells developed into macrophages, a type of cell
that fights disease by engulfing and digesting bacteria or other
infective agents.
   Folks said for people infected with AIDS, macrophages may develop
into ``bags of virus'' that actually can spread the infection to
other parts of the body.
   ``It may be that these stem cells get infected with AIDs and then
they move to the brain, or the lungs or whereever macrophages might
roam,'' Folks said.
   He said this is speculation, since his study was done only in
test tubes, but he said the study did show that macrophages can
become so engorged with viruses that the cell finally bursts and the
viral products re released.
   Folks said the virus develops differently in the stem cell than
it does in the T-cell, another type of blood cell attacked by HIV.
In the T-cell, the virus creates buds on the cell surface. These
buds can become a target of antibodies. But in the stem cell, the
virus reproduces within the cell wall and there is no clue on the
outside that would attract attack by antibodies.
   For this reason, he said, the bone marrow cells may form a
reservoir of disease that would be difficult to attack with a
vaccine.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease
that can spread by an exchange of body fluids, such as in sexual
contact, transfusion by infected blood products, sharing of infected
needles or from birthing mother to child. The disease kills by
disabling the body's immune system and making it unable to resist
other infections.
   As of Oct. 17, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,768 Americans,
of whom 42,653 have died since June 1, 1981, according to the CDC.
No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   The study co-authored by Folks will be published Friday in
Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science.
   Other co-authors of the study are Jan M. Orenstein, Elaine Jaffe,
Jesse S. Justement and Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institutes
of Health, and Steven W. Kessler of the the Naval Medical Research
Institute.

   Firefighters on Thursday finally
extinguished a blaze that killed 22 people at an oil refinery and
burned for more than a day, officials said.
   Thirty-one people were hospitalized with injuries suffered in the
fire that broke out at midday Wednesday and was put out 27 hours
later. Twelve of them were listed in critical condition.
   R.K. Gajree, chairman of the government-owned Bharat Petroleum
Corp. Ltd., said 17 bodies had been identified but five others were
too badly burned.
   ``People were seen running naked when the fire began. Everyone in
the way was burned,'' he said.
   Gajree said the cause of the fire had not been determined. ``It
could be a cigarette or anything else,'' he said. ``Three loud
explosions were heard, but they could have been caused by flammable
vapor.''
   The fire started at a naphtha tank and spread to two other tanks.
   K.R.S. Narayan, director of the company's refinery division, said
the explosion may have occurred in a dispatch unit where trucks are
loaded near the naphtha tanks.
   But two truck drivers who saw the naphtha tanks explode said they
thought the explosion originated closer to the tanks.
   Within seconds, the roof of the first tank blew off, said one of
the truckers, Abdul Majid.
   Majid, 28, was hospitalized with burns over 10 percent of his
body.

   A man who was on a hijacked TWA
jetliner said Thursday the seizure of the plane appeared to have
been well-planned but that once the hijackers had the jet, they were
thrown into confusion.
   Thomas Murry, an employee of a U.S. aviation company, was the
second American witnesses to testify Thursday at the trial of
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who admitted taken part in the June 1985
hijacking.
   ``The whole thing (hijacking) was like a theatrical performance,
a well-rehearsed play, in which something had gone wrong, they could
not follow the preferred script,'' Murry said.
   Murry, 61, said watching the hijackers ``running up and down the
aisle'' of the airplane ``was as if they weren't prepared for an
aircraft with a door at the back.''
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the hijacking of TWA Flight 847. U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem was killed, and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days
during the ordeal.
   Hamadi has has denied killing the 23-year-old sailor.
   Earlier Thursday, another former hostage said he feared that
someone on the airplane might attempt to overpower the terrorists
and cause them to set off a hand grenade they were carrying.
   ``I had a fear that someone would try to attack the hijackers and
they would drop the grenade,'' said Robert Trautmann, a 40-year-old
real estate developer.
   Trautmann also spoke of the brutal beatings of passengers during
the hijacking, as have many witnesses since the trial began July 5.
   ``I heard the beatings and screams in the front of the plane,''
he told the court, saying that at one point ``I feared I would be
killed.''
   Neither Murry or Trautmann said where he was from, under
guidelines set by the court to protect witnesses' security. At the
time of the hijacking Trautmann lived in Laredo, Texas, and Murry in
Valencia, Calif.
   Hamadi often looked back to the spectator section where his
parents, Ali Hassan and Fatima Hamadi, were sitting.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, also attended
the session, as they have done regularly since the trial opened.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   The U.S. Air Force has been flying a
``Stealth'' radar-evading jet fighter for seven years, and now has
about 50 of the planes at an isolated base in Nevada, the Pentagon
acknowledged Thursday.
   Partially lifting a veil of secrecy that has enveloped the plane
from its birth, the Pentagon and Air Force released a photograph of
the unusual aircraft but declined to discuss its capabilities. The
limited disclosures were made now because the Air Force needs to
start flying the craft in daylight, a spokesman said.
   The Pentagon said the plane had been declared operational and
ready for wartime missions in October 1983, but that it first flew
in June 1981.
   The Stealth fighter ``is officially known as the F-117A,'' said
Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   ``It has been operational since October 1983 and is assigned to
the 4450th Tactical Group at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. The
aircraft is based at the Tonopah Test Range Airfield in Nevada.''
   The photograph released by the Pentagon depicts a relatively
small, swept-wing plane with a flat underbelly. It somewhat
resembles a sting ray _ black or dark blue with no exterior markings.
   The cockpit is located far forward in a nose that comes to a
sharp point, with what appears to be gun barrels or air-speed probes
sticking out.
   The plane features a ``V'' tail atop a fuselage that ends in a
rectangle, apparently completely encompassing the two engines that
power the plane. The air intakes for the engines appear to be fitted
tightly into the sides of the fuselage, just below the cockpit.
   The swept-back wings would suggest the plane is capable of flying
at supersonic speeds, but the Air Force declined to discuss the
matter. Military sources have said the plane is designed for sneak
ground attacks and not air-to-air dogfighting.
   The Air Force has ordered 59 of the planes and 52 of them have
been delivered, Howard said. Three of the planes have crashed and
two pilots have been killed, the Air Force added.
   To protect its secrecy, the plane has been flown only at night.
But the Air Force needs to start flying the plane during daylight if
it is to integrate the squadron's war plans with other units, Howard
said.
   Howard and Air Force officials declined to discuss how much the
program cost. Neither would they offer information on the plane's
dimensions or general capabilities, the materials from which it was
constructed, or the major subcontractors involved.
   The plane is built by the Lockheed Corp. at a tightly guarded
plant in Burbank, Calif., the Air Force said.
   The very first production model of the plane crashed with a
Lockheed Corp. pilot at the controls, the Air Force said. That test
pilot survived the accident, for which no date was given.
   The second crash occurred on July 11, 1986, near Bakersfield,
Calif., and the third on Oct. 14, 1987, at Nellis Air Force Base,
the service said. Both pilots were killed.
   The Stealth fighter is ``a mature system which has enjoyed
bipartisan congressional support since its inception (and) can now
be fully integrated into operational plans in support of world-wide
defense commitments,'' Howard said.
   The spokesman denied the administration was trying to bolster
support for Republican defense policies by unveiling the plane.
   ``In order to move the system further along, they have to start
daytime flying,'' Howard said. ``That's what driving it. And I think
both sides of the aisle on the Hill understand that ...''
   According to military sources, the planes are kept at a high
state of readiness for use as ``aerial shock troops,'' capable of
slipping behind enemy lines without being detected on radar and
creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs.
   The sources said the decision to unveil the plane was prompted in
part by the scheduled Nov. 22 unveiling of the B-2 Stealth bomber.
The bomber has been built with more recent and advanced technology
than the fighter, so there is little reason to continue to hide the
fighter, the sources explained.
   Pentagon officials also had glumly concluded that even if they
wanted to keep the program secret, upcoming court fights were likely
to shatter security, the sources continued.
   Production line workers at the Lockheed plant in Burbank have
gone to court with charges they are being sickened by exposure to
dangerous chemicals.

   China acknowledged Thursday it has only begun to
count casualties and damage from the earthquake that devastated its
southern border region, and it said the death toll, now at 938, is
expected to rise.
   The official count of those seriously injured rose to more than
2,870, with no count being kept of those with minor injuries. A
leading seismologist estimated more than 1,000 were dead and
predicted another strong quake will soon hit the same area along the
Burmese border.
   An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale shook the
southeastern Chinese provinces of Guangxi Zhuang and Guangdong on
Thursday, but the State Seismology Bureau said it was centered
off-shore in the Beibu Gulf and no damage was reported.
   Seismologists said it may have been an aftershock to the Sunday
quake that devastated dozens of remote towns and farming villages in
Yunnan province, west of Guangxi Zhuang. That quake measured 7.6 on
the Richter scale.
   ``Both the number of injured and the death toll are expected to
rise as rescue workers reach isolated villages and unearth more
bodies,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Xinhua issued half a dozen reports on the quake Thursday,
acknowledging for the first time the scope of the disaster after
days of near silence.
   It said the quake had ``almost totally destroyed'' a
13-square-mile area. A much larger area suffered lesser damage.
   In the worst-hit village, Zhanmapo, Xinhua said doctors had set
up a makeshift open-air hospital because tents had not yet arrived.
All 287 dead in the village were buried, it said.
   ``So far, no infectious diseases have occurred,'' it quoted Zhan
Fubao, head of the local epidemic prevention station, as saying.
   Xinhua said 707 bodies were recovered in the quake zone, still
far below the figure of 938 dead that government officials told U.N.
Aid agencies. The officials also said more than 100,000 people were
homeless.
   Chen Yong, deputy director of the State Seismology Bureau, told
Xinhua he estimated more than 1,000 were dead.
   ``Most of the buildings in the area were built of bamboo and
wood, and over 80 percent of them have collapsed,'' he said.
   Chen said about 190 aftershocks have hit the same area and
predicted that one measuring about 6.0 on the Richter scale will hit
soon.
   ``Strong aftershocks will probably last about two months or even
longer,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the strength of an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of
6.0 is capable of causing considerable damage. Each increase of one
digit on the scale indicates a tenfold increase in strength.
   Song Jian, a member of the ruling Communist Party's policymaking
Central Committee and of the State Council, China's cabinet, arrived
at the quake epicenter Thursday afternoon to inspect damage.
   Xinhua said he praised rescue workers for their round-the-clock
efforts and promised the party will help quake victims rebuild their
homes.
   Two thousand soldiers ``have been working without sleep or rest,
digging victims from the wreckage of collapsed buildings, giving
emergency first-aid to the injured, repairing highways, building
temporary shelters and delivering food to the survivors,'' Xinhua
said.
   More than 75 tons of medicine and 24 tons of food have been sent
into the quake area by helicopter, truck and horse-drawn cart, the
news agency said. Fuel and building materials also have been brought
in.
   The government told the United Nations Development Program and
World Food Program on Wednesday that it would welcome outside aid.

   An elementary school principal arrested for
allegedly buying two vials of crack was vilified Thursday by parents
demanding his removal and defended by shocked co-workers as he
awaited arraignment on drug charges.
   Matthew Barnwell, 55, the first city principal ever arrested on
drug charges, remained on the Board of Education payroll following
his arrest Wednesday, one week after Schools Chancellor Richard
Green announced a drug crackdown in schools.
   ``This is a terribly shocking incident. It's distressing,'' said
Ted Ellsworth, head of the 4,600-member Council of Supervisors and
Administrators. Ellsworth said the arrest for criminal possession of
a controlled substance was the first drug arrest among his
membership.
   The bust on a Harlem streetcorner near Barnwell's home sparked
angry comments from parents with children attending P.S. 53 in the
Morrisania section of the Bronx, while co-workers came to Barnwell's
defense.
   Parents and school officials charged Barnwell was frequently late
or absent from school. He had been suspended for 10 days in 1975.
   ``I don't like everyone talking against my principal,'' said
Elizabeth Galloway, a school aide at the elementary school, which
has 1,300 pupils. ``If something is wrong, he should be given an
opportunity to get himself well.''
   Agreed school administrator Robert Hannibal: ``This is getting
blown out of proportion.''
   But Elizabeth Mack, who has two girls in the fourth grade at the
school, demanded Barnwell's removal.
   ``He should have never had the job in the first place,'' said Ms.
Mack, standing outside the school with her daughters. ``He was
endangering our kids' lives. I'm glad he's not here now.''
   Desiree DeLoach refused to let her 5-year-old daughter Shamieka
inside the school building Thursday. ``I was very angry. I came here
this morning and made a lot of noise,'' she said.
   Ellsworth, however, called Barnwell's arrest an isolated incident
which shouldn't reflect poorly on the rest of the city's school
employees.
   ``While this is terribly disturbing, we have thousands of workers
fighting to keep drugs out of the schools and get rid of the
problem,'' said Ellsworth. ``It is not my sense that drug-testing is
needed.''
   Barnwell's record as principal of the school was troubled during
his 16-year tenure, school officials said. In 1975, he was suspended
for 10 days after covering up for an assistant principal accused of
using corporal punishment.
   Jerome Greene, a member of the local school board, said Barnwell
had been taken off the job and temporarily reassigned three other
times recently for his ``regular lateness, his absence and his
general demeanor.''
   Once Barnwell is arraigned and released, he will be reassigned to
the local district office with pay pending completion of legal
action, said Board of Education spokesman Frank Sobrino.

   About 20,000 protesters rallied in the
streets of the capital Thursday and demanded that President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad resign to pave the way for parliamentary elections.
   The demonstrators, shouting anti-government slogans, met in five
separate rallies to mark the anniversary of a violent campaign
launched on Nov. 10, 1987, to topple Ershad.
   But political observers say they believe lack of unity among the
opposition groups make the removal of the president improbable.
   Among the organizers of Thursday's rallies were Sheik Hasina,
leader of the Awami League, Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, other leftist parties and the Moslem
fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami.
   Ershad, 59, seized power in a March 1982 coup and imposed
military law, which was lifted in November 1986 in favor of a
civilian government.
   His Jatiya Party won a parliamentary majority in disputed March 3
elections that were boycotted by the 20 major opposition parties _
including those led by Mrs. Zia and Sheik Hasina _ that have no vote
in Parliament.
   Parliament earlier this year passed a law making Islam the
official religion of this 85 percent Moslem nation, drawing strong
protests from opposition politicians, women, students and
representative of Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities.
   Mrs. Zia told a noontime rally of about 5,000 cheering supporters
in the city's main square that the 300-seat Parliament must be
dissolved in favor of a caretaker government that would organize new
elections.
   Sheik Hasina, daughter of slain President Sheik Mujibur Rahman,
who led Bangladesh after it won independence from Pakistan in 1971,
told a rally of about 10,000 supporters: ``We want true democracy
and a genuine representative government ... Our campaign against the
autocratic rule of Ershad is continuing.''
   Last year, supporters of Mrs. Zia and Hasina joined forces to
stage violent street protests and general strikes, but the two
groups have since drifted apart.
   ``We do not want any unity with those who have secret deals with
the (military) and the government,'' Hasina said, referring to Mrs.
Zia, whom she has accused of having links with the army.
   Mrs. Zia's husband, Ziaur Rahman, came to power in a
military-civilian uprising that toppled the government of Mujibur
Rahman, Sheik Hasina's father, on Nov. 7, 1975. Ziaur Rahman was
killed in an aborted military coup in May 1981.
   ``(The opposition) is observing the anniversary of their
failure,'' Shah Moazzem Hossain, secretary general of governing
Jatiya Party, told a rally near Dhaka on Wednesday.
   Ershad is to travel to the United States for a special session of
the U.N. General Assembly on Nov. 16 in which he is expected to
speak about the flooding in Bangaldesh that killed more than 1,500
people and left 40 million homeless.

   The American Society of Newspaper Editors has
written a letter of protest to British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher over her government's ban on broadcast interviews with
members of certain militant groups in Northern Ireland.
   ASNE expressed ``profound dismay'' over the restrictions imposed
Oct. 20 on the two British radio and TV networks, saying the ban is
``unworthy of a great nation's long traditions of democracy and free
speech.''
   ``Repression in Great Britain sets an unfortunate precedent for
government leaders in other regions of the world, nations where the
American and British press organizations are working to help the
local press establish basic free speech rights,'' said the letter
signed by John Seigenthaler, editor and publisher of the Nashville
Tennessean and president of ASNE.
   ``Your government's recent actions will be harmful to world press
freedom for many years,'' said the letter, sent Wednesday.
   The British ban prohibits broadcast interviews with members of
the outlawed Irish Republican Army and 10 other militant groups in
Northern Ireland and their sympathizers. Radio and television still
can report the views of members of these organizations.
   The ban was imposed after an upsurge in killings by the mainly
Roman Catholic IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.

   President-elect George Bush sent a message
Thursday to military forces overseas by way of a national program
designed to lift the spirits of servicemen and woman abroad through
letters ``From America With Love.''
   In his letter, which was telecopied to the U.S. forces in Seoul,
Korea, during a news conference on program, Vice President Bush
said, ``Your talent, courage and dedication is largely responsible
for our America's peace and security.
   ``Furthermore, your work has benefited millions around the world
who thirst for freedom and strive for peace,'' he said. ``You have a
great deal of which to be proud because you carry an awesome burden.
As a result, you have our deepest gratitude and pride.''
   Tony Amason, executive vice president and general manager of the
Atlanta-based Lanier Voice Products company which is sponsoring the
program, said the vice president's message would be telecopied to
Army bases in 21 foreign countries as well as to four ships which
will be on active duty during the holidays.
   Participants in seven U.S. cities - Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago,
Hartford, Los Angeles, Seattle and Phoenix - will be able to send
letters via a facsimile communications network. All other letters
will be sent directly to the nation's capital, where they will be
packaged and shipped overseas.
   The goal of the company is to reach 500,000 men and women who are
stationed outside the continental United States. Amason said there
have been 255,000 letters received thus far.
   The company has budgeted $250,000 for the program.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, leader of the
People's Democratic Party, on Thursday promised to end the
``reactionary'' legacy of the late President Zia ul-Haq if she is
elected Nov. 16.
   ``Zia's 11-year rule was replete with floggings, hangings and
suppression of democratic people and institutions,'' Ms. Bhutto told
tens of thousands of cheering supporters, who punctuated her speech
in this northeastern city with chants of ``Benazir will rule!'' and
``Benazir, the rising sun!''
   The elections for the 217-seat national assembly ``will usher in
an era of freedom and prosperity for the people of Pakistan,'' Ms.
Bhutto told the crowd. ``That will be the end of the Zia legacy.''
   Zia died in an Aug. 17 plane crash that killed 29 other people,
including five top army generals and the U.S. ambassador to
Pakistan, Arnold Raphel.
   The 35-year-old daughter of the late prime minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, who was ousted by Zia in a 1977 coup and ordered hanged,
said the late president's term in office ``was like a dark shadow
that has started to lift.'' The national assembly elections, whose
winner will become the new prime minister, will be followed on Nov.
19 by voting for the provincial legislative assemblies.
   Ms. Bhutto's supporters appear to be so sure of her victory that
some of them address her as ``prime minister.''
   Her Pakistan People's Party is pitted against the nine-party
Islamic Democratic Alliance, which includes the Pakistan Muslim
League headed by former prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo.
   Thursday's rally was dominated by the memory of the two dead
leaders, Zia and Bhutto.
   Ms. Bhutto has accused the Islamic Democratic Alliance and Zia
loyalists of having a poor human rights record. Members of the
alliance say that Ali Bhutto committed political murders, jailed his
opponents, had them kidnapped and denied a wide range of freedoms
during his seven years in office.
   ``My father gave this nation prosperity, and an honorable place
to Pakistan in its global ties,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who described
Zia's government and policies as ``reactionary.''
   Just before the rally, several hundred supporters of both parties
clashed near a mosque in Rawalpindi, chanting slogans against each
other and throwing rocks. Dozens of armed police officers separated
the two groups. No one was injured and there were no arrests.
   Junejo, who also was campaigning Thursday, spoke at a rally of
his supporters in Wazirabad, 110 miles southeast of Rawalpindi. He
asked them ``to ensure security for Pakistan's Islamic ideology and
its geographical frontiers.''
   Nawaz Sharif, another leader of the Islamic Democratic Alliance
whose power base is in the province of Punjab, addressed a separate
rally in Fatehjang, 30 miles west of Rawalpindi.
   He said the Islamic Democratic Alliance, if elected, would
``establish an exploitation-free and Islamic welfare society to
provide inexpensive justice and a respectable living standard to the
common people.''

<DATELINE>EXETER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged with sexually assaulting his
young daughter was acquitted Thursday, nearly 1{ years after his
estranged wife chose jail rather than let him see the child.
   After the Rockingham County Superior Court jury issued its
verdict, Mark Russell Murabito, 33, of Derry said he will seek
custody of the girl, now 5{, and her 4-year-old brother.
   ``She's just a little girl, and like other people who got
involved with my wife, she got used,'' Murabito said.
   The jury began deliberating late Wednesday, resumed Thursday
morning and returned the verdict just before noon.
   County Attorney Carleton Eldredge, who brought the charge against
Murabito in March, said he was disappointed with the verdict.
   Murabito's now ex-wife, Jesse Murabito, 40, of Belmont, was led
from the courtroom by supporters with her head down and left through
the back of the courthouse to avoid reporters.
   A spokeswoman from Nashua Rape and Assault Support Services,
which has supported Mrs. Murabito since 1986, said the woman ``is in
a state of shock.''
   ``As far as the criminal justice system goes on this case, it's
over,'' said Deborah Fauth, the agency's program director. ``We
tried to make the system work. We have a strong belief in the
system. We're just disappointed at the outcome.''
   In February 1987, Mrs. Murabito went to jail after disobeying a
court order to disclose the children's whereabouts. After a week,
she was released when she permitted Murabito supervised visitation
rights.
   In a divorce hearing in March 1987, a judge ruled there was
insufficient evidence to back her claims and gave Murabito
unsupervised visitation.
   A grand jury a year later indicted Murabito on a charge that he
sexually assaulted the child after he was given unsupervised
visitation rights.
   During the trial, defense lawyers contended Mrs. Murabito hoped
to make up to $1.5 million on book and movie rights to her story.
She denied the charge.
   They also said she influenced the daughter, through repeated
interrogations, to describe the alleged abuse.
   The prosecution's first witness was the child. The courtroom was
closed and requests to get a transcript of her testimony were
rejected.
   A doctor testified that during a September 1987 examination of
the girl he found internal scar tissue he judged to be a ``sexual
injury.'' He could not say how or when the injury was inflicted, but
doubted the girl caused the injury herself.

   George Bush's election as president
has left this chic seaside resort pleased and proud, but also
concerned over a tourist invasion if it becomes the site of the next
summer White House.
   ``I think everyone's real excited,'' Kathy Anuszewski said as she
worked at The Lobster Port, a shop Bush frequents about a mile from
his family compound. ``But no one really knows what to expect about
its effect on the town.''
   Bush has spent every summer since he was a child _ except when he
was serving as a pilot during World War II _ in this seaside
community of 4,500. He and his wife Barbara own a nine-bedroom home
on rockbound Walker's Point, a peninsula that juts into the Atlantic.
   Local residents speak of Bush and his family with reverence. Even
those worried about the potential consequences of the Secret
Service, a White House staff, journalists and tourists converging on
the town admit that having the president of the United States living
nearby is an honor.
   ``I am proud. I'm pleased he'll be here,'' said Gerda Towne, who
owns two stores in the upscale town, where shopping and sailing are
prime activities.
   But Towne also expressed concern that Kennebunkport, where
jewelry, brass and maritime-related items sell at a premium, might
soon be invaded by T-shirt and postcard shops. In fact, since Bush
was elected vice president, a few T-shirt shops have already opened.
   ``The merchants have got to be sure the town doesn't go to pot.
We don't want any honky-tonks,'' Towne declared.
   Janet Winters, a member of the town's Board of Selectmen, said
there is also concern about the effect of tourist traffic on the
town. Already the narrow, two-lane streets are clogged daily between
May and September.
   Ocean Avenue, the winding, thin road where the Bush family lives,
is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare by the
hour at the Bush estate. Many locals say they fear those crowds will
grow.
   ``I'm a little leery because I don't know what costs the town
will incur,'' Winters said. ``Every bus tour that comes into
southern Maine will swing into town.
   ``But, still,'' she added, ``there's a sense of pride in him, a
feeling it's our town that could be the center of attention.''
   Earlier this year, Bush said he would forego Kennebunkport as his
vacation retreat if the town and its residents would suffer by his
presence.

   Mayor William H. Hudnut III and Marion County
Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith have expressed interest in the Senate
seat Dan Quayle will vacate next year, a local Republican Party
official said Thursday.
   County Republican Chairman John W. Sweezy said the vacancy came
up during discussions with Hudnut and Goldsmith about the future of
the state party after Quayle becomes vice president.
   Hudnut took along his longtime political aide Bruce B. Melchert
when he met with Sweezy. The mayor declined to comment on the
meeting.
   The discussion ``was about politics. I'm sure it (the Senate
vacancy) came up in discussion,'' said David Arland, Hudnut's media
aide. ``He (the mayor) did not say they talked about it, but you and
I know he probably did.
   ``It's an item for discussion,'' Arland said.
   Goldsmith confirmed he discussed the position with Sweezy.
   ``I just expressed my interest to my county chairman, which is
what I was told is the traditional way to do these things. I'm
obviously interested, but I'm really not an active candidate because
you can't campaign for it,'' Goldsmith said.
   Sweezy said he has not been asked by Gov. Robert D. Orr to
``shake the bushes'' to see who may be interested in the vacancy.
   ``I would imagine that anyone interested would go to the governor
and present his case why he should be chosen,'' he added.
   Orr has said he will wait until Quayle resigns his Senate seat to
select a successor who can ``function effectively.''
   ``It needs to be somebody also, man or woman, who has the
capacity to campaign statewide twice in the period of three years,''
he said. ``That's an unbelievable undertaking, campaigning, let
alone raising the money to be successful.''
   Quayle won re-election in 1986 and his successor would serve
until 1990 when a special election would be held to determine who
would complete the remaining two years of his term.
   Published reports and speculation by political insiders have
named other possible candidates as Rep. Dan Coats; unsuccessful GOP
gubernatorial candidate John Mutz; and state Rep. Paul Mannweiler,
who is speaker of the Indiana House.

   Vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slurs at a Jewish
cemetery in Rhode Island and in the office of a Jewish student
organization in New York one day after a ceremony marking the 50th
anniversary of Kristallnacht.
   ``I can't even find the word for it, it's so hurtful,'' James
Oppenheim, president of the Jewish Student Union at the State
University of New York at Binghamton, N.Y., said Thursday.
   There was no sign of forced entry at the office and sanctuary in
the basement of the student union, Oppenheim said. The group has
about 200 students that coordinate activities on the campus, which
has about 5,000 Jewish students.
   ``I think it's politically motivated because they didn't do any
damage that we can see,'' Oppenheim said.
   Police were taking fingerprints in the rooms but had no suspects,
said Raymond Dye, vice president of student affairs.
   On Wednesday night the Jewish group sponsored a candlelight vigil
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night the
Nazis began their first organized assaults against the Jews in
Germany and Austria.
   In Woonsocket, R.I., vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic
slogans at a 95-year-old Jewish cemetery, but police were uncertain
whether the attack was related to Kristallnacht observances.
   A woman visiting B'nai Israel Cemetery Tuesday found her son's
headstone among the approximately half-dozen covered with swastikas
and other Nazi symbols. The main road to the cemetery also had been
inscribed with anti-Jewish slogans and the German word for Jew,
``Juden.''
   ``Today when I went to the cemetery, it was a very terrible
reminder of things that have happened to us in the past,'' Temple
B'nai Israel President Edith Wittes told those assembled for a
Kristallnacht memorial service.
   In addition to the Nazi symbols, there were other images with
possible links to Satanic worship, such as skulls and an inverted
cross with its arms turned down.
   ``The sickness that made Adolf Hitler possible is alive and well
today, in our own community,'' said Rabbi Joel Chernikoff.

   The State Department accused the Soviet Union

   Spokesman Charles E. Redman said attacks were carried out in
various parts of Afghanistan, sometimes by Backfire bombers launched

   He said the State Department had urged the rebels to show
restraint in their attacks on Soviet troops in the country. But,
Redman said, ``the question of restraint in the conduct of the war
is something that the Mujahedeen have to determine. It is, after

   Former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, a
World War II Navy hero who is chiefly remembered for his role in the
Watergate scandal, will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery
with full military honors.
   The funeral Saturday at Washington's National Cathedral for
Mitchell, a very private man, will be public but the burial will be
in the presence only of relatives and close friends.
   The office of Richard M. Nixon did not know whether the former
president would attend the service. Mitchell was Nixon's friend, law
partner and campaign manager in the successful 1968 and 1972
presidential campaigns.
   The 75-year-old Mitchell died after suffering a heart attack
Wednesday near his home in the Georgetown section of Washington.
   Robert Mardian, an assistant attorney general under Mitchell and
a co-defendant at the Watergate coverup trial, called him ``one of
the most brilliant men I've ever known.''
   ``He had a dry sense of humor, very considerate, a very kind
man,'' Mardian said.
   Mardian was one of five men tried for conspiring to cover up
White House involvement in the burglary of Democratic national
headquarters in the Watergate Office Building. The burglars were
agents of the Committee to Re-Elect the President, which Mitchell
headed.
   One of the five, lawyer Kenneth Parkinson, was acquitted, and
Mardian's conviction was overturned on appeal. Mitchell served 19
months in a federal prison, although five of them were spent outside
on medical furloughs. Former Nixon chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and
domestic counselor John D. Ehrlichman each seved 18 months.
   Ehrlichman, who lives in Santa Fe, N.M., and Haldeman, in Santa
Barbara, Calif., declined Thursday to comment on Mitchell's death.
   But Abbie Hoffman, one of the Chicago Seven defendants prosecuted
by Mitchell's Justice Department in connection with the riots during
the 1968 Democratic National Convention, said: ``Wherever he's
going, I hope he has a good lawyer.''
   Richard Kleindienst, who succeeded Mitchell as attorney general,
characterized him as ``a fine man who got caught up in a bizarre
situation, protected his president and went to jail for it.''
   Henry Kissinger, national security adviser and secretary of state
in the Nixon administration, praised Mitchell for his loyalty to
Nixon. ``The Watergate thing, I just had no first-hand chance to
observe, but I respected Mitchell,'' Kissinger said.
   In World War II, Mitchell was commander of the PT boat squadron
in which John F. Kennedy served as a lieutenant. He was awarded two
Purple Hearts for combat wounds and also won the Silver Star, one of
the Navy's highest decorations.
   Mitchell began his relationship with Nixon when their two law
firms merged in 1967 and, although a year younger, became Nixon's
mentor. They remained friends even though Nixon once suggested, in a
taped White House conversation, that Mitchell take the whole rap for
the Watergate coverup.
   As attorney general, Mitchell loosened wiretap restrictions and
submitted an anti-crime package to Congress that included pretrial
detention of those considered likely to commit further crimes if
freed on bail.
   He was considered the force behind a bill that would have
permitted the 1965 Voting Rights Act to expire.
   Mitchell was born in Detroit on Sept. 15, 1913. He was reared on
Long Island, N.Y, and attended Fordham University in New York
because it had an accelerated law school. He specialized in bond law.
   Mitchell's second wife, the flamboyant Martha, died in 1976 and a
son by his first marriage died a few years ago. Mitchell did not
remarry, but had a longstanding relationship with Washington
socialite Mary Gore Dean. He leaves two daughters and five
grandchildren.

   Conservative Republican Rep. Connie Mack III won a
cliffhanger Senate race Thursday over Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay,
a moderate Democrat, for the seat being relinquished by Democratic
Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   Mack's narrow victory, based on absentee ballots still being
counted, decided the last of this year's 33 Senate races. It means
the Democrats will have a 55-45 majority, a gain of one seat, in the
new U.S. Senate.
   But while Mack claimed victory, MacKay did not immediately
concede and his campaign manager said there might be a legal
challenge because of what he called irregularities in some vote
totals.
   ``I think at this point the numbers are conclusive,'' Mack told
The Associated Press by telephone. ``It's very exciting.
   ``I don't know the exact word to use ... There's been a great
deal of anxiety. It's been long, it's been tough, but I felt all
along that my message of more freedom; free markets, freedom from
taxes, freedom as an objective of our foreign policy, would come
through clearly,'' said Mack, 48-year-old grandson of the Baseball
Hall of Fame manager.
   The AP's latest tally showed Mack with 2,044,575 votes, or 50
percent, to MacKay's 2,014,924 votes, also 50 percent. That gave
Mack a margin of nearly 30,000 votes, more than enough to avoid the
automatic recount that would be triggered if the difference was less
than about 20,000. About 5,000 absentee votes still were out in Bay
County, a Mack stronghold in the Panhandle.
   Campaign Manager Greg Farmer said MacKay, who remained at his
home in Ocala's historic district, planned a conference call with
legal counsel to discuss taking the election to court, as Farmer
recommended.
   ``We may have to ask the fat lady for an encore,'' Farmer said.
``Something's screwy with those numbers.''
   Farmer said that the way races were listed on the ballots may
have confused voters in some counties. He cited three counties where
more votes were cast for president than Senate: Hillsborough County,
where the difference was nearly 60,000; Palm Beach, where it was
nearly 52,000; and Dade, nearly 49,000.
   ``Mike Dukakis got more votes in Palm Beach than Buddy MacKay?
C'mon, now,'' Farmer said by telephone.
   MacKay, 55, was doing some gardening, and also had told his staff
he would be praying and reading poetry until the results were known.
He told staffers he had taken a risk, as is sometimes necessary in
life, and fallen short. While his political career might be ending,
MacKay said, he would remain in public service.
   As 3.9 million votes filtered in election night, exit polls were
enough for the three major television networks to declare MacKay the
winner.
   But Mack moved ahead Wednesday as partial results from 134,000
absentee ballots came in. The absentee ballots have traditionally
favored Republicans in Florida, and the GOP earlier this year had a
special drive to register supporters likely to vote by absentee
ballot.
   Mack, a former bank president, and MacKay, a lawyer who's been
one of Florida's most-praised politicians for two decades, both were
elected to the Congress in 1982. MacKay, during 12 years in the
Florida Legislature, seven times was honored as the ``most valuable
legislator,'' and he dominated newspaper endorsements this year in
his Senate primary and the general election.

<HEAD>Atlantans Sign Newspaper Ad Backing Editor, Plan March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 writers, professionals and community
activists signed a newspaper advertisement Thursday expressing
regret at the departure of Bill Kovach as editor of The Atlanta
Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.
   And a top political correspondent for the newspapers resigned in
protest over Kovach's departure.
   Kovach, who was Washington bureau chief of The New York Times
before he joined the Atlanta papers in 1986, resigned Nov. 4, citing
irreconcilable differences with the newspapers' management. He had
said he wanted to make the newspapers a ``world-class'' operation,
and his departure stunned the staff.
   Newsroom employees also had on Saturday signed a full-page ad
supporting Kovach.
   Novelist Pat Conroy, an Atlanta native and vocal supporter of
changes made during Kovach's tenure, helped organize Thursday's
advertisement, which also announced a march for Saturday.
   He said the 152 people who signed the ad paid its $8,200 cost.
   ``We greatly appreciate the kind of excellence Mr. Kovach strove
for and helped to produce, and we are concerned that the ready
acceptance of his resignation signals a compromise of the high
journalistic standards we have come to expect,'' the advertisement
said.
   ``What the Cox people are saying is that they hold great
journalism in contempt ... that they celebrate mediocrity and
mediocrity only,'' he said.
   Cox Enterprises publishes the Atlanta papers and others across
the country.
   Publisher Jay Smith did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.
   John Mashek, a Washington, D.C.-based political correspondent,
resigned Wednesday, newspaper officials said.
   Mashek was on the panel for the first of the two televised
debates between presidential candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis. Mashek told USA Today that he left because of the Kovach
matter, adding, ``We were on the way to building something great.
Now that dream has been shattered.''
   Managing Editor Glenn McCutchen said another reporter he did not
identify had also resigned, and his resignation letter said the
decision to leave the newspapers was made easier by the Kovach
incident.
   In addition to Conroy, signers of the ad included Bill Emerson,
former editor of The Saturday Evening Post; Gene Guerrero, executive
director of the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union; and Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., who represents Atlanta in Congress.

<HEAD>Administration Asked To Enforce Labor Rights Clause In Trade Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration should enforce a provision
in the new trade law that allows it to restrict imports from a
country which refuses to grant organizing rights to workers, an
official of the AFL-CIO said Thursday.
   ``In Thailand they shoot people who want to organize labor,''
said Henry Schecter, the AFL-CIO's deputy director of economics, in
a speech to the National Economists Club.
   He apparently was referring to the shooting in 1987 of a
provincial union official, Yod Plaeksawat. No link to an employer
has been proved in that case, but there have been many instances of
intimidation of labor organizers in Thailand, including threats to
life, according to the Asian-American Free Labor Institute, an
AFL-CIO affiliate.
   At the Thai embassy, Counselor Pradap Pibulsongram, said ``The
Thai government recognizes worker rights. Of course there are abuses
in any country, but our government does not condone them.''
   Schecter said that enforcing the labor rights provision of the
trade law ``doesn't mean that we have to stop imports. It does mean
you have to allow the same rights of organization and bargaining
that we have had.''
   Before passage of the new law, denial of labor rights had already
been the ground for denying some countries _ including Paraguay,
Chile, Romania and Nicaragua _ the right to ship some goods to the
United States without payment of duty.
   Hearings have been scheduled for next week on adding others to
the list.
   Under the new law, the president can designate an offending
country as engaging in an unfair labor practice and take further
action against its trade. The law also sets the goal of obtaining an
international agreement on labor rights.

<TEXT>
   Connie Mack III, Florida's newest senator, was born
into fame and politics, but he adopted his conservative Republican
viewpoints on his own.
   He took the nickname of grandfather Cornelius McGillicuddy,
beloved and successful owner and manager of the Philadelphia
Athletics baseball team and now in baseball's Hall of Fame. His
maternal grandfather, Morris Sheppard, and his step-grandfather, Tom
Connally, had both served as Democratic U.S. senators from Texas.
   Mack's family moved in 1951 from Philadelphia to southwest
Florida, which in the 1970s would become one of the nation's
fastest-growing areas and a conservative Republican stronghold in
Florida.
   Mack, now 48, followed a Ronald Reagan-like evolution from
liberal Democrat. He was the first president of the Lee County Young
Democrats Club in 1969, then switched parties in 1979 as he was
rising to become a bank president in Cape Coral. In 1982, enthused
by the Reagan presidency, he ran for Congress.
   He won the election against a Democrat who accused Mack of having
smoked marijuana, which Mack denied. Last year, Mack admitted he had
experimented with marijuana and apologized.
   In Congress, the lean, handsome congressman _ who notes that his
wife Priscilla is a former beautician when asked about his
inevitable description as ``blow-dried'' _ joined with other young
Republicans in the ``Conservative Opportunity Society'' led by
Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich.
   He has advocated spending cuts, fighting taxes and other
trademarks of supply-side economic policies. His anti-spending
stances have earned him dismal ratings from environmental and senior
citizens' groups.
   He has backed virtually all defense programs, and military aid to
Nicaraguan Contras and support for Afghan and Angolan rebels, while
opposing strong sanctions against South Africa.
   Mack had planned to keep his safe House seat and work for the
presidential campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp of New York until national
Republican leaders convinced him that three-term Democratic
incumbent Sen. Lawton Chiles could be beaten.
   Mack announced his candidacy in October 1987, then saw Chiles
announce in December he wouldn't seek re-election.

<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday
temporarily blocked deep cuts in auto insurance rates mandated by
voters, but the measure's author said insurance companies can't
thwart the will of the people.
   Legislative leaders might ask Gov. George Deukmejian to call a
special emergency session to deal with the uproar over the
rate-slashing measure, said Bob Forsyth, a spokesman for Senate
President Pro Tem David Roberti.
   ``The voters have spoken and they expect the state Legislature to
implement Proposition 103,'' the leaders said in a draft of a letter
to the governor.
   Proposition 103 forces insurance companies to reduce rates for
most liability policies, including those for cars, homes and
businesses, 20 percent below November 1987 rates. The rollback would
be effective when current policies are renewed.
   The measure, backed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, reduces
premiums by an additional 20 percent for motorists with clean
driving records and freezes premiums at those lower rates for at
least two years.
   California voters narrowly approved the initiative Tuesday, while
rejecting four other insurance measures sponsored by insurers and
trial lawyers.
   In response to three insurance company lawsuits claiming the
measure is unconstitutional, the high court issued an order signed
by six of seven justices staying Proposition 103 indefinitely to
allow time for consideration of the measure.
   Nearly 50 insurance companies responded to the voter revolt
against skyrocketing rates by announcing they would stop writing
certain policies in California.
   At least six other insurance companies, including Aetna Life &
Casualty and Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos., said they have withdrawn
or intend to withdraw from the auto insurance business in California.
   ``We're finding exactly what we feared, and that is there's no
marketplace left as a result of the passage of Proposition 103,''
said Don Stewart, executive director of the Pasadena-based American
Agents Alliance, a 600-member association of independent insurance
brokers and agents.
   ``The rate rollbacks that are contained in 103 will require
insurance companies to sell their products at a loss,'' said George
Tye, spokesman for the Association of California Insurance Companies.
   ``For any business, that kind of situation creates total havoc.
That's one of the points on which we're challenging the
constitutionality of Proposition 103,'' Tye said.
   But Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield said, ``It's clear
that insurance companies are now trying to shift the battle to the
courts to thwart the will of the people when they lost the battle
(in the election).''
   ``Last week, the same insurance companies were claiming the
courts were at fault for high insurance rates. Our feeling is that
the courts should look at this thing very carefully. We intend to
intervene on behalf of all the voters. I doubt very much if the
courts are going to overturn the will of the people,'' Rosenfield
said.
   Sen. Alan Robbins, a Democrat who chairs the state Senate
insurance committee, agreed that the rate rollbacks must go into
effect.
   ``The bottom line is the insurance companies are going to have to
learn to live with the rate cut sooner or later. This (legal
challenge) just postpones the inevitable,'' Robbins said.
   Proposition 103 was approved despite the insurance industry's $60
million campaign seeking its defeat and passage of its own measures.
It was the nation's most costly state political campaign ever.
   State Department of Insurance officials said consumers need not
panic about whether they will be able to renew policies or obtain
new ones.
   ``It's premature to say what is going to happen because there are
650 or 700 firms writing property-casualty business in California,''
said Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who is appointed by
the governor.
   California's insurance market is the nation's largest. Its auto
insurance rates are the nation's third highest on average, after New
Jersey and Alaska. Insurers blame the rates on huge damage awards in
court cases and the state's high medical costs.

<HEAD>EPA Finds 500 Chemicals In Air Samples At 10 Public Buildings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday its sampling of the indoor air in 10 public buildings
around the country turned up traces of more than 500 different
chemicals.
   Though the concentrations were generally small, sometimes they
reached 100 times the levels found in typical outdoor air, the
agency said.
   ``No one knows what the health effects are at those
concentrations,'' said Chris Rice, the agency's spokesman on air
pollution.
   The agency released a report on its surveys of indoor air in 1983
through 1987 in 10 buildings around the country, together with a
pamphlet of advice for homeowners on indoor air quality problems.
   The pamphlet generally advises homeowners to try to get rid of
the sources of air pollutants indoors, such as stopping smoking; to
use judicious ventilation such as kitchen exhaust fans; and not to
keep unused products that might give off contaminants, such as
leftover paints and aerosols.
   EPA has published pamphlets on particular indoor polluants
before, such as radon gas, but never on the general subject as a
whole.
   A new office building in Research Triangle Park, N.C. ``had the
highest concentrations for most of the volatile'' compounds, the
report said. ``However, by the third trip, most of the compounds had
decreased considerably.''
   The office building air was checked just after the building was
completed in 1983, one month later, and five months later.
   For example, the median concentration of a common solvent,
1,1,1-trichloroethane, dropped from 290 micrograms per cubic meter
of air just after completion to 40 micrograms five months later.
   ``Many of the volatile organics many originate from cleaning
agents'' and pesticides, the study suggested.
   Such chemicals have attracted increasing attention in recent
years as a source of ``sick building syndrome,'' responsible for
flu-like episodes among employees.
   EPA itself is the subject of a union complaint about chemicals
given off by new carpets in a section of the agency's Washington
headquarters.
   Besides the North Carolina office building, the EPA surveyed two
homes for the elderly, a public school and office building in
Washington, D.C.; a hospital and an associated nursing home in
Martinsburg, W.Va.; an office building in Fairfax, Va., a nursing
home in Worcester, Mass., and an office-and-classroom building at
Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.

<HEAD>President OKs Back Benefits for Man Who Joined WWII Navy at Age 12</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Thursday
granting a World War II veteran injured at Guadalcanal the
disability benefits he was denied by the Navy because he lied about
his age when he enlisted at age 12.
   Reagan said Calvin L. Graham ``is a veteran of Navy and Marine
Corps service who has honorably served his country.''
   Te act provides that dental injuries Graham suffered at the
Battle of Guadalcanal will be considered a permanent
service-connected disability incurred in the line of duty. It also
provides for reimbursement for costs for treatment.
   The measure also grants Graham a lump-sum payment of $4,917 in
back pay for the period from Sept. 17, 1942, to April 5, 1943, when
the Navy discovered his age and he was mustered out. He'll also get
mustering out pay and interest.
   The battle at Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomon Islands,
was a series of land and sea engagements between Allied and Japanese
forces between August 1942 and February 1943.
   Graham was aboard the USS South Dakota when shrapnel ripped
through his mouth. He contended he lost all his teeth, but was
denied mustering out benefits and was granted disability status for
only one tooth.
   The legislation gives him $18,000 for his mouth injury, in
addition to the mustering out and back pay.
   He would have received $337 in 1943 when discharged, but Rep.
Martin Frost, D-Texas, insisted that the Fort Worth veteran be
compensated in 1988 dollars with interest.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, testified on Graham's behalf
at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing, and the bill was passed
in the most recent Congress.
   Graham's long quest to gain his disability benefits got a boost
when he became the subject of a recent CBS television movie, ``Too
Young the Hero.''

<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. pleaded guilty Thursday to
three counts of mischarging the Army on a $9.2 million contract and
agreed to pay $810,600 in fines and other penalties.
   The action presented for the first time Thursday in U.S. District
Court involved mischarges and misallocation of labor charges
stemming from a five-year computer software contract between Sperry
Corp., a predecessor of Unisys, and the Army's Information Systems
Command at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Ariz., said assistant U.S.
Attorney Gary Korn.
   Under the plea agreement, Unisys was assessed $250,000 in
criminal penalties, $250,000 in civil restitution, $250,000 in civil
double damages, $60,000 as full payment for the government's
investigative costs and $600 in special assessments.
   The improper activities occurred at Sperry's Technical Services
Division office in Sierra Vista, the government and Unisys said.
   Korn said the local manager directed employees to charge the Army
for work done under one delivery order to a subsequent order.
   When the company reached the spending ceiling on a given order,
it should have stopped work or asked the Army whether to stop or
finish, and for additional money, Korn said.
   ``They never did that,'' Korn said, saying the motive was the
need to avoid exceeding estimated costs to keep getting the contract
renewed annually.
   Andrew D. Hendry, Unisys vice president and general counsel,
pleaded guilty on the company's behalf to three felony false-claims
charges in which it misallocated labor charges totaling $250,000 in
1985, 1986 and early 1987.
   Korn said the mischarging amounted to overcharging ``in the sense
that they didn't ask for more money and went and spent it anyway.''
   The case was presented to U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby
following a 1{-year investigation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright and other Democratic
leaders said Thursday they will back Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, for the chairmanship of the House Banking Committee.
   The endorsement all but guarantees that the 72-year-old Gonzalez,
a 27-year veteran of Congress from San Antonio, will take over the
committee at a critical time: during the debate over a taxpayer
bailout of the fund that insures the nation's savings institutions.
   The current chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., lost
his re-election bid Tuesday after his opponent made a campaign issue
out of Justice Department allegations that St Germain accepted
thousands of dollars in entertainment from savings industry
lobbyists.
   Wright, at a news conference, said Democratic leaders met
Thursday afternoon and unanimously decided to support Gonzalez as St
Germain's replacement when the House Democratic Caucus meets on Dec.
6.
   ``The united position of the Democratic leadership is that Henry
B. Gonzalez deserves that opportunity, is well-qualified and will be
a fine chairman,'' said Wright, a fellow Texan.
   Others at the leadership meeting were House Majority Leader
Thomas S. Foley of Washington, Majority Whip Tony Coelho of
California, Deputy Whip David E. Bonior of Michigan, Beryl Anthony
Jr. of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee; Budget Committee Chairman William Gray of Pennsylvania
and Democratic Caucus Secretary Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio.
   Ms. Oakar is also a member of the Banking Committee and had been
mentioned as a possible alternative to Gonzalez.
   Some members of the Banking Committee have been reluctant to
support Gonzalez, who has a reputation as a maverick and has been
more involved in housing issues than in mainstream banking issues.
   Also, they favored a chairman representing a home district with a
less direct interest in the resolution of the savings and loan
crisis. The industry's worst losses are concentrated in Texas and
Gonzalez has said he favors an immediate $50 billion expenditure
from the Treasury as the most effective and least costly solution in
the long run.
   Other Democrats on the Banking Committee expressing an interest
in the job were Reps. Frank Annunzio of Illinois, John La Falce of
New York and Stephen Neal of North Carolina. Rep. Doug Barnard of
Georgia also was mentioned as a possibility.
   However, Annunzio and Neal said they would only accept the
position if Gonzalez didn't get it and aides for the others said
they were unlikely to buck the leadership.
   The other big question facing the committee next year will be the
proposed relaxation of barriers between the banking and securities
industries. Gonzalez has approached the issue cautiously, expressing
skepticism about deregulating too quickly.

   President Reagan signed on Thursday a bill
outlawing firearms capable of passing through detection devices

   The measure prohibits manufacture, import, sale or posession of

   Violators will be subject to $250,000 in fines for individuals

terms of up to 5 years for violators.
   The legislation exempts the military and intelligence agencies.

<HEAD>Britain and Iran Resume Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Iran restored full diplomatic relations
Thursday, renewing hopes for the release of British hostages held by
pro-Iranian Islamic extremists in Lebanon.
   Relations between the two countries soured in May 1987 after an
Iranian envoy was arrested on shoplifting charges in Manchester,
northern England, and a British diplomat was assaulted by militants
in Tehran.
   The Foreign Office announced the resumption of ties Thursday
following talks in Vienna between Sir David Myers, assistant
undersecretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, and Dr. Mahmoud
Vaezi, director general of Iran's Foreign Ministry.
   Mohammad Basti, Iran's charge d'affaires in Britain and the sole
Iranian diplomat here during the breakdown in ties, hinted that the
thaw between the two nations could speed the release of three
British hostages in Lebanon.
   Speaking in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp., Basti said the hostage issue had not come up in negotiations.
But he added: ``If you are trying to imply that the new relationship
between Iran and Britain may contribute to that end, I'm not going
to deny that.''
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, whose envoy Terry Waite
disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to negotiate
freedom for two American hostages, said:
   ``Certainly this cannot do any harm. We must wait and see. This
is welcome news. After all the purpose of this diplomacy is to make
it easy for governments to talk to each other.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told the BBC there was ``no
bargain or secret agenda.'' But he said the thaw in relations
enabled Britain ``more effectively to press the case at every
opportunity for the Iranians to use all the influence they have got
to secure the release of hostages.''
   ``Whether that will produce an improvement in the position of the
hostages I cannot say,'' Howe said. ``I don't want to raise false
hopes.''
   In June 1987, Britain withdrew its diplomats from Tehran, closed
Iran's consulate in Manchester and cut its London embassy staff to
one.
   Three months later, an Iranian attack on a British tanker in the
Persian Gulf prompted Britain to close the London office from which
Iran was running a worldwide arms-purchasing operation for its war
against Iraq.
   A Foreign Office statement Thursday said Iran and Britain had
decided to resume full diplomatic representation ``with immediate
effect based on reciprocity, mutual respect and non-interference in
each others' affairs.''
   A diplomatic source in London, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in each
country to assume posts over the next several months.
   He said an application had been made to Iranian authorities for a
visa for Gordon Pirie, a 51-year-old diplomat, who would become
Britain's temporary charge d'affaires.
   Howe said Britain would have a charge d'affaires in Iran within a
few weeks, and an exchange of ambassadors ``within hopefully six
months of that.''
   British officials said the Manchester consulate could resume
activity but would not regain extraterritorial status, and the arms
procurement office would remain shut.
   Fourteen foreigners _ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman
and an Italian _ are missing in Lebanon.
   Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted in March
1985.
   Northern Ireland teacher Brian Keenan, who holds both British and
Irish nationality, disappeared in Beirut April 11, 1986, and British
television journalist John McCarthy disappeared six days later.
   A Palestinian terrorist group claimed to have executed Alec
Collett, 64, a New York-based British journalist who was kidnapped
March 25, 1985, but his body was not found.

   The International Monetary Fund announced today
that it is granting the west African republic of Ghana a loan of
$497 million under its new, easier terms for the poorest countries.
   Interest will be at only 0.5 percent, instead of the usual 6 to 7
percent or more, and there will be a 5 1@2 year grace period
during which only interest need be paid. Ghana will get 10 years to
repay the principal.
   It will get the new money in six semi-annual disbursements, which
can be suspended if Ghana fails to meet agreed conditions.
   Ghana already owes the fund $628 million.
   The fund did not announce the details of its conditions, but said
the government of Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings has undertaken to speed
up ``structural reforms.'' It added that the government is also
trying to help the country's poorest and most vulnerable groups.

   Thousands of anti-government
demonstrators defied curfews in the Sinhalese heartland Thursday and
soldiers opened fire, killing at least 15, a military spokesman said.
   Thirty people were injured, including three soldiers, said the
spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules. He said
the injured soldiers were hit by rocks and bottles.
   Soldiers and armored cars stood guard in Colombo, the capital, as
three Sinhalese politicians declared their candidacies for president
of this island off southern India, which has been plagued by five
years of ethnic civil war.
   More than 8,500 people have been killed in a Tamil insurrection
that began in 1983 and extremist anti-government have sprung up
among the majority Sinhalese.
   Militants in the Tamil minority, a predominantly Hindu ethnic
group making up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, are
fighting for a separate homeland because of alleged discrimination
in jobs and education.
   Sinhalese control the government, military and judiciary. Most
Sinhalese are Buddhists and they constitute 75 percent of the
population.
   No demonstrations were reported in Colombo, where troops
patrolled the streets.
   But demonstrators in three southern districts defied
around-the-clock curfews and marched through the streets demanding
President Junius R. Jayewardene and his government step down before
the Dec. 19 presidential elections.
   Jayewardene is not running for re-election, but Sinhalese
extremists claim his government is incapable of conducting fair
elections.
   The military spokesman said at least five people were killed in
each of the three districts: Tangalle, a coastal town 100 miles
southeast of Colombo; Tissmaharama, near the coast 40 miles
northeast of Tangalle; and Monaragala, an inland town 40 miles north
of Tissmaharama.
   The army shootings were the first reported instances of soldiers
using the shoot-on-sight orders issued Wednesday to prevent
anti-government demonstrations.
   In Colombo, soldiers in armored cars blocked streets leading to
the town hall where nomination papers were presented for next
month's presidential election. About 1,000 armed policemen stood
guard.
   Dozens of bodyguards, some wearing bulletproof vests, surrounded
the three candidates: former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike,
leader of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party; Minister
Ramasinghe Premadasa, the candidate of Jayewardene's United National
Party; and Ossie Abeygoonesekera of the United Socialist Alliance, a
three-party coalition.
   The People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group, is
at the vanguard of the anti-government protests.
   It stepped up its opposition to Jayewardene on Monday by
launching a four-day strike that has shut down businesses and
transportation across much of the island, caused shortages of fuel
and food and prompted thousands of foreign tourists to cut short
their vacations.
   At least 9,000 tourists, mostly from Western Europe, were
evacuated from beach resorts south of Colombo on Tuesday after their
hotels received warnings from the front to close their doors or face
attacks.
   The government has blamed the People's Liberation Front for the
deaths of at least 550 people, mostly Sinhalese supporters of the
government, in the last 15 months.
   The front opposes Jayewardene's peace overtures to guerrillas
from the Tamil ethnic minority. Under an Indian-brokered accord
signed July 29, 1987, Sri Lanka offered Tamils a measure of autonomy
if the guerrillas surrendered their weapons.
   The most powerful Tamil groups rejected the accord and have
continued their attacks on civilians as well as on an Indian
peacekeeping force sent to implement the accord.

   The Justice Department has declined to seek
civil fines from Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., for filing
allegedly faulty financial disclosure reports, a spokesman said
Thursday.
   St Germain, chairman of the House Banking Committee, was soundly
defeated Tuesday in his bid for a 15th term in Congress in a race
that political observers said was affected by continuing controversy
over his ethics.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown said that after a five-month review
by the department's Civil Division, ``the determination has been
made not to bring a lawsuit under the civil penalty provisions of
the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics in Government
Act.''
   She declined to specify why the division reached that decision.
   The Civil Division's review of the case, not previously disclosed
to the public, began late last May just after the department's
Criminal Division announced that it would not bring criminal charges
against St Germain for allegedly failing to disclose that he had
accepted meals and entertainment from savings and loan industry
lobbyists.
   The Ethics in Government Act imposes a $5,000 civil fine on
anyone who knowingly and willfully falsifies or fails to file
required financial disclosure forms. The Justice Department has
brought four such civil suits in the past. It has filed only one
criminal case, resulting in the conviction of former Rep. George
Hansen of Idaho, under the disclosure provisions of the act.
   The Civil Division routinely considers whether to file a civil
suit after disclosure cases have been reviewed by the Criminal
Division.
   Ms. Brown said the civil division had reviewed the reporting
practices of other House and Senate committee chairmen as part of
its consideration of the St Germain case.
   She said Steven Kaufman, a summer law clerk in the Civil
Division's federal programs branch, had been assigned to ``conduct a
sampling of Hill disclosure forms to determine what the practices
were in terms of reporting.''
   She said Kaufman pulled copies last July of at least 100 forms,
including all Senate and House committee chairmen for each year back
through 1984 and some subcommittee chairmen.
   Kaufman's search has been erroneously attributed to the FBI in
some published reports.
   St Germain, the first House committee chairman to be defeated at
the polls since Oregon voters turned out Ways and Means committee
chairman Al Ullman in 1960, was defeated by Ron Machtley, a
40-year-old lawyer from Newport and political neophyte.
   Eight days before the election, a federal court here unsealed
portions of a letter sent on May 31 by John C. Keeney, acting
Justice Criminal Division chief, to the House Ethics Committee.
Keeney's letter referred for commitee review evidence gathered by
the department and said, ``Substantial evidence of serious and
sustained misconduct'' on the part of St Germain had been found
during the Justice probe.
   The day after the election, St Germain was hospitalized at
Newport Hospital in Rhode Island with a skin infection on his leg.
Hospital spokeswoman Sandra King said Thursday the congressman's
release would depend on his response to medication and the outcome
of certain tests.

<HEAD>Wright Won't Prejudge Bush's `Flexible Freeze' Concept</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright said Thursday he's not
sure what President-elect George Bush means by his ``flexible
freeze'' idea to cut the federal budget deficit, but he will keep an
open mind when Bush comes to Congress with details of the proposal.
   Bush advanced the flexible freeze concept during the presidential
election campaign as an answer to how the nation can meet its
financial obligations while cutting the tide of red ink. He said he
would limit spending on all programs except Social Security to 4
percent or the rate of inflation.
   The concept drew reactions ranging from ridicule to curiosity in
Congress, which will have to find a way of saving about $32 billion
next year to meet the target specified by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction act.
   ``I'm not sure I understand exactly what those two words
define,'' Wright said when asked about the flexible freeze concept.
   He said if Bush means that total federal spending growth will be
limited to the amount of inflation and that budget pie then will be
divided according to an agreement reached by Congress and the
administration, ``then that is one part of a solution.''
   ``It isn't a total solution, because obviously the amount we have
been spending in the past has exceeded the amount the government
takes in revenue,'' he added. That alone wouldn't lead to a balanced
budget, he said.
   ``I have an open mind, and I'm willing to listen to the
president's refinement of exactly how he interprets the meaning of
that phrase.''
   Wright made his comments to reporters following a meeting at
which the House Democratic leadership began mapping strategy for the
101st Congress. The Congress convenes in January.
   Asked whether Bush can achieve the necessary deficit reduction
without breaking his ``read my lips'' pledge not to raise taxes,
Wright said: ``That is a difficult question. I suppose he must have
in his mind some proposal, and I eagerly await it.''
   But he said Bush's oft-repeated, anti-tax pledge did not amount
to a mandate from the voters. ``I don't think the mandate is so
strong for any of the specific things the president-elect has said.''
   The first signal about whether Bush is serious about attacking
the deficit may well come from whom he appoints as his two members
of the National Economic Commission, a bipartisan group constituted
last year to craft a politically palatable solution to the budget
crisis.
   Bush criticized the commission during the campaign as a device to
push a tax increase, but Wright said the two appointments to which
Bush is entitled will speak louder.
   ``Will they be pragmatic people? Will they be realistic people?
Will they be people dedicated to finding a true solution to this
enormous budget crisis?'' Wright said. ``Will they be people who
want us to pay as we go? I think that may be his first signal. But
we'll await that signal.''
   Wright repeatedly refused to offer his own view on how to make
the needed savings, saying proposing a new budget will be Bush's
prerogative.
   ``I owe it to him not to prejudge or pre-empt him, but wait
patiently for the program he will offer,'' Wright said.
   Wright said he hoped Bush ``truly desires a gentler, kinder
climate of public discourse, civil debate. ... I shall not be the
first to break that truce.''
   If there is a mandate in Bush's election and the bolstering of
Democratic control of the Congress, Wright said, it is for both ``to
continue and build upon the constructive program that we embarked
upon last year and the year before.''

<HEAD>Law Judge Finds Boston Landing Fee Plan Discriminatory</HEAD>

   A federal administrative judge ruled Thursday
that stiff landing fees aimed at keeping smaller aircraft out of
Boston's Logan Airport violate federal aviation law because they are
discriminatory and unfair.
   A final decision on how to deal with the fee structure imposed
last summer by the Massachusetts Port Authority rests with the
Transportation Department, to whom administrative law judge Burton
S. Kolko made his recommendations.
   The case has been seen within the aviation industry as a test
over how much power the federal government intends to allow local
officials and airport operators in dealing with air traffic
congestion.
   A DOT spokesman said the department will decide by Dec. 17
whether to uphold Kolko's decision or come down with an alternative
finding on the Boston airport fees, which have raised a storm of
protests among private and business pilots and in the commuter
airline industry.
   Kolko in his decision said the Logan fees ``are lacking in
economic justification ... not fair and reasonable (and) are
unjustly discriminatory'' toward private aircraft and smaller
commuter planes.
   The judge said that Massport officials acted in violation of
federal aviation laws and he concluded that the Transportation
Department has legal grounds on which to take pre-emptive action to
have the fees revoked.
   Massport officials said that since the fee structure has been in
place, Logan has handled more passengers with fewer delays.
   ``It is unsettling then, that all the benefits ... could be
dismantled if DOT accepts the recommendations issued today,'' the
company said.
   The Transportation Department announced last summer that it
planned to closely examine the so-called ``Pace Program'' enacted at
Logan to curtail the volume of air traffic in and out of the busy
Boston airport.
   After loud protests from private pilots and some commuter
airlines, Congress included in its DOT appropriations legislation
earlier this year a provision ordering the department to stop
airport construction money for Logan if it concludes the fees
violate aviation law and are not rescinded.
   Massport approved the higher landing fees for small aircraft last
March, saying Logan's capacity ``is a finite resource, which must be
managed wisely and efficiently in order to keep people moving with a
minimum of delay.''
   The airport's operators said they wanted to use Logan's limited
capacity for airliner traffic and not private aircraft, maintaining
that a large jetliner with up to 400 people aboard ``deserves a
higher priority than a Cessna with two people on board.''
   The new fee structure went into effect in July after a U.S.
district judge ruled that the fees were not discriminatory.
   The higher fees have affected both private pilots and commuter
airlines. The government said some commuter services were
discontinued to Logan after the new fees went into effect, but that
most commuters just passed the higher costs on to air travelers.
   While the conclusion Thursday by Kolko is little more than a
recommendation to senior department officials on whether to take
administrative action, it was hailed by private pilot groups and
other critics of the Logan fees.
   John Baker, president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association, called the law judge's decision ``well reasoned'' and
said, ``It makes it clear once and for all this country has a
national aviation system that must be regulated by appropriate
federal authority.''
   Jonathan Howe, head of the National Business Aircraft
Association, said his group now ``looks forward to .. the final
determination'' on the Massport fees by Deputy Secretary Mimi Dawson
next month.
   ``The entire aviation community was gratified'' by Kolko's
findings, said Edward W. Stimpson, president of the General Aviation
Manufacturers Association, the trade group that represents builders
of small aircraft.

   An explosion in an underground sewerage tunnel
Thursday killed three workers who fled when methane gas built up,
but then returned to check the gas level.
   The deaths were the fourth, fifth and sixth fatalities in four
deadly accidents on the tunnel project. The contractor in March was
cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for
unsafe conditions, including poor ventilation.
   Rescue crews were hampered by high levels of methane in the
tunnel under construction 40 feet below ground, and special
equipment had to be brought in to remove the gas and pump fresh air
into the search area, said Deputy Fire Chief Norm Luedke.
   The bodies of two workers were found about 2 p.m., five hours
after the explosion or explosions, said Pat Freeman, corporate
safety director for project contractor S.A. Healy Co. The third was
found a short time later.
   ``One of them was a real good friend of mine,'' Freeman said, his
voice quivering.
   The company identified the victims as Ron Kohne, of Big Sandy,
Tenn., a tunnel superintendent; Tony Bell, of Sturgeon Bay, a shift
foreman; and Rick Sochacki, of South Holland, Ill., a safety
officer. All were believed to be in their 30s or 40s.
   After the explosion, two rescue crews moved about 1,200 feet into
the tunnel, but they turned back on detecting methane levels of 6
percent, said Luedke, who heads the department's tunnel rescue unit.
Any reading above 4 percent is considered dangerous, he said.
   They returned when fresh air was pumped in and discovered the
bodies.
   The dead workers were trapped approximately 2,000 feet into the
tunnel, said Deputy Fire Chief Orville Peterson.
   Patrick Doig, project manager for S.A. Healy, said 10 men were in
the tunnel when a monitoring device showed high levels of methane.
All of the men left the tunnel, he said, and then three men went
back in to check gas levels. That was when the explosion occurred,
he said.
   The three had hand-held methane detectors, but it was not known
immediately whether they had breathing equipment with them, he added.
   Freeman said he believed the methane that caused the explosion
was naturally occurring, from decayed organic matter.
   The collector sewer near the accident site had been evacuated
repeatedly in the last week because of unsafe levels of methane,
said Chuck Kennedy, a resident engineer with the sewerage district
program.
   S.A. Healy, of McCook, Ill., which is building the sewer under
contract with the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, was
cited March 17 by OSHA.
   OSHA Director Gerald Cunningham called the violation serious and
the company was fined $620 for not providing adequate ventilation in
part of a tunnel and for failing to ground electrical equipment.
   Three workers were killed in the tunnel prior to Thursday, giving
Milwaukee the worst fatality record in the nation per dollar spent
on a deep tunnel project, said Joseph McKinney, executive director
of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago.
   One man was crushed to death in a conveyor system, another was
struck in the head by a falling rock and the third fell 156 feet
from a cage to the bottom of a tunnel air shaft.
   Chicago has had 10 fatalities on its deep tunnel project and
Cleveland has had three, Kinney said. But both projects are further
along in contruction, he noted.
   Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District spokeswoman Rosemary
Murphy said the tunnel construction is part of a $2.1 billion
project that will expand sewage collection and treatment of waste.

<HEAD>Three House Contests Undecided But Leaning 2-1 to the Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The makeup of next year's Congress remained in doubt Thursday,
with three House races in New York, Florida and Oregon still
undecided. Democrats had the lead in two of the contests, but
recounts won't be finished until later this month.
   Regardless of the outcome, Democrats will keep a solid hold on
the 435-seat House, with a definite 259 seats to the Republicans'
certain 173. If the 2-1 split in the undecided House seats holds,
the Democrats will have picked up four seats between the 100th
Congress that adjourned last month and the 101st session that begins
in January.
   While some 98 percent of the House incumbents seeking re-election
were victorious, all three of those trailing in the undecided
contests were incumbents.
   In serious trouble in Florida's 4th Congressional District, was
Democratic Rep. Bill Chappell, a 20-year veteran of the House whose
ties to the defense industry have come under scrutiny.
   With absentee ballots tallied, Chappell finished 727 votes behind
lawyer Craig James, the GOP candidate for the district that
stretches from Jacksonville past Daytona Beach.
   Final unofficial results gave James 125,394 votes to 124,667 for
Chappell, leaving his only hope a recount. Under Florida law, this
is required if the margin of difference between the candidates is
less than one-half of 1 percent.
   Five of the six counties in the district began recounting ballots
Thursday afternoon and expected to finish Thursday night, but
Flagler County Supervisor of Elections Etta Peterson said the
recount in her county would not begin until Monday morning.
   ``Unless there is some kind of gross error, I would expect it to
remain the same and I expect to be the congressman,'' said the
47-year James, an attorney and real estate agent. ``If the counters
did their job, I'm the winner.''
   Chappell, 66, has not commented on the race since late Tuesday.
   The congressman has been chairman of the powerful House defense
appropriations subcommittee that oversees billions of dollars each
year in defense spending.
   Although he has not been accused of any crimes or indicted,
published reports have linked him to a federal investigation into
Pentagon procurement practices. Armtec, a small defense contractor
he brought to Palatka, was raided by the FBI last summer as part of
the federal investigation.
   In New York's Westchester County, Democrat Nita Lowey, making her
first run for political office, led two-term Republican Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi by 2,594 votes with 95 percent of the voting machines and
about a third of the absentee ballots tallied. The unofficial count
in the 20th Congressional District gave Lowey 92,663 votes to 90,069
for DioGuardi.
   Lowey, 51, who served as an assistant New York secretary of
state, declared victory Tuesday night, but DioGuardi, 48, refused to
concede, although he said it would be ``an uphill battle'' to
overcome her lead.
   He said he owed it to his supporters to get a full count and
would allow a recount to go ahead until the numbers proved his loss
beyond a doubt. Board of Elections officials said the entire process
could take two weeks.
   The Democrats also were ahead in Oregon, where challenger Mike
Kopetski was separated from Republican incumbent Denny Smith in the
5th Congressional District by 1,304 votes.
   With absentee ballots still to be counted in two counties,
Kopetski tallied 104,038, compared to 102,734 for Smith.
   Officials in Marion County said they should complete counting of
absentee ballots Thursday. Clackamas County, with about 16,000
absentees, is not expected to complete its count until late Friday.
   Neither Smith, a four-term incumbent, nor Kopetski, a state
representative, has declared victory.
   ``Obviously, we're not very happy where we're sitting,'' said
Dave Henderson, Smith's campaign manager.

   NASA put up $7 million conditionally to
enable the sole supplier of a key material used in the space shuttle
and some defense rockets to reopen a plant Thursday, officials said.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the
money will either get Avtex Fibers Inc. back on its feet or give the
space agency the rights to an Avtex rayon fiber needed in the space
shuttle and other rockets.
   If Avtex can demonstrate by Nov. 18 that it will get enough other
contracts to keep its Front Royal plant in business, NASA will then
take out an $11 million contract for enough of the fiber for 12
shuttle launches, said J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``I don't look at it as a bailout, because every time we give
them something, they give us something in return,'' Thompson said.
``We're not in the bailout business.''
   One week ago, Avtex abruptly shut down all production at its
aging mill in Front Royal, citing stiff foreign competition for its
other products and environmental regulations that have led to
numerous pollution problems.
   The sudden announcement sent NASA and the Department of Defense
scrambling to determine the impact on the shuttle and an array of
military missiles that use Avtex's carbonizable rayon fiber to form
rocket nozzles. Avtex is the only company certified to produce the
fiber.
   Aerospace contractors met last week in Salt Lake City with Avtex
to look for a solution. NASA officials met Monday with Avtex
officials at the Philadelphia airport, Thompson said.
   After NASA pays Avtex the initial $7 million, ``They transfer the
rights to NASA as well as the cookbook to making this rayon fiber to
our technical specifications,'' Thompson said.
   Before NASA will give the Valley Forge, Pa.-based Avtex the $11
million contract for 1.1 million pounds of the fiber, Avtex will
have to show that it can find other contracts to make itself
solvent, Thompson said.
   ``They have to come up with others,'' Thompson said. ``We are not
doing the whole thing by any means.''
   By Wednesday afternoon, Avtex Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer John N. Gregg was confident enough that a deal would be
reached that he told the Front Royal plant's 1,300 employees to
report for work Thursday. Gregg, who has refused to return repeated
phone calls from The Associated Press, told Winchester radio station
WINC on Thursday that when he told workers to come back, he had no
deal in hand.
   ``We took a risk that we were making progress and that things
that had not been resolved would be resolved,'' Gregg said.
   Gregg said he cut the deal with NASA on Wednesday night.
   ``We signed a contract with them and we signed a contract for
some medical specialty fibers, and those enabled us to really put
together a good business,'' Gregg said. He would not provide the
dollar amount for the contracts.
   ``I think we're in a very secure position, probably the best
position we've been in in a number of years,'' Gregg said.
   Thompson dismissed the suggestion that Avtex had suddenly
announced its closing, complete with overstated information on how
the shuttle would be affected, with the intention of pressuring the
government into funding a bailout.
   ``My honest opinion is they felt like they were just strapped and
felt like they were going to shut down,'' Thompson said.
   Such dependence of a single supplier is not uncommon in the
aerospace industry, said analyst Mary E. O'Neill of Duff & Phelps.
   ``It's so specialized _ there's not a commercial market out there
for rockets,'' she said. ``There's not perfect competition, but
there's not perfect competition in a lot of markets.''
   Paul Nisbet of Prudential Bache Securities Inc. agreed.
   ``We've got a lot of areas in the whole aerospace and military
industries where there are a lot of potential problems if sources
disappear from view,'' Nisbet said.
   Avtex employees returned to work Thursday. Officials of the
Almalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union met with management
and said the company promised business as usual.
   Asked about the mood of the rank and file, James Brinklow,
business agent of union local 371-T, said, ``Some of them are right
happy and some are not.''
   Some workers have already found other jobs and others said they
won't return to the plant because of its history of worker-safety
and environmental violations.

<HEAD>Norway May Halt Heavy Water Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister said Thursday that
Norway may stop exporting heavy water, used in producing nuclear
weapons, following reports that a shipment intended for West Germany
was diverted to India.
   Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament that it was the Cabinet's
intention to ban the exports, although ``the issue has not yet been
handled and approved by the government.''
   Norway refuses to sell the water to India, which has tested
nuclear devices, because India has not signed the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
   Investigators said last week that the diverted shipment of
Norwegian heavy water arrived in India in 1982 around the same time
as a supply of Soviet heavy water, which made it difficult to trace.
   Stoltenberg said the legal basis for banning future sales could
be found in an export control bill passed last year, the national
NTB news agency reported. He said he was discussing the issue with
Trade Minister Jan Balstad.
   Heavy water is used as a coolant in some nuclear reactors. It
also can be used in the chemical process turning uranium into
plutonium for nuclear explosives.
   The water is made by Norsk Hydro as a byproduct in its fertilizer
production. Norway has exported about 450 tons of heavy water to
nearly 40 countries since the 1930s. Annual production has fallen to
about two tons.

   Strong winds from Canada hit the northeastern United States on
Thursday, downing power lines and trees and blowing out windows in
some areas, while snow fell in higher elevations in the West.
   Winds in western New York gusted to 63 mph at Youngstown, 68 mph
at Buffalo, 69 mph at Niagara Falls, and 78 mph at Brockport. In the
Midwest, winds gusted to 58 mph at Cleveland and to 53 mph at Erie,
Pa.
   Storm warnings were in effect for Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A
gale warning also was in effect for Lake Huron and along the coasts
of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, southern New Jersey, New Hampshire
and Maine.
   Showers and thundershowers extended from New York through West
Virginia to the coast of Texas.
   Showers extended from the northern and central Pacific Coast to
the northern Rockies, with snow in some high elevations. Up to 4
inches of new snow had fallen in the mountain passes of the Sierra
Nevada range. In Colorado's mountains, up to 8 inches of snow was
expected.
   The south-central states had sunny skies. Temperatures were above
70 degrees from south-central Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast,
with readings in the 80s across southern Florida and along the
western Gulf Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 27
degrees at Devils Lake, N.D., and Dickinson, N.D., to 89 degrees at
Kingsville, Texas. The low for the nation Thursday morning was 8
degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Friday, the National Weather Service forecast showers and
thunderstorms extending from central and eastern Texas to the middle
Missouri Valley, and showers from the northern and central Pacific
Coast to the northern and central Rockies, with snow showers in the
higher elevations. Rain showers were expected to be numerous across
Washington and Oregon. Scattered rain and snow were predicted from
New York to Maine.
   High temperatures were expected to be mostly in the 40s from the
northern Pacific Coast through the northern and central Plateau
region and across Nebraska and the Dakotas to northern New England.
Temperatures should be above 70 degrees from the Southwest deserts
across southern and central Texas to Florida and southern Georgia,
80s in Florida and south-central and southeastern Texas, and
generally in the 50s and 60s elsewhere in the nation.

   The government protested to Cuba on Thursday
about its refusal to allow a European human rights delegation into
the country, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   The president of the Argentine Committee on Human Rights in Cuba
said immigration officials in Havana also refused to let her into
Cuba and put her on a plane back to Mexico City.
   Senators Loyola del Palacio and Javier Camara, and Maria Paz
Martinez Prieto, head of the Spanish Committee on Human Rights in
Cuba, were part of the delegation that arrived in Havana on
Wednesday.
   Ms. del Palacio said they were frisked by soldiers, photographed
and pushed onto a plane for the return trip.
   ``We were repeatedly punched, pushed around, had our hair pulled,
then were shoved around,'' she said.
   The Cuban Embassy in Madrid described the trip as a
``provocation.''
   Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina said the visit from the
``so-called'' human rights group was a ``new type of aggression'' by
the United States.
   ``It was an apparently noble mission, but the theme of human
rights is like a Trojan horse in the current confrontation (between
Cuban and the United States),'' said a Prensa Latina dispatch
monitored in Mexico City.
   Granma, Cuba's official Communist Party newspaper, said
``Provocateurs penetrated our country, agents of the CIA,'' in the
guise of tourists.
   Maria Teresa Reviriego of the Argentine committee, said she was
told she needed a special visa because of her human rights
affiliation and the refusal to admit her ``shows a fear on the part
of the government.''
   ``On the visa application I put the reason for my visit was to
know Cuban and the Cuban people,'' she said. ``That's the truth. Why
would you need a special visa for that?''
   She said she would apply for a special visa Friday at the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City.
   Ms. Martinez Prieto quoted a Cuban official at the Havana airport
as saying he had ``reason to believe'' the visit was suspect because
former Cuban dissident Armando Valladares, U.S. representative to
the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, was seen with the
delegation at Madrid's airport.
   Granma also mentioned Valladares being at the Madrid airport and
said the visitors planned to ``orchestrate'' an ``anti-Cuban show.''
   Prensa Latina said Radio Marti, the U.S. government station that
broadcasts to Cuba, had been carrying advance reports on the visit
for five months.

<HEAD>Boston Whalers Selling From Canada To Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To boaters, a Boston Whaler is instantly
identifiable by its ``smirk,'' a horizontal crease in the bow of
every one of the 165,000 boats that the company has sold since its
founding in 1958.
   Today, however, the Boston Whaler Co. has more justification than
ever for that smirk.
   The simple, sturdy, decidedly unsexy Whaler has succeeded this
year in transferring its appeal from the recreational boating market
to the commercial market, winning customers as diverse as the U.S.
Marines, the Bangladesh ambulance corps and the kingdom of Saudi
Arabia.
   Last week, the company announced it had won a $2.7 million
contract to produce 32 military patrol boats for Saudi Arabia. Two
of the 27-foot fiberglass launches are to be customized for King
Fahd and a mosque.
   Each of the king's two launches will have twin 300-horsepower
outboard motors, an outsized powerplant that can push a Whaler to
more than 50 miles per hour.
   The 30 other boats, costing $80,000 a piece, will be equipped
with sirens, radar, machine gun mounts and 225-horsepower motors.
   The Saudia Arabian contract, which required State Department
approval, came on the heels of a $5 million contract to manufacture
122 small landing craft for the Marines.
   Boston Whalers also are standard equipment for the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Coast Guard. And the
company has sold boats to government agencies in Asia and the
Caribbean.
   ``It's amazing,'' said company spokesman Paul D. Foster. ``I
don't know how these people find out about us. But I know there are
Boston Whalers being used as ambulances in Bangladesh, patrol boats
in Macao _ all over.''
   For 30 years, the humble Boston Whaler has been a hot-selling
pleasure boat for one main reason: it is virtually unsinkable.
   That trait is a result of the boat's composite construction, a
sandwich of buoyant foam in fiberglass. It is a characteristic that
appeals particularly to novice or safety-conscious boaters, and one
the company has trumpeted in a series of sensational advertisements.
   In one ad, a Boston Whaler remains afloat even though it has been
cut in half. In another, the boat does not sink, even when a crane
lowers a Volvo sedan onto it.
   That seaworthiness makes the Boston Whaler a natural for military
patrols and coastal surveillance. But until the early 1980s, the
company sold virtually all of its boats to fishermen, water-skiers
and other pleasure boat users.
   Only in the last five years has Boston Whaler made a substantial
move into the commercial market, which now accounts for about 20
percent of its $66 million in annual sales, according to Foster.
   Headquartered in Rockland, Mass., about 15 miles southeast of
Boston, Boston Whaler has about 650 employees producing 5,500 boats
a year.
   It is owned by CML Co., a publicly traded firm that also owns
retail stores and clothing catalogs, including The Nature Co.,
Carroll Reed, and Britches of Georgetown.
   While Boston Whalers range in size from 9 to 31 feet and in price
from $2,300 to $127,000, all have the same basic foam and fiberglass
construction, making them virtual life rafts.
   ``The ads are real eye-catchers,'' said Foster. ``But they're
also true.''

   Incumbent Gov. Rafael Hernandez
Colon, the pro-commonwealth candidate, maintained his lead Thursday
over statehood advocate Baltasar Corrada del Rio, according to
nearly complete election results.
   With only 12 polling centers uncounted for out of a total of
1,754, Hernandez Colon had 861,716 votes, or 48.7 percent. Corrada
del Rio, the former mayor of San Juan, had 809,932 for 45.8 percent.
Independence Party candidate Ruben Berrios Martinez had 95,756, or
5.4 percent.
   In the capital of San Juan, the race for mayor was still
undecided because there was only a difference of 559 votes between
the two main candidates. A recount was to begin next Monday.
   Mayoral candidate Hector Luis Acevedo of the Popular Democratic
Party, running on the governor's ticket, had 98,858 votes. New
Progressive Party candidate Jose Granados Navedo had 98,299 votes.
Independence Party candidate Ana Maria Corrada, the former mayor's
sister, had 8,123 votes.
   About 2 million people, more than 80 percent of Puerto Rico's
eligible voters, cast ballots in Tuesday's elections.
   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but cannot vote for president.
The Caribbean island has been a U.S. commonwealth for 36 years.
   Hernandez Colon, 51, favors maintaining Puerto Rico's
commonwealth status. He has said he wants to maintain the strong
ties with the United States but wants more independence in economic,
trade and immigration issues. Corrada del Rio wanted Puerto Rico to
become the 51st state.
   Hernandez Colon's party consolidated a majority in the
legislature, winning 36 seats in the 51-seat House of
Representatives. The Independence Party won one seat and the
statehood New Democratic Party 14.
   Hernandez Colon was first elected in 1972. He was re-elected in
1984 and this is his second consecutive term.

<TEXT>
   The Future Farmers of America took
``farmers'' out of its name Thursday in a change designed to show
there are other agricultural careers besides working down on the
farm.
   Delegates to the national convention voted to change the name to
National FFA Organization, the culmination of a five-year movement
to broaden the organization's appeal. About 23,000 delegates are
attending the convention.
   ``The students who are already in have no concerns about the
name,'' said Bill Stagg, director of information for the
416,000-member organization.
   ``But the new students, those people have an awfully tough time
getting beyond our name. They are not interested in farming and it
was difficult for them to take on a jacket and associate themselves
with the word farmer,'' he said.
   The change was made in hopes of counteracting a 23 percent loss
of membership that has occurred since the mid-1970s.
   ``The problem we were experiencing was in the suburban and urban
areas where those kids are not preparing to be farmers,'' said
Stagg, adding that FFA's largest chapter was in Philadelphia and its
third largest was in Chicago.
   Interests of FFA members include horticulture, forestry,
agriculture mechanics, agricultural journalism, research and
marketing, Stagg said.
   The FFA is made up of high school students who develop
agricultural skills through competitions and also become active in
community projects.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Afghan rebel alliance on
Thursday criticized a U.N. diplomat who mediated the Afghanistan
accords, acusing him of bias against the Islamic insurgents and of
trying to keep them out of power.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla
coalition, also rejected any future role in government for
Afghanistan's premier, Mohammad Hassan Sharq, calling him ``a
well-known (Soviet) agent whose hands are dirty with the blood of
our people.''
   Rabbani told reporters that President-elect George Bush assured
him earlier Thursday in Washington that U.S. aid for the rebels, who
call themselves the mujahedeen, or holy warriors, ``will continue as
before.''
   He met in the afternoon with Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar at U.N. headquarters, the first time the U.N. chief has met
with any leaders of the Afghan guerrilla alliance.
   The United States has been supplying the rebels with Stinger
missiles and other military and humanitarian aid in their campaign
to drive the Soviet army out of Afghanistan. The Soviets intervened
in Afghanistan in 1979 to bolster a communist government.
   Moscow began withdrawing its more than 100,000 troops from
Afghanistan May 15 under the U.N.-mediated accords signed last April
in Geneva by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and Soviet
Union.
   Half the troops were out by Aug. 15, and the accords call for the
withdrawal to be completed by Feb. 15. A Soviet Foreign Ministry
official said last week that the rebel attacks could delay the
pullout.
   Rabbani accused the U.N. mediator, Diego Cordovez, of trying to
cut the rebels out of any future Afghan government.
   ``We believe that the United Nations is not only Cordovez,'' the
secretary-general's special representative for Afghanistan, said
Rabbani, speaking Farsi and accompanied by a translator.
   ``Unfortunately, Mr. Cordovez could not be an impartial
representative of the United Nations. He took sides, and he took
sides against the Afghan people and the mujahedeen, and this is why
he failed in his mandate,'' Rabbani said.
   He did not specify whose side he believed Cordovez supposedly had
taken.
   Cordovez, who became foreign minister of Ecuador last summer,
continues to serve as the U.N.'s special representative on
Afghanistan.
   He has been trying to persuade Afghanistan's exiled King Mohammed
Zahir Shah, who now lives in Rome, to form a government of national
reconciliation with other former Afghan politicians now in exile.
   Afghan President Najib's government has refused to relinquish
power and the rebels have sworn to continue fighting the Red Army.
   Rabbani has said the rebels will hold democratic elections among
Afghans in territory they now control, said to be more than
two-thirds of the country, and among refugees and exiles to elect a
national council.
   The council, he has said, would then adopt a constitution and
hold national elections to form a broad-based government, excluding
only senior officials of the current Communist government.
   Sharq and Najib are among those whom Rabbani said could have no
role in any future Afghan government.

Pacemaker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's first dual-chamber pacemaker to
use nuclear power was implanted in the chest of a 47-year-old man
this week, and doctors said the atomic energy source will help the
device last as long as 40 years.
   ``Theoretically, this pacemaker will last a lifetime,'' said Dr.
Victor Parsonnet, who operated on John Sniffen of Clifton on Tuesday
at Beth Israel Medical Center here.
   Pacemakers, which regulate the heartbeat, have been around for
years, but the device given to Sniffen is the first dual-chambered
design powered by plutonium. While conventional battery-powered
pacemakers must be replaced every five to eight years, Sniffen's is
expected to last from 20 to 40 years.
   Single-chamber nuclear pacemakers exist and last about 16 years,
but the two-chamber design more naturally maintains the human
heart's two-step rhythm. When the heart beats, the lower part
squeezes blood into the upper chamber, where a second squeeze then
sends the blood into the rest of the body.
   The Pulsar-N1 pacemaker, an oblong device about 2{ inches wide
and an inch thick, is placed between the skin and the muscle of the
chest wall.
   Two wires are threaded through a vein to the heart, where they
are attached to the upper and lower chambers, alternately jolting
them with electrical impulses and adapting to the patient's rate of
activity, Parsonnet explained at a news conference Thursday.
   Single-chamber pacemakers only stimulate the lower chamber, said
Parsonnet, who helped implant the first U.S.-made, single-chamber,
nuclear-powered pacemaker in 1973.
   Doctors developed a dual-chamber pacemaker in 1974, but the power
source was a lithium battery that has a lifetime of five to eight
years.
   Nuclear pacemakers, powered by plutonium 238 encased in titanium,
do not emit harmful levels of radiation, doctors said.
   ``Of the 3,000 to 4,000 put in worldwide there's never been any
evidence of the isotope plutonium doing any harm to the patient or
the environment,'' Parsonnet said.
   ``The average abdominal X-ray dose is about twice what you would
get from the nuclear pacers,'' said David L. Purdy, president of
Biocontrol Technology, the Indiana, Pa., company that manufactures
the device.
   Sniffen, who was listed in good condition, told reporters the
single-chamber, nuclear-powered pacemaker he received in 1975 gave
him ``jolts every once in a while and (I) was totally aware of it.
   ``Now I feel good. A little weak from the operation, but other
than that, it's real nice,'' he said.
   A photocopying and facsimile machine salesman, Sniffen suffers
from intermittent heart block, a condition that makes the heart stop
occasionally and can cause the patient to faint.
   Parsonnet said that with its greater longevity, the new device
can eliminate the need for replacement operations, reducing the
physical and emotional stress on the patient and saving money.
   But the new pacemaker also has its drawbacks.
   Hospitals have to be licensed to implant the nuclear devices and
patients have to be registered with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to use them.
   The dual-chamber nuclear device also costs more, about $6,000
compared to for $4,500 for its lithium counterpart. And it is also
bigger and weighs more.
   ``The major issue is the paperwork and the size,'' Purdy said.

<HEAD>First Seal to Be Cured of Virus Released into Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal welfare group on Thursday
returned to the North Sea the first seal to be cured of a virus that
has killed thousands of the mammals in northern European waters this
year.
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said
it released the 4-year-old female gray seal, nicknamed ``Godzilla,''
five miles off the eastern city of Norfolk.
   ``To everyone's great relief, Godzilla stretched out, lowered her
head and then shuffled off into the sea,'' a spokesman said. ``It
was a very moving sight because she was obviously glad to be going
back where she belonged.''
   The spokesman said Godzilla had been given seven weeks of
intensive care after being brought ashore by divers Sept. 17.
   The group's chief inspector, Mike Goodenough, said Godzilla was
named after the horror-film monster who fought King Kong because of
the ``horrendous noise she made thundering around in the pen.''
   At least 11,000 seals have died this year in northern European
waters of an epidemic Western experts believe to be caused by a
virus similar to the canine distemper virus.
   When Godzilla was first brought to veterinarians, she weighed 55
pounds and was coughing badly, said the spokesman, who requested
anonymity. After treatment to combat lungworm and other infections,
her weight more than doubled to 121 pounds and blood tests showed
she had built up antibodies against the disease, he said.
   ``This isn't just a `Bambi' story about rescuing a dear little
animal and nursing it back to health,'' he said. ``We hope that
Godzilla with her high level of antibodies will breed and strengthen
the remaining common seal population.''
   The Sea Mammal Research Unit at Cambridge north of London said
its latest figures showed between 80 and 90 percent of the
7,000-strong seal population off England's coast had died in the
epidemic.

   Jim and Tammy Bakker, along with a former
top aide, must repay $7.7 million to PTL for reaping undeserved
profits and mismanaging the TV ministry, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus
Reynolds ordered Thursday.
   Reynolds said he determined that the Bakkers and former PTL vice
president David Taggart were overpaid during their last four years
at the ministry.
   PTL, now under administration of the bankruptcy court, sued the
Bakkers and Taggart last Feb. 1 for $52 million, alleging they
grossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums for personal use
between 1984 and 1987, while PTL couldn't pay its bills.
   During the suit's trial before Reynolds in September and October,
PTL dropped its claim to all but $7.7 million. Reynolds' judgment is
the first time any court has ruled that Bakker or other PTL leaders
used PTL donors' money improperly.
   In the order signed Wednesday and filed Thursday, Reynolds said
Jim Bakker, who founded PTL and left in March 1987 after admitting
to a tryst with former church secretary Jessica Hahn, must pay PTL
$4.9 million. Tammy Bakker, his wife and former co-host of the PTL
Club television show, must repay $677,397, and Taggart must repay $1
million.
   In addition, Reynolds ordered, Bakker and Taggart jointly must
repay PTL another $1 million. Taggart was fired in April 1987 after
Bakker handed over control of PTL to the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
   Reynolds, in his 50-page explanation for the judgments, said the
expenditures at PTL under the Bakker administration were
``unbelievable'' and a ``waste of PTL's money.'' He also accused the
administrators of ``gross mismanagement'' and ``total disregard for
reality.''
   The judge rejected Bakker's attempts during the trial to justify
the $6.6 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collected
between 1984 and 1987.
   Reynolds said in his order, ``In conforming with the religious
overture of this case, this court observes that James Bakker either
overlooked or ignored parts of the Bible, including 1 Timothy 6:10
... `For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some
coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows.'''
   Reynolds said Galatians 6:7 should be applied to the PTL case:
```Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.'''
   Reynolds also said it appeared the PTL board of directors was
never informed that the ministry and Christian theme park near Fort
Mill was in ``any kind of precarious financial position.''
   Bakker and Taggart, Reynolds said, ``approached the management of
the corporation with reckless indifference to the financial
consequences of their acts.''
   ``We plan to appeal,'' said Ryan Hovis, an Rock Hill attorney
representing the Bakkers. Hovis said he could not comment on
Reynolds' order but said Bakker could not repay the ministry because
``he doesn't have anything.''
   Hovis said Bakker is ``obviously disappointed, as I think anybody
would expect him to be.''
   A secretary at the Bakkers' new organization, Jim and Tammy
Ministries in Pineville, N.C., said Jim Bakker will not comment
until he reads the order.
   Taggart's attorney, Ben Cotten of Washington, did not immediately
respond to a message left on the answering machine seeking comment.
   A federal grand jury in Charlotte has been investigating Bakker
and other former PTL officials for more than a year.
   Last month, Bakker and several former PTL associates were
notified they are targets of that investigation, which focuses on
possible mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and criminal tax violations.
   PTL attorney Brad Leggett said Thursday that although the Bakkers
and Taggart have the right to appeal Reynolds's judgment to U.S.
District Court, PTL intends to begin trying to collect.
   ``We will start procedures to locate their property, which can be
sold to pay the judgment,'' Leggett said.
   It was unclear how much money and property remains in the
Bakkers' names, as they are living in a home supporters rent for
them.

<HEAD>Osteoporosis Strikes Men, Though Not As Often As Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Osteoporosis, though most common among women, also
affects men and may be associated with alcoholism, a hormone
deficiency, or both, says a new report.
   The disease, in men and women, can lead to injuries such as hip
fractures that cause ``big public health costs, mortality and
disability,'' said Dr. C. Conrad Johnston, an endocrinologist at the
Indiana University School of Medicine.
   ``Traditionally, osteoporosis is considered a disease of women,
but it affects men too,'' said Johnston. ``It is a problem that
involves older men, and as men live longer, it will become a bigger
health problem.''
   His findings were published in Friday's issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Dr. Murray J. Favus, an endocrinologist and director of the bone
program at the University of Chicago, said research suggests that by
age 70, one-quarter of the women in North America will have
sustained a fracture related to osteoporosis.
   Probably fewer than 10 percent of the known cases of osteoporosis
are among men, though ``I'm sure there is a lot more of it out there
than we see,'' he said Thursday, adding there has not been much
research on osteoporosis in men.
   Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and may be
accompanied by increasing porosity and brittleness. Most common in
women, it can lead to spinal crush fractures that cause dowager's
hump and pain, said Johnston.
   ``Men have more bone mass than women at maturity, and they do not
have the accelerated loss associated with menopause,'' said Johnson.
``So they have two advantages _ more bone to start with and not
losing as much.''
   Favus said a lack of estrogen following menopause is the main
factor in osteoporosis in women, but with men, often ``we don't know
the cause.''
   Johnston said spinal crush fractures are six to seven times more
common in women, but hip fractures are only about twice as common in
women.
   ``The hip fracture is the one that produces the big public health
costs, mortality and disability,'' said Johnston.
   He said there seem to be more secondary causes of osteoporosis in
men, particularly alcoholism and a lack of the hormone testosterone.
Smoking also can increase the risk of osteoporosis, Johnston said.
   If secondary causes are treated or ruled out, doctors should make
sure patients have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D,
along with exercise, said Johnston.
   ``Osteoporosis is silent ... there is no clue until they fracture
something,'' said Favus. ``There needs to be more awareness (about
osteoporosis) among physicians and among men.''

   Maestro Lorin Maazel returned to his musical
roots Thursday night to direct the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra,
which he first joined in his teens as a full-time violinist and
apprentice conductor.
   Maazel made his debut as music director of the 100-member
orchestra, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Andre
Previn more than four years ago.
   It was a happy and much-heralded homecoming for Maazel, 58, who
has worked with orchestras in West Germany, England and France.
   ``I enjoy being here. I am an American and I feel my place is in
this country even though I've conducted so much abroad,'' he said
during a rehearsal break Wednesday.
   Maazel's presence on the podium Thursday night was his first
public appearance as the symphony's music director. He had been
serving since 1984 as music consultant and adviser for the symphony,
considered to be among the nation's best orchestras.
   Orchestra officials are counting on Maazel to be the symphony's
ticket to greater international recognition and renewed financial
success. The symphony has a projected 1987-88 loss of $1.5 million,
its largest ever.
   Officials say the orchestra's financial problems stem from fewer
anticipated grants, rising operating costs and the opening of the
Benedum Center for the Performing Arts. The new hall lured away the
local opera and ballet companies, resulting in lost rentals.
   Managing Director Gideon Toeplitz said a $3 million grant from
the Vira I. Heinz Endowment helps make Maazel one of the highest
paid conductors in the nation. He declined to provide specifics.
   ``I can guarantee to you if we would have paid less to somebody,
the quality would have gone by ... much faster than the money
would,'' Toeplitz said.
   Maazel said his first priority is to make the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra more visible worldwide.
   ``It's a question of presentation and projection,'' he said.
``Now, because of my appointment, people are thinking about
Pittsburgh and discovering the values that they've had all along.''
   He said classical music is on an upswing in America.
   ``We're rediscovering values like the family, homegrown apples
and with it, I think, will come a heightened awareness of classical
music,'' he said.
   Maazel's formal, high-brow style contrasts sharply with that of
Previn, who shocked local audiences when he suddently shed his
tuxedo for a black vest and open white shirt near the end of his
reign in Pittsburgh.
   Maazel, born in Paris to American parents, moved to Pittsburgh as
a youth to study violin under Vladimir Bakaleinikoff. He attended
Pittsburgh's Peabody High School and the University of Pittsburgh,
where he studied literature and philosophy.
   Maazel's mother, Marie, recently retired as head of a local youth
orchestra.
   In 1984, Maazel had resigned amid controversy as director of the
Vienna State Opera, a post he held for nearly two years following 10
years with the Cleveland Orchestra.
   Maazel accepted the job of Pittsburgh's music director in late
1986. His contract runs through the 1991-92 season.
   Toeplitz said Maazel's arrival in Pittsburgh this week had an
immediate impact.
   ``He walked on stage (Wednesday) and within a few second, it was
like a miracle. It became a first-rate ensemble,'' Toeplitz said.
``I've been around conductors all my life and I don't remember
seeing that kind of thing happen.''

   With a funeral director reading the vote
tallies, thousands gathered Thursday for a 196-year-old tradition of
bringing Delaware's winners and losers of the general election
together to literally bury the hatchet.
   An estimated 27,000 people _ including dozens of politicians _
showed up for Return Day.
   ``This is America. The majority has spoken. It's a great day and
woe be to those persons who aren't here,'' former Sussex County
administrator Joseph Conaway said of the politicians who lost their
elections and weren't in attendance.
   Return Day has been held here since Georgetown, a community of
about 2,000 people, was made the Sussex County seat in 1792.
   The celebration always takes place the Thursday after the general
election, with the focus on a parade where winners and losers ride
together in horse-drawn carriages or other modes of transportation
to put campaign differences aside.
   Funeral director Ronald Dodd read the county's election returns
from the balcony of the county courthouse, dressed in a black silk
top hat and tails and white gloves.
   Once the returns are read, tradition calls for party leaders to
do the hatchet burying.
   Conaway laid a hatchet in a box, and Republican Party Chairman
Basil Battaglia and Democratic Party Chairman Samuel Shipley stepped
forward and together emptied a bucket full of sand over it. The
crowd cheered.
   ``It's not easy. You have to be on both sides to really
appreciate it,'' said Conaway, who has served as Return Day master
of ceremonies since 1976.
   Conaway has been both a winner and loser. A Democrat, he enjoyed
a long tenure as Sussex County's administrator until Republicans
took control of the county commissioners in 1986.
   David Levinson, re-elected state insurance commissioner, has also
participated as a loser. Six years ago, he lost a U.S. Senate race.
   ``When I came as a loser it was no fun. It was a strain,'' he
said Thursday. ``This time I have a 30-point win and it makes it a
lot easier.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Says Prosecutor Mischaracterized North Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf pvs, bgng: ``Walsh's brief ...'' to restore
dropped word `didn't'.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department set off a confrontation
Thursday with the Iran-Contra prosecutor by telling a judge that a
prosecution brief filed in Oliver L. North's case ``mischaracterizes
basic constitutional principles.''
   In an unusual move, the department sought court permission to
file a brief in North's case to ``articulate, clearly and
definitively the executive's view'' of the relationship between the
president and the Congress.
   The department said a brief filed last month by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh ``contains numerous statements that are
inconsistent with previously articulated statements of the law by
the Department of Justice and other Executive Branch agencies and
departments.''
   Walsh's brief in support of charges that North and three
co-defendants conspired to defraud the government by diverting
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contras
``mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of separation of
powers and executive branch authority,'' the Justice Department said.
   The filing was made by Assistant Attorneys General Edward S.G.
Dennis Jr., head of the criminal division, and Douglas W. Kmiec, of
the office of legal counsel.
   Department officials refused to specify the legal disagreements
with Walsh.
   But the filing referred to a pleading in which Walsh discussed
the workings of the Boland Amendment, a series of restrictions on
military aid to the Contras that were enacted by Congress.
   Walsh's brief disputed North's position that the Boland Amendment
didn't apply to the National Security Council, where the former
presidential aide had worked before he was fired two years ago.
   A 1985 memo by Bretton Sciaroni, the counsel to President
Reagan's Intelligence Oversight Board, said the Boland Amendment did
not apply to the NSC staff.
   The Justice Department said it needs until Nov. 25 to file its
legal views, saying Walsh ``effectively precluded the Department of
Justice from advising the IC (independent counsel), prior to the
filing of its memorandum, of the department's views with respect to
separation of powers and executive authority.''
   The filing drew a tart response from Walsh's office, which issued
a statement saying: ``The independent counsel rejects the suggestion
that it should have solicited the views of the Department of Justice
or that it has mischaracterized the law.
   ``While the independent counsel does not object to the submission
of legal views by the department, it strenuously opposes this wholly
unjustified 11th-hour motion for an extension of time,'' the
statement said.
   The Justice Department said it ``does not seek to support either
the motions filed by the defendant'' or Walsh's ``efforts to defeat
those motions.''
   ``Accordingly, the department does not intend to argue for or
against dismissal of Count One of the indictment.''
   The department said it decided Wednesday to make the filing after
consulting the White House, the National Security Council, the State
and Defense departments and the CIA.
   The filing came hours after Gesell had rebuked North in an
opinion, saying his argument to dismiss charges he lied ``reveals a
skewed attitude toward our form of constitutional government.''
   Gesell had denied defense motions to dismiss charges that the
former National Security Council aide obstructed Reagan's November
1986 inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair by destroying documents and
lying to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   North ``fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct,''
Gesell wrote in a scathing opinion that denounced the retired Marine
lieutenant colonel's contention that no laws were broken when he
lied to Meese and destroyed documents.
   The judge rejected defense arguments that North cannot be
prosecuted for lying to Meese because the attorney general's
questioning was not part of a ``pending proceeding'' before a
government agency.
   North is charged with lying when, among other things, he denied
to Meese any National Security Council involvement in diverting
arms-sale proceeds to the Contras.
   Gesell dismissed North's contention ``that he had an absolute
right to lie, to obstruct such inquiries, and to remove or destroy
official NSC records because he had not been warned that if he did
so he might be indicted.''
   ``There is nothing in the Constitution, federal statutes, or
applicable decisions which warrants this cynical approach,'' he said.
   The judge also rejected North's suggestion that he cannot be
prosecuted ``because he was not put on notice that criminal statutes
long in effect would be applied to him if he acted corruptly as
alleged.''
   Walsh ``will need only to prove at trial that the specific
questions posed to North by the attorney general were precise and
material to this legitimate presidential inquiry'' and that North
purposely lied, the judge said.
   North is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   No date has been set for any of the four trials ordered by Gesell
for each defendant.

   Rockwell International will

announced Friday.
   The consolidation will add 400 to 450 jobs at the Kennedy Space
Center, with about 100 to 125 of those transferring from other
Rockwell divisions. The greatest number will come from the company's
facility at Downey, Calif. There are about 200 Rockwell launch
support workers here.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the
contract will consolidate Rockwell's space shuttle logistics
operation in California with its launch support operations here.
Some engineering design support and manufacturing tasks will
continue at Downey, where a space shuttle is being built to replace
Challenger, destroyed in a 1986 explosion.
   The contract, signed with Rocwell's Space Transportations Systems
Division, covers a three-year period starting last Oct. 1. It does
not represent any new work but is an extension and consolidation of
existing functions managed by the Kennedy Space Center, officials
said.
   The work involves repair of shuttle orbiter and ground support
equipment hardware and purchase of support equipment spares.

<TEXT>
   The president of parliament called the
early years of the Hitler era a ``glorious'' time for many Germans,
triggering a walkout during the government's ceremony Thursday
marking the Kristallnacht.
   The remarks by Philipp Jenniger threatened to overshadow West
Germany's carefully planned ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary
of the Kristallnacht, the night the Nazis began their first
organized assault against the Jews.
   But a leader of West Germany's Jewish community, Michael Fuerst,
defended Jenninger's speech, saying it was simply describing the
situation in Germany during those years. Fuerst said he did not
understand the calls for Jenninger to resign.
   ``I welcome that the parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,''
Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in West
Germany, said in a television interview.
   ``Especially the fact that everything that Hitler did was
strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' he added.
   Jenninger's remarks prompted demands for his resignation by
members of the opposition Greens and Social Democrats, who were
among about 50 who marched out of the hall during the nationally
televised speech to parliament.
   The national ARD and ZDF television networks both reported late
Thursday that Jenninger was expected to resign shortly.
   The Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt, which is close to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative government, said Jenninger was expected
to announce his resignation Friday.
   In its early Friday edition, Die Welt said Kohl strongly
criticized Jenninger at a private meeting Thursday, but left it to
Jenninger whether to resign.
   Social Democrat chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel said in a letter to
Jenninger, a conservative, that the parliament president had shown a
``disturbing lack of judgment'' in his speech.
   In his speech, the 56-year-old Jenninger had talked at length
about the positive feelings of many ordinary Germans early in the
Hitler dictatorship.
   ``Didn't Hitler bring to reality what (Kaiser) Wilhelm II had
only promised, that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Wasn't
he chosen by Providence, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people only
once in a thousand years?'' Jenninger asked.
   ``For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler's
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and
misdeeds,'' Jenninger said. ``The years from 1933 to 1938, even from
a distant retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed, still
are a fascinating thing today, since throughout history there was
hardly a parallel to Hitler's triumphal procession during the first
years.''
   Jenninger then cited such events as inclusion of the Saarland,
Austria, and part of Czechoslovakia into the Third Reich, as well as
the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.
   But some listeners also had sobbed when Jenninger read an
eyewitness account of the murder of concentration camp victims in
1942.
   ``Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' he
read. ``Some of those shot were still moving, some lifted their arms
and turned their heads, to show they were still alive.''
   In Jerusalem, Israel's Foreign Ministry said it was astonished by
Jenninger's speech.
   ``We have known Dr. Jenninger for years as the man who headed
many friendly delegations to Israel,'' it said in a statement.
   ``The way of interpreting the Nazi era and the description of its
historical background in his speech are unacceptable for any Jew,''
it said. ``It was a miserable speech, whatever the original
intentions may be.''
   Edgar Bronfman, president of the New York-based World Jewish
Congress, said in a statement that Jenninger's remarks were
``reprehensible'' and demanded an urgent explanation.
   Later Thursday, a Greens lawmaker said Jenninger's speech showed
that ``anti-Semitism exists in the hearts of many members of this
house.''
   The statement by Jutta Oesterle-Schwerin brought loud jeers from
other lawmakers and parliament vice-president Annemarie Renger
several times tried to interrupt Mrs. Oesterle-Schwerin's speech,
finally shutting off the microphone.
   Starting with the Kristallnacht of Nov. 9-10, 1938, the Nazis
made clear their intentions to wipe out European Jews. On that
night, Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues,
sending 30,000 Jews to concentration camps and killing 91 Jews.
   Shattered glass covered the streets and the Nazis, in a boastful
mood, named it Kristallnacht, which in English is Crystal Night.
   The Nazis killed 6 million Jews and many others during Hitler's
rule from 1933 to 1945.
   Before Jenninger spoke at the government's ceremonies, an
88-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor Ida Ehre read from Paul
Celan's poem ``Todesfuge,'' one of the most dramatic poems about the
Holocaust.
   ``Death is a master from Germany, his eye is blue,'' Ms. Ehre, an
actress and director in Hamburg, read. ``He strikes thee with leaden
bullets, he strikes thee exactly.''
   In Communist East Berlin, thousands of people gathered at one of
Europe's largest synagogues for ceremonies marking the start of its
restoration, timed to coincide with the Kristallnacht rememberances.

   A group of business executives plans to visit
Jamaica next week to survey prospects for private investment aimed
at speeding the Caribbean island's economic recovery from the
ravages of Hurricane Gilbert, a government official said Thursday.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a self-sustaining U.S.
government agency supporting private investment in Third World
countries, is sponsoring the mission to identify specific projects,
said OPIC President Craig A. Nalen.
   OPIC has earmarked $10 million dollars for direct loans and
guarantees and $100 million in insurance coverage for investors
wanting to rebuild storm-damaged facilities and other eligible
projects, Nalen said.
   Total damage in Jamaica from the mid-September hurricane has been
estimated at from $800 million to $1 billion.

   George Bush met Thursday with the
leaders of his presidential transition team and with President
Reagan and the Cabinet before traveling to Florida for a four-day
vacation.
   As his presidential campaign headquarters in Washington was being
dismantled, the president-elect huddled with his chief of staff,
Craig Fuller, and campaign adviser Robert Teeter, the two people he
named to head the transition effort following his election victory.
   He also attended Reagan's morning meeting with White House chief
of staff Kenneth Duberstein and the president's daily briefing with
National Security Adviser Colin Powell.
   The president-elect and his wife, Barbara, arrived late Thursday
in West Palm Beach, Fla., where they were met by Gov. Bob Martinez.
The couple later traveled to the Gulf Stream home of close friend
William Stamps Farish III, a 49-year-old multimillionaire who like
Bush made his money in the oil business.
   Upon arriving, Bush declined to engage in a conversation with
reporters, but when one journalist shouted, ``How's the transition
going?'' the president-elect smiled and said, ``Couldn't be going
better.''
   Mrs. Bush chatted briefly with reporters aboard Air Force Two,
where she related a story about the tightened security for the
president-elect and his family.
   She said that she wanted to talk a walk in a Houston park the
other day and the park was closed to the public, allowing her to
walk alone. ``I'll never walk in a public park again,'' she said.
   Bush did not take advisers or staff members with him on what his
aides insisted was primarily a vacation.
   Bush planned to fish and relax in Delray, Fla. He told reporters
he also intended to spend time on the telephone as he contemplates
his new administration.
   At the afternoon Cabinet meeting, the president and Bush walked
in together and were applauded by the assembled members, said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We don't even argue over which side of the table to sit on,''
Reagan quipped as he and Bush took their usual positions opposite
one another across the table.
   Fitzwater said Duberstein had asked all presidential appointees
to submit their resignations to smooth the way for Bush to name his
own choices when he takes office. Bush has already named his
secretary of state, longtime friend and adviser James A. Baker III.
   The president indicated he wanted the transition as smooth and
cooperative as possible, said Fitzwater.
   And he urged the cabinet to be cooperative and be prepared to
stay past Jan. 20 if needed while Bush completes the transition.
   ``He told us yesterday he is not going to try to step into Ronald
Reagan's shoes until after Jan. 20,'' which is inauguration day,
press secretary Steve Hart said.
   He said Bush also met in his Executive Office Building office
with a group of rebels from Afghanistan.
   ``This was an opportunity for him to do what he has traditionally
done, which is meet with foreign leaders and foreign
representatives,'' Hart said.
   Bush told the chairman of the Afghan Alliance, Burhannudin
Rabbani, that he would support their efforts toward total withdrawal
of Soviet troops and and self-determination, but did not pledge any
specific monetary or other support, according to Hart.

   Fire touched off a chemical explosion at a
printing plant Thursday, sending 17 people to hospitals with burns,
cuts and bruises and forcing an evacuation at the state's largest
newspaper.
   The injured included 15 firefighters who were blown through the
air by an explosion as they used water and chemicals to fight the
second of two fires at the plant, said city fire Capt. Keith
Milliner. He said none of the firefighters' injuries were believed
to be serious.
   Two pressmen at the Standard Gravure plant were taken to
hospitals for treatment of second-degree burns on their arms and
faces, officials said.
   Production of The Courier-Journal was disrupted by the evacuation
of that newspaper's building, which is adjacent to the printing
plant and also houses the main office for Kentucky of The Associated
Press. Workers were allowed back into the building at 10 p.m., but
power was not fully restored immediately.
   George Gill, president and publisher of The Courier-Journal, said
his staff was ``going to go back to the old-fashioned way'' to put
out Friday's editions.
   Courier-Journal staffers set up with typewriters and telephones
in an old company-owned building across the street.
   Gill said editors planned to dictate their copy to the Lexington
Herald-Leader, 80 miles away, and Friday's editions would be printed
there. The two newspapers are statewide competitors, but have an
agreement to help each other through such emergencies.
   Naphtha, a volatile chemical used to thin ink in printing, was
believed responsible for the explosion, said Art Smithers, night
supervisor at the plant, which prints magazines and color
advertising materials.
   Smithers said the first fire broke out about 6 p.m. in one of the
presses, injuring the two pressmen. A co-worker, press operator
Walter Emert, identified them as Jim Sitzler and Jim Lucas.
   Workers around them ``did what they were supposed to do. We ran
like hell,'' said Emert, 52.
   A chemical fire exinguisher came on automatically, he said.
   Workers were cleaning up from the first fire when the second
flared, apparently ignited by embers contacting newsprint and ink on
the floor, Smithers said.
   Firefighters had entered with chemicals and hoses to put out the
ink-related fire when naphtha on the floor and in the air ignited
without warning, Smithers said.
   Milliner said the force of the blast lifted firefighters off
their feet, knocking some into walls and through doors.
   The explosion, which occurred about 1{ hours after the first
fire, also left a gaping, two-story hole in the rear wall of the
six-story Standard Gravure building.
   Injured firefighters staggered from the building, coughing and
gasping, and some appeared dazed. They were given oxygen masks, put
on stretchers and taken away in ambulances.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Ban on Inmate Writing for Newspaper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Thursday ordered federal prison
officials to allow inmates to write bylined newspaper articles for
pay, and to stop retaliating against a prisoner who wrote an article
criticizing a warden.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Legge said he was persuaded that the
inmate whose transfer started the case, Dannie Martin, posed ``no
threat to safety or order within the institution'' by his writing,
and was being punished only for the content of his articles in the
San Francisco Chronicle.
   Legge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting the
Bureau of Prisons from enforcing seldom-used rules that forbid
federal prisoners from receiving pay or using bylines when writing
for newspapers and other outside publications.
   He said officials had allowed many prisoners to write articles or
books for pay and had failed to show that enforcement of the ban,
against Martin or anyone else, would promote safety or any other
valid concern in running the prisons.
   He also said a rule that prohibits inmates from running
businesses in prison cannot be enforced against writers. The
injunction is binding until Martin's suit goes to trial.
   Since the case arose, Martin has been transferred from a
California federal prison to a prison near Phoenix.
   The Chronicle asked Legge to return Martin to California, where
his observations would have more value for the newspaper's readers;
the judge said he was uncertain about security and space
considerations, and asked the lawyers to consult one another.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Sandra Willis said she was surprised by
the ruling, and particularly by Legge's refusal to rule out damage
awards against prison officials involved in Martin's case. She said
no decision has been made on an appeal.
   Martin, 48, began serving a 33-year sentence for bank robbery in
1981. He started sending articles to the Chronicle about two years
ago on his observations about prison life and conditions at the
federal prison in Lompoc, Calif., where he then was confined.
   This June, he was placed in solitary confinement three days after
the Chronicle ran his article criticizing Lompoc's new warden, R.H.
Rison. Martin then was transferred twice in the next two weeks.
   His suit, joined by the Chronicle, contended that Martin was
being treated unfairly and that the regulations prohibiting bylined
and paid articles by prisoners violated constitutional freedom of
expression.
   Willis, the government's lawyer, declared, ``This is not a
censorship case,'' and argued that the ban on bylined and paid
outside articles was justified by security considerations.
   ``The money that Mr. Martin was trying to earn caused him to look
for and say things he might not otherwise have said,'' such as
interviewing other prisoners, Willis said. ``You can't control an
inmate who has his own money.''
   But Legge said other prisoners had been allowed to earn money,
and that there was substantial evidence that the actions against
Martin were based on the content of his writings.

<HEAD>Parkinson's Patient Receives Fetal Cell Implant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors announced Thursday they have implanted
fetal tissue into the brain of a patient with Parkinson's disease in
experimental surgery aimed at curtailing the disease's symptoms.
   The doctors who performed the surgery at the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center said they believed the operation was
the first of its kind in the United States.
   Curt Freed, who headed the surgery team, said the operation has
been performed on a few Parkinson's patients in Mexico and Sweden,
but he added the results have been far from satisfactory.
   Freed said the eight-hour surgery Wednesday was on a 52-year-old
Denver man who has had Parkinson's for 20 years.
   Parkinson's disease results from the loss of brain cells that
produce a substance called dopamine. Symptoms include tremors, slow
movement, rigidity in the limbs and stooped posture.
   Freed, a professor of medicine and pharmacology, said his
experiments on monkeys indicate that fetal tissue implanted in the
adult brain can begin producing dopamine and possibly curtail
Parkinson's symptoms.
   He said the fetal cells ``are exactly like seeds,'' which could
take up to six months to grow, spread and ``re-energize the brain.''
   The controversial fetal-cell implants have been used in recent
years in an effort to help diabetics and, most notably, radiation
victims of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl in the
Soviet Union, Freed said.
   Some abortion opponents have claimed fetal-cell implants could
encourage more women to have abortions.
   Freed said many researchers in the U.S. ``are primed'' to use
fetal-cell implants on Parkinson's patients, but he believes his
experiment was the first.
   CU neurosurgeon Robert Breeze, who actually transplanted the
cells Wednesday, said they were implanted with needles through a
hole in the top of the skull to the area deep in the brain where
dopamine acts.
   The patient, who has asked not to be identified, was conscious
throughout the operation and was recovering well Thursday, Breeze
said.
   ``We're happy to see that the patient tolerated the procedure so
well, and now it's a waiting period,'' said Freed at a news
conference.
   The two milligrams of tissue used Wednesday were obtained after
an abortion performed by a physician who wasn't involved in the
research, the doctors said.
   The CU researchers stressed that the woman gave her consent to
the use of the tissue, and she wasn't paid for it.
   Freed said his scientific research shouldn't be confused with the
political issue of abortion.
   ``We'd like to separate the case of fetal tissue from the act of
abortion, which is clearly a political issue,'' he said. ``Given the
abortion's happened ... can we throw this stuff away?
   ``Fetal cells have much more flexibility _ they will grow under
conditions where adult cells won't grow,'' he said.
   The tissue must come from a fetus aged 6 weeks to 9 weeks.
   The surgery was approved by the center's Human Subjects
Committee, and was funded through private donations. Freed said he
estimated the operation would end up costing about $10,000.
   The standard treatment for Parkinson's disease has been a drug
called L-dopa, which has proven effective in the early stages of the
disease but becomes less effective as Parkinsonism becomes more
severe.
   Freed said the patient has been unable to work for several years,
despite heavy doses of drugs every 2{ hours.
   Freed was cautious about predicting how much the man's condition
could improve as a result of the surgery.
   ``We expect general mobility would improve and hopefully a
reduction in drug needs,'' he said.
   Freed said the CU team intends to perform more fetal-cell
implants on Parkinson's patients in the future.

   A group of business executives plans to visit
Jamaica next week to survey prospects for private investment aimed
at speeding the Caribbean island's economic recovery from the
ravages of Hurricane Gilbert, a government official said Thursday.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a self-sustaining U.S.
government agency supporting private investment in Third World
countries, is sponsoring the mission to identify specific projects,
said OPIC President Craig A. Nalen.
   OPIC has earmarked $10 million dollars for direct loans and
guarantees and $100 million in insurance coverage for investors
wanting to rebuild storm-damaged facilities and other eligible
projects, Nalen said.
   Total damage in Jamaica from the mid-September hurricane has been
estimated at from $800 million to $1 billion.

<HEAD>Church Of England Boost For Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Church of England on Thursday voted
to set a quota of 24 black representatives on their 574-member
General Synod, which now has only eight blacks.
   With little more than half its members present, the synod debated
for 2{ hours, then voted 214-74 with 11 abstentions for the quota.
   The Archbishop of York, the Most Rev. John Habgood, said the
change would encourage blacks to run for election to the synod in
their church parishes.
   ``We need to increase their representation in the church as a
whole because black people in our midst have a great contribution to
make,'' Habgood said.
   The vote followed a report from the church's Committee for Black
Anglican Concerns proposing the change for the next synod elections
in 1990.
   The church's first black bishop to serve in England,
Barbados-born Bishop of Croydon Wilfred Wood, who chairs the
committee, said after the vote: ``I'm gratified by it ... I hope
black people will come forward and take their places in the Church
of England.''
   Synod candidates for election in 1990 will have to complete an
ethnic monitoring questionnaire. If the number of blacks elected
falls below 24, the quota will be made up from unsuccessful black
candidates with the highest votes.
   John Gummer, the Conservative government's local government
minister and a leading member of the synod, opposed the motion which
he called ``apartheid in reverse.''
   Gummer said the problem was that not enough blacks ran for the
synod and the church should do more by asking blacks to be
candidates.
   There are no statistics on how many blacks there are in the
Church of England, which has about 1 million regular Sunday
worshipers and has been in slow decline for most of this century.
   Wood's committee estimates England's black community may be
almost 7 percent of the 49 million population.

   Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet
dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award
Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
   Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the International
League for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder,
the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
   The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip to
the West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
freed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky. The human rights
activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
   About 200 guests, including author Elie Wiesel, Brooklyn District
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, designer Caroline Roehm and ABC
television's Barbara Walters, attended the reception.
   The ceremony was closed to the media. Sakharov, wearing a blue
beret and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the reception
and entered a waiting limousine.
   Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which has its
headquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groups
around the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, which
Sakharov and his colleagues founded in 1971.
   Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visit
relatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washington
for a White House visit and a board meeting of the International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he
is a director.

<HEAD>LBJ Son-In-Law Makes Democrats Electable in Virginia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For three years, Charles S. Robb was out of
the spotlight that had become so familiar, first as the son-in-law
of President Lyndon Johnson and then as Democratic governor of this
conservative state.
   But on Tuesday, the 49-year-old lawyer re-entered the national
arena in decisive style, fashioning a huge victory over Republican
long-shot Maurice Dawkins, a retired black minister and Washington
lobbyist.
   Robb said today he won because ``we attempted to identify with
mainstream values that are crucial to success at the national
level,'' such as strong defense and fiscal responsibility.
   With 99 percent of the precincts counted, Robb had 1,448,389
votes or 71 percent, to Dawkins' 587,887 votes or 29 percent.
   The former Marine combat officer has built a career by making
Democrats electable in conservative Virginia.
   Once known only as the former White House military social aide
who married LBJ's daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson, he won the
lieutenant governor's race in 1977 in his first bid for elective
office.
   Four years later, he ran for governor in the first sweep by
Democrats of the state's top three offices since 1965.
   Robb was a popular governor who was credited with overhauling the
state bureaucracy and making major gains in education funding. He
also opened positions of authority in state government to blacks and
women and appointed Virginia's first black Supreme Court member.
   The former governor was also one of the architects of last
spring's Super Tuesday presidential primary, intended in part to
give the Southern vote collective strength.
   But Robb's tenure was shaken by prison troubles that drew
national attention when six death row inmates escaped in May 1984.
   Robb, who could not succeed himself under Virginia's
constitution, had been out of office for three years and practicing
law until his bid for the Senate.
   ``I've been unemployed for a long time, and it looks like I just
got a job,'' he said.

   Here is the text of remarks given as President
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, welcomed President-elect George Bush and
his wife, Barbara, and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, to the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday.
   
   Reagan: Thank you. George and Dan and Bar and Marilyn, it's
wonderful to have you here. And if anyone wants to know how Nancy
and I feel about this moment, just read our smiles.
   Actually though, I have some figures here that I thought you and
the rest of the country might be interested in. According to my
calculations, it's only 1188 days to the Iowa caucus.
   Now, I think the country has heard quite enough political
speech-making from all of us in the past few months, so I just want
to make one or two simple but heart-felt points. First, I want you
to know, Mr. President-elect and Mr. Vice President-elect, how proud
I am of both of you, of the extraordinary perseverence and character
and grit that you've shown in this difficult year.
   And I think, too, your worthy opponents would agree what a
challenge to human endurance a presidential campaign has become. So
I want to congratulate both of you, as well as Governor Dukakis and
Senator Bentsen, in taking on the great challenge, and your sense of
public duty in seeing it through to the end. Each of you is better
for it and so is the country.
   Now, in this hard-fought campaign, George and Dan, I also want to
compliment you for going to the people on the issues and asking for
a mandate on critical matters like the taxing and spending power,
the nature of judicial appointments, the strength of our defenses,
and the firmness of our foreign policy. I think that mandate has
been unmistakably delivered, and I know in carrying it out, you will
be true to your promises and faithful to the people's wishes.
   With George Bush and Dan Quayle, I feel our achievements are
secure, our change now a permanent feature of American government.
But I also believe your mandate will make it possible not just to
continue, but to build upon the achievements of the past eight
years. This is not the end of an era, but a time to refresh and
strengthen our new beginning. In fact, to those who sometimes
flatter me with talk of a Reagan revolution, today my hope is this:
``You ain't seen nothing yet.''
   And finally, let me say that, despite the long months of
campaigning, the seemingly endless controversy and the sheer human
exhaustion of it all, choosing our leaders is, after all, a decision
critical to our own future, to the future of this much-loved nation,
and to the cause of human freedom. And that's why today, Americans
of every political persuasion and background can come together as
one.
   Even as we accept the verdict of the majority and pledge to
protect always the rights of the minority, we put behind us the
divisions and controversies of the immediate past and begin anew. So
it's a day for congratulations, yes. But it's also a day for
remembering that whatever may temporarily divide us is far
outweighed by that which unites us.
   America has much to be proud of today. Pledges of a new president
and a new vice president, and pledges of support from the loyal
opposition, Republican, Democrat, Independent. Today, we're one
nation, one people, and our national treasure, our national mission,
the cause of human freedom continues to prosper and light the world.
   Thank you. God bless you.
   
   Bush: Thank you, Mr. President. And all I will say, just in the
shadow of the office that you have enobled, we are very, very
grateful to you. I don't believe there is a case in modern
presidential politics where a president has worked so hard to help
someone else achieve this office. And I will always be grateful.
   I can hardly believe it. But it's sinking in now, the enormity of
what has taken place, a peaceful election, eventually a peaceful
transfer of power.
   And I just think for all the Bush family, and I expect I speak
for Marilyn and Dan on this one, and we are grateful to you and to
Nancy for going that extra mile.
   And I can _ I really believe that the results would have been
entirely different if we hadn't had this loyal, steadfast campaign
support _ and I know they would _ if I hadn't learned from a giant
the good things about the United States of America.
   Thank you, sir.
   Dan.
   
   Quayle: Well, Mr. President, as one who came to the Senate in
1980, thank you for all that you have done for America.
   And now, Mr. President-elect, yesterday, the American people
overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your
leadership.
   And I am delighted to be a part of that team; ready to go to work
and to continue to change America and make it even greater.
   Thank you both very, very much.

   Michael Dukakis had carried Hawaii and some
residents of the 50th state were still voting when Republican George
Bush was declared winner of the presidential election.
   With 96 percent of the vote tallied, the Democrat from
Massachusetts had 173,363 votes, or 55 percent, to Bush's 142,200
votes, or 45 percent, to win the state's four electoral votes.
   Only two Republicans _ Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in
1984 _ have carried Hawaii in a presidential race.
   Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga won re-election easily over
Republican Maria Hustace and Libertarian Kenneth Schoolland.
Matsunaga polled 247,941 votes or 76 percent to Hustace's 66,987 or

   Freshman Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki turned back a strong
challenge from Democrat Mary Bitterman, a former Voice of America
director, and Rep. Daniel Akaka, a Democrat, won an easy re-election
victory.
   Oahu voters overwhelmingly approved an intitiative proposal to
withdraw residential zoning from a strip of land across from Sandy
Beach, a popular surfing area at the east end of Oahu.
   However, voters on Hawaii Island rejected an initiative to
downzone a parcel of land where a Japanese-owned company plans to
build a resort hotel on one of the island's most popular beaches.

   Veteran astronaut Karol J. Bobko is retiring
from NASA and from the Air Force on Jan. 1, the space agency
announced Wednesday.
   Bobko, 51, made three flights aboard the space shuttle, including
two as mission commander.
   He was selected as an astronaut in August 1969, and participated
in ground support work for the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz space flight
projects.
   Bobko is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and holds the rank
of colonel in the Air Force.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that
Bobko was leaving government service to join the firm of Booz, Allen
& Hamilton Inc., a space contractor with offices near the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.

   A reputed mob figure in the
Philadelphia-southern New Jersey area was convicted Wednesday of
running a ``criminal enterprise,'' loan sharking, dealing in cocaine
and importing a chemical used to make the drug ``speed.''
   A federal jury found Albert ``Reds'' Pontani of Trenton guilty of
10 counts in a 12-count indictment. Four associates also were
convicted on various loan-harking, drug and illegal phone use counts.
   Authorities said the case struck a blow to the organization of
alleged crime boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo, who is on trial
on racketeering charges in federal court in Philadelphia.
   Pontani, 61, faces up to life in prison.
   The jury, which deliberated nearly three days, also convicted
Daniel Marino, 58, of Cherry Hill; Angelo ``Cappy'' Belardo, 59, of
Trenton; Daniel Muccie, 58, of Trenton; and former Camden police
officer James Wilson, in his mid-40s, of Camden.
   All face lengthy prison terms at their Jan. 3 sentencing before
U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry.
   The government relied on secretly taped conversations involving
the defendants, and the testimony of admitted or jailed drug-dealers
who served as paid government informants.
   Pontani's attorney, Donald Manno, said he would appeal the
conviction.
   ``It's a sorry day when the government can decide in advance
who's good and bad and set out to find a crime, by paying people, by
giving immunity'' and other considerations ``none of which the
defense could even think of doing with a witness,'' he said.
   ``It's an even sorrier day when the jury believes those kind of
people.''
   He would not comment on the government's allegations about
Pontani's organized crime ties, which were not included in the
indictment.

   Maoist guerrillas killed two soldiers, a
police chief and a farmer in two attacks Wednesday, police said.
   In Peru's eastern jungle, dozens of guerrillas from the Maoist
Shining Path ambushed an army patrol, killing the two soldiers and
wounding two others, police said. The soldiers were patrolling on
foot near Huayranga, a settlement in Peru's Amazon jungle 270 miles
northeast of Huancayo, which is 130 miles east of Lima.
   Four soldiers were listed as missing after a brief clash that
followed the ambush, police said. It was not immediately known how
many soldiers were in the patrol and whether the guerrillas suffered
any casualties.
   The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to impose Marxist
rule in Peru. The insurgency erupted in the south central Andes but
has since spread to coastal urban centers and into the sparsely
populated eastern jungle.
   More than 12,000 people, mainly highland peasants, have died in
the violence, according to the government.
   Also Wednesday in the Andean highlands, a column of Shining Path
guerrillas dragged a village police chief and a farmer from their
homes before dawn and shot and killed them in the town square,
police said.
   The men were slain for being members of the ruling center-left
Aprista Party, the police said. The incident occured in San Jose de
Quilulla, a hamlet on the outskirts of Huancayo.

<HEAD>Houston Livestock Show To Test Students' Animals For Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students who enter livestock at a show next year
may have their animals tested for drugs such as steroids, organizers
said.
   Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the Houston Livestock
Show, said organizers wanted to assure ``the group of Houstonians
who support our youngsters and buy meat at our shows'' that the meat
is free of any drug residue.
   He said the show, which attracts members of 4-H and Future
Farmers of America, also wants to ``teach youngsters the
responsibility of how to raise meat for the market under federal
laws.''
   The program will affect those students who show steers, pigs,
poultry and lambs that are slaughtered afterward for food. It will
not apply to professional ranchers and breeders who show animals
used strictly for breeding, Shafer said.
   ``No doubt this will be the pioneer,'' said Don Goodman,
president of the Greater Houston Large Animal Veterinarian
Practitioners Association. ``In my opinion, if it goes off well and
people stand behind it, a lot of major shows will follow.''
   Blood or urine samples could be taken at any time during the
show, Shafer said. Animals testing positive for drugs would be
disqualified. Prizes and money from animal sales will be held until
drug tests are completed.
   ``It is safe to assume that any animal who wins will be tested,''
he said, adding that other animals will be tested at random.
   Surveys at previous livestock shows in Texas indicated that some
animals had been given anabolic steroids, tranquilizers and
diuretics. Steroids help add bulk to animals.

<HEAD>Star-Banner Declared MacKay Winner of Senate Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some editions of Wednesday's Ocala Star-Banner
declared Democrat Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay the winner in his race
against Republican Connie Mack for the U.S. Senate.
   ``Hey Buddy, you're a senator,'' read the headline on 5,000
copies of MacKay's hometown paper. The headline parodied a
television ad used by Mack to put down MacKay as a liberal.
   The only problem is uncounted absentee ballots will decide the
race.
   Editors decided to use the headline at 2:15 a.m. Wednesday when
MacKay was ahead by 10,000 votes, said Executive Editor Mark Mathes.
   MacKay made the most of the attention, holding up a copy of the
newspaper at a news conference in Ocala.
   ``I've been instructed in visual ads in this campaign,'' MacKay
joked, imitating Harry S. Truman's reaction to the infamous headline
that incorrectly declared Thomas Dewey the winner in his race for
president.
   The Star-Banner was not alone in its presumption. All three
television networks called MacKay the winner shortly after 10 p.m.
   ``The science is not 100 percent,'' said ABC Director of News
Information Elise Adde, who said that of 68 initial projections, ABC
was wrong in one, the Maryland presidential race.

   A juvenile court on Wednesday acquitted a teenager
charged with hijacking a KLM jetliner last year, saying he was too
young to understand what he was doing at the time.
   Adalgisco Scioni was 15 years old on Dec. 23, 1987 when,
pretending he had a bomb in his bag, he hijacked a Boeing 737 en
route from Amsterdam to Milan.
   The jet was diverted to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport, where
the hijacking ended without injury after the boy released most of
the passengers and was captured by police.
   The boy turned out to have been unarmed.
   Adalgisco, who has an Italian father and a Dutch mother, was
described as being upset that his grandparents in the Netherlands
were sending him back to Italy.
   When he hijacked the plane, Adalgisco asked for $1 million and a
getaway plane. He was coaxed into leaving the airliner after he was
promised he would be put on a flight to New York.
   The Rome juvenile court, after brief deliberation, announced that
Adalgisco, because of his youth, was incapable at the time of fully
understanding what he was doing, the Italian news agency AGI
reported.

   Lowell P. Weicker Jr. conceded Wednesday
that his 18-year career in the U.S. Senate was over, and he called
Democratic Joseph I. Lieberman's victory by less than 1 percent of
the vote ``a clear mandate by the people.''
   Secretary of the State Julia Tashjian said Wednesday night that
the official vote totals showed Lieberman won by 10,052 votes, a
larger margin than the 8,208-vote spread the unofficial tallies
showed.
   She said it was Connecticut's tightest statewide election since
an attorney general's contest in 1970, but that it was not close
enough to order a recount.
   Lieberman had 688,494 votes, 49.76 percent, to the liberal
Republican's 678,442 votes, or 49.04 percent. Two third-party
candidates shared 1 percent of the total.
   Weicker, in a news conference in Greenwich Town Hall, shouldered
the responsibility for his defeat and ruled out any future in
politics or in the Bush administration.
   ``I'm a big guy. I take care of myself. I take shots, I've given
shots,'' Weicker said. ``I'm responsible for last night's results.
   ``I didn't lose this race by a few thousand votes,'' he said.
``In my mind and in my heart, I lost it by 100,000. ... This wasn't
a close race. It was a clear mandate by the state of Connecticut,
that matters that I stood for are not to their liking, and that
matters that Mr. Lieberman stood for are to their liking.''
   Weicker, a liberal Republican, said he might now choose an
academic career. He is a graduate of Yale University and the
University of Virginia Law School.
   Lieberman said the outcome reflected the voters' desire for
change and ``a desire for an advocate for the state, which of course
is what I've been as attorney general _ environment, consumers,
jobs, housing, drugs.''
   Secretary of State Julia Tashjian said final vote totals for the
Senate race would not be available until late Wednesday.
   Connecticut voters chose Republican George Bush, whose father
once represented the state in the U.S. Senate, over Democrat Michael
Dukakis. Bush had 739,757 votes, or 53 percent to Dukakis' 668,482,
or 47 percent..
   The Connecticut congressional delegation, three Republicans and
three Democrats, easily won re-election.

   President-elect George Bush, vowing to
revitalize government with ``a brand new team of people,'' has
instructed key figures from his campaign to develop priorities for
the crucial first 100 days of his coming administration.
   Even before Bush won the presidency, job applications were
pouring into his standby transition office. The stream of resumes is
expected to turn into a flood now at newly opened Bush transition
headquarters.
   Just hours after claiming victory, Bush took the first steps
Wednesday toward assembling his presidency.
   The president-elect, at a news conference in his adopted home of
Houston before flying back to Washington, named James A. Baker III,
his campaign chairman and longtime trusted adviser, to be secretary
of state. It could be the most important post in a Bush presidency,
given the vice president's emphasis on foreign affairs and his
interest in pursuing progress with Moscow.

   Michael Dukakis was back tending to Statehouse
duties a day after losing his bid for the White House, promising to
be Massachusetts' ``very best governor'' and warning that the
negative tone of this year's campaign set a dangerous precedent for
coming races.
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' Dukakis said Wednesday after spending
several hours catching up on state business. ``Almost doesn't count
in politics.''
   He said he felt no bitterness toward George Bush and was ready to
put the campaign behind him and complete the final two years of his
term as governor. Dukakis gave no indication whether he will run for
a fourth term in 1990 or seek the presidency again in four years.
   ``At this point my job is clear: I'm going to be the very best
governor of this commonwealth that I can be,'' Dukakis told
reporters. ``There's a lot to do. There are many challenges out
there ahead. What happens in the future remains to be seen.''

   With candles, prayers and a pealing of church bells, Americans
marked the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the ``night of broken
glass'' that shattered lives and illusions as it ushered in the Nazi
Holocaust.
   Synagogues, churches and schools in New York, Los Angeles, Miami,
Montgomery, Ala., and other cities on Wednesday commemorated the
Nazi riots of Nov. 9, 1938, when scores of Jews were killed and more
than 1,100 synagogues set afire. The anniversary also was marked in
cities in Europe.
   ``We all had before the Holocaust the hope of betterment of
man,'' Rabbi Gerald Teller told about 100 people at Ezra Habonim
Synagogue in Chicago. ``This day is one of reflection on a day of
broken glass and shattered dreams.''
   In New York City, Cardinal John O'Connor told nearly 1,000 people
who attended a service at St. Patrick's Cathedral about the candle
burning in the window of his residence.

   As Germans commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
Nazi pogrom called Kristallnacht, one of Europe's largest Jewish
cemeteries is in ruins and one of its most magnificent synagogues
remains a bombed-out hulk.
   Both sites are in East Berlin and have been focal points of
observances of the Nov. 9-10, 1938, attacks by Nazi thugs on Jews,
their businesses and synagogues that launched the Holocaust.
   In the 108-year-old Jewish cemetery, the graves of once-prominent
Berlin intellectuals, artists, scientists and businessmen are
overgrown by trees and shrubs. Visitors must weave through dense
underbrush to view gravestones toppling after decades of neglect.
   The once-ornate synagogue, built in 1866, escaped destruction
during Kristallnacht, which means `Night of Broken Glass' in German.
Witnesses say a police officer prevented Nazi brownshirts from
starting enough fires to destroy the building, then called a fire
brigade that put out the blaze.

   John Newton Mitchell, the gruff former attorney
general who went to prison for conspiring to cover up the Watergate
scandal in his friend Richard Nixon's White House, is dead at 75
after collapsing on a Washington street.
   Mitchell was the highest ranking of the government officials who
served time for the political scandal that brought about Nixon's
resignation from the presidency in August 1974.
   ``I considered John Mitchell to be one of my few close personal
friends,'' Nixon wrote in his memoirs. ``I believed that I owed my
election as president in 1968 largely to his strength as a counselor
and his skill as a manager.''
   An ambulance crew, alerted by a 10-year-old boy who was
skateboarding, found Mitchell unconscious on a street in the
Georgetown section of Washington in early evening Wednesday.
Mitchell had suffered a heart attack.

<HEAD>Nature Celebrates Australia's Bicentennial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The male image gets something of a lift in a PBS
series starting Sunday night, ``The Nature of Australia,'' showing
the animal world Down Under as more than just koalas, kangaroos and
crocodiles.
   The six one-hour shows on the PBS series ``Nature'' are its way
of celebrating Australia's bicentennial.
   Take for example the leafy sea dragon, one of several creatures
that practice a form of male pregnancy to protect their offspring.
This cousin of the seahorse lives off South Australia and is named
for its camouflage of leaf-like outgrowths that make it look like a
piece of kelp. It hatches its young _ up to 200 of them _ in
individual capsules that form soon after the female lays the eggs on
the male's tail.
   Then there's the marsupial frog, a rain-forest dweller whose
hatchlings wriggle onto their father's flanks and push their way
into pockets that have formed there to complete their development.
   Brooding also is a male task in the Great Barrier Reef among the
Australian pike fish, a long, thin speckled species that, after an
elaborate courtship ritual, takes the eggs from the female into its
pouch until the young emerge.
   And another resident of the reef off the northeastern coast of
Australia is the yellow-striped cardinal fish which incubates
hundreds of eggs clustered in a sticky ball _ in its mouth.
   Male pregnancy ``fascinates us because we're used to thinking of
females as the bearers of young, but of course that seems to be only
so among the higher mammals,'' said John Vandenbeld, executive
producer and writer of ``The Nature of Australia'' and author of the
companion book for the series.
   ``We tend to take a fairly species-centric view of evolution and
the world about us. Most creatures in the world tend to reproduce in
very, very different ways from the way we humans and most of the
higher mamals do. We probably are an exceptional group rather than
the other way around,'' Vandenbeld said in a telephone interview
from Melbourne, Australia.
   ``It fascinates us because it's at such a variance with the way
we look at things. It all makes perfect sense; it's all logical for
sea horses and those kinds of animals to organize their reproduction
in that way,'' said Vandenbeld, a long-time producer of
documentaries on the environment for the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation.
   The series episodes are ``A Separate Creation,'' how Australia's
wildlife came to be so different; ``Seas Under Capricorn,'' where
the male sea dragon gives birth; ``The Making of the Bush,'' for
fans of man-eating crocodiles; ``The Sunburnt Country,'' Australia's
outback; ``Land of Flood and Fire,'' with crocodile-eating men; and
``The End of Isolation,'' how conservationists are trying to bring
parts of the continent back from the brink of man-made devastation.
   ``Until not so very long ago, the idea most Australians had about
the environment was of a very rugged, harsh and alien kind of place
that you sort of had to conquer. There was a lot of fear and
loathing of what we call the bush among the early settlers. And the
only good tree was a tree that was cut down; the only good tree was
a dead tree,'' said Holland-born Vandenbeld, 48, who emigrated to
Australia when he was 15.
   ``That attitude obviously has changed dramatically over the last
few years,'' he said. ``We have such a unique environment,
absolutely unique plants and animals in many ways. It's a kind of
repository for things that have disappeared in the rest of the
world, and we still have the chance to keep many of these things.''
   Vandenbeld also said he hopes the series will change attitudes
about marsupials, mammals that raise their young in pouches.
   ``People tend to dismiss kangaroos, and marsupials generally, as
rather second-rate animals because they organize their reproduction
in what seemed for a long time as a kind of primitive way; an
intermediate step between reptiles and birds who have eggs and
mammals like us who bear live young,'' he said. ``One of the things
we've been able to do in this series is to demonstrate just how very
intricately marsupial reproduction is organized, how very precise
the various facets of this reproduction are tailored to this
particular environment and how well that reproduction is
orchestrated.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   ASPIRING TO `NOBLE FAILURE' _ Robert Altman will direct Carol
Burnett in a limited-run series for CBS next year. Burnett and
Altman worked together once before, in his ``A Wedding.'' The series
for CBS will likely run seven episodes and resemble in some respects
Altman's highly praised cable-verite series for HBO, ``Tanner '88.''
Burnett will play an actress on tour, sort of a story within a
story. These limited-run things are the way to go anymore, says
Altman, whose works are regularly praised by critics but are not
terribly successful commercially. ``We're hoping it will be a noble
failure,'' he said cheerfully at an election-night party in New York
for the Tanner cast and crew.

<TEXT>
   As anyone who follows the retail industry can
tell you, consumers just aren't spending the way they used to. Sales
at many of the nation's biggest retailers have been slow for almost
two years now.
   The retailers have learned to adjust, shifting the focus of their
business from generating sales to maintaining profits. And the
investment analysts who track retail companies are stressing cost
controls rather than revenue.
   So, everything is OK, right? Maybe we don't need to worry about
how many refrigerators Sears sold last month or how the white sale
went at Lord & Taylor.
   Wrong, the economists say.
   The retailers may have figured out how to survive the slump, but
the economy _ and the rest of us _ are likely to suffer in the end
if consumers continue to hold tightly to their purse strings.
   ``Any kind of slowdown (in consumer spending) will show up in
lower production and unemployment,'' warns David Wyss, chief
financial economist for Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,
firm that forecasts economic trends.
   Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of the economy's health. If
consumers make fewer purchases, they could force the economy to slow
down or even slip into a recession.
   So far, the slowdown in retail spending has not been readily
apparent in the GNP figures. The Commerce Department said overall
consumer spending increased by 3.5 percent from July through
September, following a 3 percent rise in the second quarter,
although at the same time, many big retailers reported their sales
couldn't keep up with inflation.
   What's happening is that Americans are spending more on other
things: cars and the gasoline to drive them, interest payments on
mortgages and other loans, medical care and their children's tuition.
   But, the economists note, as Americans pay more for necessities
and services, they are shying away from what's known as
discretionary spending _ purchases of clothing, dishwashers,
furniture and other items they don't really need.
   Therein lies the problem _ a drop in such spending means
consumers aren't buying as many discretionary goods, so companies
don't have to produce as much.
   And if manufacturers slow their assembly lines, they're likely to
lay off workers.
   What could save some of those jobs is continued growth in
exports. But, as Wyss noted, exports are not a panacea for the
entire U.S. manufacturing sector. The United States doesn't sell
many refrigerators overseas, so if the domestic market declines,
some workers may be on the street.
   A slowdown is inevitable, according to Wyss.
   ``The economy is expanding too rapidly,'' he said ``It can't
continue to go on.''
   The Federal Reserve Board board has been tightening credit _
raising interest rates in the process _ to try to put the brakes on
the economy.
   But as rates rise, the cost of borrowing goes up _ leaving
consumers with less to spend at department and discount stores. And
so the cycle will continue.
   ``In the long run, the recession is going to occur,'' Wyss said.

<TEXT>
   President Rodrigo Borja's first months in
office have restored a sense of calm to Ecuador, wracked in recent
years by political, economic and natural disasters.
   Borja, 53, a moderate leftist and leader of the Democratic Left
Party, took office in August, replacing his long-time political foe,
Leon Febres Cordero, a staunchly conservative and pro-U.S. leader.
   The mild-mannered Borja has spent time playing volleyball with
reporters and officiating at local speedway races. He has even
deserted his bodyguards to get shoeshines in this colonial city's
shady plazas.
   ``President Borja is not an autocrat enclosed in the presidential
palace,'' government television ads proclaim, in an effort to draw a
contrast with Febres Cordero, who carried a Colt .45 pistol and took
pride in his ``macho'' image.
   A recent poll of leading journalists indicated Borja's major
accomplishment so far has been ``restoring tranquility and avoiding
repression.'' The language was a clear reference to Febres Cordero's
turbulent style of governing and the frequent charges of human
rights violations made against his government.
   The currency exchange rate, considered a key economic signal, has
stabilized at about 485 sucres to the U.S. dollar after fluctuating
wildly for the past year.
   Independent economists have praised recent government austerity
measures to build up the nation's depleted foreign currency reserves
and to a cut a huge fiscal deficit and record-high annual inflation
of nearly 80 percent.
   In his inaugural address, Borja accused Febres Cordero of lying
about the seriousness of the country's financial plight and
deliberately leaving it bankrupt to cripple his incoming government.
   This Colorado-sized nation of 10 million people, wedged between
Colombia and Peru, has suffered in recent years from severe economic
problems and political instability.
   The turmoil was sparked in great measure by bitter disputes
between Febres Cordero and left-leaning parties that controlled
Congress, which at one point debated impeaching him.
   Ecuador's fledgling democracy was threatened in 1986 by a
military uprising led by Gen. Frank Vargas Pazzos, then air force
commander. The uprising failed and Vargas Pazzos was imprisoned.
Febres Cordero was kidnapped a year later by Vargas Pazzos' backers
and held for 11 hours until he pardoned the jailed general.
   A devastating earthquake in 1987 that crippled the vital oil
export industry for a half year and the collapse of international
petroleum prices also had disastrous economic effects.
   Borja is Ecuador's fourth president since democracy was restored
here in 1979, following a decade of military and civilian
dictatorships.
   Borja's party, which is affiliated with the international Social
Democrat movement, controls the 71-seat unicameral Congress. This
has virtually eliminated any possibility of the opposition blocking
Borja's policies, as occurred in the Febres Cordero administration.
   Borja has already made good on campaign pledges to seek closer
ties with the Non-Aligned Movment (the Third World) and to replace
Febres Cordero's free-market economic policies with greater
government controls.
   In one of his first official acts, Borja restored diplomatic
relations with Nicaragua's Sandinista government, which had been
severed during Febres Cordero's era. Cuba's Fidel Castro, in a rare
visit to South America, was a prominent guest at Borja's
inauguration. So was U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Borja says he intends to maintain close relations with the United
States, Ecuador's major trading partner.
   ``I believe there can be good cooperation between our government
and the government of the United States,'' he said.
   A government announcement in September of a plan to assume
control of the petroleum production operations in Ecuador of the
U.S. oil company Texaco Inc. sparked concern in international
financial circles of a leftist move to nationalize key industries.
   Borja quickly acted to restore confidence, explaining that the
government's intent was to gradually assume control over Texaco
operations as contracts expire.
   ``We are open to foreign investment in terms of mutual benefit,''
said Energy Minister Diego Tamariz.
   Borja's austerity package, which included a 36 percent
devaluation of the currency, exchange controls and gasoline price
increases, has drawn its heaviest criticism from the left, however.
   The Borja government has also announced plans to renew debt
negotiations with foreign creditors. Ecuador has paid almost nothing
on its $11 billion foreign debt since the 1987 earthquake.

   Perjury and obstruction of justice charges have
been brought against a one-time aide to a trader accused in the
Princeton-Newport Partners racketeering-securities case.
   A federal grand jury in Manhattan on Wednesday indicted Lisa
Jones, an employee of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. since 1981, for
allegedly giving ``materially false testimony'' to a grand jury.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said Ms. Jones, currently a

   U.S. District Judge William Hungate on Wednesday lifted a stay on
Interco's claim but did not set a date for a hearing. Hungate had

   The average bill examined was $39,000, and the average error was
$1,488, Equifax Inc. said Wednesday. There were few instances of
undercharging or non-billing, the company said.
   The errors showed up in a year-long audit of thousands of bills

   A large insurance company filed a lawsuit and

approved a measure sharply cutting the cost of auto insurance.
   In New York, stocks of several companies handling large amounts
of insurance in California dropped in early trading Wednesday with
the news that the Ralph Nader-backed initiative had passed. But they
recovered by the end of the day to end narrowly mixed.
   The approval of the initiative was a blow to the insurance
industry, which spent at least $60 million backing its own measures.

<TEXT>
   Speculation that gasoline supplies are running
lower than normal have boosted gasoline futures prices, lending
support to contracts for oil.
   The December contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up
0.86 cent Wednesday to close at 47.26 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, wiping out the 0.85 cent drop of Tuesday's
session.
   John Azarow, a trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the
market's perception that gasoline supplies were tight gave prices
their strength and carried other energy futures higher.
   The December contract for home heating oil rose 0.99 cent to
44.52 cents a gallon, after losing 0.60 cent the previous session.
   Azarow said there was some seasonal buying of heating oil, ``but
generally, I really think that gas is the key to prices.''
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 6 cents to close at $13.86 a barrel.
On Tuesday, the contract fell 26 cents.
   Trading was quiet in advance of meetings later this month of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Azarow said.
   OPEC members will be discussing ways of curbing production and
stabilizing prices.

   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell in the
government's latest auction to the lowest level at such a sale since
February.
   The average yield was 8.94 percent on Wednesday, down from 9.27
percent at the last auction on Aug. 10.
   It was the lowest rate since 10-year notes averaged 8.21 percent
on Feb. 3. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 8~ percent
with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,957.60.
   A total of $9.6 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$28.9 billion.
   The auction was the second part of the government's quarterly
debt sale to finance the $2.6 trillion national debt. On Tuesday,
the Treasury Department sold $9.5 billion in three-year notes at an
average yield of 8.59 percent, down from 8.77 percent at the last
auction on Aug. 9.
   The Treasury normally would sell 30-year bonds on Thursday, but
officials said they would not be sold this week because a bill from
Congress authorizing them has not yet been signed by President
Reagan.
   The department plans to auction $11 billion in 37-day cash
management bills on Thursday.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls In Europe, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in moderate European trading this
morning in continuing bearish reaction to George Bush's presidential
victory. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fell in Asia and early
European trading but recovered slightly as dealers bought dollars to
cover short positions.
   Traders said the only factor preventing the dollar going lower
was market fears of central bank intervention to prop up the U.S.
currency.
   The Bank of Japan stepped in early today following intervention
Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve. But no action by European
central banks was sighted this morning.
   ``There is still a bit of downward pressure, but the room on the
downside is limited,'' one dealer at a large West German bank said.
``Because of the Fed, Bank of Japan interventions, the market is
hesitant to sell dollars.''
   A Rome trader said he expected a period in which the U.S. and
Asian markets would push the dollar lower, while European markets
would be net buyers of dollars.
   He said the market was reacting to statements, rather than
fundamentals, especially those by officials seeking to lay the
groundwork for Bush's economic policy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 124.10 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted lower at 123.88 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7595 West German marks, down from 1.7665; 1.4785
Swiss francs, down from 1.4865; 6.0059 French francs, down from
6.0460; 1.9839 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9935; 1,310.50 Italian

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices edged down on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar finished trading at 124.10 yen, down 0.55 from
Wednesday's close of 124.65 yen. Opening lower at 123.95 yen, the
currency ranged between 123.76 and 124.30 yen. It was the first time
the dollar opened at the 123-yen level since April 18, when it
started trading at 123.83 yen.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan's intervention and buying by
speculators near the 123.7-yen mark saved the dollar from declining
further. The central bank routinely declines comment on its
activities.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today
``the recent currency situation requires coordinated intervention.''
   The present currency movements ``aren't good,'' he added.
   A dealer with Mitsubishi Bank said, however, the dollar's
downward trend still was strong in the market.
   The dollar was only slightly affected by Republican George Bush's
victory in the U.S. presidential election.
   ``Although Bush won as most market players had expected, many of
them are now cautious, wondering how the U.S. monetary policy will
be after the election,'' the dealer said, speaking anonymously.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained
205.51 points Wednesday, lost 46.36 points, or 0.16 percent, to
close at 28,166.42. The index gained 86.22 points shortly after the
market opened, then gradually fell.
   A dealer with Nomura Securities attributed the decline to
profit-taking, mainly in electronics and high-tech issues.
   ``But the higher yen helped financial issues finish higher,'' he
said, also speaking anonoymously.
   Trading was active with the volume on the first section estimated
at 1.2 billion shares.

<TEXT>
   Just after winning a 40-state election victory
on a vow of no new taxes, George Bush is giving some appearances of
flexibility on that stand, at least on the topic of ``revenue
enhancers.''
   At his first press conference as president-elect on Wednesday,
Bush was asked whether his oft-repeated opposition to tax increases
was meant to cover only a boost in personal income tax rates.
   While personal income taxes provide the bulk of the government's
revenues, large sums of money are also raised by a variety of other
taxes from gasoline levies to taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and
from fees charged for government services.
   Politicians who don't like to talk about raising taxes sometimes
say they would accept ``revenue enhancers.''
   Bush was asked whether he would also categorically rule out
``revenue enhancements'' of any kind as a way of reducing the
federal budget deficit.
   He essentially sidestepped the question, saying he would need a
definition of a revenue enhancement before he could answer.
   While Bush was dancing around the ``T'' word Wednesday, talk of
higher taxes filled the air in Washington:
   _ Senate Republican leader Bob Dole suggested stripping away the
tax deductions businesses now enjoy when they use borrowed money in
corporate buyouts. Dole said the huge corporate takeovers do not
benefit the economy. He said the tax deductions on buyout loans were
loopholes in the tax code which should be closed.
   _ Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told a conference
sponsored by the American Stock Exchange that it will be politically
impossible to balance the budget without tax increases. Volcker said
he believed income tax rates could remain unchanged but he suggested
boosting the gasoline tax by 60 cents a gallon over the next four
years and hiking taxes on alcohol and tobacco.
   _ The National Economic Commission, the high-level advisory panel
created by Congress to come up with solutions to the deficit
problem, announced a day-long hearing next Wendesday to launch its
post-election effort at coming up with a combination of spending
cuts and tax increases acceptable to the White House and Congress.
One of the leadoff witnesses will be Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who has already gone on record in favor of increasing
gasoline taxes.
   Officials of the commission said they are awaiting word from the
Bush transition team on the names of the two individuals the
president-elect will appoint to the panel. Many expect those
appointments will tell a lot about Bush's intentions on grappling
with the budget problem.
   In his meeting with reporters, Bush noted that he had been
attacked during the campaign for supporting higher taxes because of
his endorsement of the catastrophic illness insurance legislation
passed this year by Congress.
   As he did during the campaign, Bush insisted that the measure was
not a tax increase even though the new law hikes the monthly
Medicare insurance fee paid by Social Security beneficiaries and
imposes an income-tax surcharge on wealthier retirees to pay for the
expanded health benefits.
   ``I'm talking about holding the line on taxes, and I don't plan
to deviate, and I think the American people must have understood
that when they voted in rather large numbers for my candidacy,''
Bush said.
   Still, some private economists said they believed Bush's vague
answer on revenue enhancers signalled a shifting position.
   ``Eventually Bush is going to have to back off of his
commitment,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group,
an economic forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``The deficit problem has not been resolved and there are
enormous pressures building for increased spending'' to fight the
drug problem and bail out hundreds of insolvent savings and loan
institutions, Chimerine said.
   After dropping sharply in 1987, the budget deficit began rising
again in the just-completed fiscal year, climbing to $155.1 billion,
with many economists predicting it could climb above $160 billion
this year.

<TEXT>
   
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics in Washington, said foreigner investors could lose
confidence unless Bush acts quickly to get the federal deficit under
control. Foreigners have grown in importance for the more than $100
billion a year they lend the U.S. economy.
   A panic by foreign investors could send the dollar into a
tailspin, pushing up interest rates in this country and toppling the
U.S. economy into a recession, Bergsten warned in a new book
published today, ``America in the World Economy.''
   Without strong efforts to balance the budget, Bergsten forecast,
there would be: ``A sharp fall in the dollar _ as much as 20 percent
to 25 percent. Inflation, double-digit interest rates. Recession.''
He added that foreigners probably would not wait much beyond the
first two months of the new administration to see action.
   ``By Easter (March 26) we'll be well on a good road _ or in the
soup,'' he said.

   Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, one of Bush's economic
advisers, also voiced concern Wednesday about the willingness of
foreigners to continue financing U.S. deficits without significant
progress on the budget deficit.
   But unlike many economists, Feldstein said he believed Bush's
plan for a ``flexible freeze'' on spending would be an effective way
of reducing the budget deficit.
   Feldstein said the Bush plan could reduce the budget gap to 1
percent of the overall economy, as measured by the gross national
product, in four years, down from more than 3 percent currently.

   The Semiconductor Industry Association
said its book-to-bill ratio, the chip industry's key indicator of
future sales, fell in October to its lowest point in three years.
   The ratio, which compares semiconductor orders to shipments,
dropped to 0.92 for the month, meaning that $92 worth of chips were
ordered for every $100 worth sold, the association said
   Average monthly orders for the three-month period ending in
October totaled $1.06 billion, 8.7 percent below the figure for
September.
   The latest ratio was ``much worse than we originally thought,''
said John Nguyen, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``I
still don't think we have enough data to say for sure that we are
entering a major down cycle,'' he added.

<HEAD>Trade Surplus Climbs in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower oil and textile imports in October helped
boost Japan's trade surplus to $7.69 billion in October, up 13.09
percent over a year earlier but slightly lower than in September,
the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
   But Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell for the
10th straight month from year-earlier levels to $4.83 billion in
October, down 3.1 percent from $4.98 billion in the previous year
but up from $4.65 billion in September.
   Exports to the United States rose 7.9 percent from a year earlier
to $8.34 billion, while imports from the United States climbed 27.7
percent to $3.51 billion, the ministry said.
   Officials noted major increases in U.S.-bound exports of
semiconductors and passenger vehicles. Japan's exports of
semiconductors to the United States jumped 54.7 percent to $314
million, while vehicle exports grew 9 percent to $2.47 billion.
   Japan's total $7.69 billion trade surplus in October compared
with $6.8 billion in October 1987 and $7.74 billion this past
September. In August, Japan's trade surplus was $4.94 billion.
   Japan's exports during October rose 13.2 percent from a year
earlier to $23.38 billion from $20.66 billion, and imports also
climbed 13.2 percent to $15.7 billion.
   After rising for 15 months from year-earlier levels, the nation's
trade surplus reversed direction in July. This trend raised concern
among officials that the surge could aggravate trade friction.
   Finance Ministry officials said weaker imports from Southeast
Asia and lower crude oil prices were the main reasons for the
faster-growing trade surplus. Crude oil prices averaged $11.92 per
barrel in October, down 33 percent from a year earlier.
   Japanese customers bought less crude oil in the expectation that
a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could
further reduce global oil prices, the officials said, speaking
anonymously. Crude oil imports fell 4.1 percent to $1.17 billion in
October.
   Lower textile products from Southeast Asia boosted Japan's
surplus with the region to $1.81 billion, more than twice the
year-earlier level.
   October's trade surplus exceeded the levels expected by local
analysts and dealers in financial markets.
   Exports in October were figured at an average exchange rate of
132.04 yen to the dollar, compared to 144.50 yen a year earlier.
Imports were pegged at 132.58 yen, versus 144.59 yen.
   Japan measures its trade surplus on a customs-clearance basis,
which includes freight and insurance costs on imports but not for
exports. Its trade surplus would be higher if those costs were
included in both categories.

<HEAD>Prices Flat; Drought's Effect Easing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices remained flat in October after
seven straight monthly increases as the cost of food fell for the
first time since February, the government said today.
   Analysts said the stability in the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index for the first time in eight months signifies a tapering
off of the effects of the summer drought, which had sent food prices
up 3.5 percent since May.
   Wholesale food prices, led by large declines for fruits,
vegetables, bakery products, pasta, beef and cooking oils, fell 0.1
percent last month. That was their first decline since February, the
Labor Department said.
   Food prices had skyrocketed 1.2 percent in September.
   Seasonally adjusted energy prices rose by 0.3 percent last month
after falling by 3.3 percent in September. Following sharp declines
over the summer, natural gas rates jumped 4.6 percent last month
while gasoline prices held steady and home heating oil prices fell
10.1 percent.
   Wholesale prices for goods other than food and energy were
unchanged last month. Automobile, home appliance, drug and
children's apparel prices fell. Prices rose for women's and men's
clothing, household furniture, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages and
prescription drugs.
   Before seasonal adjustments, the Labor Department's index for
goods one step short of the retail level rose 0.6 percent to 109.3,
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 at the
wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $109.30 last month.
   That same marketbasket of goods would have cost $108.60 in
September and $107.70 a year ago.
   The seasonal adjustment process is designed to remove
predictable, periodic influences from the calculation of price
changes.
   Analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjusted
prices and real ones was primarily connected with the introduction
of 1989-model automobiles.
   ``Because auto rebates (on 1988 models) were smaller than normal
in September, price increases in October were less than seasonally
expected,'' said Donald Ratajczak, head of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University in Atlanta. ``Also, price rebates began
almost as soon as new vehicles reached dealers.''
   Sticker prices on 1989 models were an average of 7.5 percent
above what the 1988 models were selling for in September, the Labor
Department said.
   But it put the value of quality changes such as
government-mandated passive restraints, new corrosion protection and
improvements in powertrains at $153.69 per vehicle, or 34.6 percent
of the average $444.08 increase in price to dealers.
   Including seasonal variations intended to spread the increase
associated with new models across the year, new car prices were
calculated as falling 1.7 percent.
   Alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.6 percent on the wholesale level
last month after declining by 0.3 percent in September. Women's and
men's apparel costs were up 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent respectively
while prices for children's clothing fell 0.3 percent after rising
0.6 percent in the back-to-school buying month of September.
   Prescription drug prices rose 0.4 percent and are now 9.3 percent
above what they were a year ago. Cosmetics rose 0.5 percent on
October but are only 2.9 percent higher than for the same month in
1987.
   Household furniture prices rose 0.8 percent last month and are
4.5 percent above what they were a year ago. Including a 0.5 percent
decline last month, wholesale prices for household appliances have
risen only 0.7 percent in the last year.
   Overall, wholesale prices for finished goods other than food and
energy have risen 4.1 percent in the last 12 months, slightly less
than a 4.5 percent increase in consumer prices over the same period.
   Energy prices on the wholesale level have fallen 5.9 percent over
the year while food prices have risen a total of 4.5 percent, the
Labor Department said. In all, wholesale prices are 2.9 percent
above what they were in October 1987.
   Price declines of 9.2 percent for fruits, 1.9 percent for
vegetables, 5.8 percent for pasta, 0.9 percent for fish, 4.0 percent
for cooking oils and 1.6 percent for beef and pork paced the 0.1
percent drop overall in wholesale food prices last month.
   Offsetting those large declines were increases of 1.9 percent for
processed chickens, 8.0 percent for turkeys, 7.3 percent for eggs
and 1.0 percent for canned fruits and vegetables.
   Ratajczak said the lower beef and pork prices reflect unusually
large pre-frost slaughters because of high feed grain costs.
   Prices for intermediate goods further back in the production
chain _ items such as plastic parts, cement, paints, fertilizers,
lumber and chemicals _ also were flat in October but are 5.3 percent
higher than they were a year ago.
   Raw material prices for crude products such as oil, agricultural
commodities, scrap aluminium, iron ore and timber declined 0.1
percent last month and are only 0.5 percent above what they were a
year ago, the department said.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. said it plans to
sell its unprofitable South African subsidiary to Unidev Ltd., a
South African holding company for an undisclosed amount.
   ``While we continue to be committed to contributing to social
change in South Africa, the long-term economic viability of the
business can be better served with South African ownership,'' Robert
Price, Control Data's chairman, said Wednesday.
   Control Data, which began operations in South Africa in 1964,
will maintain a legal entity in South Africa for continuing several
education and community development initiatives, funded by a
permanent trust, the company said.
   Control Data withdrew only from owning a subsidiary in South
Africa, not from doing business there. Control Data will continue to
sell computers and services to South African customers through
Unidev, said Frank Ryan a Control Data spokesman.
   The company's Johannesburg-based subsidiary accounted for less
than 1 percent of the company's 1987 revenue of $3.4 billion, Ryan
said.
   The company's business involvement with South Africa had in
recent years generated considerable criticism from church groups and
some pension funds opposing South Africa's racially separate
apartheid society.
   Groups that owned stock in the company used Control Data's annual
stockholders' meetings as a forum for their protests.
   As a result of its continuing indirect presence in South Africa,
the pressure on Control Data from antiapartheid groups may be eased
but not stopped.
   Many church groups, colleges and others who have joined the
divestment movement as a means to end apartheid are demanding that
companies not just sell their South African operations but that they
cut ties altogether.
   Control Data South Africa's 123 employees will be transferred to
Unidev under the terms of the agreement.

   Stock prices were mixed in dull, early trading
today with many investors reluctant to make commitments in the face
of the market's uncertain direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.52 points at
2,123.76 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Advancing issues lead declining issues by about 6 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 459 issues up, 384 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was 16.65 million shares.
   Analysts said the market remains in a sort of holding pattern
this morning with many investors uncertain about its direction in
the aftermath of the presidential election. In addition, investors
are reluctant to make commitments in advance of the three-day
holiday weekend and ahead of next week's new economic statistics.
   Traders said this morning's flat Producer Price Index for October
did little for the financial markets.
   ``There are still a lot of questions about the Fed tightening ...
and that is keeping a lot of institutional investors on the
sidelines,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice president at Dillon,

   The New York Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.36 at
154.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market index
was down 0.01 at 294.03.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 9.25
points at 2,118.24 after an erratic session in which the blue-chip
indicator opened lower, rallied before midday, then plunged more
than 20 points at mid-afternoon.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 2-to-1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
949 issues down, 493 up and 511 unchanged.

<HEAD>GTE Announces Personnel Reduction of 7,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. is taking a much-needed step as
well as following a national trend by announcing it would trim 7,000
jobs _ some through layoffs _ in the next four years, analysts said.
   ``They definitely have too many people relative to other
telephone companies,'' Geoff Johnson, a telecommunications analyst
with Argus Research in New York, said Wednesday after the company
announced the planned cuts.
   ``It's also part of a broader trend in the industry ... everyone
has been trying to cut costs and reducing through attrition early
retirement,'' he said.
   GTE said the previously announced restructuring of its telephone
operations would result in nearly 7,000 personnel reductions by 1992.
   The company said in a statement the reductions would come from
staff functions that support local service operations. Total
employment for GTE's domestic telephone companies and associated
headquarters staff is about 85,000 and about 28,000 of those people
are in staff positions.
   GTE announced plans to streamline its telephone operations in
March to continue improving service quality and to become faster,
more flexible and responsive to customer requirements.
   The company said some of the reductions would come from early
retirement offerings.
   ``We expect as many as 2,000 people may take advantage of this
(early retirement) option,'' said Kent B. Foster, group vice
president of GTE Telephone Operating Group. ``In addition, we have
had a virtual hiring freeze in place throughout most of this year,
so a number of already-vacant positions simply will go unfilled.''
   He said some employees would be reassigned to positions in other
GTE businesses.
   ``Some layoffs are inevitable, however, and will be used only as
a last resort,'' Foster said. ``The majority of these will come from
our management ranks and will occur over time.''
   The company would not project the number that would be laid off.
   Johnson projected that GTE's plan could save them about $93
million a year for three years. He said that savings does not
include severance costs.
   James L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, said
``These reductions are expected to generate substantial annual cost
savings, which will be reflected over time in rate reductions to GTE
customers and in improved earnings for GTE shareholders.''
   Johnson also said that additional reductions unrelated to this
restructuring would occur over the next five years as the company
institutes changes brought about by new technologies.
   GTE had revenue of $15.4 billion in 1987. Its three core
businesses _ telecommunications, lighting and precision materials _
employ about 161,000 people in 44 states and 38 other countries.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Corn Harvest Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened modestly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to an increase in
the Agriculture Department's corn-production estimate.
   In a report issued Wednesday afternoon, the USDA raised its
projection for the 1988 U.S. corn harvest to 4.67 billion bushels, 3
percent above last month's forecast but still the smallest corn crop
since 1983.
   Soybean production was forecast at 1.51 billion bushels, up 1
percent from last month's estimate but within the market's
expectations.
   The unexpectedly high corn estimate led to a weaker opening
across the board, but wheat quickly turned mixed in response to the
USDA's downward revision of its world wheat production estimate,
analysts said.
   ``The world production report indicated Argentina's and
Australia's wheat crops would be smaller than projected last month
and those are major competitors, so that's positive for the wheat
market,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.25\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2} cents lower with December at $2.76} a bushel; December
oats, the only active contract in early trading, were 3 cents lower
at $2.20 a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 4 cents lower with
November at $7.92{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle .02 cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at
73.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with November at 81.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .33 cent higher with December at 40.75 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .38 cent higher with
February at 44.30 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Wednesday.

   The dean of the University of
California's school of education has resigned to become a vice
president at Apple Computer Inc., which gains a third of its
domestic revenues from education.
   Bernard R. Gifford, who came to Berkeley in 1981, said on
Wednesday he will give up his post at the end of the year to take
charge of Apple's marketing efforts in education.
   ``I'm very proud of my colleagues at the School of Education and
of the progress we have made in making the school one of the best in
the country,'' said Gifford. ``I have been an Apple user for a long
time, and at Apple I hope to be a forceful advocate of the
intelligent use of computers in teaching and learning on a national
level.''
   Gifford, 45, took the job at Berkeley when the education school
was in such bad shape a special campus commission called for its
closure.
   He brought in high-caliber faculty and recruited record numbers
of students. His fund-raising work added $12 million a year to the
school's educational research program.
   Gifford's post at Apple will make him one of the highest-ranking
blacks in the computer industry.

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The $4.4 billion super collider project involves building a
53-mile-long, racetrack-shaped tunnel, around which two beams of
tiny particles would race in opposite directions. The purpose is to
create head-on collisions.
   From the crashes, physicists hope to learn whether matter is made
up of even smaller building blocks than those identified so far, and
learn more about the particles of matter and the forces that act on
them.
   The super collider would use some 10,000 superconducting magnets
to guide the two beams of particles, called protons. It is called a
``super collider'' because it would accelerate the protons until
they packed some 20 times the punch _ or kinetic energy _ that
existing machines can create.
   At that energy level, a proton would have only about as much
kinetic energy as a mosquito in flight. But a proton is extremely
small: a row of 100 billion protons would extend the width of a
human hair. So it packs its energy very densely, and the high
density is what physicists are looking for.
   As the two beams of protons intersect in the super collider, most
would pass through unscathed. But when a collision smashed a
``quark,'' or a building block, of one proton into the quark of
another proton, a huge amount of energy would be released.
   The energy would turn into jets of tiny new particles, some of
which may never have been observed before.
   The trajectories and other properties of the particles created in
the collisions would then be studied for clues to the world of the
very, very small.

<HEAD>Britain's Flamboyant Socialist Tycoon Takes Giant Step</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Robert Maxwell won a takeover battle for
Macmillan Inc., the flamboyant socialist tycoon silenced his
doubters and took a giant step toward fulfilling his dream of
creating a global communications empire.
   The success of his $2.6 billion bid for the U.S. publishing and
information services giant, after months of opposition, was sweet
vindication for the 65-year-old British press baron.
   Although he had succeeded at smaller U.S. acquisitions, Maxwell
had failed in previous attempts to take over major American
companies _ namely Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. and Bell & Howell
Co.
   These highly publicized failures over the past few years had
caused some Maxwell-watchers to question his goal of building
Maxwell Communication Corp. into one of the world's top 10 media
companies.
   Under the circumstances, Maxwell's public response to the
Macmillan victory was uncharacteristically subdued. ``I didn't feel
anything,'' he said at a New York press conference last week. It's a
major responsibility that falls on my shoulders.''
   Maxwell, who is motivated in part by a desire to compete with his
archrival, publisher Rupert Murdoch, said he plans further
acquisitions as he tries to reach his revenue target of about $5
billion to $9 billion.
   The combined 1987 revenue of Maxwell Communication, of which he
is chairman, and Macmillan is about $2.6 billion.
   Overcoming obstacles is nothing new to Maxwell, a large, dashing
man with swept-back black hair and bushy eyebrows over mischievous
eyes.
   Maxwell, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was
born Labji Hoch, the son of Lithuanian Jewish peasants who were
killed by the Nazis during World War II.
   Of his early life, Maxwell said in a recent interview on London
television: ``If you really want to know what it is like, you would
have to go to Dickens as it was.''
   Maxwell emigrated to Britain as a teen-ager in 1940 and he says
he arrived penniless, clutching a rifle and speaking no English.
   The self-educated Maxwell, who went to primary school for only
three years, taught himself the language _ which he speaks with a
distinctly upper class accent and in a booming voice _ and joined
the British army.
   He became a captain and a war hero, winning the coveted Military
Cross for bravery.
   In one episode characteristic of his ruthlessness at war, Maxwell
executed a German civilian, the mayor of a town, who had hoisted a
white surrender flag to decoy Maxwell's troops into an ambush by the
German army.
   Maxwell's letter about it to his French-born wife said: ``I had a
very amusing day yesterday...''
   In the TV interview, Maxwell recalled the incident with regret,
attributing it to his temper. ``I was 20 years of age and one treats
the war as partially fun,'' he added in explanation of the letter to
his wife.
   After the war, Maxwell turned his attention to business and
politics. He bought Pergamon Press, a publisher of scientific
journals, in 1951, and launched a political career as a Labor member
of Parliament.
   While some point to a contradiction in his socialist politics and
capitalist ambitions, such questions haven't kept Maxwell from
enjoying all the trappings of his wealth. He lives in a mansion near
Oxford, and comes and goes from his offices near Fleet Street in a
helicopter. He entertains on a yacht previously owned by the wealthy
Khashoggi family of Saudi Arabia and he owns one of Britain's
first-division soccer teams.
   Maxwell says that when he was young, his mother blamed his
father's and other men's joblessness on ``conservative politicians
all over the world.''
   ``And I have ever since then, never been able to support anything
conservative,'' Maxwell said.
   Maxwell's first really big business break came in 1981 when he
bought the struggling British Printing and Communication Corp.,
Britain's largest commercial printer, and turned it around.
   Today, Maxwell Communication employs 17,000 people and had net
earnings of $235 million on revenue of $1.6 billion last year.
   Ironically, Maxwell said after the Macmillan victory that he
intends to sell the pivotal British commercial printing business and
possibly other Maxwell Communication and Macmillan assets to focus
more on publishing.
   In 1984, Maxwell bought the Mirror Group Newspapers _ which he
holds privately _ winning control of a national newspaper, which had
been one of his many ambitions.
   Maxwell's left-wing Daily Mirror is Britain's second-largest
daily with a circulation of 3.25 million. It competes with the
conservative Sun, the No. 1 seller with circulation of 4.1 million.
The Sun is published by Murdoch, at whom Maxwell constantly jabs.
   Although his London Daily News folded within months of its launch
in late 1986, the undaunted Maxwell earlier this year announced
plans to publish a newspaper called the European that would cover
the continent. Maxwell expects the paper to debut in the spring and
attract 600,000 readers.
   He says he has been motivated through the years by a desire to
``make a small contribution to halting the retreat of these islands
which has gone on for so long that the natives have forgotten that
they are walking backwards.''
   To say that Maxwell is patriotic is an understatement.
   ``Britain became my home, virtually from the day I landed here,
and I shall die here,'' he said.
   Although Maxwell loves Britain, not all of Britain loves Maxwell.
What puts many Britons' teeth on edge is his reputation for being a
pushy self-promoter. Maxwell, who has been dubbed ``Captain Bob'' by
the British press, is often pictured in newspapers, frequently
wearing a cap.
   Maxwell lore has it that this self-made man long has yearned for
acceptance, which he denies.
   ``I'm in the information and communications business and the
media. Inevitably that carries with it the high profile you
mentioned,'' Maxwell said in the TV interview. ``I don't want
admiration.''
   Maxwell says his biggest achievement is not business-related.
Noting that he and his wife have been married 44 years and have
seven children, some of whom work in the business, Maxwell said, ``I
hope (the) major achievement you'll accept is really the family.''

<HEAD>Hail to the Chief: Business Advice for Bush</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the future leader of the world's largest economy,
President-elect George Bush is making the adjustment from a seeker
of people's votes to a weigher of their demands.
   Bush's biggest job from now until his inauguration is to plan an
agenda for business and the economy that balances the competing
needs and desires of all the American people. It won't be easy.
   The Associated Press conducted interviews on the morning after
the election with 13 Americans in business, and they predictably
disagreed on their advice to Bush.
   The interviewees ranged from the heads of AT&T and the UAW to the
leader of a bailed-out Texas thrift, a cookie millionaire, a Weight
Watchers franchisee and the operator of an Iowa grain elevator.
   Below, in their own words, are the leaders' tips to the
president-elect:

   The president faces no challenge more important than keeping the
economy strong. He has to make sure the economic expansion continues
at a steady pace and work toward holding down inflationary pressures
and interest rates.
   He should take steps to encourage increased savings and
investment in the United States. We have a 4 percent savings rate;
Japan has a 17 percent rate. Savings is the key to stimulating
innovation in the economy and creating jobs.
   As the baby boom population approaches retirement, the strains on
the Social Security system will be unbelievable. We need tax
incentives to encourage savings and investment.

   I'd like to see us compete in the world markets with our
agricultural products. We haven't been able to do that until the
last few years. We need to move products overseas and keep our
production plants running.
   We know we're going to have to buy something from them if they
buy from us. I want to see Third World countries developed in terms
of buying our goods. We have to have some way to move products.
   We know the world needs that food, so we have to figure out ways
to get it out of the country and still make it profitable for our
country.

   The president certainly has to deal with the deficit. We can't
continue to spend more than we make, and in that sense our
government isn't a heck of a lot different from a household. You can
carry a certain amount of debt, but we're getting to the point where
we have more debt than we can comfortably carry, and it's likely to
have a material effect on interest rates ...
   It's terribly important that the administration understands that
the financial services industry in Texas is in collapse _ it's not a
problem, it's a collapse that's not going to get fixed with a
Band-Aid. We should bring some sound and solid non-partisan thinking
to this problem.
   He should execute a national housing policy that will enable
lenders to provide loans for home buying. We're making loans, but
we're not doing it successfully.

   The next president should put a stop to the open hostility toward
unions that we've had from the past administration and the current
National Labor Relations Board.
   The NLRB under President Reagan took very one-sided, anti-labor
positions that have crippled organizing drives and made it much more
difficult for unions to represent members effectively. Congress
intended the NLRB to be a neutral agency, and the president should
seek to restore that neutrality.
   There also are a whole range of workplace issues ... like an
increase in the minimum wage, a requirement that everyone who works
receives minimum health care benefits from their employers, child
care and parental leave packages and notification of potential
health hazards for those working in a high-risk environment. It's
shear baloney that this would interfere with competitiveness.

<TEXT>
   Basically the president has to make the assets of this country
more productive, and if we don't do that, we will fast become a
second- or third-rate power. We have to make top management
accountable ...
   If top management doesn't do the job, remove them. We need simple
legislative changes like those that exist in England, where if
somebody wants to make an offer for a company, they have to have the
capital. And a simple rule that if someone makes a credible bid for
a company, shareholders should be given the right to vote on that
offer.
   Management can recommend they reject the offer, but shareholders
should decide. We shouldn't have to fight with poison pills, court
cases, scorched-earth policies. Once you have a certain amount of
stock and make an offer for a company, the shareholders vote ...
   In addition, pension plans should not be controlled by the
corporation. Managers of the funds feel beholden to the company.
What should be done is have a board of say, retired judges, people
above reproach with no agenda, who are allowed to appoint pension
managers, so if a manager votes (shares in the pension plan) against
incumbent (management in a takeover), their job is not threatened.

   The president has to recognize that women are a huge and
permanent part of the work force _ they will outnumber men as
workers in the next 20 years.
   There must be policies that reconcile their responsibilities at
work and at home _ like child care and equal pay for part-time work
so that part-time jobs are not a way to reduce labor costs but a way
to fit the genuine needs for both management and workers.
   We need to increase the minimum wage at the very least _ the
minimum wage currently pays less than the poverty level for a
working couple. You will not build a strong work force that can
improve its productivity on that basis.
   In addition, compared with our competitors, the U.S. has the
lowest rate of literacy, and it's the only industrialized nation
that doesn't have a family leave policy. We also need minimum health
insurance because so many workers are not covered by health care.

<HEAD>Texas Gets Collider, If It's Built</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary John Herrington today
announced the selection of Texas as the site for the highly prized
$4.4 billion super collider atom smasher _ if the giant research
installation is ever built.
   Seven states had vied for the project because of the economic
benefits tied to the construction of the collider, a 53-mile
underground ring of 10,000 magnets capable of whipping proton beams
together with 20 times the force of the world's most powerful
existing particle accelerator.
   Herrington said the Texas site _ some 16,000 farm acres in Ellis
County south of Dallas _ was ``superior'' to the others.
   The decision, he said, was based in part on site geology,
regional resources and environmental criteria.
   ``The Texas proposal clearly received the highest overall
technical evaluation ratings of any proposal and exhibited no
significant overall weaknesses,'' Herrington said.
   The six other contenders were Illinois, Arizona, Colorado,
Michigan, North Carolina and Tennessee. They were chosen from a
field of 25 bidding states by an independent panel appointed by the
Energy Department.
   Officials of some of the losing states, however, linked Texas'
selection to Tuesday's election of George Bush, who lives in Texas,
as president. `The Department of Energy made a decision ... based on
politics rather than on merit and the good of the American
taxpayer,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill. ``I do not believe that the
timing of this decision and its proximity to the election is a
coincidence.''
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said the decision ``has a strong
smell of White House politics. That was our major concern all along.
... We and the other five finalist states got a raw deal.''
   But Herrington told reporters the selection was made purely on
technical merits and added, ``I have to tell you there are no
politics in this.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and the unsuccessful Democratic vice
presidential candidate, said today's announcement made this ``a
wonderful day for our country and out state.''
   He pledged as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to do
``everything in my power to guarantee (that) the funds for
construction are appropriated on time. ... I am happy to have had a
hand in bringing it about.''
   The Energy Department must now prepare a full-fledged
environmental statement. Assuming nothing in the statement
disqualifies the Texas site, Herrington will make its selection
final in January.
   Congress has not yet appropriated money to build the collider,
but did provide $100 million in the current fiscal year for
engineering design and certain research and development items. In
all, Congress has appropriated only $205 million for the collider.
   Herrington said the facility, if it is built, will be named the
``Ronald Reagan Center for High Energy Physics'' because Reagan ``is
the president who had the vision to move forward with the
outstanding scientific project of this century.''
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who announced his state's selection
earlier in the day, called the collider ``the most important
scientific project that will be built anywhere in the world in the
last quarter of the 20th century.''
   The project is viewed as a plum for its host state because of the
economic benefits it will provide: thousands of construction jobs,
permanent employment for as many as 3,000 people and an annual
budget of $270 million.
   The contending states spent years and millions of dollars trying
to persuade the Energy Department to put the project on their turf.
Lobbying continued right up to the last minute.
   In an effort to attract the project, Texas voters approved a $1.1
billion bond package that would reduce the federal cost of building
the atom smasher south of Dallas.
   The concept behind accelerators is not new; E.O. Lawrence won a
Nobel Prize for inventing the cyclotron in the early 1930s.
   The Texas project will be the most powerful accelerator ever
built, taking advantage of the discovery that at close to absolute
zero, or minus-450 degrees fahrenheit, certain materials lose all
electrical resistance. The loss of resistance is called
superconductivity.
   In the Waxahachie accelerator, protons will travel toward each
other from opposite ends of the machine and will collide at speeds
up to 20 times those produced by the fastest existing accelerator
outside Chicago.
   When the protons collide, they will break into smaller particles,
called quarks, whose paths and behavior will be monitored closely as
scientists explore the tiniest yet-discovered building blocks of the
universe and the laws that determine their arrangement.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boosted in part by the drop in oil and
natural gas prices, the Texas petrochemical industry is booming
again.
   Texas plants are operating at full capacity along the Gulf coast,
and are announcing expansions because they're running out of room to
produce ethylene and other basic petrochemicals.
   The resurgence of the business comes at a time when the Texas
economy is feeling the pinch of lower crude oil prices. But like
other ``downstream'' refining and processing operations,
petrochemicals are benefiting from lower prices for raw materials.
   Petrochemicals are derivatives of crude that are used in a wide
range of consumer and industrial products. The list goes on and on:
plastic bags, automobile springs, water pipes, computer chips,
paints, medicines, carpets, clothes, shoes, luggage, furniture, heat
shields for rockets _ even diapers, made of polypropylene.
   ``In my opinion, it's the bright star in the Texas economy,''
said state Comptroller Bob Bullock.
   The Houston Economic Development Council says 70 plant expansions
valued at a total of $4 billion have been announced for completion
by 1991 from Corpus Christi to Louisiana, a 250-mile stretch of
coastline that supplies two-thirds of the nation's major
petrochemicals.
   Some of the biggest include a $600 million Dow USA ethylene plant
at Freeport, Texas, and three Quantum Chemical Corp. ethylene and
polyethylene projects worth $400 million in Houston.
   The council said the proposed Formosa Plastic Corp. USA plant at
Point Comfort, Texas, a $3 billion complex, is scheduled for
completion by 1993. The project would create 1,500 jobs and have an
annual payroll of $85 million.
   Analysts estimate that in so-called bulk chemicals, such as
ethylene, a $1 million investment equals only one new job. But even
so, the petrochemical industry ``pumped more than $2 billion in
wages and salaries into the Texas economy in 1987,'' according to
the state comptroller's office.
   Dr. Charles Holland, professor emeritus at Texas A&M University
and president of the Texas Institute for Advancement of Chemical
Technology, called Texas ``the high-tech chemical center of the
world.''
   The initial petrochemical boom came with the need for synthetic
rubber and antiknock gasoline in World War II. It grew until the
1970s when the Arab oil embargo and worldwide overcapacity set it
back.
   The industry retrenched again during the 1981-82 recession, when
the oil companies cut costs, closed plants and laid off workers.
   In addition to lower crude prices, a decline in the value of the
dollar has contributed to the industry's recent recovery. Senior
economist Thomas Plaut of the comptroller's Economic Analysis Center
said the dollar's 30 to 40 percent drop from the middle of 1985 to
the beginning of 1987 helped revive the export business by making
U.S. petrochemical products more competitive in world markets.
   ``Out of something bad comes something good,'' observed Bullock,
noting how when oil prices are down, petrochemicals pick up.
   Petrochemical exports from Texas in 1984 totaled $3.9 billion, 35
percent of the value of all manufacturing exports from the state,
Plaut says.
   Texas had 45,749 jobs in petrochemicals in the first quarter of
1988, up 1,081 jobs, or 2.4 percent over the same period last year,
the comptroller said.
   Another 30,000 Texans were employed in petrochemical-related jobs.
   According to Holland of A&M, the Texas chemical industry and its
associated consumer product industries support 11 percent of the
nation's gross national product.
   The chemical engineering professor believes the chemical industry
_ not computers, electronics, or space _ may be the best bet for
Texas' economic future.
   However, Holland says, the public perception of all chemicals as
``bottles of fuming, smelly liquids, or poisonous gases'' must be
changed.
   ``In times past,'' he said, ``the industry's position (on risks)
was not to say much _ `Let the public relations guy handle it.' Now,
the industry is much more public-conscious minded and feels it is
better to tell all.''
   Holland says continued petrochemical growth is expected
throughout the 1990s, with a 65 percent increase in production over
1982 recession levels by 1995.
   The value of an $18 barrel of crude oil increases to $21 when
converted in Texas to gasoline and $54 when converted to chemicals,
he said. The figure ranges from $840 to $2,700 per barrel when the
potential value of consumer products made with chemicals is
estimated.
   Developing its own consumer product industry ``constitutes one of
Texas' greatest opportunities,'' Holland said. Those industries
would not have to be located near the chemical complexes but could
be inland, in any part of the state.
   Such industries might produce furniture, wall coverings,
textiles, bottles or paints.
   ``Everything that you lay your eyes on in a modern building came
out of a chemical plant or was touched by chemicals,'' said Holland.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Pillsbury Shareholders' Request In Takeover Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state judge today left intact the ``poison
pill'' defense that Pillsbury Co. is using to try to thwart a $5.23
billion takeover bid by the British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan
PLC.
   But in denying a request from Pillsbury shareholders that the
food company's board be forced to drop the pill, Hennepin County
District Judge Thomas Carey urged negotiations between Pillsbury and
its suitor.
   ``The Pillsbury board must be left to do its own work, but it
seems to this court that direct negotiations may be justified,'' he
said.
   Carey said there were no legal issues that would prevent
Pillsbury, the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company, from
negotiating the $60-a-share offer from Grand Met.
   The British firm also has asked that the pill _ which allows
shareholders to buy Pillsbury stock at a steep discount and raises
the cost of a hostile takeover _ be removed so shareholders can
consider its offer.
   But on Monday, retired Justice William Duffy of the Delaware
Chancery Court denied Grand Met's motion to suppress the pill. He
ruled that, as of Oct. 17, Pillsbury's directors had not abdicated
their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting Grand Met's offer.
   Pillsbury announced Monday it was spinning off its Burger King
restaurant division to stockholders, and Grand Met responded by
renewing its motion before the Delaware court.
   On Wednesday, Duffy denied Grand Met's request for a rehearing,
but said he could still consider scheduling another hearing on the
issue if Grand Met files new evidence.
   The poison pill would allow Pillsbury to issue new stock that
Grand Met would have to acquire to take control of the company. The
cost of a takeover would rise to about $20 billion.
   Analysts differed on whether the poison pill could stymie Grand
Met's takeover offer.
   ``The poison pill is a significant deterrent to closing the
transaction,'' said Allen Finkelson of Cravath, Swaine & Moore,
Grand Met's New York law firm.
   But Craig Carver of the investment firm Dain Bosworth Inc., said
Pillsbury's poison pill defense was a small bargaining chip.
   ``I would not anticipate that would hold much water, given the
fact that 75 percent of the shares have been tendered anyway,'' he
said. ``Frankly, I would anticipate the two companies to sit down
and negotiate at the table.''
   On Wednesday, Grand Met said nearly 63.4 million shares, or 74.3
percent of Pillsbury's outstanding stock, had been tendered under
its offer.
   The British firm also increased the pressure on Pillsbury by
extending its offer, which had been scheduled to expire Tuesday
night, until midnight Nov. 14.
   Analysts had speculated Grand Met would extend the offer to
demonstrate to Pillsbury a strong showing among shareholders who
have agreed to sell their shares.
   Grand Met had to say how many shares were tendered, or offered
for sale, if it was to extend the buyout offer. With the offer
extended, however, shareholders could take back their shares until
the next Grand Met deadline.
   Carver said, ``I think (Grand Met) is continuing to apply
pressure to Pillsbury's board. Grand Met is obviously dealing from
strength here.''
   ``I think the ball is back in Pillsbury's court,'' he said.
   Carver said he expected the two companies will ``sit down and
negotiate at the table.''

   Stock prices were little changed Thursday as the
market continued to show a lack of direction.
   The weakness of the dollar against most major currencies raised
concern about the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates.
   Over one-quarter of the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock
index shares finished unchanged, ``an indication of the
directionless state of our market at the moment,'' one market
watcher said.
   The index finished up 0.5 point, or 0.03 percent, at 1,826.2.
   Volume was moderate, with 586.7 million shares changing hands,
compared with the 522.5 million shares traded Wednesday.
   London traders said the lack of direction from Wall Street kept
British equities hemmed into tight ranges.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 4.98 points at 2,113.26
when London trading ended, having moved little from its opening
level.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday blocked Elders IXL Ltd.
from buying any more stock in the British brewer Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries PLC.
   The move came after the Australian-based Elders bought up 10
percent of stock following a government decision to investigate its
hostile bid for Britain's fifth largest brewer.
   The government also blocked Elders, which now holds more than 24
percent of Scottish and Newcastle's shares, from exercising the
voting rights of more than 15 percent of Scottish and Newcastle's
stock.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young dramatically stepped in, and issued
the orders under the Fair Trading Act after Elders confirmed it had
sharply boosted its holding in Scottish and Newcastle by purchasing
about 35 million shares in the market Thursday.
   Elders made the purchases after Young referred Elders' 1.6
billion-pound, or $2.8 billion, offer to the Mergers and Monopolies
Commission to determine its effect on competition.
   Elders' bid, of 400 pence a share, automatically lapsed because
of the referral.
   Scottish and Newcastle shares fell 16 pence to finish at 390
pence on London's Stock Exchange.
   The target company complained ``with very grave concern'' about
Elders' stock purchase, saying such actions were prohibited under
British takeover regulations.
   ``Elders appears to be attempting to pre-empt the outcome of the
monopolies commission inquiry,'' it said. ``Scottish and Newcastle
regard this situation as quite intolerable.''
   Elders countered that it had not broken the rules.
   ``There is a brief window between the recommendation and the MMC
actually sitting and reviewing the matter. It was during that window
that we acquired the shares,'' according to a spokesman for Elders'
Courage subsidiary, who was not identified in accordance with
British practice.
   Earlier, Young, saying the bid ``raises questions of competition
in the brewing, wholesaling and retailing of beer,'' asked the
commission to report its findings within four months.
   John Elliott, Elders' chairman and chief executive, said he was
``shocked and disappointed'' by the investigation.
   Elders said the company would argue its case during the
investigation in the hopes of being allowed to resume its bid.
   Elders already owns Britain's sixth largest brewer, Courage
Holdings Ltd. The acquisition of Scottish and Newcastle would give
the combined group a 21 percent share of the country's beer market,
a Department of Trade and Industry spokesman said.
   Elders has argued that its takeover of Scottish and Newcastle
would increase competition in the brewing industry by presenting a
more formidable rival to market leader Bass PLC, which has about 22
percent of the British market.
   The commission also has been conducting a long investigation into
the British system of ``tied'' public houses, under which a brewer
owns a chain of pubs and markets its own brands through them. That
report is due to be completed Feb. 3.

<HEAD>Texaco Finalizes Refining Venture With Saudis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. said Thursday it signed a
definitive agreement with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. on their previously
announced venture to jointly refine and market petroleum in the
United States.
   Texaco will receive $812 million for a 50 percent interest in its
refining assets and marketing system in 23 East and Gulf Coast
states. The oil company said it expects to enjoy an additional $1
billion in cash benefits and savings resulting from the joint
venture.
   The agreement, which was originally outlined in June, provides
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, with a secure outlet
for its products while virtually guaranteeing Texaco a steady stream
of crude at market prices.
   The joint venture will be known as Star Enterprises and will be
headquartered in Houston.
   The company will operate three major Texaco refineries _ in
Delaware City, Del.; Convent, La.; and Port Arthur, Texas. It also
will operate about 1,450 owned and leased service stations and
distribute products to more than 10,000 stations. It will employ
5,000 people and is expected to be in operation by Dec. 31.
   The Saudis will provide 75 percent of the Star Enterprises'
initial oil inventory. The joint venture will retain the right to
buy up to 600,000 barrels of crude from the Saudis each day at
market prices.
   At the signing of the agreement in London, Texaco President James
Kinnear called the joint venture ``one of several major steps we
have taken to restructure Texaco and to enhance shareholder value.''
   Earlier this year Texaco emerged from protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It has been
selling off $5 billion in assets to offest the disastrous effects of
prolonged litigation with Pennzoil Co., which resulted in the
bankruptcy court reorganization and a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil.
   The oil giant also survived a bitter power struggle with its
largest shareholder, financier Carl Icahn, who attempted to acquire
the company for about $14 billion.
   Observers have taken issue with the Saudi venture on the grounds
that it raises questions about increased foreign leverage over the
U.S. oil industry, which has become increasingly reliant on imports.
   The venture is believed to be the biggest of its kind between a
foreign supplier and a domestic oil company in the ``downstream''
end of the business _ the process for changing crude into gasoline
and other products.
   The Saudi government has hinted that Saudi Arabia is interested
in forming more marketing joint ventures. Oil industry sources said
the kingdom was interested in linking up with European companies.

   Stock prices edged up in dull afternoon trading
with little fresh news to give the market direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched up 0.71 points at
2,118.95 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator has floated
aimlessly since the opening bell, from more than 5 points higher 30

uncertainty following the presidential election.
   In addition, concerns about the dollar and interest rates

   The most urgent problem facing the president regarding

   Beyond that, our concerns will unfold as the new Congress
attempts to put through a number of mandated benefits which are
linked to the deficit ... like mandatory health insurance, the
parental leave issue, the dual-shop question and increased minimum
wage.
   That's pretty tough medicine to apply to a lot of companies
trying to compete in the world marketplace. The president has got to
be alert to these heavy burdens on the competitive capabilities of
companies and try to head off as many as possible in terms of the
entire payment burden being placed on an industry.

   Being a mother of five and a businesswoman, I see the most
important issue as education. It's been weak in Bush's campaign, and
he really has to take a strong look at it.
   From kindergarten on, we must start teaching our kids parenting,
human relations, the peril of drugs .... History must be taught in
better ways so our children have role models to grow up to. We have
Bushes and Dukakises who are young children now, and if we don't
take proper care of them, how are they going to take care of
themselves?
   Child care is very important, and somebody has to supplement the
cost of child care facilities. And if we are to get the proper
people into jobs, we need to provide equal pay for women.
   The president should take a mean, hard look at the welfare
system. We are paying people and they are losing their self respect.
He has to find a way to give them jobs.

   I'd like to see Bush aggressively enforce the U.S.-Japan
semiconductor trade agreement. He needs to make a greater effort to
ensure that semiconductor relationships with Japan are conducive to
competition and that we're not taken advantage of by Japanese
government and industry.
   We feel that there has been some progress in stopping the dumping
of Japanese products; we hope it's cured and not just in remission.
But in the access area, they are not living up to their side of the
agreement. A great deal of political pressure must be put on the
Japanese to have our products sold there.
   Overall, what America needs is the kind of attention paid to
economic policy that we put on security and defense policy.

   When government has sound economic policies and acts with fiscal
sanity and allows the economy to grow in a non-inflationary way, I
don't see any need for special favors for any industry segment
whatsoever.
   But we're not there now and we can't be with the budget deficit.
If we are going to move forward into the next decade with the
entrepreneurial renaissance that has captured the imagination of the
world, we have to defuse the ticking time bomb of federal debt.
   The president should start by slowing the rate of government
spending to match the rate of growth of the economy. There's a
crying need for strong presidential leadership with a far stronger
use of the veto.
   We need reforms in the budget process. We're putting our children

   The auto industry is a very important part of the economy, and it

   Everyone is concerned over the deficit. In the import world, we
have concern over the importance of the free market. Bush believes
in open trade, and that's good for our economy when it moves both
ways. We need to continue an open market.
   Encouragement of more companies building plants in this country
to increase employment is going to help.
   The trade bill is a tough bill, but it will probably get better
handling under Bush because of his belief in open markets.

   Perhaps the most important test of the next president's personal
leadership will be his success in alerting all Americans to the
urgency of our economic challenges. They revolve around the concept
of deficits, and not just the twin deficits of trade and the budget.
   We are running serious deficits in productivity growth, capital
investment, non-defense R&D (research and development) and in the
quality of education.
   Correcting these deficits isn't a job for one man alone, or one
presidential administration. But I would hope that the next
president has courage to lead us in that direction.

   Traders said this morning's flat wholesale prices as measured by
the Producer Price Index for October had little impact on the
financial markets.
   ``The market was looking for good PPI numbers. They were good but
not great,'' said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko
Securities International. ``It was not enough to make people come
off the sidelines.''
   The Labor Department announced that wholesale prices were mostly
unchanged after seven straight monthly increases, with food prices
down for the first time since February.
   Analysts said the market traded in a narrow range, drifting up a
few points then down a few points, and appeared to lack direction
with little news to stir investor sentiment.
   Oil and auto stocks had a mostly positive session but recent
takeover stocks changed direction during the day. Most stocks seemed
to lack focus, traders said.

   Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual
funds rose $2.6 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $274.63 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.42 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 224 general purpose funds rose $828.5 million to $87.21
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds increased $1.18 billion
to $116.11 billion, and assets of 128 institutional funds rose
$596.7 million to $71.31 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.56 percent from 7.55 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.53 percent from 7.51 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38
days, up from 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was
unchanged at 6.08 percent as of Wednesday.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, also was unchanged, at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.84
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up slightly from 7.83
the previous week. Yields were 8.14 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.13 percent; 8.32 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 8.55
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.54 percent.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in choppy trading Thursday as
dealers continued to focus on the nation's looming trade and budget
deficits.
   Gold prices also fell. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $418.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down
from $422.50 late Wednesday.
   After plunging on Wednesday, the dollar continued to recede as
the election earlier this week that will put Republican George Bush
in the White House faded into a non-event for currency dealers.
   ``There's nothing to say,'' said Robert Ryan, senior trader at
Irving Trust Co. ``The market realizes we still have the same
problems,'' a reference to the twin deficits.
   Ryan said there was virtually no reaction to statements by
Japanese and British officials that there won't be a meeting of the
Group of Seven major industrialized nations before their already
scheduled meeting in April. The G-7 finance ministers have worked to
promote exchange rate stability.
   Despite its drop, the dollar held to a fairly narrow range in
worldwide trading amid fear of central bank intervention and the
feeling among some dealers that the U.S. currency might be due for a
technical bounce higher.
   ``The dollar still looks reasonably soggy, but I'm wondering
whether it will kick back up at some point,'' said Steve Grossman, a
corporate dealer at the Bank of America in London.
   Comments by the Bank of Japan saying it would consider seeking
help from the European central banks to support the dollar gave the
currency ``a little lift,'' said Lou Calvello, a trader at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``But it drifted off again shortly after those statements,'' he
said. ``A lot of people are still bearish on the dollar.''
   Dealers said market attention was turning toward the next set of
U.S. trade figures, due on Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 124.10 yen. Later
in London, it was quoted lower at 123.90 yen. In New York the dollar
finished at 124.05 yen, unchanged from Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7970 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7890 late Wednesday. In
New York it cost $1.7975 to buy one pound, more expensive than
Wednesday's $1.7930.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7540 West German marks, down from
1.7635; 1.4745 Swiss francs, down from 1.4830; 5.9970 French francs,
down from 6.0180; 1,307.00 Italian lire, down from 1.312.65, and
1.2217 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2312.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7565 West German marks, down from 1.7665; 1.4765
Swiss francs, down from 1.4865; 6.0065 French francs, down from
6.0460; 1.9825 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9935; 1,311.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,319.50; and 1.2246 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2325.
   Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion
slipped to $419.00 a troy ounce, from $423.10 on Wednesday.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid of $419.75 a troy ounce,
compared with Wednesday's late bid of $423.25. In Zurich, gold fell
to a closing bid of $419.70 from $420 bid late Wednesday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold rose $2.91 to a bid $424.23.
   Silver bullion prices were mixed. On the New York Comex, silver
fell to $6.411 a troy ounce, from $6.548 on Wednesday. But in
London, the metal rose to a late bid of $6.48 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $6.44.

<HEAD>Gap Reports Big Third-Quarter Profit Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gap Inc. on Thursday reported its third-quarter profit jumped 43
percent from its severely depressed results of a year earlier.
   Meanwhile, May Department Stores Co. said its earnings for the
quarter increased nearly 50 percent, in part because of gains from
the sale of real estate and its Loehmann's specialty store division.
   Gap reported net income of $26.6 million, or 73 cents per share,
compared with $18.6 million, or 52 cents per share, in the same
period last year.
   Third-quarter revenue totaled $322.8 million, up from the $273.6
million reported for the comparable period in 1987.
   The results were a marked improvement over the dismal performance
of third-quarter 1987, when Gap and other retailers began a
year-long sales slump that decimated their profits.
   The retailers have shown signs of recovery in the latest quarter,
but industry analysts are warning their profits may look stronger
than they really are because of the comparison with last year's weak
showing.
   Gap operates 887 stores, including 705 Gap, 108 Banana Republic,
66 GapKids and eight Hemisphere outlets.
   May reported net earnings of $133 million, or 91 cents a share,
compared with net earnings of $89 million, or 57 cents a share, for
the same period last year.
   Revenue for the third quarter was $2.8 billion, compared with
$2.4 billion in the same period of 1987.
   May's sale of the 76-store Loehmann's chain resulted in a pretax
gain of $47 million.
   Other unusual items that affected third-quarter results include a
pretax gain of $18 million that occurred when the company dissolved
a real estate partnership and a pretax gain of about $15 million
from the sale of two parcels of real estate.
   May is one of the largest retailers in the United States, with
3,047 stores, including Lord & Taylor, Hecht's and Famous Barr
department stores and the Caldor and Venture discount store chains.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Gap reported net income of $42
million, or $1.15 per share, compared to $47.9 million, or $1.34 per
share, for the same period last year.
   Revenue for the nine months totaled $828.4 million, compared to
$702.4 million for the same period last year.
   May said its year-to-date earnings totaled $258 million, or $1.74
a share, on revenue of $7.69 billion, compared with earnings of $214
million, or $1.38 a share, on revenue of $6.93 billion for the same
period last year.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Oct. 31, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,040.2 billion in the week ended Oct. 31 from $3,035.6
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,869.6 billion from $3,867.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $784.4 billion from $780.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $1.179 billion in
the week ended Nov. 2, compared with a decline of $258 million in
the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $283.5 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$283.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Mortgage Bankers Urge Bush To Cut Deficit, Even Raise Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers who lend money for housing urged
President-elect George Bush on Thursday to take early steps against
rising home mortgage rates and said they favor a broad-based tax
increase if necessary to ease the deficit and save the housing
market.
   ``We hope ... that the Bush administration, as a last resort,
will not foreclose the option of raising new revenues if necessary
to bring down the deficit,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vice
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   ``He has to find a way to step away from his read-my-lips
philosophy,'' said Lasko, referring to Bush's campaign pledge not to
raise taxes.
   But Lasko told a news conference that housing lenders would
oppose any effort by the administration or Congress to eliminate or
reduce the income tax deduction home buyers can take on their
mortgage interest. He said such a move would be a tax increase.
   Lasko said the association, which represents 2,800 mortgage
companies and other lenders, hopes Bush will give increased
attention to housing in line with his promise for a ``kinder,
gentler nation.''
   He said the new president and Congress will have ``an opportunity
to weave a stronger thread of home ownership and housing opportunity
into the social fabric of the nation.''
   The association says home ownership is declining in relation to
the population, with eight percent fewer families headed by men and
women between the ages of 30 and 34 owning homes now than did when
Reagan was first elected in 1980.
   It also says home buying takes a bigger bite out of family
income, rents are higher, low-income housing is scarcer, vacancies
are higher among high-income units, and 9.5 million American
families live in substandard housing.
   Lasko criticized the Department of Housing and Urban Development
under Reagan for failing to work with Congress or with state and
local officials to combat the housing problem.
   ``HUD has been negligent in recent years in not attending to the
fact that housing and community building are to be carried out with
governors and mayors,'' he said.
   Lasko noted that interest rates on home mortgages have been
creeping up in the past week and said they could reach 11 percent by
the end of the year, further slowing housing markets.
   Increases in the amount of public and private debt tend to push
interest rates up, and Lasko said the United States has become a
nation ``addicted to debt.''
   He said Bush's first priority for benefitting housing should be
to decrease the deficit. ``Nothing affects housing affordability
more than interest rates,'' he said.

   Texas beat out six other states Thursday in a
high-stakes race to capture the $4.4 billion superconducting super
collider, which, if Congress finds the money to build it, would be
the largest scientific instrument ever constructed.
   The announcement by Energy Department Secretary John Herrington
drew immediate howls of protest from losing states, where officials
had waged a years-long battle to win the giant atom-smasher and the
jobs and scientific prestige that will accrue to the project's home
state.
   ``The Texas decision has a strong smell of White House
politics,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``We and the other five
finalist states got a raw deal.''
   Illinois officials also were angered, with House Minority Leader
Robert Michel calling on the president to review Herrington's
decision declaring Texas the preferred site for what the department
will name the Ronald Reagan Center for High Energy Physics.
   Eight senators _ Alan Dixon and Paul Simon of Illinois; Riegle
and Carl Levin of Michigan; Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of
Arizona; and Tim Wirth and William Armstrong of Colorado _ asked
Reagan to establish a bipartisan commission of physicists that would
review all seven of the finalist sites. The others sites are in
North Carolina and Tennessee.
   The senators said if the project ``is to have the slightest
chance of being funded,'' the president must demonstrate the Texas
decision ``was based solely on scientific criteria utilizing a fair,
open and competitive bidding process.''
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said his state ``should be proud of its
efforts.''
   Herrington said the Texas site _ some 16,000 farm acres in Ellis
County 35 miles south of Dallas _ was ``superior'' to the others for
building the collider, a 53-mile underground tunnel capable of
whipping proton beams into each other with 20 times the force of the
world's most powerful existing particle accelerator.
   ``The Texas proposal clearly received the highest overall
technical evaluation ratings of any proposal and exhibited no
significant overall weaknesses,'' Herrington said.
   Herrington said the Texas site would best ``permit the highest
level of research productivity and effectiveness'' at a reasonable
cost of construction and with minimal impact on the environment.
   ``I have to tell you there are no politics in this,'' Herrington
told a news conference attended by such prominent Texans as House
Speaker Jim Wright and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, both Democrats, and Sen.
Phil Gramm, a Republican.
   The decision was announced two days after Bush, an adopted Texan,
was elected president.
   Questions remain whether money ever will be appropriated to build
the super collider, an unprecedently powerful machine that
physicists hope will help them explain the very origin of matter
itself.
   Many in Congress argue the project will starve other more useful
scientific research. Congress has kept the project on a short leash,
and only agreed to provide $100 million this year for research and
engineering design. None of that may be used for construction.
   Nonetheless, states eagerly sought the projects, which is
expected to create 3,000 scientific jobs and 3,500 construction
jobs, great prestige and a non-polluting industry with untold
scientific spinoffs for the host state.
   Herrington said the collider is absolutely necessary to keep
scientific leadership in the United States.
   ``Most of the leadership in high-energy physics is headed for
Europe,'' he said. ``We need to keep those people in the United
States.''
   The collider will put ``Texas on the cutting edge of high-energy
physics,'' Bentsen said. He pledged as chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee to do ``everything in my power to guarantee (that)
the funds for construction are appropriated on time.''
   The department now must prepare a full-fledged environmental
impact statement. Assuming nothing in the statement disqualifies the
Texas site, Herrington will make the selection final in January.
   The department's site selection task force did not compare the
sites but found that the Texas site was the only one rated
outstanding on the four most important criteria.
   Those were geology and the ease of tunneling, regional resources
such as schools and access to airports, environmental problems and
site problems such as acquisition of real estate.
   On the other two important criteria, site conditions such as
vibration and utility service, Texas was rated good, one notch below
outstanding.
   Tennessee had three ``outstanding'' ratings, but was rated only
``satisfactory,'' below good, on regional resources. Colorado,
Illinois and Michigan had two ``outstanding'' ratings each.
   Texas was about in the middle of estimated costs of building the
collider and operating it for 25 years. The department estimated the
total at $10.8 billion in 1988 dollars for Texas, possibly as low as
$10.4 billion for Illinois and as much as $11.5 billion for Arizona
and Michigan, with the others somewhere in between.
   Dixon, an Illinois Democrat, charged the administration was using
the super collider as a ``political tool.''
   ``The Department of Energy made a decision based on politics
rather than on merit and the good of the American taxpayer,'' Dixon
said. ``I do not believe that the timing of this decision and its
proximity to the election is a coincidence.''
   Herrington said all states had asked that the selection be
delayed until after the election, and that the department was
confident that any examination of the decision would show that it
was not politically biased.
   The report of the department's Site Task Force rated Illinois
``poor'' on real estate factors, the only such ranking given. The
report noted ``strong landowner opposition'' in the area and limited
land acquisition expertise by state authorities.
   Herrington said the facility will be named after Reagan because
he ``is the president who had the vision to move forward with the
outstanding scientific project of this century.''

   Investors have given George Bush a warning to fix
the U.S. trade and budget deficits in a surprisingly cool
post-election reception that battered the dollar and forced stocks

   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
9.25 points Wednesday to 2,118.24.
   Although a Bush win in the presidential race had been anticipated

   Corn production is expected to total 4.67
billion bushels this year, 3 percent above last month's forecast but
still a drop of 34 percent from the 1987 crop, the Agriculture
Department reports.
   The searing heat and lack of rain was reflected in an average
yield per acre of 83.2 bushels for corn forecast Wednesday by USDA.
That was down 37.1 bushels from last year but 2.1 bushels above the
level contained in last month's forecast.
   As farmers struggled to bring the last of the corn out of the
fields, the falloff in production reflected last summer's fierce
drought.

   Copper futures prices plummeted Thursday on reports that the
Southern Peru Copper Co. had reached a labor agreement with its
white collar and clerical workers and was nearing settlement of a
3{-week-old miners' strike.
   On other markets, precious metals prices also fell sharply;
soybean futures plunged while grains finished lower; livestock, meat
and energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The spot copper price on New York's Commodity Exchange fell 8.75
cents _ the steepest one-day decline in the Comex spot copper
contract since Feb. 1 _ to $1.4325 a pound, more than 10 cents below
the record high of $1.538 established on Nov. 2.
   The most active contract, for delivery in December, tumbled 8.85
cents to $1.3675 a pound.
   The sell-off was prompted by a midday report that Southern Peru
Copper, the biggest copper-mining firm in the world's sixth-largest
copper-producing country, had come to terms with striking clerical
and white-collar employees, analysts said.
   The company's miners remained on strike but company officials
reportedly said they may reach an agreement with them by Monday. The
workers have been on strike since Oct. 18.
   Earlier in the day, Southern Peru declared ``force majeure'' on
shipments of 3,000 metric tons of copper to European customers,
meaning it would be unable to honor those commitments, and said
shipments of another 4,000 metric tons would be delayed.
   But the copper market failed to rally on that ostensibly bullish
news.
   The strike has been a major factor in the copper market's surge
to record highs. And while worldwide supplies are expected to remain
tight well into next year, the market's behavior may indicate that
the dramatic rally has peaked, analysts said.
   ``Whether they're moving close to a settlement or not, this
raises a flag: has the top been put in or not,'' said Craig Sloane,
a metals market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York.
   ``Today feels more like we've topped than any other day we've
had,'' he said. ``This is how the market acts when it's at the top.''
   Precious-metals futures prices also fell sharply, partly on
profit-taking ahead of the Veterans' Day bank holiday on Friday and
partly in reaction to a rise in short-term interest rates, analysts
said.
   On the Comex, gold settled $4.10 to $4.50 lower with December at
$420.50 a troy ounce; silver was 13.7 cents to 14.6 cents lower with
December at $6.44 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices plunged on heavy selling near the close of
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, dragging down wheat and oat
prices and spurring further declines in an already weak corn market.
   The collapse apparently was triggered by a massive sell order
from the Iowa Grain Co., a large commodities brokerage firm that had
purchased about 5 million bushels of soybeans early in the session
and sold them all back shortly before the close, analysts said.
   The corn market had been weak all day in response to a slight
increase in the Agriculture Department's estimate for 1988 U.S. corn
production.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with the contract for
delivery in December at 4.24} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 5 cents
lower with December at $2.74{ a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 7{
cents lower with December at $2.15{ a bushel; and soybeans were 13
cents to 27\ cents lower with November at $7.73 a bushel.
   In livestock and meat futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
December at 72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with November at 81.10 cents a pound; live hogs
were .70 cent lower to .55 cent higher with December at 40.72 cents
a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .53 cent lower
with February at 44.12 cents a pound.
   In energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 12 cents higher
with December at $13.98 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to .72
cent lower with December at 43.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .14 cent to .26 cent higher with December at 47.40 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 stocks settled .10 point higher at 274.15.

   The market turned in a mixed performance Thursday
in what some analysts said was a dull, uninteresting day on Wall
Street with little to stir investors.
   ``Nobody had any conviction to do anything, to be aggressive
buyers,'' said Michael Metz, vice president for Oppenheimer & Co.
``Short-term, the market is trying to find its footing.''
   Analysts said the problems that plagued the market before
Tuesday's presidential election _ the dollar, interest rates and the
deficits _ returned to prey on investor confidence. Those concerns
kept institutional investors on the sidelines.
   ``They're concerned that they have lots of cash, but they're
uncertain of the market's direction given the changing of regimes,''
said Philip Puccio, senior vice president for Dillon, Read & Co.
``So they don't want to make any major commitments.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 3.55 to close at
2,114.69 after drifting in a narrow range.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 128.92 million shares,
down sharply from 153.14 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 156.162 million shares.
   Advancing issues barely outnumberedterms of
what we need to do,'' he said. ``They are lazy targets.''
   Ian Burton of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Toronto,
Canada, advocated ``ecological equity'' in which the industrialized
nations chiefly responsible for polluting the atmosphere would cut
back more than Third World countries on emissions that harm the
ozone layer.
   Equity was one of several philosophical issues raised at the
conference.
   The Hamburg Manifesto does not point fingers at those responsible
for the pollution or say who should clean up.
   It concentrates instead on measures that would slow the melting
of polar ice caps and destruction of the ozone layer, which some
predictions say will occur by the middle of the next century.
   Hans-Juergen Karpe, chairman of the drafting committee, said the
conference would reassemble in two years to evaluate how well the
recommendations had been followed. He is a professor at the
University of Dortmund's Institute for Environmental Protection.
   In its first draft, the Manifesto did not set pollution limits or
specific objectives for reducing harmful emissions that cause the
greenhouse effect.
   Under pressure from Third World representatives and environmental
groups, conference organizers inserted words specifying the aim of
reducing cardon dioxide emissions 30 percent by the year 2000 and 50
percent by 2015.
   Third World delegates represented about 10 percent of the
participants. When they sent the organizers a message saying they
still were dissatisfied with the document, Karpe said another
version addressing their concerns would be issued later.
   A report last month by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
echoed other warnings that average temperature would rise as much as
four degrees in the next 50 or 60 years.
   Atmosphere specialists say such a rise would be enough to parch
existing farm belts, cutting crop yields by up to 25 percent. Water
and energy shortages also are forecast, along with more frequent
floods, drought and violent storms.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose slightly Thursday, on
speculation that central banks in Europe would help prop up the
dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose [ point, or $1.25 for
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction and is an indicator of interest rates, fell to 8.98
percent.
   Bonds received relatively little support from a Labor Department
report that wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last month,
traders said.
   Low inflation preserves the value of fixed-income securities, and
a report of flat prices usually buoys the bond market. But after a
brief uptick following the morning report, prices fell back.
   Traders said the Treasury bond market had trouble absorbing
primary dealers' sales of three- and 10-year notes that they had
bought at auction earlier in the week.
   The rumor that helped the bond market was that the Bank of Japan
would ask European central banks to join it and the Federal Reserve
in supporting the value of the dollar, according to Joseph Plocek,
chief economist of McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc.
   ``The one item that will be required to turn dollar psychology
around is coordinated intervention,'' Plocek said. Prospects of a
declining dollar cause investors to flee from dollar-denominated
securities.
   Despite the rumor, the dollar finished the trading day unchanged
against the Japanese yen and slightly lower against other major
currencies.
   Plocek said bonds were also helped somewhat by cuts in short-term
interest rates by the Japanese and West German central banks.
   In the secondary market for existing Treasury bonds, prices of
short-term government issues slipped 1-32 to 1-16 point,
intermediate maturities were unchanged, and 20-year issues rose 3-16
point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.12 to 1,144.21.
   Corporate bonds also rose. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate
Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds
with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.18 to 294.85.
   Municipal bonds edged upward. The Bond Buyers Municipal Bond
Index of 40 long-term, investment-grade issues rose to 91] from 91\.
   Yields on existing three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose to
7.90 percent as the discount rose 8 basis points to 7.65 percent.
Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.21 percent as the discount edged
up 4 basis points to 7.79 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to
8.38 percent with the discount up 3 basis points at 7.80 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Foreign investors, wielding burgeoning
influence over the U.S. economy, will give President-elect George
Bush two months at most to get a grip on the troublesome federal
budget deficit, a Washington research institute warned Thurday.
   Meanwhile, the administration unhappily projected the fiscal 1990
deficit at $132 billion, up $21 billion from its forecast just three
months ago, when Bush was nominated, and $32 billion over the legal
limit allowed without new taxes.
   The Institute of International Economics, echoing concerns by
private economists and U.S. business leaders, said that without
quick action by the Bush administration to reduce the budget
deficit, the country could face a financial crisis and possible
recession as foreign investors pull out.
   ``The precarious international economic and financial position of
the United States represents the most serious threat to the
country's continued economic expansion and financial stability,''
the institute said in its new book, ``America in the World Economy.''
   The United States is now forced to look abroad for more than $100
billion in new foreign loans and investment each year, the book
noted.
   If the new administration appears headed for further stalemate on
the budget deficit, foreigners might suddenly decide the United
States was no longer a good investment opportunity, said institute
director C. Fred Bergsten.
   A panic by foreign investors could send the dollar into a
tailspin and seriously threaten U.S. well-being, Bergsten said. He
noted that that foreign investors' fears have been cited as a
primary cause for the ``Black Monday'' stock-market plunge of
October 1987.
   Without a concerted effort to get the budget under control,
Bergsten forecast ``a sharp fall in the dollar _ as much as 20
percent to 25 percent. Inflation, double-digit interest rates.
Recession.''
   Bergsten said foreigners are likely to turn pessimistic quickly
if deficit reduction is not made a primary goal during the
traditional honeymoon period when an administration's powers of
political persuasion with Congress are usually highest.
   ``By Easter (March 26) we'll be well on a good road _ or in the
soup,'' said Bergsten, a former assistant Treasury secretary for
international finance during the Carter administration.
   The institute said that in addition to eliminating the federal
budget deficit, the new administration must step up efforts to
encourage other major countries to buy more U.S. exports and develop
ways to improve America's competitiveness.
   One primary worry with the budget deficit is that it has begun
rising again. After falling sharply in 1987 because of a one-time
windfall in revenues from tax reform, the deficit for the fiscal
year which ended on Sept. 30 climbed to $155.1 billion and many
economists are predicting this year's deficit could top $160 billion.
   President Reagan and the rest of the Cabinet were presented with
the glum news Thursday that the estimated deficit for the 1990
fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, has climbed to $132 billion.
That is up from an estimate of $111 billion made by the
administration's Office of Management and Budget just three months
ago.
   Since the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law sets a deficit target
of $100 billion, that means the administration will have to come up
with $32 billion in spending cuts to meet the target or face the
prospect of raising taxes.
   OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay said that there was no intention in
Reagan's last budget to propose a tax increase or cuts in Social
Security.
   ``We have some difficult choices ahead'' on where to cut
spending, she said.
   OMB Director Joseph Wright stressed the need for quick review of
this year's budget submission in order to meet a Jan. 9 deadline for
presenting it to Congress, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said in briefing reporters on the Cabinet meeting.
   With estimates on future deficits rising, many private economists
convinced that Bush will be forced to accept some type of tax
increase despite his oft-repeated opposition to new taxes during the
campaign.
   They note the public demands for the government to do more in the
fight against drugs and estimates topping $50 billion for the cost
of bailing out hundreds of insolvent savings and loans institutions
as examples of new spending pressures.
   ``The deficit problem has not been resolved and there are
enormous pressures building for increased spending,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a private forecasting firm
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Eventually Bush is going to have to back off
of his commitment'' of no new taxes.
   At his first press conference as president-elect on Wednesday,
Bush gave some appearances of flexibility on the subject of what he
would consider prohibited taxes.
   He referred to a new surtax on high-income elderly enacted this
year as a way of financing the new catastrophic health-care program
and said, ``I don't think it was'' a tax increase.
   He also refused to rule out categorically so-called revenue
enhancements, the euphemism politicians often use in referring to
increased taxes. Bush said he would have to see a definition of what
revenue enhancements were being considered before he could make a
decision.
   Also giving economists hope for resolution of the problem are
wide expectations that Bush will name Richard Darman as the new head
of the Office of Management and Budget. Darman, a long-time aide to
former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, is considered a
pragmatist who would seek to work with Congress in crafting
deficit-cutting solutions.
   Bush must soon make known his two appointments to the National
Economic Commission, the high-level advisory panel, created by
Congress to come up with a blueprint for eliminating the budget
deficit. Many believe those appointments will tell a lot about
Bush's intentions on grappling with the budget problem.

<HEAD>Chrysler Corp. Establishes Office Of The Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. established a new
office of the chairman Thursday in a move that its 64-year-old
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said was partly intended to pave the way for
a successor.
   Iacocca and a new vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald, formerly
Chrysler Motors chairman, will make up the new two-man office at the
No. 3 auto maker, the company said.
   Chrysler Motors President Bennett Bidwell will succeed Greenwald
as Chrysler Motors chairman.
   As well as making up the office of the chairman, Iacocca and
Greenwald will be joined in a three-member corporate policy
committee by Robert S. Miller, executive vice president and chief
financial officer.
   Iacocca, who turned 64 on Oct. 15, said broadening the experience
of senior executives would pave the way for an orderly succession
when he retires. He has up to three years remaining on his contract
with Chrysler.
   ``This gives our top people a chance to stretch a little,'' he
said.
   Chrysler Motors will be given a similar structure, with
management responsibilities shared by Bidwell and Chrysler Motors
President Robert A. Lutz. And Bidwell, Lutz, Greenwald and Miller
will make up an administrative committee for Chrysler Motors.
   Chrysler Motors and the Chrysler Financial Corp. and Chrysler
Technologies units will report to the Chrysler Corp. office of the
chairman. Reporting directly to Iacocca will be the offices of
corporate planning and external affairs, and personnel and
organization, the company said in a news release.
   Lutz and Bidwell had jointly held the title of president before
the reorganization.

<HEAD>GTE Tells Analysts Workforce Reductions To Total About 14,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. handed its employees more
unwelcome news Thursday, saying it expects to eliminate about 14,000
jobs in its domestic telephone operations over the next five years.
   In addition to the 7,000 jobs it announced Wednesday it would
eliminate as a result of streamlining, GTE said an equal number of
positions would be lost as a result of factors unrelated to the
streamlining program.
   ``It's really business-as-usual occurrences. As you become more
proficient and learn to do things in better ways, you have some
down-sizing,'' said Carole Barns, a spokeswoman for the
Stamford-based corporation.
   GTE executives discussed the planned cutbacks during the
company's biannual meeting with analysts at the corporation's
management development center in Norwalk.
   On the eve of the meeting, the company had announced that
restructuring of the telephone operations would reduce the size of
the workforce to a total of about 78,000 by 1992, in part through
offering early retirement incentives.
   GTE said virtually all of those reductions would come from the
ranks of the 28,000 employees in staff and headquarters management
positions.
   The company had also said additional reductions would occur as a
result of changes unrelated to restructuring, mainly cost-cutting
and new technologies. But it did not indicate the size of that
cutback until Thursday.
   The cutbacks will not be limited to staff positions, as are the
reductions that will result from restructuring, Barns said.
   GTE had announced plans in March to streamline its telephone
operations to continue improving the quality of service and to
become faster, more flexible and responsive to customer requirements.
   The streamlining involves the folding of seven GTE operating
companies into four units and shifting of the telephone business
headquarters from Stamford to a site in either California, Texas,
Indiana or Florida. The site will be named later this month.
   GTE Corp. employs about 161,000 people in 44 states and 38
foreign countries. It reported earnings of $313 million on sales of
$4 billion during the quarter that ended Sept. 30, after a $55
million charge related to its reorganization.

<HEAD>Pepperell Seeks To Block Farley Offer; Farley Says Law
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Thursday he could rule by
Monday on some of the issues raised by lawsuits in Farley Inc.'s
attempted $1.4 billion hostile takeover of West-Point Pepperell Inc.
   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell heard arguments from
attorneys for Pepperell, which has asked the court to block Farley's
$48 a share tender offer as illegal, and for Farley, which wants
Georgia's new anti-takeover law declared unconstitutional.
   Pepperell claims the offer by Farley, which controls 9.8 percent
of Pepperell's stock, includes too much debt and not enough equity
in violation of Federal Reserve margin regulations. It also contends
that by participating in the deal, Farley's financial adviser,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is violating a standstill agreement it
made earlier this year with Pepperell.
   Pepperell has asked Tidwell for a preliminary injunction blocking
the offer.
   Farley claims Georgia's anti-takeover law hinders interstate
commerce via provisions allowing ``poison pill'' takeover defenses
and others forcing a hostile suitor to purchase 90 percent of
outstanding stock except in certain instances.
   Pepperell became the nation's largest publicly-owned textile
company earlier this year after it acquired the bed and bath
operations of J.P. Stevens & Co. Inc.
   The transaction forms the basis for much of Pepperell's attempt
to block the tender offer by Chicago-based Farley, whose
subsidiaries include the manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear.
   Pepperell's claims involving Drexel stem from the firm's role as
financial adviser to Odyssey Partners in its battle with Pepperell
over Stevens.
   The two sides eventually agreed to split Stevens holdings between
them. During negotiations leading to that arrangement, Odyssey
agreed not to share confidential information received as part of the
bidding process and agreed not to try to acquire parts of Stevens
until after March 3, 1989.
   The agreement stipulated that any of Odyssey's advisers agree to
the same restrictions before being given access to any of the
information.
   Pepperell attorney Bob Thornton argued that Drexel was bound by
those requirements, even though it did not sign the agreement.
   Drexel attorney Larry Silverman, contended the agreement was
dissolved by subsequent merger agreements between Stevens and
Odyssey. Silverman also said Drexel set up a ``Chinese wall'' so
none of the people involved in the Stevens deal participate in the
Farley offer.
   Farley attorney Steve Greiner attacked Georgia's anti-takeover
statute, which was passed this year. The law is patterned after a
Delaware takeover statute that has been upheld, but which has
slightly different provisions.
   It allows companies to adopt takeover defenses that make it
prohibitively expensive to undertake a hostile buyout. The law also
says a suitor that does not acquire 90 percent of a target company's
outstanding stock may not complete the takeover for five years.

   Hoechst Celanese Corp. said Thursday that
its third quarter net earnings were up by 37.8 percent from the same
period last year.
   The company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of West Germany's Hoechst
AG, posted a profit of $62 million in the quarter, up from $45
million for the same period last year.
   Hoechst does not trade Hoechst Celanese stock in the United
States.
   Third quarter net sales were $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3
billion for the same period in 1987.
   Nine-month net earnings were $222 million on sales of $4.1
billion. Comparison figures for 1987 were not available because the
company was formed in February 1987, when Hoechst acquired the
former Celanese Corp.
   Hoechst Celanese produces a wide variety of products including
chemicals, fibers and film, and agricultural and animal-health
products.

<HEAD>Christie Hefner Elected Chairman, CEO; Company Returning To Free
TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice chairman Christie Hefner was elected chairman
and chief executive officer of Playboy Enterprises Inc. on Thursday,
one day after the company revealed plans for a new half-hour nightly
show on free television.
   Ms. Hefner, 36, succeeds her father, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner,
at the helm of the Chicago-based publishing, video and merchandising
company.
   Hugh Hefner announced in September he would not seek re-election
as chairman and chief executive, and the company stated Ms. Hefner
was expected to be elected to those posts.
   She joined Playboy in 1975 as a special assistant to her father,
has been running the company's day-to-day operations since being
named president in 1982. She was named vice chairman of the board in
1986.
   Ms. Hefner has been credited with reversing the company's
early-1980s decline by selling off its unprofitable businesses and
restructuring its video and merchandising divisions.
   On Wednesday, Playboy announced plans to return to free
television with its first syndicated series since ``Playboy After
Dark'' went off the air in 1970.
   The new show, to be called ``After Hours,'' will be offered to
television stations around the country in fall 1989, according to
Allan Schwartz, vice president of Playboy's video entertainment
group.
   The video division, which produces adult programs for the
company's 6-year-old Playboy Channel on cable television, has formed
a unit called Alta Loma Productions to produce ``After Hours,''
Schwartz said.
   He said Alta Loma also might try its hand at mainstream fare,
possibly including a children's show, for broadcast or cable
television.
   He said ``After Hours'' will have a magazine format, with
segments of comedy and music. The show's host will be a
never-fully-seen director who will cue segments from the studio
control room.
   The ghost of a host is a departure from the prominent role
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner played on ``Playboy After Dark,'' which
appeared for two seasons.
   On that show, Hefner was the host of a party, chatting with
celebrity guests and entertainers on a set that looked like a living
room and den.
   Playboy's return to regular television comes as it is trying to
revive the Playboy Channel on cable. The company is offering some
R-rated programs in that effort.

<HEAD>Fulbright & Jaworski Merges With Reavis & McGrath Law Firm</HEAD>

   Fulbright & Jaworski will join forces with New
York-based Reavis & McGrath in what is believed to be the nation's
largest law firm merger, the firm said Thursday.
   The merged law firm will have a total of 581 attorneys, 476 from
Houston-based Fulbright and 105 from Reavis, Gibson Gayle Jr.,
Fulbright's managing partner, said.
   ``I think we will be the sixth or seventh largest law firm in the
nation,'' Gayle said. ``But I understand it's the largest merger of
a law firm.''
   Besides Houston, Fulbright has other Texas offices in Dallas, San
Antonio and Austin. The firm, which was founded in 1919, also has
offices in Washington, London and Zurich.
   Reavis, established in 1935, has 80 attorneys in New York City
and 25 in Los Angeles. Gayle said the merger will give Fulbright a
much needed presence in those cities.
   The new firm will be known as Fulbright & Jaworski, although its
New York and Los Angeles offices will initially be called Fulbright
Jaworski & Reavis McGrath.
   Gayle said Reavis's strength is in corporate, securities and
venture capital law. Fulbright, he said, is a full service law firm.
   ``We think (the merger) will improve both existing firms,'' he
said. ``I think we will find it to be a huge success.''
   Several Fulbright & Jaworski attorneys will move to New York and
Los Angeles, and it is possible some Reavis attorneys will re-locate
to Fulbright offices, he said. The merger is scheduled to be
completed Jan. 1.
