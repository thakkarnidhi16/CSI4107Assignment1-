   A 15-year-old girl whose disappearance in
mid-June led to a search by hundreds of volunteers, was remembered
at her memorial service Sunday as a precious child.
   Mourners filled the main hall of the Seaside Civic and
Convention Center for services honoring slaying victim Dorene
Raterman of Gearhart.
   In a prayer to God, the Rev. Bill Walker of Seaside Baptist
Church said, ``We need to hear from you. We need to feel your great
arm of love and strength right now.''
   ``You're the only one who can make sense right now out of this
loss and hurt,'' he said.
   The teen-ager vanished June 15 after leaving her parents a note
saying she was taking a bicycle ride to a beach half a mile from
her home. Her remains were found July 25 in a brushy area about 16
miles east of Astoria, on the state's northwest coast.
   Anthony Mullins, 20, was charged with murder and kidnapping, and
Tiac C. Eastman, 25, was charged with hindering prosecution.
   Walker told the memorial gathering of more than 1,000 people
that Doreen was a ``precious child.'' ``Happy, friendly, loving, a
joy to her parents, a blessing from God. She was Daddy's little
girl.''

   While the United States suffered through record
drought and heat, Britain slogged through its wettest July in 52
years.
   Soaked by downpours and chilled in sub-normal temperatures,
tourists spent vacations in raincoats. Homeowners struggled to keep
up with the backyard jungle growth.
   And rain forced the postponement of the men's tennis finals at
Wimbledon and the last day of the British Open golf championship.
   Scotland had the worst of the downpours. Average rainfall there
was the heaviest since modern records began, well over a century
ago in 1869, the nation's Meteorological Office said Sunday.
   Fort William in the Highlands had 12 inches. Glasgow was only
half as wet, with 6 inches.
   England and Wales had the wettest July since 1936, the office
said. The mercury rose to its highest _ 77 degress _ at Margate at
a time of year when temperatures in the 80s are not uncommon.
   Highest overall rainfall totals for Britain were in the central
lowlands of Scotland, which had between 2{ and 3 times the normal
July rainfall.
   In England, Manchester had 5{ inches of rain, Birmingham 4
inches, and London 2{ inches. In the center of the capital it had
on Sunday rained, at least a bit, every day since July 18.
   Nationwide, average temperatures for the month were below normal
everywhere, the weather department said.

   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was
``vastly improved'' and giving the thumbs-up sign to her hospital
nurse Sunday following a near-drowning in her swimming pool.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said Dr. William J. Deaton, a lung specialist treating Ms.
Jordan.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' Deaton
said. ``She is vastly improved.''
   Ms. Jordan's condition was upgraded from critical to serious but
stable, and she continued to improve Sunday night.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman Kari Larsen said.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, who gained national attention during the Nixon
impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter to
Brackenridge Hospital on Saturday after she was found floating
face-down in her pool.
   Deaton said she came within ``four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   Ms. Jordan apparently lost consciousness while in the pool.
Deaton and Dr. James Little, a neurologist, said it isn't known
what caused her to lose consciousness, but that the lack of oxygen
then caused cardiac arrest.
   Ms. Jordan had been in critical condition in the hospital's
intensive care unit, but Deaton said Sunday afternoon that ``she's
upgraded now. She's certainly stable, in a much less serious
condition.''
   Ms. Jordan was breathing without the aid of a mechanical
ventilator, responding to questions and trying to make sure a
Monday dental appointment was canceled. ``She obviously has pretty
good mental recall if that's her biggest concern,'' Deaton said.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' Little said. ``She's very close to normal
right now. I think she will continue to improve. As best as I can
tell right now, she probably will regain full mental functions.''
   The doctors said Ms. Jordan, who has used a wheelchair for
several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis but her condition
shouldn't have had an effect on the incident.
   ``She has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' Deaton said.
   Little said possible causes for her losing consciousness were a
sudden heartbeat irregularity or a seizure. But hospital tests
showed ``her cardiac status has been very stable. She's had no
evidence of seizure activity,'' he said.
   Ms. Jordan delivered a nominating speech for vice presidential
candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. Bentsen telephoned a message to Ms. Jordan
on Sunday, said hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Hinckley Boyle.
   Visitors to the hospital have included Texas Treasurer Ann
Richards, who delivered the keynote address at the convention; Walt
Rostow, a former aide to President Lyndon Johnson; University of
Texas women's basketball Coach Jody Conradt; plus Ms. Jordan's two
sisters and live-in companion, Nancy Earl, who found Ms. Jordan in
the pool.
   Ms. Jordan is a fan of the University of Texas' Lady Longhorns,
and nurse Barbara Tucker said the basketball team's former star,
Fran Harris, visited before leaving for the Olympic trials.
   ``When I remember seeing Ms. Jordan on TV, I frequently remember
the thumbs-up sign that things are OK. She's probably given me that
about 20 times today,'' Ms. Tucker said.
   Ms. Jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University
of Texas.

   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan remained in
critical condition early Sunday after she was found floating
unconscious in her swimming pool, authorities said.
   ``She's been awake off and on through the night, but she goes
right to sleep,'' said Sheryln Gembol, a nursing supervisor at
Brackenridge Hospital. ``We're trying to let her rest.
   ``They're going to be running some more tests throughout the day
today. They know it was not a heart attack or a stroke, but as far
as what made her unconscious in the pool, they're not sure,'' she
added.
   Ms. Jordan, who rose to fame during the Watergate impeachment
hearings, was found in the pool about noon Saturday by a woman who
lives with her.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
Paramedics ``said she had a pulse, was trying to breathe and they
were able to help her breathe en route to hospital,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Carolyn Boyle.
   At a briefing late Saturday, a doctor said Ms. Jordan was being
treated for fluid in her lungs but showed no signs of heart or
brain dysfunction.
   ``She has full recovery of her intellectual functions. Her vital
signs are much better,'' Dr. William Deaton said. Though she
remained in critical condition, ``the capital `c' is not so big as
when she got here.''
   ``She has to heal her own lungs, which she will hopefully do,''
added Deaton, a lung specialist. He said Ms. Jordan apparently lost
consciousness while swimming alone in the pool, for unknown
reasons. A lack of oxygen then caused the cardiac arrest, he said.
   Ms. Jordan has had medical problems for several years and has
used a wheelchair to get to her job on the faculty of the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.
   Ms. Jordan has refused to discuss the illness, calling it ``a
mobility problem'' and denying it was Lou Gehrig's disease or bone
cancer. Deaton described it as a progressive loss of ``nerve
function in her lower extremities'' similar to multiple sclerosis.
   In 1966, Ms. Jordan became the first black state senator in
Texas. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction.
   She gained a national reputation during the House Judiciary
Committee's 1974 hearings that ended with a vote to press
impeachment charges against President Richard Nixon. She stirred
television audiences when she declared, ``My faith in the
Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total.''

<HEAD>Official: Iran to Stop Attacks on Shipping During Cease-Fire Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOHA, Qatar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Iranian envoy indicated that Iran
would stop attacking commercial ships in the Persian Gulf while his
country and Iraq try to negotiate a cease-fire in their 8-year-old
war.
   The envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Ahmed Besharati, also
said he expected U.S. protection of Kuwaiti tankers to end soon,
and that Iran is ready to use its influence for the release of
foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   Besharati is on a tour of the Arab Persian Gulf nations to
assure them of Tehran's intention to abide by a U.N. resolution
calling for a cease-fire. He spoke to reporters in Abu Dhabi on
Saturday before continuing to Qatar.
   ``We will try to do our best not to violate anything ... so that
resolution 598 will become a reality,'' Besharati said when asked
if Iran would continue to attack neutral shipping in the Persian
Gulf.
   Besharati said now that cease-fire talks are being held at the
United Nations, he expected ``the American flag to come down from
the Kuwaiti tankers soon.'' He also said he believed the United
States would stop providing naval escort for Kuwaiti tankers in the
gulf. The tankers have been flying the U.S. flag for one year to
qualify for protection against Iranian attacks.
   Iranian and Iraqi representatives are holding separate talks
with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York to
arrange a cease-fire.
   Asked about U.S. hostages in Lebanon, Besharati said:
   ``So far, no Western country has negotiated the hostage issue
with us. If they did so, we promise to use all our influence to
release them.''
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held
hostage by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament and
commander-in-chief, said last week that his country would be
prepared to use its influence in efforts to free the hostages if
President Reagan released Iranian assets frozen since 1979. The
White House rejected the offer.

   A pier holding thousands of people
collapsed in northwestern Malaysia on Sunday, killing at least 30
people and injuring 400, official Radio Television Malaysia
reported.
   In an earlier report, the national news agency Bernama said at
least 21 people died and more than 150 were injured. It was not
immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting casualty figures.
   The people on the pier were waiting for a ferry to take them to
nearby Penang island in the Strait of Malacca when the pier
collapsed in Butterworth, 190 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur, the
news agency said.
   Firemen and Penang Port Commission workers were clearing the
debris and searching for more bodies, Bernama said. A stream of
cars, motorcycles, taxis and vans carried the injured to the
district hospital in Butterworth and private clinics in the area,
the news agency said.
   It said people with broken hands and legs and or bleeding
profusely from the head were lying along the corridors of the
hospital.
   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, Transport Minister Ling
Liong Sik said an inquiry would be held into the incident.

   The Royal Air Force rescued 22
birdwatchers who ran out of food after bad weather stranded them on
a small island, officials said.
   Two air force helicopters picked up the group Saturday afternoon
and took them to the coastal town of Pwllheli, according to a
Ministry of Defense spokesman.
   The birdwatchers had been stranded on Bardsey, a tiny island two
miles off the northern coast of Wales, according to an LBC radio
report.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman said the birdwatchers had planned
to leave the island a week ago.
   ``Because of the sea state, the high winds, they hadn't been
able to get a boat across either to get them off or to supply them
with food,'' Royal Air Force Lt. Steve Murkin told the radio
station.
   ``They'd run out of food so they were rather desperate to get
back,'' Murkin said.

   A series of undersea earthquakes Sunday shook the
Pacific coastline of the Izu Peninsula, the Central Meteorological

   Officials reported no damage or injuries from the quakes, which
measured up to 5.4 on the Richter scale.
   A total of 73 quakes shook Izu since Tuesday, with at least 64
recorded on Sunday morning, according to the agency.
   The strongest one, which occurred Sunday at 8:40 a.m. near the
Izu coastal town of Ajiro, was felt in Tokyo 60 miles to the
southwest.
   In 1978, an earthquake measuring 7 on Richter scale shook the
Isu area and killed 27 people.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.

   Three bombs exploded Sunday in the
northern province of Alto Adige, injuring one person and damaging
about 30 cars, police said. Authorities blamed the blasts on
German-speaking extremists seeking autonomy for the province.
   Thirteen bombs attributed to the extremists have gone off since
March, but none have caused deaths or serious injuries.
   Police said one bomb exploded in a garbage bin in the city of
Bolzano at about 4:30 a.m., injuring a 65-year-old man who was cut
by flying glass. Windows and cars were also damaged, they said.
   At about the same time, two bombs exploded at a hydroelectric
plant in Ponte Gardena, about 10 miles north of Bolzano. One of the
plant's three power transformers was heavily damaged by one
explosion and a resulting fire, police said.
   State-owned RAI television said about $750,000 in damage was
done to the plant owned by Selm, a subsidiary of the chemical
company Montedison.
   A second bomb exploded in a field about 100 yards from the
houses of eight Italian-speaking plant workers, but caused no
serious damage.
   On the plant's gates, investigators found an envelope on which
was scrawled in German ``United Tyrol Combat Group,'' a name left
at other bomb sites. German inhabitants refer to the province as
South Tyrol.
   The Alto Adige province was stripped from Austria after World
War I. The 300,000 ethnic German-speakers are a majority and have
demanded priority in government jobs and more control over local
broadcasting. Extremists want an independent Tyrolian state.
   After a terrorism campaign in the 1960s, the Italian government
made the province officially bilingual.

   An independent mining commission
threatened to call a strike at a copper mine in southwestern Poland
if management does not improve safety conditions by Aug. 15, an
opposition spokesman said Sunday.
   ``Working conditions there are disastrous,'' said Marek
Jakubiec, a member of Solidarity's Law Observance Commission.
Jakubiec said that men are working in noxious conditions and are
entitled to special bonuses, but he said the company won't pay them
more because it would bankrupt the mine.
   The mine is in the town of Rudna.
   The commission was created July 20 to force management to adhere
to promises made May 3 during a strike at the mine.
   Jakubiec said a recent study showed that temperatures in the
mine reach 97 degrees, while official industry rules say work
should not proceed at temperatures exceeding 82 degrees.
   The mine has 6,000 workers.
   Meanwhile, in the port city of Gdansk, church and opposition
sources said several hundred people gathered in front of St.
Brygida's church and marched to the nearby train station in support
of the banned Solidarity trade union federation.
   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' and ``We want
Lech,'' they shouted, referring to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Police watched but did not intervene, and the crowd dispersed
quietly at the railway station. There were no immediate reports of
arrests.

   The first VISA and MasterCard credit cards
ever issued by Soviet banks have gone to the head of the Soviet
Union's National Olympic Committee and a Moscow banking executive.
   The first VISA card, called ``SovCard,'' was issued Friday to
Yuri Titov by VAO Intourist in Moscow, which is responsible in the
Soviet Union for foreign travel, said Dan Brigham, a spokesman for
Visa International in San Francisco.
   Titov said in a prepared statement released by VISA that he has
declared VISA the ``official credit card'' of the 1988 Soviet
Olympic Team.
   An Intourist spokesman predicted that SovCards soon will be
avilable to the general Soviet population.
   On Saturday, MasterCard International issued a
Eurocard-MasterCard in Moscow to Yu S. Moskovsky, chairman of the
USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs, known as Vnesheconombank,
said MasterCard spokesman Howard Pulchin in New York.
   A 75-second MasterCard commercial is scheduled to air Monday
during the popular Soviet news program Vremya, Pulchin said. The
so-called ``Gold Card'' eventually will be widely available in the
Soviet Union, he said.
   The credit limits of the cards and other policies governing
their use were not immediately available.
   The government agency Intourist joined Visa as a card-issuing
member in January. It issued the card through Sberegatelnybank, a
Soviet bank with sole responsibility for consumer banking, Brigham
said.
   Mikhail Misko, director of Intourist's credit card program, said
in the statement, that he is working with Okobank, the Finnish
cooperative bank, to ``establish the systems necessary for our Visa
card to be accepted worldwide.''

<TEXT>
   Complaints from the humane society prompted a
radio station to change the rules in a scavenger hunt in which
contestants were to bring in kittens as a tie-breaker for the
$1,000 prize.
   Participants deadlocked at the end of the regular contest would
have received one point for every kitten they took to a shopping
mall.
   Rhonda Poe, who operates the Selma Humane Society, said she was
concerned for the safety of any kitten being used in the contest.
   ``We've been getting calls all day from people who want kittens,
but we're afraid they only want them to win some money and will get
rid of them when the contest is over,'' she said.
   Ed Davies, operations manager at WTUN-FM, said using kittens as
a tie-breaker ``seemed like a cute idea.'' But the station decided
against it ``after being told they might not be treated properly.''
   Instead of collecting kittens, Davies said the names of two

<TEXT>
   One of two men accused of trying to rob a
couple in their apartment had his ear bitten off in a struggle that
followed the foiled robbery, police said.
   Two men on Saturday knocked on the door of the apartment shared
by Columbus Neal and Nikki Hernandez, forced their way in and
demanded money, said Lt. Frank Galbrecht of the Olathe Police
Department.
   One intruder was armed with a knife and the other with a
shotgun, Galbrecht said.
   While the would-be robbers were inside, Neal's brother, Kendall
Neal, and another friend arrived at the apartment to visit. When
the two guests heard a commotion inside the apartment, they burst
in and attacked the intruders, Galbrecht said.
   Columbus Neal joined the struggle and bit off the right ear of
one of the intruders before the men fled, Galbrecht said.
   The 34-year-old man was arrested when he went to an Olathe
hospital to seek treatment. Galbrecht said a police officer took
the severed ear to the hospital, where it was sewn back on. A
25-year-old suspect also was arrested near the apartment complex
about the same time.

<HEAD>Activists Demonstrate Outside Theater Screening `Monkey Shines'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen wheelchair users demonstrated outside
a Hollywood theater screening a new horror film, ``Monkey Shines,''
which the activists claim portrays the disabled as bitter, evil
murderers.
   ``We're tired of the wheelchair school of horror in Hollywood,''
said Bill Bolte, founder of ADAPT-Cal, a disabled rights group that
organized the protest Saturday.
   ``It was filled with inaccuracies and out-and-out lies about
handicapped people,'' said Bolte, 57, a quadriplegic who was
afflicted with polio as a child and has been in a wheelchair for
the last 12 years.
   ``Monkey Shines,'' an Orion Pictures production which opened
Friday, is about a quadriplegic who uses a monkey trained to help
severely disabled people to murder his ex-girlfriend, his doctor,
his mother, his best friend and his nurse.
   ``The central insult is that it's another picture showing
disabled people as ``bitter, angry cripples and murderers,'' Bolte
said.
   Twelve protestors in wheelchairs carried signs and demonstrated
for three hours in front of the Hollywood Pacific Theater, trying
to persuade moviegoers to boycott the film.
   One of the hand-made signs read: ``What next Orion: Attack of
the killer seeing-eye dogs!''
   ``I really didn't pay attention to them,'' said R. Fernandez,
assistant manager of the theater. ``They talked to some patrons but
they didn't disturb them.''

<HEAD>Summary of Week's Economic Indicators</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Inflation Fears, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The economic news last week was mostly positive. But the word on
inflation was worrying to many. Here is a brief recap:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GNP</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the second quarter, the gross national product expanded at a
3.1 percent annual pace, down slightly from a revised 3.4 percent
in the first three months of the year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INFLATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, climbed
at a 4.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter, the biggest
advance since 1982. The index rose at a 3.5 percent rate in the
first quarter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONSUMER SPENDING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending in June rose a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent
to $3.21 trillion, following a 0.6 percent increase in May. It was
the biggest increase since spending shot up 1.3 percent last August.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERSONAL INCOME AND SAVINGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income jumped 0.7 percent in June, the best
showing in three months. The $27.9 billion increase to $4.04
trillion followed a 0.5 percent rise in May.
   The personal savings rate fell to 4.3 percent, compared with 4.4
percent in May. The average savings rate for the first half of
1988, 4.1 percent, is up substantially from 3.2 percent in 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IMPORT PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Import prices rose 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the
biggest increase in more than a year.
   The climb followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March
period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first
three months of 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAGE INCREASES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Major collective bargaining settlements in private industry
during the first six months of this year provided for wage
increases averaging 2.2 percent a year.
   This was a slight decline from the 2.9 percent average wage
increases in the contracts when they were negotiated two to three
years ago.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FACTORY ORDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Factory orders for durable goods advanced 8.8 percent in June,
their fastest pace in 30 months. Orders totaled $125.23 billion,
$10.14 billion higher than the May total.
   The June increase, which followed a 1.9 percent decline in May,
was the biggest advance since an 8.9 percent jump in December 1985.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investment in the United States has jumped by more than
215 percent since 1980, while American investment abroad increased
by only one-fifth that rate, said a study by the Congressional
Economic Leadership Institute.
   The study said the pace is expected to accelerate, with foreign
buyouts in 1988 expected to make up as much as 20 percent of all
U.S. acquisitions, up from 5 percent in 1987. But the report said
foreign investments still account for only 5 percent to 6 percent
of total U.S. assets.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 67.74 points
during the week, finishing with a 46.40-point rise Friday.
   Analysts attributed the advance to fresh strength in the dollar
and favorable reaction to indications by Chairman Alan Greenspan
that the Federal Reserve has not changed credit policy recently.

<HEAD>TV Station Inadvertantly Runs Part Of Old Carter Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of puzzled television viewers called a
newspaper after seeing 15 seconds of a commercial spot from Jimmy
Carter's 1976 presidential campaign during the ``Wheel of Fortune.''
   ``It was there as plain as the nose on your face,'' said Jim
Estep of Akron. ``Carter was standing in front of his house in
Plains, Ga., and there was a 1976 copyright (on the tape).''
   The Carter spot aired at 7:20 p.m. Wednesday over station WEWS
in Cleveland during a broadcast of the popular game show, a
secretary at the station said Friday.
   The Akron Beacon Journal reported that dozens of viewers called
the newspaper saying they had seen the ad.
   Dorothy Fay of Stow said she and her daughter, Mary Banks, had
just returned from grocery shopping when they saw the spot.
   ``My daughter had bought a couple of lottery tickets, so we
turned on the TV to catch the lottery numbers and there it (the
Carter commercial) was. My daughter said, `What's going on here? Is
he going to run again?'''
   A secretary for WEWS Programming Director Gary Stark, whom the
Beacon Journal did not identify, told the newspaper that another
commercial had been taped over the Carter commercial.
   ``It (the Carter commercial) was supposed to have been erased,''
she said. But the final 15-second segment of the Carter spot was
accidentally left intact.

   Eleven more people died Sunday from
diseases blamed on flooding in New Delhi, health authorities said.
   The deaths brought to 212 the number of residents killed by
cholera and gastroenteritis in the Indian capital since the
beginning of July, when heavy monsoon rains hit New Delhi.
   Officials blamed the diseases on flood waters that have washed
through sewage and uncollected garbage and infiltrated drinking
water.
   Hospitals admitted at least 231 people suffering from the
diseases Sunday, including 38 people with cholera, raising to 624
the number of reported cholera cases in this city of 8 million,
health officials said.
   More than 16,000 patients have sought treatment for the two
diseases in July, according to official figures.
   The areas hardest-hit by the epidemic are slums, where garbage
has not been collected for months because of a dispute over which
municipal agencies are responsible.

   An explosion and fire apparently caused by a bomb
Sunday destroyed the offices of the left-leaning monthly Globe, and
a firefighter was injured, police said.
   The exact cause of the blast in the central Opera district of
the capital was not expected to be revealed until Monday, but
employees of the magazine and the French TV station TF1 said it was
a bomb.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast. Georges-Marc
Benamou, director of the magazine, said that ``for the past 2{
years, we've received threats from racist organizations.''
   Police said the explosion occurred at 3:30 a.m. in the
second-floor offices of the Globe. No one was in the offices at the
time.
   About 30 people were evacuated as the fire began spreading to
apartments in the seven-story building, and a firefighter was
injured, police said. The firefighter's condition was not
immediately known.
   ``The door was forced open, a bomb was place in the newsroom,
the doors and windows were blown out,'' an unidentified Globe
employee was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse, the French
news agency. ``All the archives, the new layout, were destroyed.''
   In a telegram to Globe employees, Culture and Communications
Minister Jack Lang called the blast an ``act of barbarism and
hate.''
   ``Liberty of expression ... will be firmly protected by the
government,'' the telegram said.
   The slick Parisian magazine, which started publication in
November 1985, says it is geared to 20- to 40-year-olds who like
both ``glamour'' and politics. It is known for its pro-Israeli
sympathies.
   During presidential elections in May, the magazine contributed
to the spectacular rise in popularity of Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand with a glowing issue devoted to the chief of
state. Mitterrand was re-elected to a seven-year term May 8.

   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton has gone
from the media doghouse to media darling in one short week. And all
it took was a smile, a few self-deprecating jokes and a song.
   Clinton, panned for a Democratic convention speech that seemed
like the last word in boredom when he nominated Michael Dukakis for
president, has apparently made a comeback with his appearance
Thursday with Johnny Carson on ``The Tonight Show.''
   Cable News Network on Friday cited the governor for the
``fastest turnaround ever'' on its weekly ``Winners and Losers.''
   Clinton, considered a rising political star, had been the big
loser the previous week for his July 20 speech. ``Clinton proved
that being a good sport is the first step to political
rehabilitation,'' said Frederick Allen, a CNN political analyst.
   Clinton traded quips with Carson and confided that his 35-minute
nomination speech, which was interrupted by chants and less polite
suggestions that he stop, was actually designed to make Dukakis
look good.
   He also took a turn on the saxophone, doing a passable rendition
of ``Summertime'' with Doc Severinson and the NBC Orchestra.
   ``People who watch television love this kind of comeback story.
He was so boyish and charming. I'm sure he won a lot of hearts,''
said Tom Shales, syndicated television critic for The Washington
Post.
   E.J. Dionne, national political writer for The New York Times,
said, ``It may well be that Clinton had a bigger audience on Johnny
Carson than he had at the convention.''
   Not everybody was watching, though. Dukakis missed the
broadcast, but Mark Gearan, Dukakis' press secretary, said he did
get favorable reports.
   ``It came as no surprise to him that Gov. Clinton went out of
the ballpark,'' Gearan said.

   Trust a Knievel to want to jump just a
little farther.
   Robbie Knievel, son of stunt legend Evel Knievel, sailed over 22
cars on his motorcycle, let go of the handlebars for a blink and
landed more than halfway down a 100-foot ramp. By his own estimate,
it was about a 26-car sail.
   ``My gap here was about 140 feet,'' Knievel said after the jump
Saturday at Portland International Raceway. ``I might have gone
about 170 feet. Actually, I wanted to clear the whole ramp.''
   Knievel teased the crowd with three practice passes at the
takeoff ramp, climbed it once slowly for a last look, then
retreated. After a pause for effect, he gunned his dirt bike for
the takeoff.
   Knievel guessed that he was going about 75 mph when he hit the
ramp.
   ``Usually you know about halfway across whether you're going to
make it or not, and about then I knew I was going to be all
right,'' he said. ``But I thought I was getting back too far, and I
didn't want to flip over. That's why I only let go for a little
bit.''
   Evel Knievel, who suffered a total of 35 broken bones during his
daredevil career, said he had never cleared more than 21 cars
during his career. He says his son is a far better jumper than he
ever was.
   ``It felt really good,'' Robbie Knievel said.

   Willie Nelson, picketed by police because
of a benefit concert he gave for a man convicted of killing two FBI
agents, has agreed to give a benefit for both American Indian and
police causes.
   The country music star's concert Friday was picketed by more
than 400 Rhode Island police and their supporters, but there were
no picket lines at Saturday's show after Nelson made his
announcement.
   Police had charged that Nelson supports ``cop killers'' because
of a benefit last year for Leonard Peltier, an Indian serving two
life sentences for killing two FBI agents in South Dakota in 1975.
   ``For many years, there's been hard feelings'' between Indians
and police, Nelson said. ``If this is the first way to ease hard
feelings, then I'm happy to be a part of it.''
   ``By this agreement, he's sending a message to every law
enforcement officer,'' Richard Patterson, president of the
Providence Fraternal Order of Poice, said Saturday.
   The joint benefit will be held Aug. 23 in Springfield, Mass.,
with proceeds going to the American Indian Relief Fund and the
National Police Memorial Fund.

   The only sign marking the office at the
U.S. Courthouse here is a room number scratched in black pen above
a door frame.
   Inside, there are no plaques, no citations, no personal
photographs of a man once described as a more powerful influence on
the law than President Reagan or Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   ``Very few people find me over here, which I regard as a plus,''
says Lewis F. Powell, who retired from the U.S. Supreme Court one
year ago.
   Powell was often seen during the 1980s as the justice who kept
the court from drifting too far left or right. But he takes a
modest view of his role.
   ``If I got into a footnote, I'd be surprised,'' Powell said.
   Although he cited age and declining health when he retired, he's
maintaining a full schedule.
   ``His idea of retirement is to stop working at 4 o'clock on
Saturday afternoon,'' said Robert R. Merhige Jr., a U.S. district
judge and longtime friend.
   Since he ``retired,'' Powell has sat with appellate court
panels, taught at the University of Virginia and delivered
commencement addresses at George Mason University and Washington
and Lee.
   Powell, 80, said he has had no regrets about retirement. He and
his wife, Josephine, have four children and seven grandchildren.
   ``When you reach my ancient age, family is far more important
than any of the less personal things that happen to one over a long
lifetime,'' he said.

   Comedian Jackie Mason has asked a state appellate
court to throw out a ruling that he is the father of a 2{-year-old
girl from north Miami.
   Attorney Gerald Mager questioned the validity of the blood test
on which the paternity ruling was based, telling the 3rd District
Court of Appeal on Friday that the test could not prove positively
that he was the father.
   A judge decided in April that Mason, star of ``Caddyshack II,''
is the father of Ginger Reiter's daughter. The judge said the child
``looks like'' Mason and said other evidence and testimony made it
evident that he is the father.
   A blood test showed Mason's probability of being the father was
99.94 percent, according to court records. The judge ordered Mason
to pay child support of $1,500-a-month. The appeals court gave no
indication when it would rule.

   India's most popular television program,
the serialization of a Hindu epic that was canceled despite
protests and strikes by viewers, will return to the air, the
government said Sunday.
   The announcement was made on government television just after
what was to have been the 78th and final episode of the serial
``Ramayana.'' No date for broadcasting further programs was given
in the announcement.
   The show's producer, Ramanand Sagar, told Press Trust of India
that it would take until at least November to tape more episodes.
   About 100 million of India's 800 million people watched the
half-hour show each Sunday, many on communal sets in small villages.
   The 2,600-year-old epic tells the story of the warrior-king
Rama, an incarnation of a major Hindu god, Vishnu. In Sunday's
program, he returned to be crowned king after 14 years in exile.
   However, the traditional story goes on to tell of the banishment
of Rama's wife, Sita, the birth of her twins Luv and Kush, and her
being swallowed up by Earth as the youngsters are reunited with
Rama.
   The program was orignally scheduled to run for 52 weeks, but it
was extended to 78 weeks because of protests from people who did
not want it to end.
   In Hindu-dominated North India, garbage collectors went on
strike in three cities to demand the show go on to tell the rest of
the epic. One union filed suit, claiming Rama was not properly
characterized in the shorter version.

   New government statistics have revived the
debate over whether the evil inflation monster, which terrorized
America during the 1970s, is starting to awaken after having slept
for most of this decade.
   The Reagan administration, mindful of how voters' perceptions
will affect the presidential race, insists there are no signs that
inflation is becoming a problem. But many private economists
disagree.
   These economists contend that the 68-month economic expansion,
now the second longest of the post-World War II period, has used up
all of the economy's slack capacity.
   Tight labor markets and high factory operating rates are
beginning to be translated into accelerating wage demands and
higher prices, they believe.
   Proponents of this theory received more ammunition last week
with two new government reports, one on wage increases and the
other on overall economic growth and inflation.
   The wage report showed that compensation for American workers,
wages and fringe benefits such as health insurance and pensions,
was rising this year at the highest rate since the summer of 1985.
Wages and benefits, which represent about two-thirds of all
business costs, climbed by 4.5 percent in the 12-month period
ending in June, compared with an increase of just 3 percent in the
prior 12 months.
   In a second report, the government said an inflation index tied
to the gross national product shot up at an annual rate of 4.7
percent from April through June, the fastest pace in almost six
years. The big jump in prices was blamed on higher consumer costs
for food, clothing and energy.
   To the administration, these reports were not cause for concern.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, blamed
the inflation spurt on temporary factors, including the drought and
higher import costs because of the weaker dollar. He insisted that
there was no evidence that the economy was being overtaken by a new
wage-price spiral.
   ``We remain convinced that inflation will continue under
restraint,'' he told reporters during a briefing.
   Some private economists agree, contending that inflationary
pressures from the drought and tight labor markets are being offset
by weakness in oil prices and a rebound in the dollar, which
reduces the costs of imports.
   They note that the consumer price index, after registering big
jumps in the early spring, calmed down in May and June only 0.3
percent. During the first six months of the year, consumer prices
rose 4.4 percent, identical to the inflation rate for all of 1987.
   ``I don't think we are seeing signs of higher inflation ahead,''
said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm. ``The
rise in energy and clothing prices in the spring has since been
reversed.''
   But this view is disputed by other private analysts, who argue
that inflation has once again become a threat for the first time
since the early 1980s, when the fight to reduce double-digit
inflation rates led to the steep 1981-82 recession.
   ``The pickup in inflation is worrisome and is likely to continue
through the end of the year, raising the possibility of a slowdown
in growth in 1989,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the
National Association of Manufacturers.
   Other analysts raise the possibility of an outright recession
beginning next year. The Federal Reserve since March has been
taking a series of steps to push interest rates higher in an effort
to ease inflationary pressures by dampening demand.
   While this is the classic recipe for starting a recession,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has maintained that a
downturn can be avoided if the central bank acts quickly at the
first sign of inflation, when the amount of credit restraint needed
is still small.
   But David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said the
Fed may have already waited too long.
   ``The pattern is that the Fed always waits too long to act, then
it clamps down too hard and causes a recession,'' he said.
   Wyss said the Fed has been hesitant about moving too quickly
because this is a presidential election year and big interest-rate
boosts would not be viewed favorably by the administration in its
efforts to keep the White House in Republican hands.
   As a result, Wyss predicted that consumer prices would rise at
around 5.5 percent annual rate next year, which would be the
fastest inflation clip since an 8.9 percent rise in 1981.
   Alan Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said one of the
problems is that demand pressures are outstripping the country's
ability to produce the goods and services.
   ``We are starting to see a situation where we have too many
dollars chasing too few goods,'' he said. ``Once the economy runs
out of slack, we often get a credit crunch, which ultimately leads
to a recession.''

<TEXT>
   Astronauts on the first
post-Challenger shuttle flight may grow crystals of a protein taken
from the AIDS virus in an experiment researchers hope will lead to
drugs to fight the fatal disease.
   The protein, reverse transcriptase, is an enzyme the AIDS virus
uses to replicate its genetic material in order to reproduce and
spread through the body, said Dr. Charles Bugg, a University of
Alabama-Birmingham researcher.
   ``AIDS would never infect human cells without using this
enzyme,'' said Bugg, coordinator for NASA of protein experiments
that are to be conducted aboard Discovery. The shuttle is scheduled
to fly later this year.
   Researchers want to grow the crystals of reverse transcriptase
to decipher its structure. Crystals grown in space are not
distorted by gravity while they form.
   Scientists hope to learn how the AIDS virus takes over the
genetic machinery inside a cell and use that knowledge to develop a
drug to conquer AIDS.
   Dr. Tom Krenitsky at Burroughs Wellcome in Research Triangle
Park, N.C., developed the experiment. NASA is making sure it meets
safety guidelines.
   ``We want to make sure there is no danger of infection to the
crew with just this protein,'' Bugg said.
   Jim Ball, a NASA spokesman in Washington, said the review would
take several weeks.
   Krenitsky predicted that if the shuttle is launched in September
and the experiment works well, researchers could have a model of
the protein's structure by the end of the year. But he cautioned it
could take 10 years to make a new AIDS drug.
   ``It's still very much an experimental program, but one that we
feel is full of promise,'' he said.
   Discovery is in the middle of a simulated countdown leading up
to a crucial test-firing of its main engines to test modifications.
The countdown was interrupted Friday because of problems with
ground fueling equipment, and the firing was postponed from Monday
until Thursday.
   NASA officials so far have found no evidence to suggest the
experiment could infect any of the astronauts with AIDS. Krenitsky
said Thursday that it even if the protein somehow got into an
astronaut's bloodstream it would not infect him.
   ``First of all, you only have one of 20 to 30 proteins the virus
needs to be a viable organism,'' Krenitsky said. ``It's such a
small piece, it's not workable.''

   Behind the arguments about various child-care
proposals, the real winners are working mothers whose problems are
getting unprecedented attention on the presidential campaign trail
and on Capitol Hill.
   Although there's no certainty that Congress will enact such
legislation this year, given the little time left on the
election-year legislative calendar, both Democrat Michael Dukakis
and Republican George Bush have latched onto the issue.
   Passage of legislation more comprehensive than the current
patchwork of federal child-care policies, therefore, seems
inevitable.
   Helen Blank, director of child care at the Children's Defense
Fund, says she couldn't be more pleased.
   ``The landscape is changing, both demographically and
politically,'' she said. ``Families need child care. They've waited
a long time to turn any attention to this issue. Clearly both
candidates have an interest ... and both candidates understand (the
need for) new, significant resources.''
   In fact, both Bush and Dukakis visited day-care centers last
week.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Bush, his
certain Republican opponent, favor rival child-care approaches, so
the issue is sure to remain in public view as the general election
campaign unfolds.
   The day-care visits seemed tacit recognition by the two men of a
new American social norm documented recently by the Census Bureau:
More than half of new mothers go back to work before their children
are a year old.
   Bush is proposing a $2.2 billion program of tax credits for
working parents, while Dukakis is backing a $2.5 billion child-care
bill in Congress.
   The obvious concern displayed by Bush and Dukakis, plus the
surprisingly high dollar commitment in Bush's proposal, are fueling
optimism that a comprehensive child-care bill may be enacted this
year.
   ``Apparently we're not arguing money anymore,'' an ebullient
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said after Bush made his proposal.
   ``We're all agreed we've got to do something about child care.
We're all agreed that it's going to cost a lot of money,'' Dodd
said.
   The Connecticut Democrat is chief sponsor of the $2.5 billion
Act for Better Child Care Services.
   Dukakis has endorsed the Democratic initiative in principle. The
legislation won Senate committee approval last week and is
tentatively scheduled for action this week in the House Education
and Labor Committee.
   The bill reserves 75 percent of its money to help low- and
middle-income parents pay for day care at homes and centers that
meet minimum federal safety and staffing standards. States could
use the rest of the money for capital improvements, day-care staff
training and salaries and administrative costs.
   The approach differs substantially from the one that Bush has
proposed. The vice president's day-care program would be built
around a tax credit of up to $1,000 for low-income families for
each child under 4 _ even if one parent in the family was staying
home to take care of the child.
   The largest existing government program is the dependent-care
tax credit for dual-earner families who pay for child care. It
costs the Department of the Treasury about $4 billion a year in
lost revenue.
   According to Blank, other government child-care programs include
a $2.7 billion social services block grant to states, of which less
than 20 percent is used for day care, and a $600 million food
program that helps day-care homes and centers provide nutritious
meals.
   Welfare parents in job training programs or jobs that don't pay
enough for them to leave the rolls are also entitled to some help
with child-care expenses.
   The Bush bill, endorsed in general terms by President Reagan,
would depart from current policy by giving tax breaks to families
with a spouse at home _ families not eligible for the existing
dependent care tax credit.
   At least four Republican-sponsored bills pending in Congress
take the same approach. Conservatives support it as a way to
eliminate what they see as tax discrimination against mothers who
decide to stay home with their children.
   But Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed tax study group,
said the bills are unfair and unlikely to help those most in need,
since low-income families can least afford to have one parent stay
at home.
   Backers of the Democratic initiative say a universal tax break
for families with preschool children is no substitute for their
bill.
   They argue that a $1,000 tax credit would pay for only a third
of the cost of one child's annual day care, and after the fact.
They say a simple tax credit does not address the uneven quality of
day care.
   Conservatives criticize the Democrats' bill on two major points
_ its cost and the federal day-care standards it sets. But Bush's
plan and a recent House GOP initiative with a $1.3 billion price
tag may blunt the controversy over spending.
   That leaves federal standards for child-care as the primary
sticking point.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., summing up the conservative view
during committee discussion of the Democratic bill, said, ``It has
not been established in my mind that state and local governments
... need to be guided by the superior wisdom from Washington.''
   Dodd and Children's Defense Fund officials say national
standards are critical.
   ``This is a linchpin'' of Dodd's bill, Blank said.
   ``Clearly this is not a regional issue,'' she said. ``Infants
have the same needs no matter what state they're located in. A
child care-giver with no training has no training no matter where
she resides.''

<HEAD>Resignation of Mafia Investigator Causes Crisis In Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of Italy's top investigator of the
Mafia has shaken public confidence in the government's battle with
the mob and prompted fears about a new wave of corruption in Sicily.
   Giovanni Falcone and eight other investigating magistrates, who
played a prominent role in Italy's largest Mafia trial, resigned
Saturday. The so-called maxi-trial ended in December with
convictions of 338 Mafiosi, including 19 reputed members of the
Cosa Nostra's leadership commission.
   The nine magistrates of the ``anti-Mafia pool'' in Sicily
submitted their resignations to the Superior Council of
Magistrates, which oversees Italian judges, and asked to be
transferred to other posts.
   Falcone gave several reasons for the action, including what he
called obstruction of Mafia investigations on the island of Sicily.
   In a letter to the council, Falcone cited ``ommissions and
inertia'' in the fight against organized crime. ``That which I
feared could happen unfortunately happened. The investigations into
the Mafia have been obstructed and (the anti-Mafia pool) ... is now
stalled.''
   Falcone also said in the letter that he wanted to leave his job
so he could testify freely before a Rome inquiry into Mafia
investigations.
   The Council of Magistrates has been holding an inquiry into
statements by the prosecutor of the Sicilian city of Marsala, Paolo
Borsellino, that state and local officials curbed the power of the
anti-Mafia group.
   Palermo's mayor said Falcone's resignation could mark a return
to the days when Sicilian authorities and politicians conspired
with the mob.
   ``We have weeded out corrupt politicians, or those who were in
some way accomplices of the Mafia,'' the mayor, Leoluca Orlando,
said in an interview with the state-run RAI television Saturday
night.
   ``Today,'' he said, ``we are worried that there can be a return
to the past, a return to the years in which magistrates, policemen
and politicians were in collusion with the Mafia. I wouldn't want
to return to the past.''
   Ten days ago, Borsellino caused a national uproar when he
charged that authorities had gone soft on the Mafia since the
``maxi-trial'' and that state and local officials had curbed the
power of the magistrates.
   The charges prompted President Francesco Cossiga to dispatch
national police officials to Palermo to examine the situation. He
also ordered the inquiry by the national judges' council in Rome.
   In his letter to the council, Falcone also said his methods
``differ radically'' with those of his new superior, Antonino Meli.
   Meli was appointed overseeing magistrate in February despite
objections by Falcone that he had no experience in Mafia probes.
   Falcone said his resignation should be seen as ``the profound
unease of one who must perform a delicate job in unfavorable
conditions and the desire to express freely my thoughts without any
conditions.''
   The anti-Mafia pool was put together in 1983, after an
investigator was killed in Palermo. The team worked under heavy
security and devoted attention to fighting the Mafia.
   The magistrates were the first to take advantage of new laws to
examine bank accounts of anyone suspected of Mafia association. The
information was used successfully in trials of suspected Mafia drug
traffickers.
   Falcone won the cooperation of Tomasso Buscetta, a Mafia leader
who broke the mob's code of silence to describe its command
structure in the 1987 trial.
   Falcone has become a national symbol of Italy's war on organized
crime and is considered its top investigator of the Mafia.

   Turkish troops shot and seriously wounded
a Greek Cypriot soldier Sunday in the fortified buffer zone that
divides this capital city, officials said.
   Greek soldiers said Sgt. Evagoras Evagorou, 19, was shot in the
back while crossing the 25-yard-wide zone in a quarter of the old
city to talk to a Turkish guard on the other side.
   The men, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.N. troops
who patrol the strip rushed Evagorou to the hospital. Cyprus state
radio said Evagorou was in critical condition after surgery for
removal of a kidney and part of the spleen.
   This was the first serious shooting incident in the buffer zone
since another Greek Cypriot soldier was shot and killed by Turkish
troops two years ago.
   The strip, patrolled by Turkish and Greek Cypriot troops, has
divided Cyprus in two since 1974, when Turkey seized the northern
part of the island.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus said in a statement that a Turkish soldier warned
Evagorou several times that he was dangerously close to the Turkish
position.
   The statement said the Turkish guard shouted ``stop'' three
times in Greek and then fired once into the air, in accordance with
military regulations, before shooting and wounding Evagorou from
about four yards away.

   Tennessee eagle No. 3
looked glum.
   In just two hours, the baby bald eagle had been plucked from its
nest in a tall spruce, lowered to the ground in a sack, put in a
portable dog pen and ferried on a bouncing skiff to a U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service vessel.
   The bird was to become one of more than 300 bald eagles captured
in Alaska and relocated in other states in an effort to replenish
the threatened national symbol.
   Bald eagles, an endangered species in every other state because
of lead poisoning, pollution and other man-made dangers, are
abundant in southeast Alaska, numbering about 12,000 at biologists'
last count _ about the number in all the other states combined.
   The region has become the stocking ground for eagle-recovery
programs in five states.
   ``The demand for birds is getting so great the supply can't meet
the demand, and Alaska's been a great bonanza for us,'' said Robert
D. Smith of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, which hopes to
release 60 bald eagles by 1990.
   Including 46 exported this year, Alaska has contributed 264 bald
eagles for relocation in New York, Indiana, Missouri, North
Carolina and Tennessee, said Mike Jacobson of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Juneau.
   From 1980 to 1987, 400 eagles from Alaska and elsewhere were
relocated in more than a dozen states, authorities say.
   Sightings of birds and nests make biologists confident the
program is succeeding, though they won't have statistical proof for
a few years.
   An eagle expedition begins with time-consuming helicopter
surveys. Fish and Wildlife workers fly over some 200 miles of
coastline each spring, plotting nests. Though eagle nests often
span 8 feet or more, the sticks, grass and other matter they're
made of camouflage them in the rain forest.
   Come July, biologists from other states fly in and board two
65-foot military surplus vessels run by the Fish and Wildlife
Service. The capture area is a half-day's cruise away in the middle
of the Tongass National Forest.
   Once there, Tennessee conservationist Kevin Schutt and fellow
tree-scaler Dave Evans climb to the nests.
   While they ascend, the adult birds fly in agitated circles or
perch in trees nearby, keening and trilling, and shy away from the
climber and his assistants. The young birds don't resist.
   ``Eagles, they're pretty docile,'' said Schutt.
   ``I don't think they've (climbers) ever been struck on this
project. It would be kind of unnerving to be 80 feet up a tree and
struck by a bird that's 12 to 14 pounds,'' said Fish and Wildlife's
Phil Schempf.
   Though the young eagles appear nearly full-size when they're
captured at 6 to 7 weeks of age, their feathers are soft and their
bodies unprepared for flight. They usually begin flying at 10 to 12
weeks.
   They don't gain the characteristic white head and tail feathers
until they are 3 or 4 years old, and their immature plummage varies
from dark brown to mottled brown and white.
   Caretakers band their legs for identification and dust them with
flea powder to kill feather lice.
   Once powdered, measured and recorded, the eagles ride out the
trip in relative comfort, dining twice daily on diced halibut and
snapper. They quickly adapt a tidy-nest instinct in their cages,
ejecting their refuse through the doors onto the deck and hapless
deckhands.
   Once the capture quota is met, the eagles are taken to Juneau
and the next stage of their travel aboard commercial airliners.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Pushing for Foreign Investment Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investment in the United States is
expected to accelerate dramatically this year, but the true scope
of overseas ownership remains hidden, a congressional critic
complains.
   ``We need to know if foreign ownership is concentrating itself
in key areas of our economy _ energy, steel, banking _ whether
foreign ownership is gaining control of key sectors of the American
economy,'' says Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
   Bryant came into the spotlight last year as sponsor of a
provision of the 1,000-page trade bill approved by the House. It
would have forced a major increase in the amount of disclosure
required of foreign investors.
   Lawmakers eventually dropped Bryant's heavily debated plan in an
unsuccessful effort to win President Reagan's approval. And it is
not part of the revised version of the trade bill now under debate.
   But Bryant is still pushing legislation to require foreign
owners to register their major U.S. assets with the Commerce
Department, including business, industrial, real estate and farm
holdings.
   The Reagan administration opposes his bill because ``they don't
want to look like the folks that gave away the store,'' the Dallas
Democrat said.
   Prospects for getting the bill to the president's desk this year
are not especially bright, but Bryant vows not to give up.
   To bolster his case, he cites a private study released last week
showing foreign ownership in the United States more than tripled
since 1980.
   The Congressional Economic Leadership Institute said foreign
investors own about 33 percent of prime commercial real estate in
Washington, D.C., 46 percent in Los Angeles, and 39 percent in
Houston.
   It said they own 10 percent of the U.S. manufacturing base, hold
a majority interest in concrete and consumer electronics
industries, and a significant portion in machine tools, chemicals
and auto parts.
   Nearly 3 million Americans are employed full or part-time as a
result of foreign investment, the study said.
   It acknowledged, however, that foreign investments still account
for no more than 5 percent to 6 percent of U.S. assets.
   Bryant said it is ``foolhardy'' to believe foreign investors
will avoid the United States if they must register their holdings
because ``every other country collects careful data'' without
scaring off business.
   Nancy LeaMond, president of the institute, said: ``In our
innermost circle of trading partners, we are the only nation that
swings the door open unconditionally to virtually every
investment.''
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and former Cabinet
official Elliot Richardson claim Bryant's bill is anti-competitive.
   Richardson testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that
it would discourage foreign investment and result in higher U.S.
interest rates and an economic slowdown.
   Richardson called the reporting requirements burdensome. He said
sufficient data already have been collected by 16 federal agencies
and that investors would have to reveal business secrets.
   In its study, the institute said an ``unprecedented transfer of
American assets to foreign control is under way.''
   Since 1980, foreign direct investment in the United States
expanded by more than 215 percent, while American investment abroad
jumped by one-fifth that rate, the study said.
   Foreign buy-outs are expected to make up as much as 20 percent
of U.S. acquisitions this year, up from 5 percent in 1987, said the
study, which based its findings on the latest available data from
the Commerce Department and other sources.

<TEXT>
   Ray Blanton, former congressman,
ex-governor and one-time inmate at a U.S. penitentiary, is hoping
for a big sympathy vote as he bids for political resurrection in
Thursday's Democratic primary for Congress.
   Blanton, who left the governor's office in 1979 in a swirl of
controversy over the sale of pardons and state liquor licenses,
said he expects voters to see that he was a victim of political
persecution.
   ``They know I was railroaded and falsely accused,'' he said.
   Blanton faces three primary opponents in Tennessee's 8th
District, a largely rural area that borders the Mississippi River
and runs from just north of Memphis to the Kentucky state line.
   The favorite, state Rep. John Tanner, has the support of Ed
Jones, the district's popular outgoing congressman, and has raised
more than $450,000 to Blanton's $25,000.
   ``I've got a million dollars worth of name recognition which I
have earned over the years,'' Blanton said. ``I haven't gone out
begging and haven't held any arm-twisting fund-raisers.''
   Blanton won some of that recognition when he was unceremoniously
dumped from the governor's office before his term expired in
January 1979.
   Fellow Democrats swore in Republican Lamar Alexander three days
early after Blanton abruptly pardoned three former felons and
commuted the sentences of 49 inmates, most of them armed robbers
and murderers.
   The pardon scandal, in which two of Blanton's aides were
convicted of taking bribes to free prisoners, became the subject of
the movie ``Marie,'' starring Sissy Spacek.
   Blanton was never charged in that scandal, but he was convicted
in federal court in 1981 of taking part in a scheme to sell state
liquor licenses.
   The conviction was on charges of conspiracy, extortion and mail
fraud. The fraud conviction was overturned after his release from
prison because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the definition of
the offense. A state court restored his citizenship rights last
year.
   Blanton, who represented the state's 7th District in Congress
from 1967 to 1972 and was Tennessee's chief executive from 1975 to
1979, is running on a platform of government experience and fair
play.
   ``There's a large silent vote that we still feel will come down
on my side,'' he said.
   Jones, who has represented the district without serious
opposition since 1969, said he has known Tanner all his life and
has followed his 12-year career in the Legislature.
   ``I might have retired two years ago but he wasn't ready,''
Jones said from his office in Washington.
   The other Democrats in the race are Jackson Mayor Bob Conger and
Ivy Scarborough, a Jackson lawyer.
   The race has produced few fireworks or sharp differences on
issues. The candidates promised to help create jobs, protect the
family farm, improve education and oppose drug dealers.
   None has seriously attacked Blanton in public for his prison
record, but Tanner has been criticized as too well financed and
tied to the district's political establishment.
   Three Republicans are running in the GOP primary.

<HEAD>Newspapers Attack Government Ban On Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers on Sunday condemned
the government's ban on ``Cry Freedom'' and said the anti-apartheid
film could help South Africans confront and address their deep
racial divisions.
   The movie tells the story of black South African activist Steve
Biko, who died in police detention in 1977, and white journalist
Donald Woods, who befriended him.
   The film was approved by government censors Friday morning and
immediately began playing in 30 theaters nationwide. However,
police seized the film seven hours later, saying it was
contributing to the ``revolutionary climate'' in South Africa.
   ``South Africans have been reminded anew that the government
wants to decide for them what they should see, think, feel,'' the
independent Sunday Star said in an editorial.
   ``The central point about `Cry Freedom' is ... whether South
Africans are mature enough to confront a substantially accurate and
thoroughly discomfiting piece of recent history,'' the Star said.
``We think they are.''
   During the film's brief run, three bombs exploded at theaters
where the movie was shown and there were several bomb threats.
There were no injuries. On Saturday, a bomb blast at a shopping
area in a white suburb outside Johannesburg killed one woman and
injured 56.
   Police cited the theater attacks as proof that the controversial
film was a threat to public safety. Never before has a film shown
in South Africa contained such emotional and violent scenes related
to the government's apartheid policies.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in
national affairs. The country's 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate residential areas, schools and health
services.
   The banning ``is an act of a desperate government whose thoughts
are clouded with fear and uncertainty,'' said the black-oriented
City Press. ``We are dealing with certain government officials who
do not have the slightest idea of the basic tenets of freedom of
thought and expression.''
   The independent Sunday Times, the country's largest Sunday
newspaper, said the government was more worried about the film's
``considerable truth'' than its alleged anti-South Africa
propaganda.
   ``The challenge of `Cry Freedom' for whites is to commit
themselves to redressing those wrongs (of racial discrimination),''
the Sunday Times said.
   ``The test for black South Africans is to rise above the
bitterness ... and take up the task of constructive participation
in building a better South Africa,'' it added.
   The Sunday Times and The Sunday Star both ran front-page stories
suggesting that international distributors of movies and television
programs could face increased pressure to pull out of South Africa
following the ban on ``Cry Freedom.''

   Three doctors who dub themselves the
Bruise Brothers say if you've got stress, they've got the cure.
Their prescription: a strong dose of rock 'n' roll.
   ``Some people find it a little hard to believe, but once they
hear us, they see that we can play,'' said Dr. Robert Falcone,
director of LifeFlight Trauma Services at Grant Medical Center, who
plays bass guitar and sings.
   The four-man, one-woman band includes the three doctors: a
trauma surgeon, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and a family
practitioner; and a pilot and a hospital vice president.
   The band belts out a nostalgic mix of 1960s British pop by the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Animals and the Yardbirds.
   The group was organized for a talent show last year, which was
successful enough to encourage the band to continue. They charge
$600 for a night's work.
   ``The rock 'n' roll really helps to relax me,'' said Falcone,
38. ``It was something I really liked as a kid and I missed it.
   ``I love music, like playing in front of people and enjoy having
a good time. It's fun and always has been.''

   Some 160,000 people had one thing on their
mind _ and on their breath _ as they gathered this weekend to munch
on mushrooms, burritos, ice cream and other treats liberally
smothered in garlic.
   The 10th annual Gilroy Garlic Festival featured 85 booths of
garlic-spiced foods from nearly every imaginable ethnic, national
and cultural background. Arts and crafts booths featured items like
14-carat gold garlic-motif jewelry and garlic perfume.
   A big item was Mrs. M's garlic-peanut butter-chocolate candies.
Stuffed into little cups, about 7,000 were sold last year for 75
cents each.
   ``We sell them like mad,'' said Harriett Macioge, alias Mrs. M.
   ``Some people tell me it tastes like a Reese's Cup with a little
garlic at the end, but I don't like peanut butter, so I can't
answer your question personally,'' she added, when asked to
describe their taste.
   Some 32,000 people attended opening day of the festival on
Friday, about equal to last year's record opening-day crowd, said
John Parrinello, festival vice president.
   Among the revelers was Mary Johnson of Seattle, who said she
came mainly to taste garlic ice icream, a delicacy she has for
years dreamed about.
   ``I've heard about the Garlic Festival for years,'' she said as
she prepared to go from booth to booth on Gourmet Alley. ``This
year I just had to come. I want to try everything with garlic in
it.''
   Gilroy Foods, the world's largest dehydrator of onions and
garlic, expects to give away about 50,000 cones filled with
chocolate-garlic ice cream, to Johnson's delight.

<HEAD>Shultz Willing To Meet With Iranian Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz said Sunday
he would be willing to meet with Iran's foreign minister if a
meeting were requested.
   Shultz, in an interview on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''
indicated direct U.S.-Iranian talks could include discussions about
an end to the Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking but not
the return of Iranian assets, which is being handled by an
international court.
   Shultz said U.S. officials are trying to find ``an authoritative
channel'' for direct talks with Iran but he has not sought a
meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati during the
Iranian official's visit to the United Nations for peace talks.
   ``We don't have to go running around after people,'' Shultz
said. But he added, ``It's important to Iran to have a relationship
with the United States and that will emerge in due time.''
   Asked if he would meet with Velayati if such a meeting were
requested, Shultz replied, ``Sure,'' adding, ``I don't know that
it's necessarily the right way to start, to have the foreign
ministers meet, but at any rate we have stated our policy.''
   He indicated the United States continues to make contacts with
Iran through third countries and said U.S. officials have
repeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on ``what
it takes for them to become part of the civilized community.''
   He said if Iran will stop the war, stop being involved in
terrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages, then ``there
is a prospect of more normal relations with us.''
   Shultz said the issue of releasing nine Americans held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon would have to be separate from
financial and other considerations.
   He noted that the issue of releasing Iranian assets held by the
United States is being handled by a claims tribunal court in The
Hague and ``there is no reason to disrupt it.'' Iranian officials
have suggested they might work for release of the hostages if the
assets are returned, but Reagan administration officials have said
they will make no such deal.
   Shultz described the U.S. effort to sell arms to Iran in
exchange for the hostages as ``an aberration'' and said the United
States has a constant policy.

<HEAD>Rain Brings Some Relief To Indiana Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grass is green and the crops are
growing again in southern Indiana thanks to rain that fell during
the past two weeks. The moisture has also given new life to the
hopes of farmers.
   ``Everything was brown, and then just in a couple of days it
started greening, and it looks like spring now,'' said Shirley
Heidrick, who farms 750 acres in eastern Owen County with her
husband, Ron.
   The worst drought in decades had dried out the couple's fields,
but the recent rain improved chances that they will harvest enough
corn and soybeans to make the loan payments on the spring planting,
Mrs. Heidrick said.
   ``We're doing fine, you know. Things are looking better, and we
just keep working,'' she said.
   South-central Indiana got more rain in July, most of it in the
third week, than in May and June together. The National Weather
Service in Indianapolis lists July rainfall of 3.88 inches. May and
June had 1.42 inches of rain.
   Milk production is up at Jim Elliott's Owen County dairy farm,
where cows have more grass to eat and his once-dry pond again has
water.
   ``We just really don't know where we stand right now, but it
don't look near as bleak as it did before it started raining,''
Elliott said.
   ``I had a lot of corn that was waist-high before the rain, and
it's head-high now,'' he said. ``On my better soybeans, they grew
something like a foot-and-a-half. They were about knee-high, the
taller ones. Now they're up pretty near hip-high.''
   Janet Hasler, of southern Greene County, said the outlook is
much brighter now than it was three weeks ago, when her family
planned to sell 20 sows and 100 baby feeder pigs because of a lack
of feed corn.
   The rain may have saved enough corn that the cuts won't have to
be so drastic, she said.
   ``The first night it rained, Don stood outside and watched it
rain. He just stood out on our porch,'' Hasler said. ``We've got
green grass again, and the weeds are growing, and all of that good
stuff. There's lots of mudholes for the pigs to wallow in. It looks
like a normal summer now.''
   Despite the increased rainfall, farmers remain uncertain about
how they will fare during the winter. Many face shortages of hay
and corn to feed their livestock, and sharply reduced crop income.
   A Purdue University agricultural expert says only 9 percent of
Indiana farmers have federal crop insurance.
   While the rain halted a steady decline in anticipated yields,
experts don't have enough experience with droughts to know how much
it will allow crops to recover, said Terry Strueh, assistant to
Purdue's dean of agriculture.
   ``There are none of us that ever experienced anything like this
before,'' Strueh said last week. ``This is the worst we've ever had
since we kept records,'' starting about the turn of the century.

<HEAD>$5 Million Lottery Winner Jailed in Alleged Death Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who won $5 million in a lottery only
to end up with her house being seized for back taxes has now been
arrested and accused of plotting to kill her daughter-in-law.
   Mary Ellen Futch, 64, on Saturday ``negotiated a contract with
our undercover detective for $5,000'' to kill the wife of her
youngest son, said Hillsborough County Sheriff's spokesman Jack
Espinosa.
   Mrs. Futch was ordered held without bond and charged with
soliciting for the first-degree murder of Peggy Futch, 23. If
convicted, she faces a prison term of up to 30 years.
   Her son, Henry Futch, said money troubles had left his mother
distraught, but he and his wife said they were still shocked.
   ``She was over here yesterday, laughing and drinking coffee,''
said Peggy Futch. ``We had our spats, but I would apologize to her
or she would apologize to me.''
   Like other members of the family, Peggy Futch said she could not
believe the plot was serious and did not think her mother-in-law
belonged in jail.
   Mrs. Futch won her jackpot in a Lotto drawing in Ontario,
Canada, on Sept. 15, 1984, and received $5 million in a lump sum.
She bought the ticket at the Toronto airport during a vacation.
   With the money she bought a house to be near her son, whom
family members said she doted on. News reports at the time said she
once tipped a man $7,000 just to play pool with her son.
   She also gave away some money, then made bad investments in
Canada. And the Intenal Revenue Service said she failed to pay any
income tax in the United States, as the law required.
   The IRS, which claims she owes $5 million in back taxes,
interest and penalties, has seized her home and plans to auction it
off Wednesday, said Henry Futch.
   Espinosa declined to comment on a possible motive for the
alleged contract-murder deal.
   Neighbor Patsy Rice said Mrs. Futch once asked her to try to
break the couple up. ``The money did cause a lot of problems,''
Mrs. Rice said.
   Futch conceded his mother was overprotective.
   ``She never would let me have any friends,'' he said. ``She
would always chase them off whenever I'd bring one home.''
   Her daughter-in-law said she was worried about Mrs. Futch, who
suffers high blood pressure and heart problems.
   ``I don't think jail is the place,'' said Peggy Futch. ``I think
that's too hard on her.''

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like most of Hollywood, actor Peter
Falk is awaiting the end of the writers strike so work can resume
on six new episodes of the hit 1970s detective series ``Columbo.''
   ``I don't know why people liked (that character) so much,'' Falk
said during a recent interview at his home.
   ``I like people that are abstracted, that are pre-occupied with
something, so they're unaware what they look like,'' he said
referring to the rumpled, tenacious detective whose exploits
endeared him to millions of television viewers.
   ``Without affectation, he's genuinely absorbed by what it is
that makes the elevator light go on when you push the button,''
Falk said.
   While awaiting the resumption of production, Falk will be seen
playing an amiable con man opposite Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum
in the comedy movie ``Vibes,'' which opens Friday.
   ``I had a good time playing (the part),'' Falk said. ``The guy
lied with such enthusiasm, with imagination, the fact he would
actually be hurt when people didn't believe him was appealing.''

<HEAD>Soviet Inspection Teams Considering Sites In Four States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four teams of Soviet missile experts are
arriving Monday night for a third round of inspections at U. S.
missile sites, a spokesman for the U.S. said Sunday.
   They will choosebe from missile facilities in Florida, Alabama,
Maryland and Oklahoma, said the U.S. inspection agency spokesman,
Navy Cmdr. Kendell Pease.
   The inspection, called for under the Intermediate-range Missile
Treaty, is to begin Wednesday, with the Soviet teams selecting
sites to inspect just before they are flown to the areas from
Washington in U.S. Air Force planes, said Pease.
   Each Soviet team of 10 is to be accompanied by a comparable U.S.
contingent, Pease said.
   He said the teams stay at the facilities for up to 24 hours.
They can go to Cape Canaveral, Fla.; Redstone Arsenal at
Huntsville, Ala.; Middle River, Md., or Fort Sill at Lawton, Okla.
   The treaty signed last December by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev calls for the elimination of all
intermediate-range missiles within three years.
   In 60 days of initial inspections before destruction of the
missiles begins, Soviet teams are being allowed to inspect 26 sites
in the United States and Europe. U.S. teams have been going to the
Soviet Union to visit 133 locations.

   Soviet officials are promising to reveal one
of their deepest military secrets, one that Defense Minister Dmitri
Yazoz says is a mystery even to him: the size of the defense budget.
   That military budget will again be near the top of the agenda as
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci opens his third round of talks
with Yazov in Moscow on Monday.
   Soviet defense officials in the past said their annual spending
was about 20 billion rubles, or $33 billion, just over one-tenth of
the Pentagon budget.
   But analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon say
Soviet defense spending is close to that of the United States,
accounting for 15 percent to 17 percent of the Soviet gross
national product.
   And Yazov, during his two previous meetings with Carlucci, has
pegged Soviet defense spending at about 16 percent of GNP, very
close to the U.S. estimate.
   ``We welcome that kind of truth now,'' a senior Pentagon
official said on the eve of Carlucci's departure for Moscow.
   ``But that new candor doesn't substitute for the fact that they
still don't present a detailed public, accurate accounting of what
their military budget really is and what it goes for,'' said the
U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States, which has an economy estimated at double that
of the Soviet Union, spent 6.6 percent of GNP on defense in 1986,
according to U.S. government statistics.
   The Soviets say they don't know exactly what they are spending
on defense because their data does not account for weapons
research, development and production, which consume more than half
the Pentagon budget. Nowhere are the Soviet numbers pulled together.
   And in a country where the government owns all industry, the
Soviet military pays artificially low prices for goods that in many
cases are not even available to civilian factories, such as special
steel alloys.
   ``It is kind of hard for us to believe that they don't know how
much in detail they spend on military matters, but maybe it's
true,'' said the senior Pentagon official.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for reforms
throughout society, including the military, and wants the Defense
Ministry to produce a complete and reliable budget. Ultimately, he
wants to improve the international climate enough to allow him to
divert resources into the civilian sector.
   Vadim Kuznetsov, deputy director of the U.S.A. desk at the
Soviet Foreign Ministry, said in a recent interview in Moscow that
his nation would make good on its pledge to publish a detailed
defense budget by the early 1990s.
   ``In two, three or four years, we will have much more correct
figures on military spending,'' said Kuznetsov. That will take a
new system of accounting, similar to the one in which civilian
factories must pay their way or shut down, rather than exist on
state subsidies, as has been the case.
   ``Under the old system, a truck could cost many times less for
the military than for a collective farm'' because of price
manipulation, said Kuznetsov.
   ``When we have price reform, the new price will reflect the
production costs for everybody,'' he said. ``When a truck costs as
much for a collective farm as it does for the military, then we
will have more accurate figures on military spending.''
   But Soviet military spending will stay below that of America,
said Kuznetsov, ``because we have compulsive military service. We
practically pay our soldiers nothing. They get some pocket money
for cigarettes, that's all.''
   In the United States, which since 1972 has had an all-volunteer
military, military salaries make up $78.3 billion of the annual
Pentagon budget of $289.3 billion, according to Defense Department
statistics.
   The new Soviet accounting method will bolster Gorbachev's policy
of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness in discussing previously taboo
subjects.
   ``At public lectures, people would ask how with so few rubles in
the budget, we could have military parity with the United States,
which spends $300 billion,'' said Kuznetsov.
   The financial affairs of the Soviet Defense Ministry always have
been secret, reviewed only by a handful of top Kremlin leaders.
   Now, however, Gorbachev and his allies are calling for greater
powers for the national parliament, the Supreme Soviet. And
Kuznetsov says the day is not too distant when the Soviet defense
minister will be summoned before a legislative committee and asked
to defend his budget in open session.
   Even the revised accounting methods being discussed in the
Soviet Union may not show the true cost of Soviet military
spending, according to Andrew Marshall, head of the Pentagon's
Office of Net Assessment.
   Marshall, in an article printed by the congressional Joint
Economic Committee last November, estimated that Soviet military
spending may account for between 20 and 30 percent of GNP.
   To reach that total, Marshall added:
   _Traditionally military spending, including personnel, weapons,
research and development, and the military side of the space
program;
   _Additional costs, such as civil defense and scarce resources
diverted from civilian industry;
   _And ``the cost of external empire, costs that are undertaken
for the purposes of increasing protection of the Soviet Union
and@or for the expansion of its influence in the world.''
   Even under glasnost, Soviet officials are only beginning to
discuss the pricklier aspects of their military spending.

   Jordan's King Hussein has posed a challenge
to Israel, the United States, the Palestine Liberation Organization
and the strength of his own society by loosening Jordan's ties with
Palestine.
   The king on Sunday appeared to rule out the idea of Jordan
representing Palestinians in any peace talks and said his country's
links to Palestinians in the occupied territories hamper their
fight against occupation.
   Rumors swept Amman that further steps were possible _ perhaps
replacement of Palestinian members of his Cabinet.
   Hussein already dissolved the lower house of Parliament, where
30 of the 60 members represented the West Bank. He also canceled a
major West Bank development project.
   But overly strong measures could shake the foundations of a
kingdom with a majority population of Palestinian refugees and
immigrants tied by blood and bank accounts to the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Hussein's moves stem from the Palestinian uprising on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East War.
   Protesters there clearly have demonstrated the PLO's
overwhelming popularity, and Jordan's relative lack of it.
   The Arab summit in Algiers in June, which was called to back the
uprising, placed political and financial control from the outside
clearly in the PLO's hands, upsetting some Jordanian officials who
argued the Arab leaders had ignored Jordan's historic
responsibilities to the region.
   By stepping back, Hussein is honoring PLO requests. But he also
may be seeking to force the PLO and Arab leaders to recognize
Jordan's crucial role in the occupied lands, where most
Palestinians still carry Jordanian passports.
   For Israel and its American supporters, it could mean that for
now, there is no viable alternative to dealing with the PLO if they
want peace.
   Both have shunned the organization, claiming it is a terrorist
body and _ more significantly _ fearing its demand for a
Palestinian state on the flank of Israel.
   Both have tried for two decades to force the Palestinians under
Jordan's wing and to talk peace with Jordan without the PLO.
   But Hussein said in Algiers he would not negotiate with Israel
over Palestine, repeating a warning he gave U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz in April.
   That leaves Shultz's Middle East peace effort, keyed on Jordan,
in limbo.
   Jordan's move also challenges the PLO, which for more than two
decades has failed to win open recognition from either America or
Israel.
   The PLO also must find ways to aid the occupied territories that
bypass Israeli security aimed specifically at halting PLO influence.
   Hoping to encourage moderate Jordanian influence, Israel had
tacitly cooperated with Jordan's development plan prior to the
uprising.
   It also gave Jordanian Parliament members VIP treatment crossing
the usually arduous bridge security after Hussein revived
Parliament in 1983 _ a move criticized at the time by the PLO.
   The Parliament had been dormant since 1974, the year Arabs made
the PLO sole representative for Palestinians, in part because no
elections could be held on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Jordan cannot afford to cut too deeply into its ties with
Palestinians. They dominate Amman's economy and the remittances
sent to Jordan by Palestinians in the gulf are its most important
source of foreign exhange.
   Most of the 800,000 West Bank residents still hold Jordanian
passports and about 18,000 still receive Jordanian salaries.
   Jordanian money is still common currency. Jordanian texts are
used in schools. Jordanian officials administer hundreds of mosques
and Islamic charities.
   Until Israel choked traffic over the Jordan river bridges,
thousands of Palestinians crossed weekly to visit family or friends
and handle bank accounts on either side of the line.
   Hussein's great-grandfather is buried in Jerusalem.
   Those close ties have made Jordan and the PLO natural rivals for
Palestinian affections, creating distrust that flared into open
warfare in 1970.
   Although Jordan accepted a 1974 Arab summit resolution declaring
the PLO the sole representative of the Palestinians, it continued
to insist it had responsibilities for them, and under international
law, sovereignty over the West Bank.
   But the king's palace advisers appeared to be shocked by the
strength of anti-Jordanian sentiment expressed during the
8-month-old Palestinian uprising. Jordanian backers were often
harassed and threatened, sometimes attacked.
   Jordanian officials also were knocked politically off balance by
the uprising-inspired wave of pro-PLO sentiment in the Arab world
following Jordanian pressure on the PLO to meet American conditions
for dealing with the organization _ effective recognition of Israel.

   Three days after an Oklahoma boys soccer team was
bumped from a flight to Brazil, a specially arranged jetliner flew
them and 349 other stranded passengers to Sao Paulo on Sunday.
   Pan American World Airways wrangled special permission from the
Brazilian government to add a non-stop flight to Sao Paulo, and the
flight left Miami International Airport Sunday morning, said
spokesman Alan Loflin.
   ``We've got some happy people on the way, or relieved,'' Loflin
said.
   The ordeal began Thursday for 36 boys and 15 adults of a group
of 94 headed to a tournament in Brazil, where the youths were to
play in televised games. Although the group had tickets, the
carrier couldn't fit the entire group on the last leg of its
Oklahoma-to-Brazil journey.
   The stranded soccer players and their chaperones stayed in a
nearby hotel for two nights, then camped out at the airport
Saturday to save money.
   Robert Daniels, traveling with his son, said the boys were
miserable as hours were whittled away from their eight-day trip.
Some were just worried about what they might be missing.
   ``Naked topless women, the beaches,'' said Eric Cummins, 14. ``I
guess we're just looking forward to seeing a new culture.''

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mortician touring an empty funeral home in
search of used equipment discovered the embalmed body of a man who
had been dead four years, police said.
   Real estate agent Delores Franklin was waiting outside the
former James Kotsis funeral home about 2 p.m. Saturday when the
mortician ran out, saying he'd seen a body at the bottom of the
stairs.
   Ms. Franklin, who was accompanied by her 9-year-old daughter,
looked inside and saw the body stretched on a gurney.
   ``I didn't want to see it,'' she said.
   According to police, the body was that of a man who died April
1, 1984. The corpse had gone unclaimed and was sent to the state
Anatomy Board, which apparently tracked down a son.
   The body went to the funeral establishment but the son never
showed up, according to police. Since then, the body had been kept
in the basement.
   The funeral home moved but did not advise the real estate agency
about the body, police said. Ms. Franklin said the building is
being sold, and the mortician was touring the building because he
was thinking of buying some of the old equipment.
   The body was to be returned to the Anatomy Board because the
corpse had not been claimed.
   Both the Kotsis funeral home number and the personal number of
James Kotsis listed in the telephone book are disconnected. No new
number was given, and directory assistance had no listing in the
Baltimore area.

   Police on Sunday jailed a Palestinian described
as the top PLO activist in the occupied lands and charged him with
inciting unrest. Authorities also urged prosecution of Israeli
civilians in the deaths of three Arabs.
   Police also detained the head of an Arab merchants' group in
Jerusalem, who was held without charges or the promise of a trial,
in so-called administrative detention, police spokeswoman Nurit
Buton said.
   The spokeswoman said eight other Palestinians were rounded up
for questioning about suspected involvement in a wave of recent
stoning attacks in Jerusalem.
   In the West Bank, a 19-year-old Arab was shot in the leg during
clashes with troops near the city of Jenin, hospital officials said.
   Pro-PLO activist Faisal Husseini, who has been described by
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin as the top Palestine Liberation
Organization activist in Israeli-held territories, was arrested at
his home in a pre-dawn raid and ordered held for six months without
trial.
   ``Everyone who wants peace is put in jail,'' Husseini's wife,
Najad, told The Associated Press. ``My husband was speaking about
peace, nothing else.''
   Another leading pro-PLO activist, Hanna Siniora, and about a
dozen members of the Peace Now movement protested Husseini's arrest
in front of the Jerusalem detention center where he was held.
   Husseini's arrest follows a meeting at a Jerusalem theater in
which he engaged in public dialogue with Israeli peace activists
and Moshe Amirav, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
Bloc.
   During the session, Husseini, 48, endorsed a document drawn up
by PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif, who called for direct talks
between the PLO and Israel at an international Middle East peace
conference.
   Israel has rejected direct dialogue with the PLO, which it
considers a terrorist group.
   ``As a Palestinian, my problem is with the Israelis _ so I must
speak with them,'' Husseini told several hundred Israelis.
   Police accused him of being an activist in PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah guerrilla faction and of being involved
in ``coordinating, inciting, and establishing'' the nearly
8-month-old Palestinian uprising, Ms. Buton said.
   Police ordered the closure of the Arab Studies Center in
Jerusalem _ which Husseini directs _ for one year starting Sunday,
charging it was financed by Arafat's Fatah group and was used to
advance the aims of the uprising, which has claimed the lives of
235 Palestinians and four Israelis.
   Mustafa Tawfiq Abu Zahara, head of a Jerusalem merchants' group,
was detained Sunday and accused of organizing demonstrations and
boycotts of Israeli products as well as inciting Palestinians not
to pay taxes, Ms. Buton said.
   She said Abu Zahara spent 18 months in jail in 1979 on charges
of helping a convicted terrorist.
   Husseini has spent 12 of the past 16 months in administrative
detention.
   Husseini said an arrest last fall may have been partly the
result of secret talks he held with Amirav. In an interview, th
activist suggested his dialogue Wednesday with the Israelis may
again have angered authorities.
   ``This may have been one of the reasons I was arrested,''
Husseini told The Associated Press.
   Labor Party legislator Abba Eban Sunday criticized the arrest.
   ``I see this as unwise, all this game of hide-and-seek with Arab
leaders,'' Eban said in an interview with Israel Army radio.
   Israeli authorities are holding about 2,500 Palestinians without
trial, the majority rounded up since the beginning of the uprising.
   In another development, police officials confirmed they
recommended the prosecution of Israeli civilians in the shooting
deaths of three West Bank residents.
   The statement came in response to a query by left-wing
legislator Dedi Zucker on the status of investigations into 13
Palestinian deaths in which Israeli civilians were suspected.
   Police did not say how many Israelis could be prosecuted.
   Police recommended prosecution in the case involving the Jan. 11
shooting death of Nasser Ghanem Hammad, 17, of the West Bank
village Betin, said Nahum Shaked, a spokesman for Police Minister
Chaim Bar-Lev.
   The report did not name the suspect, but police at the time held
Pinhas Wallerstein, a prominent Jewish settler leader, for
questioning. The army has said Wallerstein opened fire after being
stoned by Palestinian youths, but Arab witnesses said Hammad was
killed without provocation.
   In three other cases, police recommended that no charges be
filed for lack of evidence, said Shaked.

   An Afghan guerrilla spokesman said
Sunday that guerrillas will release two Soviet prisoners of war as
a gesture of good will.
   The news came as the Soviet news agency Tass reported that
Afghan rebels staged a rocket attack on their capital of Kabul,
killing one person and wounding three.
   Tass, quoting Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency, said
several houses were damaged by the ground-to-ground missiles. It
gave no further details.
   The attack was the latest in a series on Kabul and other Afghan
cities by rebels seeking to topple the Marxist government of
President Najib.
   The seven-party Afghan Guerrilla Alliance, based in Pakistan's
frontier city of Peshawar, said in a news release in Islamabad that
two prisoners of war were being freed as a ``good-will gesture.''
   Ahmad Gailani, chairman of the alliance, said the Soviet Union's
reaction to the prisoner release would decide the fate of Soviet
troops still held by Afghan guerrillas. The Soviets say 312
soldiers are missing in Afghanistan.
   The alliance wants to hold direct talks with the Soviet Union,
both about imprisoned Soviet soldiers and the peaceful withdrawal
of Red Army troops from Afghanistan.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, another guerrilla leader, said at a news
conference in Islamabad that the Soviet Union must initiate talks.
   Azim Nasser Zia, with Gailani's National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, said the Soviet Union had ``already'' indicated a
willingness to talk about prisoners of war but the guerrillas
wanted talks expanded to include other issues, including the Soviet
withdrawal.
   The Soviets began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan May 15.
Under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord signed in April, it must
withdraw half of its more than 100,000 estimated troops by Aug. 15
and the rest by next Feb. 15.
   Guerrilla leaders have said that until the Soviet Union opens
direct talks with them, they cannot guarantee safe passage for
withdrawing troops.
   The Kremlin ordered troops and tanks into Afghanistan in
December 1979 to prop up the communist government there.
   Since the Soviets began their pullout, official Soviet and
Afghan media have been reporting a sharp increase in attacks on
Afghan cities by the mostly Moslem guerrillas.

   A passenger bus hit a tow truck and
overturned in northeastern Spain Sunday, killing at least nine
people, the provincial civil governor's office said.
   The bus overturned near Vendrell, a town about 30 miles east of
this northeastern city, police said. The bus was carrying about 75
people, all Spaniards, from Barcelona to the southern city of
Seville the governor's office said.
   The governor's office said the bus hit a tow truck, which had
stopped on the side of the road to help a motorist with a flat tire.
   Police were investigating why the bus overturned.

   Banks and money exchanges will be
closed Monday and Tuesday while the government implements a new
anti-inflation economic package, a legislator announced Sunday.
   Cesar Jaroslavsky, a member of the House of Deputies, made the
announcement as he left a meeting at the official residence of
President Raul Alfonsin in suburban Olivos.
   Jaroslavsky refused to comment on the contents of the plan.
   Alfonsin and Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille were reported to
be awaiting the return Sunday from Washington of Treasury Secretary
Mario Brodersohn and Central Bank President Jose Luis Machinea to
put the finishing touches on the plan.
   Brodersohn and Machinea met last week with International
Monetary Fund officials in an effort to obtain new loans, including
a $1.2 billion standby loan to help pay interest on the country's
$53 billion foreign debt.
   It is not unusual for Argentine banks and other financial
institutions to be ordered to close for up to 48 hours, to avoid
speculation, when major changes in economic policy are scheduled.
   No official statements have been made about the planned steps to
reduce inflation, which registered 321.7 percent over the last
year. The cost of living rose 18 percent in June and the increase
for July is expected to exceed 20 percent.
   Buenos Aires newspapers speculated that the package will include
a 10 percent devaluation of the austral, the national currency,
modification of the two-tier exchange rate system and an increase
in taxes on agricultural exports.
   They reported it also could involve a 22-26 percent increase in
public utility and transport rates and a request for businessmen to
voluntarily limit price increases to 6 percent during August.

   After Kevin Ives and his best friend were
run over by a train, the state medical examiner ruled they had
smoked so much marijuana that they lay down on the tracks and did
not hear the roar of the oncoming Union Pacific freight.
   Dr. Fahmy Malak's report said the boys slept as if in a coma,
motionless, in identical positions, their legs across the rails and
their torsos between the tracks, as the train bore down with horn
blaring and bells clanging.
   But the youths' parents refused to accept Malak's ruling of
accidental death. It was extremely unlikely that marijuana could
have had such an extreme effect, they said, and that the boys would
pass out in identical positions.
   ``We're willing to go to any length to solve this thing,'' said
Larry Ives, Kevin's father. ``All we want to know is what happened.
If someone can convince us beyond a doubt that this is what
happened, we can let it go. But until then, as long as there's a
doubt, we will pursue it.''
   Their determination prompted investigations by a grand jury, the
FBI and the Arkansas State Police into the Aug. 23, 1987 deaths of
Ives, 17, and 16-year-old Don Henry, on the tracks about 15 miles
southwest of Little Rock.
   In June, grand jurors issued a preliminary report saying the
deaths were ``probably homicide.'' The grand jury has continued
meeting but has not rendered a final report.
   ``We feel that people connected in the drug business know
something about these deaths,'' special deputy prosecuting attorney
Dan Harmon said last month. Several witnesses who came before the
grand jury have been charged with drug trafficking and other
offenses.
   The boys' parents initially accepted Malak's autopsy report,
``not knowing any more about marijuana than we did,'' Ives said.
   His wife, Linda, began reading books about marijuana and its
effects. They talked to experts on marijuana.
   ``The more we found out about it, the less likely it seemed that
that was the real cause,'' Ives said.
   Ives, coincidentally a Union Pacific engineer, said he recreated
the death scene in his mind during late-night train runs.
   ``Several times, I've tried to simulate the situation and see
how much reaction time I would have, to get an idea of exactly how
much time the boys had after the horns started blowing and all that
to make some type of movement,'' Ives said.
   The boys had told Don's parents they were going hunting, and a
.22-caliber rifle and flashlight were found at the accident scene.
Several students said the youths told them they were going
``spotlighting'' for deer, using a light to temporarily blind the
animals and make them easier to shoot.
   Witnesses at a public hearing in February said they smoked
marijuana with Kevin and Don the night before their deaths, with
estimates ranging from one cigarette to about five shared by a
group of nine teen-agers.
   At the same hearing, Malak stood by his judgment that the
``psychedelic'' effects of marijuana could have knocked the the
boys out.
   The results of an independent autopsy have not been made public,
but Saline County Deputy Prosecutor Richard Garrett has presented
testimony from medical experts and quoted researchers as calling it
``highly unlikely, if not impossible, for a person to pass out from
smoking marijuana.''
   ``Common sense would also tell you that it would not be probable
that any two people would pass out at the same time from the use of
any drug or alcohol, and for them to pass out in exactly the same
position would really be improbable,'' Garrett said.

   Thunderstorms developed Sunday around the Great Lakes and New
England, and temperatures soared to record highs in the upper
Midwest.
   Temperatures reached the upper 90s and above 100 degrees in the
central part of the nation, and readings in South Dakota and
southern Minnesota were higher than in the desert Southwest.
   In Minnesota, the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport had a record 105
degrees and St. Cloud reached a record 100. Des Moines, Iowa,
sweltered through a record 101.
   It was the 34th day of 90-degree weather for Minneapolis and St.
Paul this summer, just two days shy of their record for any one
year.
   Thunderstorms produced severe weather in Minnesota during the
morning. High wind downed power lines in Woodland and south of
Hibbing, and blew the roof off the porch of a home in Woodland, the
National Weather Service said.
   Hibbing got 1.55 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m.
EDT.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell near the central Minnesota towns
of Staples and Motley, the Todd County Sheriff's Department
reported. A funnel cloud was sighted at Twig, about 10 miles
northwest of Duluth, the weather service said.
   Showers lingered over northern and central Wisconsin and over
northwestern Upper Michigan.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms developed along the coast of New
England during the afternoon.
   Elsewhere, widely scattered showers and thunderstorms were over
the Southeast, the western Gulf Coast region, the Rio Grande Valley
of Texas, and the southern Rockies. Dyersburg, Tenn., got 1.48
inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 106 at Chamberlain, S.D. The
low Saturday morning was 41 degrees at Jackson, Wyo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from south-central Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms also were forecast across the Great Lakes
region, northern sections of the Ohio Valley, the upper Mississippi
Valley, the middle Missouri Valley, the Rocky Mountain region, and
the southern and central Plateau.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted in western Washington state and
northwestern Oregon; below 90 from the Northwest through North
Dakota to New England; around 100 at some locations in the central
Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley; above 100 in the some of
the deserts and valleys of the Southwest; and in the 90s around
much of the rest of the country.

   ABC says it will put situation-comedies and
comedy theatrical movies up against the Olympics on NBC in
September.
   ABC also said it plans to go up against the World Series on NBC
in October with a rerun of the miniseries ``North and South.''
   All the networks' fall schedules have been put on hold because
of the 5-month-old strike by the Writers Guild.
   ABC's weekend announcement said it would begin on Sept. 17
repeating the sitcoms ``Growing Pains,'' ``Who's the Boss?'' ``Head
of the Class,'' ``Perfect Strangers'' and ``Full House'' each night
of the week in the 8-9 p.m. EDT time period.
   They will be followed by comedy movies such as ``The Man with
One Red Shoe,'' starring Tom Hanks; ``Club Paradise,'' with Robin
Williams; ``Night Shift,'' with Michael Keaton and Shelley Long;
``All of Me,'' with Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin, and ``Stand by
Me.''
   ABC will also fill in with ``reality-based'' series not affected
by the writers' strike, repeats of old series, including ``Police
Story'' and ``Mission: Impossible,'' news documentaries and
``Monday Night Football,'' which begins Sept. 5.
   The interim schedule lasts until Oct. 3. Then ABC carries
baseball playoffs until the World Series. ``North and South''
begins running on Oct. 18.

   Iran said aviation experts listened
Sunday to cockpit-to-ground conversation taped minutes before a
U.S. warship shot down an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf,
killing 290 people.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization experts, who are
in Iran to investigate the U.S. missile attack of the Iran Air jet,
also visited a civil aviation control center.
   Iranian officials presented ``necessary documents'' to the team,
which is investigating at the request of Iran, said the official
Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   The agency said the five-man team listened to conversation taped
minutes before the crash between the pilot of the Airbus and the
control centers in the southern Iranian town of Bandar Abbas,
Tehran and the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai.
   IRNA did not elaborate on the meeting.
   The U.S. guided missile cruiser Vincennes shot down the plane
July 3. American military officials said the plane was approaching
in an ``attack pattern'' and transmitting military-style
transponder signals.
   Iran denied both claims. The two sides also have given
conflicting accounts of the plane's altitude at the time it was
downed by American surface-to-air missiles from the Vincennes.
   The plane was shot down over the gulf during a short flight from
Bandar Abbas to Dubai.
   The Montreal-based aviation organization assists international
civil aviation by establishing technical standards for safety and
efficiency of air navigation.
   On Thursday, a team of U.S. military experts left the gulf after
winding up a 3{-week investigation.

   A pier jammed with thousands of
people going to a festival collapsed Sunday in northwestern
Malaysia. At least 35 people were killed and 737 were injured, the
official news agency reported Monday.
   Mazlan Ariffin, deputy police chief at Butterworth, a coastal
city 190 miles northwest of the capital, said the death toll was
expected to rise because 40 of the injured were in critical
condition, the Bernama news agency reported.
   One of the injured, Jenny Ang, a 13-year-old student from
Butterworth, said, ``I managed to cling to the edge of the platform
and was helped up by a man.
   ``Below me ... I saw a whole load of people piled down ... There
was total pandemonium and chaos with people rushing to get out of
the human pile,'' she told the national news agency Bernama.
   She suffered only a slight facial injury.
   Gee Swee Cain, a 41-year-old woman who had been waiting to cross
over on a ferry to the festival, told Bernama Monday: ``Everything
happened so fast, I could only scream for help.
   ``I ... heard someone from above telling me to be patient,
because at that time nothing could be done to help me,'' she was
quoted as saying.
   Mrs. Gee was pinned under steel and timber wreckage from the
platform, suffering chest and facial injuries and a broken leg.
Many passengers fell onto the platform about 40 feet underneath.
The platform gives vehicles access to ferries and holds a port
commission office.
   Bernama said firefighters and port workers still were searching
the debris late Sunday for more bodies.
   Ariffin said a huge crowd was waiting for ferries to take them
to Penang island, about three miles across the Stait of Malacca,
for a festival when a section of the structure collapsed. The
accident occurred at 4:40 p.m.
   Syed Mohamad Aidid, chairman of the Penang Ports Commission that
operates the ferry terminal, said there usually are only 200 people
at a time on the section that collapsed. He said more than 300
people were moving across it to enter a ferry when it gave way and
that more than 3,000 people were lined up behind them.
   ``We had enough personnel to control the situation and
instructed them to allow the passengers in batches of about 200 to
300, but the crowd was too big and the platform gave way,'' he said.
   ``We were prepared to meet the massive passenger crowd and
traffic in view of the Kwan Yin festival on the island, but never
thought the section would collapse,'' he said.
   The festival, when Chinese offer prayers to the Goddess of
Mercy, or Kwan Yin, is held once every 60 years according to
Chinese tradition. Of Malaysia's 16 million people, about 4.8
million are Chinese.
   There were no reports of foreigners among the casualties.
   Thirty-five people have so far been reported dead and 737
injured in the collapse, Bernama said Monday, quoting police and
other sources.
   Ariffin said 17 bodies were recovered at the scene and 13 people
died at the Butterworth district hospital. He said 180 victims were
in the Butterworth hospital, 149 in the nearby Bukit Mertajam
district hospital, and 40 in critical condition in the Penang
general hospital.
   Another official gave somewhat higher figures. Penang state
Chief Minister Dr. Lim Chong Eu told reporters that 475 people were
involved in the collapse. He said 30 were confirmed to have died at
the scene, 391 were admitted to hospital emergency wards, and 54
received outpatient treatment.
   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir Mohamad said his government
would provide aid for the victims and would consider compensation
for their families. The section of the pier that collapsed was
about 40 feet long. Three cars entering the ferry were crushed, and
the port commission office under the platform was destroyed.
   The jetty with the pier was built in 1956 and repaired from time
to time, Bernama reported. The platform which collapsed was last
renovated in early 1986, when its planks and bolts were replaced.
   The structure was built with pillars only at the sides of the
structure and not in the center, where the section failed.
   In Kuala Lumpur, the capital, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik
told reporters that an open inquiry would be held to determine why
the jetty collapsed.

<TEXT>
   National Urban League President John E. Jacob on
Sunday lashed out at the Republican Party, saying he questioned its
claims of trying to woo black voters in this year's presidential
election.
   Jacob said at a news conference opening the group's four-day
national conference that likely GOP presidential nominee George
Bush declined an invitation to address the gathering ``just as
Ronald Reagan didn't come in 1984.''
   ``That makes you wonder about the sincerity of claims to try to
get black support in 1988,'' he said. ``It makes you wonder about
the wisdom of the advice he's getting.
   ``And it makes you wonder whether a candidate who refuses to
come to the Urban League's annual meeting will be a president who
refuses to let the Urban League come to the White House,'' Jacob
said.
   In remarks prepared for his keynote address Sunday night, Jacob
continued his criticism of the GOP.
   ``Eight years ago, Ronald Reagan rode into town and everyone but
blacks cheered,'' he said. ``Americans have now discovered why
blacks weren't waving their hats. ...
   ``Never in living memory has there been an administration whose
policies have been so insensitive to the needs of poor and working
people,'' Jacob said. ``And we remind America that more, far more,
poor people are white than black.''
   In the speech, Jacob called for racial parity by 2000, a
national job program, an early-childhood education program, welfare
reform, health care for people with no health insurance and
``aggressive national policies to protect civil rights and wipe out
the last vestiges of racism and discrimination.''
   Although critical of the Republicans, Jacob said the
organization would not endorse any candidate for the Nov. 8 general
election.
   On Saturday, Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said a scheduling
conflict prevented the vice president from accepting the
invitation. He said Bush plans to spend this week examining
potential running mates and will deliver a major foreign policy
speech in Chicago on Tuesday.
   The Urban League conference will hear from Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on Monday and Jesse Jackson on
Wednesday.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., a candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination during the early days of the 1988 campaign, will be part
of a panel discussion on the election Tuesday night. Kemp's name
has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Bush.

   Since the Israeli aggression of June 1967, it has been our
belief that our first priority should be to liberate the land and
holy places from Israeli occupation.
   We had never imagined that the preservation of the legal and
administrative links between the two Banks could constitute an
obstacle to the liberation of the occupied Palestinian land.
   Yet lately it has transpired that there is a general Palestinian
and Arab orientation towards highlighting the Palestinian identity
in a complete manner, in every effort or activity related to the
Palestinian question and its developments.
   (Jordan's maintaining links with the West Bank) contradicts this
orientation (and) hampers the Palestinian strugle to gain
international support for the Palestinian cause, as the national

   (It is the view of the PLO and Arab leaders that the struggle)

   We have to fulfil our duty and do what is required of us. We
pray God that this step be a subtantive addition to the
intensifying Palestinian struggle for freedom and independence.

<TEXT>
   It has to be understood in all clarity and without any ambiguity
or equivocation that our measures regarding the West Bank concern
only the occupied Palestinian land and its people (and) do not
relate in any way to the Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin
in the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
   National unity is precious in any country but in Jordan it is
more than that. It is the basis of our stability and the
springboard of our development and prosperity.... It is a living
example of constructive plurality and a sound nucleus for wider
Arab unity.
   Any attempt to undermine it (unity) under any pretext would only
help the enemy carry out his policy of expansion at the expense of
Palestine and Jordan alike.

<HEAD>Two More Arrested In Shooting Of Juarez Anchorwoman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more men posing as police
officers have been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths
of a television anchorwoman, her mother-in-law and friend.
   Juarez Chief of Police Fernando Mota Allen said Saturday the men
were arrested in Reynosa, Mexico, on Friday. They have not been
formally charged with the killings, but have been transferred to a
Juarez jail.
   Four other men were arrested shortly after the July 23
shootings. On Saturday, about 2,500 protesters demanding justice
solemnly marched from the shooting site to the city hall of this
town across the border from El Paso, Texas.
   XHIJ-TV anchorwoman Linda Bejarano, 28, her mother-in-law,
Lucrecia Martinez de Gomez, and a family friend Carlos Alfonso
Garcia were gunned down after men identifying themselves as federal
police stopped their car.
   Police said they shot into the car at least 47 times because
they had mistaken the Chrysler New Yorker for another car allegedly
carrying drug dealers.
   Ms. Bejarano's husband, Manuel Gomez Martinez, who survived the
shooting, has disputed the police version. He said police dragged
Garcia screaming out of the car and shot him in the head.
   An agent of the federal judicial police and three others who are
part of an illegal crew of part-time officers, called ``madrinas,''
have been charged in the slayings.
   Charged with murder are federal agent Joaquin Garcia Mendez and
three men allegedly working for him as free-lance policemen:
Roberto Gomez Silgueiro, Santos Robles and Noe Librado Zavala.
   Besides murder, other charges include abuse of power, using
machine guns permitted only for the army and acting without
authority.
   Federal District Judge Jose Librado Fuerte Chavez formally
charged the four officers Friday. A trial date has not been set.
   Charges remain pending against the two men arrested Friday. They
have been identified as Felipe Garcia Martinez, 26, and Raul
Salinas Garcia, 25. Mota said both men were carrying cards falsely
identifying them as Juarez city police.
   Each man could be sentenced to 40 years in prison if convicted,
according to Gomez's attorney, Lorenzo Holguin Cisneros. There is
no death penalty in Mexico.
   Gomez, who is also an anchor at the TV station, said at least 10
men were involved in the attack.
   Gomez led the protest march Saturday that included journalists
carrying banners with messages such as: ``We want police, not
murderers,'' ``We're reporters. Don't shoot,'' and ``Stop police
impunity.''
   Others wore T-shirts with the words: ``Please don't shoot, I'm
not a narco.'' Many were waving white handkerchiefs along the
four-mile march.
   Standing on a flat-bed trailer, Gomez asked the crowd for their
support. ``I want to invite you, when you see an injustice, protest
_ everyone here,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter what religion you
profess, or what political party you belong to, or whether you're
rich or poor.''

<TEXT>
   With civil rights activists planning a
protest this week, three white lawmen accused of killing a black
jail inmate face another round in their battle to avoid further
prosecution.
   The defendants were acquitted by a state court jury on July 15
of violating the civil rights of Loyal Garner Jr., a Louisiana
truck driver, and state prosecutors now want to try them on
first-degree murder charges.
   The defendants, former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner, 41,
and former Sabine County sheriff's deputies James ``Bo'' Hyden, 34,
and Billy Ray Horton, 58, argue that that would violate
constitutional protections against being tried twice for the same
offense.
   Garner, 34, of Florien, La., and two companions were arrested
Christmas night. Garner died two days later, after allegedly being
beaten in the Sabine County Jail.
   Ladner admitted to striking Garner on the head once with a stick
but said he only used force necessary to subdue Garner after Garner
hit him in the head and neck.
   State District Judge Joe Tunnell dismissed the defendants'
claims last month that the murder trials amount to double jeopardy.
Their appeal is to be heard in the state court of appeals here
Thursday.
   Although the three were tried together in Hemphill on the civil
rights violation charges, they face separate murder trials, with
Ladner's scheduled to start next Monday.
   Frank Henderson, an assistant district attorney for Smith
County, said he doubts the trial will start on time and that the
trials could be consolidated at a later date. The trial's venue was
changed to Tyler from Hemphill, where the civil rights case was
heard.
   While attorneys are preparing for the legal battle, Sabine
County residents are bracing themselves for a Saturday rally
sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People in Hemphill.
   Vollie Grace, president of the Sabine County chapter of the
NAACP, said he's expecting 300 to 500 people at the rally, called
to protest ``the brand and type of justice we're getting in this
area.''
   Grace said he's not expecting any violence but he has contacted
officials with the U.S. Justice Department, who told him they would
monitor the situation.
   John Hannah, who served as special prosecutor in the state civil
rights case, said he will seek federal indictments against the trio
on conspiracy to violate civil rights.
   Garner's family has sued Ladner, Hyden, Horton and Hemphill
officials over his death. The two men jailed with Garner also have
filed separate suits against the trio plus city and county
officials.

<HEAD>Abandoned Cars Remain As Shredders Try To Reach Accord On
Harzardous Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED GOLDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of abandoned cars are cluttering streets
in and around Boston amid efforts to end a dispute over hazardous
waste at two major automobile shredders.
   ``We do have a definite problem. There is a list of several
hundred cars to be towed,'' said New Bedford Police Sgt. Frederic
Anselmo. ``We're in limbo. The cars are being abandoned on side
streets and they are staying there because the 16 tow companies
working for us have suspended their operations.''
   The backup began after the voluntary closings in June of
Prolerized New England Co., of Everett, and a subsidiary, Patriot
Metals of Worcester.
   The closings came after the state Department of Environmental
Quality Engineering determined in June there were high levels of
PCBs and oil byproducts in the residue, called fluff, from shredded
cars at Patriot Metals.
   ``We since signed a limited compliance agreement on July 11 and
they are targeting the threat at both facilities,'' DEQE
spokeswoman Katie Stimmel said. ``It calls for the covering of
residue stored on site and building some kind of containment
facility.''
   But it was unclear when the two yards, which handle an estimated
350,000 cars annually, would be able to resume operation.
   Joseph Romei, general manager of Prolerized, said he hopes
something will happen soon or he may have to lay off workers.
   ``And I can't even start to assess the effects of the 900 or so
auto wreckers in the state,'' Romei said. ``Once their yards get
filled and there is no place to go with cars, there is lot of
back-up industry of material.''
   The shutdown has forced Boston officials to store about 800
cars, with even more waiting to be towed, said city Transportation
Commissioner Richard A. Dimino.
   ``We have a backlog of 1,500 out there,'' Dimino said. ``We are
getting close to capacity. ...''
   In all, Massachusetts has four major car shredders and two firms
that handle the shredding of such appliances as washing machines.
   Once a car is towed by a salvage service, a machine is used to
flatten it. Most of the oil, brake fluid and other liquids, are
removed during this phase. The metal hulk is then sold to a
shredding company, where machine-swung hammers complete the
destruction, separating the ferrous metal from non-magnetic metals
and other materials.
   ``Fifty percent of what is shaken out is plain dirt. The rest is
plastics, glass, carpeting, rubber around the windows and other
things. You can touch it and not come away with any grease or oil
on your hands,'' said Romei of Prolerized. ``DEQE said the amount
of PCB levels in the fluff was more than 50 parts per million,
meaning it was hazardous waste. But from our standpoint, the PCB
levels have always been controlled.''

   Nearly 2,000 prisoners were on death row last
year while 25 inmates were executed, both figures record highs
since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, the
government reported Sunday.
   The highest population on death row previously was 1,800 in
1986. There were 21 inmates executed in 1984, the former yearly
high.
   State courts sentenced nearly 300 people to death in 1987, while
the death sentences of 79 were vacated or commuted, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics said. A total of 1,984 men and women were on
death row in 34 states as of Dec. 31.
   Just 2.9 percent of the people under death sentences were
executed from 1976 to 1987 _ 92 men and one woman.
   During the same years, nearly 1,100 people, or 34.3 percent of
those facing capital punishment, were removed from death row.
   The 25 prisoners executed last year in eight states had spent an
average of seven years and two months waiting for the sentence to
be carried out.
   More than 60 percent of the death row prisoners were held in
states in the South, 18 percent in the West, 15 percent in the
Midweat and 5 percent in the Northeast.
   More than 57 percent of the death row inmates were white and 41
percent were black. Women represented 1.1 percent of the death row
inmates.
   All of the convicts were under a death sentence for murder,
except for a man found guilty of the capital rape of a child.
   During the period of time since the Supreme Court has reinstated
the death penalty, the FBI reported 224,400 murders and
non-negligent manslaughters and 217,120 arrests for these crimes.
   Thirty-seven states had death penalty statutes as of the end of
last year, while 13 states and the District of Columbia did not.
   About two of every five prisoners sentenced to death were in
trouble with the law at the time of the capital offense, with half
of them on parole and the remainder in prison, escaped from prison,
on probation or with charges pending against them.

   President Daniel Ortega on Sunday
urged four Central American countries to reject any U.S. attempt to
condemn or isolate Nicaragua.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz is to meet Monday with
the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa
Rica in Guatemala City. Nicaragua was not invited.
   There have been reports that the United States wants the
Guatemala City conference to issue a joint communique accusing
Nicaragua's Sandinista government of failing to comply with a
year-old peace plan for Central America and to adopt democratic
reforms.
   Ortega told reporters he hoped ``the Central American
governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the
proposal of the United States.''
   He said the United States is ``trying to escalate the war ...
with consequences for all the Central American countries, not just
for Nicaragua.''
   Nicaraguan officials expect Shultz to urge the four Central
American countries to isolate Nicaragua politically and
diplomatically.
   A Guatemalan legislator, Edmund Mulet Lesiur, said in Guatemala
that the United States is trying to pressure the four countries
into signing a virtual ``declaration of war'' against Nicaragua.
   Shultz said in Washington that a statement, which he said was
drafted mostly by the foreign ministers with whom he will meet, is
still open to discussion.
   ``We're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat,'' he
said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.'' ``Having drafted it, they
(the foreign ministers) are not so sure they want to issue it.''
   The United States has supported the Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras, who have been fighting for nearly seven years to overthrow
the Sandinistas.
   President Reagan has asked the U.S. Congress to approve
legislation that would resume humanitarian and military aid to the
Contras.

   Police used tear gas to break up a protest
rally in a town near the resort city of Acapulco and newspapers
reported Sunday that a 5-year-old boy was killed in the melee.
   The violence occurred Saturday night in Coyuca de Benitez, 23
miles north of Acapulco.
   An estimated 300 people had gathered outside the town hall to
demand the election of a mayor to replace the mayor who was killed
earlier this month in an automobile accident.
   Instead of calling a new election, the Guerrero state
legislature, which is dominated by the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, appointed party member Mario Rio Bonales as
mayor.
   Several newspapers said the boy was killed when a tear-gas
canister hit him in the face as police dispersed the demonstrators.
Government authorities said they could not confirm the death.
   In Mexico City the pro-government newspaper Excelsior, the
independent El Universal and the liberal La Jornada reported a boy
was killed but did not identify the victim.
   Jose Refugio Molineros, a police spokesman in Chilpancingo, the
capital of Guerrero state, said in a telephone interview he had
reports that a few people suffered minor injuries and two
autombiles were overturned. He placed the numer of protesters at
the town hall Saturday night at about 300 and said some 40 people
were continuing the demonstration Sunday.
   Evelia Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor's
office, also was contacted in Chilpancingo by telephone. She said
police and soliders intervened when the protesters became
``verbally aggressive,'' but she claimed no one was injured.
   Repeated attempts to reach police in Coyuca de Benitez failed.
Telephone operators said no official was available to answer
questions because it was Sunday.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday that
Jordan would remain a key partner in the Middle East peace process
despite King Hussein's vow to relinquish any control over the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Hussein's reversal Sunday, which came three months before
Israel's national elections, dealt a severe blow to Peres. He had
staked his political prestige on the ``Jordanian option'' _ peace
talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation at an
international peace conference.
   Peres, leader of the left-of-center Labor Party, played down the
importance of Hussein's announcement by saying Hussein ``committed
himself to continued involvement in the peace process.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Peres' main political rival,
suggested that Hussein's move was beneficial for Israel because it
removed the West Bank as a potential issue of contention between
Israel and Jordan. ``We have nothing to be sorry about,'' Shamir
said, referring to the king's speech.
   In his television speech, Hussein called for keeping the West
Bank separate from Jordan. He said he respected the wish of the
Palestine Liberation Organization to ``secede from us in an
independent Palestinian state.''
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, staunchly opposes an
international conference and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
territories, including the West Bank. Shamir has said he was only
willing to talk about limited self-rule for Palestinians in the
occupied lands.
   East Jerusalem newspaper editor Hanna Siniora, a Palestinian,
said Hussein's position would force Israel to start talking to the
PLO and launch ``a new chapter of cooperation between the PLO and
Jordan.''
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, saying it is a
terrorist organization.
   Hussein's speech came after he canceled a $1.3 billion
development plan for the occupied territories and dissolved
Jordan's lower House of Parliament earlier this week. Half the
legislators came from the West Bank, which Israel seized from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Hussein's announcement Sunday reversed his initial agreement to
peace talks between Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation under the auspices of an international conference.
   Such an arrangement would have helped Israel sidestep the PLO.
   Since rumors of Hussein's new policy first began to surface last
week, Peres has begun raising the possibility of separate
negotiations with Palestinians.
   Peres reiterated his new emphasis in a statement Sunday, saying:
``We are ready to talk to Jordan about peace. We are ready to talk
to the Palestinians about the Palestinian problem. We are ready to
talk to both about peace and solving the Palestinian problem.''
   Peres also said the speech did not make clear whether he
relinquished all responsibility for the West Bank.
   ``The election in Israel will determine whether the Jordanian
option is still alive,'' said a top Foreign Ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If Labor wins the election, I
can assure you Jordan and Palestinians will be willing to go to an
international conference as part of a joint delegation.''
   A spokesman for Shamir said Hussein's speech did not affect
Shamir's stance. ``We don't see any reason to change our
position,'' Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said.
   Binyamin Netanyahu, a top Likud candidate in the November
elections, said Jordan's new policy made it imperative for Israel
not to withdraw from occupied lands.
   ``Today, it has to become completely clear that those who talk
about the transfer of territory, talk about the transfer of
territory into the hands of the PLO,'' Netanyahu said in a thinly
veiled attack on Labor, which favors limited territorial compromise.

   A Church of England bishop went to Lebanon this
week to inquire into the fate of four missing Iranians in a mission
undertaken in hopes that his efforts might hasten the release of
other hostages, he said Sunday.
   Speaking to reporters Sunday after arriving in Britain, the
envoy, The Rev. John Brown, said, ``I would want to say that by
going ... I've made a contribution towards the overall picture,
which I hope will lead towards the release of all the hostages.''
   David Waite, brother of missing Church of England envoy Terry
Waite, said earlier Sunday that he hoped ``the Iranians will see
that we are doing everything on our part that we can to help
them....''
   He added, ``In turn, we obviously would like to see them do as
much as they can ... and use their influence in that region of the
world to see the release of not only my brother but all Western
hostages.''
   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking release of
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Also missing in Lebanon are British journalist John McCarthy,
kidnapped in April 1986, and teacher Brian Keenan, who disappeared
the same month. Keenan holds both Irish and British citizenship.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   At least 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, are now
missing in Lebanon. Waite and others are believed held by
pro-Iranian groups. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Christian militiamen kidnapped the Iranians in Lebanon in July
1982 during an Israeli invasion of that country. There have been
reports that they were killed, and Iran has been seeking
information on them.
   Brown, Anglican bishop in Cyprus and the Persian Gulf region,
went to Lebanon Wednesday at the request of Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, leader of the Church of England.
   He returned to his base in Cyprus on Sunday and then flew on to
Britain.
   Brown, who spoke to leaders of the Maronite Church and the
Armenian church community while in Lebanon, told reporters at
London's Heathrow Airport, ``They know who I'm talking about, and
they have promised to make inquiries of their own communities.''
   He added, ``It's very important to us when we are talking to the
Iranians ... to show them that we are concerned about their missing
people as well as ours.''
   Brown will report to Runcie on Tuesday after meeting with Runcie
aide John Lyttle on Monday, Lyttle said.
   Lyttle said the bishop was ``well guarded'' during his visit and
did not venture out of the Christian part of Lebanon.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told David Waite in a letter
released Saturday that she wants Britain to build on recent hopeful
signs in its relations with Iran.
   She called on Iran to do what it could to help free Western
hostages. However, the Conservative leader also said Britain should
make no concessions for release of hostages.

   King Hussein on Sunday called for an
independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories
and appeared to rule out the idea of Jordan representing
Palestinians in any peace talks.
   ``Jordan is not Palestine,'' the king said in a speech. ``The
independent Palestinian state will be established on occupied
Palestinian land after its liberation, God willing.''
   It was not the first time Hussein had called for an independent
Palestinian state, but it was the first time he categorically
divorced himself from Palestinians in the occupied lands and told
them to take affairs into their own hands.
   Hussein said Jordan's links to them ``hamper the Palestinian
struggle to gain international support for the Palestinian cause,
as the national cause of a people struggling against foreign
occupation.''
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday that Jordan
would remain a key partner in the peace process, despite Hussein's
vow to relinquish any control over the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Peres' main political
rival, suggested that Hussein's move was beneficial for Israel
because it removed the West Bank as a potential issue of contention
between Israel and Jordan.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Hussein's move could leave the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which claims to be the sole representative of
Palestinians, Israel's only negotiating partner in talks to resolve
the issue. Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, calling it a
terrorist organization.
   Under a recent U.S. peace initiative by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, Jordan would be partially responsible for
representing the Palestinians in peace talks. Israeli leaders had
called for negotiations with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation and said the Palestinians must not be members of the PLO.
   Shultz, speaking on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' denied the
move would pressure the United States and Israel to find a way to
talk to the PLO.
   ``We will stay right where we are. We're ready to talk to them
(PLO) when they take certain steps, which are very clear, and as
far as I can see, not too onerous. After all, Israel is there.
Israel is going to stay there. We're going to continue to support
them,'' he said.
   The speech followed moves by Hussein to give greater
responsibility for Palestinian affairs to the PLO.
   On Saturday, he dissolved the lower house of Parliament. Half
the house's members were from the West Bank. On Thursday, he
canceled a $1.3 billion development project plan for the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   King Hussein described the measures as aimed at ``enhancing the
Palestinian national orientation and highlighting the Palestinian
identity.''
   Commenting on the meaning of establishing an independent
Palestinian state, Hussein said that ``in addition to the PLO's
ambition to embody the Palestinian identity on Palestinian national
soil, (there should be) a separation of the West Bank from the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.''
   ``There the Palestinian identity will be embodied, and there the
Palestinian struggle shall come to fruition as confirmed by the
glorious uprising of the Palestinian people under occupation,'' he
said.
   The 8-month-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories has
given greater international prominence to the Palestinian cause and
increased calls for an independent state.
   Up to two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5 million population is of
Palestinian origin.
   ``We assure you that these measures do not mean the abandonment
of our national duty, either towards the Arab-Israeli conflict, or
towards the Palestinian cause,'' the king said in a 17-minute
address broadcast on national television.
   He added ``that these steps were taken only in response to the
wish of the Palestine Liberation Organization ... and the
prevailing Arab conviction that such measures would contribute to
the struggle of the Palestinian people.''
   In Israel, prominent Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini said
Saturday that Hussein was sending a clear message to both the
Americans and the Israelis with his recent moves.
   ``These steps .... mean that everything must be transferred to
the PLO and the PLO must be responsible for everything here,'' he
said. ``Hussein is sending a message that there is no Jordanian
option; there is no way but the Palestinian option through the
PLO.''
   Jordan pays $50 million in salaries to teachers, lawyers and
other employees who work in Arab institutions in the West Bank.
   The king affirmed his commitment to the ``support and asistance
for the Palestinian people until they achieve their national goals,
God willing.''
   Hussein said his country ``will not give up its commitment to
take part in the peace process.''
   ``We have contributed to the peace process until it reached a
stage of a consensus to convene an international peace conference
on the Middle East,'' the king said.

   Men whose jobs combine high psychological
demands with little control over their work face two to three times
the risk of heart attack that other male workers do, a new study
suggests.
   Cooks, waiters, computer operators, gas station attendants and
some assembly line workers were among the high-risk jobs found in
the analysis of nearly 5,000 men.
   But employers may be able to redesign high-risk jobs to lower
heart attack risk and improve productivity, said Robert Karasek,
associate professor in the industrial and systems engineering
department at the University of Southern California.
   Karasek reports the study's findings in the August issue of the
American Journal of Public Health, along with co-authors from
Sweden, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Cornell
University Medical School and Columbia University.
   The study focused on job strain, which results from having too
little control over one's work to deal satisfactorily with its
psychological demands. Those demands included having to work
quickly and facing heavy workloads.
   Executive and professional jobs were not considered high-strain
because they include a lot of control, Karasek said.
   The study was based on past heart attacks reported by men in two
federal surveys. Too few women with heart attacks appeared in those
surveys for a meaningful analysis of them, Karasek said.
   One federal study, the Health Examination Survey done in
1960-61, found 39 heart attacks among 2,409 employed men. The
other, the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, done from 1971
to 1975, counted 30 heart attacks among 2,424 employed men.
   To assess job characteristics for all 4,833 men, researchers
used federal studies of the conditions faced by workers of various
jobs. Measurements for job traits such as control over the work
were computed for 221 occupations.
   Then those measurements were adjusted for each worker based on
his age, race, education, geographic region and whether or not he
was self-employed or worked in a city.
   The study gave two sets of findings, one from each of the large
federal surveys:
   _Men whose jobs put them in the top 20 percent for job strain
had 2.48 times and 3.28 times the risk of heart attack of the other
workers. The comparison took into account their ages, which Karasek
said was the most important influence on heart attack risk, but
ignored other risk factors like smoking.
   _Men in the top 10 percent for job strain ran 3.8 and 4.79 times
the heart attack risk of men in the lowest 10 percent. Jobs in the
top 10 percent included cashiers and waiters, while those in the
bottom 10 percent included foresters, natural scientists and civil
engineers.
   This comparison took into account a list of heart attack risk
factors: age, race, cigarette use, education, blood pressure and
cholesterol levels.
   _Job strain appeared to account for between a fourth and a third
of heart attacks in the two surveys. This analysis accounted only
for age, but Karasek said the results were similar when the other
risk factors were also considered.
   The study does not prove that job strain raises the risk of
heart attacks, Karasek said, but the idea is supported by other
research.
   In this study, researchers did not know if workers were in their
reported jobs when the heart attack occurred. But it is unlikely
that a worker would have a heart attack in a low-strain job and
later move into a high-strain one, Karasek said.
   Giving workers more control has long been advocated as a means
of increasing productivity, he said. It might also reduce job
strain, along with letting workers use underutilized skills and
making their jobs platforms for learning new skills, he said.
   Karasek's results are impressive, said David Krantz, professor
of medical psychology at the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
   The ``very promising'' job strain hypothesis should be tested by
research that measures each worker's job strain directly, follows
him over time and takes the various risk factors into account,
Krantz said.

   An Indian communications satellite
launched 10 days ago from French Guiana has developed a problem in
the power system and scientists are struggling to correct it,
United News of India reported Sunday.
   It said a solar-powered component malfunctioned Friday.
   Indian scientists and a team from Ford Aerospace and
Communications Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif., are working on the
problem, according to the news agency. Ford Aerospace built the
satellite for India.
   The Insat-1C satellite was launched on July 22 aboard a European
Space Agency Ariane-3 rocket from a pad in French Guiana in South
America and was functioning normally until Friday, the Indian Space
Research Organization said.
   The 2,618 pound satellite was designed to expand television and
long-distance telephone service in India and collect meteorological
data.
   UNI said half of the satellite was connected to a power system
that was operating properly while scientists tried to repair its
malfunctioning mate.
   The problem could represent another setback for India's space
efforts. On July 13, India failed for a second time to fire into
space its own multistage rocket designed to launch satellites.

   The Paraguayan Roman Catholic church,
in a statement read Sunday at churches throughout the country, said
it is being persecuted by the government of President Alfredo
Stroessner.
   It called on the government to ``respect the fundamental rights
of human dignity.''
   On Saturday, the church announced the suspension of a Te Deum
Mass, a service of thanksgiving, that had been scheduled for Aug.
15.
   Both actions were taken in response to the expulsion last Monday
of a Spanish-born Jesuit priest, Juan Antonio de la Vega, who was
accused of advocating rebellion.
   The statement read at the Masses Sunday said in part:
   ``We recently have observed repressive acts that affect and
seriously violate the dignity of the people, such as arbitrary
arrests, limitations on freedom of expression and, once again, the
expulsion of a priest from the country.''
   The message had the title, ``A situation of persecution of the
church due to arbitrary expulsion of Father Juan Antonio de la
Vega.''
   It was drawn up by the Presbyterial Council, which represents
the country's about 800 priests.
   De la Vega, a 65-year-old theology professor, was arrested and
deported to Argentina on July 25. The government accused him of
publicly advocating the violent overthrow of the government in
comments he made at a conference on Liberation Theology.
   Church officials denied the claim and said de la Vega had been
explaining Liberation Theology, a movement that seeks political
change as a way to achieve social reform.
   The archbishop of Asuncion, Ismael Rolon, sent a note to the
government Saturday announcing cancellation of the Te Deum Mass
held annually to mark the anniversary of the Aug. 15, 1537,
founding of the city of Asuncion. This year the date coincides with
the inauguration of Gen. Stroessner for an eighth consecutive term
as president.
   Stroessner, 75, has ruled the country since he seized power in a
1954 coup supported by the armed forces and the Colorado Party. He
was re-elected to a new term, with 88.6 percent of the vote, in
elections in February. Opposition parties called the balloting
fraudulent.
   Te Deum Masses were canceled on two previous occasions in the
last 20 years _ in November 1969 and May 1972. Both followed the
government's expulsion of priests.
   A total of 21 foreign-born priests and religious workers, most
of them natives of Spain, have been expelled since Stroessner took
power.
   Catholic leaders have been frequent critics of Stroessner's
authoritarian rule.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz sets out
Monday on a 10-day visit to nine Latin American countries,
intending to discuss ways of bringing new pressure to bear on
Nicaragua's leftist government and to call attention to democratic
gains elsewhere in the hemisphere.
   The first stop is Guatemala, where Shultz will meet with the
foreign ministers of four Central American countries in an attempt
to come up with a common strategy for exerting diplomatic pressure
on Nicaragua to establish democracy.
   Shultz on Sunday said that a statement which he said was drafted
mostly by the foreign ministers of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa
Rica and Honduras is still open to discussion.
   ``We're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat. Having
drafted it, they are not so sure they want to issue it,'' Shultz
said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on
Friday, said it was unclear whether the Guatemala meeting will
result in a joint statement of principles designed to prod
Nicaragua into complying with its stated commitment to move toward
democracy.
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, said a consensus on a
common policy toward Nicaragua has been difficult to reach.
   The special U.S. envoy to Central America, Morris Busby, has
been consulting on that issue with officials from the four Central
American democracies.
   In Managua on Sunday, Nicarguan President Daniel Ortega urged
the four countries to reject any U.S. attempt to condemn or isolate
his country.
   He said the United States is ``trying to escalate the war ...
with consequences for all the Central American countries, not just
for Nicaragua.''
   Ortega told reporters he hoped ``the Central American
governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the
proposal of the United States.''
   Meanwhile, a Guatemalan legislator accused the State Department
of trying to pressure the four countries into signing a virtual
``declaration of war'' against Nicaragua.
   The legislator, Edmund Mulet Lesiur, representing a political
party known as the Union of the National Center, said President
Vinicio Cerzo rejected a demand by Busby to abandon Guatemala's
policy of ``active neutrality'' by agreeing to the document.
   Mulet said Honduras and El Salvador had agreed to sign it, while
Guatemala and Costa Rica turned it down.
   The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City issued a statement Sunday
categorically denying Mulet's statements, made in an interview with
a Guatemala City newspaper.
   ``The United States has not `pressured' Guatemala or any other
country. The United States has not asked Guatemala to abandon
`active neutrality,''' the embassy said.
   A fragile cease-fire remains in place in Nicaragua but there has
been no progress on a final settlement between the Sandinistas and
the Contra rebels. The impasse has produced calls by conservative
members of Congress for a renewal of military aid to the rebels,
   In public statements this past week, rebel leaders have
maintained that the truce has helped the Sandinistas by enabling
them to strengthen their overall military position at a time when
the Contras have been denied lethal aid from the United States.
   The administration has contended that the Sandinistas also have
stepped up internal repression since the truce went into effect
four months ago.
   In a commentary this past week in The New York Times, Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said the situation in Nicaragua
deteriorated after Congress rejected a Contra military aid request
in February.
   ``Since then, the predictable has happened: The communists have
increased repression and mocked the promises they made. And why
not, when our military support for the fighters has been halted
while Soviet arms deliveries continue?''
   Much of Shultz's trip will be devoted to highlighting the
democratic trend in the hemisphere. All of the nations on his
itinerary have elected governments and all, with the exception of
Costa Rica, became democratic over the past nine years.
   After Guatemala, Shultz will travel to Argentina, Uruguay,
Brazil and Bolivia before a return trip, lasting 24 hours, to
Central America on Aug. 8 for talks in Costa Rica, El Salvador and
Honduras.
   The trip ends on Aug. 10 when Shultz will attend the inaugural
ceremony of Ecuadoran President-elect Rodrigo Borja. While in
Quito, Shultz also will confer with President Jaime Lucinchi of
Venezuela and President Virgilio Barco of Colombia.
   Shultz has visited each country on his schedule before except
Bolivia, where officials give President Victor Paz Estenssoro high
marks for revitalizing the economy and moving decisively against
drug smugglers. In La Paz, Shultz will deliver a speech on the drug
issue.
   Abrams believes the focus on administration setbacks in
Nicaragua and Panama have deflected attention from the democratic
progress made elsewhere in Latin America.
   In his Times' commentary, Abrams wrote that throughout the 7{
years of the Reagan presidency, no Latin American democracy has
been replaced by a dictatorship.
   Pronouncing Reagan's policy an ``extraordinary success,'' Abrams
said that the United States has helped promote ``the greatest
expansion of democracy in Latin history.''

   A small blast shattered windows in a
building seized from an associate of deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos that now houses the offices of a Philippine-Soviet shipping
line, police said Sunday.
   No one was injured in the blast, which occurred Saturday night
in the city's Intramuros district.
   Police Lt. Honorato Laurel, chief of the arson division of the
Western Police District, said the blast was caused by a signal
flare thrown into the five-story building in an attempt to burn it
down.
   The building was seized in 1986 from Eduardo Cojuangco, a Marcos
associate and first cousin of President Corazon Aquino. Cojuangco
has lived in exile in the United States since the February 1986
uprising which toppled Marcos and installed Mrs. Aquino in power.
   The flare was hurled into the suite of the Fil-Sov Shipping Firm
Inc., on the fifth floor, Laurel said. The blast shattered windows
in the area but failed to trigger a major fire, he said. Damage was
minor, he added.
   Police said they had no suspects. The incident was reported
Sunday.

   One of the six Philadelphia homes of author
and poet Edgar Allan Poe was designated a National Literary
Landmark on Sunday because of its importance in the writer's career.
   Jeff Collins, acting supervisory ranger at the Edgar Allan Poe
National Historic Site, said the house is the only one remaining of
Poe's houses in Philadelphia, where he lived from 1838 to 1844.
   Poe's time in Philadelphia is considered among his most
productive, Collins said. ``Most of his famous works were published
here,'' he said.
   They included ``The Tell-Tale Heart,'' ``The Murders in the Rue
Morgue,'' ``The Gold Bug,'' ``The Pit and the Pendulum,'' and ``The
Black Cat,'' said Collins. However, it is not known whether Poe
actually composed those works while living in Philadelphia because
his manuscripts weren't dated.
   The historical site, which became part of Independence National
Historical Park in 1981, includes the house he rented and a
neighbor's house.
   The Literary Landmarks Association is a Columbus, Ohio-based
group that designates sites important to the lives of famous
authors.
   Poe was born in Boston in 1809 and died in Baltimore in 1849.

Sermon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defrocked preacher Jimmy Swaggart prayed for
cigarette-smoking followers to be delivered from nicotine Sunday,
at a service on the biblical Mount of Olives overlooking Jerusalem.
   The television evangelist told about 200 Christians visiting
from the United States and Canada that Jesus would return to the
mountain where they were seated.
   ``I don't know if I'm coming back to this hotel, and I don't
know if you'll be coming back, but I know Jesus is coming back,''
he said. The Louisiana-based preacher was speaking after a dinner
at the Intercontinental Hotel restaurant on the mount.
   After a sermon on Jerusalem's history, Swaggart called sinners
and nicotine addicts to gather around him so he could pray for
their salvation.
   ``People bound by nicotine _ you must be delivered from
nicotine,'' Swaggart said. ``There are worse things than nicotine,
but this is a place to get free.''
   Dozens of listeners raised their hands hesitantly, then stood up
and approached the restaurant's makeshift pulpit.
   ``I command the bondage to be broken... I am asking that Satan's
hold be broken,'' Swaggart said in a special prayer for smokers.
``These people belong to God...You are trespassing.''
   The evangelist said he has never smoked a cigarette in his life.
   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit last February after
confessing to an unspecified sin. A prostitute, Debra Murphee of
Indiana, later said he paid her to pose naked for him in a New
Orleans-area motel.
   The Assemblies of God denomination revoked Swaggart's ministry
credentials in May, when he insisted on returning to his
multi-million dollar ministry instead of waiting out a yearlong
suspension demanded by the church.
   About 350 American followers joined him on a weeklong tour to
Israel's biblical sites. The group arrived last Thursday.
   According to the Bible, the Mount of Olives is the site where
Jesus started his triumphal entry into Jerusalem and was later
arrested.

<HEAD>Newspaper Survey Finds Speaker's District Collects Most Federal
Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The home county of House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, collected the most federal money on a per capita
basis of any large urban area in the nation in 1986, a newspaper's
analysis found.
   The Dallas Morning News, which tracked federal spending for
fiscal years 1986 and 1987 through 50 states and 3,041 counties,
reported Sunday that Tarrant County achieved its top ranking
primarily through the awarding of multibillion-dollar defense
contracts.
   The federal government spent more than $5.5 billion, or $5,481
per person, in Tarrant County in 1986. The next year, amid a steep
decline in defense spending, the county dropped to the No. 4 per
capita position with $4.4 billion, or $4,030 per person, according
to the newspaper's analysis.
   Tarrant County's 1986-87 total was $9.9 billion, or $9,511 per
capita. The average U.S. county studied received a two-year total
of $3,577 per person for 1986 and 1987.
   Wright district includes most of Fort Worth and the suburban
cities in northwestern Tarrant County. He has represented the
district for more than three decades, and the county's high ranking
in part is a reflection of Wright's increasing influence in how tax
dollars are spent.
   Wright is unopposed for re-election this year but faces an
investigation by the House ethics committee into allegations that
he improperly interceded on behalf of troubled savings and loan
executives in Texas and that he wrongly profited from royalties on
a book.
   Wright's critics say the spending ranking only reinforces
Wright's image as a provincial, pork-barrel politician.
   ``Jim Wright generates more pork than is hanging in a Kansas
slaughterhouse,'' said Don McNiel, the Alvarado, Texas, Republican
who tried to unseat Wright in 1986. ``It's the pork barrel capital
of America.''
   ``Pork barrel is an abused and grotesquely overused word,''
Wright said in response. ``I think it's a sloppy word used
indiscriminately to belittle projects that one doesn't understand
and from which one doesn't benefit.''
   Military spending makes up the greatest slice of Tarrant
County's federal pie, with 83 percent of the $9.9 billion in funds
received coming from defense contracts. The bulk of Tarrant
County's $8.2 billion in defense contracts went to General
Dynamics, maker of the F-16 jet fighter and the county's largest
employer with 28,000 workers.
   The newspaper's analysis of federal spending in fiscal 1986 and
1987 used the Census Bureau's Consolidated Federal Funds Report,
which tracks federal spending through 50 states, 3,041 counties and
more than 80,000 local governments.
   Some federal defense funds traced to a particular county later
are funneled to subcontractors in other counties, making it
difficult to determine how much money a specific county keeps.

<TEXT>
   The governing party's first congress since
the ouster of Tunisia's founding father on Sunday endorsed the new
president and called for a confederation of North African nations.
   American officials have expressed concern the idea could greatly
extend Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi's influence in North
Africa.
   The three-day congress of the Constitutional Democratic Rally
marked a triumph for founder Habib Bourguiba's successor, President
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He was confirmed as party leader amid
enthusiastic applause of more than 2,000 delegates.
   The delegates adopted a resolution endorsing a future ``great
Arab Maghreb without frontiers.'' The congress unanimously backed
Tunisia's membership in the proposed confederation of North African
countries with Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Mauritania.
   The project has gained momentum since the recent reconciliation
between Algeria and Morocco and Tunisia and Libya.
   Such a confederation was long blocked by the Algerian-Moroccan
conflict over the disputed Western Sahara, but it became a
practical possibility following the reconciliation in May between
the two Arab neighbors.
   In addition, Tunisia broke relations with Tripoli following
Gadhafi's expulsion of more than 30,000 Tunisian workers in 1985,
but the two neighbors patched up their differences late last year.
   To promote the planned confederation, Ben Ali was due to begin a
four-day visit to Libya Friday.
   The steps planned for the group include a joint identity card
for the five participating nations.
   The party congress also confirmed Ben Ali as party president. It
thus ensured that it would retain its political preeminence, at
least in the immediate future.
   Ben Ali, 52, a former army general and Bourguiba's prime
minister, seized power last Nov. 7 after seven physicians certified
that the 84-year-old veteran leader was incapacitated by senility.
   Bourguiba formed the party he named the Constitutionalist
Socialist Party more than 50 years ago to lead Tunisia to
independence from France in 1956. It was recently renamed the
Constitutional Democratic Rally.
   Bourguiba remains under closely guarded house arrest but has not
been charged with a crime.
   At the congress opening Friday, Ben Ali promised to maintain a
``balanced political liberalism'' based on political pluralism and
a free enterprise economy.
   For the first time, leaders of the three legal opposition
parties were invited to attend a governing party congress.
   Parliamentary elections are to be held in November. Presidential
and legislative elections usually coincide in Tunisia, and Ben Ali
is widely expected to run for election in November.

<HEAD>Location Of Nancy Reagan Drug Treatment Center Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug treatment facility named for Nancy
Reagan is facing opposition from community leaders and homeowners
who don't want the center in a San Fernando Valley residential area.
   City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and Los Angeles County
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represent the area, said the center
shouldn't be located at the former Lake View Terrace Medical Center
as planned.
   At a meeting Saturday, Antonovich urged formation of a committee
to find an alternate site, saying, ``Placing a treatment center
like this in a residential community is an inappropriate decision.''
   The residential site is near an elementary school and a
convalescent home. The center would treat 150 adolescents and 60
adults.
   The Nancy Reagan Center is an attempt to take the first lady's
anti-drug crusade beyond the White House years. Wealthy
entertainment industry friends, led by Merv Griffin, have been
enlisted to help raise money.
   Lorraine Mohr, vice president of the nonprofit Phoenix House
drug service agency, which would operate the facility, said it
would benefit the community and wouldn't pose a danger to residents.
   ``The people in our program no longer want to be associated or
involved with drugs,'' she said.
   Opposition swelled when a judge decided in May to give Phoenix
House 200 days to raise the $7.7 million needed to buy the bankrupt
medical center.
   Lewis Snow, chairman of the Lake View Homeowners' Association,
said the proposal was ``the right facility in the wrong place.''
   Residents fear property values will fall and crime and drug use
among their children will rise if the drug treatment center is in
their neighborhood.

   A man awaiting sentencing for a kidnap-rape
abducted and molested two young boys and tried to abduct a girl,
police said.
   Richard E. Gardner, 21, of Weymouth, Mass., was arrested after a
high-speed car chase ended in a crash Saturday night.
   Gardner had been free on $3,000 bond after pleading guilty to
kidnapping and rape in Hingham, Mass., Rhode Island Attorney
General James O'Neil said Sunday at a news conference.
   ``I think this well demonstrates the need for bail reform,''
O'Neil said.
   Gardner was jailed Sunday night and scheduled to appear in court
Monday on numerous charges, including kidnapping, child molestation
and burglary, said Detective Capt. Roger Burlingame.
   Burlingame said Gardner broke into a Warwick house at 3 a.m.
Friday, pointed a flashlight in the eyes of a sleeping 10-year-old
boy, and forced the child to leave with him at knifepoint. Gardner
drove the child to a park, molested him and then released him,
police said.
   Later that day, police said, Gardner tried to abduct an
11-year-old girl as she left a drugstore in Bellingham, Mass.,
about 30 miles from Warwick.
   He grabbed the girl by the arm, but she broke free, and he drove
off.
   Police said Gardner returned to Rhode Island and abducted a
6-year-old boy as he and his 11-year-old brother were walking home
from a Warwick library at 7 p.m. Friday.
   Burlingame said Gardner held the boy overnight and dropped him
off at a corner near his home Saturday afternoon.
   Gardner was arrested after a police officer at the boy's house
alerted other officers by radio that the boy had been returned.
   The detective said police in several other communities want to
question Gardner in connection with abductions in those communities
within the past six weeks.

   West Germany's foreign minister said Sunday he
sought assurances from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev that new
Kremlin policies on ethnic rights will protect Soviets of German
origin.
   ``Germans residing in the Soviet Union should have a chance to
maintain their traditions, language, and also be in a position to
worship,'' Hans-Dietrich Genscher told a news conference.
   He said an existing Soviet-West German humanitarian affairs
commission would be instructed to study the Kremlin's guidelines
that would affect nearly 2 million Soviet citizens of German
descent.
   At a Friday meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee,
Gorbachev proposed measures to improve relations among the more
than 100 ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. They would include a
law declaring all languages equal and give more powers to the
country's 15 republics.
   He also said legal guarantees should be broadened to protect the
cultural rights of ethnic groups that live outside their titular
republic or who don't have one.
   A German autonomous republic in the Volga basin was abolished by
dictator Josef V. Stalin after the Nazi invasion of 1941.
   Genscher spoke with reporters at the end of a three-day visit to
Moscow that included a two-hour meeting with Gorbachev Saturday and
talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Genscher's talks also were to prepare for the visit to Moscow by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in October and for a trip by
Gorbachev to Bonn in the first half of 1989.
   The foreign minister said he and Gorbachev had discussed
international political issues, including East-West negotiations on
arms control, and bilateral West German-Soviet affairs.
   Genscher left to return to West Germany Sunday afternoon,
according to Tass, the Soviet news agency.

   Officials decided Sunday to let blazing
tank cars of alcohol derailed in a head-on freight train collision
burn themselves out while some of the 1,000 evacuees returned home
against authorities' advice.
   The crash killed two train crew members Saturday but two others
jumped to safety before the collision.
   Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board met for an
hour with police Sunday and viewed the wreckage of one of the
engines.
   ``We did not find anything out of order,'' said Edward
Dobranetski, who heads the six-member NTSB investigating team.
``The emergency brake was being applied.''
   Although evacuees were allowed to return, police tried to
discourage them.
   ``We are telling them of the dangers and leaving it up to
them,'' said Britt Adair, police chief in this suburb east of Des
Moines.
   Mayor Tim Burget said fires were burning up fuel faster than
expected and that officials were making arrangements to have heavy
equipment on hand Monday morning in hopes of beginning a cleanup.
   ``At this point, things are looking better all the time _ it
looks good at this time. We're getting confident nothing is going
to happen,'' he said.
   The fire involved two tank cars loaded with denatured alcohol.
   Glenn McDole, chief of the Polk County sheriff's patrol, said
the tank cars were still half full of alcohol Sunday evening and
flames were shooting up 15 to 20 feet, half the height of the
flames earlier in the day.
   After hazardous material experts examined the wreck Sunday,
Adair said officials decided to simply allow the fire to burn until
it ran out of fuel, a process which could take until late Monday.
   ``As long as we sit and watch it, we're in a safe situation,''
Adair said. ``If we try to mess with it we could be in trouble.''
   Officials earlier had feared that a jammed pressure relief valve
on one of the tanks could lead to an explosion, but Adair said the
inspection revealed valves on both cars working.
   ``Pressure is being relieved on both tanks,'' he said. But he
added: ``It's very dangerous, there's no question about it.''
   Adair said said the crash and derailment left the two tank cars
toppled but in a natural ravine which could deflect the impact of
any explosion.
   ``Those two cars are bunkered down in a ditch,'' he said.
   The tank cars typically carry more than 20,000 of liquid, said
Anthony Bacino, hazardous materials officer for Iowa Interstate,
owner of both trains.
   Bacino said the fumes from raw denatured alcohol are toxic and
explosive, but smoke from the burning alcohol is not hazardous.
   Security was tight at the scene. Warren Winter, a part-time
photographer for The Associated Press, said Highway Patrol troopers
confiscated his film after he slipped through barriers and took
pictures of the wreckage.
   ``I saw one fuel tanker burning like mad,'' Winter said. ``It's
a big burning mess.''
   Rail officials said the eastbound train was pulling 78 cars,
while the westbound train pulled eight. The eastbound train was
headed from Council Bluffs to Chicago, while the westbound was a
local freight going from Newton to Des Moines.
   Dobranetski would not speculate how two trains ended up on the
same track headed in opposite directions.
   ``Drug testing will be done,'' he said. ``It's required by law.''
   ``The safety board has declared this to be a major rail
accident,'' he said.
   Police swept through the area after the crash Saturday
evacuating residents, sending them to local churches and elementary
schools for the night.
   Police cars and fire engines were scattered throughout this city
of 5,700 keeping roads to the crash site sealed. Gov. Terry
Branstad toured the scene Saturday night but was kept a mile away.
   At one church where evacuees were taken, Greg Jay tried to keep
tabs on his family and a pet.
   ``It's more inconvenient than anything else. We've got three
little ones and we had to bundle them down here,'' he said.
   ``It's kind of exciting. Nothing ever happens in Altoona,'' said
evacuee Janette Fagan.

   A man thought to be a prison escapee apparently
shot himself to death while being chased by police Sunday in
suburban Cleveland, authorities said.
   Police found the body of a man believed to be Michael Cardine
inside a pickup truck after the chase ended about 12:30 p.m.
Sunday, said Lakewood Police Lt. Dan Clark. The man shot himself in
the chest, Clark said.
   Cardine, 36, escaped Saturday from the medium-security London
Correctional Institute in central Ohio in a prison ambulance after
tricking two guards and briefly taking one of them hostage, prison
officials said.
   Authorities were waiting for a positive identification from the
Cuyahoga County coroner's office sometime Monday, Clark said.
Cardine's fingerprint records were delivered to the coroner's
office Sunday to aid in the identification.
   Circumstances of the shooting indicate that the body was that of
Cardine, said Superintendent Arnold Jago at the prison about 155
miles from Cleveland.
   The pickup truck involved in the chase had been stolen in
Marysville, about 25 miles from the prison, on Saturday night,
about the same time the prison ambulance used in the escape was
found there, Clark said. Cardine was from Marysville and several
weapons were found in the pickup truck, Clark said.
   Police in suburban Rocky River spotted the truck and chased it
into neighboring Lakewood, Clark said. The truck went out of
control during the chase and ended up in a yard, he said.
   Clark said the man had shot himself by the time police
surrounded the truck, but police were not sure when the shooting
took place. No shots were fired by police, he said.
   Cardine was armed with a 9mm rifle with 15 rounds of ammunition
and a .38-caliber handgun with six rounds of ammunition when he
escaped at 6:45 p.m. Saturday, officials said.
   Cardine, an inmate at London since 1979, was serving a
22-to-70-year sentence on kidnapping, armed robbery and drug
possession convictions in Franklin, Cuyahoga and Richland counties,
Jago said.

   One hundred days before the presidential
election, Gov. Michael Dukakis has ridden a post-convention surge
to his greatest advantage of the campaign. But barring a George
Bush disaster, it won't last.
   That is the prognosis of national political pollsters, who had
expected Dukakis' leap in the polls and now predict it will
subside, at least to some extent, as the harmony of the Democratic
National Convention fades. ``The polls are accurate. The question
is, are they predictive of what will happen on election day,'' said
Harrison Hickman, a Democratic pollster. ``There is no question
that the race will tighten up.''
   For the moment, Dukakis has a commanding lead. He was ahead by
17 points in two polls last week, 18 points in two others. Survey
results just before the July 18-22 convention had ranged from a
dead heat to a slim Dukakis lead.

   New government statistics have revived the
debate over whether the evil inflation monster, which terrorized
America during the 1970s, is starting to awaken after having slept
for most of this decade.
   The Reagan administration, mindful of how voters' perceptions
will affect the presidential race, insists there are no signs that
inflation is becoming a problem. But many private economists
disagree.
   These economists contend that the 68-month economic expansion,
now the second longest of the post-World War II period, has used up
all of the economy's slack capacity.

<HEAD>UAW Begins Contract Talks With Caterpillar and Deere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's leading manufacturers of
heavy equipment head into contract talks this week, hoping to
maintain the momentum of their recent recovery in the face of
rising labor demands.
   Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co., two Illinois-based giants with
more than 30,000 union workers in seven states, will bargain with
the United Auto Workers to replace contracts expiring at midnight
Sept. 30.
   Negotiations with Deere, the giant of farm tractor and
agricultural implement manufacturing, begin way Wednesday at the
company's Moline, Ill. headquarters.
   The following day, talks begin with Peoria-based Caterpillar,
the world's leading maker of earth-moving equipment, at a St.
Louis-area hotel.
   At Caterpillar, the mood is one of cautious optimism. The
company has slugged its way out of the economic doldrums, piling up
$624 million in earnings in 1985-87 after absorbing unprecedented
losses of $953 million in 1982-84. Earnings for the first six
months of 1988 stood at $263 million on sales of $4.9 billion.
   But Caterpillar officials note that current profits are less
than half the $1.6 billion in profits achieved in 1979-81 before
the collapse.
   ``If you think happy days are here again, you're wrong,'' said
Gil Nolde, a Caterpillar spokesman. ``We aren't back where we used
to be.''
   The Caterpillar talks affect 17,553 union workers at 12 cities
in Illinois, Iowa, Colorado, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
Caterpillar employs nearly 59,000 people worldwide.
   Union workers are looking for a slice of Caterpillar's growing
profit pie, and say they deserve to be rewarded for helping the
company reclaim its strong grip on the market from competitors like
Japan's Komatsu Ltd.
   Tony Green, president of the UAW's Peoria local 974, which
represents more than 10,000 active Caterpillar workers and 1,000 on
layoff, thinks workers deserve a merit raise.
   ``Caterpillar is on the rebound,'' Green said. ``Things have
turned around and they need to reward the people who are
responsible for the profits _ the people in the shops.
   ``It's high time we had a raise other than a cost-of-living
increase. We haven't had one since 1979. We've earned it after the
years of sacrificing.''
   Green wants to see a boost in the average blue-collar wages of
$14.61 per hour, or $30,388 annually for a 40-hour week. With
fringe benefits, Caterpillar calculates its current labor costs at
$26 per hour for each employee.
   Green also wants a reduction in overtime, expansion of worker
training programs and job-security agreements that were among the
few gains the union claimed in the last two contracts.
   Those agreements resulted in frozen wages and cuts in bonuses.
The 1986 talks were extended four times before a settlement was
reached. The 1982 negotiations broke down and a record seven-month
strike ensued as Caterpillar tried to convince the union it faced
trouble after posting its best year ever in 1981 with profits of
$579 million.
   The next three years were stained with red ink. Caterpillar
closed nine plants and slashed its work force 40 percent, from
nearly 88,000 to 53,600, in an effort to survive soaring interest
rates, a strong U.S. dollar and fierce foreign competition in a
stagnant marketplace.
   ``Nobody believed Cat was in dire straits,'' Green said. ``We
were too content. Everyone suffered in the strike. We went through
hell. We're not a bunch of strike-happy nuts because no one really
wins. But we will strike if we have to.''
   Deere still is trying to rebound from a five-month strike in
1986-87, the longest in the company's 151-year history. Already
suffering from the prolonged farm recession, Deere's earnings
collapsed when socked by the strike, and the company lost $328
million in two years.
   The 163-day work stoppage at 13 Deere plants in Illinois, Iowa,
Minneapolis, Georgia, Tennessee and Colorado ended Feb. 1, 1987,
when union workers accepted a wage freeze, a one-time $735 payment
each and creation of a job-protection plan.
   Deere earnings for the first half of fiscal 1988, which ended
April 30, were $154 million on sales of $2.5 billion.
   Analysts disagree on the effects of the 1988 drought on Deere
sales and earnings, but the issue is expected to come up during the
contract talks.
   As with Caterpillar, the Deere talks also will focus on merit
increases and job security. Both sides decline to talk in detail,
but say they are confident they can achieve a settlement without a
strike.
   ``We expect to reach an agreement that satisfies the
requirements and Deere and its UAW represented employees,'' said G.
Bart Bontems, director of industrial relations for the company.
   ``United Auto Workers shares the belief with Deere & Co. that
the discussions ... will be productive,'' Jim Hecker, international
representative of the UAW.
   The average Deere factory worker makes $15.47 per hour and the
company calculates its labor costs at $26.90 per hour, including
vacation, bonuses, holidays and other fringe benefits.
   The current talks will affect about 13,400 active employees, and
4,000 laid-off workers, at 11 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
Colorado and Georgia. Deere employs about 38,000 employees
worldwide.

   The Chicago & North Western Transportation Co.
and its brakemen say it may take an act of Congress to avert a
strike idling Farm Belt boxcars and stranding thousands of
commuters.
   And lawmakers, taking the threat seriously, are considering
legislation to keep the trains rolling.
   The United Transportation Union is threatening to strike
Thursday if C&NW adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1,156
UTU brakemen.
   But neither side can act until a cooling-off period ordered by
President Reagan ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4.
   In his order _ which also blocked an April walkout and created
an emergency board to intervene in the case _ Reagan said a strike
against C&NW could deprive several Midwestern states of essential
rail service and disrupt normal business activity in the Chicago
area, where 40,000 commuters use its trains daily.
   Negotiators for the company and Cleveland-based union met last
Monday and Tuesday at National Mediation Board headquarters in
Washington but suspended their talks after making no progress.
   ``For almost two years, we've been planning how we would operate
in the event of a strike,'' said James Foote, vice president of
communications for CNW Corp. in Chicago, the railroad's parent
company. ``We're ready.''
   ``They didn't get what they wanted, so they don't intend to talk
and intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on Aug. 4,''
UTU President Fred Hardin said. ``If they take that position, that
leaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service.''
   On July 1, the presidential emergency board proposed that C&NW
eliminate one brakeman per train and the other if approved by an
arbitrator on a train-by-train basis. Both sides rejected the plan.
   Foote said it might take an act of Congress to bring a
settlement _ a sentiment echoed by Hardin. But both sides spent
last week lobbying vigorously against a bill introduced by Rep.
John Porter, R-Ill., that would make the presidential board's
recommendations binding unless the parties reach agreement without
a strike.
   The chairman of the House Energey and Commerce Committee's
transportation subcommittee, Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said the
measure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement by
Thursday.
   ``This would be a crippling strike for commuters and many
agricultural interests, especially in these drought-stricken
times,'' Luken said. ``It's premature for us to consider any action
unless and until there would be a strike, but we intend to be in a
position to move very quickly.''
   The railroad operates on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000
employees in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   It ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in revenue, generating
$893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight.
   ``We've cut our work force, cut expenses and improved our
productivity dramatically,'' Foote said. ``But because of
competition and lower rates, our revenue per car has declined 26
percent since 1982.''
   C&NW wants to save $51 million a year by cutting most of its
train crews from four to two people, eliminating what it considers
unnecessary brakemen's jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor
on board.
   ``We've made agreements in good faith with all the other
carriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and one
brakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman,'' said
Hardin, whose union represents both brakemen and conductors. ``If
C&NW were to win _ we have a strike and they're victorious _ then
they'd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads.''
   Hardin said he was not sure whether the UTU would extend a
strike to other carriers, and he did not know if C&NW employees
from 15 other unions would walk off the job in sympathy.
   ``If it's a legal strike, our people would,'' said Jim Shell,
vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in
Cleveland. ``That's a matter of personal choice, whether a member
crosses their picket lines or not, but this organization
traditionally has honored legal strikes.''
   Foote said the company is ready if all its union workers walk
out.
   ``About 80 percent of our management people have been given
assignments that they will work if there's a strike,'' he said.
``We also have a pool of approximately 8,000 former railroad
employees who will work.''
   Commuter trains would halt for the duration of the strike. But
Foote said management could operate enough trains from the first
day of a walkout to maintain about 80 percent of the railroad's
normal freight revenue, and replacement workers would be on the job
within days.

<HEAD>USW Tries Again For Democrat In White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the United Steelworkers of America
convene their biennial convention Monday in Las Vegas to take
another crack at helping put a Democrat in the White House.
   ``There's no question about the support for Dukakis,'' said Gary
Hubbard, aide to USW President Lynn Williams.
   But the USW is not as populous as it used to be _ membership has
tumbled from 1.4 million in 1976 to 650,000 now _ and there is
debate about how much influence the union leadership exerts over
its members.
   Furthermore, political analysts inside and outside the USW say
the campaign organization of Democrat Michael Dukakis is not eager
to wear a union label to the November election against Vice
President George Bush.
   Dukakis will address the Las Vegas convention Thursday in person
or by satellite video. The union will express its preference but
will not formally endorse a candidate, Hubbard said.
   The USW's contracts with most major steelmakers do not expire
until next year, and a four-year pact with the biggest producer,
USX, runs into 1890, leaving internal union business and
presidential politics to dominate the convention.
   The AFL-CIO, of which the USW is the 11th largest member, has
told its member unions to defer endorsing Dukakis until the
AFL-CIO's general board makes its endorsement in late August.
   The umbrella organization's early endorsement of Walter Mondale
during the 1984 Democratic primary hurt the presidential candidate
even before he faced Ronald Reagan, and neither Dukakis nor
organized labor wants to repeat that mistake, said Ben Fischer, a
former assistant to four USW presidents and now director of labor
studies at Carnegie-Mellon University.
   ``The people who didn't have the unions' backing...had to tar
Mondale as the candidate of special interests,'' said Fischer.
``When the Republicans do that you take it for granted. When the
Democrats start doing that you start listening.''
   Dukakis is ``trying to do this balancing rope job of on one hand
having the leadership but on the other hand not allowing too close
of an identification,'' Fischer said.
   But Hubbard disputed that an early endorsement by organized
labor necessarily was harmful.
   ``We've seen no liability from early endorsement largely because
we put forth such enormous energy in all the traditional activities
to get out the vote. That includes phone banking and door knocking.
The numbers prove the enormous participation of organized workers,
particularly steelworkers, versus unorganized workers,'' Hubbard
said.
   Dukakis is appealing directly to members ``not through
endorsements but through his support for traditional values,'' said
Ted Windt, a University of Pittsburgh communications professor and
specialist in presidential rhetoric.Windt said. ``It's a very
adroit strategy.''
   Appealing directly to union members may be more effective
anyway, Windt and Fischer said.
   ``The solidarity between the leadership and the rank and
file...doesn't mean what it did back in the 1950s or 60s,'' said
Windt. He cited the 1972 election, in which Gallup polls indicated
54 percent of families of labor union members voted for Richard
Nixon's re-election, while 46 percent voted for the Democrat,
George McGovern.
   ``That was a real crossover by the rank and file,'' Windt said.
   In 1968 Hubert Humphrey got 56 percent of the union families'
votes against 29 for Nixon, and the 15 percent that George Wallace
received ``was kind of a transition to Nixon,'' he said.
   Jimmy Carter got 63 percent of their votes in 1976 versus 36
percent for Ford, and in 1980 union households gave President
Carter only 50 percent of their votes against 43 percent for Reagan
and 5 percent for John Anderson.
   An ABC News poll indicated 45 percent of union households voted
for Reagan, and 54 percent for Mondale four years ago.
   ``It's like the deregulation of the rank and file. You've got
the rank and file doing what they damn well please,'' Windt said.

<HEAD>Economy Still Expanding In July, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy kept growing in July,
although the pace slowed slightly from the previous month,
according to a survey of corporate purchasing managers.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which
conducts a monthly survey of economic trends at more than 250
industrial companies, said its index of economic growth dipped to
59 percent in July from 59.3 percent in June.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding,
while levels below that point generally indicate the economy is
contracting.
   Production growth slowed in July, although new orders expanded
sharply, and inventories rose quickly, the group stated.
   ``The vigorous increase in new orders, undoubtedly fueled by the
surge in export orders, is impressive and signals continued robust
economic growth for the balance of the third quarter,'' said Robert
J. Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee.
   Among the purchasing managers surveyed, 31 percent indicated
their new orders had expanded, compared with 34 percent in June,
while 12 percent said their rate of new orders was worse, the same
as in June.
   Of the 70 percent of the group's members that export, 39 percent
reported higher export orders during July, up from 38 percent in
June, while only 3 percent said export orders were worse, the same
as in the previous month.
   Production slowed for 13 percent, compared with 12 percent in
June, and increased for 25 percent, down sharply from 35 percent in
June.
   Inventories grew rapidly, with 22 percent of the purchasing
managers reporting higher inventories, compared with 18 percent the
previous month, and 18 percent reporting a slowdown in inventory
growth, compared with 22 percent in June.
   The group said that accounting for normal seasonal variations,
the rate of inventory increase was the greatest since July 1984.
   ``Some of the increase in inventory may be attributed to
receiving products earlier than required from suppliers who closed
their plants for vacation and maintenance and as a hedge against
the significant number of price increases that went into effect
July 1,'' the group stated.
   In other areas:
   _Prices rose for the 22nd consecutive month, although the number
of managers reporting higher prices declined. Some 63 percent
reported higher prices, compared with 66 percent in June, while 2
percent reported lower prices in both months.
   _Employment rose for the second straight month after falling for
three straight months. Nineteen percent of those surveyed indicated
their employment rose, compared with 20 percent the previous month,
while 12 percent indicated employment fell, compared with 16
percent in June.
   _Vendor deliveries slowed in July, a sign of economic growth
that indicates demand for materials is outpacing manufacturers'
ability to fill orders. Some 21 percent indicated deliveries from
their vendors had slowed, compared with 32 percent in June.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is a trade
organization representing 30,000 purchasing managers in 21
industries.

<TEXT>
   Pullman Co. has agreed to $650 million buyout by
the investment firm Forstmann Little & Co., dropping an earlier
agreement for a takeover by a managment-led group, Forstmann Little
announced Sunday.
   The firm, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, stated it
would pay $9.25 cash per share for Pullman's 41.9 million
outstanding shares, or about $387.57 million. Assumption of
existing debt and expenses will make the total price of the buyout
about $650 million, Forstmann Little stated.
   The buyout was conditioned on Pullman terminating its earlier
agreement for a $7.75 per share buyout by a group led by Thomas M.
Begel, the company's chairman and chief executive, and Henley
Manufacturing Corp., Pullman's biggest shareholder with 9 percent
of the company's outstanding shares.
   Pullman stock closed unchanged at $9 a share Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   ``I am pleased that Pullman's stockholders will get the benefit
of the $9.25 transaction price and am confident that by being one
of the Forstmann Little group of companies, new opportunities will
be provided for Pullman's employees,'' Begel said in a news release.
   Pullman, based in Princeton, N.J., is a diversified manufacturer
of industrial and engineered component products, including truck
trailers, aircraft seating, food service equipment, weapons systems
components, refuse disposal equipment and fluid handling systems.
   ``The acquisition of Pullman is an opportunity for Forstmann
Little to purchase a well-managed diverse group of industrial
businesses, which have strong niche market positions,'' said
Nicholas C. Forstmann, a general partner of Forstmann Little.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with money raised by the target
company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   The Begel group had planned to sell a number of Pullman's
businesses and divisions to pay off debt incurred in its buyout.

<HEAD>Official: Airbus Reforms Will Be Topic of September Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top West German economic official
said Sunday that reduction of government subsidies for Airbus
Industrie will be a main topic at a planned September meeting of
the consortium's member nations in Britain.
   Erich Riedl, parlimentary state secretary for the Economics
Ministry, said in a radio interview that Bonn also would push for
the naming of a West German as financial director to oversee the
consortium's expenses.
   The other Airbus nations are Britain, France and Spain.
   Riedl said reforms were necessary ``to ensure that aircraft
production also remains competitive.''
   Riedl's comments came a day after West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Economics Minister Martin Bangemann met to
discuss subsidies to the Airbus program in the context of the
proposed sale of aerospace holdings to industrial giant
Daimler-Benz. Details of Saturday's talks were not released.
   Daimler wants to acquire a 30 percent holding in the
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm aerospace group.
   Goverment officials said before the meeting that the talks were
aimed at reducing the government's involvement in Messerschmitt's
Deutsche Airbus division and to increase private industry's
commitment to the national aerospace industry.
   Deutsche Airbus is the West German participant in the Airbus
Industrie consortium.
   The West German government already has committed billions of
dollars to Airbus already and wants to limit the amount of future
subsidies. Stoltenberg, facing budget constraints, is eager to
prevent additional costs.
   Furthermore, U.S. officials and aircraft makers have complained
that the subsidies to Airbus amount to unfair competition and hurt
U.S. manufacturers, and are pressuring Airbus nations to limit
their subsidies.
   Daimler-Benz is interested in expanding its aerospace
activities, but wants protection against Airbus risks.
