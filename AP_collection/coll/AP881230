   Jim and Tammy Bakker begin broadcasting a
new television show from their living room Monday for at least six
independent television stations across the nation, according to a
published report.
   Bakker and three of his associates were indicted this month on
charges of misusing millions of dollars in PTL funds. Bakker could
not be reached for comment Thursday.
   The Charlotte Observer in Friday's editions quoted unidentified
sources as saying that the live broadcasts from the Bakkers' living
room near Pineville will be carried on stations in Albany, N.Y.;
Atlanta; Chico, Calif.; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; and San Diego.
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms of Hendersonville, N.C., said in a
telephone interview Thursday night that the Bakkers had been
preparing to return to television, but could not confirm when the
return would take place.
   Bakker has not had a regular TV show since he resigned from PTL
in March 1987 after widely publicized allegations of his 1980 sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and payments to keep
her quiet.

   A woman says she read a prayer book and
somehow managed to stay calm while trapped nearly 18 hours in a cold
elevator at the high school where she works as an accountant.
   ``I thought it would be nice at one point to scream, rant and
rave, but that would not get me anywhere,'' Gretchen Forrester, 58,
said Thursday.
   ``So I took out my rosary and started praying. I had a beautiful
prayer book with me that I read most of the night. I didn't sleep.''
   Finally, at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, Charlie Mann, interim
superintendent of buildings and grounds at Wayland Academy in this
southeast Wisconsin city, asked Forrester if she was in the elevator.
   ``And I said, `Yes, Charlie, get me out of here,'' she recalled.
He did.
   Forrester was going to her office in a new building at the
private school when she stepped into the elevator around 1 p.m.
Tuesday.
   ``The elevator didn't move, but the door wouldn't open,'' said
Mann.
   ``I rang the bell, I rang the bell, I rang the bell, and it
didn't do me any good,'' Forrester said. ``From 1 p.m. to about 4:15
p.m. I rang the bell about every 15 minutes or when I heard a noise.
After 4:30, I figured no one was coming.
   ``Hypothermia crossed my mind,'' she said. ``It was so cold. I
had my coat on and my gloves. ... I used my purse to block vents in
the walls where cold air was coming through.''
   She kept ringing the bell. And she prayed.
   ``My faith kept me going and kept me calm,'' Forrester said.
   Forrester was found after a police officer told a cleaning woman
at the school that a buzzer had been going off at the new building,
Mann said.

<HEAD>Religion Writers Vote Swaggart Scandal Top Story Of 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defrocking of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
after he allegedly paid a prostitute to pose naked and talk dirty
was the top religion story of 1988, says a national poll of religion
writers released today.
   Swaggart was also picked as the religion newsmaker of the year in
the poll of the Religion Newswriter Association's 200-plus active
members, who write for newspapers, magazines and news services.
Forty-three members responded.
   Swaggart stayed out of the pulpit for three months after
tearfully confessing to an unspecified sin. But he refused to accept
a one-year suspension imposed on him by the Assemblies of God
denomination and resigned from the ministry the day his defrocking
was announced in April.
   Another television evangelist, Jim Bakker, also figured in the
news in 1988, but his indictment this month by a federal grand jury
on charges he misused millions of dollars from his PTL ministry came
too late in the year to be included in the poll.
   The protest campaign against showings of the controversial movie
``The Last Temptation of Christ'' ranked second in the poll.
Evangelical and fundamentalist Christians denounced the film as
blasphemous.
   Third was the election of Barbara Harris as suffragen (assistant)
bishop of the Massachusetts Episcopal Diocese, making her the first
woman bishop in the worldwide Anglican Communion.
   The other top 10 religion stories, in order, were:
   _ Two religious leaders, Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson, wage
aggressive but unsuccessful campaigns for presidential nominations;
George Bush elected with support from the religious right.
   _ Reform policies help ease some religious restrictions in the
Soviet Union as celebrations marking the millennium of Christianity
there are attended by spiritual dignitaries from 100 nations.
   _ Scientific tests find the Shroud of Turin, long venerated as
the burial cloth of Jesus, to be medieval in origin.
   _ The Operation Rescue anti-abortion group sponsors
demonstrations blocking entrances to abortion clinics, with some
2,000 protesters arrested in 27 cities.
   _ Rebel Roman Catholic Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre consecrates
bishops in defiance of Rome and is excommunicated.
   _ The National Council of Churches, in a financial crisis, calls
for another reorganization and hints at forming a broader ecumenical
structure including Roman Catholic and evangelical churches.
   _ Orthodox Jewish religious parties demanding controversial
amendment to the Law of Return appear to hold balance of power after
election in Israel.
   The poll was conducted by Willmar Thorkelson of Minneapolis, a
past president of the Religion Newswriters Association.

<TEXT>
   Other labor leaders shun Eric Hammond and
he rivals Margaret Thatcher as a hate figure for the left, but many
see the maverick union boss as a natural product of the prime
minister's age of enterprise.
   Hammond is the polecat of organized labor, particularly since his
electricians' union was expelled from the national labor federation,
and he appears to enjoy the role.
   His eyes twinkle as he lauds laws that have emasculated the
once-mighty labor movement since Mrs. Thatcher and her Conservative
Party won power in 1979.
   ``I'm only half-joking when I say we'll be erecting statues to
the Tories before the end of the century,'' he said. ``Why? Because
they will have saved the trade union movement from itself.''
   Labor legislation in the Thatcher decade has outlawed sympathy
walkouts, forced secret-ballot membership votes before strikes are
called and empowered employers to sue unions for damages resulting
from illegal strikes.
   A revolution was wrought in British working practices, and
Hammond's 360,000-member Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication
and Plumbing Union joined it.
   In his office at the union's elegant headquarters, a converted
mansion in commuter country 10 miles from London, Hammond continues
the union-baiting that got him banished from the Trades Union
Congress, the 9 million-member British labor federation.
   He is accused of splitting organized labor, making cozy no-strike
deals with employers, invading the territory of other unions and,
through a 1986 deal with publisher Rupert Murdoch to run his
high-technology presses, breaking the power of newspaper production
unions.
   Hammond, 59, is a sharp contrast and constant provocation to
left-wing leaders of old, traditional unions: Arthur Scargill and
his National Union of Mineworkers, for instance, and the huge
Transport and General Workers Union with its 1,250,000 members.
   ``Hard times have been forced upon the unions and the way Eric
Hammond has tried to solve this is through sweetheart deals with
employers,'' said Andrew Murray, an official of the transport union.
   ``A strike is always a weapon of last resort. The question is
whether union officials have the right to surrender that resort.''
   In September, the Trades Union Congress expelled Hammond's
electricians for refusing to abandon single-union, no-strike deals
with a Japanese electronics company in Wales and a British food
chain.
   Hammond, unrepentant, delivered his credo in a final speech to
the federation's annual conference and walked out before the
expulsion vote was taken.
   ``Our members,'' he thundered, ``reveal an enthusiasm for the
market system and its values and infuriate the sherry-party
revolutionaries with their model resolutions and conference-hall
rhetoric.''
   He is negotiating a merger with the Amalgamated Engineering
Union, which has 800,000 members and is the nation's second largest
after the transport workers.
   If that goes through next year, the Trades Union Congress must
either take the electricians back in their new form or risk the
emergence of a rival federation of the highest-skilled workers.
   Although Hammond is isolated, at least for now, he sees himself
as the smart kid on the block, the adapter to modern realities in a
bleak time for organized labor.
   Membership in unions belonging to the Trades Union Congress has
declined from nearly 13 million to under 9 million since 1979.
Nearly 50 percent of British workers belonged to unions then, but
only 35 percent do now.
   Hammond's background is impeccably working class. He is the son
of a paper-mill timekeeper, grew up in a modest home at Gravesend,
20 miles east of London, and became an apprentice electrician at 16.
   He began as a leftist, he said, but moved right.
   Communists took over the union but were kicked out in a 1962
ballot-rigging scandal and the right has controlled it since. Frank
Chapple, Hammond's Cockney predecessor, was the scourge of the left
in the socialist Labor Party, which unions founded and finance.
   Chapple, now a life peer sitting in the non-elected House of
Lords, warned his many enemies in the Tredes Union Congress when he
retired four years ago: ``You think I'm right-wing? Wait till you
see Eric.''
   Experience bore him out.
   Hammond has excoriated the London Labor Party for, as he put it,
consorting with ``terrorists, lesbians and other queer folk.''
   He has pushed single-union deals, with or without no-strike
clauses that stipulate binding arbritration.
   Unions have made more than 30 such arrangements, mainly with
Japanese electronic companies _ often after several unions vie to
offer managers the most attractive package.
   Hammond's alliance with Murdoch revolutionized the newspaper
industry in less than two years. When Murdoch fired 5,000 production
workers in January 1986 for striking against new high-tech
machinery, Hammond and his electricians moved in to run the presses.
   With the production unions vanquished, the rest of the national
newspaper industry quickly followed suit.
   ``The other unions were demanding jobs for life ... and Murdoch
said, `Get lost','' Hammond said in the interview. ``I don't see how
we could have acted any differently.''
   ``These deals are what our members want, and that's what it's all
about _ membership. We're operating in a tough environment.''

   A nation known for its squeamishness about sex is
paying for its prudishness with rampant divorce and abortions, and
an increasingly frustrated and puzzled populace, a Soviet sex expert
says.
   Despite a spirit of openness and a freer discussion of once
sensitive subjects, philosopher Igor S. Kon believes the Soviets
desperately need to engage in some frank banter about the boudoir.
   ``Things that newspapers in the West already are writing about,
and which even have become sensations, aren't even known by
specialists here,'' said the 60-year-old doctor of philosophy.
   Although the social chill on discussing sex is thawing a bit, sex
is still a taboo topic in a country known for its puritanism, where
even the Russian language lacks a polite word for love making.
   On a recent televised discussion between panels of Soviet and
U.S. students, the Americans spoke freely about the problems of
teen-age pregnancy and other sex-related subjects.
   But when an American asked whether there were similar woes in the
Soviet Union, the half-joking answer was: ``We don't have sex.''
   Evidence points to the contrary in this nation of nearly 285
million people, however. Western specialists say Soviet women
average nine abortions, and the number of AIDS cases, while small,
is growing.
   Such problems makes it necessary to deal openly with sex, said
Kon, who is trying to take President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost _ or openness _ behind the bedroom doors.
   ``If we don't do anything ... we will create new difficulties.
The stability of marriage will suffer,'' he said at a recent lecture
to an overflow crowd at Moscow's House of Actors.
   Kon recently returned from a 3{-month stay in the United States,
where he visited AIDS clinics and family planning centers. He told
his audience that the Soviet Union is far behind the West in
discussing sex.
   His frank talk goes against the mainstream, and his comments
raised many eyebrows among an audience that ranged from young men
and women clad in jeans to people in their 80s.
   With little poll data available to judge the Soviet public's
attitude toward sex, the audience's questions offer some clues. Most
expressed concern over a perceived rise in pornography and
homosexuality.
   But Kon said he does not consider recent sexually explicit Soviet
movies to be pornographic and told the audience that homosexuality
is natural for some people.
   He noted that right-wingers in the United States once condemned
sex education as ``a communist plot.'' But he said that sex
education is desperately needed in this bastion of communism.
   Kon blamed Soviet authorities for the public's ignorance about
sex and the resulting health and family problems.
   ``If a woman comes into a clinic, even a solid one in Moscow, and
asks how to become pregnant, they will tell her,'' Kon said in his
lecture. ``But if she asks how to receive pleasure from this, they
will say `We can't help you, it's not our speciality.'''
   Traditionally, Soviet women are expected only to be good mothers
and housewives.
   ``Sexual pleasure was considered not important to marriage,'' he
said. Today, however, Soviet women are demanding happy sex lives.
   There have been some changes, however.
   This year, after a 10-year struggle with censors, Kon's book
``Introduction to Sexology'' was finally published in the Soviet
Union. A new book, which he says will include illustrations of
sexual positions, is slated for publication early next year.
   Sex clinics have been opened in several Soviet cities and the
Health Ministry is beginning to realize that AIDS, the high rates of
divorce and abortions cannot be reduced without the help of
psychologists and sociologists, Kon said.
   This year, the Health Ministry newspaper Meditsinskaya Gazeta
decried a chronic shortage of condoms and printed a reader's letter
saying some people were so desperate they were using balloons as a
substitute. The same newspaper called for repeal of the law making
homosexuality a crime.
   Although Kon's talk was largely philosophical and he did not
provide many specific sex tips, one woman confided to a friend
afterward:
   ``If I had known this before, I'd be a normal person now.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in one of
his last official acts, will undertake an international effort next
week in Paris to roll back the proliferation of chemical weapons
technology.
   He will represent the United States at a multinational conference
in the French capital that is expected to reaffirm a 1925 protocol
banning the use of chemical weapons and to encourage completion of
negotiations among 40 nations in Geneva of a new agreement
prohibiting production.
   Some 20 nations, by U.S. estimate, either have produced chemical
weapons or are capable of manufacturing them. Among them the State
Department includes Libya, whose leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is accused
by the department of supporting terrorism.
   Libya ``is one of the more recent ones, and one of the more
irresponsible ones'' to reach the edge of production, said a U.S.
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At one time, the civilized world abhorred poison gas. But Iraq
discovered in the Persian Gulf war that chemical weapons were
effective against numerically superior Iranian forces. And some
Third World countries resent interference with their chemical
industries.
   The United States stopped production in 1969, then resumed 17
years later on the grounds the Soviet Union and other potential
adversaries had chemical weapons programs. Currently, chemical
components and artillery shells to contain them are being produced
but stockpiled separately.
   President Reagan proposed the Paris conference in a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly last September. President-elect Bush said
during the election campaign in October that the United States must
take the lead in making sure that nations using chemical and
biological weapons are punished.
   ``The barriers against chemical warfare, breached as we've seen
during the Iran-Iraq war, must be repaired and raised even higher,''
he said. Bush vowed to make nations that use such weapons ``pay a
price.''
   Realistically, though, the 1925 protocol, to which 130 nations
are parties, has no enforcement provisions. Iraq, which denied using
the weapons, is one of them.
   Bush proposed a global ban in 1984 while twice casting
tie-breaking votes in the Senate to continue financing U.S.
production. An aide explained that Bush felt that as long as the
Soviets produced chemical weapons the United States should keep up.
   The Soviet Union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemical
weapons, then claimed to have ceased production. A foreign ministry
spokesman said 50,000 tons would be stored, the rest destroyed.
   Officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in Geneva
to plan ways to restrict proliferation.
   So far, the United States and the Soviet Union are the only two
countries in the world to admit possessing chemical weapons.
   But in recent weeks the Reagan administration has accused Libya
of having a chemical weapons plant. Reagan, in a recent television
interview, said the government has not ruled out a military strike
against the plant.
   The Paris conference is expected to reaffirm the 1925 ban on
using the weapons and to urge adoption of a verifiable ban on
production, as well, by the 40-nation disarmament conference that
meets in February in Geneva.
   Two other steps may be taken in Paris: authorizing the
secretary-general of the United Nations to investigate allegations
of the use of chemical weapons, and some form of assistance for
victims.
   Nearly all the 159 nations that are members of the United Nations
are sending their foreign ministers or ambassadors to Paris. ``You
can expect an enormous turnout,'' said the U.S. official, who is
involved in preparations for the Jan. 7-11 conference.
   Whatever declaration emerges, there is no way to enforce it,
although sanctions may be discussed. And, the official said, ``there
is a great allergy, particularly in the Arab world, to pointing
fingers at their capabilities and their emerging capabilities. So
that becomes a bit sensitive.''
   Assuming the 40 nations in Geneva, which do not include Iraq and
Libya, decide to ban the production and possession of chemical
weapons, there still will be an enormous problem.
   ``We recognize that verification is a very complicated problem,''
the official said. ``When you are talking about not producing
chemical agents, that raises all kinds of very difficult issues. Any
chemical industry which can produce pesticides to kill insects can
probably produce chemical agents to kill people. And that's one of
the frightening parts of this whole business. They are relatively
simple to construct and to make.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
restructuring drive eventually may enable Soviet computer makers to
satisfy demand, but progress will be slow and Moscow can be expected
to keep trying to acquire Western technology, a U.S. scientific
advisory panel says.
   It said the United States should take a more focused and flexible
approach to export controls on computers, especially since the
existing curbs on many components and systems have become virtually
unenforceable.
   The panel urged the United States to concentrate instead on
striving _ together with its NATO allies and Japan _ to control
leakage to the Soviet bloc of militarily valuable supercomputers and
the most advanced computer manufacturing processes.
   ``The United States cannot afford to be complacent about its
computer technology strengths or base export control decisions on an
assumption of an invincible lead,'' said the National Research
Council report released Thursday.
   Preparing the 288-page study was a 17-member committee chaired by
Seymour E. Goodman, professor of management information systems and
policy at the University of Arizona, Tucson.
   The National Research Council is the principal operating agency
of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering.
   The report estimated that the Soviet Union lags about five years
to 10 years behind the West in many computer technologies.
   ``The lag between East and West is now large enough that the
acquisition-diversion of certain Western technologies for direct
production will help the Soviets tremendously,'' it said.
   Referring to Gorbachev's perestroika or restructuring drive, the
report said that ``if perestroika actually fails to bring about
fundamental changes in the Soviet economy, collection efforts will
surely increase.
   ``On the other hand, if perestroika succeeds, the Soviet
computing industry may finally find itself in a position to fully
meet demand, and the Soviet military may find itself getting the
same kind of support from its own computing industry that it now
must get by using the Western computer industry as a surrogate,'' it
said.
   But the report added that ``the full effects of perestroika will
be a long time coming, and transformation of the Soviet computer
industry cannot happen overnight. In the meantime, the acquisition
of Western technology would seem to appear even more attractive to
the Soviet computer industry as it tries to close the gap.''
   On U.S. export controls policy, it noted that ``as the computer
market becomes increasingly global, U.S. firms face increasing
foreign competition, mostly from firms operating with fewer export
barriers under the same CoCom guidelines.''
   CoCom is the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls, comprising the United States, Japan and all NATO countries
except Iceland.
   ``Tighter U.S. controls may reflect the absence of a fully
effective multilateral control effort, but there is a risk that in
the computer area, the United States may lock the proverbial barn
door after the horse has escaped,'' the report said.
   It concluded that ``current technological progress will make
controls harder to enforce, and technological and market
developments combine to make a case for a more focused and flexible
control process.''
   Increasingly powerful computer hardware and software, the study
said, are in effect becoming commodities in world trade.
   ``Commodity products are available in high volume and at low
cost, they may be available in multiple and substitutable forms, and
they tend to be small and easy to transport,'' it said. ``These
attributes make commodities vital to the economic health of the
computer industry, but also effectively uncontrollable.''
   The report recommended that the United States publish a list of
computer technologies that are commodities. The government then
should promulgate a policy exempting such commodities from export
controls, at least for trade among CoCom nations.
   On the other hand, it said, the State Department should work with
other agencies to focus export control efforts on ``computer
technologies of compelling military importance'' that could enable
Soviet bloc countries to make substantial gains in their technology
base.
   In particular, the report cited advanced chip fabrication lines,
supercomputers and other high-performance computing systems,
computer-aided design systems, and magnetic and magneto-optical
materials.
   The study also said the United States should involve newly
industrializing countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
South Korea into the CoCom program.

<HEAD>A Guru By Any Other Name Would Be Just As Divine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   You can call him Shree. And you can call
him Rajneesh. But Oregon's former self-styled guru of wealth and
free love, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, says until further notice that
you don't need to call him God.
   Rajneesh announced Thursday he has dropped the honorific title of
Bhagwan, a Hindi word meaning God.
   Many Indians resented Rajneesh calling himself Bhagwan because,
in Hinduism, no mortal is equal to God.
   ``I have been calling myself `Bhagwan' just as a challenge to
this country,'' the 57-year-old who once taught philosophy in India
said in the statement from his new commune in Poona, western India.
   ``I don't want to be called `Bhagwan.' Enough is enough. The joke
is over,'' he said.
   Rajneesh was deported three years ago from the United States
after he pleaded guilty to immigration fraud and closed his
64,000-acre commune of Rajneeshpuram in central Oregon. Followers
had bestowed dozens of Rolls Royces on their revered guide of
Eastern religion, pop psychology and free love.
   After roaming in search of a new sanctuary for a claimed 500,000
faithful worldwide, he moved his cult to a six-acre commune in
Poona, a city of nearly 1 million residents about 80 miles southeast
of Bombay.
   But despite Thursday's announcement, the guru did not entirely
renounce claims to divinity.
   He told 10,000 people in Poona, ``From today onwards, you can
look at me as `Gautama the Buddha.' And by accepting Gautama the
Buddha as my very soul, I go out of the Hindu fold completely.''
   Gautama Buddha, born in India about 500 B.C., renounced a title
too. Born a prince, he gave up nobility to launch a new religion _
Buddhism.

   While a nearly all-male club is
making its annual New Year's Eve trek up 14,110-foot Pike's Peak, a
group of women will be making a 1,000-foot ascent of a nearby
mountain in jest of the traditional event.
   This year's climb will mark the 66th annual climb of Pike's Peak
by the AdAmAn club, which plans to set off fireworks at the summit.
The group adds a climber each year.
   AdaWoman, a band founded in 1982, will make an ascent on Pyramid
Mountain in Ute Pass west of Colorado Springs, light sparklers, play
Helen Reddy's song ``I Am Woman,'' down champagne and head home for
the night, organizers said.
   It will be the seventh climb for the AdaWoman club, which was
founded almost as a lark by Rita Randolph and several other woman
who train on Pyramid Mountain.
   ``It's really beautiful up there, and one morning we had run the
mountain and decided this was the way we should start out the new
year together,'' she said.
   The women also were prodded that year because AdAmAn, for the
first time in its history, was inviting a female guest, veteran
climber Sue Graham.
   ``One of the AdAmAn members said that the reason they hadn't done
it before was they didn't know any women who could make it,'' said
Randolph. ``Well, I and another of our members ran the Pikes Peak
Marathon, so I think we can make it.''
   AdAmAn historian Jim Bates said Graham, still the only woman
invited, will make her fourth climb with the club this year.
   ``Of course, when we started this climb in 1922, you couldn't
have hired a woman to go with us. It wasn't until a few years ago
that women got so they were into this type of thing,'' he said.
   Randolph said AdaWoman may add a man in 50 or 60 years, if one is
found worthy.

   City Council showed a little belated Christmas
spirit when it agreed to tear up 800 parking tickets issued Monday
to many car owners who thought it was a holiday.
   City Councilman Joe Giarrusso argued Thursday for giving auto
owners the benefit of the doubt. City Attorney Okla Jones countered
that the Streets Department had done nothing it wasn't authorized to
do.
   Several people cited for expired parking meters downtown and in
the tourist-loaded French Quarter said they thought the day after
Christmas was a ticket-free holiday.
   Jones said that Monday was a city government holiday not a public
holiday, which would have been ticket free.
   Streets director Betty Jo Everett said she gets tired of
defending the city holiday policy to irate drivers.
   ``We didn't gear up and lick our chops and think that we really
had something to go for,'' Everett said. ``It was just a normal
working day.''

   More Americans are once again calling the
Midwest their home, but Sunbelt states like California and Florida
remain the favored places to settle down, government figures show.
   The Census Bureau on Thursday released its 1988 population
estimates, showing that the West and parts of the South continued
strong population growth, while smaller growth rates were reflected
in the Northeast.
   The Midwest appeared to be rebounding after a dropoff in
population during the early part of the decade.
   The total U.S. population stood at 245.8 million as of July 1,
the date of the 1988 Census statistics, reflecting a 3 percent
increase in population from July 1, 1985.
   Over the three-year period, the biggest growth rate and
population loss were seen in small population states: Nevada was up
12.8 percent, topping the 1 million mark for the first time; and the
energy-producing state of Wyoming had a 7.6 percent decline, a loss
of 39,000 people, leaving its population at 471,000.
   The 12 Midwestern states _ where the depressed farm economy
caused a population downturn between 1981 and 1983 _ had an overall
1.2 percent population increase in the 1985-88 period, the Census
estimates showed.
   Some Midwestern states continued to lose residents, but the
Midwest as a region picked up slightly.
   Losses were estimated in 1985-1988 for Iowa, Nebraska, North
Dakota, Montana and Idaho, the Census Bureau said in a statement,
but added, ``The 1988 data indicate that the declines may be
slowing, and several of these states may have grown in the past
year.''
   The largest state, California, had the greatest increase in
population, 1.8 million people, or 6.9 percent, boosting its total
to 28.2 million.
   Other states that showed strong growth rates over the three years
were: Arizona, 9.6 percent, bringing its total to 3.5 million
people; New Hampshire, 9.9 percent, to 1.1 million residents;
Florida, 8.9 percent, to 12.4 million people; Georgia, 7.1 percent,
to 6.4 million; Maryland, 5.7 percent, to 4.6 million; and Delaware,
5.4 percent, to 660,000 people.
   Eleven states and the District of Columbia lost population during
the three years: Iowa, North Dakota, Nebraska, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Alaska.
   In the regions outside the Midwest, the government found that
population increased by 1.5 percent in the Northeast, including the
New England and Mid-Atlantic states; by 3.7 percent in the South;
and by 5.5 percent in the West, including the Mountain and Pacific
Coast states.
   Florida, the Sunshine State, continued to attract residents, with
a population growth rate of 8.9 percent. That boosted its population
to 12.4 million.

   West Germans, who lead the world in
per capita consumption of beer, will be getting a guarantee of
freshness next year with every brew.
   Beginning Jan. 1, the nation's 2,500 breweries must stamp a
freshness date on each container and guarantee the product's quality
until that time, the Bavarian Interior Ministry announced Thursday.
   Brewers violating the new consumer protection code could face
fines of up to $14,700, the ministry reported.
   Bavarians, who make up nearly 20 percent of West Germany's
population, consume an average of 57 gallons of beer yearly _ more
than a gallon each week, the most in their country.

<HEAD>Provincial Court Bans `Falcon Crest' Show As Immoral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A provincial court has ordered the television
series Falcon Crest off Egyptian TV on grounds it undermines public
morals, according to a newspaper report.
   Falcon Crest began appearing several years ago on local
television and quickly became a favorite among both poor and wealthy
Egyptians, despite its depiction of a society generally foreign to
the mostly conservative Egyptians.
   Television censors, for example, routinely cut kissing scenes
from Falcon Crest that they consider too passionate.
   The TV series Dallas, a predecessor of Falcon Crest, also was
widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of
parliament complained it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian youth.
   The newspaper Wafd, published by a centrist opposition party of
the same name, said Thursday the ruling banning the show was in a
provincial court in the Nile Valley town of Shibin el-Kom.
   In the case, brought by a lawyer identified as Mustafa Hamed
Khalifa, he was quoted as arguing that scenes in Falcon Crest are
``against morality and the constitution and incite debauchery,''
Wafd said.
   The newspaper said that in finding for the plaintiff, Chief Judge
Radwan Mohammed Radwan also ordered Information Minister Safwat
Sherif, in charge of state television and radio, to pay court costs.
   A spokesman for Sherif said Thursday that he knew nothing about
the case.
   The director of Egyptian television's Channel 2, which airs the
series, was not available for comment, but her secretary, Wafaa
Hammad, said she hadn't heard about the case either.
   ``We will be showing two more episodes next Sunday,'' she said.

   Move over, Ben Johnson. Make way, Lawrence Taylor.
Drugs have caught another sports star, this one named after a pub
and owned by the heir to the British throne.
   Devil's Elbow, a 4-year-old gelding, tested positive for three
stimulants after giving Prince Charles his first winner as a
race-horse owner in a $1,200 steeplechase at Worcester.
   In announcing the finding this week, the Jockey Club, which
governs horse racing in Britain, said there were no indications the
prince had anything to do with the doping and in all likelihood
would not be punished. Suspicions were that the drugs were contained
in contaminated feed.
   But trainer Nick Gaselee faces an $1,800 fine, and Devil's Elbow,
the namesake of a pub in Princeton, England, that also is owned by
the prince, could be stripped of the victory if further tests showed
the horse was deliberately doped.
   The Royal Family's longstanding love affair with horses and
racing was for the first time touched by the spreading stain of
drugs in sports, which have claimed such stars as Johnson, the
Olympic 100-meter runner from Canada, and Taylor, the all-pro
linebacker from the New York Giants.
   ``I am not aware of any other royal horse being disqualified for
this sort of reason,'' said Michael Oswald, manager of the Royal
Studs, the Royal Family's horse-breeding farm.
   Prince Charles, whose career as a steeplechase jockey ended
several years ago in a series of spills, was not commenting on the
drug findings.
   The tabloid Daily Star quoted an unidentified friend of the
prince as saying Charles was ``highly embarrassed'' by the case.
   ``The whole business is most upsetting for him _ it'll take some
living down,'' the friend was quoted as saying.
   Most of Britain's dozen national newspapers played the story on
the front page Thursday with the kind of headlines usually reserved
for sex scandals and ax murders.
   ``Charlie's Nag Fails Dope Test,'' the Daily Star said. ``Charles
Horse In Dope Shock,'' said the Daily Mail. The Times of London,
using Charles' formal position in the royal household, headlined its
front-page story: ``Prince of Wales' First Winner Fails a Dope
Test.''
   Like other sports, British horse racing has had trouble recently
with drugs. The Jockey Club said that of an estimated 6,500 samples
per year, 10-20 test positive, usually for legitimate medication
administered too close to race day.
   Two days after Devil's Elbow won the Novice Stakes at Worcester
Dec. 5, the Jockey Club leveled a record $31,500 fine against
trainer David Elsworth after one of his horses tested positive for
steroids.
   Steroids are muscle-builders and their use got Johnson thrown out
of the Olympics in Seoul. Drug use in horse racing in Britain, where
no medication is allowed in race entrants, more often involves
pain-killers or stimulants, such as the caffeine, theobromine and
theophylline found in Devil's Elbow.
   Gaselee said feed from his barn had been taken away for tests and
the Jockey Club confirmed that processed food, known as ``horse
nuts,'' was undergoing tests, which could take up to two weeks.
   Nevertheless, the club said, Gaselee remained in line for
punishment.
   ``I make it quite clear that if any substance is found in a
horse, which might have impaired or improved its running, the
trainer will be held responsible,'' Lord Fairhaven, the club's
senior steward, said.
   Added David Pipe, a Jockey Club spokesman: ``I do not know what
sort of diet this horse was on. But stimulants are not permitted.''
   On Wednesday, as the positive test of Devil's Elbow was being
announced, Britain's big race of the day was the Arkle Challenge
Trophy at Warwick.
   The winner? A horse named Positive.

   Mayor Sonny Bono greeted President
and Mrs. Reagan on their arrival to the desert community, but he
went empty-handed.
   Air Force One touched down Thursday afternoon at Palm Springs
Municipal Airport and taxied to a remote terminal, where the Reagans
got into a limousine for the short ride to the home of millionaire
publisher Walter Annenberg, where they traditionally spend the New
Year's holiday.
   Bono said he didn't have much to say to the president during
their brief minute on the tarmac. ``If I had a few hours with him,
I'm sure we could have solved a lot of problems,'' he added.
   Asked if he had a gift for Reagan, Bono replied, ``No, he's a
hard guy to buy for.''
   Bono said Reagan appeared on the ``Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour''
on television in the 1970s when Reagan was governor of California.
   ``He's pretty interesting, a neat guy,'' the mayor said.

publicist says.
   Gatlin wrote the song ``Brothers'' for Swayze's upcoming film
``Next of Kin,'' publicist Kathy Gangwisch said Thursday. Because
the film is still in production, it isn't clear yet if the ballad
will be used in the movie.
   Meantime, the two plan to give the number its premiere Jan. 13 at
a charity event in Houston for the Ileitis and Colitis Foundation,
Ms. Gangwisch said.
   Swayze and Gatlin intend to include their performance on the

   Gatlin is a member of The Gatlin Brothers, whose hits include
``All the Gold in California'' and ``Drunken Lady.'' Swayze, who
says he's a country music fan, gained fame with the movie ``Dirty

   Surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould,
pregnant with her fifth child, will travel to 22 cities this spring
to promote a book she co-wrote about the Baby M case, titled ``A
Mother's Story.''
   The book will focus on the negative effects of surrogate
motherhood on people, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Robert D.
Arenstein, said Thursday.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's unsuccessful legal fight to keep the child
she agreed to bear for William and Elizabeth Stern under a $10,000
contract sparked nationwide debate on surrogacy contracts.
   The girl was known in court papers as Baby M.
   The book was written with Pennsylvania investigative journalist
Loretta Schwartz-Nobel and published by St. Martin's Press.
   The 31-year-old Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lives in Bayport, N.Y., with
her second husband and three of her children, Arenstein said.
   ``She is pregnant and she is happy about it,'' the attorney added.
   Stern, eventually granted custody of the girl by the New Jersey
Supreme Court, had tried to stop Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from writing
the book, arguing it would exploit the child, named Melissa.
   But a Superior Court judge ruled that the book could focus on
Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's relationship with the child up until her
second birthday.

   Brown was transferred Thursday to the Park Correctional Center
just north of Columbia to serve his sentence for refusing to stop

   Brown, 55 and in good health, will likely work cleaning up the
wards, in the kitchen or helping inmates who may need help dressing
or getting around, said Department of Corrections spokesman Francis
Archibald.
   He'll be allowed visitors on Sundays, Archibald said.
   ``At least for the present, we plan to keep him there until we
release him,'' Archibald said. Brown will be eligible for parole in
1{ years, but could get out earlier through prison work or good
behavior.
   Brown was convicted and sentenced Dec. 15 in the chase through
Augusta, Ga., and North Augusta, S.C. He faces trial in Georgia on
10 misdemeanor counts Jan. 23.

   Actor Martin Sheen won a ruling from the
Nevada Supreme Court overturning a requirement that he post a $5,000
bond aimed at stopping a protest trespass at a nuclear test site.
   Sheen, active in the movement against nuclear testing, was forced
to post the ``peace bond'' after saying on national television he
would ``hopefully commit civil disobedience'' at the Nevada Test
Site.
   The Supreme Court, reversing a district judge's order, said
Thursday that prosecutors had conceded that civil disobedience
wasn't a crime in Nevada.
   ``We conclude that (Sheen's) remarks did not indicate an
intention to commit a criminal offense in this state,'' the court
added in holding that the ``peace bond'' statute doesn't apply in
such cases.
   Under Nevada law, the threat of a criminal act is enough to
require a ``peace bond.'' If a violation actually occurs, the bond
could be forfeited and the person could be jailed for up to six
months.

   The country's nuclear power plants reported
2,940 mishaps in 1987, a slight increase from the year before,
according to an anti-nuclear organization.
   A report Thursday by Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy
Project said the accident figure represented incidents reported by
nuclear plant owners to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
classified by the NRC as ``potentially significant safety events.''
   The corresponding figure was 2,836 accidents in 1986, when there
were 99 reactors in operation. The number of operating reactors grew
to 109 in 1987, according to the report.
   Public Citizen, a non-profit research organization and longtime
critic of nuclear power, also said Thursday that in 1987 there was a
record number of more than 104,000 incidents in which nuclear
workers were exposed to measurable doses of radiation.
   In addition, it said there were at least 430 emergency shutdowns
last year and at least 492 violations of nuclear plant safety rules.
   The report was based on NRC data compiled and analyzed by Public
Citizen.
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, said in releasing
the report: ``Public attention has recently been focused on the poor
safety conditions at the nation's nuclear weapons reactors.
   ``However, in 1987, badly managed commercial nuclear plants daily
threatened the safety of the public, particularly the 96 million
Americans who live within 50 miles of a reactor,'' she said.
   Public Citizen criticized the NRC for refusing to release key
safety data such as ``single-component failure'' records and a
comprehensive listing of all emergency plant shutdowns. It contended
that the commission's public records on safety violations are
incomplete and contradictory.
   Robert Newlin, an NRC spokesman, said he could not comment in
detail on specific allegations without first having a chance to
examine the Public Citizen report.
   ``I would say that in general the NRC makes data available to the
public on all safety issues,'' he said. Newlin added that based on a
variety of safety and operational criteria, ``the overall
performance at nuclear plants, we think, is improving.''
   Carl Goldstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, a nuclear industry group, said in response to the Public
Citizen report: ``America's nuclear plants have just ended a
record-breaking year, producing 20 percent of the nation's
electricity.
   ``The NRC and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations confirm
that, year by year, nuclear plants have improved their availability
and reduced the number of significant events, which are an important
measure of safe operation,'' Goldstein said.
   Here are key findings of the Public Citizen report:
   _In 1987 a total of 430 ``scrams'' or emergency plant shutdowns
were reported to the NRC. This worked out to an average of 4.4
shutdowns per operating reactor.
   Plants experiencing the largest number of scrams during the year
were Vogtle-1, Waynesboro, Ga., 27 shutdowns; Shearon Harris-1,
Newhill, N.C., 21 shutdowns, and Beaver Valley-2, Shippingport, Pa.,
17 shutdowns.
   _There were at least 2,940 mishaps at U.S. power reactors in
1987. That was the tally of ``licensee event reports'' submitted to
the NRC by utilities. According to NRC guidelines, they provide
descriptions of ``potentially significant safety events'' that
``might lead to serious accidents.''
   Reactors with the highest number of mishaps were Nine Mile
Point-2, Scriba, N.Y., 79 mishaps; Perry-1, North Perry, Ohio, 77
mishaps, and Vogtle-1, 75 mishaps.
   _In 1987 an all-time high of 104,458 incidents occurred in which
workers at nuclear reactors received measurable doses of radiation.
   _At least 492 violations of safety regulations at U.S. power
reactors were cited by the NRC in 1987. ``Inasmuch as NRC's data are
incomplete, the actual number is probably significantly higher,''
the Public Citizen report said.
   Plants at which the highest numbers of violations were reported
include Sequoyah-1 and 2, Daisy, Tenn., 37 violations; Browns
Ferry-1, 2 and 3, Decatur, Ala., 35 violations, and Turkey Point-3
and 4, Florida City, Fla., 33 violations.

   But the rural crossroads of Pintlala, which consists of little
more than a country store with gas pumps, took on the look of a
presidential retreat when George Bush arrived with his fishing
tackle.
   The president-elect, accompanied by a 17-vehicle entourage of
security and press, stopped by Thursday to fish for bass at Ray
Scott's 55-acre private lake in Pintlala's partly rolling, partly
swampy terrain 15 miles south of Montgomery.
   ``I haven't seen so much excitement since the milk truck turned
over a couple of years ago,'' said area resident Don Williamson.
   ``What Camp David and San Clemente have been to other presidents,
we hope Pintlala will be for the Bush administration,'' joked the
Rev. Gary Burton, pastor of the Pintlala Baptist Church, who
gathered with a dozen other people to welcome Bush.
   A few dozen more collected outside Scott's guarded gate Thursday
evening when the Bush caravan pulled out.
   ``Thank you all very much,'' said Bush, speaking through an
amplified car speaker. ``Happy New Year to everybody.''
   Scott, a Bush political ally and a Montgomery native who founded
the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, arranged the afternoon of
fishing in the former Creek Indian settlement.
   Bush caught nine fish by day's end. The largest weighed three
pounds, and he threw them all back.
   Scott and Bush played a joke on the press, with Bush holding up a
huge bass as cameras rolled. The fish was actually a mounted trophy
from Scott's home.
   The welcoming group, with one little girl holding high a sign
that read ``Good Fishing,'' cheered as Bush arrived. The group then
went to Mosley's service station, which serves as a grocery, hot dog
stand and unofficial city hall for Pintlala.
   At Mosley's, a few dozen other people had gathered, thinking Bush
would pass by the junction of U.S. 31 and Federal Road, which
amounts to ``downtown Pintlala.'' But the Bush motorcade took a
faster route on Interstate 65, turning into the Scott farm from
another local road.
   Pintlala's population is ``less than a thousand, not counting the
deer and quail,'' said Constable Ben Alpert.
   ``Use the word `quail' advisedly,'' warned the Rev. Burton.

   A Swiss man carrying 2,250 pieces
of gold concealed in his clothing has been arrested on smuggling
charges, Dutch customs officials say.
   Gold jewelry weighing 53 pounds and worth an estimated $320,000
was discovered in the suspect's clothing, a customs spokesman
speaking on condition on anonymity said Thursday.
   The suspect, a 28-year-old resident of Zurich, told officers he

   With 36.5 miles of shelves and more than 1.1
million different books, John Zubal thinks his bookstore offers the
largest collection of titles for sale in the world.
   He hopes the Guinness Book of World Records will think so, too.
   Zubal, 49, says he's writing the editors of the Guinness Book
once he has gathered supporting evidence. And there's quite a bit of
it.
   Four warehouses, packed with books from floor to ceiling, house
Zubal's volumes, arranged alphabetically by categories. The complex
is so large that, until recently, his 49-year-old wife, Marilyn,
used roller skates to retrieve customer requests.
   Guinness lists W. & G. Foyle Ltd. of London as the bookstore with
the most shelving at 30 miles, while Barnes & Noble Bookstore in New
York City is listed as the largest book building with 154,250 square
feet of books, said Sheelagh Thomas, a deputy editor for Guinness in
England.
   Zubal said he has 78,000 square feet of books, and more titles
than any other store because he has few duplicate books, textbooks
or remainders such as those sold at Barnes & Noble and Foyle.
   Bibliophiles from as far way as Japan visit his store regularly,
he said.
   But if you want to learn how to ski or groom your pet, don't go
to Zubal's.
   ``We don't have too many (books) for the casual reader,'' Zubal
said recently. ``Mostly our books are for the scholar and most are
sold by mail order. We are not too concerned with what is being
published now.''
   Fewer than 2 percent of Zubal's tomes were published after 1960,
he said.
   Some of the biggest categories are literary criticism,
anthropology, philosophy, theology and history. Zubal estimated he
has 250 books alone about Charles Dickens and 1,000 on Shakespeare.
   ``We do a lot of business in World War II books,'' said Zubal.
``We think there are about 6,000 books published on World War II,
and we have 3,000.''
   Zubal acquires most of his books from contacts who tell him of
literary estates or bookstores for sale.
   ``I used to hit the flea market circuit but now I let the younger
guys do it,'' said the bookseller, who travels to Europe several
times a year to buy and sell.
   Zubal also owns autographed editions by James Joyce, Ernest
Hemingway and flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker.
   While Zubal said all his books are for sale, ``there are books I
mark up to scare off the fainthearted.'' He was not ready to dicker
over an autographed edition of ``Finnegan's Wake'' priced at $3,000.
   ``I'm in no hurry to sell it,'' he said. ``It's money in the
bank.''
   Once Zubal submits his claim to Guinness, Ms. Thomas said, he
will need to submit two forms from witnesses validating his claim
and a color photograph.
   Ms. Thomas said editors would have to determine if his claim to
have the most individual titles would merit a separate record
category.
   ``That is always a possibility, but we can't make any promises,''
she said.

<HEAD>Government Foresees Another Good Year for U.S. Industry in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industry, helped by continued strong
demand for exports, will enjoy a seventh consecutive year of rising
sales in 1989, with high-technology businesses leading the gains,
according to government forecasts.
   The Commerce Department on Thursday released the 30th edition of
its U.S. Industrial Outlook, which each year picks the winners and
losers among American businesses based on detailed analyses of
market trends in 350 different manufacturing and service industries.
   ``Totaling up all the individual forecasts, you can see that we
are looking for another positive year for the economy,'' Deputy
Commerce Secretary Donna Tuttle said.
   ``Services will continue to be strong, and the majority of
manufacturing industries will continue to grow, especially those
producing capital equipment and exports,'' she said at a news
conference where she previewed the 566-page book.
   Tuttle said more than 70 percent of U.S. manufacturing industries
were expected to see higher sales in the new year, with the median
growth rate, after adjusting for inflation, projected to be 2.3
percent.
   Those projections represented a slight drop from the current
year, reflecting the belief that the non-farm economy, while not in
danger of a recession, will not do quite as well in 1989, Tuttle
said.
   Among the report's forecasts:
   _Some sectors of manufacturing will be held back by a continuing
slump in the construction industry, which will depress the demand
for steel and other building materials.
   _Industries providing services instead of goods, the fastest
growing portion of the economy, will continue to do well in 1989,
led by firms specializing in computers.
   _Aerospace, one of the largest manufacturing industries, will
show modest overall growth as rising demand for civilian aircraft is
offset by a drop in military orders.
   _Car sales will decline by about 1 percent to 10.6 million units,
with the share of sales held by manufacturers in Canada and the
United States holding steady at about 72 percent.
   _The banking industry, despite continued problems with
international debts and stiff competition from non-banking financial
companies, will show good growth, with assets rising by about 7
percent.
   _Airlines will have another strong year, with revenues rising by
more than 14 percent. Trucking revenues will rise 7 percent, while
revenues earned by railroads will increase 2 percent.
   _Health and medical services, one of the fastest growing service
industries, will show a sharp 10.7 percent rise in 1989 to an
estimated $618 billion.
   The report said the service category with the biggest projected
percentage increase will be space commercialization, where revenues
are expected to rise by 50 percent to $2.7 billion as the commercial
launch industry in the United States begins its first year of
operation.
   Other service standouts will be in the fields of data processing,
computer services and electronic data bases, with revenues projected
to rise by between 13 percent and 20 percent.
   In the manufacturing sector, the star performer is expected to be
the metal-cutting segment of the machine tool industry, with
shipments projected to rise by 13.9 percent. That reflects the boom
in capital investment as American industry rushes to expand
production facilities to meet rising export demands.
   The No. 2 manufacturing industry will be semiconductors, with a
projected 13.4 percent rise in shipments; followed by a 13 percent
increase in paper making machinery. Paper plants are now operating
at 95 percent of capacity and are trying to expand to meet the high
level of demand.
   Many of the manufacturing sectors expected to perform the most
sluggishly were tied to the construction industry. Sales of chemical
preparation were projected to drop by 14.6 percent, the largest
overall decrease. Sales of household cooking equipment were forecast
to decline by 7.9 percent, reflecting an expected decline in
construction of new homes next year.
   Demand for steel products are forecast to fall by 6.9 percent in
1989, reflecting a drop in demand for steel girders in construction.
   The Industrial Outlook can be purchased for $24 beginning next
month at the government's 21 regional bookstores.

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, will
return to television for the first time in nearly two years Monday
with a live show broadcast from their living room, a newspaper
reported today.
   Six independent television stations across the nation will carry
the program, said The Charlotte Observer, quoting unidentified
sources.
   Bakker, who was indicted with three associates this month on
charges of misusing millions of dollars in PTL money, could not be
reached for comment Thursday.
   Bakker has not had a regular TV show since resigning from PTL in
March 1987 after widely publicized allegations of his 1980 sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and payments to keep
her quiet. He and Tammy Bakker were co-hosts of PTL's ``Jim and
Tammy Show.''
   The Bakkers' new show will be broadcast live from their living
room near Pineville Monday through Friday and will be carried on
stations in Albany, N.Y.; Atlanta; Chico, Calif.; Los Angeles;
Philadelphia; and San Diego, the Observer said.
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms of Hendersonville said in a telephone
interview Thursday night that the Bakkers had been preparing to
return to television, but could not confirm when the return would
take place.
   While at PTL, the Bakkers' show was broadcast by about 180
television stations.
   Asked what kind of program the Bakkers are planning, a source
replied, ``The same as before.''
   ``It's real important,'' the source said of Monday's show. ``It's
the first day back. It's not going to be any fly-by-night thing.''

   A bomb exploded in a crowded neighborhood
in Punjab state today as police tried to defuse the device, killing
at least five people and injuring 20, authorities said.
   The dead included a police inspector and two constables working
to detach the bomb, which had been placed in a tin box and attached
to a bicycle parked in a central Amritsar neighborhood, authorities
said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred at
7:30 a.m.
   But police said they suspected Sikh militants waging a 6-year
guerrilla war against India's Hindu majority for a separate homeland
in Punjab, a prosperous farming state bordering Pakistan.
   According to a police spokesman, an anonymous caller warned
authorities of the bomb.
   Police Inspector Bhagat Singh and six assistants went to the
neighborhood and as they tried to defuse the bomb, it exploded,
killing Singh and constables Bachitar Singh and Kishan Lal, the
police spokesman said. Two men, a Sikh and a Hindu, also died.
   Twenty others, including several children on their way to school,
were injured, the spokesman said. At least 10 were in serious
condition, he said.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people, but they
are a slight majority in Punjab. Hindus comprise more than 80
percent of the country's population.
   Sikh militants, claiming discrimination by the Hindu community,
have been demanding an independent nation in Punjab since 1982. They
have been blamed for more than 2,400 killings this year alone.

<HEAD>Most Farmers Met Contracts Despite Drought, USDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The summer's devastating drought caused
relatively few farmers to renege on contracts for advance sales of
corn, soybeans and wheat, the Agriculture Department says.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service said a
survey of 325 elevators, or warehouses, in 13 Corn Belt and spring
wheat states showed farmers would default on less than 1 percent of
their contracts.
   ``Only about 1 percent of these elevators expected that losses
from farmers failing to meet contract commitments would exceed 10
percent of the elevator's net worth,'' the report said.
   The report was ordered by Congress in this year's Disaster
Assistance Act, which provided aid to farmers hit by the drought and
hot weather during the spring and early summer months.
   Drought raised commodity prices sharply and left many farmers
with less grain and soybeans to deliver than they had counted on
when they entered into forward contracts early in the year.
   ``Many would have liked to get out of their contracts, if that
were possible, because market prices rose above the contracted
prices,'' the report said. ``Some farmers produced less than they
had sold forward and faced buying out their contracts at a loss.''
   If farmers defaulted, that would leave elevators or other buyers
to absorb the losses.
   The report was sent to Capitol Hill but has not been distributed
generally by USDA. A copy was made available Thursday to The
Associated Press.
   Most of the information was based on a telephone survey of the
325 elevators in September. The report said the survey results also
were consistent with information obtained in field interviews of
elevator managers, telephone interviews of bankers and brokers, and
from state grain marketing specialists.
   ``Severe drought and the associated grain and soybean price
increases hit farmers who priced forward in two ways,'' the report
said. ``Those who hedged by selling futures were the first to be
affected. To meet margin calls during the period when prices
increased, these farmers had to either tap financial reserves or
obtain increased credit.''
   But the study found in a ``small-scale survey of commodity
brokers and bankers'' that farmers and their brokers and bankers
successfully weathered the sharp commodity price increases and the
resulting calls for greater margins, or deposits, that occurred in
June and July.
   ``For farmers who entered into cash forward contracts, the
financial problem hit when it became necessary to buy back contracts
in lieu of making delivery,'' the report said.
   More than half of the elevators surveyed had forward contracts
with farmers for corn, soybeans or wheat produced in 1988. The
contracts covered about 15 percent of the corn, 22 percent of the
soybeans and 7 percent of the spring wheat that these elevators
bought this year.
   According to the survey, the elevators indicated that more than
95 percent of their outstanding forward contracts with farmers
likely would be fulfilled as originally negotiated, with between 1
percent and 2 percent renegotiated, and less than 1 percent in
default. The remainder were uncertain.
   Officials had expected higher rates of default and renogotiation,
but the report said many farmers realized the possible intensity of
the drought by early June and curtailed normal contracting activity.
   ``As a result, farmers incurred fewer contract obligations than
they might have incurred if the drought had not become apparent
until later in the season,'' the report said.
   Weather also was important during that period, the report said.
Many areas, particularly in Ohio, Indiana and parts of Illinois,
received rain in late July and early August, which improved yield
prospects in those areas.
   In those cases, improved yields helped farmers meet contract
obligations, compared with the uncertainties of only a few weeks
earlier.
   The 13 states included an eastern Corn Belt region of Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, and a western Corn
Belt region of Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North
Dakota and South Dakota.

<HEAD>Experts Say Armenian Nuclear Plant Must be Reinforced or Shut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear plant in Soviet Armenia should be
strengthened against earthquakes as quickly as possible or closed,
experts were quoted as saying in an official report.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday that
specialists hurried to inspect the plant near Yerevan, the capital
of Armenia, after the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed thousands of
people.
   They concluded that the plant was not damaged but needed
reinforcement against earthquakes ``within the shortest possible
time'' or it should be closed, Tass said.
   The report follows an announcement by Soviet nuclear power
officials last week that six nuclear power projects were scrapped
because of earthquake danger or because of tougher standards. New
rules were imposed after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in April
1986 killed at least 31 people.
   Speculation abounded after the earthquake earlier this month that
the plant near Yerevan was damaged. The facility lies near a
geological fault.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told reporters in Yerevan on
Dec. 12 that the plant would be shut in two years.
   But the Tass story, quoting Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences, mentioned no deadline.
   The facility generates more than one-third of the Caucasus
mountain republic's electricity.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is pledging an
all-out effort to bring those responsible for the ``savage and
tragic'' bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 to justice.
   ``What we want to do is find out who did it and bring them to
justice,'' Reagan said in a statement Thursday before flying here
from Los Angeles to continue a two-week California vacation.
   When they arrived in Palm Springs, the president and Nancy Reagan
were greeted by the mayor of Palm Springs, entertainer Sonny Bono,
and his wife.
   The Reagans will be guests until Monday at the palatial desert
home of publisher Walter Annenberg in nearby Rancho Mirage,
continuing their custom of attending a New Year's party there.
   The Reagans then plan to return to Los Angeles to spend a few
more days in the Bel Air residence that will be their home after
Reagan's term ends on Jan. 20. They are scheduled to fly back to
Washington Jan. 5 for their final two weeks in the White House.
   Reagan's statement at the Los Angeles airport was his first since
British authorities announced more than 24 hours earlier that they
had determined the crash was caused by a bomb. The crash killed 259
people in the air _ mostly Americans _ and 11 on the ground.
   ``I think you all know that I have been following quite closely
the details of the Pan Am 103 tragedy, and now that we know
definitely that it was a bomb, we're going to make every effort we
can to find out who is guilty of this savage and tragic thing and
bring them to justice,'' the president said.
   Reagan, echoing comments made by officials in Washington, said
the Federal Aviation Administration ``is studying and making
recommendations as to additional things we can do at airports to
provide security for those who travel.''
   Asked whether he thought the bombing was the work of terrorists,
the president said, ``I can't comment on that. It seems to savor of
that, but we're going to have to have more details, and we're doing
everything we can to find them and working in connection with other
countries on that.''
   British investigators announced in London Wednesday they have
``conclusive evidence'' that a bomb, not structural failure, caused
the Pan American jumbo jet to break up Dec. 21 over southwestern
Scotland.

Religion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Christmas trees have reappeared in homes and social
clubs after a long absence, the latest sign of a softening in the
attitude of the officially atheist government toward the Roman
Catholic church.
   ``I considered it a tradition that couldn't be erased,'' said
Enrique Lopez Oliva, who teaches religion at the University of
Havana and also edits a newsletter on church issues.
   At a social club, a pine tree adorned with Christmas lights sits
a few feet from the statue of one of the martyrs of the Cuban
Revolution. But the great majority of the Christmas trees are found
in private homes and occupy an out-of-the-way place invisible to
passers-by.
   This Pennsylvania-sized nation of 10 million people, the least
religious of any in Latin America, branded Yuletide celebrations as
a ``bourgeois prejudice'' after the 1959 Communist takeover, Lopez
said.
   One reason: The government felt the manpower needed for the
winter sugar harvest should not be diverted by holiday celebrations.
That problem has become less acute with mechanization.
   Last year, several Cubans displayed a Christmas tree, and the old
tradition picked up considerable momentum this year.
   Putting up a Christmas tree can be a chore since none is sold
commercially and often they must be dug up from wooded areas, no
small task in a country with few private cars.
   In addition, ornaments generally are available only if they were
stashed away _ and not discarded _ when the government began
discouraging Christmas observances.
   Several Cubans said Christmas always had been considered more of
an occasion for family gatherings and gift-giving than a religious
festival.
   Still, even the limited Yuletide observation is a far cry from a
few years ago, when the only acknowledgement of the holiday were the
signs in stores reserved for foreigners: ``December is gift-buying
month.''
   This was a subtle attempt by the government to earn dollars by
getting foreign visitors to buy Christmas presents in Cuba. Lopez
said Cuban authorities have become much more accommodating attitude
toward the church as part of an effort to improve the country's
image abroad.
   As an example, he said the government has allowed 30 new priests
to immigrate to Cuba this year, the largest number since the
revolution.
   President Fidel Castro also said there will be no limit on the
number of foreign nuns allowed to immigrate. In addition, there have
been hints the government is negotiating with Pope John Paul II for
his first visit to the island.
   But the more flexible government attitude toward the church has
not always been met by reciprocal gestures from church leaders.
   Six weeks ago, Carlos Manuel De Cespedes, the general vicar of
the Havana Diocese, expressed concern about the ``falsity, deceit,
apathy, and dishonesty'' that permeate social life in Cuba.
   There is no disputing, however, the more relaxed government
stance toward the church.
   In the early 1960s, for example, the government looked on the
church as a hotbed of anti-revolutionary sentiment and expelled 600
of Cuba's 800 priests.
   Students were taught atheism and only in 1979 was religion made a
part of the university teachings. Now, Lopez said, ``the campaign to
instill with atheism has diminished. There is more flexibility.''

   President-elect Bush, back home in Washington
after a hunting and fishing vacation, said he was ``fairly close''
to making his two remaining Cabinet-level appointments and ready to
focus on his first 100 days in the Oval Office.
   Bush ended a four-day vacation Thursday with a successful bass
fishing outing on a private lake in Pintlala, Ala. He caught nine
fish, the largest a three-pounder.
   Today Bush was having a private meeting with Thomas Pickering,
the U.S. ambassador to Israel who Bush has nominated as the new
ambassador to the United Nations. Bush also planned to meet with
William Webster, director of the CIA, a job Bush once held.
   Bush said he was ``fairly close'' to naming his energy secretary
and his drug czar, the only two Cabinet-level posts still vacant in
his new administration.
   According to sources, James Schlesinger, who was energy secretary
in the Carter administration and defense secretary in the Nixon and
Ford administrations, was among a number of candidates Bush was
considering for the energy post.
   On Thursday in Beeville, Texas, before heading to Alabama, Bush
told reporters his top priorities were to ``finish the Cabinet,
start fleshing out the secretary and undersecretary levels,'' and
then start making ``definitive plans for the first 100 days'' of his
new administration, which begins after his Jan. 20 inauguration.
   Before he left Beeville, where he hunted quail on a friend's
ranch for three days, Bush threatened retaliation, if possible,
against those who planted a bomb on a Pan American jetliner that
crashed Dec. 21 in Scotland, killing all 259 people on board.
   Bush said he would ``seek hard and punish firmly, decisively,
those who did this, if you can ever find them.''
   But the vice president refused to specify how he would retaliate,
and he said it was unlikely terrorism could ever be stopped
completely.
   ``It is almost impossible to guarantee there will never be
another terrorism act,'' he said, though he suggested that improved
intelligence and cooperation between nations would help.
   In Alabama, Bush and his friend, Ray Scott, founder of
Bassmasters, each caught nine bass in four hours of fishing, said
Bush spokesman Steve Hart.
   Bush, said Hart, has decided to take another short vacation
before the inauguration: two days fishing in Islamorada in the
Florida Keys about 75 miles south of Miami.
   Hart, who did not have an exact schedule for Bush, said the
fishing trip could take place over the Martin Luther King holiday
Jan. 16.
   This weekend Bush and his wife, Barbara, are going to the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., in the Cacotin Mountains,
leaving on Friday and probably returning on Monday, Hart said.

<HEAD>Navy Denies Eagleton Accusation Of Stonewalling On Base Closings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Base Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy, denying an accusation by a member of
a commission that compiled recommendations for military base
closings, said it cooperated with the panel's review.
   In the recommendations issued Thursday, the Navy lost six
installations, three of which had not yet entered service, compared
with five major bases lost by the Air Force and the Army's 26 bases
and 52 housing units that would be partially or wholly closed.
   Thomas Eagleton, a former Democratic senator from Missouri who
joined the 12-member commission part way through its seven-month
review, said ``the Navy stonewalled, and got away with it.''
   ``The Air Force ultimately gave its cooperation. The Army
begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation,'' Eagleton said in an
``additional view'' at the close of the 88-page final report
released by the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure.
   For the Navy, he said, ``intransigence paid off. When the new
secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of
trimming the Pentagon budget, he should most certainly start with
the Navy. The Navy `refused to play' this time; it should be obliged
to next time.''
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley rejected Eagleton's
criticism.
   ``We feel we did cooperate with the commission and clearly
answered whatever questions the commission had,'' Quigley said
Thursday.
   Eagleton's comment may be more a measure of the mood of the three
services than their willingness to eliminate facilities, Pentagon
officials said.
   One Army officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Eagleton's statement recalled the phrase ``the dumb, the devious and
the defiant _ the Army being the dumb, the Air Force devious and the
Navy defiant.''
   Navy officers argued that unlike the Air Force and the Army, they
eliminated many facilities employing thousands of people during the
1970s. Those facilities included the Quonset Point Naval Air Station
and Newport Naval Base in Rhode Island, the Boston Naval Shipyard,
the Glynco Naval Air Station in Georgia, the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard
in New York, and the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard near San Francisco.
   Three of the six Navy facilities nominated by the commission for
elimination were part of the home port program, and construction on
them either had not started or was not complete. They included the
Naval Station at Hunters Point, the Naval Station at Galveston,
Texas, and the Naval Station at Lake Charles, La.
   Another Navy base to be eliminated, the Puget Sound Naval Station
in Washington state, is an administrative center 35 miles by
automobile from another homeport, at Everett, Wash.
   The commission recommended moving administrative facilities from
the Brooklyn Naval Station to nearby Staten Island, where a homeport
is under construction. The sixth Navy facility recommended for
closure is the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia, which the commission
called ``unsafe and inadequate to support modern health care ... The
hospital cannot be modernized.''
   None of the affected Army or Air Force bases was critical, and
most employees would be transferred, those services said.
   The Army stands to lose the most bases, including a major
training center, Fort Dix, N.J., to be placed inactive status,
affecting 3,140 military and 1,516 civilian employees.
   Also picked for closing were Fort Sheridan in Illinois, with
1,319 military and 1,681 civilian employees; and the Presidio
offices would close in San Francisco, with 2,140 military and 3,150
civilian employees.
   An Army spokesman, Maj. Dick Bridges, said he saw ``no
unwarranted closures on the list.''
   ``On first look, it seems that they have done their homework,''
he said. ``Sheridan, the Presidio and Dix have appeared on lists
from time immemorial ... If we don't need them, we should get rid of
them.''
   An Air Force spokesman, Maj. Lou Figueroa, said that service
``fully supports the commission and its charter to bring about more
efficient use of defense resources.''
   The Air Force maintains a military force of 607,000, said
Figueroa. Of those, 15,743 would be relocated. The Air Force has a
civilian work force of 264,348, of whom 5,086 would be affected.
   The commission recommended that the Air Force close five of its
94 major bases: Chanute in Illinois; George, Mather and Norton in
California and Pease in New Hampshire. Most of their functions would
be taken over by Canon Air Force Base in New Mexico, Sheppard AFB in
Texas, March AFB in California, and Mountain Home AFB in Idaho.
   Of the Air Force bases affected, only Mather has strategic
bombers, and the report said its B-52s are ``programmed to retire.''
Norton is one of six Military Airlift Command bases. Chanute is
largely a training base. The F-4 tactical fighter wing at George is
to be retired.
   FB-111 bombers located at Pease are being moved. The base is
considered vulnerable to surprise attack from submarine-launched
cruise missiles.

<HEAD>Report: Steinberg Target Of Securities Fraud Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has widened its probe of alleged
securities fraud at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to include
corporate raider Saul Steinberg, according to report published today.
   The investigation of Steinberg, one of Drexel's junk bond
clients, focuses on an alleged ``stock parking'' scheme involving
Drexel's junk bond chief Michael Milken, The Washington Post
reported.
   In ``stock parking'' an investor hides his ownership of stock by
placing the shares with someone else and agreeing to buy them back
at some other time.
   The newspaper, citing sources it did not identify, said
government investigators are examining whether Steinberg four years
ago hid stock he owned in Wickes Cos. through an insurance firm he
controlled.
   Wickes, an automotive, industrial and home furnishings company,
was then operating under federal bankruptcy law and New York laws
prohibit insurance companies from owning stock in firms under
bankruptcy proceedings.
   The newspaper also said another Drexel junk bond employee, Carl
Deremer, who was responsible for Steinberg's accounts, has been told
by federal prosecutors he likely will be indicted on criminal fraud
charges. The Beverly Hills, Calif.,-based Milken and other Drexel
employees also reportedly face possible indictment.
   Steinberg gained prominence as one of a new breed of corporate
raiders on Wall Street in his attempts to take over such companies
as Walt Disney Co., Quaker States Corp. and Penn Central Corp.
Steinberg bought shares in those companies through another firm,
Reliance Group Holdings Inc.
   Drexel last week agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and
pay $650 million in penalties to end a U.S. attorney's securities
fraud investigation of the company. The company still faces
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   A proposal that 34 major U.S. military bases be closed brought
warnings of economic woe from disheartened local officials and
merchants, but there were sighs of relief around installations
spared the ax or slated for expansion.
   ``I think it will be devastating _ 50 percent of our employment
at least has to do with Chanute,'' Mayor Katy Podagrosi said in
rural Rantoul, Ill., home of Chanute Air Force Base.
   The training center, with 2,133 military and 1,035 civilian jobs,
was one of the military bases recommended for closure in the report
issued Thursday.
   But church bells pealed in Enid, Okla., when officials learned
Vance Air Force Base was unaffected by the plan, and officers
cheered at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base when they learned it would
stay open.
   ``Without question, we are very pleased,'' Enid Mayor Bruce
Harvey said.
   In all, the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure
recommended closing 86 facilities, including 52 military housing
units, partially closing five others, and revising the roles and
staffing levels at 54 others.
   If the plan is carried out, the commission estimated, the
government would save $693 million annually and $5.6 billion over
the next two decades. While 58,500 military and civilian employees
would lose their jobs or be transferred, other bases would get
37,850 new jobs or assignments.
   San Francisco stands to lose the city's third largest employer if
the Presidio Army base is closed as recommended. The base, one of
the loveliest spots in the city, employs about 3,000 civilians and
2,700 military.
   ``For 112 years, the Presidio has been an integral part of San
Francisco. It was here before San Francisco was a city. It's been a
very good neighbor ... an important part of our economy,'' said
Mayor Art Agnos.
   Under the 1972 federal law that established the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area, all but 36 of the Presidio's 1,490 acres
would become part of the popular park, which includes coastal land
both in San Francisco and Marin County north of the Golden Gate.
   ``(Closure) would be bad. We get a lot of business from the base.
We would really feel it,'' said Linda Jacobsen, manager of a
Travelodge motel only a few yards from the Presidio's main gate.
   ``Nobody likes to see business go down the drain, and that's
what's happening,'' said Mike Rudolph, owner of Il Forno Pizzeria,
across the street from the main gate of Fort Sheridan in suburban
Chicago.
   The base has about 2,000 civilian employees and 2,000 military
employees, including about 1,000 full-time soldiers who direct
140,000 reservists from seven states.
   ``Nobody likes to lose their job,'' said Fidel Ghini, mayor of
neighboring Highwood for the last two decades. ``But look ... the
federal government has a job to do. It's time we put a stop to all
this waste.''
   The mood was somber in shops around Fort Dix, N.J. The commission
recommended that the Army's second-largest basic training site be
reduced to ``semiactive status'' and that its complement of 8,300
permanent military and civilian jobs be cut by more than 4,600.
   `I am very worried,'' said Bill Ziotas, as he leaned across the
counter of the Palace Restaurant, which he has owned for 24 years.
``I'd have to close down, because 65 percent of my business comes
from Fort Dix. I hope our politicians will be able to do something.''
   But what was bad news for some communities was welcome news in
others that will gain jobs as a result of the closures.
   In Ingleside, Texas, a naval base being built would receive
fleets previously assigned to ports in Galveston and Lake Charles,
La., which were recommended for abandonment.
   ``I'm glad to be off the hook,'' said Mark Crawford, mayor of the
community 20 miles north of Corpus Christi. ``Ingleside will move
forward in the right direction.''

<HEAD>Satirical Sex-and-Politics Shows Pack Athens Theaters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics and sex, the mix that has rocked
Greek theater for 2,400 years, is finding new life in satirical
shows that mock Premier Andreas Papandreou and his relationship with
a former flight attendant.
   Greeks are packing the capital's theaters to laugh at satires of
the 69-year-old socialist premier, who is carrying on a public
relationship with 34-year-old Dimitra Liani while his governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement is besieged by financial scandals.
   Public affairs _ sexual and political _ have been favorite topics
for Greek comedians since the playwright Aristophanes made the
combination a smash hit in the 5th century B.C.
   This year the writers didn't need much imagination.
   Papandreou's heart operation in London last September inspired
the title of a popular revue, ``Post-Aorta Greece,'' written and
directed by Lakis Lazopoulos, Greece's top satirist.
   Lazopoulos asks innocently at each show: ``If a newcomer to
Athens saw Andreas and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would
he think?
   ``That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street,''
comes the answer.
   Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of Papandreou and Ms.
Liani embracing advertises ``Little Dimitra's Sweetheart'', a
take-off of a classic Greek folklore play, ``The Little
Shepherdess's Sweetheart.''
   In the show, an Athens housewife is asked whether the premier's
pre-election pledges of political and social change have been
fulfilled.
   ``Andreas has made one change OK. He changed his American woman
for a Greek,'' she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic
applause.
   Three months ago, Papandreou said he will divorce his 66-year-old
American-born wife Margaret, but no proceedings have yet been
started. The blonde Ms. Liani has been divorced twice.
   Six political revues are playing over the holiday season.
   According to box-office figures, the shows are grossing up to
$37,500 a week, twice as much as the most successful drama in Athens.
   The socialists banned censorship when they came to power in 1981,
and the satirists say they're not afraid of libel prosecution _ even
for the bawdiest jokes about Papandreou and Ms. Liani.
   ``I feel really free. If I couldn't say the things I say I would
suffocate,'' said Lazopoulos, 31, who was acquitted in 1987 on
charges of slandering Greece's head of state, President Christos
Sartzetakis, in one show.
   ``Greeks have no other way to let steam off. If they couldn't
laugh at their problems, they would explode,'' Lazopoulos added.
   According to critic Eleni Varopoulou, the current shows' mix of
satirical sketches, monologues, songs and dance is styled after
French revue and German cabaret.
   ``But the acidity of the satire is what characterizes the Greek
revue,'' she said.
   Other favorite targets range from family relations to the
inadequate public Varopoulou said the harsh Greek satire isn't aimed
at making people think, but at soothing and relieving them ``so that
by understanding their problem they exorcise it.''
   The revues used to be staged like ancient comedy or modern
musicals, with a glamorous chorus line and expensive costumes, but
the trend is toward less glitz and more realism, Varopoulou said.
   Lazopoulos says he prefers simple staging, but notes the
Aristophanic tradition is still going strong.
   ``I find we have the same attitude against authority as
Aristophanes. We can never match his writing but we can try to match
him in not being afraid to criticize,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips Against Yen In Last Trading Day Of Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar slipped today against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo, ending the year's final trading day at 125.90 yen.
   After opening at 125.75 yen, down 0.28 yen from Thursday's
closing, the dollar inched up but failed to regain its Thursday
level. It closed at 125.90 yen, down 0.13 yen, after ranging between
125.75 and 126.00 yen during the day.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's losses in Tokyo to its decline on
overseas markets Thursday.
   A dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo described trading as
``very thin'' ahead of the three-day New Year's holiday starting
Saturday.
   After beginning the year in Tokyo on Jan. 4 at 120.45 yen, its
lowest level since modern exchange rates were established in the
late 1940s, the dollar stayed mostly between 120 and 130 yen in the
first half of the year.
   However, in the second half it fluctuated between the low-120 yen
and mid-130 yen levels. After peaking at 136.75 yen on Sept. 2, the
U.S. currency began declining to a low closing of 120.88 yen on Nov.
25. Since then it has remained generally within the 120-126 yen
range.
   Currency dealers said more stability is expected in exchange
rates in 1989 unless President-elect Bush makes drastic changes in
his economic policy from that of the Reagan administration.
   ``But unless the United States succeeds in trimming its twin
deficits, the general tendency will be toward a weaker dollar
against a stronger yen,'' said a dealer at a U.S. commercial bank in
Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange will reopen Jan. 4.

   Former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos was
hospitalized in guarded condition with possible congestive heart
failure or pneumonia, hospital officials said.
   Marcos, who contends he is too ill to travel to New York for
arraignment on racketeering charges, entered St. Francis Medical
Center on Thursday for the second time in three weeks.
   ``They (the attending physicians) have diagnosed him as a
possible congestive heart failure or pneumonia,'' said St. Francis
nursing supervisor Cindy Miller. Marcos, 71, was listed in guarded
condition.
   A leading Marcos supporter, said a priest administered the last
rites to Marcos, but a Marcos spokesman could not provide
confirmation.
   Marcos is ``very, very seriously ill,'' said the supporter,
Friends of Marcos President Joe Lazo. ``We are preparing a telegram
to send to President Reagan and President-elect Bush, asking them to
let him (Marcos) go home. That is his dying wish.''
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said he did not know if a priest
had administered the sacrament of the sick, formerly known as
extreme unction.
   Marcos was brought to the hospital by ambulance at 4:55 p.m.,
said St. Francis spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   Trinidad said he was with Marcos when he was taken to the
hospital, but said he did not know why the decision was made to
return Marcos to St. Francis.
   ``You'd better ask the doctors,'' Trinidad said in a telephone
interview earlier Thursday. ``All I know is he is in serious
condition.'' He would not elaborate.
   However, Marcos' private physician Dr. Azucena Ignacio, asked if
his patient's condition was serious, replied, ``We don't know yet.''
   Ms. Ignacio said Marcos' wife, Imelda, was at the hospital with
her husband.
   Marcos returned to his Makiki Heights residence Dec. 18 following
a 9-day stay at St. Francis, where he was treated for congestive
heart failure, his doctors said.
   Ignacio and Marcos cardiologist Calvin Wong said upon his release
that Marcos suffered from congestive heart failure, which means the
heart is unable to pump the amount of blood required by the body.
   A federal grand jury in New York City indicted Marcos and his
wife, Imelda, on Oct. 21, on racketeering charges. They were accused
of looting more than $100 million from their homeland to buy art and
real estate in Manhattan.
   Mrs. Marcos later went to New York to plead innocent to the
charges and is free on $5 million bail.
   Marcos claimed he was too ill to travel to New York. His
arraignment has been postponed indefinitely.
   The Marcoses fled to Hawaii in February 1986 following his ouster
in a civilian-military revolt.

   Some of the 34 major military bases that would be closed under a
federal commission's plan have served the military for decades and
played a vital role in the country's defense over the years.
   They include:
   _ PRESIDIO ARMY BASE _ Founded by the Spanish in 1776 on a hill
now overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, the
Presidio has been a U.S. Army base since 1846. The Presidio is now
the headquarters of the 6th U.S. Army, which controls Army
activities in 12 Western states.
   _ FORT SHERIDAN _ Located in suburban Chicago, Fort Sheridan is a
graceful cluster of tan brick buildings that resembles a college
campus. It opened in 1887, on 600 acres of land donated to the U.S.
government by members of the Commercial Club of Chicago, who wanted
federal troops nearby _ reportedly after a riot a year earlier. It
is the home of the Army's Recruiting Command and the Fourth U.S.
Army.
   _ FORT DOUGLAS _ The 119-acre Army installation was built east of
Salt Lake City in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes from Indians and
keep an eye on Mormon settlers. It is a collection of parade
grounds, barracks and other brick and whitewashed buildings, some
dating from the 1920s and 1930s.
   _ BROOKLYN NAVY YARD _ The first U.S. fighting ship was built in
1798 in what is now the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The government bought
the yard in 1801 where it built vessels until the 1960s, employing
as many as 70,000 people during World War II. Work on the Civil War
ironclad Monitor was done there, and the battleships Maine, Arizona
and Missouri were built there. The city eventually took over most of
the yard.
   _ ARMY MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY _ The lab in Watertown,
Mass., is the successor to the Watertown Arsenal, commissioned by
President James Madison during the War of 1812. During its heyday,
the arsenal was a major weapons maker, turning out cannons during
the Civil War. The arsenal was closed in 1967, leaving the much
smaller materials lab.
   _ PEASE AIR FORCE BASE _ Pease opened in 1956 in New Hampshire
and has been home of the 509th Bombardment Wing, whose predecessor,
the 509th Composite Group of the Army Air Corps, dropped the bomb on
Hiroshima. President-elect George Bush uses the base when he travels
to his home in Maine.

<HEAD>Mayor Barry Says He May Take Drug Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry admitted visiting an
acquaintance suspected of drug involvement ``caused some
embarrassment'' for the city but said he was innocent of wrongdoing
and would be ``extra, extra careful'' to avoid appearances of
impropriety in his personal life.
   The city's U.S. attorney, meanwhile, said Thursday that his
office had decided to conduct a full investigation of the incident,
in which the mayor visited a former city employee at a Washington
hotel just as police were preparing to attempt an undercover drug
buy from the man.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted an unidentified
source as saying the FBI may join the federal investigation.
   Police have turned over to U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens results
of an internal probe into why two detectives were stopped from
attempting a drug buy from former city employee Charles Lewis after
Barry turned up at Lewis' hotel room. The incidence occurred a week
ago.
   Earlier this week, federal prosecutors had said only that they
were reviewing what police investigators had found. But on Thursday,
Stephens said his office ``is conducting a full investigation of
this entire matter.''
   Barry, through spokesmen, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
On Thursday he called a news conference to answer questions ``around
the controversy'' and he vigorously denied using or seeing drugs in
the hotel room.
   ``I believe that one is innocent until proven guilty,'' Barry
said. ``But since last Thursday, I have been tried, convicted,
sentenced and doing time, by some members of the media.''
   Barry has acknowledged making several visits to Lewis, whom he
described as an acquaintance, but denied any involvement with drugs.
   Asked in a separate interview on WJLA-TV whether he would submit
to a drug test, Barry responded, ``I would do anything necessary to
get this issue behind us.'' He said he would discuss it with his
doctor ``and he'll tell me what to do.''
   Asked if that meant he would take the drug test if his doctor
approved, the mayor said he would, ``absolutely.''
   However, Barry's spokesman, John White, said earlier that no
purpose would be served by such a test since ``he doesn't do drugs.''
   The police investigation, according to sources, was focused on
whether Lewis was involved in any drug activity, why the mayor was
in the hotel, and why the police officers did not search Lewis'
hotel room until after he had checked out Friday morning. Hotel
employees, police sources said, initially had complained that Lewis
had offered drugs in return for sex.
   ``The public needs to know what happened,'' Barry said. ``I still
have demanded and call for a complete investigation and a complete
disclosure of this report so this city can get on with its
business.''
   At the beginning of the news conference, Barry promised to
provide details on his relationship with Lewis, but he revealed only
that he met Lewis when Lewis worked for the district government. The
mayor refused to answer reporters' questions after finishing his
remarks.
   While city employees applauded Barry as he marched from the
council chambers, others were not impressed with the mayor's
comments.
   ``He had an opportunity to talk to the nation, and he missed that
opportunity,'' said City Council Chairman David Clarke. ``There were
a lot of unanswered questions.''
   Barry's latest controversy refocuses scrutiny on his personal
life.
   Barry, who is married, acknowledged last year he once had a
``personal'' relationship with a convicted cocaine dealer, Karen
Johnson. However, he denied buying cocaine from her or using drugs
with her, and denied reports she had been paid hush money.
   Johnson had been jailed on contempt charges three years earlier
after refusing to testify before a grand jury. Officials say the
case remains under investigation.

<HEAD>Former Health Official And Early Critic Of Rocky Flats Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEAT RIDGE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Carl J. Johnson, an early and
outspoken critic of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, has died
of complications from heart surgery. He was 59.
   Johnson died Thursday at the Lutheran Medical Center in this
Denver suburb, his son, Frederick, said.
   Johnson was forced to resign as Jefferson County health director
in May 1981, following his publication of studies showing a higher
incidence of cancer in areas of Jefferson and Denver counties close
to the Rocky Flats plant 16 miles northwest of Denver.
   Johnson sued numerous county officials over the firing. He
received a $150,000 settlement in January 1985.
   ``They fired the messenger for the message,'' said John Holland,
the attorney who represented Johnson in the case. ``They killed off
the community's public health director for proving that the
community had a major illness.
   ``To me, Carl Johnson was truly a great man ... His death is a
tragedy in that it's too early.''
   Holland said Johnson ``accomplished a great portion of his
mission which was to revitalize the people's right to live in a safe
setting.''
   Johnson's supporters said the government is now starting to
acknowledge points he had been making for years.
   For example, the Department of Energy recently compiled a
modernization report which calls for improvements to the nation's
nuclear weapons facilities through the year 2010.
   According to a summary of the $250 billion Energy Department
plan, Rocky Flats' recycling buildings would be upgraded between
1990 and 1997 to continue operating safely as the plant is gradually
shut down and relocated.
   Johnson recently had been doing consulting work on the effects of
nuclear radiation, Holland said. He wrote and published articles,
including a Dec. 18 column in The New York Times, headlined ``Rocky
Flats: Death Inc.''
   ``If the nation is to be properly protected, all studies of
nuclear contamination and associated health effects should be
conducted primarily by independent scientists who are insulated from
cynical retaliation,'' he wrote.
   The Sims, Ind., native received his medical degree in 1965 from
Ohio State University College of Medicine. He also held a master's
degree in public health from the University of California School of
Public Health at Berkeley.
   He became Jefferson County health director in 1973.
   Following his resignation, he spent five years as a medical
officer with the South Dakota Health Department in Pierre, S.D. He
recently returned to Denver.
   As controversy surrounding Rocky Flats built over the past four
months, Johnson appeared and spoke at almost every public forum.
   He also served as a colonel in the medical corps of the U.S. Army
Reserve from 1970 until his death.
   Johnson is survived by his wife, Kathryn, and three sons.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wants to launch a
peace initiative within two months and will seek Egypt's help in
finding non-PLO Palestinian negotiators, an aide said today.
   Also today, the mayor of the West Bank town of Bethlehem said he
proposed the U.N. Security Council pass a resolution calling for a
truce to end the yearlong Palestinian uprising.
   ``I spoke about a U.N.-sponsored resolution like the one that
stopped the Iran-Iraq war, and on condition that Israel ... releases
all prisoners jailed on security charges and reopens universities,''
Mayor Elias Freij said in an interview.
   About 5,000 Palestinians are in jail, including about 1,600 held
without trial under administrative detention. Five Palestinian
universities and 16 two-year colleges are closed.
   Freij made the proposal in a meeting with Romanian President
Nicolae Ceaucescu two weeks ago. Freij said he asked that the
proposal be passed to PLO chief Yasser Arafat. He said Arafat has
not yet responded.
   Freij's statement came as Palestinians debated the possibility of
a conditional truce as a prelude to elections in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where 1.7 million Palestinians live under Israeli
military occupation.
   The debate is taking place in advance of Shamir's expected
unveiling of a plan for starting Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Shamir, said the premier hoped to start
his peace initiative within two months _ about the time Shamir is
expected to visit Washington for talks with the Bush administration.
   In an interview, Pazner said Shamir was agreeable to talks being
launched by the United States and Soviet Union. Shamir also
envisioned a ``major role'' for Egypt in helping find Palestinians
that would be acceptable to Israel, which has refused to negotiate
with the PLO.
   Pazner denied reports that Egypt would broker the process or that
the superpowers would formally guide the negotiations. He said
Shamir insisted on direct talks between Israel and the Arabs.
   ``If the two superpowers call on neighbors to negotiate that's
all right but the talks would be direct talks,'' Pazner said.
   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported Thursday the Israeli plan
proposes an unofficial understanding that Palestinian negotiators be
chosen or appointed by the PLO but not belong to PLO institutions or
have a terrorist past.
   Officials have declined comment on the report. But Shamir aide
Yossi Ahimeir said choosing Palestinians was the ``internal
business'' of the Arab side.
   ``We only insist that there should be no PLO people or people
identified with the PLO,'' he said.
   Shimon Shamir, Israel's ambassador to Egypt, was summoned to
Jerusalem and met Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today amid reports
Israel was planning to present new proposals to Egypt soon.
   Both Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, and his political
rival Shimon Peres of the Labor Party have hinted that their
coalition government will propose holding Palestinian elections as
part of a peace package.
   As a condition for any such concessions, Shamir and Peres insist
that Palestinians end the violence in the occupied lands. Since the
Palestinian uprising broke out in December 1987, 339 Arabs and 14
Israelis have been killed.
   In the past, clandestine leaders of the uprising and prominent
Palestinians above ground have called for elections, but the latest
underground leaflets and a statement from the PLO's executive
committee both opposed the Israeli proposals.
   Saeb Erakat, a political science professor at An Najah University
in the West Bank city of Nablus, said the election idea was another
Israeli attempt to find an alternative to recognizing the PLO.
   ``Why stall and lose time and try to escape the realities of
peacemaking,'' he said. ``I think we should tell Israel that instead
of introducing such ideas you should face the PLO.''
   Jack Khazmo, Palestinian publisher of the weekly Al Bayader Al
Siyassi magazine in Jerusalem, noted that of the Palestinian
officials elected in West Bank municipal elections in 1972 and 1976,
Israel deposed nine mayors and deported three others.
   ``Even if we say yes to the elections who will guarantee that the
Israelis will not interfere in such elections?'' he said.
   Despite such doubts, some Palestinians have given conditional
support to the idea.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily newspaper Al Fajr in
Jerusalem, proposed balloting be held in three stages: a referendum
on the PLO's declaration of independence, municipal elections and
selection of representatives who could serve as a link to the PLO.
   ``These Palestinians can serve as a bridge (with the PLO) if they
are allowed to go back and forth (to Jordan) and carry messages,''
he said.
   The Israeli concept of elections has not been clearly defined.
Peres aides have suggested elections would choose a new leadership
to talk with Israel about a settlement. But Shamir aides suggest
elections would choose only an administrative council as part of a
Palestinian autonomy scheme.
   The liberal daily Haaretz newspaper said Palestinian willingness
for a truce had been conveyed to U.S. diplomats by leading figures
in the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Transcript of Pentagon Briefing on Base Closings Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a condensed transcript of the Pentagon
briefing Thursday on recommendations by the defense secretary's
commission on military base closings. Participants were Deputy
Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV and commission co-chairmen
Abraham Ribicoff and Jack Edwards.
   RIBICOFF: We believe the results reflect a balanced report to
eliminate unnecessary installation capacity without restricting the
flexibility of our national security managers during future
mobilizations, contingencies and changes in the international
political environment. The recommended changes reflect an
opportunity to improve the nation's defense position.
   EDWARDS: We would like to take this opportunity ... to thank the
department and the Congress for this opportunity to participate in a
unique effort, which will not only save taxpayers dollars, but also
improve our national defense posture.
   During the course of developing our recommendations, we used
improvement in military value of our domestic base structure as the
preeminent consideration. Our report presents an opportunity to
reduce training costs in terms of manpower, overhead costs and fuel,
to improve command and control, to consolidate training and improve
economies of scale, and to remove unnecessary administrative burdens
to our defense managers.
   Add to these improvements an opportunity to eliminate some future
military construction costs and to save almost $700 million a year
in base operating costs with a 20-year net present value of $5.6
billion.
   Despite these improvements, we do not anticipate any substantial
socio-economic disruption to the communities that are closely linked
with bases recommended for closure.
   In terms of environmental impact, we see little negative impact
from these recommendations, and in many instances, improvement for
the natural surroundings.
   RIBICOFF: There are 145 installations affected. There are 86 for
closure, five for partial closure, 54 bases have been realigned. The
estimation is $693 million saved per year in base operating costs
and $5.6 billion to be saved over 20 years on the net present value.
... There are about 20 major ones.
   EDWARDS: I guess generally you would look at the L.A. area _ Fort
George and the Air Force base in Norton. Generally, you would look
in Illinois at Chanute Field and Fort Sheridan. Generally, you would
probably look at Fort Devens in Massachusetts, the Washington
national capital region area which would include Meade, Belvoir and
Holabird. You would look at perhaps Pease Air Force Base up in New
Hampshire. I guess those are the big areas.
   RIBICOFF: It goes from page 52 to page 69 (in the report), and I
think you will find that to be a very accurate explanation of the
rationale and what is happening to those bases.
   EDWARDS: (Fort) Dix (N.J.) is going into what we call
``semi-active status.'' There will be a group of probably 500 or so
people there who will maintain it, have it available for Reserve
activity, have it available for active duty training from time to
time, have it available in the event troops are brought home from
some part of the world. It will be there to support McGuire Air
Force Base (and) the naval station at Lakehurst.
   We broke down all of the military facilities into various
categories. And in our breakdown, Dix came out at the bottom of the
list in a category where we had excess capacity _ basic training,
advanced individual training and these types of things.
   We have moved those kinds of activities from Dix to various
facilities in the country, some to Fort Knox, some to Fort Leonard
Wood, Mo., some to Fort Jackson, S.C. And in the process, we moved
some out of Fort Bliss in Texas, so all of it becomes compatible.
What we've tried to do is bring training areas together to the
extent that we could, where we could justify it.
   Q. You mentioned in your opening statement that you didn't expect
any of these (communities) to be adversely affected by this. I think
a lot of the communities will find that hard to swallow.
   EDWARDS: Of course they will. I said ``substantial socio-economic
impact.'' Of course they will have a hard time swallowing it. ...
There are some areas where the impact is obviously larger than
others. But we have a section in here ... that deals with ways in
which communities can help themselves when they feel this kind of
impact.
   The Office of Economic Adjustment in the Defense Department has a
great ability to move in and help a community work out its problems.
Where possible, we have not moved troops across the country but next
door, in the same state or in an adjoining state.
   Q. Perhaps you could tell me what sort of thinking went into your
decision to close the Presidio in San Francisco?
   EDWARDS: The Presidio sits in the middle of San Francisco or
thereabouts, and it can't grow. It can't do any more than it's
doing. There's no way it can expand. It's prohibited by laws of
California and other laws as far as expansion is concerned. It's in
a high-value area, and the operations at the Presidio can be done by
and large most anywhere.

<TEXT>
   Q. To what extent does the property value of these bases that
you've chosen play a role in your decision ... and how many total
jobs are we talking about here being lost?
   EDWARDS: The first thing we looked at was military value, without
a doubt. I mean, that was our touchstone. And if a base had military
value, then we didn't bother it. If the base was lacking in military
value, then it became a candidate to look at.
   We obviously did not ignore cost savings. We used ... as our
guideline a six-year payback, as set out in the charter. And so if a
facility did not meet the six-year payback, then it's not in our
list. In some instances, we looked at estimates as to what we could
sell the property for, but it was not the cornerstone of our
activity.
   Q. How about the jobs question?
   EDWARDS: I don't know whether we actually totaled all that.
You'll see a column that talks about personnel out and personnel in,
both military and civilian. And I think if you'll ust run your
finger down the column to the area you're looking for, you'll see
the impact.
   Q. Is this the end of it, in your mind? Or can a year from now a
similar commission come back and recommend a similar number of
bases? I mean, a $5.6 billion savings over a certain number of years
is rather insignificant when you consider the total defense budget.
   RIBICOFF: We think the basic responsibility should be in the
hands of the secretary of defense. There should be an ongoing study
to see what changes should be made in the bases. We've recommended
that there should be a high-level, small group of people to go over
this with the secretary of defense, but I would hope that there
wouldn't always be a commission like ours that would be necessary to
do the whole job over again.
   The training is altogether different with the new technology.
We're going to have to acquire larger tracts of land. Many of the
present bases are limited because they have been surrounded by large
urban areas and their effectiveness has been destroyed. So I think
the country is going to have to take a good, hard look, and the
Defense Department, as to what future training will have to be for
future wars and the changes that are going to take place.
   Q. Can you tell us what the up-front costs of closing and
realigning these bases are?
   EDWARDS: Well, let's see, the Najavo Army Depot in Arizona, just
to pull one out of there. It's going to cost $11 million to make
that move. But it will pay back in annual savings $3.05 million. And
so it's going to take us four years to recover that initial cost of
the move before we start making annual savings. But then they are
annual savings forever.
   Q. As two former members of Congress, how do you think ... the
reaction on the Hill will be to this?
   EDWARDS: I believe the leadership of the Armed Services
Committees, of both the House and the Senate, favor this exercise
taking place. There's no question that many congressmen and senators
are going to be upset when they see this list, especially if it
affects (their) community.
   I would anticipate, from my own general conversations ... from
the time we were appointed to the present, that Congress will accept
it.
   Q. There are some lawmakers, especially from California, who have
already argued that the ... the state has been unfairly hit here.
Your reaction to that?
   EDWARDS: A lot of the activity in Southern California that is
reported in here has to do with Norton and George. They are both
encroached by air traffic congestion from the L.A. airport. They
can't train adequately because of that problem. They both have major
problems in attracting high-technology employees because of the
activity in that area in the civilian sector. And we felt that we
really just had no alternative but to deal with that.
   Mather (Air Force Base, Calif.), they are a good distance away
from their training area. They have to fly over 150 nautical miles
just to get to the area where they train their particular aircraft
and pilots. We have moved them into Mountain Home, Idaho, where
there is an electronic training range right there. ... I like to
think there's a rationale to what we've done.
   RIBICOFF: I think they (the Air Force) recognize the great
changes that have taken place in training with the present type of
equipment and the present time of aircraft and what has happened in
the urban areas, and they realize that changes have to be made. And
California ... is the fastest growing state in the Union, when it
comes to urban encroachment and the elimination of open spaces that
air forces need.
   Q. What happens if the list is rejected by Congress? Will
   you gentlemen start over?
   EDWARDS: We are a one-shot, unique kind of an organization. When
we hand this report over, we are finished.

   Q. Congressman (Les) Aspin (D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee) suggested that there was a loophole in this
whole procedure and that funds had to be appropriated annually to
close these bases and, by use of that loophole, bases could be
prevented from being closed. Did you address that question and what
did you do about it?
   EDWARDS: There is a problem, because the proceeds of the sales of
these facilities will go into the fund to carry out the purposes of
this law. And those proceeds are not going to start coming in on Day
One. It's going to take a while to come in. And so we have
recommended in this report that Congress in (fiscal 1990)
appropriate $300 million to put the first money in the fund so we
can start the process. And obviously, if Congress refuses to
appropriate enough money to get ... the process going, then it's
going to be very difficult.
   Q. It's often said that certain bases have remained open over the
years for political or pork barrel reasons. Did you find any
evidence of that in your study? And how far have you gone to
eliminating it, if that's the case?
   RIBICOFF: I don't think there was any influence or any attempt to
protect pork barrel bases. I don't think that was taken into account
at all. I don't think anybody on the commission felt any pressure.
We looked at these bases seriously. We looked at all the figures. We
spent a lot of time in discussion. Each and every base was voted on
unanimously, with the action taken.
   EDWARDS: You should understand first that we simply did not start
with a list. ... We started with a set of criteria which we applied
to all 4,300 installations in this country. ... And we took those as
we found them.
   Q. There are four states that are missing _ West Virginia,
Mississippi, Georgia and Wisconsin, all home states of the chairmen
of the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. Were there no
bases in those states worthy of closing?
   EDWARDS: That's certainly not by design. We did take a little
something out of Fort McPherson in Georgia, I recall. I don't
believe we touched Wisconsin. West Virginia, I'm going to bet,
doesn't have a whole lot of military in the first place. ... We had
to deal with bases where we found them.
   Q. Could you please elaborate on some of the personnel changes
that are going to take place at Fort Devens and some of the other
bases that are getting increases of people?
   RIBICOFF: We found that certain missions were split between a
number of bases _ they didn't make any sense _ when they should have
been consolidated and put in one base. And what we did in many
instances, we just do that, and especially when you talk about Fort
Devens. ... You will find a shift from one fort to the other, one
base to the other, which will make it more effective, more
efficient, and be able to do a much better job with their mission.
   Q. I wonder if you had the opportunity to pass judgment on the
value of strategic home porting, to see whether dispersion of ships
offers protection in the nuclear age, or whether it's really just a
way of building local political support for various naval tasks.
   EDWARDS: I don't know anything that was discussed more than
strategic home porting. ... We concluded that our job was not to
deal with force structure. That's the military's job. ... Our job
was to try to deal with that force structure as we found it, and try
to accommodate it to the facilities that we were working with. And
so we had to live with the fact that there's going to be a 600-ship
Navy. Maybe there never will be... but we don't know that.
   So we had to look at the home ports with an idea where are you
going to put that other 150 ships that are building up from the
450-ship Navy. And we concluded that we could justify some home
ports, most of them.
   Q. If it were not for political constraints, could you actually
... expand your list? Are there a lot of other bases you consider
still vulnerable or could be effectively closed?
   EDWARDS: The biggest constraint ... is the six-year payback
constraint. We found a lot of facilities that had 10-year paybacks,
12-year paybacks, even 20-year paybacks, where we could have made
some major savings over a longer period of time. But we were
constrained by our charter, which had a six-year payback.
   RIBICOFF: Once you got over the six years, we had to stop. I
think wisdom and better planning would have been more meaningful if
we weren't stuck with that six-year payback.
   Q. In other words, some of these places survived because of
   their inefficiency?
   EDWARDS: No, I think it may cost a lot of money to move one
facility into another base and have to build all-new construction,
and your payback just simply won't make it.

   RIBICOFF: It just goes to prove that there's still a lot of work
to be done, and it should be ongoing. And I would hope the next
secretary of defense would take this job very, very seriously. ...
There's money to be saved. And with tight budget restraints, you're
going to have to save it wherever you can for basic important
purposes in the defense establishment.
   Q. Some of the bases are under construction, such as the naval
station in Galveston, Texas. What's the rationale for closing that?
The state of Texas has already spent $8 million building a highway
to it.
   EDWARDS: My recollection is that we could save $8 million a year
forever. (Laughter.) We concluded that Galveston was primarily a
reserve center in the home port plan, that Lake Charles had only had
one oiler and one minesweeper, and that they could be moved to
Engleside, so that we would put together in one place in Texas the
carrier, the battleship and the support ships. That's the West Gulf.
Then on the East Gulf, you would have the
Pascagoula-Mobile-Pensacola complex. So you'd have two complexes on
the Gulf instead of whatever they were.
   Q. Some of the bases have been on hit lists. Things have changed
over the years. The base that led to the obstructing legislation was
Loring Air Force Base in Maine. What has changed over the years to
make that cold-weather base, which was considered obsolete in 1977,
necessary now?
   REP. EDWARDS: I can't give you chapter and verse, because it
didn't come through on our six-year payback. ... One of the things
we had to deal with was the fact that a lot of the bases that were
along the coast, such as Pease, the airplanes that would go in a
base like that are better centrally located in the United States
because of the time it takes for the Soviets or some enemy to get a
missile lobbed in. And you don't need them right up on the front
lines anymore.
   Q. Did you at all assess the impact on defense contractors that
support these facilities?
   EDWARDS: We did not.
   RIBICOFF: No.
   Q. I could not find Fort Monroe (Va.) anywhere. Who saved it?
   EDWARDS: Me. (Laughter.) I personally went to Fort Monroe to look
at it. And I saw the moat and ... the old historic buildings. ... I
also saw what would amount to around $900 million in cleanup costs
to get rid of the old shells that had been lobbed over on part of
that fort for the last 200 years or however long it was. I also saw
the cost of building new facilities to house all of those people _
3,000 or 4,000 people as I recall _ and it just didn't even come
close to our six-year payback. It was more like a 20-year payback at
best. And in part because there's no real market value for that
property. It would become, perhaps, a museum one day. ... I don't
know any developer in his right mind who would want to go in there
and buy that property.

<HEAD>Americans, Vietnamese To Excavate Remains Of Giant Ape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American scientists today said they will
join Vietnamese archeologists in a remote cave outside Hanoi to
search for remains of the largest known ape _ a 9-foot primate that
became extinct 200,000 years ago.
   The excavation, planned for Jan. 4-28, is being billed as the
first field research project involving scientists of the two
countries since the beginning of the war in Indochina.
   Paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon said he and three other
Americans would join about 10 Vietnamese scientists at the limestone
cave where remains have been found of the ``Gigantopithecus,'' an
ape known only from sites in southern China and Vietnam.
   Despite some earlier research by Vietnamese, East German and
French scientists, very little is known about the giant, which is
related to the orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla.
   Only jawbones and teeth of the animal have been uncovered but
Ciochon said the team hoped to find more remains in the cave, 75
miles southwest of Hanoi, which served as a weapons depot and bomb
shelter during the Vietnam War.
   ``One thing we know about it is that it was very big,'' Ciochon
told reporters. It was probably a four-footed, vegetarian animal
weighing about 770 pounds that became extinct 200,000 to 300,000
years ago, the Americans said.
   There is speculation early man may have hunted the ape to
extinction. The team hopes to establish relationships between ``homo
erectus,'' the direct ancestor of modern humans, stone tools used by
early man and the giant ape since the remains of all three have been
found in the area of the cave.
   Ciochon, from the University of Iowa, said the Americans were
bringing in special rock saws and generators for the excavation. He
said these would be turned over to Vietnamese counterparts when the
Americans returned home.
   Two Vietnamese scientists are to visit the United States later,
bringing fossils from the excavation site.
   The National Geographic Society, which is sending a team to
Vietnam to film a documentary on the excavation, is the main backer
of the expedition.
   Although the United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic
relations, informal exchanges have increased the past two years.
However, Hanoi permits far more American academics, journalists and
others to visit Vietnam than Washington does Vietnamese to enter the
United States.
   Ciochon said members of his team had visited Vietnam in 1987 and
1988 for preliminary surveys.
   Ciochon said research on the Gigantopithecus in China has been
hampered by site disturbances: remains of the ape have been ground
up to be sold as medicine.
   In Vietnam, he said, this practice does not exist and the
potential of finding substantial fossil remains is considerable.
   Other American members of the expedition are Ms. K. Semendeferi
of the University of Iowa and John Olsen and Mary Kay Gilliland
Olsen of the University of Arizona. The Vietnamese scientists come
from the Institute of Archaeology in Hanoi.

<HEAD>Government Recaptures Outposts After Bloody Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government forces have recaptured a
strategic area from Karen insurgents after three months of fighting
that claimed at least 444 lives, a government spokesman said today.
   The government launched its offensive at Methawaw on Dec. 16 and
retook the three outposts on Christmas Eve, spokesman Kyaw Sann told
a weekly news briefing.
   The Karens, probably the strongest of the dozen guerrilla groups
fighting the government, claims to control most of the 1,350-mile
frontier with Thailand. This ethnic minority group has been fighting
for greater autonomy since 1949.
   Until government forces first captured it in 1984, the Methawaw
area served as a key transport and communications route for the
Karens. In that area, they also acquired funds for their insurgency
by taxing those responsible for the smuggling of narcotics between
Burma and Thailand.
   The Karens seized three of the five government outposts there
last September but the government then sent in large numbers of
reinforcements.
   The spokesman said the two sides fought 85 ``major battles'' and
145 other engagements in three months. The area is on the west bank
of the Moei River separating Burma and Thailand, and 130 miles
northwest of Rangoon.
   He said 240 government soldiers, including 12 officers, were
killed and 922 wounded.
   The spokesman said the bodies of 204 rebels had been counted as
of Saturday. Seized from them, he said, was a large amount of
automatic weapons, hand grenades and ammunition.

<HEAD>Labor Department Considers Lifting Homework Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department plans hearings early next
year to discuss lifting a World War II-era regulation that bars
apparel manufacturers from employing seamstresses in their homes.
   The department planned to publish in today's edition of the
Federal Register an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as the
first formal step for lifting the ban, said Allan McMillan, a deputy
assistant labor secretary in charge of enforcing the prohibition.
   President-elect Bush urged the action last October after the
Labor Department won approval from the White House budget office to
remove homework prohibitions in five other apparel fields effective
Jan. 8.
   McMillan said the Labor Department will hold hearings on the
proposal in Miami on Feb. 22-23; in San Antonio, Texas, on March
2-3; and in Chicago on March 8-9.
   The prohibitions on apparel industry homework were imposed in
1942 to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other
low-wage workers. Lifting them has been the Reagan administration's
top deregulatory proposal in the labor relations area for the past
several years.
   The International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which represents
some 170,000 workers, said last week it will seek a court injunction
next week to prohibit the further removal of any of the remaining
bans on homework.

<HEAD>Gay Midshipman Sues For Reinstatement</HEAD>

   A gay midshipmen who says he was forced to
resign from the Naval Academy after admitting his homosexuality has
asked a federal court to order his reinstatement.
   Joseph C. Steffan, 24, of Moorhead, Minn., claimed in the suit
filed Thursday in U.S. District Court that his ``forced separation''
from the academy two months before his scheduled graduation violated
his constitutional rights of free speech, due process and equal
protection under the law.
   Steffan, now employed by a computer software company in Fargo,
N.D., acknowledged that he was aware of a provision in the
midshipmen's manual that homosexuals would be dismissed from the
academy.
   Jay Fromer, a spokesman for the Naval Academy, said the school
only abided by Navy regulations.
   ``Since we are a part of the Department of the Navy, we are bound
by Navy regulations which state homosexuality is incompatible with
military service,'' Fromer said.

   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety

   The proposal would affect fully cooked, partially cooked and
``char-marked'' ground meat patties.
   The proposed rule would establish requirements for the storage of
raw ingredients, processing times and temperatures, handling to
prevent contamination after processing, and labels that include
cooking instruction for final preparation.

<HEAD>Racial Strife Spreads To Hangzhou Over AIDS Rumor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Racial strife involving African students has
spread to a second Chinese city, with Africans at a university in
Hangzhou protesting rumors they were carriers of the disease AIDS.
   About 65 Africans attending Zhejiang Agriculture University in
Hangzhou have stayed in their dormitory since Monday, boycotting
classes and demanding to leave China, a student from Cameroon said.
   He said university officials have blocked attempts to leave the
eastern Chinese city.
   The student, speaking on condition of anonymity, said university
officials had implied they were carriers of the fatal disease AIDS.
``They treat us like criminals,'' he said.
   Further details of the dispute were inpeded by poor telephone
connections. University officials were not available for comment.
   Hangzhou is about 140 miles southeast of Nanking, scene of five
days of anti-African demonstrations stemming from a Christmas Eve
fight between African students and Chinese.
   Chinese officials have isolated about 140 African students and
other foreign sympathizers in a remote guest house outside the city
to protect them from Chinese demonstrators demanding Africans
responsible for injuring 11 Chinese be brought to justice.
   The Chinese side has refused the Africans' request to leave
Nanking, and only those students who agree to return to their
schools are being allowed to leave the guest house. Almost all the
Africans say they fear for their safety and will not return to the
city.
   The Xinhua Daily, Nanking's leading daily, ran a front-page story
today for the second straight day expressing understanding for the
anger of the Chinese youth and saying, ``The troublemakers, a
minority of foreign students, will be punished.''
   ``Africans come from developing countries and are struggling,''
the article said. ``This is not easy ... but China will not forgive
those students who break China's law.''
   The story also appealed for calm, and quoted professors from
Nanking Teachers College as saying, ``We mustn't turn a school's
problem into a social problem.''
   Yang Ruiju, president of Hehai University, said Thursday that no
Chinese would be punished for breaking windows and destroying
property at the African students dormitory during the Christmas Eve
brawl.
   Yang said seven or eight Africans were being investigated for
their involvement in the fight, which began when Africans refused to
register the names of their Chinese girlfriends they were taking to
a campus party.
   A Palestinian student in Nanking said today that Chinese who
visited the guest house the previous day had been told seven
Africans, the same ``troublemakers'' referred to by Yang, had been
separated from the other foreign students.
   There are an estimated 1,500 Africans from 40 nations studying at
Chinese universities.
   China has long provided scholarships for Africans in solidarity
with developing African states, but social tensions, which Africans
attribute to ingrained racial prejudices against blacks, have
occasionally flared out into violence between the Chinese and
Africans.

<HEAD>Abe Stolar, Family Finally Given Permission To Emigrate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with quotes. No pickup. ADDS byline</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago-born Abe Stolar said today his family has
received permission to emigrate and that he would finally be leaving
the Soviet Union for the first time in more than a half-century.
   ``There's no feeling yet. It's just a big mess thinking of all
the things we have to do,'' Stolar said in perfect English in a
telephone call.
   The long struggle came to an end when Stolar's daughter-in-law
received word she would be allowed to join the rest of the family in
emigrating. Stolar, his wife and son received exit visas in 1975 but
his daughter-in-law was not given a visa, so the family decided not
to leave.
   Stolar's case has been the subject of negotiations between the
United States and the Soviets for years and its resolution was
another in a series of Kremlin moves to improve the country's human
rights record.
   Numerous prominent refuseniks, or Jews denied permission to
emigrate, have been allowed to leave since Mikhail S. Gorbachev took
power in March 1985.
   Stolar, a 77-year-old Jew, has not been out of the Soviet Union
since his parents, ardent American Communists, brought him here in
1931.
   His parents left the American Depression behind to help build the
new Soviet Union, but in 1937, his father disappeared in one of
dictator Josef Stalin's bloody purges.
   Stolar, who still holds U.S. citizenship, served with the Red
Army during World War II and afterward became an announcer and
translator for Radio Moscow.
   ``I have news now,'' an excited Stolar said in beginning the
phone call.
   He explained that he was numb after learning his family could
leave.
   ``They drag it out so long. It's been 13{ years. They try to drag
it out. The main thing now is to try to be calm and not to forget
anything, which is hard.''
   His 29-year-old son, Michael, said he was not very excited.
   ``I have no special feelings,'' he said. ``Perhaps in some time I
will feel happy, but now perhaps it's shock. I can't say I am happy
but I cannot say I am not happy.''
   The younger Stolar said he was probably reserved because he was
worried about friends who are having trouble emigrating, and who are
not getting the support like his family did from the U.S. government.
   Michael Stolar said his wife, Julia Shurukht, had telephoned
OVIR, the government agency that handles emigration matters, on
Monday and Tuesday. A deputy chief of the office said she would be
allowed to join the family in emigrating. A postcard confirming the
verbal notification is expected to arrive next week, and then the
family plans to fly to Israel, he said.
   After getting settled in Israel, the family plans to make their
first trip to the United States, to visit friends.
   The latest in a series of snags that held up Ms. Shurukht's
emigration was that her mother refused to sign a form saying her
daughter did not have any financial obligations to her. Abe Stolar
said the mother apparently has now signed the form.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Evans' Third-Party Candidacy Will Hurt Blacks' Chances</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political analyst says Alderman Timothy Evans'
third-party bid for mayor may wind up accomplishing the very things
he hoped to avoid _ splitting the black vote and returning a Daley
to city hall.
   Evans announced Thursday that he was withdrawing from February's
Democratic primary to run in the general election as the candidate
of the Harold Washington Party, which he created and named after
Chicago's first black mayor.
   That leaves Mayor Eugene Sawyer, Evans' chief black rival, in a
primary showdown against Richard M. Daley, Cook County prosecutor
and son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ruled Chicago for
more than two decades.
   Evans repeatedly said he was not endorsing Sawyer in the primary,
but urged supporters to ``do whatever they can do to defeat Daley,''
who according to early polls is the front-runner among announced
candidates.
   Evans may ultimately regret both positions, said Eugene Kennedy,
a Loyola University professor, author of a biography of the elder
Daley and a veteran political observer.
   ``He urged black voters to keep away from Sawyer,'' Kennedy said.
``Then he made repeated references to Daley as though he were
somehow evil ... and that all whites, by implication, were somehow
`the enemy.'
   ``On the one hand, he weakens the very cause he purports to
support _ a black mayor for Chicago. On the other, he's galvanized
the (white ethnic) opposition,'' Kennedy said.
   Evans, 45, was Washington's floor leader in the City Council and
has tried since the late mayor's death to portray himself as heir to
Washington's legacy as a reformer.
   Sawyer, 54, was chosen to succeed Washington by many of the same
City Council members who were Washington's staunchest opponents. He
and Evans have waged a costly struggle for the loyalty of the black
community.
   Evans said some believed Sawyer should have withdrawn from the
primary ``because it is clear from all the available evidence I am
the choice of an overwhelming majority of our coalition.
   ``But as he has refused to do so, I will make that move _ secure
in the knowledge that I am at once serving, uniting and leading our
great coalition on a course that will result in a historic
victory,'' he added.
   The Daley and Sawyer camps expressed little surprise at Evans'
move Thursday.
   ``Mr. Daley has said all along that what's important are the
issues _ crime, education and health _ not who's in or who's out or
what the numbers are,'' said Daley spokeswoman Marj Halperin.
   ``Mayor Sawyer did not expect Tim Evans' endorsement in the
primary and he'd have been surprised if there was one,'' said a
Sawyer spokesman who refused to be identified.
   ``The mayor felt all along the important thing was to remove the
onus from both himself and Mr. Evans of splitting the black vote,''
the spokesman said. That was everybody's greatest fear and that has
now been removed.''

<HEAD>Students Return To Capital After Fleeing Military Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-six students who fled Burma's
military crackdown flew home today, and authorities allowed a
one-month extension for thousands of others to return from the Thai
border region.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told reporters the government had
extended its deadline from Saturday to Jan. 31 for the students to
return.
   A Burmese air force plane brought back the second group of
students since the government announced all students who fled after
the Sept. 18 military coup and had sought haven could return without
retribution.
   A group of 80 students arrived in Rangoon on Monday from a
special transition camp in the northern Thai city of Tak, near
guerrilla-held border areas.
   Among the second group was Aung Mo Myint, 20. His elder brother
had returned on Monday, and at that time their father made an
emotional plea for the return of his other son.
   Aung Mo Myint wept when he asked a reporter about his father, and
was told of the plea.
   He said he did not accompany his brother earlier because, ``I was
skeptical about the government's intention. I am now convinced that
it is genuine, and we are safe to be back in our country. I am sure
others will also return. We heard on the radio about the receptions
here.''
   Another student, Hkun Thaung Myine, said he felt sorry for his
colleagues left behind, some of whom he said ``may have difficulties
in escaping from the rebels.''
   Thai officials said 19 other students remained in the camp in
Tak, including some whose departures were delayed because they were
waiting for friends and relatives still staying with Burmese
insurgents along the border. They estimate 7,000 students remain
along the border.
   University students led massive nationwide demonstrations for
democracy in Burma until the new military authorities crushed the
protests.
   Many of the students found jungle life too harsh or said the
guerrillas mistreated them.
   The protests prompted the resignation in July of Ne Win, who
overthrew a civilian government in 1962 and led Burma's only
political party since then. In August, Maung Maung became Burma's
first civilian leader in 26 years, declared an end to a multiparty
state and promised elections.
   He was overthrown by army Gen. Saw Maung a month later. Saw Maung
also has promised elections but has not issued a date for elections.
   The agreement to repatriate the students was reached by Saw Maung
and Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the Thai army chief who on Dec. 14
became the first high foreign official to visit Burma since the coup.

<HEAD>Rain Drenches Pacific Northwest; Atlantic Coast To Central Plains
Fair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain drenched the Pacific Northwest and snow spread from the
Cascades into western Montana today as much of the nation from the
Atlantic Coast to the central Plains enjoyed fair weather.
   More than 2{ inches of rain fell Thursday at Astoria, Ore., as
snow caused major problems farther inland.
   A blizzard forced Oregon authorities to close part of Interstate
84, stranding holiday travelers along a 170-mile stretch of the
highway.
   Blowing snow reduced visibility to near zero, prompting the state
Highway Division to close the freeway about 9:30 a.m. Thursday.
Troopers patrolling the nearly deserted highway reported continuing
poor conditions 12 hours after the freeway was closed.
   Local officials said about 50 people spent the night at the local
armory, 60 to 75 stayed at a local Baptist church, a dozen stayed in
a local crisis action center, and an unknown number of private homes
were opened to travelers.
   Spokane, Wash., received 3 more inches of new snow Thursday
evening, leaving 8 total inches on the ground thus far.
   Snow and freezing rain advisories continued for the Cascade
mountains through the night. Up to 10 inches of new snow was
expected in the higher Cascade passes; freezing rain in the lower
passes.
   Snow spread into western Montana, and gusty winds up to 81 mph
also hit western and central Montana.
   Clouds and isolated rain spread across southern Texas and
Louisiana, and snow showers were scattered in the upper Mississippi
Valley and northern Great Lakes region. Snow showers also lingered
in parts of New York state.
   High pressure dominated from the Atlantic Coast into the central
Plains, providing fair weather.
   The nation's high Thursday was 84 degrees at Fort Myers and
Miami, both in Florida.
   Today's forecast called for rain in the Pacific Northwest, snow
in the northern Rockies and northern parts of the Great Basin and
northern Plains; showers and thunderstorms from eastern Texas across
the lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee Valley; snow showers
in Upper Michigan and southern Wisconsin.
   The remainder of the nation was expected to have fair weather.
   Predicted highs: single digits and teens in northern Maine; the
teens from eastern Montana across North Dakota and northern
Minnesota into western Upper Michigan; 20s and 30s in much of the
Rockies, South Dakota, the remainder of Minnesota and middle
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley, the
Middle Atlantic States and the remainder of New England; 60s and 70s
from south-central Texas across the Gulf Coast region to the
southern Atlantic Coast and northern Florida; the low 80s in
southern Florida. The rest of the country should reach the 40s and
50s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 12 degrees
below zero at International Falls, Minn., to 74 at Homestead, Fla.

   Two tractor-trailers, one loaded with
butter, collided and burst into flames on Interstate 15, killing one
driver and greasing the desert roadway with melted butter, officials
said.
   The accident happened Thursday night in a northbound lane
reserved for trucks ascending a grade of Interstate 15, said Highway
Patrol spokesman Antonio Gonzalez.
   One rig rear-ended the other 17 miles north of this desert
community and 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles, according to
Gonzalez.
   The highway, made slick by butter melted in the fire, was closed
about 15 minutes. One lane was reopened, and state Department of
Transportation workers coated the other lanes with sand.
   The name of the driver killed in the accident was not immediately
available.

   A college lecturer was cleared of
charges he made a bomb threat on an American Airlines flight after
an 11-year-old boy admitted he wrote the note and left it on the
aircraft, says an apologetic FBI.
   Charges against Peter W. Canning, a lecturer in literature at the
University of California-Berkeley, were dropped Thursday after the
boy told the FBI he wrote the note.
   Canning, 40, found the note on an American Airlines jetliner
Tuesday, gave it to a flight attendant and was arrested by the FBI.
   The FBI's top New Mexico agent, Jim Nelson, said he ``regrets any
inconvenience and embarassment suffered by Mr. Canning.''
   ``However, the investigation fully warranted the arrest of
Canning, which occurred after consulting with the U.S. attorney's
office in Albuquerque,'' Nelson said.
   Canning, a Harvard doctoral candidate, could not be reached for
comment because he was driving home to Berkeley when the charges
were dropped by U.S. Magistrate Sumner G. Buell in Albuquerque. He
had been released on his own recognizance the previous day.
   Canning had insisted all along that the note fell into his lap
from his seat tray while lunch was being served on the flight from
San Francisco to Dallas. He handed the note to a flight attendant,
who notified the pilot.
   The plane was diverted to Albuquerque and was searched for about
four hours with bomb-sniffing dogs.
   The boy came forward with his parents Thursday, and admitted
writing the note during a flight to San Francisco earlier Tuesday,
said FBI spokesman Douglas Beldon. The note was put on the pullout
tray before it was stowed away, he said.
   The note said: ``Read this. There are guns pointed at you. If you
want to live, read the letter underneath and do what it says. This
is a bomb scare. Read this. PS If you do what the letter says, and
have everyone else do it, you will live. PS If you don't, you are
history!! There are bombs planted all over this airplane and there
is a gun pointed at your head. Take your wallet and throw it in the
aisle now.''
   At the time of the arrest, federal agents said there were
similarities between Canning's handwriting and the note.
   Agents determined that the boy sat in the seat later occupied by
Canning, Beldon said. He said the U.S. attorney's office in San
Francisco declined to prosecute the boy.
   Canning's attorney, Ray Twohig, had said the arrest resulted from
FBI confusion. ``I'm glad they've cleared up their confusion,'' he
said Thursday.
   Asked if the crash of a Pan Am jumbo jet in Scotland last week
might have affected the way this case was handled, Twohig said:
``Sure, everybody was jumpy.
   ``I just hope that people who read about this and hear about this
aren't discouraged from reporting things,'' Twohig said. Canning has
said he almost withheld the note.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in early European trading
today, losing more than 1 cent against the British pound. Gold
prices were mixed.
   Trading was thin on the last business day of 1988, giving some
transactions an exaggerated effect on rates, foreign currency
dealers said.
   ``The market is already semi-closed,'' said one dealer in Rome.
Banks have only skeleton staffs on duty and are limiting business to
postition-squaring and to serving corporate customers with some
last-minute requirements, he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.13 yen to close the year at 125.90 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 125.42 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.7798 West German marks, down from 1.7875
   _1.5065 Swiss francs, down from 1.5125
   _6.0795 French francs, down from 6.0975
   _2.0118 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0190
   _1,313.00 Italian lire, down from 1,314.50
   _1.1910 Canadian dollars, down from 1.191225
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8015, compared with $1.7900
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $409.50 a troy ounce, up
from $408.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $410.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.50, down from $410.75 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.63 to close at a bid $412.44.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.03 a troy ounce,
down from Thursday's $6.04.

<HEAD>Pepperidge Farm To Remove Tropical Oils From Crackers, Cookies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent $2 million to pressure the
food industry into making healthier products says he's pleasantly
surprised by Pepperidge Farm's decision to stop using coconut oil in
crackers and cookies.
   ``Ultimately Pepperidge Farms will have saved thousands of
lives,'' Phil Sokolof said Thursday.
   Coconut oil is a saturated fat that raises cholesterol levels.
People who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of
clogged arteries that can lead to heart disease.
   Pepperidge Farm announced Wednesday that it would stop using
coconut oil in numerous products, including its popular ``Original
Goldfish,'' in response to ``strong consumer concern.''
   ``Frankly, I'm surprised, because Pepperidge Farm has a
multimillion-dollar undertaking on their hands to change their
products,'' said Sokolof, founder of the Nebraska-based National
Heart Savers.
   Pepperidge Farm will have to come up with new recipes for more
than 50 brands of cookies and crackers, said Sokolof, whose group
has campaigned against products using tropical oils.
   ``We must find oils that will proximate tropical oils in terms of
performance in the baking process, flavor, texture, mouth-feel and
shelf-life stability,'' Richard A. Shea, president of the
Norwalk-based company, said in a statement issued Wednesday.
   Coconut and palm oil are popular with food manufacturers because
they help extend the shelf life of food products, Sokolof said.
   Many products advertised as being free of cholesterol contain
tropical oils that can help cholesterol form after consumption, he
said. Coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat than lard.
   Sokolof placed advertisments in newspapers in October depicting
nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods, but are
``poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats.
   A 65-year-old multimillionaire who nearly died from a heart
attack in 1966, Sokolof has spent $2 million to pressure food
industry giants into making healthier products. His father and a
brother-in-law died of heart attacks.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea is producing
chemical weapons at eight plants and organizing chemical warfare
units to help maintain superiority over South Korean and U.S.
forces, officials said today.
   A report by the South Korean Defense Ministry disclosed for the
first time that North Korea was producing chemical weapons,
including poison gas, at eight cities, including Sinhung and Sinuju.
   Chemical weapons would probably be used to knock out South Korean
and U.S. forces as part of lightning attacks if the North invaded,
officials said. The United States has 42,000 troops based in the
South under a defense pact.
   The report, part of an overview on South and North Korean
military forces, said the North also has six storage sites for
chemical weapons and three research and development centers.
   Storage centers are located near the South Korean border for
possible use in a war, the report said. Chemical weapons factories
are based in the north of the country, with many close to the
Chinese and Soviet borders, it said.
   U.S. military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said they were aware of reports of North Korea's chemical warfare
capability, but declined to comment further.
   North Korea had formed chemical warfare units and attached them
to infantry regiments, officials said. The North is expected to
eventually deploy chemical, they said.
   The North is also producing Soviet-designed ``Scud'' and ``Frog''
missiles with ranges of up to 180 miles that could be used to
deliver chemical warheads, officials said.
   The officials could not say when chemical weapons might be
deployed by North Korea. They noted that the North had been
developing chemical weapons since the 1960s.
   South Korean and U.S. forces have anti-chemical warfare gear,
such as gas masks and chemical warfare suits. The two governments
decline to say if they deploy chemical weapons in South Korea.
   U.S. forces in South Korea reportedly possess battlefield nuclear
weapons, but Washington refuses to confirm or deny the reports.
   The South Korean report noted that Seoul is making advances in
building up its defenses and expects to end the North's military
superiority by the start of the next century.
   But it said that North Korea still has a substantial edge in
troops and weapons and was producing large numbers of tanks,
artillery pieces, rockets and other weapons.
   North and South Korea have been conducting talks aimed at easing
tensions, but the bitter rivals have hundreds of thousands of
heavily-armed troops poised along their border.
   The two nations were formed after U.S. and Soviet forces ended
the Japanese occupation at the end of the Second World War in 1945.
North Korea invaded the South in 1950, prompting the bloody
three-year Korean War.

<HEAD>Woodward Says Late Justice Was Source For Supreme Court Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporter Bob Woodward has revealed that the late
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was the confidential
source for his best-selling insider's look at the high court, ``The
Brethren.''
   In an interview published in the February issue of Playboy
magazine, The Washington Post reporter said he was willing to
identify Stewart because the former justice is dead. Stewart died in
1985 at age 70.
   ``I'm revealing his name now, for the first time, because it's
worth showing that there really are sources, people do talk,''
Woodward said.
   ``It's not some reporter's imagination or some letter that comes
in the mail with no address, typed on a standard typewriter,''
Woodward said. ``You have relationships, you nurture them and they
pay off.''
   Woodward said he met Stewart at a party in the spring of 1977.
``The Brethren'' was published in 1979.
   Although Woodward was willing to identify his main source for
``The Brethren,'' which he wrote with reporter Scott Armstrong, he
told Playboy he was not ready to identify ``Deep Throat.''
   ``Deep Throat'' was the key informer Woodward and Carl Bernstein
used for their Pulitzer Prize-winning articles uncovering the 1972
Watergate scandal in Post and for their subsequent best-selling
book, ``All the President's Men.''
   ``As you know, I'm not going to discuss the identity of Deep
Throat or any other of my confidential sources who are still
alive,'' Woodward said.
   Woodward said Stewart turned out to have ``real intellectual
disdain'' for former Chief Justice Warren Burger and former Attorney
General John Mitchell, both appointees of President Richard Nixon.
   Woodward said Stewart's animosities became clear as he worked on
the book, and were probably the reason Stewart allowed him to have a
behind-the-scenes look at the high court.
   ``What also came across ... was Stewart's contempt for Richard
Nixon,'' Woodward said. ``He felt that what had happened with Carl's
(Bernstein) and my Watergate reporting was very important for the
country and for journalism and for subduing this rightist movement
in America, tamping it down and saying `Whoa.' The guys who had
proclaimed they were going to fight crime turned out to be the
criminals.''

<TEXT>
   Eleven people were killed and 20
others injured when an explosion blew up a house where illegal
fireworks were being made, police said today.
   About 10 people were making firecrackers and sparklers late
Thursday in a house in this town 15 miles north of Manila when two
barrels of powder ignited, destroying the residence and four others
in the neighborhood.
   The explosion, heard several miles away, triggered a fire that
damaged five other homes before authorities could extinguish the
blaze.
   Police said five of the dead, including three who were
dismembered, were killed instantly, while the rest died in nearby
hospitals.
   Such explosions are annual occurrences in Bulacan province, the
center of the country's flourishing but illegal fireworks industry.
Two similar accidents killed 15 people last year.
   ``I am appalled by this kind of destruction,'' said Bulacan Gov.
Roberto Pagdanganan, who visited the scene early today.
   Pagdanganan said the explosion occurred only about an hour after
he warned Bocaue authorities to crack down on the industry, outlawed
in the mid-1960s after a series of deadly explosions and fires.

   Two French girls held hostage in Lebanon for 13
months by a Palestinian terrorist group rejoined their father and
went into seclusion today in France. Their hometown, meanwhile,
prepared a homecoming celebration.
   The long journey home took Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and her sister
Virginie, 6, by boat from Lebanon to Libya, where they were turned
over to French officials and flown to France late Thursday.
   Their hometown of Ollioules, near Toulon, set up welcoming
banners and French flags on its streets today. Mayor Rene Arnaud
said the town would give the girls a belated Christmas celebration.
   Left behind in the hands of Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary
Council, a Palestinian guerrilla organization, was their mother,
Jacqueline Valente; a baby sister born in captivity; and five
Belgians also seized aboard the yacht Silco off Israel's occupied
Gaza Strip.
   Their captors, who have been blamed for numerous terrorist
attacks, said the girls' freedom was a gift to France from the
children of the yearlong Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   French newspapers today suggested the release was a propaganda
ploy by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi to improve his image at a
time when the U.S. government has raised concerns about an alleged
chemical weapons plant in Libya. The Palestinian kidnappers are
backed by Libya.
   Marie-Laure, Virginie and their father, Pascal Betille, arrived
in a French government plane at a secluded military base near
Marseille, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. They were then taken
to a hospital for checkups and then to a secret location for sleep.
   The girls, dressed in dark robes, their shoulders draped with
plaid Arab scarves, had been reunited with their father hours
earlier in the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
   Betille's lawyer, Yves Massiani, said Thursday night that the
children had said nothing of their detention, ``talking only of
their boat trip.''
   Gadhafi called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve, and on
two occasions they were reported freed and en route home. The
Palestinian group has ties to Libya.
   ``France ... welcomes this humanitarian gesture in appropriate
measure,'' the Foreign Ministry said. ``It thanks foreign
authorities who contributed,'' it added without elaboration.
   A statement in Beirut by Fatah-Revolutionary Council spokesman
Walid Khaled said the girls' release was ``a gift to the French
authorities ... in the name of the children of Palestine, the
children of the Revolution of the Stones on the occasion of
Christmas and New Year.''
   Khaled said Saturday the girls would be freed following a call
from Gadhafi. In the following days, he said they were en route home.
   But when there was no sign of the children, the initial suspense
turned to confusion and despair for relatives who spent the
Christmas weekend in Beirut seeking the children's release.
   There was no immediate comment from the children's relatives
about their arrival.
   A later dispatch by the official Libyan news agency reported a
call from Gadhafi to ``liberation movements'' to free all hostages.
   ``Once again, I ask the Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the rest
of the liberation movements in the Middle East to respond to my
appeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holy
occasion,'' JANA quoted him as saying. ``Holy occasion'' was
apparently a reference to Christmas.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council announced the capture of the hostages
in a yacht off the Gaza Strip on Nov. 8, 1987. It accused the
captives of spying for Israel, a charge Israel and the family has
denied.
   The group has been blamed for dozens of hijackings, bombings and
assassinations since it broke with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in 1976.
   Ms. Valente, who is separated from the father of Marie-Laure and
Virginie, gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in a
recent videotape that she is pregnant again.
   The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners held
hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions.

   When baggage and wreckage from the Pan Am crash was
sent to Fort Halstead for forensic tests, some experts said they
believed even more strongly that a bomb destroyed the plane.
   They knew that Fort Halstead meant the Ministry of Defense's
leading bomb experts would be entering the investigation into the
Dec. 21 crash of the Boeing 747.
   Their work at the country's main center for developing explosives
and armaments proved crucial when it was determined that a bomb
caused the crash, and could help determine the bombers as well,
experts said Thursday.
   ``The tests were crucial in clinching the cause, i.e., that it
was a bomb,'' said a spokesman from the Department of Transport,
whose Air Accident Investigation Branch is heading the crash
investigation.
   Working closely with the Department of Transport, mainly civilian
experts at Fort Halstead will continue tests on wreckage from the
plane, he said.
   Fort Halstead is the high-security headquarters of the Royal
Armament Research and Development Establishment, the government's
center for research on defense projects ranging from new weapons to
bridges and computers.
   A Ministry of Defense spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, refused to comment in detail about the explosives experts
among the 2,500 civilians and 200 military at Fort Halstead and
three other sites operated by the establishment.
   Explosives work centers around Fort Halstead, near Sevenoaks in
Kent about 20 miles southeast of London.
   ``It's a high-security installation, which is very expert in
matters of explosives and armaments research,'' said Paul Wilkinson,
a professor and terrorism expert at Aberdeen University in Scotland.
   ``Their reputation is extremely high,'' he said in an interview,
adding that Fort Halstead experts would have worked closely with
experts in the Scottish town of Lockerbie, which bore the brunt of
the crash, to get a ``broader picture'' of the crash.
   David Learmount, air transport editor of the respected aviation
journal Flight International, said that when investigators announced
they were taking a suitcase and pieces of wreckage to Fort Halstead
for tests, he knew they were looking for ``symptoms of an
explosion.''
   Investigators said the tests found residues of explosives in two
parts of a ``luggage pallet'' _ the metal rack in the baggage hold
in which luggage is stored. But they said they still didn't know
where the bomb was planted and how it was brought aboard.
   Ian Geldard, head of research at the privately funded Institute
For The Study of Terrorism in London, said establishment experts
would probably next try to find out where the bomb was planted and
what type of bomb was used as a clue to identifying the bombers.
   ``Many terrorist groups have a particular type of favorite
explosive they use,'' he said.

   A bomb exploded today near a newsstand in a Tel
Aviv suburb, and police said they suspected ultra-Orthodox militants
were trying to block the sale of papers they consider pornographic.
   The bomb exploded in Ramat Gan, causing no injuries but minor
damage to a store, and police demolition experts dismantled four
bombs in nearby Bnei Brak, police spokesman Dalia Gilad said.
   She said different types of bombs were used, but that at least
one was a firebomb. Israel radio described it as a firebomb equipped
with a timer.
   Gilad said no group claimed responsibility, but police suspect it
was the work of ultra-Orthodox militants.
   ``The bombs were all found in places where secular newspapers are
sold,'' Gilad said.
   Ultra-Orthodox Jews object to pictures that show unmarried men
and women together, or women in revealing clothing.
   The deputy mayor of Bnai Brak, Shmuel Weinberg, said the
attempted bombings were the work of ``disturbed people'' and were
not sanctioned by the religious community.
   ``According to our past experience, when the police did catch
somebody, they were disturbed people who saw the bombings as some
kind of a religious commandment,'' he said.
   Last August, five bombs were placed near newsstands in Bnei Brak.
Three of the bombs exploded, causing minor damage but no injuries,
and two were dismantled by police.
   The ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party condemned the latest
bombing attempts, saying they violated Jewish scriptures.
   ``Violence is not the way of the Torah,'' the party said in a
statement. ``We are convinced that it was done by radicals rejected
by the Orthodox public.''

   Debbie Day says her father was apparently
trying to relieve her of the hardship of caring for a handicapped
child when he killed his 2-year-old grandson, then took his own life.
   ``He was the kind of person who didn't want to be burdened in his
own life and didn't want me to be burdened by my child,'' Ms. Day
said Thursday.
   The Lewis County sheriff's department found the bodies of
75-year-old Hollis Day and little Dylan on Wednesday night in Day's
locked Jeep Waggoner. Grandfather and grandson had been missing
since Tuesday morning.
   The bodies were found on wooded, family-owned land 50 miles from
the Day home. The gun lay near the bodies. Both had been shot in the
head.
   Ms. Day said she began worrying a few hours after finding a note
that read, ``Gramps and Dylan have gone bye-bye together.''
   ``He was having dreams, you know, of he and my son floating off
into the air and reliving all these things in the hereafter _ the
... hunting and skiing and fishing trips,'' the 40-year-old woman
recalled.
   Her father had greeted her with an extra warm hug when she woke
up Tuesday morning, and told her that she was a wonderful girl and
mother, Ms. Day said.
   She asked him to take care of Dylan while she packed up Christmas
gifts to head home for Portland, Ore., and then learned the two had
taken off together in Day's vehicle, Dylan hastily wrapped in a coat
and hat over his pajamas.
   Ms. Day, Dylan and the boy's father, Al Berreth, had been
visiting her parents.
   She found the note and, a few hours later, the tenor of its words
suddenly merged with what her father had been saying in recent
months, and it hit her: ``Bye-bye'' meant eternity.
   She called police, indicating a suicide was possible.
   ``At this point, the evidence appears consistent with a
homicide-suicide theory,'' Lewis County Sheriff Bill Logan said.
   Day, the retired president of a clothing company, had been
scheduled for cataract surgery Thursday, and he was ``very very
disturbed about my child's condition,'' she said.
   Dylan, her only child, suffered from a mild form of cerebral
palsy, and was considered developmentally disabled, Ms. Day said.
   ``When you have a handicapped child, they're a little bit more
work and he thought that having a child like that would be a total
altering of my lifestlye that he didn't want to see imposed upon a
daughter that he loved dearly. But it wasn't in my wildest dreams
that he'd do this.''
   But her son was `` doing just fine,'' in a hospital therapy
program, she said.
   ``He was beginning to walk and talk... He was a gregarious,
outgoing, happy, loving, affectionate child. He was a beautiful
child. ... He would have been walking eventually. ... He was not
retarded _ he was a slow learner.''
   With more sadness than anger, she said her father was probably
just trying to help, but had been losing his ability to think
rationally.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Museum of Fine Arts is returning to
Egypt some fragments of nine ancient paintings because curators have
concluded the art was stolen from a 15th century B.C. tomb.
   The museum bought the paintings from an art dealer in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands, in 1978 for an undisclosed sum and they are not
considered archaeologically significant, museum officials said
Thursday.
   The artifacts probably will be returned in the spring after a
representative of the Egyptian Antiquities Service comes to Boston
to supervise packing and shipping, said Museum Director Alan
Shestack.
   Shestack ordered research into the paintings last year, after the
museum's Egyptian art department expressed suspicions about the
legality of their origin.
   The museum decided to return the artifacts voluntarily because
they apparently were stolen, smuggled out of Egypt and sold into the
art world, museum officials said.
   The fragments came from the Theban tomb of Minnakht, an official
in the period of Thutmose III, and date to 1450-1420 B.C., said
Timothy Kendall, the museum's acting curator of Egyptian and ancient
Near Eastern art. The tomb is located in the Nobles Tombs at Luxor
in southern Egypt.
   Thutmose was considered the greatest pharaoh of the 18th dynasty,
known for conquests that extended Egypt to the banks of the
Euphrates River and the fourth cataract of the Nile River in what is
now the Sudan.
   The fragments depict men and women bearing offerings, but most of
the figures are only partly preserved, Kendall said. The largest
fragment is about 1 foot long and 10 inches high.
   The Amsterdam dealer who sold the objects to the museum has since
died, Shestack said.

<TEXT>
   A plan to close 34 of the nation's major
military facilities won the endorsement of key congressional leaders
and appears headed for success.
   In fact, Sen. Sam Nunn and Rep. Les Aspin, chairmen of the Senate
and House armed services committees, say they would like to see even
more obsolete bases closed.
   Nunn, D-Ga., and Aspin, D-Wis., pledged to work hard to ensure
that the plan is not blocked by lawmakers concerned over jobs lost
in their districts.
   But Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said 12,000 jobs in his district
would be threatened, and urged his colleagues to oppose the base
closing plan.
   ``If the Congress is about caring for human beings as we're
attempting to establish the national defense, clearly there'll be a
broader base of support than just those members whose districts are
affected,'' Lewis said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has until Jan. 15, five days
before he leaves office, to approve or reject the entire package of
recommendations, which were presented to the Pentagon on Thursday by
the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. There appeared
little doubt that Carlucci would back the proposal enthusiastically.
   Congress then has to buy or reject the whole package, and initial
comments suggested it would accept the commission's proposals
despite hometown appeals from areas which would lose bases.
   In all, the panel, led by former Republican congressman Jack
Edwards of Alabama and Abraham Ribicoff, a former Democratic senator
from Connecticut, called for closing 86 facilities, including 34
major installations and 52 military housing units. It also proposed
partially closing five bases and changing the role and manpower
levels at 54 others.
   The cuts would save an estimated $693 million annually and $5.6
billion over the next two decades. That's a small fraction of the
total Pentagon budget of about $300 billion a year, but the closings
could set a precedent.
   ``I think this ought to be a continuous source of study by the
new (defense) secretary,'' said Nunn.
   If Carlucci endorses the package, it will go to the White House
for the president's signature unless both houses of Congress pass
resolutions specifically rejecting it. Congress drafted the law
creating the complex procedure, which was designed to reduce
political pressure to keep the bases open.
   Carlucci was vacationing over the holidays and had no immediate
reaction to the recommendations, but spokesmen for the Army, Air
Force and Navy endorsed them.
   An Army spokesman, Maj. Dick Bridges, said he saw ``no
unwarranted closures on the list'' of bases. ``If we don't need
them, we should get rid of them.''
   Nunn and Aspin said their only objection was that the list was
too short.
   ``I would have liked to have see more,'' said Nunn. Aspin called
the list ``too modest'' and said it could have been up to about 30
percent longer. Neither specified which other bases could have been
included.
   The two states hardest hit by the closures would be California
and Illinois. California would lose George, Mather and Norton Air
Force bases, a future Navy base at Hunters Point in San Francisco,
and the Presidio, headquarters for the 6th Army, also in San
Francisco. Illinois would lose Chanute Air Force Base and Fort
Sheridan, an Army base.
   ``How can we justify closing military bases in our own back yard
when we don't even consider a single one of the 1,500 overseas U.S.
military facilities for the same treatment?'' said Sen. Alan Dixon,
D-Ill., chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on readiness.
   ``The overseas bases ought to be looked at first to make sure the
need is still there,'' echoed Sen. Paul Simon, another Illinois
Democrat.
   San Francicso Mayor Art Agnos said the commission's
recommendation to close the Presidio would have ``very grave
consequences'' for the city.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, said closing the
Presidio ``will have a significant effect on the economy.'' The base
is the third-largest employer in the city and has an annual payroll
of $600 million, she said.
   Although most objections to the report came from politicians
representing affected localities, there were hints of internal
wrangling in the Pentagon.
   One member of the commission said the Navy had ``stonewalled'' to
avoid the heavier cuts experienced by the Army and Air Force.
   The Navy lost six installations, three of which had not yet
entered service, compared with five major air bases lost by the Air
Force and the Army's 26 bases and 52 housing units that would be
partially or wholly closed.
   Thomas Eagleton, a former Democratic senator from Missouri who
joined the 12-member commission part way through its seven-month
review, said ``the Navy stonewalled, and got away with it.''
   ``The Air Force ultimately gave its cooperation. The Army
begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation,'' Eagleton said in an
``additional view'' at the close of the 88-page final report.
   For the Navy, he said, ``intransigence paid off. When the new
secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of
trimming the Pentagon budget, he should most certainly start with
the Navy. The Navy `refused to play' this time; it should be obliged
to next time.''
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley rejected Eagleton's
criticism.
   ``We feel we did cooperate with the commission and clearly
answered whatever questions the commission had,'' said Quigley.
   Navy officers argued that unlike the Air Force and the Army, they
eliminated many facilities employing thousands of people during the
1970s. Those facilities included the Quonset Point Naval Air Station
and Newport Naval Base in Rhode Island, the Boston Naval Shipyard,
the Glynco Naval Air Station in Georgia, the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard
in New York, and the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard near San Francisco.

   An Italian researcher will spend the first
five months of 1989 _ the time required to fly to Mars _ in a cave.
   Stefania Folini, 27, a member of a research team based in Ancona,
Italy, plans to descend Sunday into Lost Cave in southeast Carlsbad
in an experiment designed to simulate a space flight.
   ``What that does to you psychologically and physically is not
known,'' said Ron Kerbo, a cave specialist for nearby Carlsbad
Caverns National Park.
   Folini is a member of Pioneer Frontier Exploration and Research
Group of Ancona, said Jim Goodbar, cave specialist with the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management in Carlsbad.
   The Italian group will run the experiment with the help of NASA,
officials said. A team of four doctors, based in a mobile home at
the cave entrance, will monitor the woman using the computer,
microphones, a video camera and brain-wave sensors, Goodbar said.
   The cave's environment is constant, like that of a spaceship,
Goodbar said. The humidity always hovers just under 100 percent, and
the temperature remains at 69 degrees. The cave's central chamber is
about 150 feet by 30 feet, with a ceiling about 12 feet high.

   Between 350 and 450 people could die in traffic
accidents on the nation's highways during the three-day New Year's
holiday weekend, according to estimates by the National Safety
Council.
   The Chicago-based council said millions of Americans would drive
an estimated 11.5 billion miles during the three-day observance,
which for counting purposes extends from 6 p.m. local time Friday to
midnight Monday.
   In addition to the deaths, between 16,000 and 21,000 people may
suffer serious injuries as a result of traffic accidents during the
New Year's holiday period, the council said.
   About 330 people could be expected to die during a normal
three-day period at this time of the year, the council said.
   Last year, 375 people were killed during a four-day New Year's
observance. The worst New Year's toll recorded was 1965, when 564
people were killed during a three-day period.
   During the recent Christmas holiday weekend, at least 387 people
were killed in traffic accidents, the council said.

   Women for the first time outperformed men on a
fitness test required for entrance into the Denver police academy,
following court-ordered changes that placed greater emphasis on
flexibility than raw strength.
   Denver Civil Service Commission records showed 77 percent of the
female candidates passed the fitness exam between August and
October, compared o 66 percent of the men.
   The test was revised in May 1987 after 75 female recruits who
failed the old exam charged it put too much emphasis on upper-body
strength and did not reflect the physical demands of police work.
The new test implemented as part of an out-of-court settlement
stresses flexibility and endurance.
   Men and women also must meet different standards and are measured
against national averages for people of the same age and gender.
   The new tests were administered between August and October to 13
women and 113 men vying for 25 openings at the police academy.
   Two women will be among the 25 recruits to start at the academy
Jan. 15, said Ed Gietl, executive director of the commission.
   Under the old fitness test, women failed an average of 67 percent
of the time.
   In approving the settlement between the city and the 75 female
recruits in May 1987, U.S. District Judge Alfred Arraj ordered the
department to revise the test.
   The new exam, developed by the Cooper Institute in Dallas,
includes a 1{-mile run, a bench and leg press, sit-ups and other
exercises.

   A masked man jumped into a bank delivery van today
and drove it away, dragging a guard for 50 yards and fleeing with
more than $2.5 million in Japanese currency, police said.
   The heist outside the Taiyo Kobe Bank branch in the western
Japanese city of Suma was the second-biggest cash robbery in
Japanese history, officials said.
   The thief got into the van after it pulled up to the bank and the
crew prepared to make a delivery of cash, checks and promissory
notes, Hyogo Prefectural Police said.
   Police said the middle-aged man was familiar with the locks used
in the vehicle, and that a man of the same general build had
recently been seen loitering near the bank.
   ``The driver stepped out of the van for a second to close the
rear door ... and the man jumped in and started the engine,'' a
police official said.
   ``When the driver heard the sound of the engine, he rushed to the
driver's seat and grabbed the steering wheel, but the robber pushed
him back and drove away,'' the official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The driver, Shigetoshi Oe, 53, held on to the window of the
vehicle and was dragged for about 50 yards. Police said he was not
injured.
   The van, owned by Nippon Express Co., was found about two hours
later abandoned in a grassy parking lot less than a mile from the
bank with four empty cash boxes inside, the police official said.
   The van had carried 320 million yen, or about $2.54 million, and
about $1.4 million in checks and promissory notes, police said.
   It was the second-largest cash robbery in Japanese history,
police said.
   In 1986, a group of men wearing motorcycle helmets drove off in a
cash delivery truck containing 333 million yen, about $2.64 million
at current exchange rates.

   At least 11 soldiers and three
communist insurgents were killed in scattered clashes between two
holiday cease-fires, military reports said today.
   Reports released by military headquarters in Manila said six
soldiers were killed and six wounded when a band of rebels ambushed
an army patrol Thursday in Nueva Ecija province, 50 miles north of
Manila.
   On Samar island, 250 miles southeast of the capital, hundreds of
New People's Army guerrillas attacked a military detachment in the
town of Arteche early Thursday, killing at least five soldiers,
another report said.
   It said an undetermined number of civilian militiamen also were
killed in the fighting, which lasted two hours.
   The reports said that in both clashes, the rebels suffered
undetermined casualties.
   Three rebels were killed in Luzon island's southeastern Albay
province on Thursday, a report from military officials in the area
said. It gave no details.
   The latest fatalities brought to at least 31 the number of people
killed in fighting throughout the Philippines this week. Earlier
clashes, most allegedly initiated by the rebels, occurred on
Mindanao and Negros islands.
   President Corazon Aquino last week declared two 48-hour
cease-fires for Christmas and New Year's and the New People's Army
followed with a similar announcement. The New Year's cease-fire was
to go into effect at midnight.

   Gunfire killed two people and wounded 28
during demonstrations over steep price increases and demands for an
end to Sudan's civil war, a senior official said today.
   Demonstrators took to the streets for a fourth consecutive day
today, even though the government canceled the price increases
because of the protests, and a general strike continued to paralyze
much of the country.
   Khartoum Commissioner Fatih Abdoun reported the shooting
incident, saying ``an unidentified gunman'' caused the casualties
when he opened fire on protesters near Cabinet offices Thursday.
Abdoun gave no details.
   Other reports conflicted with his account but did not mention
casualties.
   ``The action in the streets is taking on a definite
anti-government flavor,'' said a Western diplomat who closely
follows Sudanese affairs from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital.
   ``It looks like the government is in serious trouble,'' he told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``There is a lot of
talk about a coup attempt coming out of Khartoum ... There is
complete political chaos.''
   A crisis caused by an air traffic controllers' strike appeared to
have ended today. An air traffic controller in Cairo, Egypt, said
Khartoum International Airport, closed since Wednesday night as part
of the general strike, was reopened around 11 a.m.
   Two news dispatches received in Cairo on Thursday reported
shooting near the Cabinet offices. The timing of the reports
indicated there were two separate shootings. Neither mentioned
casualties.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency, in an early afternoon dispatch,
quoted the official Sudan News Agency as saying Sudanese police
opened fire on demonstrators when they refused to disperse after
being told that an emergency Cabinet session had rolled back the
price increases.
   Reports said demonstrators also were chanting slogans calling for
government action to implement a tentative peace plan.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency said in a
Khartoum-datelined report Thursday night that shooting occurred
shortly after dark in the Sudanese capital, ``especially near the
headquarters of the Council of Ministers.''
   Commissioner Abdoun's version of the shooting conflicted with the
Sudanese agency's report on the source of gunfire, and it was
impossible to tell whether he and the Iraqi news agency referred to
the same incident.
   Another version came from the British Foreign Office in London,
which based its reports on the Sudanese Ministry of Information.
   It said one person was reported injured Thursday in ``generally
peaceful'' large-scale demonstrations in Khartoum, some at the
university. Sudanese police used tear gas and ``warning shots'' to
disperse the protesters, it said.
   Strikes and demonstrations were prompted by a government decree
on Monday increasing sugar prices by 500 percent and cigarettes by
50 percent, and imposing a 15 percent sales tax on all commodities.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet met in emergency session
Thursday morning and revoked the price increases.
   The Cabinet also considered the Democratic Unionist Party's
withdrawal from the governing coalition Wednesday night. The
Unionists held the second-largest number of ministerial and
parliamentary seats after Mahdi's Umma Party.
   The party quit the government to protest the price increases and
Mahdi's failure to act on a tentative peace accord that a Unionist
leader negotiated last month with rebel leader John Garang in Addis
Ababa.
   Mahdi did not submit the accord to the Cabinet or the Constituent
Assembly, Sudan's parliament, for endorsement because he feared that
would prompt the fundamentalist National Islamic Front to leave his
coalition.
   The front, led by Mahdi's brother-in-law, Attorney General Hassan
Turabi, opposed the peace accord's stipulation that Sharia, Islam's
legal and ethical code, be suspended during peace talks and that
alternatives be considered.
   The mainly Christian and animist southern rebels demand
revocation of Sharia, imposed in 1983 by President Gaafar Nimeiri 18
months before he was overthrown in a 1985 military coup.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
Prime Minister Rajiv Ganhdi of India held their second private
meeting today as they sought to end four decades of friction between
their countries.
   Sources said the meetings, which have overshadowed a summit
involving seven south Asian nations, have been amicable and
productive.
   ``They're getting along famously,'' an Indian source said.
``Their meetings are going well,'' said another Indian official.
Both demanded anonymity.
   The leaders met following a regular summit session with the
leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
   The fourth annual summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation comes only four weeks after Ms. Bhutto took
office following Pakistan's first free election in 11 years. The
summit has kindled hopes of closer ties between India and Pakistan,
historically antagonistic nations.
   Gandhi spoke warmly of Ms. Bhutto in his speech at the opening
session Thursday night.
   ``I am particularly happy to be here when the people of Pakistan
have elected you, Madam Prime Minister, to lead your great country
forward to peace and prosperity, rooted in democracy. ... We rejoice
in the prospect of friendship and cooperation between India and
Pakistan,'' Gandhi said.
   After the 2{-hour opening session, Gandhi and his wife, Sonia,
met privately over dinner with Ms. Bhutto and her husband,
businessman Asif Zardari.
   Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto's session this afternoon was to last up to
two hours _ much longer than those she scheduled with other visiting
leaders. Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto are to meet again Saturday after the
summit ends.
   Although Ms. Bhutto did not refer to Gandhi in her inaugural
speech, she said last week that continued animosity between India
and Pakistan did not serve the interest of their peoples.
   The two countries have fought three wars since they were
partitioned in 1947 upon the demise of British colonial India.
   Relations have further been strained by a border dispute over
Kashmir, which was split between Pakistan and India when the
subcontinent was divided. India claims part of the territory in
Pakistan.
   Protesters have demonstrated daily in Islamabad against India's
claim. Sardar Qayyum Khan, president of the Pakistan-controlled part
of Kashmir, said the protests ``have mobilized Kashmiris on this
side of the cease-fire line and have shown our integrity and
solidarity with those suffering on the other side.''
   Other areas of friction between the nations include fears of each
other's nuclear capabilities and claims that Pakistan has supported
Sikh separatists who have killed 2,400 people this year in India's
border state of Punjab. Pakistan has denied the charges.
   So far, Pakistani and Indian officials have declined to comment
on the prospects of Ms. Bhutto visiting India soon. She has said her
first foreign trips will be to China and Saudi Arabia. She is
expected to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, site of Islam's holiest
shrine, in January, but no date has been set for a trip to Beijing.
   Today's summit session was at Daman-e-Koh, a white-domed retreat
on a hillside overlooking Islamabad.
   Police with rifles stood at intervals of 20 feet to 150 feet.
Other uniformed and plainclothes guards stood in clusters, on rocky
outcrops and among the trees and thickets.
   The security was a reminder of the region's potential for
violence.
   Both Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Junius R. Jayewardene have
escaped unhurt from assassination attempts in their capitals, while
Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was the target of an
unsuccessful coup less than two months ago.
   Another participant, former Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad of
Bangladesh, assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1982, although a
yes-or-no referendum subsequently proclaimed him president. The
other summit participants, King Birendra of Nepal and King Jigme
Singhe Wangchuk of Bhutan, rule through hereditary succession.
   Ms. Bhutto's avenue to power through popular election followed
the death of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who in 1977 overthrew
her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto was
subsequently convicted in a murder case and executed. Zia, U.S.
Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel and 35 others were killed Aug. 17 in an
explosion that destroyed their aircraft over Pakistan. Officials
blamed sabotage but could not say who was responsible for downing
the plane.

<HEAD>China Calls for Direct Talks with Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Chinese official today marked the 10th
anniversary of a Chinese appeal for peaceful reunification with
Taiwan by renewing China's proposal for direct talks with Taiwan's
Nationalist government.
   ``We hold that the Communist Party and the Kumomintang
(Nationalists) should establish contacts and start negotiations at
an early date on the basis of equality,'' Vice Premier Wu Xueqian
said. ``We can talk about the reunification of the country, or carry
out consultations on the concrete issues concerning the relations
between the two sides.''
   Wu was speaking at a forum of 300 senior party and government
leaders held to commemorate China's ``message to Taiwan
compatriots'' issued on Jan. 1, 1979.
   The message called for the peaceful reunification of Taiwan with
the mainland and proposed direct transportation and postal links as
a first step toward easing tensions between the two nations.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, in a report on the forum, said
the 1979 message signified a historic turning point in relations
between the mainland and Taiwan.
   China has since then called for direct political and trade
contacts and has said Taiwan can keep its current political and
economic system if it rejoins the mainland.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan after their defeat to the
communists in 1949, have rejected all proposals for direct contacts
with the mainland. However, in the past year the Taiwan government
has eased travel and trade restrictions with the mainland.
   More than 400,000 Taiwan residents have traveled to the mainland
in the past year, and indirect trade is estimated at $2.4 billion in
1988, up from $1.5 billion in 1987.
   ``Such changes are in accordance with people's wishes and the
overall tendency of this historic development is therefore
irreversible,'' Wu said.
   He also expressed concern about Taiwanese advocates of
independence and those on the island who are in favor of ``two
Chinas'' or ``dual recognition'' concepts.
   Reunification is in the interests of both sides, he said. ``This
will not only help the whole country to quickly become prosperous,
but will also help maintain sustained development on the island,
which can then enjoy the prestige of the great motherland.''

   Three-year-old Jason Pendleton hesitated
only briefly when his mother awoke him and asked for help that may
have saved her life.
   Liz Pendleton, 29, said Thursday she began feeling sick Tuesday
afternoon and woke up early Wednesday morning in severe pain and
paralyzed, hemorrhaging from a ruptured fallopian tube.
   She called to Jason, who was sleeping on the couch, and in a
barely audible whisper urged him to telephone for help. At first
Jason stood in disbelief, and assured her she could go to the doctor
the next day.
   After convincing her son that she couldn't wait, Mrs. Pendleton
made a zero out of her thumb and index finger and the youngster
followed her instructions to dial the number, she said.
   ``I told the operator, I told her that my mommy was sick and that
she wanted daddy to come home,'' Jason recalled.
   When the operator asked where Randy Pendleton worked, the
pre-schooler said he replied: ``Arkla Gas. In the 'puter room.''
   The operator, who the Pendletons still are hoping to identify,
telephoned Arkla and notified Pendleton, who summoned an ambulance
to their home.
   Mrs. Pendleton said Jason handled the telephone conversation like
a pro.
   ``He never got nervous,'' she said. ``He was just as calm as
though I asked him to do it all the time.''
   There was every reason to panic. Doctors said Mrs. Pendleton had
lost three pints of blood and was close to death.
   ``If I'd have laid there much longer, I'd have been gone,'' said
Mrs. Pendleton, who is expected to return home from Schumpert
Medical Center in three days.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, in another
step designed to reduce the chance of air sabotage, soon will
propose a computerized security system to tighten control over
access to planes, the agency's director said today.
   FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor said the agency has drafted a
proposed rule that would require workers to carry a computer-coded
card that would be coded to allow only authorized employees near
aircraft during maintenance and servicing.
   He was not specific as to when the proposal would be released.
   In addition, McArtor said an FAA directive issued Thursday
governing U.S. airline flights from the Middle East and Eastern
Europe called for ``very dramatic restrictions'' on access to
baggage once it is inspected.
   ``Not only the passenger will not have access, nobody will,''
McArtor said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   The directive issued Thursday will require U.S. airlines to look
inside every checked bag, by eye or X-ray, at airports in the Middle
East and Western Europe. Passengers should expect longer check-ins,
McArtor said.
   The stepped-up security comes in the wake of the bombing of the
New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, killing 270 people.
   The carriers also will have to make random visual inspections of
a percentage of hand baggage, with the bag being emptied and the
empty bag X-rayed, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told a news
conference Thursday.
   McArtor said he was ``not at liberty'' to say what percentage of
hand luggage would be inspected or how it would be selected.
   McArtor told reporters the stricter security measures ``are based
on the practices of El Al _ the best in the world,'' and ``far
exceed existing international standards.''
   El Al, the Israeli airline, has never had a bombing aboard one of
its aircraft. McArtor did not mention some El Al practices, such as
the testing of baggage in a decompression chamber and the close
questioning of passengers about their personal lives.
   In 1986, an El Al guard questioning a passenger, the unsuspecting
girlfriend of a terrorist, found a bomb in hand luggage at London's
Heathrow Airport.
   McArtor said the new rules would take effect in 48 hours. Much of
the new routine already is in place but isn't required to be
followed all the time, he said.
   ``The balance between security precautions and passenger
processing has been basically upset,'' McArtor said.
   Asked why similar new measures weren't being required in the
United States, he replied, ``The threat appears to be more
international in scope. We are encouraging our carriers to be more
vigilant domestically.''
   At the 103 airports affected in the Middle East and Western
Europe, the new precautions ``may well result in passenger delays
and inconvenience,'' such as ``check-in earlier, perhaps as much as
an hour.''
   President-elect Bush, vacationing in Texas on Thursday,
threatened retaliation against the bombers of the Pan Am jetliner.
   Bush said he would ``seek hard and punish firmly, decisively,
those who did this _ if you can ever find them.''
   But the vice president refused to discuss specifics of
retaliation, and he said it was unlikely terrorism could ever be
stopped completely.
   ``It is almost impossible to guarantee there will never be
another terrorism act,'' he said, though he suggested improved
intelligence and cooperation between nations.
   Here are the other principal provisions of the new FAA
requirement:
   _Parcels shipped through passenger ticket counters also must be
X-rayed or physically examined.
   _Passengers may not have access to checked baggage, and
additional measures will be required to keep other people from
unauthorized access. McArtor did not say what they would be.
   _Airlines must make a ``positive match'' of checked baggage to
actual passengers, keeping unaccompanied bags off the plane. If a
passenger leaves at an intermediate stop, said Ray Salazar, director
of the FAA's office of civil aviation, the passenger's baggage would
have to be taken off in accordance with the already required
``reconciliation at the transfer gate'' of the passenger and baggage
manifests.
   _The FAA is accelerating by six months the delivery of thermal
neutron analysis devices which are capable of detecting all known
explosives, even those that are transparent to X-rays such as the
plastic explosives favored by terrorists. Under the accelerated
program, the first unit will be in operation next summer and the
last of five, perhaps six, will be operational by the beginning of
1990.
   McArtor said it had not been decided where to place the thermal
neutron equipment.
   _The agency's security inspection staff will be increased by 35
percent, from 550 people to 670, over the next 20 months.
   JoAnn Sloane, an FAA spokeswoman, said the agency believed
training of airline security employees was adequate. She said the
agency had no estimate of what its new requirements would cost the
airlines.
   Stephen Hayes, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an
organization of the major U.S. air carriers, said the airline
industry will comply fully with the new security initiatives.
   ``However, more must be done than simply placing additional
security requirements on the airlines,'' Hayes said. ``The
government itself must become more directly involved in meeting the
threat that international terrorism presents.
   ``We believe the FAA should assign more of its security personnel
to Europe and the Middle East. And we believe the FAA should impose
the same security requirements on foreign airlines which serve the
United States as it imposes on U.S. airlines,'' he said.

   Here are some facts about Yugoslavia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Yugoslavia covers 98,766 square miles, slightly larger
than Wyoming. It a federation of six republics: Serbia, including
the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo; Croatia, Slovenia,
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro. The capital is
Belgrade.
   Yugoslavia occupies the western part of the Balkan peninsula,
with a long coast on the Adriatic Sea. About half the country is
mountainous. A rich plain in the north and northeast, drained by the
Danube, is the most fertile area.
   Yugoslavia is bordered by Austria, Italy and Hungary in the
north, Romania and Bulgaria in the east, and Greece and Albania in
the south.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Yugoslavia's population of just over 23 million
includes about 30 different nationalities. Serbs account for about
36 percent and the Croats for about 20 percent of the popoluation.
Other Slav groups are the Slovenes, 8 percent; and the Montenegrins,
3 percent. Ethnic Albanians, who live mostly in the tense province
of Kosovo, make up 9 percent of the population. An ethnic category
known as Moslems accounts for another 9 percent. Yugoslavia's ethnic
diversity has been a source of strife for centuries.
   The official languages are Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, and
Macedonian. An estimated 41 percent of Yugoslavs are Orthodox, 32
percent Roman Catholics and 12 percent are Muslims.

   THE ECONOMY: After President Josip Broz Tito's death in 1980, the
economy has deteriorated sharply, revealing the shortcomings of the
``self-management'' system officially giving workers the say in
running enterprises. In practice, Communist-dominated state planning
and widespread corruption have caused serious problems. Yugoslavia
now has a $21 billion foreign debt, 250 percent inflation and 15
percent unemployment. Mounting worker discontent has led to more
than 1,000 strikes in 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY: For about five centuries, much of the land that is
modern Yugoslavia was under Ottoman rule, shaken off in 19th century
uprisings. In December 1918, a Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes, including Bosnia Hercegovina, was formed. During World War
II, the Nazi invaders were fought both by royalists and Communist
partisans under Tito, who then became Yugoslavia's undisputed
postwar leader. Tito broke with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in
1948, and Yugoslavia became a nonaligned communist country. Some of
its present problems are attributed to the system bequeathed by
Tito, including annual rotation of key offices and a weak federal
authority. The state-run press and Yugoslavs themselves have become
increasingly outspoken and liberal as the mounting social and
economic problems have dented the authority of the Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   Premier Branko Mikulic and his entire
Cabinet quit today in the first resignation by a federal government
since the Communist Party took power after World War II.
   Mikulic told Parliament he stepped down because it refused on
Wednesday to pass an economic law needed to ensure continued support
from the International Monetary Fund for the debt-ridden country.
   The resignation could signal further liberalization of
Yugoslavia's one-party system as the ethnically divided country
struggles to solve unprecedented social and economic woes.
   Mikulic represented a hard-line faction within the party and his
resignation indicated that more reform-oriented forces are gaining
the upper hand in the party leadership.
   But the resignations also represent an attempt to shift blame for
the crisis away from the Communist Party to the premier and his
31-member Cabinet.
   Parliament and the nine-member federal presidency now will likely
consult on who will form a new government.
   In his speech, broadcast live on Belgrade television, Mikulic
refused to accept blame for the country's economic problems,
including a $21 billion foreign debt, 15 percent unemployment and
annual inflation of 250 percent.
   After the 35-minute speech, Parliament refused to take up an
option to discuss the resignation, in effect accepting it.
   Mikulic said Yugoslavia's economic problems were inherited ``from
past decades'' and that it was unrealistic for his government ``to
resolve them in only two and half years.''
   Mikulic began a four-year term after succeeding Milka Planinc as
premier in May 1986. ``It is more honorable for the government to
resign than to be blamed for all of the country's ills,'' Mikulic
said.
   In recent days, leading politicians criticized the government's
economic policies and state-run dailies had called for Mikulic's
immediate replacement.
   ``Poisonous arrows are being aimed at the government,'' Mikulic
said.
   He said the Cabinet decided to resign after Parliament on
Wednesday refused to pass a law that would have imposed curbs on
public spending. Mikulic said the law was needed to ensure continued
support from the International Monetary Fund.
   He told Parliament on Wednesday that agency insisted on austerity
measures limiting public spending before agreeing in June to grant
Yugoslavia a one-year standby credit of $416 million. About $260
million of that credit has been used, according to official
estimates.
   The loan was crucial to help Yugoslavia meet payments on its
foreign debt and reach separate agreements for loan rescheduling
with other Western banks and governments.
   The Communist Party daily Borba on Thursday quoted an
unidentified Cabinet minister as saying Parliament's refusal to pass
the law ``destroys the standby arrangement with the IMF...''
   In a bid to overcome the deteriorating situation, Parliament
adopted a new law Thursday to stimulate private enterprise,
liberalizing rules for establishing private businesses. The law was
adopted ``for the first step toward market economy,'' the state news
agency said.
   Yugoslavia has had a record number of strikes this year, with
workers protesting low wages and declining living standards.
   Mikulic survived a potential vote of confidence in May, when
deputies from the liberal northern republic of Slovenia and from
Croatia failed to gather support from the other four Yugoslav
republics to vote out the government.
   Mikulic's reputation has been tarnished further by a corruption
scandal involving hundreds of officials in his native republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
   Yugoslavia also has been wracked by unrest among its various
ethnic groups.
   Mikulic is an economist who served as a presiding member of the
Yugoslav Communist Party in 1978 and 1979 under the late leader
Josip Broz Tito.
   Although he rejected blame for Yugoslavia's economic problems,
observers said his decision to step down was at least partly
intended to placate Yugoslavia's 23 million citizens, who are
increasingly angered by falling living standards.
   Although Mikulic has been accused of incompetence, Yugoslavia's
complex federal system also has hindered a solution to its economic
problems.
   The need for unanimity by the country's six constituent republics
and two autonomous provinces on all federal matters means that key
decisions are often watered down to ineffective compromises.

   A caller claiming to represent the Guardians of the
Islamic Revolution, which last week said it blew up Pan Am Flight
103, telephoned American news agencies today and threatened more
action.
   The anonymous male caller repeated the claim of responsibility
and said that unless the United States deports Reza Pahlavi, son of
the late Shah of Iran, ``there will be another present in the New
Year for America.''
   Speaking in a Middle Eastern accent, he read a brief statement to
The Associated Press in broken English and hung up, refusing to
answer questions.
   ``In the name of the God and Islamic revolution and Imam
Khomeini, we are very pleased to succeed the Pan Am attack,'' he
said.
   ``We are very concerned with the recent activities of the Reza
Pahlavi in Europe and America. We demand America to throw him out of
America or else there will be another present in the New Year for
America.''
   United Press International said it received a similar call.
   An anonymous male caller telephoned the AP on Dec. 22, the day
after the jumbo jet crashed in southern Scotland, killing all 259
people aboard and leaving 11 missing and presumed dead on the
ground. British officials later concluded that a bomb downed the
plane.
   He said it was in retaliation for the shooting down of an Iran
Air Airbus by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in July. The Navy said
the plane was mistaken for an Iranian fighter. All 290 people aboard
were killed.
   U.S. officials and terrorism experts said it was unlikely that
the group actually was responsible for the Pan Am bomb.
   The group previously claimed responsibility for a July 1987 car
bombing in London that wounded Amir Hussein Amir-Parviz, the
chairman of the National Movement for Iranian resistance and a
former Iranian Cabinet minister under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
who was ousted in the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   The shah was denied permanent sanctuary in the United States and,
suffering from cancer, shuttled with his family from Morocco to
Mexico, Panama and the Bahamas before being granted asylum in Egypt,
where he died.
   The family moved to the United States in 1984. His son Reza
Pahlavi, whom exiled supporters now call the Shah, lives at an
estate in Virginia, just outside Washington, with his wife, Yasmine.
   The late shah's wife, Farah, and their other children, Farahnaz,
Ali Reza, and Leila, also live in the United States.

   Six current or former police officers were among 18
people indicted in a towing scam that allegedly bilked at least 600
people from 1982 to 1987, authorities said.
   Police Sgt. William H. Kelley Jr., 51, chief of the department's
auto theft unit, was charged with six counts of conspiracy, perjury
and writing a false police report, according to indictments returned
Thursday by a Suffolk County grand jury.
   The suspects allegedly participated in several schemes to tow
legally and illegally parked cars and overcharge owners when they
came to retrieve them, said David Rodman, a spokesman for District
Attorney Newman Flanagan.
   The grand jury handed up 1,500 charges in the indictments, which
capped a two-year investigation.
   Police Commissioner Francis X. Roache vowed to continue probing
police corruption.
   ``The public should be outraged that a group of people conspired
to literally take 600 to 800 cars off the street with no authority,
in total violation of the rules and regulations,'' he said. ``I
think it's time to look at the whole towing industry.''
   Also indicted were three other police officers, one Metropolitan
District Commission police officer, one former police captain, two
employees of the city's abandoned car division, two former
inspectors at the state Registry of Motor Vehicles, a special agent
with the National Auto Theft Bureau and the owners of two city
garages.
   The defendants face charges including larceny, concealing stolen
motor vehicles, perjury, conspiracy and insurance fraud.
   Kelley and Officer William R. Cantin, 40, who was indicted on 535
charges, have been suspended without pay, police spokesman Jim
Jordan said.
   Two other indicted officers, Peter Doherty, 47, and John Ulrich,
44, were placed on administrative leave pending a departmental
hearing, Jordan said.
   Rodman said one alleged scheme profited from the different
charges levied on cars towed by police and those towed by the
Registry of Motor Vehicles, which charges more to drivers to
retrieve cars. He said police would tow a car that was parked
illegally but the defendants would tell the owner the car had been
towed by the registry ``and pick up the extra money.''
   Another scheme, Rodman said, would be to tow a legally parked
car, and wait several weeks after the owner reported it stolen to
collect daily storage charges _ often up to $600.
   The indictment does not say how much money was lost.

   A self-styled revolutionary admitted in federal
court to taking part in bombings and bank robberies as part of a
campaign to overthrow the government.
   Carol Ann Saucier Manning, 32, admitted Thursday to three of the
charges she faces with four remaining defendants in the U.S.
District Court trial that is scheduled to start Jan. 9.
   ``I want this over with. The evidence that convicted me in
Brooklyn will convict me here,'' Manning said at a two-hour hearing
in the Boston court. ``I do not want to go through this again. I
want to know what's ahead for me.''
   Manning, already serving 15 years in her 1986 New York City
conviction on bombing charges, said she plans to seek her high
school equivalency diploma and learn a skill in prison. She faces
another 60 years in prison and $60,000 in fines on the latest
charges.
   Manning pleaded guilty to racketeering, conspiring to racketeer
and seditious conspiracy, but was allowed to invoke the Alford
Doctrine, in which the defendant does not admit guilt but enters the
plea to take advantage of a plea-bargain offer.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks fought Manning's petition,
saying there was no plea agreement and such a plea was not in the
public interest, since it ``eliminates a potential avenue for
discovering now-decaying and extremely usable dynamite'' that the
group is alleged to have used.
   He argued that only some of 1,166 sticks of dynamite have been
recovered. ``This would leave about 390 sticks of dynamite and water
gel explosives and 84 blasting caps, at a minimum, unaccounted for.''
   U.S. District Judge William G. Young allowed the change in plea
after ensuring that Manning knew which rights she was forfeiting.
   The three-count indictment charged her and the other four
remaining defendants with engaging in a conspiracy to rob banks and
bomb military offices, defense contractors and other institutions
from 1976 to 1985. A Boston courthouse worker lost a leg and 21
other people were injured in one 1976 bombing.
   All but one of the defendants are serving jail sentences for
previous convictions on other charges related to the bombings and
robberies.

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese magazine today reported that
Britain and Iran were negotiating secretly for the release of
British hostages believed held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
   But a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said on condition
of anonymity that the report in the weekly Ash-Shiraa was ``absolute
nonsense.''
   The magazine, citing an unidentified ``well-informed source in
Moslem west Beirut,'' said the talks were ``expected to result in
the release of the British hostages soon.''
   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story
two years ago of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for
American hostages. But its recent reports on the foreign captives in
Lebanon have not been accurate.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man
with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought
by the Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a New
York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they
killed him. His body was never found.
   The 15 foreigners believed held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
factions include nine Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Iranian authorities recently allowed Britain's charge d'affaires
in Tehran to visit jailed Briton Roger Cooper.
   Cooper, a 52-year-old businessmen accused by Iran of spying, has
been held in Tehran without trial for more than three years.
   The visit Wednesday was the first consular access Iranian
authorities have allowed to Cooper since August and came two days
after the release from jail in Tehran of another Briton, 23-year-old
Nicholas Nicola.

   A group of 23 Polish sailors has asked for
political asylum after fleeing the same two vessels that brought 13
other Polish sailors who landed here in January with the same
request.
   The latest group of sailors set foot here Tuesday after
disembarking from the fishing trawlers Kunatka and Laskara. On
Thursday they began the formal process of applying for asylum.
   Some of the men carried shore passes as they entered the
Polish-American Citizens Club in the city's Dorchester section. They
told patrons and staff that they wanted to remain in the United
States.
   City Hall officials and representatives of Polish-American groups
met with the seamen to discuss the process.
   City immigration consultant Kathryn MacInnes interviewed them and
prepared their asylum applications. ``They have to show they have
well-founded fears of persecution if they were to return to their
country,'' she said.
   Most of the men are married, and many have children. Hopeful that
asylum will be granted soon, the men say they are also hopeful that
they can be reunited with their families.
   The Polish sailors who jumped ship in January were granted asylum
in April under a process the federal government considers expedited,
Ms. MacInnes said.
   The Kunatka has left Boston. The Laskara is docked in Boston for
repairs.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Schlesinger, who has served in the
Cabinet under three presidents, is among nearly a dozen people
rumored to be in contention for the post of energy secretary in the
Bush administration.
   Schlesinger would fit the president-elect's desire for someone
with a nuclear background to tackle the department's massive cleanup
and modernization at its 17 weapons plants in 12 states.
   At least 10 other names still were circulating around
Washington's rumor mills Thursday.
   Schlesinger's was a new name as a possible selection, and Bush
transition office sources identified him as a top contender. Two
other candidates, Lee M. Thomas, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, and former congressman Henson Moore of Louisiana,
also remained in leading contention.
   Now a consultant and staff member of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, Schlesinger served as Defense Secretary under
President Nixon and was dismissed from that job President Ford in
1975. His resignation was one of a handful President Carter accepted
in 1979 after demanding resignations from the entire Cabinet and top
echelons of his administration.
   Schlesinger, who was traveling Thursday, was let go by Ford
because of budget differences and, according to one account, because
he presumed to lecture the president, a congressional veteran, on
how to deal with a House committee chairman Ford had known for
decades.
   Schlesinger had the misfortune to be energy secretary when the
Iranian revolution triggered gasoline lines in much of the United
States _ lines many analysts, including the current secretary, John
Herrington, believe were the result of price and allocation controls
in effect at the time and no longer on the books.
   An economist, Schlesinger has strongly supported nuclear power.
When he was a member of the old Atomic Energy Commission, he took
his family to witness a nuclear weapons test in Alaska to show his
confidence in the safety arrangements.
   Moore, who represented a chemicals and refining-intensive
district around Baton Rouge, La., is a lawyer whose unsuccessful
campaign for the Senate in 1986 was hobbled by the collapse of crude
oil prices. He has campaigned for the secretary's job. His selection
would be taken as a sign of Bush's concern for the domestic oil
industry, which lost 150,000 jobs in the price collapse.
   Thomas has no particular nuclear background, but got his start at
EPA reviving the nearly abortive ``superfund'' toxic waste cleanup
program in 1983, and presided over a quintupling of the program then
and as administrator after 1985.
   Bush's nuclear concern brought two Democratic names to the
surface: John Deutch, undersecretary in Schlesinger's days at the
Energy Department and now provost of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and John Ahearne, former chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and now chairman of Herrington's Advisory
Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety.
   Other names mentioned are:
   _Martha Hesse, deregulation-oriented chairman of the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, and former assistant energy secretary
for administration.
   _Peter Johnson, former head of the Bonneville Power
Administration and the candidate backed by Sen. James McClure of
Idaho, senior Republican on the Energy Committee.
   _Retiring Sen. Dan Evans of Washington, who has been opposed by
McClure.
   _Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
   _Air Force Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, retiring head of the
Pentagon's Star Wars space-defense program and former head of both
the F-16 fighter and the space shuttle programs.
   _Former Rep. James Broyhill of North Carolina, senior Republican
on the House Energy and Commerce Committee before losing a Senate
race in 1986.

   Israeli troops shot and killed three
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip over the last two days, the
army said today.
   An army spokesman also said 1,194 Palestinian schools in the West
Bank will be shut for a week because of increased student violence.
   Two of the deaths in Gaza took place Thursday night in the Gaza
City neighborhood of Zeitoun, the spokesman said. He said the two
Palestinians were shot when they tried to escape after being ordered
out of their house. The two were suspected of throwing firebombs, he
said.
   ``They were ordered to come out,'' the spokesman said. ``Then
they tried to escape and were shot.'' He said one suspect died at
the scene, another died in an Israeli hospital and a third was
captured unharmed.
   The violence continued today with one Palestinian killed and nine
wounded in Gaza as army-imposed curfews confined at least 160,000
Palestinians to their homes in refugee camps and towns.
   An Arab reporter said the army broke up a protest that followed
noon Moslem prayers in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhhod of Gaza City.
He said soldiers used clubs, rubber bullets and live ammunition.
   Abdel Khalim Behid, 22, was shot in the lung during the
disturbance and died at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, hospital
officials said. Five Arabs were wounded by gunshots, and a
4-year-old boy was hit in the head with a rubber bullet. The army
confirmed Behid was killed by army gunfire, and that four
Palestinians were wounded in the Sheikh Radwan clash.
   ``After prayers, they raised the Palestinian flag and threw
stones,'' the army spokesman said. He said troops opened fire to
disperse the crowd.
   Elsewhere in Gaza City, three Palestinians were wounded, among
them a 35-year-old woman hit in the abdomen, Arab doctors said. In
the Jabalya refugee camp, a teenager was wounded.
   The deaths raised to at least 342 the number of Palestinians
killed in the year-old rebellion against the 21-year occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Fourteen Israelis have also been
killed.
   In the West Bank, Israel's military administration announced a
weeklong closure of all Palestinian schools because of ``numerous
incidents of disturbances by students,'' a spokesman said.
   The measure, which takes effect Saturday, prevents about 300,000
Palestinian school students from attending classes.
   Schools in the West Bank were closed by the army Feb. 3 for
nearly 10 months. Authorities gradually reopened the 1,194 West Bank
schools in December but made studies conditional on a halt to
student violence.
   Army officials say schools often become focal points for violent
demonstrations in the uprising. For that reason, four universities
and 16 junior colleges in the West Bank have been shut indefinitely.
   Palestinians have protested the closure, with educators arguing
that students were losing the discipline for study.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Official To Lose Car Rental Franchise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car rental company said today
it will take a franchise away from a member of a right-wing town
council that has reinstated hard-line segregation laws.
   Louis de Waal, executive director of the South Africa's Budget
Rent-a-Car, said in a statement that his company would sever its
ties in February with Billy Olivier, operator of a Budget franchise
in Brakpan.
   Olivier is a member of the far-right Conservative Party, which
won control of councils in Brakpan and dozens of other towns in
municipal elections on Oct. 26.
   The councils in Brakpan and Boksburg, both industrial towns on
the eastern edge of the greater Johannesburg region, have reinstated
``whites only'' status at parks and other public facilities that had
been opened to all races in recent years.
   The actions have been widely condemned, not only by
anti-apartheid groups but also by the government. However, the
governing National Party has given no indication it will repeal the
Separate Amenities Act, which allows racial segregation of local
facilities.
   ``We do not believe that Mr. Olivier's views and those of his
Conservative Party colleagues represent the outlook of the silent
majority of Brakpan voters,'' said de Waal.
   ``While the separate amenities legislation that is being enforced
was put in place by the government, it appears these measures were
dying an evolutionary death until the stance taken by the
Conservative Party.''
   In another development, the Rev. Allan Hendrickse, a politician
who has irked the government with his defiant tactics, says he has
accepted an invitation to attend the inauguration of President-elect
George Bush.
   Hendrickse told the annual congress of his Labor Party on
Thursday that he would attend the inauguration during a three-week
trip to the United States. He will miss the opening of South
Africa's 1989 parliamentary session on Feb. 3.
   The Labor Party controls the mixed-race chamber of Parliament,
which also has chambers for whites and for Asians but excludes the
black majority.
   Anti-apartheid activists criticized the Labor Party for deciding
to join the newly expanded Parliament in 1984, but in the past 18
months Hendrickse has taken an increasingly confrontational stance
toward the government.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Germany Seeks To Avoid Trade War Over Hormone-Treated U.S. Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
appealed to the EEC and the United States today to avoid an all-out
trade war in a dispute over hormone-treated meat.
   But the European Economic Community should not reconsider its
refusal to accept U.S. meat products containing growth hormones,
Genscher said in an interview with Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio.
   He said the ban ``is not any form of discrimination because the
same rules apply to all of us, and the decision is based on health
policies.''
   American officials are threatening to impose $100 million worth
of trade sanctions on European food products starting Sunday because
of the EEC's refusal to accept American meat containing growth
hormones.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Tuesday that
the sanctions, which would effectively double the price of European
food imports, would go into effect unless the meat restrictions are
lifted.
   The use of growth hormones on livestock is prohibited in the EEC,
although a number of scandals involving illegal hormones have rocked
the meat industries of West Germany and other European nations in
recent months.
   Genscher urged that no countermeasures be undertaken by the EEC
if the U.S. sanctions are imposed. He said the two sides should try
to resolve their disagreement through the framework of the
international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT.
   Genscher said the EEC should try to defuse the dispute in talks
with the American government at the same time.
   European and some American consumer groups say the hormones,
which U.S. producers use to make cattle grow faster, are hazardous
to human health. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the
quantities are miniscule compared with the amounts of the same
hormones produced by the human body.
   The FDA approves only three kinds of hormone treatment _
estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. It banned diethyl
stilbestrol, or DES, 10 years ago after it was proven to be
cancer-causing.
   Use of DES by European cattle growers led to a scare for Italian
consumers in 1980, when hundreds of children showed signs of early
sexual development such as breast growth.
   Residues of DES were also discovered in residents of West Germany
and Holland, prompting a consumer movement that led to European-wide
legislation against hormone-treated meat.

   A plaque marking the apartment house where Leonid
I. Brezhnev lived for 30 years was gone this morning, one day after
a Kremlin directive struck a new blow at the legacy of the disgraced
Soviet leader.
   The Tass news agency announced Thursday that the names of
Brezhnev and a later leader, Konstantin U. Chernenko, will be
expunged from every town, school and factory christened for them and
even from their former homes.
   The decision was the latest attack on the 18-year legacy of
Brezhnev. It added Chernenko to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign to condemn the corruption and stagnation of their rule.
   The plaque at 26 Kutuzovsky Prospekt called Brezhnev, who lived
there until his death in 1982, a distinguished figure of the
Communist Party, the Soviet government and the world socialist and
workers' movement.
   At the opposite end of the building, a tray under a plaque to
Yuri V. Andropov, Brezhnev's successor and a mentor to Gorbachev,
was full of artificial roses and tulips.
   The Communist Party Central Committee, the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet parliament and the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet,
``decided to drop the names of Leonid Brezhnev and Konstantin
Chernenko from all factories, administrative regions, institutions
of learning and organizations named after them,'' Tass said.
   ``In addition, memorial plaques will be removed from the houses
where they lived,'' it said. ``The latest decision was in response
to numerous letters and appeals to central party and state agencies
and to newspapers.''
   An announcement read on the evening TV news show Vremya said
Brezhnev's name will be removed from a factory and region of the
Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk, Brezhnev's power base, and from a
scholarship at Moscow State University.
   Chernenko's name will be removed from towns in the republic of
Moldavia and in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, and from squares
and streets in Moscow, the Moldavian capital, Kishinev, and
Krasnoyarsk.
   Renaming cities, neighborhoods, streets and factories is one of
the ways Soviet officials have rewritten history in their 71 years
in power, indicating which former officials and ideas are in favor.
   Many names associated with dictator Josef Stalin, his close
associates and Brezhnev have been removed in recent years. A
movement also has developed recently to restore prerevolutionary
names to many cities and areas.
   In January, authorities removed Brezhnev's name from a city, town
squares and a Moscow neighborhood and blamed the former leader for
fostering a period of cronyism and complacency. The city of Brezhnev
about 500 miles east of Moscow was returned to its previous name,
Naberezhnye Chelny.
   The Soviet press increasingly has criticized Brezhnev, who ruled
from 1964 to 1982. Historian Roy Medvedev said a weakened and senile
Brezhnev ruled for six more years after being revived from a
``clinical death'' in 1976.
   In July, the party newspaper Pravda said Brezhnev's survivors
would be stripped of unearned privileges and left only with
retirement benefits they earned with their own labor.
   Chernenko ruled only for 13 months after Andropov and was ill
most of the time. He died in March 1985, making way for Gorbachev.
Few things were named for Chernenko after his death, indicating the
low esteem in which he was held.
   In November, Tass announced that a passenger liner that was to
have been named for Chernenko would be given a different name.

   A group of former rose queens will take
the second ride of their lives, getting carried in style in a
horse-drawn carriage float in the 100th annual Tournament of Roses
Parade.
   ``I cannot believe I'll have the chance to relive the magic and
excitement I experienced as rose queen 59 years ago,'' said Holly
Halsted Balthis, 80, who wore the 1930 crown.
   Some of the former queens who gathered for a luncheon honoring
them Thursday will ride in a handcrafted carriage pulled by a
matched team of black horses on a carriage float titled ``A Rose
Queen is Forever.''
   Parade officials said it was the first time such a group of
former parade queens have been brought together to ride on their own
float.
   This year's rose queen is Charmaine Beth Shryock, a 17-year-old
Pasadena resident. The Westridge School senior is planning a career
in communications.
   The parade's grand marshal will be Shirley Temple Black, who also
led the parade 50 years ago when she was a 10-year-old film star.
   Mrs. Black, star of such film classics as ``Heidi'' and ``Curly
Top,'' made more than 40 films, sharing the spotlight with Ronald
Reagan, Spencer Tracy, Carole Lombard, Gary Cooper and Ginger Rogers.
   Monday's parade also will feature a wedding aboard one of the
floats. Carie Humphries, 21, and Ron Simms, 23, will recite their
vows on the ``Romance in California'' float in what officials say
will be the most widely witnessed American wedding.
   Officials estimate that the 60 floats, 22 musical units and more
than 250 equestrians will be viewed by 300 million people worldwide,
about one million of them at the parade site. About 50 television
cameras will line the parade route.
   The parade is followed by the Rose Bowl football game between the
University of Southern California Trojans and the University of
Michigan Wolverines.

   A strong earthquake rocked the
northeastern coastal city of Jayapura today, panicking residents but
causing no serious damage, the official Antara news agency reported.
   The quake, measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, occurred at about
9:30 a.m., Antara said. It said the earthquake sent many city
residents into a panic, particularly those working on the upper
floors of tall buildings.
   Antara quoted Setianto, provincial chief of the Meteorology and
Geophysics Agency, as saying the quake's epicenter was about 60
miles from Jayapura, the capital of Irian Jaya province.
   There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties,
the news agency said.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can cause serious
damage in populated areas. Every increase of one number in the scale
indicates a tenfold increase in the magnitude of the quake.

   A gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty
salon during a bungled robbery attempt had released all but one
woman today as police sealed off a three-block area, authorities
said.
   No shots were fired and no injuries were reported. The gunman
negotiated undisclosed demands with police, Sgt. William Muldoon
said.
   ``He is talking, so that's always a good sign,'' Muldoon said.
   The camouflage-clad man carrying a handgun took eight hostages at
about 3 p.m. Thursday in the Possibilities beauty salon but soon
released four people, including a young boy, police said.
   One woman was freed about 2:30 a.m. today and two others were
released shortly after 8 a.m. One woman remained in the salon,
police said.
   Authorities declined to say why the women were released, and did
not release the names of the freed hostages or the woman still being
held.
   Police Capt. Michael London identified the gunman as Michael
Fane, 21, of Mason City, Iowa.
   Police sealed off about three blocks in every direction.
Residents wishing to leave or enter the area were being escorted by
police, Capt. Robert Pfeffer said.
   The Rev. Mel Merwald, a Roman Catholic priest who spoke with
police about the gunman, said the man was ``not irritated.''
   ``The man is not really upset. He's really calm and that's a good
sign,'' Merwald said.

   A truck cab plowed into a line of cars
at the end of an expressway, causing a fiery, chain-reaction crash
that killed four people and injured 10, police said.
   ``Apparently, ... the (truck) driver had been driving too many
hours and fell asleep,'' said Master Sgt. Jerry Bresnahan of the
Illinois State Police. The truck, driven by Richard Hall, 37, of
Warrenville, S.C., was in the northbound lanes where the Edens
Expressway turns into U.S. 41 in this northern Chicago suburb when
the crash occurred at about 9 p.m. Thursday, Bresnahan said. The
stop light at the end of the expressway had just turned green, so
the seven cars involved in the accident may have been moving a few
miles per hour.
   The four people killed _ two men and two women _ were in the
first car hit by the truck, Bresnahan said. The identities of the
victims have not been released.
   Ted Holleb, 31, a manager at Timbers Charhouse, a restaurant just
west of the highway, said he saw the accident from the building
where he works.
   ``The truck rolled over on top of two cars. It looked like a fire
in the middle of the truck. At first it was small, but it grew very
fast,'' he said. ``Flames engulfed two or three cars.''
   Kelly Hoxie, the general manager of the restaurant, said he
helped rescue the truck driver.
   ``The driver kept saying, `I hope they get out. I hope they get
out,''' Hoxie said.
   Hall was in fair condition today at Highland Park Hospital,
Bresnahan said. Another man was in fair condition with a rib
fracture and eight others were treated and released.
   No charges had been filed in the case, Bresnahan said.

<HEAD>American Legion Recruiter Turned in Phony Registrations, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Legion commander allegedly
signed up 200 phony memberships, including a former German soldier
and several dead people, to win a Recruiter of the Year award, a
newspaper reported.
   Costa Mesa Post Cmdr. Robert Hanson, who was named the state
Legion's top recruiter in June, may have bought his way to the top,
according to a report detailed in Thursday's editions of The Orange
County Register.
   A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page
report signed Dec. 5 by state Cmdr. Andrew J. Steffanic.
   The state American Legion awarded Hanson its Recruiter of the
Year award at its Sacramento convention after Hanson submitted 801
new memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention.
   But the investigation found just 18 of the 801 applicants paid
dues by check, while Hanson wrote about 25 checks to the Costa Mesa
post for $8,250 from his own account.
   The report concluded, ``The question arises, was this an attempt
to simply buy a large roster of members? If so, it would constitute
an ominous attack on the integrity of The American Legion itself.''
   It recommended charging Hanson with violating the organization's
rules by using ``unorthodox and erroneous'' recruiting methods.
Hanson faces expulsion from the Legion, Steffanic said.
   Hanson, 67, declined to discuss the report.
   The investigation began after the Legion's national headquarters
received inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the
American Legion Magazine.
   The report said one of the letters was from a disabled man who
had never served in the military, while another was from a man who
had been a soldier in the German Army during World War II and was a
prisoner of war in the United States.
   Investigators found 205 apparent phony memberships, according to
the report. Some of the people contacted did not know Hanson, and
denied wishing to join or being eligible to join. Many were dead,
the report said.
   The report said Hanson was unable to explain why his membership
applicants said they never agreed to join.
   To be eligible, applicants must have been discharged honorably
from the U.S. military and have served in World War I, World War II,
the Korean War or the Vietnam War.

   The Coast Guard expanded its search today for six
crewmen missing from a Bermuda-bound container ship that sank in
rough seas and gale-force winds in the North Atlantic, leaving two
seamen dead.
   ``We continue the search as long as there's a chance of finding
them alive,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Arbogast said Thursday
night. ``We haven't found the second life raft'' from the ship.
   Three crewmen were plucked from the sea Thursday after the
254-foot Lloyd Bermuda sank Wednesday night. A fourth was found dead
and a fifth died on the way to the hospital.
   Two of the rescued men were transferred to the Coast Guard cutter
Tamaroa and were helping searchers with information on what happened
to their ship, Arbogast said.
   The victims were remembered at a ceremony today in Port Newark,
N.J., as friendly men who went out of their way to help others. The
Lloyd Bermuda had visited the port weekly.
   ``We are full of admiration for every one of the seafarers who
have worked. ... We know how important the spirit of cooperation is
to them,'' said the Rev. Barbara Crafton, maritime chaplain and
Episcopal priest. ``A seafarer is a brother to every other
seafarer.''
   At first light today, two Coast Guard C-130 airplanes, one Air
Force C-130 airplane, a Navy P-3 Orion airplane, two Coast Guard
jets, two Coast Guard helicopters and a National Guard helicopter
joined the search, Coast Guard Petty Officer Paul Scharlacken said.
   The Lloyd Bermuda sank about 160 miles south of Nantucket and 200
miles east of New Jersey when its cargo shifted in weather that was
``nothing short of horrendous,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf.
   Wolf said there was hope for the missing crewmen because the ship
went down on the edge of the Gulf Stream, where warm currents mix
with frigid Atlantic waters. Two of the rescued crewmen did not
suffer serious hypothermia.
   The ship's captain was American and the crew was a mix of
nationalities, John W. Moore of the Meyer Agencies Ltd., the ship's
agent in Bermuda, said in a telephone interview from Hamilton.
   The Lloyd Bermuda, registered in Cyprus, made a run to Bermuda
every week, and had left Port Elizabeth, N.J., Tuesday night with a
cargo including food and building materials, Moore said.
   Powerful winds hit the East Coast on Wednesday as a cold front
moved swiftly through the area and out to sea.
   Around 7:10 p.m., the ship's cargo shifted. The captain issued a
distress call, then called back a few minutes later to say he was
abandoning ship, Wolf said.
   The ship capsized and began to sink within five minutes of the
order to abandon ship, said Coast Guard Lt. Mike Humphreys, who
spoke to one of the survivors. The men took to two life rafts.
   Rescuers began searching a 700-square-mile area for survivors but
were hindered by heavy rains, 40- to 45-mph winds and 25-foot seas.
   Shortly after midnight Wednesday, a Coast Guard jet spotted three
people in the water waving flashlights. Sailor aboard the merchant
ship Eagle pulled two men from the water, but the third ``slipped
from his life jacket, fell back into the water and was not seen
again,'' Wolf said.
   The two survivors were treated for mild hypothermia.
   Around 4 a.m., a Coast Guard frogman from a helicopter rescued
two men drifting in the water without life rafts.
   They were flown to Falmouth Hospital on Cape Cod, but one man was
pronounced dead, apparently of hypothermia, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   The other man, identified as Dario Macio-Lopez, 35, was treated
for hypothermia, spokeswoman Marie Johnson said.
   At first light Thursday, a Navy pilot spotted what appeared to be
a man waving from a life raft. But when rescuers reached the raft,
they found nobody.
   Three hours later, rescuers spotted another man but, because of
choppy seas and floating debris, could not get close enough to tell
if he was alive. By the time a rescue helicopter reached him four
hours later, the man was floating face down.

<HEAD>Contract Awarded For Databank On Medical Malpractice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials today announced the award of
a $15.9 million contract to establish a nationwide data bank to
store information on doctors and dentists who are either disciplined
or sued for malpractice.
   The idea, contained in legislation passed in 1986, is to provide
a way for hospitals and state medical licensing boards to avoid
being duped by doctors and dentists who have run into trouble
elsewhere and try to set up practice in a new state.
   Each state maintains its own licensing procedures and the
legislation authorizing the data bank does not attempt to tell
states who they should or should not license or hospitals who they
should or should not hire.
   Information in the data bank will not be available to the general
public.
   The intent is to wave a warning flag at state licensing boards
and health facility employers so they can check further into a
doctor or dentist's record and then make their own decision on the
merits of each individual malpractice charge or disciplinary action.
   The five-year contract was awarded to UNISYS, an information
systems company with corporate headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa.
   The data bank is expected to become operational this coming
summer. The contract calls for the project to receive $3 million in
the current fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 30.

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and his estranged
wife, Robin Givens, may have spent the past few months trading
insults and lawsuits, but they spent Christmas Eve together at a
movie, a newspaper reported today.
   The New York Post reported in today's editions that the pair sat
side-by-side Saturday night in a Studio City, Calif., movie house
watching ``Hellbound Hellraiser II,'' a horror movie, the New York
Post said in today's editions.
   The Post said a source familiar with the boxer's daily activities
confirmed the movie meeting and said Tyson promoter Don King had
opposed the reunion.
   ``Mike was with her but there won't be a reconciliation,'' the
Post quoted the source as saying. ``The events are bizarre, but this
wasn't a wonderful experience for Mike.''
   The Post also said the couple's divorce settlement is almost
worked out.
   The newspaper said the deal would allow each to keep what they
have, with Tyson getting the Bernardsville, N.J., mansion, Ms.
Givens keeping the California house she owned before the marriage,
and Ms. Givens also keeping about $1.5 million she took from one of
Tyson's bank accounts.

   People fled in panic from the Funland park near the Clifton Beach

   The dead man was not identified but appeared to be about 20 years
old, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There was no immediate indication of who was responsible for the
6:15 p.m. blast. The explosion occurred on the Islamic faith's
weekly day of rest, a time when the park is crowded with
lower-income families.
   The site was about one mile from Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's

   A gunman lurking in an alley fired shots
through the kitchen window of an adjacent house, killing a woman as
she prepared dinner for her mother, police said.
   Sandra Davidson, 25, was struck in the head Wednesday as she
stood next to the sink opening a can of vegetables in her South
Central Los Angeles home, said Detective Adalberto Luper.
   A male friend of Ms. Davidson who was in the kitchen with her was
unhurt, police said. Family members identified him as Mike, a
homeless man whom Ms. Davidson occasionally invited in for a hot
meal or a couch to sleep on.
   ``Basically, we haven't determined if they were after him or
her,'' Luper said. ``That's still pending at this point.''
   The family said the attackers may have been gang members, but
police said they were not investigating the slaying as a
gang-related homicide. The neighborhood is a high crime area.
   Powder burns around the bullet holes on the window screen
indicated the shots were fired at close range from the alley just
outside the window, police said.
   Relatives remembered Ms. Davidson as friendly and outgoing.
   ``She was a sweet child, she didn't bother no one,'' said her
mother, Louise Davidson, 66.
   ``She's too beautiful to be dead,'' said her brother Thomas
Davidson, 27. ``We used to go fishing on the weekends. We were going
to go this weekend.''

<TEXT>
   An Iranian intermediary has approached the
United States offering to reopen diplomatic talks between the two
countries, but the State Department is holding out for ``a
substantive, up-front'' proposal, a U.S. official said Friday.
   ``It must come from someone in a position to make decisions,''
said the official in explaining why the department was cool to the
offer, which was channeled through an Iranian-American professor.
   The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
unidentified scholar, who teaches at a small college, was approached
by an Iranian who has a low-level job in the foreign or justice
ministry in Tehran.
   The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since
1979 when militants seized and sacked the U.S. embassy, taking the
Americans there hostage. Most were held for 444 days before being
released.
   Currently, there are nine American hostages in Lebanon, all held
by a pro-Iranian group, according to the department's
counter-terrorism office.
   President Reagan in 1985 secretly approved delivery of U.S. and
Israeli weapons to Iran in an effort to encourage moderation in the
Tehran government and also to try to facilitate the release of
captive Americans.
   The Congressional and public uproar that developed when the
purchases became known in 1986 prompted the State Department to
insist on a public discussion with Tehran.
   ``Given our past experience in dealing with people who purport to
represent the Iranian government, it's clear we need to speak to
someone openly and up-front, someone in an authoritative position,''
the U.S. official said.
   Several indirect overtures from Iran were received in the past
and did not produce a substantive diplomatic dialogue between
Washington and Tehran. However, the United States is able to talk
indirectly to the Iranian government through a number of foreign
countries, including Algeria, Japan and West Germany.

<TEXT>
   A military tribunal today found the son-in-law of
former President Leonid I. Brezhnev guilty of taking bribes and
abusing his office, and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp.
   Yuri Churbanov, who served as first deputy interior minister
during Brezhnev's years in power, systematically took thousands of
rubles of bribes instead of enforcing Soviet laws, said the judge,
army Maj. Gen. Mikhail Marov.
   The verdict came a day after the Kremlin struck a further blow at
the legacy of Brezhnev, accused of fostering a period of corruption
and stagnation, by ordering that a memorial plaque be removed from
his former home and that all factories and schools still named for
him be renamed.
   Churbanov originally faced the death penalty in the sensational
trial that began Sept. 5 on charges that he had accepted bribes of
more than $1.1 million.
   But during the trial the court threw out some charges and reduced
the amount of bribes he was accused of taking to $145,000.
Prosecutors had recommended a 15-year sentence.
   The 52-year-old Churbanov, who married Brezhnev's daughter Galina
in 1971, stood throughout the entire 3{ hour procedure at the Soviet
Supreme Court, staring calmly at the judge and two lay assessors.
   He did not react to the announcement of the verdict and sentence,
and declined to talk to reporters afterward.
   But his lawyer, Andrei Makarov, said the court's decision showed
that the Soviet Union is on the way to a society based on law.
   ``You can agree or disagree with the sentence, but in substance
the throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutors
is indisputable,'' he said.
   Churbanov was tried along with eight other former government
officials from the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan. One of the
eight was aquitted and the case of another, former Uzbekistan
Interior Minister Khaibar Yakhyayev, was turned back to prosecutors
for further investigation.
   Tashtimur Kakhramanov, a former deputy interior minister, who was
acquitted, took a seat in the audience after the court pronounced
him a free man. He broke down and cried, and nurses clad in white
came to assist him.

   Mercedes-Benz paid a record $20.2 million fine
today for failing to meet the government's fuel economy standard for
its 1986 model luxury automobiles, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration said.
   It was the biggest fine the government had ever collected for
gas-guzzling cars.
   Agency spokesman Tim Hurd said the German manufacturer's 1986
models averaged 21.3 mile per gallon compared with the government
standard of 26.0 mpg.
   Mercedes may be liable for an additional $5.5 million fine for
the 1985 model year under a preliminary decision by an
administrative law judge, Hurd said. The company is allowed to
appeal that ruling.
   In the 1985 model year, the requirement was 27.5 mpg and Mercedes
cars averaged 23.6 mpg.
   Federal law requires manufacturers and importers to pay a $5 fine
for every car sold that falls one-tenth of a mile per gallon below
the government's standard. They may earn credits for surpassing the
standard and apply the excess to model years that violate the rule.
   Mercedes had no credits for 1986. The $20,214,700 it paid was
$235 a car for 86,020 cars. Credits reduced the 1985 liability from
about $18 million, Hurd said.
   Telephone calls to the Montvale, N.J., office of the company's
U.S. subsidiary and its Washington lawyers went unanswered.

<HEAD>Chicago-born Emigre Gets Permission to Leave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago native who came to the Soviet Union
almost 60 years ago said Friday he and his family had won their
13-year fight to leave, ending one of the most mixed-up Soviet
emigration cases.
   Abe Stolar, his wife, Gita, and son, Michael, have been trying to
emigrate since 1975. At one point in the battle, the family got as
far as the entrance ramp of their plane when Soviet officials
stopped them, claiming Mrs. Stolar had access to state secrets in
her job as a chemist in a geology institute.
   ``There's no feeling yet. It's just a big mess thinking of all
the things we have to do,'' the 77-year-old Stolar, a Jew, said in
an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``They drag it out so long. It's been 13{ years. The main thing
now is to try to be calm and not to forget anything, which is hard.''
   Stolar and his family plan to go to Israel, but he said they did
not know yet when they will leave. After settling in Israel, he
said, the family will go to the United States to visit friends.
   Resolution of the case was another in a series of Soviet moves
under Mikhail S. Gorbachev to improve the country's human rights
record. Many Jews who were refused permission for years have
emigrated in the past year and a half.
   Stolar came to the Soviet Union as a teen-ager in 1931 with his
parents, who were Russian emigres and ardent communists. His father
died in Josef Stalin's purges. Stolar was disenchanted with the
country to which he came to help build the first communist power,
but he was stuck.
   Stolar was called up to fight in the Red Army during World War
II, where a Nazi grenade cost him the sight in his left eye. He
later served as a translator and announcer for Radio Moscow.
   Stolar holds U.S. citizenship, as does his son by virtue of
Stolar's birth and residence in the United States.
   The family was stripped of its Soviet citizenship in 1975. That
was when they were stopped at the entrance ramp of their plane. For
10 years the Soviets refused to let Mrs. Stolar leave. Their
belongings have remained in a warehouse in Israel ever since.
   In the mid-1980s the family received final permission to leave,
but Stolar had a new problem. His son's new wife, Julia, is a Soviet
citizen and her mother refused to sign a financial waiver allowing
her to go. The family refused to leave without Julia, and mother and
daughter have not been on speaking terms for many years.
   The Stolar case has been high on the list of U.S.-Soviet human
rights cases for years. Officials reported several times that it was
solved, but new problems cropped up.
   ``I have news now,'' an excited Stolar said, starting his
telephone conversation.
   Julia, who has a 2{-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son,
said in an interview that the Soviet Foreign Ministry told U.S.
Embassy officials about five days ago that her mother finally had
signed a release allowing her to go.
   She said she called the Soviet Visa and Registration Office,
OVIR, on Friday, and that Deputy Director Ilya Karakulkov had
confirmed that officials received the signed waiver. She said she
expects to receive official notification in the next several days.
   ``I'm sure there was pressure on my mother,'' Julia said. ``They
called her into OVIR several times.''
   She said she did not know why her mother finally signed the
release and ``in no circumstances'' would call her to find out.
   She said many Jews remain behind in ``hopeless'' situations
because their relatives refuse to sign waivers permitting them to
emigrate.
   Michael, 29, said he had ``no special feelings.'' He said he
worried about friends who want to emigrate but don't have the U.S.
government on their side, like his family did.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who met with Stolar, credited Gorbachev
for the decision to allow Stolar to return to the United States.
   ``I've worked on hundreds of Soviet emigration cases over the
years, and this has been the toughest and the most frustrating,''
Simon said from his home in Makanda, Ill.
   ``I don't believe it would have been settled without President
Gorbachev's direct involvement. It's also a hopeful sign about
Gorbachev's struggle with his own bureaucracy. Abe Stolar loves his
hometown, and we're going to give him a grand tour when he comes
back.''
   Simon said the Chicago Hilton has agreed to put Stolar and his
family up free of charge when he returns. Stolar had told Simon a
boyhood dream was to stay a night and ``live like a king'' in the
old Steven Hotel, which is now the Hilton.
   Stolar told Simon: ``We're trying to make plans. We just want to
find a small quiet town, someplace green, no hurly-burly. I hope I
can find work.''

<HEAD>African Students Say Authorities Charge They Have AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NANKING, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Racial conflict between African and Chinese
students was reported in another city Friday, and more than 60
Africans were sequestered in a dormitory to protest allegations by
authorities that they have AIDS.
   The incident at the Zhejiang Agriculture University in Hangzhou
took place against the backdrop of continued anti-black
demonstrations in Nanking, where Chinese students are demanding that
African students involved in a Christmas Eve brawl be punished.
   Martin Ayuk, a student from Cameroon, said the problems in
Hangzhou, 143 miles southeast of Nanking, began Dec. 23 when a
university operator started telling all incoming Chinese callers to
the foreign students dormitory that all African students were
infected with AIDS.
   African students asked the university for an explanation but were
not satisfied by a meeting with a university official, ``so we began
our boycott,'' Ayuk said in a telephone interview from Hangzhou.
   On Wednesday, a school finance officer came to the dormitory and
students locked him in the office of the gatekeeper, Ayuk said. The
official escaped through a window at 5 a.m. Thursday after nine
hours in captivity when the African students were asleep, he said.
   Ayuk said he believed the Chinese were prejudiced against all
foreigners, but most strongly against Africans.
   He said the Africans had been given a nickname in Hangzhou:
``aizu bing,'' the Chinese words for AIDS.
   A student at the agricultural college from the Congo was sent
home in November after he tested positive for AIDS, but all the
other African students have tested negative for the disease, Ayuk
said.
   China, which has so far escaped the AIDS epidemic, requires all
foreigners who live in China to undergo a test for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   An African student at Zhejiang University, also in Hangzhou, said
police were not allowing other African students to leave the city.
   ``Today I wanted to go to Shanghai but I wasn't able,'' said
Pierre Dujo, of Cameroon. ``The police are preventing us from buying
tickets.''
   Another African said he believed the Chinese were using the fear
of AIDS to restrict contact between Africans and Chinese.
   ``They can't stop the contact between us and the Chinese,'' said
the student from Zhejiang University, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We have many very good, deep friendships so what
they're doing is using this to scare off the Chinese.''
   Ayuk said hot water had been turned off in the dormitory and the
canteen was closed. He said students were cooking in their rooms
with what little food they had.
   There are an estimated 1,500 Africans from 40 nations studying at
Chinese universities. China has long provided scholarships for
Africans in a show of solidarity with developing African states, but
social tensions, which Africans attribute to ingrained racial
prejudices against blacks, have on occasion erupted into violent
incidents between the Chinese and the Africans.
   In Nanking on Friday, about 140 African students continued to be
held at a guest house of a chemical fiber factory outside the city.
   City authorities forced the Africans to the guest house Monday
night, ostensibly to protect them from angry Chinese mobs. They have
rejected the students' requests to leave Nanking.
   During demonstrations Saturday and Sunday, thousands of Chinese
threw rocks at African students and destroyed property in their
dormitory rooms. The Chinese have demanded the Africans be brought
to justice for allegedly starting a fight on Christmas Eve at Hehai
University in which 11 Chinese were injured.
   Ye Chunsheng, vice director of the Jiangsu Provincial Educational
Committee in Nanking, said Friday the incident was under
investigation and that about seven African students would be
punished.
   He said the Africans were not cooperating in the investigation.
``They've locked their doors in the guest house and we can't get in
to talk with them,'' he said.
   Yang Ruiju, president of Hehai University, said on Thursday that
no Chinese would be punished for the clash and subsequent anti-black
demonstrations.
   As of Friday evening, the streets of Nanking were quiet for the
first time since the initial clash Saturday.
   On Thursday, seven Africans and one student from Bangladesh left
the Nanking Polytechnical Institute under police escort for the
train station, where they traveled to Shanghai, said a student from
the Comoro Islands. He would only identify himself by the name of
Bourhane.
   Bourhane said the Africans, from Sudan, Somalia and Congo, were
not involved in the incident, but felt endangered in Nanking and
wanted either to leave China or study in another city.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Government Plan to Put 9,000 Blacks In Homeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Friday blocked the
government from proceeding with plans to place 9,000 rural blacks
under the jurisdiction of a tribal homeland against their wishes.
   The ruling came hours after President P.W. Botha issued a
proclamation that the Braklaagte community would become part of the
nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana on Saturday.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice T.T. Spoelstra blocked immediate
implementation of the proclamation and gave the government until
March 7 to show why its plan shouldn't be invalidated.
   The leader of the Braklaagte community, Chief Pupsey Sebogodi,
contended in court papers that his people faced hardship and
discrimination if they were incorporated into Bophuthatswana. They
live in a farming area about 100 miles west of Pretoria.
   The community has voiced opposition in the past to the
Bophuthatswana government and has sought to retain South African
citizenship because of advantages in seeking employment. Residents
feared that if they were incorporated into Bophuthatswana, they
would be victimized unless they became citizens of the homeland.
   The intended incorporation was part of the government's
longstanding and controversial policy of locating various black
ethnic groups in self-governing or nominally independent homelands
to reduce the proportion of blacks to whites in the rest of South
Africa.
   This policy suffered major defeats in court twice in 1988.
   The country's highest court, the Appeal Court, ruled in April
that Botha acted without authority when he incorporated the
120,000-member community of Moutse into the adjoining,
semi-autonomous homeland of KwaNdebele, northeast of Pretoria.
   The incorporation provoked widespread violence in Moutse, where
most residents do not belong to the Ndebele tribe that predominates
in KwaNdebele.
   In August, the Orange Free State provincial Supreme Court
rejected a government plan to place Botshabelo, a vast black
shantytown, under the jurisdiction of the Qwaqwa, an impoverished
homeland 180 miles away.
   A three-judge panel said the merger would not promote the
political development of Botshabelo's estimated 500,000 residents.
   Zach de Beer, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, criticized the attempt to excise Braklaagte from South Africa.
   ``After the abject failure of the homelands policy during many
years ... it is almost incredible that as 1989 opens, the government
should yet again be forcing South Africans against their will to
become inhabitants of one of these places,'' he said.
   Bophuthatswana is made up of seven separate pieces of territory
in north-central South Africa. It has an estimated 1.7 million
residents and covers 18,000 square miles.
   Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks in South Africa have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita appointed his second
justice minister of the week Friday as his scandal-buffeted
government lurched toward the end of what commentators are calling a
gloomy year in Japanese politics.
   Takeshita had to reach outside the world of politics to name a
new justice minister, picking Masami Takatsuji, 78, a former Supreme
Court justice with experience in drafting legislation as a
bureaucrat in the 1960s and 1970s.
   On Tuesday the prime minister appointed Takashi Hasegawa, a
76-year-old member of parliament, to the justice portfolio.
   But Hasegawa lasted only 60 hours _ said to be a postwar record
for short Cabinet tenure _ as it became known he had received
donations for years from Recruit Co., which the Justice Ministry is
investigating on suspicion of bribery.
   At the root of Japan's political gloom is the scandal involving
the Recruit conglomerate, whose founder sold unlisted shares of a
subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and
business leaders. The share prices more than doubled when they were
publicly listed in 1986, and the holders made fat, tax-free profits
when they sold.
   The Recruit scandal has been dubbed the top story of the year by
Japanese media, rivaled only by the similarly downbeat story of the
illness of Emperor Hirohito, 87, who has been bedridden with
intestinal hemorrhaging since Sept. 19.
   ``The year 1988 was an indescribably gloomy one for Japanese
politics, and one that calls for much soul-searching,'' commentator
Minoru Tada wrote in Friday's Japan Times. He said Japan's
leadership ``is deeply tainted by money power.''
   An editorial Friday in the Asahi SHimbun, another newspaper, said
the just-concluded session of parliament ``showed Japanese politics
at its ugliest and most corrupt.''
   As Hasegawa gave up the justice portfolio Friday, some opposition
leaders and analysts said Takeshita should resign his entire
government and call elections.
   Takeshita, who had appointed Hasegawa Tuesday along with a new
Cabinet in a drive to restore public confidence in government, did
not immediately comment on the major setback.
   Instead, the outgoing and incoming justice ministers spoke to
reporters. Hasegawa apologized and said he hadn't known until
Wednesday that Recruit had been giving money to his political
support organization since 1976.
   ``However, as minister in charge of clearing up the Recruit
problem in the Takeshita administration, which is trying to heighten
trust in government, it is regrettable that I received donations
from Recruit,'' he said.
   The scandal now has brought the resignations of 18 public figures
_ including two Cabinet members _ since it hit the front pages last
summer. Business leaders, top bureaucrats and news media executives
are among the casualties.
   After Hasegawa's donations from Recruit became known, three other
members of the Cabinet also said the company had donated to them,
making it apparent that Takeshita would have to go outside his
Liberal Democratic Party to find a justice minister untainted by
Recruit money.
   Takatsuji, who served on the Supreme Court from 1973 to 1980,
said he had no connection at all to the Recruit firm.
   ``I don't really have anything to say about Recruit,'' Takatsuji
said. ``My attitude toward it is no different from that of the
people in general.''
   Public approval of Takeshita's government has slumped badly since
he became prime minister in November 1987. A Mainichi Shimbun
newspaper poll in December showed his approval had dropped from 30
percent to 18 percent, and a Kyodo News Service poll showed his
approval rating down to 35.9 percent from 54.8 percent three months
earlier.
   Takeshita himself has a Recruit link since an aide and a relative
profited from shares in the Recruit-Cosmos subsidiary, but he says
he was not personally involved.
   His popularity also has suffered from the railroading of a
controversial tax reform through the Diet, or parliament.
   Some analysts expect Takeshita will face further setbacks if
there are arrests in the Recruit affair and as the opposition uses
the scandal to try to block passage of the budget in the Diet.
   ``Since Takeshita had advocated the importance of public
consensus ... he and his administration should resign as public
support goes lower,'' said Masayuki Fukuoka, a political science
professor at Komazawa University in Tokyo.
   Despite the polls, many analysts think the Japanese are inured to
shady practices under the governing conservatives, who have held
power for all the postwar years except for 10 months in 1947-48.
   ``The Japanese take it for granted,'' said Garrett N. Scalera,
president of the Tokyo Institute of Policy Studies. ``I think they
may be rather blase about this.''
   The pervasiveness of shady money was shown in a report issued
Friday by the National Tax Agency, which estimated that Japanese
firms had spent $456 million in 1987 on such ``shady expenses'' as
illegal political donations and back-door rebates to other firms.
The figure was a record, up 24 percent from the previous high in
1984, the agency said.

<HEAD>Soviets Allow Lithuanian Bishop To Resume Duties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government will allow Lithuanian
Bishop Juliajonas Steponavicius to resume his official duties after
nearly 28 years of internal exile, Vatican Radio said Friday.
   Steponavicius, appointed by the Vatican in 1957 as apostolic
administrator for the Lithuanian republic's capital of Vilnius, was
exiled to northern Lithuania in 1961 for refusing to collaborate
with Soviet authorities.
   The bishop has rejected Soviet invitations to return to Vilnius
because the offers did not permit him to resume his official duties
as head of the city's archdiocese, according to an official of
Vatican Radio's Lithuania-language section.
   This latest offer is without restrictions, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The radio aired a broadcast in
Lithuanian on Thursday night about the Soviet decision.
   The offer to Steponavicius comes just two months after the
Soviets decided to return the Vilnius Cathedral, which was converted
into a state art gallery in 1950, to the Roman Catholic Church.
   To celebrate the cathedral's return, the first Mass at the
cathedral in 30 years was held for 20,000 worshipers in October.
   A Lithuanian in Rome with close contacts in Vilnius said the
permission for Steponavicius reflects both the Soviet government's
need for popular support as it pursues its reform policies as well
as ``pressure'' from popular ethnic movements that have been testing
the Kremlin's tolerance.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of openness has allowed
Lithuanians and their Baltic neighbors to air their frustrations
about limits on religious practices under Soviet rule.
   About 3 million of the 4 million Roman Catholics in Soviet Union
live in Lithuania, which has a population of 3.5 million.

   A sophisticated device with two separate detonating
systems is believed to have triggered the bomb that brought down Pan
Am Flight 103, killing 270 people, The Times of London reported
today.
   The newspaper said crash investigators believe the first trigger
was a barometric device set off by altitude. This activated the
second trigger, an electronic timer, to make the bomb explode an
hour later, it said.
   Terrorists developed the double detonator technique after some
airports started putting cargo through pressure chambers that would
detonate pressure-activated bombs before they got on the plane, The
Times said.
   The Frankfurt airport, where the Pan Am flight originated aboard
a different plane, uses the pressure chambers, The Times said.
   On Wednesday, The Times was the first to report that
investigators concluded a bomb was responsible for the crash. The
formal announcement was made hours later.
   The Boeing 747 crashed Dec. 21 in Lockerbie, Scotland, en route
from London to New York. All 259 people on board were killed and 11
people on the ground were missing and presumed dead. So far 241
bodies have been recovered.
   An anonymous male caller claiming to represent the Guardians of
the Islamic Revolution, which last week said it blew up the plane,
telephoned American news agencies in London today and threatened
more action.
   He repeated the claim of responsibility and told The Associated
Press that unless the United States deports Reza Pahlavi, son of the
late Shah of Iran, ``there will be another present in the New Year
for America.''
   Last week's caller said the group attacked the plane in
retaliation for the shooting down of an Iran Air Airbus over the
Persian Gulf by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in July. U.S.
officials and terrorism experts said it was unlikely the group was
responsible for the Pan Am explosion.
   As a worldwide hunt began for the terrorists who planted the
bomb, passengers using American airlines at four British airports
underwent questioning Thursday and had their baggage X-rayed in
accordance with Department of Transport orders.
   British police today started security checks of the Frankfurt
airport. But a spokesman for the West German Interior Ministry,
Michael-Andreas Butz, said there were no indications of security
lapses that could have allowed the bomb to be smuggled aboard at the
airport.
   The FBI, Scottish police, the British anti-terrorism squad and
West German police also are investigating.
   Frankfurt's airport security chief, Horst Hanstein, said today
that luggage handlers and other ground personnel were being checked.
He did not elaborate.
   In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered visual
or X-ray inspection of all checked bags on U.S. airlines at 103
airports in the Middle East and Western Europe.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the change ``far exceeds
international standards'' and is based on practices of the Israeli
airline El Al, which has never had a bombing.
   Officials said the FAA is rushing delivery of devices that are
capable of detecting all known explosives, including plastic
explosives.
   Check-ins proceeded smoothly at London's Heathrow Airport, but
passengers were quizzed about who packed their bags, when they were
packed, whether the bags had been out of their sight and whether
strangers had given them parcels to carry.
   Their checked-in baggage was fed through X-ray machines and then
bound with a tough plastic strip to prevent them from being opened
en route to the planes. Some luggage was also hand-searched.
   Sam Fleischacker of Philadelphia, who was catching a TWA flight
to New York, said he flew to Britain the day after the Pan Am jet
crashed.
   ``What worries me a lot is the fact that they didn't have all
this then,'' he said, gesturing to the X-ray machine.
   The security directive was issued hours after Wednesday's
disclosure that a bomb brought down the jumbo jet. The security
directive took effect at Heathrow and Gatwick airports near London,
Manchester in northern England and Prestwick in Scotland.
   The airplane's nose cone, which had lain in a field outside a
church near Lockerbie, was moved today to the Royal Aerospace
Establishment at Farnborough, southwest of London.
   Investigators from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents
Investigation Branch will examine it there for clues about the bomb.
   Brian Jenkins, a U.S. terrorism consultant, said investigators
must check the background of each Flight 103 passenger and look for
false identities; discover whether any had connections that could
make them ``witting or unwitting confederates'' and trace cargo
items to their origins.
   ``The historical record suggests that in fact we probably will
eventually be able to identify a perpetrator,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp.
   Suspicion fell on Palestinian and Iranian extremists, and British
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe appealed to Middle Eastern
governments to cooperate.
   President-elect George Bush, vacationing in Texas, on Thursday
threatened retaliation, saying he would ``punish firmly, decisively,
those who did this _ if you can ever find them.''
   Washington has offered a $500,000 reward for information leading
to the prosecution of those responsible for the crash.

   Alec Smith, son of former Rhodesian prime
minister Ian Smith, is hoping to raise more than $250,000 for
starving children in a nation his father battled.
   The younger Smith has organized a ``Goal Against Hunger'' soccer
match between European champion PSV Eindhoven and Racing Club of
Argentina, Latin America's current Super Cup winners. The Jan. 15
match will be the first of a series of fund-raising soccer matches
the 39-year-old Smith is planning to battle hunger in Mozambique.
   The money raised will buy food to be distributed through
charities already working in Mozambique, including Save the
Children, World Vision, Christian Care and the Zimbabwe Mozambique
Friendship Association.
   Ian Smith led white-ruled Rhodesia during a bloody seven-year
bush war that led to the independence of black-ruled Zimbabwe in
1980. Zimbabwean guerrilla bases in Mozambique were freqently
attacked by Rhodesian troops.
   The younger Smith, who joined the Moral Rearmament Movement in
Switzerland in 1979, returned to independent Zimbabwe to serve as a
Presbyterian chaplain in a national army led by former guerrilla
foes of his father.

   Russian-born cellist Mstislav Rostropovich

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and his estranged
wife, actress Robin Givens, went to a movie together Christmas Eve,
but that does not mean their on-again, off-again relationship is
back on, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The New York Post said that the couple who have spent the last
few months trading insults and lawsuits sat next to each other
Saturday night in a Studio City, Calif., theater watching
``Hellbound Hellraiser II,'' a horror movie.
   ``Mike was with her but there won't be a reconciliation,'' the
Post quoted a source it said was familiar with the boxer's daily
activities. ``The events are bizarre, but this wasn't a wonderful
experience for Mike.''
   The Post also said the couple's divorce settlement is almost
worked out.
   The newspaper said the deal would allow each to keep what they
have, with Tyson getting the Bernardsville, N.J., mansion, Ms.
Givens keeping the California house she owned before the marriage,
and Ms. Givens also keeping about $1.5 million she took from one of
Tyson's bank accounts.

   Boxer Mitch Green, who has fought heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson in the ring and on the street, was arrested
early Friday in Harlem on charges of driving while intoxicated and
drug possession, police said.
   The 31-year-old Green, whose driver's license already has been
suspended 54 times, was accused of possessing angel dust, or PCP,
said police Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   Green lost a bout with Mike Tyson for the United States Boxing
Association heavyweight title in 1986. On Aug. 23, Green and Tyson
scuffled outside a 24-hour clothing boutique in Harlem, but Green
eventually dropped assault charges he had filed against Tyson.

   A federal appeals court has refused for the
second time to dismiss a 47-count indictment against hotel queen
Leona Helmsley and her husband for conspiracy, extortion and tax
evasion.
   ``Her present appeal is nothing more than a repackaged version of
the first attempt,'' Judge Richard J. Cardamone of the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said in writing for the three-judge panel.
Their decision was released Thursday.
   Her lawyers said they were not prepared to comment.
   Mrs. Helmsley, her husband, building tycoon Harry B. Helmsley,

   The rights of two workers were violated when they

   The Atlanta office of the U.S. Department of Labor said Gary
Yunker and John Fuchko were demoted in violation of federal laws
protecting whistle-blowers. Both men filed complaints Nov. 2.
   ``We found the complaints were correct,'' Richard Robinette,

   But Georgia Power spokesman David Altman described the complaints
as groundless. ``We think the Department of Labor was rushed,'' he
said. ``It was incomplete.''
   Georgia Power appealed the decision and an administrative law
judge scheduled a hearing for Tuesday.
   The employees, after pointing out safety violations at the plant,
were told by superiors that it was not part of their responsibility
to make sure the problems were fixed, Robinette said.

   A fake sword that was to have been used in the battle scene was
in poor condition, and the director of the movie, Shintaro Katsu,
ordered the crew to replace it with another, Kyodo said.
   It said the real sword was used for an extended period of time in
the filming before the injury occurred.
   Police said they seized the sword and the rolls of film

   The new government, grappling with its first
crisis, has begun work on an economic program aimed at restoring
public confidence in the shekel and ending a speculative run on the
dollar.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres was expected to ask the Cabinet on
Sunday to approve the outlines of an economic recovery plan that
will be the most comprehensive since the emergency anti-inflation
program of 1985, analysts said.
   Israel radio reported Friday that Peres was considering a $600
million cut in government spending, an increase in fees for
government services, a reduction in subsidies for food and other
necessities, and an end to automatic cost-of-living salary increases
for workers.
   The Cabinet also was expected to approve a further devaluation of
the shekel, perhaps as much as 10 percent, the radio said.
   The new government, a coalition of the right-wing Likud bloc and
the leftist Labor Party that is similar to the previous government,
was installed Dec. 22. Peres, leader of the Labor Party, is the
former foreign minister.
   The government has spent the past week trying to stem a massive
buying binge of foreign currencies by the public and large financial
institutions.
   The Bank of Israel, the nation's central bank, on Tuesday
devalued the shekel 5 percent by adjusting the exchange rate to
1.680 shekels to the dollar from 1.599 shekels.
   On Friday, the central bank halted all foreign currency trading
to stop further speculative buying. The markets are expected to
reopen Tuesday after the New Year's holiday.
   Michael Bruno, the bank's governor, predicted on Israel radio
that once the new economic program is adopted, ``the public will
calm down and the markets will stabilize.''
   In the three days before trading was stopped, Israelis responded
to rumors of an impending devaluation by purchasing $285 million
worth of foreign currencies, mostly dollars. They apparently hope to
sell at a profit after the shekel is devalued.
   The Israeli economy faces other major problems, including an
industrial slump, rising budget deficits and inflation approaching
20 percent a year.
   Efran Kleiman, chairman of the economics department at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, noted that when the government introduced
its last emergency program in July 1985, prices were rising at an
annual rate of 440 percent or more.
   ``We don't have hyper-inflation anymore,'' he said. ``But the
government's idea now is the same _ not to do things unilaterally
but to get some kind of agreement, a social contract.''
   This will require support from Histadrut, the nation's massive
labor federation, which represents about 80 percent of Israel's
workforce.
   But Histadrut General-Secretary Yisrael Kessar said Friday that
workers can't be expected to relinquish their cost-of-living
guarantee unless they are assured of other compensation. Union
workers now get automatic pay increases equal to about 70 percent of
the inflation rate.
   But he added, ``This doesn't mean we don't want to be partners in
a comprehensive plan.''

   A 34-year-old woman foiled a would-be

stabbing him with his own knife, police said.
   The woman, who officials declined to identify, was in fair

said Thursday.
   Thomas Edward Kuranda, 24, of Stanton, was arrested for
investigation of kidnapping, attempted rape and attempted murder,
Bandurraga said. He was held without bail in the Orange County Jail.
   Both the victim and her alleged assailant suffered stab wounds,
bruises and cuts, the lieutenant said.
   Kuranda allegedly forced the woman into her car at knife-point
outside the laundromat and had her drive to nearby Cypress, where he
attempted to rape her, said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard
Olson.
   ``The man stabbed and choked the victim,'' Bandurraga said. ``She
resisted vigorously and screamed for help.''
   A Cypress resident overheard the woman's shouts and called
police, who caught Kuranda in a nearby back yard.

<TEXT>
   Air terrorism has spawned a grisly ``arms race''
between the security establishment and the ever-increasing
sophistication of the terrorist arsenal.
   As bomb-detection machinery has grown more refined, explosives
have become easier to conceal. As one security gap closes,
terrorists find another.
   Because of lack of personnel and the expense of operating X-ray
equipment, ``we are always at least two steps behind the
terrorists,'' Brian Orrell of the British flight engineers' union
said Friday, eight days after a bomb blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and leaving 11 on the ground
missing and presumed dead.
   But other experts say the quest for terrorist-proof air travel
has reached an outer limit beyond which it will become prohibitively
expensive or make flying unbearably uncomfortable.
   When air terrorism became a problem in the late 1960s,
authorities responded by transforming airports into fortresses.
   It now is routine for all passengers to go through metal
detectors while their hand luggage is X-rayed. Airlines especially
at risk, such as Israel's El Al, search all luggage by hand. At
Belfast airports, the Irish terrorist threat makes it necessary to
frisk not just the passengers but everyone else coming into the
terminal.
   Airlines insist that each piece of luggage match its passenger,
assuming that no bomber would travel aboard the targeted plane. So
terrorists have resorted to duping unwitting passengers into
carrying explosives onto planes. Passengers are regularly warned to
accept no baggage they haven't packed themselves.
   The search for suspicious objects has become much harder with the
advent of plastic explosives that give off virtually no detectable
odor. They are malleable enough to be shaped into a souvenir or
rolled wafer-thin to fit inside a suitcase lining. Detonators now
are small enough to fit into a suitcase lock.
   Moreover, the age of the metal-free handgun is looming. According
to David Kyd, spokesman for the International Air Transport
Association in Geneva, such a gun has been developed in Austria and
will be extremely hard to detect on X-ray screens.
   ``The sophistication and miniaturization of explosives has become
quite worrisome,'' Kyd said in an interview.
   According to David Learmount of the respected journal Flight
International: ``It's an arms race.''
   Bombs can be connected to barometric detonators that respond to
altitude changes. Airports have hit back by putting baggage through
simulated pressure to set off such bombs in safety.
   The terrorists, in turn, have come up with a double-device: the
pressure detonator goes off safely, but it activates a second timer
that will detonate the bomb in the air.
   The Times of London said Friday that this method was believed to
have been used on Flight 103.
   Kyd is optimistic that within two years, a highly advanced
explosives detector will become operational.
   Now being tested in U.S. laboratories, the machine bombards
objects with thermoneutron rays that detect telltale nitrogen
vapors. But to cover the vast amount of baggage moving through large
airports, it will have to be small, mobile and able to distinguish
explosives' vapors from those given off by aviation fuel, said Kyd.
   He said the biggest security hole now lies not in the terminals
where passengers arrive to catch flights but on the tarmac where the
planes are parked.
   Security, he said, is difficult to impose on the hundreds of
airport workers swarming about the tarmac. Many of the menial jobs
are held by low-paid immigrants who are vulnerable to bribery and
whose background is unverifiable in a security screening.
   ``We can put all the screens in place to check passengers and
luggage, but there's still the problem of direct access to aircraft
by people who are there to clean planes, fuel them and put food
aboard,'' he said.
   The weapons used in the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner by
Iranian extremists this year were probably smuggled aboard in
catering trolleys in Bangkok, Kyd said.
   ``A huge amount can still be done for security, but the fact that
it's possible doesn't mean it's feasible,'' Learmount said in an
interview.
   El Al is unique, he said, because ``Israel as a nation operates
in some respects under siege, under military conditions, and all its
citizens accept that. So its airline has to act in many respects
like a military operation.''
   El Al passengers have to check in three hours before takeoff,
their baggage is hand-searched, and the slightest irregularity in a
travel document can mean a polite but lengthy interrogation about
the passenger's origins, work, family, friends and purpose of travel.
   If another airline used such tactics on passengers, Learmount
said, ``I suspect they wouldn't keep on flying with you for very
long.''
   El Al has never had an aircraft bombed. But an El Al Boeing 707
was hijacked over Italian airspace by three armed members of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine on July 23, 1968. All
passengers and crew were freed over several days after the plane
landed in Algeria.

   Two French girls held hostage for 13 months
celebrated a belated Christmas on Friday with a party thrown by
their home town.
   But public rejoicing was tempered with suggestions that Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi used the children to boost his image.
   ``This is the end of a nightmare,'' Pascal Betille, father of
7-year-old Marie-Laure and 6-year-old Virginie, told hundreds of
people gathered in the public square of Ollioules in southern
France. ``This is happiness.''
   The girls, held by an extremist Palestinian group, were handed
over to French officials Thursday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli,
six days after Gadhafi called for their release.
   The children's mother, Jacqueline Valente, five Belgians and a
baby sister born in captivity remained in the hands of Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, backed by Libya. The group, suspected
in numerous cases of terrorism, accused them of spying for Israel.
   Doctors at a Marseille hospital said Friday the girls were in
good physical and psychological health.
   The children and their father attended the town party in
Ollioules, near the Mediterranean port of Toulon, before leaving for
a vacation at an undisclosed location.
   The French press welcomed the return of Marie-Laure and Virginie.
But it gave equal space to what the conservative daily Le Figaro
called ``nausea'' at the motive for the release.
   ``At the close of this ignoble drama ... there remains an
after-taste of bitterness,'' Le Figaro wrote. Gadhafi ``today wants
to play the role of Father Christmas.''
   The girls' freedom is widely viewed here as Gadhafi's effort to
boost his image at a time when the United States, alleging Libya has
a chemical weapons plant, issued threats of a military strike.
   ``This gesture by the colonel is not gratuitous when, once again
the object of American threats, he urgently needs to fine-tune his
image as a `reasonable' man of state ...'' commented the daily Le
Monde.
   The press also noted a renewed effort by Libya to improve
relations with the European Economic Community, which reduced
diplomatic activity with Libya following the U.S. raid on Tripoli in
April 1986.
   French officials said no conditions were made for the the release
of the girls.
   The only exchange, Le Monde quoted officials as saying, was
allowing Gadhafi to make a nice gesture.
   Gadhafi called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve. Once
freed, Fatah-Revolutionary Council, in a statement issued in Beirut,
Lebanon, said the girls were a ``gift to France'' from the children
of the year-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   They were taken captive Nov. 8, 1987, when the Silco, a sardine
trawler turned yacht, was seized off the Gaza Strip, according to
the captors' announcement.
   There have been reports the boat was actually seized off the
coast of Libya, highlighting the mystery that has surrounded the
hostages from the start.
   Le Monde quotes French intelligence sources as suggesting the
Belgian hostages may never have left Libya and that the girls may
have arrived there long before the official announcement Thursday.
   The hostages, who have received little public attention over the
past year, have been referred to in the French press as the
``forgotten hostages.''
   The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners held
hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions. They include nine
Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press who was abducted March 16,
1985.

   A semi-truck driver was arrested today after
he raced through morning rush hour at speeds up to 90 mph, ramming
his rig into at least 25 other vehicles, police said. At least two
people were seriously injured.
   ``People said he was just pushing people off the road,'' a police
dispatcher said.
   Sheriff's deputies chased the Peterbilt tractor-trailer rig for
about 30 miles before he pulled into a rest area on Interstate 35
near Devine, southwest of San Antonio. A group of citizens there
surrounded the driver until officers arrested him.
   Police found a small amount of cocaine in his rig, said
Department of Public Safety trooper Marshall Milikien. The man was
taken to the Medina County jail in Hondo.
   The first hit-and-run incident was reported shortly after 8 a.m.
on Interstate 10 near Comfort in Kendall County, about 40 miles
northwest of San Antonio, said Department of Public Safety trooper
Alvin Schacht.
   The trucker sideswiped a vehicle driven by Robert Etlinger of
Boerne, who was run off the road. When the rig didn't stop, Etlinger
gave chase but was unable to catch him, Schacht said.
   The trucker ``was running between 85 and 90 and he (Etlinger)
couldn't catch him,'' Schacht said.
   The truck eventually hit at least 18 cars in San Antonio and
seven elsewhere, police said. Many vehicles were sideswiped and
rear-ended.
   At least two people were seriously injured, said Department of
Public Safety trooper Marshall Milikien.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mercedes-Benz has paid a record $20.2 million
fine because its 1986 cars guzzled too much gasoline, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday.
   The luxury German automaker was fined because the 86,020 cars it
sold in the United States in the 1986 model year fell 4.7 miles per
gallon short of meeting that year's required fleet average minimum
mileage, 26.0 mpg, said Tim Hurd, spokesman for the agency.
   The law requires a fine of $5 for every tenth of a mile per
gallon that the standard is missed _ $235 a car in this case _ times
the number of cars sold.
   Manufacturers may apply credits earned by doing better than the
minimum in other years, but Mercedes exhausted all its credits in
the 1985 model year.
   An administrative law judge has proposed to fine the company
about $5.5 million for 1985, when the company's U.S. fleet averaged
23.6 mpg and the requirement was 27.5 mpg. Without credits, the 1985
fine would be nearly $18 million, Hurd said.
   The largest previous fine was $8.8 million paid by Jaguar in 1987
for shortfalls in 1985. Jaguar also paid about $6 million in 1986
for 1984 cars.
   Porsche paid $1.25 million in 1987 for 1985 cars, Hurd said.
Several smaller fines have been imposed, but he said he did not have
details at hand.
   Mercedes has 10 days to appeal the proposed 1985 fine, Hurd said.
   There was no answer Friday at the Montvale, N.J., offices of the
company's U.S subsidiary, and no one at the Washington office of its
lawyers could answer questions.
   In addition to the fleet average requirement, cars sold in the
United States also are taxed if they fail to meet a different
minimum standard.
   The current fleet average requirement is 26.5 mpg, and NHTSA is
considering where to set the benchmark for cars that go on sale next
fall for the 1990 model year.
   Individual cars carry an excise tax for falling short of 22.5
mpg. The tax starts at $500 and reaches $3,850 for cars that fail to
reach 12.5 mpg.
   Some Mercedes models are subject to the tax.

   They said as many as 10,000 letters had been sent to Cuomo and
that they had delivered petitions containing 25,000 signatures
seeking clemency for her.
   Neither Harris' lawyer nor family members could be reached
immediately for comment today.
   Other than to say clemency for Harris had been denied, Cuomo
spokeswoman Anne Crowley declined to discuss the matter.
   Harris has always maintained she meant to kill herself and not
Tarnower on March 10, 1980, when she drove to his house just north
of New York City from her home at the Madeira Girls School in
McLean, Va.
   Upset because he had taken up with a younger woman, Harris wound
up shooting Tarnower four times. She said the shooting was an
accident.
   The governor today granted clemency to two state prison inmates,
Bernice Lane and Emilio Vasgonez, who were serving 15 years-to-life
sentences on drug sale charges.
   In a statement issued with his clemencies, Cuomo said Lane and
Vasgonez were the only two inmates recommended unanimously, or even
by a majority of the lawyers who reviewed the clemency requests for
him.
   Inmates denied clemency can reapply after waiting one year.

   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
settled in Friday for their 21st New Year's holiday at the desert
estate of publisher Walter Annenberg.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said Reagan was
doing paperwork and possibly playing some golf.
   As he arrived here in brisk 50-degree weather on Thursday, after
a flight from Los Angeles, Reagan was greeted by Palm Springs mayor
Sonny Bono. The entertainer, who owns a restaurant in Palm Springs,
said the president urged him ``to turn the heat up.''
   The Reagans were going out to a private dinner at a country club
Friday night. They will remain at the Annenberg home for a New
Year's party Saturday night.
   As they have on two of the last three New Year's days, Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev are exchanging pre-taped greetings
for broadcast on television in each other's country.
   The Reagans are scheduled to return to Los Angeles on Monday and
spend a few days at their new Bel Air home before flying back to
Washington Jan. 5 for their last two weeks in the White House.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the offspring of leaders who
helped feed the bitter feud between their nations, were ``getting
along famously'' on Friday, sources said.
   Ms. Bhutto, who took office four weeks ago, met Gandhi for the
first time Thursday when he arrived in Islamabad for a seven-nation
South Asian summit that has been overshadowed by meetings between
the leaders of the region's two mightiest powers.
   The two held a second private meeting Friday, and Indian sources
said the talks were friendly and productive.
   ``Their talks have been very warm, very cordial,'' an Indian
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said there was
hope for ``a new face on the relationship between the two countries,
one of warmth, trust and confidence.''
   Another Indian source said: ``They're getting along famously.''
Pakistani officials declined comment on the talks.
   Before Gandhi returns to New Delhi on Saturday, India and
Pakistan are expected to sign three agreements, including one in
which the countries agree not to attack each other's nuclear
installations, Indian sources said.
   The others provide for cultural exchanges and an end to double
taxation in trade and commerce.
   The signings appear to be largely symbolic and designed to
emphasize hopes that new leadership in Pakistan will lead to better
relations with India.
   The cultural and taxation agreements were initialed about a year
ago by both countries.
   A verbal agreement on the nuclear non-attack pact was reached
three years ago during a visit to New Delhi by President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, the army general who overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father,
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1977. Bhutto was subsequently
executed after being convicted of what he said was a trumped-up
charge of conspiracy to murder a political opponent.
   Zia was among those killed Aug. 17 in an explosion that destroyed
an aircraft over Pakistan.
   Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi's first private meeting began at 9 p.m.
Thursday and lasted until 1:30 a.m., Indian sources say. The only
other people present were Ms. Bhutto's husband, businessman Asif
Zardari, and Gandhi's wife, Sonia.
   On Friday, the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers attended an
all-day session with the leaders of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal,
Bhutan and the Maldives as part of the fourth annual summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
   Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto then met again for more than two hours.
They were joined midway through the meeting by their foreign
ministers, Narasimha Rao of India and Yaqub Khan of Pakistan.
   The talks ``covered the whole gamut'' of problems between the
nations, including disputes in Kashmir and Punjab, the Indian
official said.
   In the last five years, Punjab has been the scene of India's
worst violence. More than 2,400 people were killed in the border
state this year by Sikh separatists. India claims Pakistan aids the
extremists. Pakistan denies this.
   Gandhi's mother and immediate predecessor, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was killed by two of her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984,
four months after she ordered an army raid on the Golden Temple in
Amritsar, where Sikh militants were holed up. More than 2,000
people, mostly Sikhs, were killed.
   The Kashmir border dispute dates back to 1947 when Moslem
Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India were partitioned along
religious lines. India claims a portion of the region lying in
Pakistan.
   The Indian official declined to give any details of Ms. Bhutto
and Gandhi's discussions, but said the leaders did more than outline
problems but discussed ``what we will be able to do about them.''
   Gandhi is to meet again with Ms. Bhutto on Saturday.
   Other participants in the summit are President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad of Bangladesh, President Junius R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka,
President Maymoon Abdul Gayoom of the Maldives, King Birendra of
Nepal and King Jigme Singhe Wangchuk of Bhutan.

   A retiree's dry sense of humor about the
1988 drought has earned him the title World Champion Liar.
   Roy Griesbach, a former home builder, received the honor this
week from the Burlington Liar's Club, which has been handing out the
annual award for more than half a century.
   His winning lie: ``The weather was so dry this past summer that
the only water one could buy was dehydrated in 16-ounce packages.''
   Sheree Bykofsky of New York City received an honorable mention
for a lie that she admitted was about herself: ``Last summer my wife
spent so much money in the shops of Woodstock, N.Y., that they have
renamed the town Out-of-Stock.''
   The dry weather led some people to send lies that have been heard
before, club Vice President Don Reed said.
   One of the most common repeaters was, ``The drought was so bad
that the trees were chasing the dogs.''
   In the interest of maintaining its amateur standing, the liar's
club has one rule: no politicians. ``They're professionals,'' Reed
said.
   ``We used to bar journalists,'' he added. ``But we feel
journalism has changed. They tell the truth most of the time.''

   One potato, two potato, three potato
more _ much, much more.
   CSX Transportation is giving away 250,000 pounds of potatoes
contained in two boxcars that derailed Dec. 22 in Jacksonville. The
spuds were on their way to Frito Lay Inc. in Orlando, where they
were destined to become potato chips.
   The boxcars are sitting in a freight yard in Jacksonville.
   ``I've been giving them to any charitable organization that would
come get them,'' said Tom Walker, freight damage prevention
supervivor for CSX.
   Social agencies are doing their best to pick up the potatoes
while they are fresh.
   City Rescue Mission workers spent all day Thursday transporting
the potatoes in a pickup truck and a delivery truck. The rescue
mission has started giving away 10- to 12-pound bags of potatoes.
   But Dan Ellison, manager of the mission's thrift store, said it
would take two to three weeks for the two trucks to empty the
freight cars.
   ``That's a pile of potatoes. I've never seen so many potatoes in
my life.''

<HEAD>Sandinista Paper Says Contras Tortured Prisoners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 44 Sandinistas freed by
Contra rebels say they were tortured during their captivity in
Honduras, the official Sandinista party newspaper said Friday.
   The prisoners arrived Thursday in Nicaragua under tight
government control. Only the party newspaper Barricada, the
pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diaro and Sandinista TV were
allowed to cover their arrival.
   Another 60 prisoners freed by the U.S.-backed rebels refused to
return to Nicaragua. They chose to remain in Honduras while seeking
permission to go to the United States, Mexico or Canada.
   Barricada said the 60 were ``false prisoners'' and El Nuevo Diaro
described them as ``mercenaries'' staging a Contra-directed
propaganda ``show.''
   Both Barricada and Nuevo Diaro said they interviewed some of the
44 who came home.
   ``They subjected us to hunger, torture and all kind of outrage.
They made me see death,'' Barricada quoted Natividad Matute Guillen
as saying.
   El Nuevo Diaro reported that 15-year-old Marvin Jose Palacio
Orozco said he was tortured ``with electric prods on my feet and
used like a punching bag.'' It said the Contras accused the youth of
being a Sandinista spy.
   Red Cross officials brought the prisoners across the border
Thursday, six days after the Contras freed them under pressure from
the Honduran government.
   The rebels say the prisoners were captured a year ago in combat
in the Nicaraguan provinces of Chontales, Matagalpa and Madriz.
   The Sandinistas have not said whether the freed prisoners
included members of the armed forces.
   Meanwhile, the government said nothing about the latest Contra
proposal for a new round of peace talks in Washington beginning Jan.
25.
   An uneasy truce has been in place in the 8-year-old war since
March.
   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in
February. About 10,000 rebels, the bulk of the fighting force, fled
to base camps just across the Honduran border, where they have been
supported by U.S. humanitarian aid.

<HEAD>FHA Begins Loan Program For Businesses Affected By Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farmers Home Administration said Friday it
will begin next week a $200 million loan guarantee program for rural
businesses that suffered from the 1988 drought and other weather
disasters.
   Acting FmHA administrator La Verne Ausman said the program was
authorized by Congress in the 1988 Disaster Assistance Act. New
regulations carrying out the program will be put into effect on Jan.
3, although they will have a 60-day period for public comment.
   Ausman said the agency ``can make any changes that may be
necessary after the 60-day comment period is over.'' Meanwhile, he
said, many rural businesses are in need of assistance. The maximum
loan amount is $500,000.
   Under the program, FmHA can guarantee up to 90 percent of a loan
``to help alleviate financial distress caused, directly or
indirectly, by drought, hail, excessive moisture or related
conditions'' that occurred in 1988, he said.
   The program will be similar in most respects to the existing FmHA
business and industrial, or B&I, guaranteed loans. The loans will be
made by regular commercial lenders at negotiated interest rates,
with FmHA guarantees providing protection against loss should the
loans fail.
   Ausman said the main difference is that the drought and disaster
program will guarantee only the principal, while the B&I program
guarantees both principal and interest.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Treasure Hunters Search Dump For Lost Lottery Ticket</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people are seeking their
fortune in the Managua city dump, scrambling through tons of garbage
in search of a lost lottery ticket worth $1,300.
   A restaurant employee mistakenly threw away the ticket on Monday,
the day before the drawing that made it worth 6 million cordobas, or
nearly 750 times the daily minimum wage.
   The owner of the restaurant, Andres Pastora, asked the National
Lottery to pay him anyway. But the head of the lottery, Luis Guzman,
said the prize will go to whoever presents the ticket.
   Pastora has offered a $100 reward, a sum several treasure hunters
scorned as a ``miserable tip,'' according to the daily El Nuevo
Diario.
   Sandinista TV and El Nuevo Diario showed pictures hundreds of
people picking through the municipal garbage Thursday and Friday for
the ticket.
   Dump employees said they burn trash every day and that it would
be a miracle if anyone found it. But the treasure hunters seemed
undeterred.
   ``It is worth making the effort,'' said Juan Jose Alvarado, who
is unemployed.
   The minimum wage in Nicaragua is 8,000 cordobas a day, or about
$1.70. A movie ticket or a pound of beef costs nearly half a day's
wage and a pair of imported jeans costs 90,000 cordobas.

   Some may call it a publicity gimmick, but
Bob Neel believes that revelers find his annual offer to pay funeral
costs for anyone killed in a drunken driving accident on New Year's
Eve a sobering thought.
   For the past 10 years, Neel's funeral home and cemetery has
offered a free casket, funeral service and burial to anyone killed
in a drunken-driving accident during the end-of-year celebrations.
   So far, no one has collected, and Neel thinks his offer has made
a difference.
   ``I can't prove it with statistics, of course, but I get so many
calls and letters you wouldn't believe,'' Neel said Friday. ``They
tell me it's made them more aware of drinking. I know it has me and
my friends. The publicity, I'm sure, has done some good.''
   Neel, chairman of Woodlawn Memorial Park & Funeral Home, started
the practice in 1979, and he believes he was the first to do so.
   ``I've been challenged on that by other funeral directors,'' he
said. ``But I know of no one who offers all of the services that we
do _ the family would not have to spend one cent.''
   Neel said the casket, grave, funeral service, minister,
embalming, flowers and incidentals would cost about $3,500.
   Originally, Woodlawn required that those who planned to drink and
drive over the holiday had to sign up to take advantage of the
offer. Later, Neel dropped that stipulation and just had people call
in beforehand.
   But for the past two years, all that a relative or friend of the
deceased had to do was come in after the accident and request the
funeral.
   The victim does not have to be the person driving. He or she can
be a passenger or an innocent bystander killed in a smash-up caused
by a drunken driver.
   To dramatize the project this year, Woodlawn dug a fresh grave
Friday morning, provided a vault and chapel tent and had a minister
on hand for television cameras and reporters.
   ``We pray that it won't be used,'' said Neel. ``It's an unusual
thing to do and publicize, but if we save even one life, it's worth
it.''

<TEXT>
   The government resigned Friday in
reaction to mounting criticism of its handling of an economic
crisis, the first to do so since the communists took power after
World War II.
   The move, a sign of the liberalization creeping into Yugoslavia's
one-party system, represented a further break with the legacy of
President Josip Broz Tito, founder of communist Yugoslavia and its
undisputed leader until his death in 1980.
   Premier Branko Mikulic told Parliament he and the entire
31-member Cabinet stepped down because legislators refused Wednesday
to pass an economic law needed to ensure continued support from the
International Monetary Fund.
   Mikulic, a 60-year-old economist and Tito ally who took office in
May 1986, was seen as a hardliner in the ruling Communist Party. His
resignation indicated that reform-oriented forces eager to adopt
Western-style changes are gaining the upper hand in a protracted
political struggle.
   Few Yugoslavs, however, expected Mikulic's resignation to bring
any immediate solutions to an economic crisis that has reduced
living standards by 50 percent since 1980.
   Foreign debt stands at $21 billion, unemployment at 15 percent
and inflation at around 250 percent _ three times what it was when
Mikulic took office.
   In a speech to Parliament broadcast on live national television,
Mikulic firmly rejected responsibility for the country's economic
and social woes. Effectively blaming the system bequeathed by Tito,
he said difficulties created in past decades could not be solved in
the 2{ years he has spent in office.
   Mikulic will stay in office as a caretaker premier until the
nine-man federal presidency names a new government in January.
   The complex federal system bequeathed by Tito stipulates that all
federal decisions must be unanimously agreed on by Yugoslavia's six
constituent republics and two autonomous provinces.
   In practice, this has meant that federal decisions are watered
down to ineffectual compromises that each region interprets as it
wants.
   Referring to Yugoslavia's maze of federal, republican and local
bureaucracies and laws, Mikulic told Parliament that decisions about
the economy are made in 7,000 to 8,000 different places, suggesting
it was unfair to blame the government.
   Falling living standards have provoked more than 1,000 strikes
this year in a country once hailed as a worker-managed state.
Discontent also has eaten at the prestige of the Communist Party,
whose membership has fallen steadily.
   Two Belgrade residents who asked not to be named said they
expected little to change after the first fall of a Communist
government in Yugoslavia.
   ``Did they fall indeed?'' a travel agent asked upon being told
the news. ``So who is going to congratulate us (for) the New Year?''
she quipped.
   A housewife shopping before the three-day New Year holiday
lamented the difficulty of making ends meet each month.
   ``So what do you expect will happen now?,'' she said. ``They are
all of a kind. They cannot do anything, or do not want to, except
build seaside villas at the expense of the workers.''
   She was referring to a scandal in Mikulic's native republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, where hundreds of party officials have been
accused of securing illegal loans to build themselves homes in the
Adriatic resort of Neum.
   Mikulic survived an attempted vote of confidence in May, when
parliamentary deputies from the liberal northern republic of
Slovenia and from Croatia failed to gain support from four other
republics for Mikulic's ouster.
   But criticism had mounted in recent weeks. Government minister
Oskar Kovac, who oversaw Yugoslavia's negotiations with its debtors,
resigned Dec. 5, citing unidentified pressures that hindered
market-oriented reform.
   Ironically, parliament on Thursday passed a package of economic
reform laws that should allow mixed ownership and greater foreign
investment _ measures economists have long prescribed for
Yugoslavia's economic ills.
   Increasing poverty has exacerbated traditional ethnic conflicts
among the more than 30 ethnic groups who make up Yugoslavia's 23
million citizens.
   But parliament on Wednesday defied Mikulic's warnings about the
need to live up to its obligations to the International Monetary
Fund, refusing to pass a law curbing public spending.
   Such austerity measures are a condition of IMF aid to
inflation-ridden countries such as Yugoslavia. Mikulic said the IMF
had demanded the law as a condition for granting the Belgrade
government a one-year, $416 million standby credit in June.
   Some $260 million of that credit has been used to date, according
to official estimates. The loan also encouraged Western creditors to
reschedule payments on Yugoslavia's mounting foreign debt.

   From a beekeeper and a mailman to a Rothschild and
three Olympic gold medalists, the humble and the powerful were
rewarded Saturday for good works and political loyalty in that grand
old British tradition, the queen's New Year honors list.
   Sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi is knighted, as is Leon Brittan, the
former Trade and Industry secretary who resigned in controversy in
1986. Michael Holroyd, biographer of George Bernard Shaw, becomes a
Commander of the Order of the British Empire, as do actor Ian
Richardson and Christopher Hogwood, director of the Academy of
Ancient Music.
   Queen Elizabeth II bestowed 907 titles and medals _ most of them
to people selected by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
for the twice-yearly expression o gratitude. They will be joined in
June by hundreds more from the queen's birthday list.
   Although critics say the ancient honors tradition has been
tarnished by political patronage, a barony, a knighthood or a
British Empire Medal is still a glittering prize to be treasured for
life and remembered with pride by one's descendents.
   Barons and baronesses are addressed as lords and ladies and can
sit in Parliament's unelected House of Lords in the company of
Britain's ancient aristocratic families. Knights are addressed as
sir, and their female equivalents are dames. An Officer of the Order
of the British Empire gets to add OBE after his or her name.
   There is no cash reward but to many the rise in status is
priceless. For the public at large, it is an occasion to reflect on
heroes both sung and unsung, like Domingos Joseph Diago Teodoro
Pinto. The Northern Ireland doctor got an OBE for leading the
medical team that treated casualties in an Irish Republican Army
bombing that killed eight soldiers.
   This power to pander to vanity prompts accusations _ firmly
denied _ that prime ministers use the honors to repay political
cronies and party fund donors.
   Political loyalty is warmly rewarded each year. Brittan, awarded
a knighthood, was a close Cabinet ally of Mrs. Thatcher before he
resigned for approving the leak of a controversial letter during a
government crisis. He is now one of Britain's two commissioners on
the European Economic Community's administrative body.
   The government, underlining Mrs. Thatcher's new commitment to
conservation, recommended honors for several guardians of the
environment this year. The highest goes to Cambridge University
chemistry professor Jack Lewis, who chaired a commission on
environmental pollution. He becomes a life baron.
   Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N.M. Rothschild and Sons and
member of the British branch of the illustrious banking family,
becomes a knight, as does Geoffrey Owen, editor of the respected
Financial Times newspaper.
   Following the peerages and knighthoods, the highest honors belong
to the Order of the British Empire and its Commanders (CBE),
Officers (OBE), and Members (MBE).
   Michael McIntyre and Philip Vaile, yachting gold medalists at the
Seoul Olympics, receive MBEs, while Richard Dodds, captain of the
gold-medal-winning hockey team gets an OBE.
   An OBE goes to Bob Littlewood, 57, who masterminded the four-year
reconstruction of the badly burned south transept of York Minster,
the medieval cathedral where his family has worked for three
generations. Littlewood supervised the craftsmen who worked in
stone, wood and stained glass and the queen celebrated the completed
work this year, 12 months ahead of schedule.
   William Hooper, vice-chairman of the British Beekeeping Society
becomes one of 306 new MBEs. Leslie Quantrill, postman, wins a
British Empire Medal.
   An MBE also goes to darts champ Eric Bristow, one of Britain's
most recognizable sportsmen. The rotund ``Crafty Cockney,'' reckoned
the greatest darts player in history, becomes the first in his field
to win such an honor.
   Actress Penelope Keith, known to U.S. TV audiences for her role
in ``To The Manor Born'' and ``The Good Neighbors,'' and actor
Richard Briers, who also appeared in ``The Good Neighbors,'' receive
OBEs, as does horror film actor Peter Cushing.
   Richardson, honored with a CBE, portrayed spy Anthony Blunt in
the BBC-TV play ``Anthony Blunt'' in addition to many film and stage
roles.

fired off a poem to the police with the $10 payment for the parking
ticket he received at 4:30 a.m. two days before Christmas for
illegally parking on a dead-end street.
   The poem reads in part:
   ``I'll remember your deed at the `Policemen's Ball,'
   You'll attend this winter in the Country Club hall,
   For that's where I work, so this should be fun,
   Your soup will be cold, and your steak overdone.''
   Sabinsky said he was surprised when he received his $10 check
back from the police department.
   ``I really had not expected it,'' Sabinsky said. ``I just wanted
to have a little fun.''
   Chief William Andersen said police face a no-win situation since
other residents are concerned that traffic enforcement is not strong
enough.
   ``We are paid by the taxpayers to enforce the law,'' Andersen
said.
   From Nov. 25 to Dec. 24, police issued 1,114 summonses for all
traffic offenses, including speeding, drunken driving and moving
violations, Andersen said. During the week before Christmas,
officers issued 93 written warnings rather than writing tickets
bearing fines, he said.

<HEAD>Afghan Government Declares Cease-fire; Guerrillas Reject It</HEAD>

   Soldiers of the pro-Soviet Afghan
government will cease firing on U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas next
week and will refrain from attacks as long as the insurgents do,
Afghan President Najib said Friday.
   But a guerrilla spokesman in Islamabad said the insurgents would
keep fighting in the 10-year war, rendering the truce meaningless.
   ``All sections and divisions of the republic's military forces
have been given an order to observe a cease-fire from Jan. 1 in
conditions in which the opposite side will refrain from direct
attack,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Najib as
saying on Afghan television.
   Afghan government radio said Moslem insurgents will be given four
days to accept the truce. If they refuse, government troops will
start shooting again, said Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad.
   The truce was dismissed by Masood Khalili, a spokesman for the
Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group. Its leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani,
met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov in Saudi
Arabia last month.
   ``We did not start our fight because he asked us to, and we won't
stop because he asked us to,'' Khalili said. ``He won't have any
cease-fire because mujahedeen (holy warriors) won't stop fighting.''
   Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan in December 1979 to help
the communist government fight the guerrillas.
   In April, Moscow signed a U.N.-brokered accord providing for the
withdrawal of more than 100,000 Red Army soldiers by Feb. 15, 1989.
Half had left by Aug. 15.
   Soviet officials say the withdrawal was halted because of
continuing U.S. and Pakistani aid to the guerrillas.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech to the United
Nations on Dec. 7, proposed that a cease-fire begin in Afghanistan
on Jan. 1 and that all military supplies be cut off.
   The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered in
Pakistan rejected the cease-fire.
   Najib also declared a cease-fire that began Jan. 15, 1988, but
the insurgents ignored it and the fighting continued.
   Khalili said the fighting won't stop until Najib and his ruling
Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan leave Kabul.
   Vorontsov also has met former Afghan King Zaher Shah in Italy to
discuss a plan for convening a council of 50 to 60 politicians or
prominent public figures to create a new government.
   Khalili said Moscow has escalated the fighting inside Afghanistan
within the past two weeks. He said the Panjshir Valley commander
Ahmad Shah Masoud reported civilian casualties were heavy after
bombing raids in the northern Takhar provincial capital of Taloqan.
   There also were indications the guerrillas planned to step up
their offensive.
   Leaders of the Pakistan-based Afghan guerrilla alliance left
Tehran on Friday after apparently working out a joint strategy with
Iranian-backed rivals aimed at toppling the Kabul regime and
installing an Islamic government, Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency said.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the Pakistan-based guerrillas,
led by Rabbani, were seen off at Tehran's Mehrabad airport by
Mohammad Karim Khalili, a leader of the Iran-based coalition.
   The two guerrilla groups declared Tuesday, the ninth anniversary
of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, that they will not accept any
cease-fire until all the Soviets have left and Najib's government
has been toppled.
   The eight-party Iran-based group is Shiite Moslem, like most
Iranians; and the Pakistan-based alliance is Sunni Moslem. Shiites
make up about 20 percent of Afghanistan's 13 million people.
   In the past, the radical Shiite factions have largely operated
separately from the Pakistan-based groups and taken a more extremist
Islamic position about the role of religion in any future Afghan
government.
   The Iranians, who are improving relations with the Soviets after
years of strain, have been trying to reconcile the two guerrilla
coalitions in the hope of producing an Afghan government dominated
by the Moslem insurgents.
   The Soviet withdrawal has been hampered by unremitting attacks by
the estimated 200,000 Mujahedeen.
   The 50,000-60,000 Soviet troops still in Afghanistan are believed
to be concentrated in two evacuation corridors in the east and west
while the guerrillas battle against the increasingly demoralized
Afghan army in worsening winter conditions.

   Leading supporters of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms said in a letter published Friday that his
policies are being bogged down by a Communist Party ``dictatorship
of mediocrity'' that ought to resign.
   Six artists, directors and editors, in an open letter to
Gorbachev, said elections for a new government structure, a Congress
of People's Deputies, will determine real power in the Soviet Union.
They pledged all-out support for Gorbachev.
   But they said that a campaign begun after the June party
conference in Moscow to review nearly 20 million party members with
a view toward their support for Gorbachev's reforms had been
hampered by too many directives.
   They said that experience made them doubt whether the elections
would firmly implant reformers throughout the Soviet system.
   ``Can it be said that we are entering the new year and moving
toward elections with full confidence in the irreversibility of the
democratic renewal of society?'' they asked. ``One would very much
like to answer that question positively. But a feeling of sensible,
realistic responsibility holds us back from such an evaluation.''
   The writers said a ``dictatorship of mediocrity'' was rampant,
not only among individual conservatives who remain in the party
apparatus, but throughout the entire Communist Party headquarters.
   The letter was published in the Jan. 1 edition of the weekly
Moscow News, which was released Friday. It was signed by Grigory
Baklanov, editor of the monthly literary journal Znamya; playwright
Alexander Gelman; author Danil Granin; film producer Elem Klimov,
actor Mikhail Ulyanov; and space scientist Roald Sagdeyev.
   Speeches by Baklanov and Ulyanov both caused sharp disputes with
conservatives at the June party conference.
   Gorbachev has sought to get the party out of day-to-day
management, leaving that to local economic and government officials.
But the party retains final authority and has shown no sign of
tolerating any opposition.
   The writers said that there undoubtedly must be opponents of
Gorbachev's reforms in Soviet society, and that they must be able to
state their ideas. But it said party members who oppose Gorbachev's
reforms must be judged severely.
   ``Those who do not agree with the new course must retire,'' they
said.
   The six also appealed for more tolerance of informal political
and social organizations that have sprung up in the freer atmosphere
fostered by Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``If we don't find the path toward cooperation with dissidents, a
temptation to rush to repressive measures probably will arise _ and
already has arisen _ with all the anti-democratic consequences that
flow from this,'' they said.
   Cooperation with dissidents ``not only doesn't weaken, but on the
contrary, strengthens the authority of restructuring'' they said.

   Sales of new homes, hurt by a big slump in
activity in the Northeast, declined by 8 percent in November, the
largest setback in 18 months, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said that new single-family homes were
sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671,000 units last
month, down from a revised October sales rate of 729,000 units.
   The November decline was the second in the past three months and
the sharpest since an 11.6 percent decrease in May 1987. Sales had
risen 4.4 percent in October.
   While three of the four regions of the country showed sales
declines from October to November, the biggest by far was a 27.3
percent plunge in sales in the Northeast.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said the latest decline reflected a further cooling
off of the Northeast market, which had been the hottest sales area
for the past several years.
   ``An awful lot of weakness has developed in the Northeast market,
while the West has been surging,'' Seiders said. ``For the first 11
months of the year, we have seen about a 15 percent decline in the
Northeast, compared to the same period a year ago, while sales in
the West are up by about 10 percent.''
   The regional cross-currents have resulted in total sales
nationally holding essentialy unchanged from the 1987 level of
671,000 new homes sold.
   However, Seiders predicted that new home sales would drop by
about 6 percent in 1989, reflecting slower economic growth and
higher mortgage rates.
   He predicted that mortgage rates could rise as high as 12 percent
by mid-year.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported Friday that rates
rose to 10.77 percent in the week just ending, up from 10.68 percent
a week ago, and the highest level since early November 1987.
   Richard Peach, senior economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association, also predicted mortgage rates would continue rising,
but he said the fact that existing home sales showed an increase in
November should be viewed as a good sign that the bottom is not
falling out of the housing market.
   ``The numbers this month suggest that some buyers are switching
from new homes to existing homes, particularly in the Northeast,
because they believe they represent a better value,'' Peach said.
   The decline in sales was accompanied by a drop in prices. The
median price of a new home fell 4.2 percent to $110,200 in November.
The average price was down as well, declining by 0.8 percent to
$138,900.
   In addition to the Northeast, sales were off 7.5 percent in the
South to a rate of 245,000 units and down 6.8 percent in the West to
a rate of 233,000 units.
   The Midwest was the only region of the country to enjoy a rise in
sales in November, a 5.2 percent increase to an annual rate of
121,000 units. This region is currently benefiting from a rebounding
economy as the area's manufacturing industries enjoy rising demand
from a boom in U.S. exports.

<HEAD>Politburo Criticizes Food Distribution After Quake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kremlin commission overseeing earthquake relief
efforts sharply criticized food suppliers in Armenia, saying their
lack of vigilance has led to rumors of unfair food distribution,
Tass reported Friday.
   In another report, Tass said Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov
called for an improved civil defense system to react to disasters
like the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people.
   The official news agency, in a report from the Armenian capital
of Yerevan, said the Politburo commission led by Yuri Balatin warned
that officials responsible for poorly organized food supplies to
devastated northern Armenia would be held personally responsibile.
   ``The work style of a number of officials is limited to commands.
They do not actually have the situation in hand and do not make spot
checks to exercise control at local level,'' Tass said.
   Lack of control ``has led to contradictory and unfounded rumors
about an allegedly unfair distribution of relief aid,'' it said. It
did not elaborate.
   Tass also said 34 food stores reopened in the city of Leninakan,
Armenia's second-largest with a population of 280,000 before the
earthquake. Ten fruit and vegetable stores and nine department
stores also reopened, it said.
   On Thursday, Armenian officials said the number of bodies
recovered was fewer than 25,000 and that only about 100 remained to
be found. They blamed the initial death toll estimate of 55,000 on
information based on the amount of physical destruction and the
disruption of communications and transportation.
   Many Armenians are still homeless and ailing, and foreign
volunteers will be needed there for up to two years, West Germany's
Red Cross president said.
   ``There is tremendous fear even now about the possibility of
aftershocks, so even the little housing that is habitable in the
worst-hit areas is being avoided,'' Botho Wittgenstein said in
Cologne after returning from Armenia.
   Other Red Cross officials said the housing problem is worsening
because temperatures are falling and there is not enough tent space.
   Tass said the Politburo commission adopted a plan for improving
Armenia's railroads to ensure that aid gets to the stricken area.
   Without dramatic improvements in the rail lines that were torn up
by the quake, it said, aid won't reach affected areas fast enough.
   Road, air and rail bottlenecks have slowed movement of relief
supplies to the area in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains in
the Soviet south. Officials from Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov down
have criticized the organization of the early relief work.
   Tass reported that Yazov has called for upgrading civil defense
services in the Soviet Union, incorporating well-trained military
and civilian experts.
   Specialized foreign rescue teams using trained dogs and
sophisticated equipment pulled scores of people from the rubble in
the ruined cities. The Soviet Union did not have any comparable
teams.
   More than 23,000 soldiers were sent to the area to restore
communications and utilities, preserve order, and provide medical
care and food.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia on Friday offered to
send experts to help identify explosives that blew up Pan Am Flight
103 following reports a Czech-manufactured explosive may have been
used.
   A Foreign Ministry statement categorically denied that
Czechoslovakia ever provided explosives to terrorists.
   British authorities said Wednesday that the residue of explosives
recovered from the debris of the Boeing 747 that crashed in
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, was ``consistent with the use of a
high-performance plastic explosive.''
   That led to speculation the bomb may have been made of Semtex, an
orange-colored plastic explosive manufactured in Czechoslovakia.
   Terrorism experts and U.S. State Department officials have said
that Syria and Libya obtained Semtex from Czechoslovakia and passed
it on to surrogate terrorist groups.
   So far, no group or individual has been identified as a prime
suspect in the bombing.
   ``Czechoslovakia again emphasizes that it condemns categorically
all acts, forms and methods of terrorism and that it complies
consistently with the appropriate international commitments,'' said
the Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the state news agency CTK.
   ``It has never supplied and does not supply explosions to
terrorist organizations,'' the statement said.
   CTK said the Ministry issued the statement in response to reports
Semtex may have been used in the Pan Am disaster.
   ``We are ... prepared, should this help the identification of the
explosive used, to send any time Czechoslovak experts for the
appropriate expert consultations,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Slaying of Ecologist Nearly Solved, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal police said Friday they are
close to solving the slaying of an ecologist who angered ranchers by
fighting to protect the vast Amazon jungle.
   ``The murder is still not solved, but the investigation is
heading in the right direction and is close to the end,'' said
police spokesman Paulo Marra in Brasilia.
   Francisco Mendes, 44, was shot to death Dec. 22 outside his home
in the jungle town of Xapuri, 2,660 miles northwest of Rio, near the
Bolivian border.
   Marra said the body was to be exhumed ``so there will be no
doubts when we reach our conclusions.''
   Mendes, honored by the United Nations for his defense of the
environment and his belief that the Amazon jungle could be developed
without being destroyed, had said before his death that big
landowners had made threats against his life.
   Federal agents sent to far-off Acre state to work on the Mendes
case detained five ranchers Thursday for questioning but did not
formally arrest them, Marra said.
   Remaining in custody in Acre were Darcy Pereira da Silva, 21,
Oloci Alves da Silva, 22, and Aleci Alves da Silva, 23, all sons of
ranch owner Darly Alves da Silva.
   Mendes told a Rio newspaper Dec. 9 that Darly da Silva was one of
those who most wanted him killed because of his efforts as an
ecologist and as head of the local Rubber Tree Tappers Union.
   Darcy da Silva said on Tuesday he had killed Mendes. But police
said the confession could have been a smokescreen to protect others.
   The deputy justice minister, Luis Fernando Eichenberg, told the
privately owned Rio station Radio Jornal do Brasil on Friday, ``If
Darcy wasn't the author of the crime _ and it seems he wasn't _
there is some indication he was at the scene.''
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse of rain
forest about two-thirds the size of the continental United States,
has often erupted in violent conflicts between landowners, landless
peasants, politicians, clergymen and ecologists.

<HEAD>Increased Meat Imports Not Expected To Trigger Quotas Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meat imports are not expected to rise enough in
1989 to trigger mandatory quotas on shipments from foreign
suppliers, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Friday.
   The annual estimate is required by law and is subject to revision
every three months during the calendar year. It was the first
estimate for 1989.
   Lyng said a formula in the law calls for maximum imports of
slightly less than 1.438 billion pounds in 1989, down 87.7 million
pounds from the 1988 trigger level.
   But Lyng said total 1989 imports are not expected to exceed 1.425
billion pounds, or about 13 million pounds below the quota trigger.
   The law covers imports of fresh, chilled or frozen meat of
cattle, sheep (except lambs) and goats, and certain prepared and
preserved beef and veal products.
   Most is low-grade beef used to make hamburger and other processed
meat items. Australia and New Zealand are the principal suppliers,
although about a dozen countries are eligible to ship quota-type
meat into the U.S. market.

   China has been authorized to buy an additional
1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Acting Undersecretary Milton J. Hertz said the wheat will be
available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangement, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40 per
ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Under previous EEP authorizations, China has bought more than 6
million tons of wheat for delivery in 1988-89. Only 10,000 tons
remained in the previous authorization issued on Dec. 7.

<HEAD>Alabama County Still Reeling From 1977 Air Force Base Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has been 11 years since Craig Air Force
Base furled its flag in the nation's last round of military-base
closings, a blow the mayor says hurt Selma more than the tumultuous
civil rights era.
   In just one day _ Oct. 1, 1977 _ the city and surrounding Dallas
County lost 2,500 military and civilian jobs, a $40 million payroll
and untold millions in economic spinoffs, the kind of fiscal future
other communities may face under the list of 34 recommended base
closings released Thursday by a government panel.
   Joe Smitherman, mayor of Selma then and now, said Friday that
gains have been made in converting the former flight-training base
to private use. But the mostly black, rural area still has not
recovered, he said.
   ``We haven't got it developed like we hoped it would be. It's
mostly turned into a housing project,'' Smitherman said.
   While the nation remembers Selma for civil rights benchmarks like
the Bloody Sunday clash on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s subsequent voting rights march to
Montgomery in 1965, Smitherman said the loss of Craig was ``the
biggest single impact ... we've had on the area.''
   ``People do adjust to civil rights changes. But it's hard to
adjust to an economic loss like the base,'' he said.
   Hugh Allen, head of the authority that oversees what used to be
the base, said Dallas County's unemployment rate temporarily doubled
to about 20 percent when Craig shut down.
   ``But it was a lot more than that. There was the real estate. And
people who were used to having a lot of military business lost it,''
said Allen.
   State statistics showed Dallas County's unemployment rate at 8.6
percent in 1976, the last full year of record-keeping before the
closing. The rate rose to 9.3 percent in 1979, but that number
reflects only the number of residents seeking employment. Rather
than try to find work in the county, Allen estimates that 3,000 to
3,700 people out of a town of 27,000 simply left.
   In the decade since Craig's closure, local authorities have
fought tooth-and-nail over the field, Smitherman said.
   ``We got word one time that (federal officials) were considering
putting Cuban prisoners out here. We stopped that. The state prison
people were going to put a minimum-security prison out here, and we
stopped that,'' he said.
   What does exist at Craig is a municipal airport, a training
school for state police officers and prison guards, several
companies, warehouses and housing. While as many as 700 people
worked at Craig two years ago, Allen said the recent closing of a
Beechcraft Aircraft plant reduced that number to 275 to 300.
   Of the 500 military housing units on the property, the federal
government controls 50, the Craig Field Airport and Industrial
Authority sold about 50, about 330 are rented and 70 remain vacant,
Allen said.
   Allen had some advice for communities that stand to lose military
facilities under the panel's recommendations:
   ``They need to go after that property. I think you need to plan
your work and then work your plan.''

<HEAD>Criminal Records of 120 Convicted After 1956 Revised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's presidential council Friday
revised the criminal record of 120 people convicted after the 1956
anti-Soviet uprising, the state news agency MTI reported.
   They were among 174 people who were excluded from a broad amnesty
in September for those imprisoned for participating in the revolt.
   The people who were not covered by the amnesty had been told at
that time to sumbit a proposal to the presidential council on
granting individual pardons until Nov. 30, 1988.
   Katalin Gaspar, head of the Justice Ministry's amnesty
department, said Friday that those not granted clemency involved
cases ``when manslaughter was committed ... amid inhuman
circumstances in a dastardly manner, like the killing of wounded
persons,'' MTI reported.
   Clemency was also not granted to those convicted of robbery,
shop-breaking or when ``vengeance motivated the actual or attempted
killing of persons because of their political persuasion or office
held,'' MTI quoted Gaspar as saying.
   He said those not included in the present clemency act can
petition the Justice Ministry again next year.
   According to the amnesty ruling, those convicted for their role
in the 1956 revolt had their criminal record erased. A criminal
record is one reason for denying the issuance of a passport in
Hungary, meaning those granted clemency would likely be permitted to
travel under Hungary's liberalized travel laws.
   The September amnesty covered those sentenced to imprisonment for
crimes against the state, ``counterrevolutionary activities,'' or
persons whose death penalty was commuted to imprisonment.
   The amnesty did not extend, however, to those convicted of high
treason or espionage, or those who, in ``cumulation of offenses,
committed homicide, robbery and caused public danger.''
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a
new government amd demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. On
Nov.4, 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks struck at Budapest to
quell the uprising.

   A New Year's firecracker killed a man
Friday when the rocket he had made exploded, police said.
   Police have seized large amounts of fireworks throughout Italy in
an effort to prevent deaths and injuries.
   Two towns in northern Italy, near Bergamo, have issued decrees
banning traditional year-end celebrations involving the explosives.
   Police said most of the seized fireworks were from Japan and
South Korea.
   Rome police seized 440 pounds of imported firecrackers early
Friday.
   Authorities identified the man who was killed as Giovanni De
Rosa, 28, of Casagiove, near Caserta in southern Italy. The
explosion, outside his home damaged two parked cars and shattered
windows.
   Fireworks are part of Italians' traditional ways to send out the
old year and usher in the new, along with throwing old furniture
from windows and firing guns into the air.

<TEXT>
   As many as 20 infants died after drinking
powdered milk in rural Veracruz state in the last two weeks,
prompting authorities to seize boxes of the milk and test water
supplies, Mexico City newspapers said Friday.
   El Nacional, the government newspaper, said Red Cross and federal
officials began investigating this week after a local newspaper said
20 children had died at a clinic in Perote.
   Perote is 20 miles west of the state capital of Xalapa, where the
first report about the deaths was published in the daily Grafico de
Xalapa. It said the children ranged in age from 18 months to 3
months.
   They died after suffering fever, sharp stomach pains, diarrhea,
vomiting and convulsions, the Mexico City daily El Universal said.
   It said health authorities seized boxes of powdered milk from
local stores and took water samples to check for contamination.
   El Universal said parents were alarmed by the reports, despite
denials by local officials.
   Pedro Coronel Perez, the state health and welfare secretary,
toured the villages of El Conejo, Frijol Colorado, Los Pescadores,
El Limon, Totalco and Escobillo to check the reports.
   Coronel Perez said at least nine infants in the area had died
from intestinal troubles in the past two months. But he said
officials had not determined if their deaths were linked to
contaminated powdered milk.
   He said the infants were from poor, rural families and could have
died from a variety of intestinal illnesses.
   ``They lived in extreme poverty, without proper food and care,''
he said.
   El Nacional quoted Perote Mayor Jaime Roldan Roa as saying that
if there had been contaminated powdered milk in the area, thousands
of children would have died.
   Many people in Mexico drink powdered milk because it is cheaper
and more easily obtained than fresh milk.

<HEAD>Research Shows Not Many Keep New Year's Resolutions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-New Year's Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of more than 200 people studied
failed to keep their New Year's resolutions for a month, and less
than one in five followed their pledges for two years, a researcher
said.
   ``Sticking to your resolution takes more than willpower, it takes
careful planning both before and after the new year,'' said John C.
Norcross, head of the University of Scranton's psychology department.
   Norcross headed a research team that showed only 55 percent of
213 people kept their New Year's resolution for a month. Only 19
percent kept their pledge for two years, he said this week. The
study ran from Jan. 1, 1986, through Jan. 1, 1988.
   People who make New Year's resolutions need to take them
seriously and follow a systematic strategy for keeping them, or not
make them at all, said Norcross, who is also a clinical psychologist.
   ``More than half a million American adults routinely make New
Year's resolutions, and year after year they fail,'' he said. ``Not
because they lack desire. Rather, they are poorly prepared to change
and are under-educated in the complex process of self-change.''
   Norcross suggested several steps before the new year to improve
chances of a resolution succeeding, including:
   _Define an attainable goal.
   _Solicit the cooperation of family and friends.
   _Have a substitute for the behavior to be changed.
   A social worker in Owensboro, Ky., doesn't recommend resolutions
at all.
   ``You're really setting yourself up for a fall with these
things,'' said Tom Mudd, a social worker at Green River
Comprehensive Care Center.
   ``That's because we usually set things up that are way beyond our
reach. I just don't believe in making them at all.''
   The key to keep from giving up and saving yourself from the guilt
that usually accompanies failure, Mudd said, is setting your sights
on one or two small, specific goals and then working on them as soon
as possible.
   Norcross said environmental control, self-reward and willpower
were the keys to self-change.
   ``For example, smokers who want to kick the habit could remove
ashtrays from their home and avoid situations that would tempt them
to smoke,'' he said. ``They also could devise self-rewards, such as
complimenting themselves or treating themselves to a night out for
staying off cigarettes.''
   Norcross said people also should be persistent, even if they slip
along the way. His research showed successful resolvers slipped an
average of 14 times during the two years of the study.
   ``Meaningful behavior change is a lifelong pursuit. It takes the
average smoker five to seven tries to quit for good,'' he said.

^Eds: Inserts 3 grafs after 13th graf, ``He never...' to UPDATE with

<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old boy, using the telephone for
the first time, saved his bleeding mother's life by calling the
operator and asking her to reach his father at work.
   ``The doctors said if I had laid there much longer I wouldn't be
here today,'' Liz Pendleton, 29, said Friday from her hospital room.
   Mrs. Pendleton said she felt sick Tuesday and woke up early
Wednesday in severe pain and unable to move, hemorrhaging from a
ruptured fallopian tube.
   She called to her son, Jason, who was sleeping on the couch near
the telephone and told him he would have to get help.
   ``He told me, `Oh, Mommy, you can just wait until tomorrow to go
to the doctor,''' Mrs. Pendleton said. ``He just couldn't see it.''
   She convinced him she needed help right away, and he followed her
instructions. She made an ``O'' with her thumb and forefinger and
explained where the button for the operator was on the telephone
dial.
   ``Tell her your mama's very sick,'' she told Jason.
   Then Jason told the operator that his daddy worked at Arkla Gas
in the computer room. Mrs. Pendleton told Jason the phone number and
spelled their last name and he repeated it to the operator, she said.
   When the operator got Randy Pendleton, 33, on the line, Jason
said: ``Daddy, mama's very sick. You're going to have to come home.''
   Pendleton called for an ambulance and rushed home. Mrs. Pendleton
was taken to Schumpert Medical Center where she had emergency
surgery. Doctors said she had lost three pints of blood and was near
death.
   Mrs. Pendleton said Jason had never used the telephone before but
handled the situation like a veteran caller.
   ``He knows his numbers. But he's only in 3-year-old preschool,''
she said. ``He catches on real quick. He's 3 but he acts like he's
about 7.
   ``He never got nervous. I was trying not to get him upset. He
took it like a pro,'' his mother said proudly.
   Bonny Baker, the South Central Bell operator who took the call,
said she doesn't often get emergency calls from children.
   ``A lot of times when you do, it's children playing a prank which
at first I thought he was doing,'' Baker said Friday.
   But, she said, it quickly became obvious that the situation was
serious.
   ``You could tell there was definitely something wrong,'' she said.
   Now, Jason's enjoying the attention that comes with heroism.
   ``Yesterday, when the newspaper was up here he was telling them
all about it _ shaking their hands and everything,'' Mrs. Pendleton
said. ``He's going to think his picture should be in the paper every
day.''
   Mrs. Pendleton said she hopes to go home Sunday.

   Masked leftist guerrillas broke into
candlelight dinners at three stylish Lima restaurants, forced
patrons and staff out into the street and then firebombed the
establishments, authorities said Friday.
   The incidents late Thursday night followed a noontime vigil in
which top church and political authorities asked Peruvians to pause
to pray for a peaceful end to insurgency violence, which has claimed
more than 12,000 lives since 1980.
   No one was hurt in the restaurant raids, police said.
   Armed members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, in units
ranging from two to five, simultaneously seized the restaurants;
ordered everyone out and then doused the premises with gasoline and
exploded firebombs.
   Flames heavily damaged Las Trece Monedas, a former colonial home
in downtown Lima converted into a popular tourist restaurant; the
seaside steakhouse Rincon Gaucho, and the suburban restaurant La
Puerta Roja, police said.
   The Tupac Amaru group, active since 1984, endorses a Cuban-styled
Marxism. It is smaller and considered less violent than the Maoist
Shining Path, blamed for most of the insurgency casualties.
Officials say the two groups are not linked.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Accuses Turkey Of Widespread Torture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official has accused
Turkish police of routinely torturing detainees despite government
efforts to polish up Turkey's human rights image, a Dutch newspaper
reported Friday.
   The Rotterdam newspaper NRC Handelsblad said Pieter Kooimans, UN
special rapporteur on human rights, also charged Turkey with
frequently denying suspects legal assistance and keeping them in
total isolation after their arrest.
   Turkey, which has signed several U.N. and European conventions
banning the use of torture, is eager to improve its human rights
reputation after filing an application to join the European Economic
Community.
   The newspaper quoted Kooimans as saying in an interview, however,
that ``in my experience, torture is still being used on a large
scale especially at police stations'' throughout the eastern
Mediterranean nation.
   Kooimans, a Dutch citizen, recently visited Turkish prisons and
police facilities. He said he will discuss his findings in detail in
his annual report to the United Nations Human Rights Commission,
scheduled for publication in early 1989, the paper said.
   Reports of torture by Turkish police and soldiers abounded in the
early 1980s, when Turkey was ruled by a military junta under Gen.
Kenan Evren. Premier Turgut Ozal became head of a civilian
government in 1983. Evren is still president.
   Under Turkey's legal practice, ``Pretrial detention without the
possibility of legal assistance and with the detainees being kept in
total isolation for periods of about two weeks is a virtual
invitation to torture,'' Kooimans was quoted as saying.

6th graf pvs, The Reagan...
^By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that
its chief economic forecasting gauge edged down 0.2 percent in
November, continuing a sawtooth pattern that analysts said portends
a slowdown but no recession in 1989.
   The sluggishness in the department's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators was actually viewed as good news by some experts, who
said it should ease fears that the economy was growing at a pace
threatening new inflation.
   The 0.2 percent November decline was the fourth drop in the past
seven months. Since May, the index has alternated between gains and
declines, showing very little forward momentum.
   The index has risen by just 1.6 percent over the past 12 months,
less than half of the 4.1 percent increase of the previous 12-month
period, suggesting that overall economic growth will slow
significantly in 1989.
   In another signal of slower growth, the government reported
Friday that sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in November, the
biggest decline in 18 months. Analysts blamed the setback, which put
sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671,000 units, on
rising mortgage rates likely to further dampen sales in 1989.
   The last government numbers of 1988 had little or no influence
over the financial markets, which closed out the final trading day
of the year with mixed results in light trading.
   Bond prices rose slightly, the dollar weakened marginally against
key currencies and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.11
points to close at 2,168.57, though advancing issues slightly
outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Reagan administration said the setback in the leading index
was nothing to become alarmed over, showing only that the economy
was slowing a bit. The traditional signal for a recession in the
past has been at least three consecutive monthly declines in the
index.
   ``The data continue to suggest a trend towards slower but
continued economic growth and moderate inflation in the months
ahead,'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk told reporters in Palm
Springs, Calif., where President Reagan is vacationing.
   Private analysts agreed, forecasting that overall economic
growth, as measured by the gross national product, will probably dip
to around 2.5 percent in 1989. That would be down from an expected
growth rate of 3.9 percent in 1988, the economy's best performance
in four years.
   ``We turned in a real strong 1988 despite the drought, but it is
virtually certain that we will see slower growth in 1989,'' said
David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home
Builders.
   Economists said that with many factories producing at near peak
capacity and the unemployment rate near a 14-year low, a slowdown is
needed to dampen inflationary pressures. Most said they saw little
danger that the slowdown would threaten a recession next year.
   ``Because we are still growing at a fairly rapid clip, we can
slow quite a bit before there is a danger of a recession,'' said
Richard Peach, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
``This slowing will be very good news for the economy because it
will remove inflationary pressures.''
   The Federal Reserve has been nudging interest rates up since last
March and analysts said they expected further credit tightening
moves in the early part of 1989 until the central bank becomes
convinced that inflationary forces are under control.
   In November, four of the available nine indicators contributed to
the decline in the leading index, which fell to 193.2 percent of its
1967 base of 100.
   The biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery times on
business orders. This is viewed negatively for the future because it
indicates declining demand for products.
   The other negative factors dragging the index down were a fall in
stock prices, an increase in weekly unemployment claims and a
decline in raw materials prices, also viewed as a negative because
it signals falling demand.
   Three indicators made positive contributions, led by an increase
in growth in the money supply. Other positive forces were a rise in
manufacturing orders for consumer goods and an increase in orders
for new plants and equipment.
   Two indicators, building permits and the length of the average
workweek, were unchanged in November.

<HEAD>Court Calls For More Study Of Offshore Oil Threat To Wildlife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration did not adequately
study the protections needed for migratory wildlife before adopting
a plan last year for offshore oil and gas leasing through 1992, a
federal appeals court ruled Friday.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Interior Department
``failed to perform an adequate analysis of the cumulative impacts
of the program on migratory species.'' It ordered the department to
try again, though the ruling does not immediately impede the leasing
program.
   The wildlife at issue include the gray whale and salmon that
migrate in the north Pacific between California and Alaska, and
various migratory birds.
   The appeals court's unsigned, 64-page opinion rejected all other
aspects of a challenge against the five-year plan adopted by
Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel in July 1987.
   The previous five-year plan survived all court challenges.
   The latest plan was challenged by the National Resources Defense
Council, other environmental groups and the states of California,
Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.
   Leasing activities have not been held in abeyance pending the
legal fight, however, and are not immediately affected by Friday's
ruling. The appeals court ordered the Interior Department to comply
with federal environmental law by providing the required
environmental impact statements on migratory species.
   ``This is a significant victory for the environment,'' said James
Thornton of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.
``It allows the new secretary of Interior and (President-elect) Bush
to look at the entire leasing program and decide whether there
should be a kinder, gentler five-year plan.''
   He said the ruling would carry a profound impact for federal
waters off northern California, Oregon and Washington where as yet
no oil and gas leasing has occurred.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade group, said
it was pleased with the decision: ``It reaffirms what we have long
been saying, that the five-year offshore leasing program does
address adequately and fairly the concerns of state and local
interests.''
   William Bettenberg, associate director of the department's
Minerals Management Service, said he was ``pleased and not very
surprised'' that the department had been largely upheld.
   ``It will be very easy'' to meet the court's requirement in about
two months, he said, since the analysis already has been done for
the various leasing areas individually, and what has to be done is
show the impact, if any, across all areas.
   ``Based on all the research done previously, I'm confident we'll
find no substantial impact'' on migrations, Bettenberg said.
   The first possible lease offering that could be affected is
scheduled in Alaska for December 1989.

<HEAD>Contract That Gave Credit Card Numbers to Inmates Canceled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal contract that gave prisoners
processing mortgage applications access to credit card and bank
account numbers has been canceled.
   ``I can't run the risk. It's just too high a risk,'' Warden
Patrick Kane of the Federal Correctional Institution in Lexington
said Thursday. ``No one in their right mind is going to allow this
stuff in an institution.''
   The U.S. Secret Service is investigating whether any inmates
might have misused the information.
   The contract between the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the prison called for inmates to type information
from completed mortgage applications into computers. Since the work
began as a pilot project in July, more than 60,000 applications have
been sent to the prison.
   About 600 of the applications contained either credit card or
bank account numbers.
   The decision to discontinue the contract between HUD and the
prison was made during a meeting of HUD and Bureau of Prisons
officials in Washington, according to Kane.
   An inmate at the institution, Beverly Hirsch, first sounded the
alarm about the credit card numbers, the Lexington Herald-Leader
reported Friday. Kane said Ms. Hirsch, serving a 40-year sentence
for bank and credit card fraud, told him that some inmates had
copied the credit card numbers and that some of the information had
been passed out of the institution.
   Secret Service agent Bill Cravens of Lexington, who is heading
the investigation, said Friday there was no evidence the information
was being used illegally.
   ``So far as we know now, none of the card numbers have been
compromised,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said the HUD mortgage
applications did not ask applicants for their credit card or bank
account numbers.
   ``Some overzealous lending officers added the information to the
application in an effort to overdocument the applications,'' said
John Pendleton, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman.

<HEAD>Egyptian Paper Accuses Israel; Mubarak: Anti-PLO Group Planned An
Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel on Friday denounced as ``repugnant
libel'' an editorial in an Egyptian government newspaper saying the
Israeli secret service may have been responsible for last week's
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Also Friday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted by a
West German magazine as saying an anti-PLO group ``that may be
working with certain Israeli circles'' planned a large-scale attack
to discredit the Palestinians.
   Mubarak did not identify the group and did not draw any links
between the planned attack and the Dec. 21 bombing of the Pan Am jet
over Scotland.
   In an unsigned editorial Friday, the Egyptian newspaper Al Akhbar
said it was possible Israel's Mossad intelligence service carried
out the Pan Am bombing that killed 270 people.
   The editorial claimed Israel had a ``past record in masterminding
such sort of crimes which aim at casting suspicion on Palestinian or
Arab elements.'' It did not elaborate.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said his government
is ``amazed by the fact that an official Egyptian newspaper has
published an injurious article of this kind.
   ``Israel rejects the repugnant libel ... attributing to Israel, a
victim of PLO aviation terrorism, the same terrorist methods used
against her during the last 25 years,'' Liel said in a statement.
   Mubarak was asked in an interview by the magazine Der Spiegel
what would happen if Arabs opposed to peace in the Middle East
activated terrorists such as Abu Nidal's group.
   ``By Allah, one must reckon with this. Certain groups have surely
hammered out such plans,'' the news weekly quoted Mubarak as saying.
   ``I don't want to name any names, but there is one group that
wanted to let Arafat speak before the U.N. General Assembly ... and
then start a large-scale terrorist action in order to turn public
opinion against the Palestinians,'' Spiegel quoted Mubarak as saying.
   ``These criminal elements that are trying to prevent peace may be
working with certain Israeli circles, I don't know,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   The Spiegel article did not say when and where Mubarak was
interviewed.
   The reports come at a time when Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak
Shamir, is seeking Mubarak's help in launching a new Middle East
peace initiative.
   Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, is the
only Arab nation to maintain diplomatic ties with the Jewish state,
but relations have often been strained.
   Arafat renounced terrorism at a news conference after a speech to
the U.N. General Assembly in mid-December in Geneva. The session was
moved to Geneva after the U.S. State Department refused to issue
Arafat a visa to speak at U.N. headquarters in New York.
   Arafat's statement led to the United States opening a dialogue
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.

<TEXT>
   Thomas C. Blaisdell Jr., recognized as
one of the key designers of the Marshall Plan that restored a
devastated Europe after World War II, has died at the age of 93.
   Blaisdell, who died Tuesday, was a distinguished professor of
political science at the University of California-Berkeley who
continued teaching long after assuming emeritus status in 1963.
   A native of Pittsburgh, Blaisdell joined the administration of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, where he worked on the
Consumer's Council and in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.
   Over the next two decades, he held a number of federal positions,
working first on helping the nation recover from the Depression and
then on European post-war reconstruction.
   Blaisdell was assistant secretary of commerce during the
administration of President Harry S. Truman, and it was from hat
office that he became the man many colleagues described as the
principal designer of the Marshall Plan.
   Blaisdell earned a bachelor's degree at Pennsylvania State
College in 1916. He did postgraduate work at Columbia University,
earning a master's degree in social history in 1922 and a doctorate
in 1932. He taught at Columbia from 1925 to 1932.
   He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1951. A frequent author,
perhaps his best-known work was published in 1976. The book, ``The
American Presidency in Political Cartoons,'' was written with
Berkeley art history professor Peter Selz.
   Blaisdell is survived by a son, Thomas; a brother, William; two
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Writer Whose Trial Marked Crackdown on Dissidents is Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

   Yuli Daniel, a satirist and poet whose 1966 trial
along with Andrei Sinyavsky was a worldwide sensation and marked the
beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents, died at his home
Friday, his former wife said.
   ``He died today about 10 p.m. He suffered a stroke,'' said Larisa
Bogoraz, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movement who was Daniel's
wife when he was sentenced to five years in prison and labor camp
for publishing his works abroad.
   Daniel was 63 years old and had been in ill health for years.
   ``He had suffered several heart attacks in June, then he got
better,'' said Mrs. Bogoraz. ``I saw him the day before yesterday,
but I can't say how he looked.''
   She said he had died at his apartment in Moscow.
   Daniel's most famous work, ``This is Moscow Calling,''
satirically called for a ``Public Murder Day,'' in which Soviets
over the age of 16 would be allowed to kill someone as long as it
was not a policeman or a public transport worker.
   Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness, some of Daniel's works written in
prison camp were published in Moscow in July as he lay in a hospital.
   Daniel and Sinyavsky, conscious of the ostracism of Nobel
Prize-winning author Boris Pasternak for publishing his novel
``Doctor Zhivago'' abroad, used the pseudonyms Nikolai Arzhak and
Abram Terts, respectively, to publish their works abroad.
   Despite persecution of writers such as Pasternak, Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev's years were relatively free for writers, and came to
be known as ``The Thaw.''
   But Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested in the autumn of 1965,
less than a year after Khrushchev was ousted by a group of Kremlin
leaders from which Leonid I. Brezhnev eventually would emerge as the
most powerful.
   Daniel received a five-year term in prison and labor camp for
illegally publishing his works abroad, and Sinyavsky was sentenced
to seven years. It was the first time that criminal charges were
brought against Soviet intellectuals for literary criticism of the
Soviet system.
   Dissidents, KGB secret police and foreign correspondents huddled
outside the Moscow courtroom where they were tried, and rushed to
get word of the proceedings when the defendants' wives would come
out during breaks. News of the trial was broadcast back into the
Soviet Union by foreign radio stations.
   The Kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined
crackdown on dissidents and unofficial publications, but during the
late 1960s unofficial publications and the number of dissidents
nevertheless grew.
   The trial brought Mrs. Bogoraz to prominence. She and others were
arrested in 1968 for a Red Square protest against the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Daniel lived and worked in Kaluga and Moscow after he finished
his term, but did not take part in any further dissident activities.
Sinyavsky emigrated to Paris after serving out his term.
   Ogonyok, in publishing Daniel's prison camp poetry, called him a
``war veteran and man of difficult fate.''
   Included in the poems that were published in July was one called
``The Ring'' in which he appeared to be describing his trial as a
boxing match.
   Mrs. Bogoraz said that Daniel was survived by his wife, Irina
Uvarova, son Alexander and grandson Mikhail.

<HEAD>Pinochet, In Year-end Message, Announces Salary Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a year-end message to the nation
Friday, President Augusto Pinochet announced a 10 percent increase
in the minimum legal salary of $57 a month earned by nearly one
third of Chile's 4 million workers.
   The 73-year-old president and army commander said in a speech
over national radio and TV that a 10 percent wage increase also will
be granted to Chile's 500,000 government workers, with both
increases effective Feb. 1.
   He said the wage increases were made possible by the ``economic
equilibrium and the firm economic growth'' achieved by his
15-year-old military government.
   Pinochet asked Chileans to unite to face ``the important
challenges that we will meet in the new year.''
   He said ``national unity'' is his government's main goal.
   ``Let's set aside those things that separate us,'' Pinochet said.
``Let's firmly fight those who want to destroy our national soul,
and let's form a united front with the single aim of serving Chile
and Chileans, and make of our motherland a great country.''
   Pinochet, who came to power following a 1973 coup, was defeated
in an Oct. 5 referendum in which he sought to remain in power until
1997. As a result, Pinochet was forced to call open presidential and
congressional elections, now scheduled for Dec. 14, 1989.
   He expressed hope that the election will ``consolidate the type
of society'' sought by his government.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Block Likely Saturday Closing Of Miami News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRACY FIELDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday that closing The
Miami News could trigger an antitrust suit if investigators
determine that its owner did not make a serious effort to sell the
newspaper.
   The 92-year-old News is due to close Saturday if a buyer is not
found.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge on Friday dismissed efforts by local
groups trying to force the News to stay open, saying the government
could not compel a newspaper to publish.
   The News is owned by Cox Enterprises Inc. and since 1966 has been
published under a joint operating agreement between Cox and
Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the rival Miami Herald.
   Cox had been conducting sale negotiations with a Chicago
consultant representing a group of investors, but David Easterly,
who heads Atlanta-based Cox's newspaper division, said Friday no
deal was made.
   ``It's over,'' Easterly said.
   In the newsroom, News staffers were cleaning out desks while
keeping ears open for the latest efforts to halt the closing.
   ``It's been real stressful,'' said Bonnie Anderson, a former
NBC-TV foreign correspondent who became a News columnist 15 months
ago. ``This is a very dignified 92-year-old woman and she deserves
to die with some honor, not to keep her on life-support systems.''
   Many staffers planned to gather in the early morning hours
Saturday for the final press run.
   In Washington, the Justice Department found that an amendment to
the joint operating agreement allowing Cox to share Herald profits
even if the News is shut down means the deal ``would likely lose its
antitrust immunity,'' said Charles F. Rule, head of the antitrust
division.
   ``That amendment would make it financially beneficial to both
parties if the News goes out of business,'' Rule wrote. ``Therefore
the investigation deals not only with how vigorous a search was made
for potential buyers by Cox, but how seriously negotiations were
conducted once a potential buyer was found.
   ``A conclusion that serious efforts by Cox would have resulted in
the sale of The Miami News could provide the basis for an antitrust
suit,'' his memo said.
   Knight-Ridder officials said they were studying Rule's memo.
   ``We and our lawyers are reviewing it and we have no comment at
the moment,'' said James K. Batten, president and chief executive
officer of Knight-Ridder.
   Easterly refused to comment on Rule's statement, saying only,
``Press releases are not law.''
   Easterly was attending a hearing in Miami on the federal suit
filed by officials from a dozen community newspapers who claim
closing the News will result in a monopoly for the Herald. The
plaintiffs included readers and distributors of the News.
   After the two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus
rejected their arguments.
   ``The question is whether the government has the power to compel
a newspaper to publish if it wishes to be silent,'' Marcus said,
ruling that he had no such right. He also questioned whether the
plaintiffs could show they stood to lose because of the sale.
   Negotiations for the paper's sale snagged earlier in the week
when Easterly rejected the investors' proposal that Cox support the
paper's losses for six weeks while the potential buyers obtained a
loan.

   A Pentagon review of 17 accidental deaths in
Navy training over the past two years said the service was trying to
improve its safety record, but a Wisconsin congressman called the
report an ``insult'' and accused the Navy of stonewalling.
   ``If this wasn't so serious, it would be a joke,'' said Rep. Toby
Roth, R-Wis. Roth took interest in the issue after the death of a
constituent, Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   A Navy swimming instructor at the training base in Pensacola,
Fla., was convicted of negligent homicide last September in the
Mirecki case and sentenced to 90 days in jail.
   ``In Wisconsin, if you hit a parked car you get more of a penalty
than that,'' Roth said in a telephone interview Friday. ``This death
could have been prevented. It was negiligence. Things got out of
hand.''
   The paragraph dealing with Mirecki in the 10-page Pentagon report
said the only action taken had been review of training courses ``to
ensure maximum safety of students while retaining required realism.''
   The court record showed Mirecki had been dunked repeatedly while
other recruits were forced to stand with their hands against the
wall singing the national anthem.
   In a letter attached to the report, Assistant Secretary of
Defense Grant S. Green said ``the personnel casualties we have
suffered in training are few when compared to the number of students
undergoing training.''
   ``That is not to diminish the personal tragedy which is
represented by each training fatality,'' said Green, chief of
personnel for the Pentagon.
   ``Beyond the personal loss, accidents pose the greatest peacetime
threat to our warfighting assets. I assure you that we will continue
to pursue vigorously methods to reduce accident losses to our
personnel and equipment in our training activities,'' Green's letter
said.
   The Pentagon spending bill for the current fiscal year called on
the Navy to report on the training deaths to Congress by Dec. 31.
   ``We had been going around and around with the Navy and never got
answers,'' Roth said. ``I thought there had been some stonewalling.''
   The congressman said that after he met with Green on Friday
morning and complained about the report, ``Green said, `We will
consider this an interim report and we will try to comply''' with a
more complete version later.
   Green could not be reached at his office Friday afternoon.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Cmdr. Mel Sundin, said he was not
familiar with the report, but read a statement: ``A letter
forwarding an interim report on the causes and circumstances of all
deaths of Navy personnel during Navy training since Jan. 1, 1986,
and on actions taken was sent today to the Speaker of the House, the
Hon. James C. Wright, (D-Texas), and the President Pro Tempore of
the Senate, Sen. John C. Stennis,'' D-Miss.
   Lt. Cmdr. C.W. Baumann, a Navy spokesman, said he had not seen
the report and could not comment.
   Spokesmen for Wright and Stennis said the report had not yet
reached their offices.
   Roth said he would raise his complaints shortly after the 100th
Congress convenes next Tuesday. The General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, is due to report on the issue by Feb.
15, Roth said.
   The Navy report listed the deceased trainees and the dates and
causes of death as: Michael J. Gee, Aug. 19, 1988, drowning; Tasene
Epenesa, May 17, 1988, cardiac arrest; John J. Tomlinson, March 14,
1988, hypothermia; Kenneth M. Kundinger, Dec. 15, 1987, cardiac
arrest; Leo P. McSherry, Gregory McMichael, April 15, 1987, air
crash; Herbert E. McLemore, Jan. 31, 1987, overexertion while
suffering from sickle cell trait; Michael P. Thompson, Oct. 22,
1986, air crash; Jesus C. Paredes, Sept. 3, 1986, cardiac arrest;
Peter Martin, June 8, 1986, parachute jump; Frank W. Dahlinger,
Thomas R. Washington, April, 18, 1986, air crash; Sherwood Collins,
Don L. Bohorques, March 16, 1986, air crash; James B. Friend, March
26, 1986, overexertion while suffering from sickle cell trait; Alan
J. Higgins, Feb. 24, 1986, arrythmia.

<TEXT>
   Anti-government protesters took to the
streets of Khartoum and other cities in Sudan for a fourth day
Friday despite government concessions on food price increases. At
least two people were reported killed.
   A Western diplomat reported rumors of an imminent coup attempt in
Sudan and said the East African country remained paralyzed by a
general strike. Communications were still disrupted.
   Khartoum Commissioner Fatih Abdoun, the capital's head of
government, told Associated Press reporter Mohamed Osman that ``an
unidentified gunman opened fire on demonstrators'' outside Cabinet
offices on Thursday, killing two and wounding 28.
   Osman, speaking by radio from Khartoum, also reported one dead
and 21 injured, including some victims from outside Khartoum in
eastern Sudan. It was not known whether the victims were included in
the previous report.
   Dispatches received in Cairo from the Egyptian and Iraqi news
agencies on Thursday reported what appeared to be two separate
shooting incidents, including one after dark with ``intensive
shooting'' near government headquarters.
   There were no reports of new violence Friday. But a Western
diplomat in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, reported ``complete
political chaos'' in Sudan.
   The diplomat, who watches Sudanese affairs and said he was in
contact with Khartoum, said the disturbances ``do not seem to have
subsided, despite the fact that the price increases which originally
sparked the trouble have been rolled back.''
   ``The action in the streets is taking on a definite
anti-government flavor,'' he said. ``It looks like the government is
in serious trouble. There's a lot of talk about a coup attempt
coming out of Khartoum.''
   Thousands of Sudanese began demonstrations and strikes Tuesday, a
day after the government increased prices of prime commodities by up
to 600 percent and imposed a 15 percent sales tax on all goods.
   On Thursday, in response to a call by the 2-million-member Sudan
Workers' Trade Union Federation, a general strike closed most
businesses and shut down communications and transportation
facilities.
   The government rescinded the price increases on Thursday, but it
was not known whether the tax also was eliminated.
   Officials in Cairo reported the first apparent loosening of the
general strike's grip on the country. Khartoum International Airport
sent a notice to area airports that it was back in business for the
first time since late Wednesday.
   But the national airline Sudan Airways' scheduled service to
Khartoum from Cairo was canceled Friday night because airline
employees remained on strike.
   The diplomat in Addis Ababa said Sudan still suffers from a
``complete paralyzation of transport, communications and everyday
life. ... The railway is down. Inter- and inner-city buses have
stopped rolling. Shops are closed.''
   It appeared that since the government backed down on the price
increases, anger has turned to Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's refusal
to submit to the government and Parliament a tentative agreement to
end the country's 5{-year-old civil war.
   The head of the Democratic Unionist Party, junior partner in the
governing coalition, negotiated the pact with John Garang, a
renegade army colonel who heads the rebels in southern Sudan.
   The agreement called for a cease-fire and suspension of Islamic
law in Sudan until the matter can be discussed in a constitutional
conference, a major concession for Garang. He had vowed that his
mainly Christian and animist forces would continue to fight until
the Islam-based legal code was abrogated.
   Mahdi reportedly was concerned that endorsing the Islamic law
clause would prompt the fundamentalist National Islamic Front to
leave the government, removing a buffer that the prime minister has
used in disputes with the Democratic Unionists.
   Since the street protests began, the Democratic Unionists, who
dominate the trade union federation, have quit the government in
sympathy.
   Reports on Friday said Mahdi has accepted the six Unionist
ministers' resignations and will name Hassan Turabi, his
brother-in-law and attorney-general, to the key Unionist-held post
of foreign minister.
   That would make Turabi the government's peace negotiator with
Garang. As attorney-general Turabi drafted the Islamic legal code,
and as head of the Islamic Front he has spearheaded opposition to
the Unionist-negotiated agreement, so prospects for successfully
concluded talks would be virtually nil.

<HEAD>Protesters Hang Banner on Communist Party Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two opposition activists on Friday hung a
protest banner reading ``Free the Politicals'' from a balcony at the
headquarters of the Community Party's Central Committee in the
capital.
   The banner was signed with the initials of the banned Polish
Socialist Party and the Warsaw regional council of the Solidarity
trade union movement.
   The protest was connected with a weeklong hunger protest taking
place in Warsaw through Sunday to draw attention to the detention of
anti-military activists in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   Brief displays of opposition banners from public buildings are
fairly common in Poland. However, this appeared to be the first time
activists managed to place one on the guarded headquarters of the
Communist Party.
   Security workers seized the 15-foot-long banner after about five
minutes. The activists, Piotr Ikonowicz and Edward Mizikowski, were
led away into the building and detained, according to Jozef Pinior,
a Socialist Party spokesman.
   Authorities meanwhile freed a secret policeman Friday who was
sentenced to prison for helping underground members of Solidarity,
prison officials and opposition sources said.
   Adam Hodysz, 48, was arrested in 1984 and initially charged with
cooperating with Solidarity's underground. Authorities later
sentenced him to six years in prison on a more serious charge of
corruption, alleging he had taken money to pass police secrets to
Solidarity.
   Solidarity activists have denied any financial motive for
Hodysz's cooperation. They say he was motivated by sympathy for the
union movement, which authorities crushed in late 1981 and banned in
1982.
   Hodysz, a former captain in the state Security Service in Gdansk,
was released from a prison in Koszalin, in northwestern Poland,
according to a duty officer at the Regional Board of Penitentiaries.
The official refused to give his name.
   The former policeman was eligible for the parole, subject to good
behavior, because he had served two-thirds of his prison sentence.
   After his release, Hodysz went to St. Brygida's Church in Gdansk,
a northern port, to meet with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the
Rev. Henryk Jankowski, according to a Jankowski aide. Jankowski is a
Walesa adviser.
   At the time of Hodysz's arrest, authorities were trying to stamp
out any vestige of Solidarity, the first independent labor movement
in the East bloc. However, they have increasingly tolerated the
movement in recent years and even allowed Walesa to speak in an
uncensored television debate in November.

   Roman Catholic leaders announced the
selection of conservative Georg Eder as Salzburg's new archbishop
Friday but complained of bias in the Vatican's list of candidates
for the post.
   In an official statement carried by the Catholic news agency
Kathpress, the 12-member Salzburg Cathedral Chapter said Eder
accepted the body's appointment Thursday. It must now be formally
made by Pope John Paul II.
   The announcement comes at a time when the Catholic Church in
Austria is suffering from widening divisions over the appointment of
conservative bishops and with contentious issues, including the
pope's stand on birth control and women's role in the Church.
   Eder is known as a conservative priest who says Mass in Latin
with his back to the congregation. The Second Vatican Council in the
1960s called for use of a new Mass in the vernacular with the priest
facing the faithful.
   The Salzburg chapter said it broke the traditional secrecy
surrounding such appointments because of advance media criticism of
the choice of yet another conservative for a top church post. Eder
was considered by commentators as the least conservative of three
candidates put forward for selection by local church leaders.
   An estimated 260,000 believers have left the church in the past
eight years. According to a critical Catholic journal, 30,917 left
the church in 1987 alone.
   The local church leaders also criticized the Vatican's three
candidates, saying the list was biased.
   ``The Cathedral Chapter had to recognize that the selection of
candidates for this triple proposal was not taken in such a balanced
fashion as could be expected,'' they said in a joint statement.
   The statement said they had ``exhausted every available
possibility'' to make the Vatican aware of ``the needs of the
diocese and the views of the area.'' They said they had sent a
letter on the issue to the Vatican.
   The appointments of conservative Hans Hermann Groer as archbishop
of Vienna in September 1986 and of ultra-conservative Kurt Krenn as
assistant bishop of Vienna five months later triggered open protest
and division in Austria's Catholic ranks.
   In the Vatican City on Friday, the pope nominated five new
auxiliary bishops in Hungary and another in the tiny central African
country of Rwanda.
   The pope nominated the Revs. Vilmos Dekany and Asztrik Varszeghi
to posts in Esztergom; the Rev. Istvan Acs in Eger; the Rev. Mihaly
Mayer in Pecs; the Rev. Nandor Takacs in Szekesfehervar; and the
Rev. Felicien Muvara in Butare, Rwanda.

   Dynamite exploded early Friday at a
nightclub popular with U.S. sailors, but the building was empty at
the time and no one was hurt, police reported.
   The blast occurred at 6:30 a.m. at the nightclub Big in the town
of Palau, near the U.S. military base at La Maddalena.
   Authorities said, however, that the explosion did not appear
aimed at the Americans. It apparently was a protest of the noisiness
of the club, said a police officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The dynamite, placed at the entrance to the club, shattered
windows and bottles of liquor and damaged the furniture.
   Sardinia had planned a non-binding referendum for April on
whether residents of the island were in favor of foreign military
bases not approved by Parliament which service nuclear-powered
vessels or those carrying nuclear arms.
   The only base that fit the description was the one at La
Maddalena. However, Italy's Constitutional Court suspended the April
vote.
   The Italian-American agreement, which allowed construction of the
base on the Mediterranean island off the Italian mainland in 1972,
was never ratified by Italy's Parliament.
   In Washington, U.S. Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. C.W. Baumann said
shore leaves remained the same for sailors in the region following
the bombing.

   A stagehands strike forced cancellation of the
National Ballet of Canada's last sold-out holiday performances this
year of ``The Nutcracker,'' officials said Friday.
   Four matinee and evening performances of the traditional ballet
and one of the farcical ``Nutty Nutcracker'' were canceled from
Thursday to Saturday.
   ``The union refuses to put stagehands on the job while mediation
talks are in session,'' Charles Cutts, general manager of the
O'Keefe Center, said in a statement.
   The O'Keefe's theater seats 3,000. The National Ballet has been
performing the holiday favorite annually since 1964.
   The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees' local
and the center are in a dispute over use of outside technical
workers by touring productions.
   ``The Sugar Plum Fairy was felled by a labor dispute last
night,'' the Toronto Star wrote Friday in reporting on the strike.

   A federal judge refused Friday to block police from
arresting homeless people in pre-Orange Bowl weekend roundups,
denying an injunction sought by the American Civil Liberties Union.
   The ACLU accused Miami police of harassing the homeless in
advance of the Orange Bowl Parade on Saturday in an effort to make
the city look clean for tourists and national television audiences.
   ``When someone is sleeping on a piece of cardboard, they can be
arrested for littering,'' said ACLU attorney Valerie Jonas, seeking
a ban on enforcing misdemeanor laws she said were used selectively
to round up the poor and homeless.
   U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins ruled on technical grounds,
said Assistant City Attorney Leon Firtel, who added the decision
probably did not allow time for an appeal before the weekend.
   ``The police are not restrained from enforcing the law, which is
all that the city asked,'' said Firtel, who argued against the ACLU
in court. ``The police are going to do their duty and follow the
law. If they have probable cause to arrest someone, they will go
ahead and do that.''
   Brother Paul Johnson, director of the private Camillus House
homeless shelter, says at any given time there are 10,000 homeless
people in Miami. The city offers no public shelters.
   ``We're going to have observers out in the streets tonight to
make sure nothing happens _ and if these sweeps continue we're going
to observe them,'' said Ben Waxman, another ACLU attorney.
   Waxman said the ACLU lost the fight for a preliminary injunction,
but he will continue to press the underlying class-action lawsuit on
behalf of the homeless.
   ``We're still convinced that the misconduct occurred and the
homeless are being discriminated against,'' he said.

   Israel's members of Parliament suffer from
headaches you don't get from guerrilla infiltrators, hostile Arab
neighbors, or even a Palestinian uprising.
   No, they have some real headaches: the kind that make your
temples throb, turn your brain to porridge, and transform a
political speech into medieval torture.
   Lawmakers blame the endemic headaches on their 22-year-old
Parliament building, whose poor ventilation and air conditioning
have earned it the nickname ``The Submarine.'' Doctors, in turn,
dubbed the lawmakers' physical complaints ``The Submarine Syndrome.''
   Parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky said Friday the problem has ``a
great influence'' on legislators' ability to function.
   ``This is not a joke; it is a serious problem. I know a lot of
legislators who suffer from headaches and dizziness,'' Shilansky
said on Israel army radio.
   Asked if this was why many of the 120 legislators often look
sleepy, Shilansky said: ``It's really hard to sit here for the whole
day. If you spend a whole day here, you leave with a headache.''
   The five-story Parliament building on a hilltop in central
Jerusalem was inaugurated in 1966. The two lower floors, including
parts of the main auditorium, are partly underground.
   The Submarine Syndrome can do more than give you a pounding
headache, said Shilansky, a member of the Likud bloc.
   ``When I was a new Knesset (parliament) member, I met a man who
told me that he was a Knesset worker, had a good job, and was happy
with it. But he resigned because of poor ventilation. He said a
doctor told him: `You have a choice between shortening your life or
resigning,''' he said.
   Raanan Cohen, a freshman legislator from the Labor Party, said he
has begun to suffer frequent headaches since the 12th Knesset opened
Nov. 21.
   ``Normally, I don't have headaches, and I think there's some
problem with the building,'' Cohen said.
   Throughout the building, it's either too hot or too cold, said
maintenance manager Shmaryahu Eckhaus.
   ``If we heat the first floor where people complain of cold, the
heat spreads to the second and third floors, and people there ...
feel suffocated by the heat. If we turn down the heat, people on the
first floor complain of cold,'' he said.
   Experts say the solution is to break down the air-conditioning
system into smaller systems with individual controls in different
parts of the building. But army radio said that answer is too
expensive.
   Parliament doctors advise legislators to walk outside from time
to time for a breath of fresh air, the radio said.
   But legislators cannot always heed that advice during long
debates that often deteriorate into shouting matches _ especially
unbearable to people suffering from headaches.

<TEXT>
   A military court on Friday ordered the
arrest of 20 members of a military-police task force implicated in
the massacre of 14 Venezuelan fishermen in October.
   ``There was no armed confrontation, but the loss of 14 innocent
lives,'' said Gen. Angel Zambrano, who overruled a lower military
court decision in November that the task force acted in ``legitimate
self-defense.''
   Zambrano presided over a War Council, the highest regional
military court, in San Cristobal, about 400 miles southwest of
Caracas.
   He ordered the arrest of the 20 Venezuelans _ 16 members of
special police forces and four members of the armed forces _ and a
Colombian man believed to be an informant for the brigade.
   Military spokesmen originally said the 14 men killed were
Colombian guerrillas shot in an Oct. 29 firefight with government
forces out to prevent them from blowing up oil installations along
the Colombian-Venezuelan border.
   But two survivors who jumped into a river and swam for their
lives denied those shot were guerrillas and said they were all
fishermen out on a picnic.
   A major factor in the military's reversal was evidence released
publicly, although never made official, that an exhumation of the 14
bodies showed most of the men were shot either in the back or in the
head at close range.
   The case attracted international attention. Government officials
received letters from human rights and church groups around the
world demanding justice.
   Townspeople of El Amparo, near the site of the massacre, backed
up the two survivors' claims in interviews with journalists.
   The two survivors, Wolmer Pinilla and Jose Arias, later sought
asylum in Mexico rather than face the military court for trial on
charges of ``military rebellion'' based on the official version of
events.

   Troops raided a Gaza Strip hideout and killed
two Palestinians who tried to flee, and a third Arab was killed
Friday when soldiers fired at stone-throwing worshipers after Moslem
prayers, the army said.
   At least 10 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli
troops in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said. An army
spokesman confirmed four wounded.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir plans to launch a peace initiative
within two months and will seek Egypt's help in finding Palestinian
negotiators who are not tied to the PLO, said Shamir aide Avi Pazner.
   The worst clashes erupted in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in
Gaza City when dozens of people took to the streets after prayers at
the local mosque, the army and Arab reports said.
   ``After prayers, they raised the Palestinian flag and threw
stones,'' said an army spokesman. Arab reporters said soldiers used
clubs, rubber bullets and live ammunition to break up the protest.
   The army said troops killed one protester and wounded four.
   The dead man, Abdel Khalim Behid, 22, was shot during the
disturbance and died at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, hospital
officials said. They put the number of wounded at six, and said a
4-year-old boy was hit in the head with a rubber bullet.
   Elsewhere in Gaza City, three Palestinians were wounded, Arab
doctors said. In the nearby Jabalya refugee camp, a teen-ager was
wounded.
   Late Thursday, troops tried to arrest three suspected firebomb
throwers who reportedly were hiding in a home in Gaza City's Zeitoun
neighborhood, the army said.
   ``Soldiers shouted for them to come out,'' the army spokesman
said. ``They tried to escape and were shot.''
   One man died at the scene, and the second at an Israeli hospital.
A third Palestinian was captured unharmed.
   The deaths late Thursday and Friday brought to 342 the number of
Palestinians killed in their yearlong rebellion against the Israeli
occupation. Fourteen Israelis also have died.
   The army, meanwhile, brought reinforcements to the occupied lands
in anticipation of increased violence on Jan. 1, known to
Palestinians as ``Fatah Day,'' Israel radio said.
   On that day in 1965, the mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO led
by Yasser Arafat launched its first attack against Israel.
   Along with increased troops, the West Bank's military government
ordered a week-long closure of all Palestinian schools, beginning
Saturday. The measure affects 300,000 students.
   Israeli officials consider Palestinian schools flashpoints of
violence, and West Bank schools were closed by the military
government for most of the period from February to December.
   Shamir, meanwhile, was quoted as saying Friday that his peace
initiative would be based on the 1978 Camp David accords, which call
for talks on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied lands preceding a
final settlement of the conflict.
   According to the Haaretz newspaper, Shamir said he would not
insist that the U.S.-brokered agreement between Israel and Egypt be
followed to the letter.
   ``It is also possible to speak to others,'' he was quoted as
saying, referring to Palestinian representation in peace talks.
   Pazner said Shamir envisioned ``a major role'' for Egypt in
helping find Palestinians acceptable to Israel, which has refused to
negotiate with the PLO. Israel refused to negotiate with the PLO.
   Arafat, who heads the PLO's mainstream Fatah faction, said
earlier this month that he recognized Israel and renounced terror,
and in return the United States reversed a longstanding policy and
opened talks with the PLO.
   In the Haaretz interview, Shamir reiterated his opposition to an
international peace conference under U.N. auspices, as demanded by
the PLO and most Arab nations.
   Shamir said he would accept direct talks under the sponsorship of
the United States and the Soviet Union, but said they should be
restricted to a ceremonial role ``to give international legitimacy
to direct talks.''
   Asked how he would respond if President-elect George Bush invited
him to an international conference with PLO participation, Shamir
said: ``I would notify him that I could not come.''
   Lebanon's acting prime minister meanwhile instructed his
country's U.N. ambassador, Rashid Fakhoury, to protest an Israeli
air raid on south Lebanon Thursday that wounded eight Shiite Moslem
militiamen.
   Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, told Fakhoury to ``lodge an urgent, strongly worded
complaint about Israel's latest aggression.''
   The raid by two helicopter gunships nine miles north of the
Israeli border was Israel's 25th in Lebanon this year.

<TEXT>
   The Pittsburgh Press and its unions agreed
Friday to continue talks beyond the expiration of contracts at
midnight Saturday, averting a holiday weekend strike at the Press
and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
   The unions charged Friday that the Pittsburgh Press Co., which
publishes both newspapers under a joint operating agreement, would
use a strike as an excuse to close the Post-Gazette and give the
morning newspaper market to the larger Press.
   Pittsburgh Press Co. accepted a late offer by 10 unions
representing about 1,400 non-editorial workers to continue
operations under current contract language on 48 hours' notice of a
strike ``so long as good-faith negotiations continue.''
   The company earlier this week had offered a 30-day extension of
current contracts. Company spokesman Randall P. Notter said no
negotiations would be held until next week.
   Pittsburgh Press Co. publishes the afternoon Press and morning
Post-Gazette under a 1961 joint operating agreement allowing
independent editorial staffs but shared advertising, printing and
circulation departments.
   The union's offer came after both newspapers vowed Friday to
continue to publish daily if their joint operating company was
struck at midnight Saturday.
   Joe Pass, attorney for Teamsters Local 211, the largest of the 10
unions, charged it was ``obvious and self-evident that the plan of
The Pittsburgh Press is to force a strike.''
   Pass said the Press, owned by Scripps Howard Newspapers, would
``buy out'' Post-Gazette Publisher William Block for the remaining
years of the joint operating agreement, which continues until Dec.
31, 1999.
   The Pittsburgh Press Co. said the Post-Gazette's ``existence is
assured'' through the joint operating agreement and the newspaper
``is not an issue in these negotiations.''
   Pass said the two sides differ on company proposals to ``change
(working) conditions and practices that have gone on for 50 years.''
He said the proposals involved work rules and job security issues.
   The Teamsters local represents 442 drivers and mechanics and 238
circulation employees.
   The company's other unionized employees include more than 400
composing room, financial and advertising workers represented by
Pittsburgh Typographers Union Local 7, 180 members of Mailers Union
Local 22, and 155 members of Graphic Communications International
Union Pressmen Local 9. Other union employees who are negotiating
include photo engravers, electricians, machinists, paperhandlers,
janitors and engineers.
   The Press has an average paid circulation of 229,539 daily and
554,685 on Sunday, and the Post-Gazette has an average paid
circulation of 168,123 daily, except Sunday, according to the
Post-Gazette.
   Post-Gazette editors and reporters, who are members of Newspaper
Guild Local 61, are working under a three-year contract that expires
Dec. 31, 1990. Press editors and reporters are not unionized.

<HEAD>West German Officer Wants to Break Free of U.S. Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential West German admiral
wrote in a magazine article that West Germany should stop acting as
Washington's ``model boy,'' support abolishment of short-range
nuclear arms, and seek peace with Moscow.
   In an article written for this week's edition of Stern weekly
magazine, Adm. Elmar Schmaeling promoted policies he said would lead
to withdrawal of foreign troops from West Germany and other European
countries.
   About 400,000 foreign troops, including 250,000 from the United
States, are stationed on West German territory. A spate of crashes
of NATO warplanes this year has heightened public controversy over
the troops.
   Schmaeling serves as chief of the West German armed forces'
Office for Studies and Exercises, a think tank.
   He has made comments in the past similar to those in the Stern
article.
   He wrote in Stern that it was time to ``re-examine the
foundations of our postwar policies'' because of changes in the
Soviet bloc.
   He argued that the United States believes eventual conflict with
the Soviet Union is inevitable. In contrast, he wrote, West Germans
want ``to overcome confrontation with the Warsaw Pact.''
   ``The goal is an international system of common security in
Europe,'' he wrote.
   Schmaeling said that ``for too long we have been playing the role
of model boy'' to appear ``reliable, friendly and grateful friends
of the United States.''
   The United States owns the short-range, or tactical, nuclear
weapons stationed in West Germany. The Soviet Union keeps such
weapons in East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   ``Nuclear weapons should be allowed to be stationed only on the
territory of the country that also has them at their disposal,''
Schmaeling wrote.
   He called for pursuit of disarmament policies that would lead to
ending ``the unnatural situation of foreign troops on one's own
territory.''
   ``A speeded-up process of mutual disarmament and the dismantling
also of conventional invasion weapons must lead to military
structures that are purely defensive in all countries.''
   ``When this is mutually done ... military alliances with
integrated forces can be dissolved,'' he wrote.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz and other West German officials
say foreign troops and short-range nuclear weapons are needed here
to offset what they view as a Soviet threat.

   A trucker rammed his tractor-trailer into
more than 20 cars, seriously injuring at least two people, during an
80-mile chase Friday that snarled San Antonio morning rush-hour
traffic, authorities said.
   Stephen Odell Dillard, 41, of Coolidge, Ga., was charged with
possession of cocaine and was held in the Medina County Jail here
under $50,000 bond while authorities in other counties prepared
other charges against him, officials said.
   The chase began shortly after 8 a.m. on Interstate 10 near
Comfort, about 40 miles northwest of San Antonio, said state trooper
Alvin Schacht. The rig, carrying vegetables from California to
Florida, sideswiped a vehicle driven by lawyer Robert Etlinger, who
was run off the road but then pursued the fleeing truck, Schacht
said.
   The trucker ``was running between 85 and 90 and he (Etlinger)
couldn't catch him,'' Schacht said.
   ``He took the whole back end of my station wagon,'' said Donald
Kite, who was driving to work in San Antonio when he saw the truck
come up behind him. ``All of sudden, there was a KA-WHAM, and I
almost started going back under his trailer,'' he said.
   Troopers, police and at least 10 other drivers also pursued the
tractor-trailer before it finally stopped at an Interstate 35 rest
area near Natalia, southwest of San Antonio.
   The driver got out of the cab and citizens surrounded him until
the pursuing officers arrived to make the arrest, said trooper
Marshall Milikien.
   ``I was doing about 85 after him and I was about five car lengths
behind him,'' said Rene Davila, one of the citizens who followed the
trucker and kept him from leaving the rest stop.
   ``They just made sure he didn't run away,'' Milikien said of the
citizens, acknowledging that many sped to chase Dillard.
   ``He didn't say anything,'' said Lytle Police Chief Leo Thormann,
the first officer to arrive. ``To me he didn't appear that he knew
that anything had happened. He was very calm, very cooperative.''
   Troopers said they found 4 to 5 grams of cocaine in the cab, and
that narcotics officers planned to search the cargo. Dillard was
charged with possession of a controlled substance, a felony
punishable by two to 20 years in prison.
   Mary Herrera, 53, and Mercedes Loera, 62, injured when vehicles
were struck, were in serious condition at Wilford Hall Air Force
Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base, said hospital spokeswoman
Lt. Col. Karen Wetzel. She would not release details of their
injuries.

   Canada's Senate on Friday approved a sweeping
agreement that virtually erases trade barriers between Canada and
the United States. The Free Trade Agreement goes into effect on New
Year's Day.
   Furious debate over the pact forced Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
to call new elections on Nov. 21. But the contest gave Mulroney's
Progressive Conservative Party its second straight majority
government and a clear mandate to push for passage of the
legislation.
   The Senate vote in Ottawa was by voice and not tabulated.
Senators from the opposition Liberal Party, which fought the
agreement fiercely during the fall campaign but promised to let it
pass if Mulroney won, abstained.
   Later Friday, Supreme Court Justice Antonio Lamer, acting for
Governor General Jeanne Sauve, gave the bill its final approval.
Such approval by Britain's representative in Canada is a vestige of
colonial times.
   Mulroney issued a New Year's statement Friday celebrating
Canadians' ``historic opportunity to affirm their confidence in our
country's future.''
   He used similar language in his pitch for the free-trade
agreement in the campaign for November elections.
   The pact was approved by the House of Commons during a volatile
session on Dec. 24. The Conservatives used their majority to muscle
the bill through 141-111 while irate opposition lawmakers sang the
national anthem in protest.
   The Liberals control the non-elected Senate and had tied up the
legislation there last fall, forcing Mulroney to call the election.
They promised, however, not to repeat their action if he won a
majority government.
   Even so, they pledged to monitor the trade agreement closely as
its effects begin to be felt in coming years.
   ``Even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become
law, our concerns have not disappeared,'' Allan MacEachen, the
Liberals' leader in the Senate, said during the debate. ``The
government has chosen the hard discipline of the market. We will
have to monitor whether the market does its job.''
   The Liberals hold 59 of the 98 Senate seats, allowing them to set
up a monitoring committee as trade negotiations under the agreement
with the United States get under way.
   The pact was signed Jan. 2, 1988, by President Reagan and
Mulroney, sparking a year of soul-searching by Canadians.
   Many believed the trade pact represented a final subjugation of
the Canadian identity by its rich southern neighbor. But supporters,
especially big business, heralded the agreement as a potential
economic boon that would open up U.S. markets and eliminate $2
billion annually in U.S. tariffs.
   The two nations, with $150 billion in annual trade, already form
the world's biggest two-nation trading partnership. But the trade
agreement now phases out all remaining tariffs, quotas and duties
between them.
   It also dismantles many investment barriers, frees up trade in
energy and services and creates U.S.-Canadian panels to settle
disputes.
   The actual start of the agreement will be low key, with an
exchange of diplomatic notes.
   Special interests on both sides of the border, mainly union and
farm groups, criicized various elements of the legislation because
it would eliminate protectionist rules for specific industries.
   Ontario grape growers, for example, were upset because the pact
would eliminate an automatic 65 percent markup on U.S.-made wine.

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Reactor Restarted After 33 Months Idle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pilgrim nuclear reactor began
low-power testing Friday after receiving final federal clearance
nearly three years after being shut down and labeled one of the
country's worst-run power plants.
   Boston Edison Co., the owner, said the restart began about 6 p.m.
with the withdrawal of control rods in the reactor.
   Opposition to Pilgrim's restart has been intense, with state
officials pledging to do everything they can to keep the plant from
operating and protesters planning to demonstrate at the plant gates
Saturday.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission cleared the way Friday for
low-power testing of the 670-megawatt reactor for up to 5 percent of
its capacity.
   The restart began a test program intended to take the plant
gradually to full power in about four months, said Ralph Bird,
Boston Edison senior vice president for nuclear power.
   Bird said the utility would continue to work with state and local
officials to complete and improve an emergency evacuation plan for
towns around the plant. State officials have called the plan
inadequate despite revisions, and they also say the plant should not
reopen until a study of leukemia rates in the population surrounding
the plant is complete.
   ``We will do whatever we possibly can legally, through the
attorney general, to ensure that the plant doesn't operate,'' said
Martie Barnes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. ``We still
believe the plant is not ready for restart.''
   At the time Pilgrim was shut in April 1986, the NRC called the
plant ``one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the country.
   Boston Edison has spent about $200 million since the shutdown to
replace nearly all of the plant's top management, work on mechanical
problems and fight skepticism by the NRC and a growing anti-nuclear
movement among nearby residents.
   If the plant's restart schedule is followed, consumers can
receive power from Pilgrim when it hits 10 percent operating
capacity sometime next month.
   By the end of January, the plant should be at about 25 percent of
power, producing 100 megawatts daily, or enough electricity to power
160,000 homes, Boston Edison spokeswoman Elaine Robinson said.
   Massachusetts Citizens for Safe Energy, an anti-nuclear group,
Friday called the reopening ``a slap in the face to local and state
government officials and a direct threat to thousands of people
living near the Pilgrim nuclear plant.''
   ``There are increasing signs that Pilgrim has caused leukemia in
nearby residents,'' the group said in a statement.
   Boston Edison officials said there is no evidence that radiation
from the plant has caused any cancer deaths.
   Citizens for Safe Energy also said the plant should not be
brought to full power because ``Pilgrim's history of management and
safety failures has continued despite NRC and Edison claims to the
contrary.''
   Said Robinson: ``We're confident that we're proceeding in a very
safe and responsible manner and we wouldn't procede if we didn't
think it was safe. It's important to realize how many of us live
right here with our families.''
   In October 1987, Dukakis and Attorney General James Shannon,
citing evacuation and safety concerns, asked the NRC to revoke
Pilgrim's operating license.
   That request was formally denied Thursday in a letter from Thomas
E. Murley, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation.
   In a letter dated Friday, NRC Regional Administrator William T.
Russell gave permission for the plant to operate, saying the
technical issues raised in the shutdown had been resolved.
   The Pilgrim plant must undergo another review by the NRC before
it is granted permission to operate at full power, a process that
could take months.

   A fiery chain-reaction crash that
killed four people and injured 10 others took place at the same
intersection where two fatal accidents occurred five years ago.
   A truck driven by Richard Hall, 37, of Warrenville, S.C., plowed
into a line of cars Thursday night at a stoplight at the
intersection of the Edens Expressway, also called U.S. 41, and
Clavey Road, about 25 miles north of Chicago, causing the crash and
a series of explosions, authorities said.
   ``Apparently ... the (truck) driver had been driving too many
hours and fell asleep,'' said Master Sgt. Jerry Bresnahan of the
Illinois State Police. ``I guess when you're on an interstate like
that, you don't expect to come to a stoplight.''
   Just after the light turned green, Hall's truck smashed into a
car, killing the two men and two women inside, Bresnahan said. The
car hit by the truck then smashed into others, a chain reaction that
involved seven cars in two lanes, he said.
   The identities of the four dead were not released Friday
afternoon. Hall was in good condition at Highland Park Hospital,
suffering from abdominal pain, said hospital spokesman Charles Block.
   Block said another crash victim, Marvin Whittaker, 44, of Zion,
Ill., was in fair condition with a rib fracture. Eight other people
were treated at the hospital and released, Block said.
   No charges had been filed in the case, Bresnahan said.
   State Department of Transportation figures show that at least 509
accidents have occurred at the intersection since 1976. In 1983, two
fatal accidents that left four people dead spurred lawmakers to
press for the construction of an overpass.
   ``I think it can be characterized as the most dangerous
intersection in Illinois,'' said Daniel Pierce, mayor of this
suburban town.
   The mayor added, ``I don't know how many deaths we have to have
there before the state thinks it's a dangerous intersection.''
   Charles McLean, an operations engineer for the state
transportation department, said the 45 accidents at the intersection
in 1987 ranked it sixth in Lake County and 25th in the Chicago
metropolitan area.
   ``In terms of the number of accidents (the intersection) doesn't
rank high. It's just the type of accident,'' he said.
   He said the department had been planning the $8.5 million
overpass since 1983, and that construction should begin next fall
and be completed in late 1990.
   But the lengthy process was costly, Pierce said.
   ``Finally it's going through, but not in time to save the lives
of those people,'' he said.

   A cold front crossing the Northwest brought rain and gales to the
coastal areas and snow to higher elevations Friday, while showers
ranged from east Texas through the lower Mississippi Valley to the
Carolinas.
   Snow has been falling across northern sections of the Sacramento
Valley, and up to a foot of snow was possible through Friday night
high in the Sierra Nevada range of Northern California and the Lake
Tahoe area of Nevada.
   Gale warnings were set for coastal Oregon and Northern
California, and a snow advisory remained in effect Friday for the
mountains of Idaho, the Cascades of Washington and Oregon, and the
Siskiyou mountains of Oregon.
   A snow advisory has been posted through Saturday for northwestern
Wyoming. Winter storm watches have been posted through Saturday for
central Montana.
   Rain developing north of a warm front over the Gulf of Mexico
extended from eastern Texas through much of the lower Mississippi
Valley to western parts of the Carolinas on Friday afternoon.
   Fog continued to shroud parts of Florida and the Gulf Coast
Friday afternoon, with advisories for dense fog posted for
southwestern Louisiana and the coastal bend area of Texas.
   Light snow fell on parts of North Dakota, northern Minnesota and
Upper Michigan, with Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., receiving 2 inches of
snow during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   Sunny skies prevailed from the southwestern Deserts, across much
of the southern and central Plains and across the Northeastern
states.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from zero
degrees at Fargo, N.D., to 84 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla. The low
for the nation Friday was 19 degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine.
   The national forecast for Saturday called for rain on the
northern and central Pacific Coast, with scattered showers over
Southern California. Snow will prevail from the coastal mountain
ranges to the northern High Plains, with heavy snow expected in
higher elevations.
   Snow showers will be scattered across the North Central and
Northeast states, with snow likely over northern Maine.
   Rain will extend from the western and central Gulf Coast to the
Carolinas and the mid-Atlantic Coast, with thunderstorms over the
central Gulf. Rain will be most likely from Louisiana to Tennessee
and the Carolinas. Fair to partly sunny skies will prevail over the
rest of the nation.
   Temperatures will remain freezing all day over the northern and
central Rockies, and from the northern High Plains through the Great
Lakes region to northern New England, with highs in the teens from
northern Montana to upper Michigan, and across northern Maine.
   Temperatures will warm into the 50s and 60s from the southern and
central coast of California to southern Arizona, and from the
southern High Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast. Temperatures
will warm into the 70s in the lower Rio Grande valley of Texas and
will reach the 70s and lower 80s across the Florida Peninsula.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush departed Friday for a long
holiday weekend at Camp David, Md., after receiving a court subpoena
that could force him to disclose information on the Iran-Contra
affair that he previously has refused to divulge.
   Bush was subpoenaed along with President Reagan as a defense
witness in the upcoming Iran-Contra conspiracy trial of former White
House aide Oliver North.
   The trial is to begin Jan. 31, which is 11 days after Bush
becomes president.
   He has repeatedly refused to say what he discussed with Reagan
regarding matters involved in the Iran-Contra affair, other than
that he had reservations about U.S. sales of arms to Iran.
   Bush's legal counsel Boyden Gray informed the president-elect
Friday morning that the subpoena would be forthcoming, said press
secretary Sheila Tate. She added it was ``not unanticipated.''
   She had no reaction from Bush but said he planned no meetings on
the subject while on a three-day vacation at the presidential
retreat in the Maryland countryside with his wife Barbara.
   As Bush left Washington, he also left unfilled the two
Cabinet-level posts he has not yet named _ energy secretary and drug
czar.
   Tate declined to indicate directly whether Bush would fight the
subpoena, but noted constitutional and legal questions were being
examined by White House and Justice Department lawyers, along with
Gray.
   ``What they're saying is that it's unprecedented to do that,''
she said in reference to potential Bush testimony.
   North is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12
million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   The Bushes planned to relax in seclusion until late Monday, and
were expecting to be joined by no friends or aides, said spokeswoman
Kristin Taylor.
   No announcements were expected before Tuesday on Bush's choices
for energy secretary and the new Cabinet-rank post of drug czar,
said David Prosperi, spokesman for the Bush transition team.
   While speculation continued to swirl around former Energy
Secretary James R. Schlesinger as a potential pick for that post,
the president-elect spent Friday meeting with his designee for
United Nations ambassador, Thomas Pickering, and with CIA Director
William Webster.
   Pickering, currently the ambassador to Israel, briefed Bush on
U.S.-Israeli relations and they discussed the current Middle East
peace process, said Taylor.
   Substance of his private meeting and luncheon with Webster was
not disclosed.
   While several names have been mentioned as possible choices for
energy secretary, those of Schlesinger and former Rep. Henson Moore,
R-La., were said by transition sources to be the leading contenders
at week's end.
   Air Force Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, head of the Pentagon's
Strategic Defense Initiative program, who had been mentioned earlier
as a contender for the energy job, has told friends he would not be
selected.
   For the Cabinet-level post of drug czar, created last year by
congressional legislation, the name of Customs Commissioner William
von Raab has been mentioned in several reports. However, von Raab's
aide, Steve Dougherty, said Friday that the commissioner has
received no query from nor had any official contact with the Bush
transition team.
   Meanwhile, the Bush transition office is expected to announce a
flurry of White House staff positions, including Bush campaign
operative Jim Wray as political director.
   Many names have surfaced as candidates for energy secretary, and
sources said the decision is being held up in part by strong
lobbying within the transition office for one or another candidate.
   Bush has said he wants someone with capabilities to deal with the
pressing problem of nuclear waste disposal and other nuclear safety
questions.
   Transition sources said Schlesinger, who served as the first
energy secretary when President Jimmy Carter appointed him, and
earlier as secretary of defense under Presidents Ford and Nixon, was
getting serious attention.
   Schlesinger's Washington office said Friday he would have no
comment on the matter.
   Moore's office also refused comment, but a source in the office
of one of his key boosters, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said Moore
has remained one of the top two contenders for he post.
   The independent-minded Schlesinger would be a controversial
choice, given opposition to him by industry leaders and his
affiliation with the trouble-plagued energy policies of the Carter
presidency.
   He was energy secretary when gasoline lines reappeared in the
summer of 1979, and resigned thereafter.
   He helped shape policy against which Ronald Reagan and Bush
campaigned in 1980, and large parts of which they dismantled _ a
massive government effort to develop unconventional sources of
energy, a so-called windfall profits tax on crude oil, help for the
poor faced with higher fuel bills and continued price controls on
natural gas. Bush in his campaign urged complete decontrol of
natural gas.
   Moore, who represented a chemicals- and refining-intensive
district around Baton Rouge, is a lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for
the Senate in 1986. He is backed my many in the oil industry, which
lost 150,000 jobs in the price collapse of recent years.
   Also frequently mentioned for the energy post is Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Lee Thomas, who revived the nearly
abortive ``superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program in 1983, and
presided over a quintupling of the program.
   Meanwhile, transition officials have told Dennis R. Patrick,
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, that Bush is
``fully satisfied with his performance and has no intention of
replacing him,'' FCC spokesman John Kamp said Friday.
   Many had expected Bush to replace Patrick at the helm of the FCC
in order to improve relations with Congress. Patrick's deregulatory
approach to the telecommunications and broadcasting industries has
made few friends among Democrats on Capitol Hill.

   A gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty
salon and released all but one during a 24-hour siege was shot and
killed by a police sniper Friday after threatening to detonate a
bomb in a suitcase.
   Michael Fane, 21, of Iowa City, Iowa, was shot by a SWAT team
sniper about 2:45 p.m. Friday at the beauty salon and all of the
hostages were safe, Police Chief Robert Wadman said.
   A bomb squad was called in to deal with the suitcase.
   ``It did not explode when they attempted to detonate,'' Capt.
Michael London said. ``All indications that they had at the time was
that it had the makings of a bomb. I can't tell you whether there
was an explosive device in there or not.''
   Police said they had believed Fane had a 9mm pistol but found he
had a 9mm look-alike pellet gun. Police said Fane probably could not
have killed anyone with it.
   ``We believe Mr. Fane was suffering from severe mental problems''
and was under psychiatric care, Wadman said.
   Early in the standoff, police said the hostage-taking occurred as
the result of a botched holdup, but later said they didn't know why
the camouflage-jacketed Fane entered the Possibilities salon about 3
p.m. Thursday.
   Police sealed off the neighborhood and the gunman released four
people, including a young boy, police said. After negotiating
through the night, he freed three women Friday. His final hostage, a
woman, was freed apparently unharmed after he was shot.
   Police would not release the names of the hostages, but relatives
and friends said three of the final four were Debbie McQueen, 28,
and shop employees Darla Lordemann and Sharon Kuhlmann, 18.
   London said Fane was shot while trying to pick up a package he
had demanded from police that was placed by the door.
   At a news conference, London said police decided to shoot Fane if
it became possible because they believed he had a suitcase bomb with
a ``pressure point'' that would detonate if he touched it.
   ``About 6 this morning, negotiations deteriorated seriously
because they found out at that time there was a great likeliehood
there was a bomb or the makings of a bomb or a bomb apparatus in a
suitcase,'' London said.
   Police evacuated bystanders west of the former bank building and
moved reporters and photographers a distance away because of fears
they could be hurt if a bomb was detonated.
   Fane, a 1985 graduate of Mason City, Iowa, High School, attended
the University of Iowa in Iowa City for two years. His father, Dr.
Larry Fane of El Compo, Texas, told the Mason City, Iowa,
Globe-Gazette that his son recently received psychiatric treatment.
   Dean Chandler, Fane's grandfather, said of Fane, ``He's always
been very passive and mild around us. This is the biggest surprise
of my life and that's all I'm going to say.''
   The gunman negotiated undisclosed demands with police, Capt.
William Crawford said during a Friday news conference. He would not
say what the demands were, but he did say the gunman had not asked
for money.
   Sgt. William Muldoon said police knew ``quite a bit'' about the
gunman, but would not elaborate. He had said the man had remained
calm during negotiations.
   ``He is talking, so that's always a good sign,'' Muldoon said.
``He's not doing anything directly at this time to harm the people.
... If he starts harming people we will have to re-evaluate the
situation.''
   A minister and family members of the hostages were assisting
police in negotiations. More than 40 family members gathered at a
nearby house Thursday night and were taken to a Salvation Army
center to meet with police chaplains and other clergy.

   Investigators have told Scottish police that the
bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 was put aboard in Frankfurt,
West Germany, The Times of London reported Saturday.
   The report said investigators are certain that luggage loaded on
Flight 103 in Frankfurt and flown to London's Heathrow airport was
transferred on arrival at Heathrow to the forward cargo hold of the
doomed Boeing 747.
   It said scientists have established that the bomb exploded in
that hold, causing the jumbo jet to disintegrate.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, changed planes at Heathrow
and continued to New York.
   The jet crashed in the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21
less than an hour after taking off from Heathrow, killing all 259
people aboard and 11 on the ground.
   The account said the hunt for those responsible is now centered
in Frankfurt ``where a Palestinian terrorist cell is known to have
been operating for more than 18 months.''
   It said the cell is known to be part of Ahmed Jibril's hardline
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and to
have carried out two bombing attacks on U.S. military trains that
serve Frankfurt.
   The paper did not identify by name the source of its information.
   It said Scottish police officers who flew to Frankfurt on Friday
would be shown evidence of the terrorist unit's existence and are
expected to be given access to a Palestinian man arrested by West
German security forces two months ago.
   It did not identify the man but said he is suspected of being a
senior figure in Jibril's organization.
   The paper noted that the Jibril group, in a statement in Damascus
Friday, denied any connection with the crash. But it said the denial
was regarded skeptically by terrorism experts, who believed the
group was trying to avoid possible U.S. military retaliation.
   An anonymous male caller claiming to represent a group called the
Guardians of the Islamic Revolution telephoned American news
agencies in London Friday to repeat a claim of responsibility and
threaten further attacks.
   The blue-and-white nose cone of Flight 103 was removed from the
Scottish countryside Friday so investigators can examine the
``symbol of this disaster'' for clues to the bomb.
   The search for wreckage expanded from Lockerbie and surrounding
countryside into the waters of the Solway Firth, said Deputy Chief
Constable Paul Newell of the regional police force.
   He said the coast guard was acting on an eyewitness report that
something fell into the inlet, about 20 miles from Lockerbie.
   The airplane's nose cone and cockpit, with its name, ``Clipper
Maid of the Seas,'' still visible, had lain in a field beside a
church for eight days, a silent reminder of the tragedy.
   ``The picture of this nose cone has been seen throughout the
world,'' said police Chief Superintendent Angus Kennedy. ``It has
become a symbol of this disaster.''
   On Friday helicopters and trucks hauled the cut-up wreckage to
the Royal Aerospace Establishment 300 miles south at Farnborough,
southwest of London.
   Investigators from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents
Investigation Branch will examine it for clues about the bomb.
   Police roped off an area near the wreckage where relatives of
crash victims can place flowers.
   The Times reported Friday that investigators believe the bomb's
first trigger was a barometric device set to go off under a change
of altitude. This would activate the second trigger, an electronic
timer, to make the bomb explode at a later time, it said.
   Terrorists developed the double detonator technique after some
airports started putting cargo through pressure chambers which can
detonate pressure-activated bombs, The Times said.
   ``The investigators have yet to establish whether a suitcase
containing the bomb passed through Frankfurt's pressure chamber,
setting off the timing device, or whether the timer was activated in
flight,'' the newspaper said.
   The caller claiming to speak for the Guardians of the Islamic
Revolution said Friday that unless the United States deports Reza
Pahlavi, son of the late Shah of Iran, ``there will be another
present in the New Year for America.''
   The day after the crash, an anonymous caller claimed it was
retaliation by the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution for downing
of an Iran Air airliner by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in the
Persian Gulf in July.
   The group previously claimed responsibility for a July 1987
bombing in London that wounded Amir Hussein Amir-Parviz, chairman of
the National Movement for Iranian Resistance and a Cabinet minister
under the shah.
   President-elect George Bush vowed to ``seek hard and punish
firmly, decisively, those who did this _ if you can ever find them.''
   Police Chief Superintendent John Orr, who is leading the
investigation in conjunction with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
squad and the FBI, said that besides the officers sent to Frankfurt,
others may be sent to ``other parts of the world.''
   American airlines using four British airports were implementing
tighter security procedures on orders from the British government,
including tougher baggage inspections.

   A moderate earthquake shook San Jose and
other South Bay communities Friday afternoon, but no injuries or
damages were reported, authorities said.
   The earthquake struck at 3:54 p.m. abou 15 miles east of San Jose
and measured 4.3 on the Richter scale, said Pat Jorgenson, of the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   The quake occurred on the Calaveras fault and was felt as far
north as Palo Alto, about 15 miles north of San Jose and 45 miles
south of San Francisco, said Jorgenson.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
A single increase in magnitude, as in from 5.5 to 6.5, means a
tenfold increase of ground motion.
   A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while
a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake
in Alaska hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of an artillery shell containing
conventional explosives and depleted uranium was accidentally
shipped to the Sandia National Laboratories, a newspaper reported
Friday.
   The test shell sat at the lab for four days in August 1987 before
it was discovered, said the San Jose Mercury News.
   Depleted uranium is incapable of causing a nuclear explosion and
only slightly radioactive, but it is poisonous when inhaled.
   Officials at Sandia's main facility in Albuquerque, N.M., said
the risk of a conventional explosion was very low.
   ``It didn't pose any danger,'' said Nigel Hey, a Sandia spokesman
in Albuquerque, on Friday. ``The thing is we just didn't follow the
rules.''
   The shell was shipped to the lab as unclassified freight from the
Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, where a clerk mixed it up with another
shipment. The shell was to have remained there for a future
shipment, where it would have been properly labeled.
   The wooden crate carrying the device should have been marked as
classified package containing explosive and radioactive material,
Hey said. It was supposed to be shipped to a secret weapons testing
site at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
   Instead, it was flown to the Alameda Naval Air Station by a
government contractor and carried to the Sandia lab by a Department
of Energy truck as a routine delivery. The shell was placed under
armed guard after its discovery.
   ``It caused a lot of concern, and it was taken as an example of
how things can go wrong,'' Hey said. Test range officials have since
revised shipping rules.

   The Contra rebels on Friday proposed a new round of
peace talks with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, to be
held in Washington under the auspices of the Organization of
American States.
   ``We believe that this could break the impasse,'' Contra director
Roberto Ferrey said at the Contra headquarters in Miami. ``We are
accepting one of their proposals.''
   Talks between the U.S.-backed rebels have been stalled since June
when negotiations broke up in Managua, and the Contras refused to
return to the country, saying they were being harassed.
   Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the
shaky truce, and a cutoff of U.S. military aid has sent many Contra
troops across the border into refugee camps in Honduras.
   The Sandinistas have expressed willingness to meet in Washington
or Managua on previous occasions, said Ferrey. He said the OAS would
be a natural forum for the peace talks.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally known,
sent a telecopy of their proposal to the Sandinista foreign ministry
in Managua early Friday, Ferrey said, but have not yet received a
response.
   ``The Resistance proposes that the point of departure of this
round be the same proposals presented in June,'' Ferrey said. ``The
democratization of Nicaragua followed by troops surrendering of
arms.''
   But he said the Contras were flexible and would be willing to
change that agenda.

   ``This takes the cake. This weekend has turned into the second

   A steak fry and private rodeo are planned Sunday for about 7,500
people, complete with fireworks, dancing and the Mountaineer mascot
parading on the back of a bull.
   The event, at Rawhide, a Western theme park in Scottsdale, is so

   In the home of the New Year's tradition synonymous with the chaos
of the night's revelry, the ball to be dropped at the stroke of
midnight in New York City's Times Square will be different. The
wrought-iron ball replaces the red apple used in recent years
``because it's a more universal symbol,'' said Tama Starr, president
of Artkraft Strauss Sign Corp., which created the new ball.
   The dropping of the ball began in 1908.
   New Yorkers who party at a downtown nightclub called B2 will be
treated to a shower of dollar bills _ $5,000 worth _ that will rain

able to recoup the $65 price of admission.
   At Manhattan's Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a free ``Concert

   About 1,000 artists will exhibit and perform on Boston's public
plazas and storefront stages for the city's 13th annual First Night
celebration.
   ``It's an opportunity for everyone to come together to celebrate
the city's cultural life and feel a part of it,'' said Bruce
Rossley, the city's commissioner for arts and humanities.
   Rhode Islanders will have a choice of First Night and Last Night
celebrations. The fourth annual First Night in Providence is
expected to draw about 40,000 people for a variety of alcohol-free
festivities. The Last Night is a farewell party at the 100-year-old
Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet ballroom, which is closing for at least two
years.
   At Patriots Square, a new downtown park in Phoenix, there will be
space heaters and tents to keep some 1,000 partygoers warm as they
watch fireworks and bands New Year's Eve. Low temperatures in recent
days have been running in the 20s and 30s, unusually cold for this
time of year. Those who attend are being asked to bring blankets for
seating during the event, to then be distributed to the homeless.
   In New Hampshire, where snow is routine for New Year's, the city
of Concord is manufacturing the powdery stuff on the Statehouse lawn
for the ice sculptures to be featured in its First Night celebration
New Year's Eve. The downtown area will be roped off to traffic so
the thousands of celebrants can take in such events as band
concerts, dances, puppet shows, chorales, storytelling and trick
bike acts, climaxed by fireworks at midnight.
   Included in the First Night celebration in Portsmouth, N.H., will
be a petting farm featuring farm animals. The idea is to increase
the understanding of agriculture among schoolchildren.
   And to remind partygoers to keep it a happy new year, Mothers
Against Drunk Driving in Ohio is sponsoring a statewide ``Tie One
On'' program to tie red ribbons on antennas and rearview mirrors as
a reminder to motorists not to drink and drive.
   The program began Thanksgiving weekend and runs until the new
year.
   The Ohio State Highway Patrol plans to have 200 to 300 of it's
1,200 troopers on duty at any given time over this weekend.
   ``Our policy is visibility,'' said Lt. Dave Peters. ``The more
people we have out, the better it is,'' he said.
   In Albany, N.Y., area hotels are offering weekend party packages
that include dinner, entertainment, champagne, overnight
accommodations and a New Year's Day brunch.
   ``People are very verbal about not drinking and driving,'' said
Shelley Gould, director of catering for the Hilton Hotel in downtown
Albany. ``They don't want to worry about it. ... That's why they
take the whole weekend.''

   Colombia for the first time Friday
suspended payment on its $16.5-billion foreign debt for three
months, when the government is to obtain a new loan to meet the
payments.
   Treasury Minister Luis Fernando Alarcon, who announced the
decision, said the country's creditors agreed to the suspension.
   Colombia was the only Latin American country up to now that had
not restructured its debt or suspended its payments.
   The minister said Colombia will receive in April an international
loan of $1.7 billion that will ensure it will have the funds needed
to pay interest and principal on the foreign debt until 1990.
   The 90-day moratorium means Colombia will not pay $300 million,
which can be used for economic development programs, he told a news
conference.
   The $300 million will be paid after Colombia receives the
additional loan, he said.
   Colombia had asked for a $1.85 billion loan in negotiations with
international bankers to pay its foreign debt.
   Political leaders and economic analysts had recommended that
President Virgilio Barco's government renegotiate the foreign debt
under more favorable terms. In recent years, 40 percent of
Colombia's income from exports has been spent to service the debt.
   Congress last week approved a law making it easier for the
government to renegotiate the debt with its creditors, saying it was
impossible to continue paying the debt under the current schedule.

<HEAD>Bishop Murder Trial Appeal Left Up in the Air By Death of Presiding
Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Grenada Appeals
Court, Justice J.O.F. Haynes, has died, leaving in limbo the appeal
of 14 defendants convicted in the 1983 murder of leftist Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop.
   Bishop was overthrown and shot by a firing squad as a result of
factional feuding in his government. A Marxist junta took power,
leading to an invasion of Grenada by the United States, joined by
seven Eastern Caribbean nations that provided token forces. The
junta in turn was overthrown.
   Haynes, 76, died Wednesday in his native Guyana. A former
chancellor of the judiciary in Guyana, he was admitted to Georgetown
Hospital this month after returning from Barbados, where he also was
treated for an undisclosed illness.
   He is to be buried in Georgetown on Monday.
   Legal sources here, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
predicted that the entire appeal proceedings will have to be held
from the beginning as result of Haynes' death and the need to
appoint a new appeal court president.
   Haynes had recently chided defense and prosecution lawyers for
tardiness in proceeding with the appeal.
   ``If one of the judges were to die, the whole appeal will have to
be heard again,'' the state-owned Guyana Chronicle had quoted Haynes
as saying.
   Haynes had not been in good health for some time and appeared to
have had a premonition of his death.
   He remarked during a hearing of the Bishop appeal on Dec. 9, ``I
am living on borrowed time.''
   Hearings began on May 30 on the appeal of 14 former members of
Bishop's New Jewel Movement and the revolutionary government who
were convicted in Bishop's murder. Since then, the hearings had
taken up a total of 27 days.
   Proceedings had been adjourned until Jan. 28. It was expected
that a judgment would be handed down by summer.
   Haynes' death means this timetable will have to be revised to
find a replacement for Haynes and to give the new president time to
study the court records of the murder trial.

   A district court in southern
Yugoslavia on Friday sentenced eight ethnic Albanians to prison
terms ranging from four to 11 years for ``hostile activity,'' the
official Tanjug news agency reported.
   It said the court found them guilty of organizing a demonstration
by hundreds of ethnic Albanian schoolchildren last October in the
Macedonian town of Gostivar to protest a decision by education
authorities to limit instruction in the Albanian language.
   Ajredin Kaza, 32, the alleged head of the group, drew 11 years in
prison; Nazif Zinani, 29, and Zulufchli Dalipi, 29, each received
eight years; Imrli Bektesiju, 19, was sentenced to six years and
four unidentified minors were meted prison terms ranging from four
to six years, Tanjug said.
   The southern republic of Macedonia has been the scene of
increasing ethnic strife between the majority Slav population and a
rapidly growing minority of ethnic Albanians, who have been moving
south from troubled Kosovo province.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been sentenced to long jail
terms in Kosovo since riots there in 1981, when some ethnic
Albanians demanded greater autonomy for the province and its ethnic
Albanian population.

   Isamu Noguchi, the renowned American sculptor
whose work graces museums, gardens and parks around the world, died
Friday after a brief illness. He was 84.
   Noguchi, whose work blended the esthetics of East and West, was
best known for monumental public sculpture but also designed
furniture and lamps, stage sets, gardens, fountains, playgrounds and
worked in several artistic media.
   He received the National Medal of Arts from President Reagan at
the White House in June 1987.
   ``He was one of the most important artists of the 20th century,''
said Jennifer Russell, associate director of the Whitney Museum of
American Art. ``His career had an extraordinary range.''
   Among his works are the gleaming steel Dodge Memorial Fountain in
Detroit, a 28-foot red cube that stands on one of its corners in
front of a lower Manhattan bank and the Sunken Garden at New York's
Chase Manhattan Plaza. He also designed the UNESCO garden in Paris,
the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden in Jerusalem and two bridges for
Hiroshima's Peace Park.
   Noguchi worked in many materials including wood, bronze and
galvanized steel, but his major sculptures are made of stone:
basalt, granite and marble.
   He is represented in the permanent collections of such major
American museums as the Metropolitan, Whitney and Modern in New
York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Detroit Art Institute,
Seattle Art Museum and Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis.
   ``America has lost its greatest living sculptor,'' said Allen
Wardwell, director of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in Queens.
``Of course he was much more than a sculptor _ he was a designer of
spaces, stage sets, gardens, fountains and the decorative arts. He
was a great thinker and visionary.''
   ``Art was it. He wrote a lot, but it was about art,'' Wardwell
said.
   ``He was very much an innovator and not a follower,'' said Ms.
Russell.
   Noguchi once said he was ``suspicious of the whole business of
style _ again it is a form of inhibition.''
   Wardwell said Noguchi died at New York University Medical Center
at 2 a.m. Friday of heart failure.
   At the time of his death, he had just returned from Italy and was
working on several large marble sculptures among other projects,
including the Bayfront Park in Miami, a memorial to the Challenger
astronauts. He had just been commissioned to do a major park for the
city of Sapporo, Japan.
   Noguchi lived in New York but spent much time in Japan, including
his formative years, and he employed numerous artisans at a large
workshop in Takamatsu on the Japanese island of Shikoku.
   The son of a Japanese poet and an American writer, he was born in
Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 1904, but two years later his family took
him to Tokyo. He returned alone to the United States in 1918 and
went to school in Indiana.
   Noguchi entered Columbia University as a pre-medical student in
1922, but dropped out in favor of sculpture studies at the Leonardo
Da Vinci Art School, now defunct.
   He moved to Paris in 1928 and became a studio assistant for
Constantin Brancusi for six months. During that time, his earliest
works were made. Noguchi returned to New York in 1929 and had his
first one-man show at the Eugene Schoen Gallery.
   He survived on the sales of a few bronze head portraits and on
grants, including a Guggenheim fellowship in 1927, which enabled him
to travel to Japan and China, where he studied drawing, ink-brush
painting and pottery.
   One of his first competitive successes was a 1938 commission for
the 10-ton, stainless-steel relief above the entrance to The
Associated Press Building at Rockefeller Center. The piece, one of
his few representational pieces, depicts five journalists at work.
   His sculptures were often smooth-surfaced vaguely biological
forms that remind some scholars of the surrealistic paintings of
Joan Miro and of primitive Japanese ``haniwa'' figures. In later
years his work became more geometric, while retaining organic
imagery.
   The naturalistic style was once described in The New York Times
as ``a restrained vocabulary of organic forms ranging from playful
biomorphs and abstract figures to subtle mounds, polished rings and
massive boulders.''
   He said he was fascinated by ``abandoned stones'' that ``allow me
to enter into their life's purpose.''
   His works are found outside the United States at Tokyo's Museum
of Modern Art, the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the
Rijksmuseum Kroller-Muller in Otterlo, the Netherlands, the Ulster
Museum in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and the Bayerische Vereinsbank
in Munich, West Germany.
   Noguchi had an active social life, but lived modestly in a small
apartment. He was married briefly to the Japanese actress Yoshiko
Yamaguchi but they were separated by immigration difficulties and
later divorced. They had no children. He is survived by a sister,
Ailes Spinden of Santa Fe, N.M.
   There will be a memorial service at the Noguchi Garden Museum
Feb. 7, but the funeral and burial services will be private,
Wardwell said.

UPDATE with report that Justice and White House officials say
they'll fight subpoenas, that Reagan viewed subpoena as attempt to

   President Reagan and President-elect Bush were
subpoenaed Friday as defense witnesses in the trial of retired
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We did receive it,'' Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller
said. ``There's one for the president and one for the vice
president. We received it at mid-afternoon.'' The subpoenas were
received by Robert Ross, the executive assistant to Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, Miller said.
   A statement released by the White House press office in Palm
Springs, Calif., where Reagan is on vacation, said, ``The Justice
Department has received a subpoena seeking the president's testimony
at the criminal trial of Oliver North. The subpoena also seeks the
discovery of certain personal records of the president. The subpoena
was not an unanticipated development.
   ``It raises significant legal and constitutional questions which
are currently being reviewed by the Department of Justice and
counsel to the president,'' the statement said. ``It would be
unprecedented for a president to appear as a witness at a criminal
trial and it's premature to speculate on the final decision that
will ultimately be taken, but historical precedent suggests any
relevant information could be provided through written questions and
answers.''
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions that
unidentified White House and Justice Department officials said they
will fight the subpoenas.
   The newspaper also cited an unidentified White House official as
saying Reagan viewed the subpoena effort as an attempt to pressure
him into granting a pardon to North before he leaves office. The
official said Reagan had not changed his view that the legal process
should run its course.
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said Reagan had known
since Wednesday that it was likely he would be subpoenaed. White
House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein told Reagan on Friday
morning that the subpoena would be delivered during the afternoon,
Popadiuk said.
   Bush aides confirmed that the president-elect had received a
subpoena Friday.
   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said Bush legal counsel Boyden
Gray informed the vice president Friday morning that the subpoena
would be delivered that afternoon, and she did not know Bush's
reaction.
   She said he was going ahead with his weekend of relaxation at
Camp David, Md., and planned no meetings to discuss the trial
matter. Gray, she said, did have conferences on the matter Friday,
but she said she could give no further details.
   ``The receipt of this is not an unanticipated development, but it
is unprecedented,'' said Bush press aide Kristin Taylor.
   Bush will take office Jan. 20 and thus will be president when the
North trial begins Jan. 31.
   North, a former White House aide, is facing conspiracy and theft
charges in the Iran-Contra affair.
   He is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12
million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   National security concerns have placed in jeopardy North's trial
on the major conspiracy and theft charges, which involve extensive
use of classified material.
   North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, appearing on ABC News, did
not go into any detail on why Reagan and Bush were subpoenaed.
   ``What I do say is this: As you know, a defense lawyer has an
obligation to issue a subpoena for every person who has relevant
information about a matter in court,'' Sullivan said. ``The
president himself has indicated he has relevant information.''
   Attorneys for the vice president, the White House and the Justice
Department were looking into the ``constitutional legal issues''
raised by the subpoenas, Taylor said.
   In 1973, President Nixon received a subpoena to turn over White
House tape recordings of conversations with top aides in connection
with the Watergate scandal. Although Nixon was not required to
testify, the Supreme Court ruled that Nixon had to release the tapes.
   Tate said she could not say whether Bush's attorneys would fight
the subpoena.
   ``What they're saying is that it's unprecedented to do that,''
she said in reference to potential Bush testimony.
   The issue of how much he knew about North's activities with the
Contras and the diversion of funds from Iran was the subject of
contradictory testimony during congressional hearings into the
Iran-Contra matter.
   The subpoena could force Bush to disclose information that he
previously has refused to divulge.
   Bush repeatedly has refused to say what he discussed with Reagan
regarding matters involved in the Iran-Contra affair, other than
that he had reservations about U.S. sales of arms to Iran.
   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concluded
last year that there was no evidence Bush knew of the diversion plan.
   Bush also said he did not know of North's secret operation to
supply the Contras during the congressional ban on aid, although his
national security adviser Donald Gregg was well informed on the
matter, and Bush met three times with Felix Rodriguez, one of the
key figures helping North in the operation.
   Questions also were raised about Bush's statement that he did not
know of the arms-for-hostages nature of the dealings with Iran until
late 1986, when his chief of staff indicated that Israeli operative
Amiram Nir briefed Bush on this aspect in May of 1986.
   Bush has said he was told about the Israeli side of the
operation, not the American activity in the same vein.

and appears headed for success. In fact, Sen. Sam Nunn and Rep. Les
Aspin, chairmen of the Senate and House armed services committees,

   Nunn, D-Ga., and Aspin, D-Wis., pledged to work hard to ensure
that the plan is not blocked by lawmakers concerned over jobs lost

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has until Jan. 15, five days

recommendations, which were presented to the Pentagon on Thursday by
the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. There appeared
little doubt that Carlucci would back the proposal enthusiastically.

   The government of Premier Branko
Mikulic resigned today, the state Tanjug news agency said. It was
the first resignation by a federal government since the Communist
Party came to power after World War II.
   Mikulic's government was faced with widespread public calls for
its resignation because of its apparent inability to resolve the
country's economic crisis, which includes a 250 percent annual
inflation rate, a $21 billion foreign debt and a 15 percent
unemployment rate.
   Yugoslavia has registered a record number of strikes this year,
with workers protesting low wages and declining living standards
that now are comparable to the level of mid-1960s.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hedrick Smith's ``The Power Game'' comes to life
beginning tonight in a four-part series that is a kind of video
Cliff Notes for the 725-page best-seller about the machinations of
official Washington.
   Pegged to run just before the inauguration of George Bush, the
PBS series is also something of a scorecard for interested viewers
who want to keep track of the players as the new game begins.
   Produced by Philip Burton with David Saltman and Pam Hogan, the
series of one-hour programs is fast-paced and entertaining. It
boasts interviews with an impressive array of current and former
officials _ including President-elect Bush _ but avoids too many
talking-head interviews by blending in news footage and flashy
graphics.
   Smith, a Pulitzer Prize-wining print reporter and author (``The
Russians'') is a pleasant host and experienced interviewer.
   The series hones the book down into four topics _ ``The
Congress,'' ``The Pentagon,'' ``The Unelected'' and ``The
Presidency.'' The installments run in that order, Monday through
Thursday.
   With Bush coming in, the final two segments _ ``The Unelected,''
about the power of staff and the news media, and ``The Presidency''
_ are especially interesting.
   In ``The Presidency,'' Smith outlines the three things he says a
successful president must immediately do:
   _Set a simple agenda. Jimmy Carter, he says, cluttered his
agenda, confusing his would-be supporters on Capitol Hill.
   _Form coalitions. Carter and John F. Kennedy were good
image-makers who had problems working with Congress, Smith says.
Carter had the added problem of a post-Watergate and post-Vietnam
Congress filled with mavericks unbeholden to the leadership.
   _Create an image. Reagan's team masterfully managed the media.
   Smith got a late interview with Bush for inclusion in the ``The
Presidency.'' A transcript was provided to television critics. If
Bush has read Smith's book, he doesn't seem to buy its theories.
   ``It seems to me, listening to you, I hear a few echoes of Jimmy
Carter,'' says Smith. ``That may sound strange to you. I don't mean
in terms ...''
   Bush interrupts, ``That sounds very strange!''
   Smith continues, ``What I mean is that when Jimmy Carter came in,
he wanted to do something about the environment. He wanted to do
something about education. He wanted to do something about the
deficit, and on and on. And one of the problems he had was focusing
the Congress. He confused the Congress and he confused the country.''
   ``Please don't suggest to me that if I don't say that _ if I
throw in the question of trying to do something better on fighting
narcotics that that means I'm not interested in the deficit, the one
major, you know, economic problem facing us,'' Bush argued. ``But I
think to be so unipurpose that you say you're gonna do nothing else
until the deficit is solved is myopic.''
   The main theme in the four programs is the phenomenon of
``floating'' power _ from the presidency to Congress, the news media
and staff members. From Congress to its staff on Capitol Hill. From
the news media back to the president.
   Smith shows how Reagan's own National Security Council staff
pursued the Strategic Defense Initiative, or so-called ``Star
Wars,'' without informing high-level advisers, some of whom talk of
learning about the proposed massive shift in defense policy only
days or hours before Reagan announced it to the nation in a 1983
speech.
   A powerful media set the agendas for Watergate and later the Iran
hostage crisis.
   But Reagan advance man William Henkel describes an amazing feat
of media management when he describes scheduling Reagan's stopoff in
Brussels to brief NATO on his summit meeting with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev just so Reagan's helicopter would arrive on
Capitol Hill later that night at the top of the evening newscasts.
   Smith told a news conference at PBS that he was delighted by the
documentary experience and hopes to get the money to produce an
examination of the first 100 days of the Bush administration, ``to
take `The Power Game' analysis forward and apply it to this new
administration.''
   ``Even though you get a good audience with 100,000 copies of the
hardback and several hundred thousand with the paperback, to be able
to reach several million people at once with a concentrated dose in
terms of this kind of material, I'm just enough of an idealist and
fresh enough to the game to want to throw a lot more into it,''
Smith said.

   Two riveting mysteries unfold in Thursday
night's CBS movie, ``The Man in the Brown Suit.''
   Who killed the sultry chanteuse? And how many more ensembles can
Stephanie Zimbalist produce from her tiny carry-on bag?
   Advertised as an ``intriguing mystery-drama,'' the movie is
intriguing in only one regard: Can dramatic improbability really go
any further?
   Why Zimbalist, playing a flaky tourist stuck in Egypt, wants to
stalk a murderer is never explained. How a car moving at about 8 mph
can kill somebody is equally perplexing.
   The only thing that makes perfect sense is why Edward Woodward,
Rue McClanahan, Ken Howard, Tony Randall and Zimbalist all agreed to
star in this clunker _ a neat chance to visit Spain for free.
   Based, more or less, on a 1924 Agatha Christie novel, ``The Man
in the Brown Suit'' focuses on a couple of murders _ or maybe one
was an accident? _ some missing diamonds, a handsome stranger in a
brown suit, several suspects, a kidnapping, an EZ-Escape jail cell,
a half-dozen lurking-in-the-shadows bad guys and a whole bunch of
romantic European film locations.
   Zimbalist stars as Anne Beddingfeld, a camera-toting traveler
lost in the Cairo airport with hardly any luggage and nothing much
to do except whimper. Before you can say ``plot device,'' a man at
the airport who smells like musk _ no kidding _ is hit by that
deadly slow-moving car, and we're on our merry way.
   On the dead man's body is a piece of paper that _ surprise! _
might be a clue. After the handsome stranger _ the one in the brown
suit _ drops the note he has stolen from the corpse, Beddingfeld
scoops it up. ``I don't want to leave now,'' she says. ``The
adventure hasn't started yet.''
   Using sleuthing skills that would make Nancy Drew relax in her
retirement, Beddingfeld books a cabin on a small cruise ship and
sets to work. On board, lucky for her, are all of the key players in
the unsolved chanteuse murder and a related diamond theft. Below
decks somewhere must also be a Bloomingdale's, as Beddingfeld never
seems to run out of fresh outfits.
   Suspects include the man in the brown suit (Simon Dutton),
dashing English businessman Sir Eustace Pedler (Woodward), his
assistant Underhill (Nickolas Grace), oft-married socialite Suzy
Blair (McClanahan) and a creepy priest (Randall).
   Special acting points should be given to Randall and Woodward for
working up new dialects especially for this project. Randall sounds
like Quasimodo on a caffeine overdose, and Woodward manages a
brilliant John Cleese impersonation. Ken Howard takes the smarter
route, spending most of the movie hiding behind dark sunglasses. If
he could have seen the finished movie, he probably would have worn a
hat and fake moustache, too.
   The creaky script, by Carla Jean Wagner, runs low on action and
overflows with talk. When Beddingfeld jots down a list of suspects,
she has to announce each person's motive _ the film's director, Alan
Grint, couldn't impart such basic information with his camera.
   Beddingfeld and Blair eventually join forces. ``Oh Lord,'' says
Blair, ``this is so exciting I feel just like one of Charlie's
Angels!''
   The closer Beddingfeld moves to solving the mystery, such as it
is, the more endangered her life becomes. After Beddingfeld is
almost pushed overboard into the sea, she survives a plunge into a
waterfall.
   Tough private detective that she is, the watery near-deaths only
strengthen her determination.
   Does she solve the crime? Does anybody care?
   The rewards of ``The Man in the Brown Suit'' do not rest with the
delivery of justice. Instead, the fascination is found in the
preposterous depths to which this story slinks. All-star camp, after
all, is all-star camp.

   Economists will tell you they make their
prognostications on the basis of ``the data,'' not gut feelings
about the economy.
   But some attending last week's conference here of the American
Economic Association were bold enough to venture guesses on the fate
of the economy without their usual battery of numbers at hand.
   Yes, there were scores of seminars during the conference on such
esoteric topics as ``Empirical Analysis of Price Determinants'' (and
we wonder why Johnny can't understand simple rules of economics).
   But there was also a fair amount of cocktail and luncheon chatter
about what economists might call ``exogenous'' _ or outside _
factors affecting the ebb and flow of the economy. Principal among
them, politics _ George Bush's politics, to be more precise.
   Theories about how the president-elect will manage the economy
span the usual spectrum, as you might expect. Yet a predominantly
hopeful theory is emerging in some quarters, based on Bush's
transition performance.
   While some pundits have criticized his recently announced Cabinet
selections as bland, others are impressed by the mix of key
holdovers from the Reagan administration and new choices aimed at
mending fences with old opponents.
   So far, these optimists say, Bush has done several things right.
When the markets reacted negatively in the days following his
election, he moved swiftly to name his ``economic team,'' long
before settling on advisers for defense and other areas.
   Among his earliest choices was Nicholas Brady to remain as
Treasury secretary, a pick that was applauded by those who admired
Brady's work as head of the Reagan committee investigating the
October 1987 stock market crash. Having James A. Baker III, a former
Treasury secretary and an architect of past accords to stabilize the
dollar in world markets, as secretary of state also was seen as a
plus by some economic experts.
   Later additions that have drawn praise are Michael Boskin of
Stanford University to chief economic adviser, Clayton Yeutter to
agriculture secretary, Robert Mosbacher to commerce secretary and
Elizabeth Dole to head the Labor Department.
   The Dole move was viewed as especially significant since it not
only installed an experienced hand at the wheel of labor, but also
helped smooth the ruffled feathers of the secretary-designate's
husband, Senate minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Other rough spots in the road that Bush quickly patched were in
Massachusetts. He initiated a meeting with his defeated challenger,
Michael Dukakis, and also offered to make ex-House Speaker Tip
O'Neill of Massachusetts the next ambassador to Ireland. Neither of
the high-profile Democrats will end up serving the new
administration, but Bush's thoughtful gestures weren't lost on the
loyal opposition.
   The optimists say Bush's style may help him make strides on
Capitol Hill, where Democratic cooperation will be crucial to
keeping his pledge of no new taxes.
   One economist at last week's conference, James Smith of the
University of North Carolina, said he predicts a great ``Rose Garden
compromise'' along about April that will put a two-year federal
budget in place, restrain the deficit and maybe even avoid new taxes.
   That certainly would provide the so-called ``soft landing'' the
economy needs to avert recession in 1989.
   Non-believers would say such fine-tuning went out a long time
ago, about the time Paul Volcker used sky-high interest rates to
squelch inflation. Still, the prospect of striking a delicate
balance in economic policy, between bust and boom, is intriguing _
particularly now, a few weeks before the inauguration when hope
springs eternal.

<HEAD>Operation Rescue Head: Create `Social Tension' To Change Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Where most people list their job
experiences, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry's resume brags,
``Arrested 26 times in seven cities.''
   Terry complains it's out-of-date.
   ``It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activist
said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in
upstate New York where the latest protests against abortion are
being planned.
   Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion a
high-profile issue again.
   Terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion
clinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until police
carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras.
   Terry says he is trying to produce the ``social tension''
necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960s
civil rights protest as a model.
   ``He's the Martin Luther King of a movement,'' said Dominick
Brignola, an Albany lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortion
drive.
   Terry's critics claim Operation Rescue, so named because
followers try to ``rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women's
rights.
   ``The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people.
They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing human
beings,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women.
   More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged Atlanta jails
during the five-day Democratic convention. Since then,
demonstrations have spread to New York City, Indianapolis,
Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Boston and still more cities.
   The activists want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade,
its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated
1.6 million women have abortions each year in the United States.
   Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used car
salesman who once wanted to be a rock star.
   Terry and his wife, Cindy, began their crusade in 1984 by
standing in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out of
entering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an office
that offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down baby
clothes.
   ``God clicked a light on in my head and said it wasn't enough to
just be against child-killing, that I had to do something about
it,'' said Terry, who's selling his auto dealership because he is
too busy with Operation Rescue.
   Critics concede Terry has a mesmerizing personality. He even
tries to convert relatives at family reunions, said Dawn Marvin of
Rochester, his aunt.
   Terry was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quit
high school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said Marvin, who
is communications director for the Rochester chapter of Planned
Parenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequently
target. She stressed that she does not speak for the organization
about her nephew.
   ``He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about Terry's
transformation into a born-again Christian. ``He came back a totally
changed personality. It was more like a cult reaction than a
spiritual quest.''
   Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesman
have calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child and
three foster children.
   Terry dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessment
that ``he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention.
   To Margaret Johnston, administrator at Southern Tier Women's
Services in Binghamton, Operation Rescue is nothing new. She said
anti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and
glued the clinic's door shut four or five times.
   Terry's first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himself
to a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for
22 days for refusing to pay a $60 fine.
   ``It doesn't matter what you say to him. There is no reason
involved,'' Johnston said. ``He doesn't care about women. I think he
really hates women.''
   Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the
Binghamton clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-present
demonstrators at shouting distance.
   ``They really want to make it personal,'' Johnston said.
   Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office,
Johnston said Terry has shouted at her, ``How many babies did you
murder today?''
   Terry criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being ``too nice''
during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friend
like President Reagan into not working hard for its goal.
   ``We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' he
said. ``That's not an adequate response to murder. A logical
response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the
victim.''
   The lean, bushy-haired Terry expects and even hopes his
demonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue is
responsible for 11,000 arrests this year and predicts 500,000 will
be arrested in the next year.
   There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified.
   ``In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their own
beliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent children
murdered,'' he said.
   ``That's like saying, `Why can't a white man follow his own
conscience concerning owning a black slave? Why can't a German
follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?'''
   Terry has attracted some prominent supporters, including former
presidential candidate Pat Robertson, who said he backs ``any means
short of violence'' to stop abortion.
   If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, Terry said,
they could change abortion laws in six months because the political
system is not built to deal with mass protests.
   Yard dismisses Terry as a ``puppet'' groomed for the role of
point man in the latest anti-abortion offensive.
   ``Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. ``The
reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings (of
abortion clinics) and Operation Rescue is that people don't believe
Roe vs. Wade can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I know
is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.''
   At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted.
   Pinned to the wall is a large map of the United States, with
``abortion mills'' dotted in red. Terry distractedly complains to a
staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will
take him to a television appearance.
   As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from his
desk, saying ``that's too casual for someone trying to change world
history.''
   He adds, chuckling: ``It's comical, really. I think God has a
sense of humor. Don't you think it's rather funny that a former used
car salesman is heading such a movement?''

<HEAD>Crusading African Editor Targets Corrupt Politicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a continent where newspapers are not
generally known for their crusading zeal, a Zimbabwean editor has
become a national hero and his tabloid a sellout for exposing
high-level corruption.
   The price for Geoff Nyarota's principles has been high.
   A Cabinet minister threatened him with detention. Two of his
staff were allegedly assaulted by a senior politician, and President
Robert Mugabe branded two of his reporters enemies of the country.
   But Nyarota, editor of The Chronicle in Zimbabwe's second largest
city, Bulawayo, remains unbowed.
   ``Where corruption exists, at whatever level, and we find out,
we'll expose it,'' said the 37-year-old editor, a former
schoolteacher who broke into journalism with a muck-raking weekly
newspaper in the l970s.
   The Chronicle's exposes are small change in Africa, where
widespread graft infects most levels of society. But the stories are
avidly read by Zimbabweans who have long suspected some of their
leaders of dipping into the national till.
   In December, The Chronicle published the names of several Cabinet
members, security chiefs and ranking bureaucrats who obtained cars
and trucks directly from the state-run Willowvale assembly plant,
then evidently resold them at a huge profit.
   The Chronicle's front-page report was headlined ``Willowgate
Scandal.''
   Private buyers who order cars must wait years for them, and the
demand has created a flourishing black market in which vehicles
fetch as much as five times their book value.
   Defense Minister Enos Nkala was one of those questioned by The
Chronicle's assistant editor, Davison Maruziva, on the whereabouts
of a car he bought.
   Nkala demanded to know how the paper knew he had the vehicle, and
he threatened to send soldiers to detain Maruziva and his boss.
   ``Where did you get that information?'' the minister reportedly
asked.
   ``That information is supposed to be with the police and the
president. I want that information here in my office ... If you do
not travel here I will use the army to pick you up ... I am not the
kind to play with.''
   Two days later, most of The Chronicle's front page was devoted to
further details of Willowgate.
   The Chronicle, owned like all other daily and Sunday newspapers
in Zimbabwe by the government-controlled Mass Media Trust, also
quoted the defense minister as saying he and other politicians were
considering suing for libel.
   ``Nyarota keeps pestering ministers, wanting to know whether we
still have our cars,'' Nkala was quoted as saying. ``I am still
angry that I can be pestered by little Nyarota.''
   The Chronicle, usually 12 pages printed on a 50-year-old press,
has an average daily paid circulation of 65,000 mainly in the
Matabeleland Province of western Zimbabwe.
   For the issue that splashed the first Willowgate report, the
press worked overtime to produce 100,000 copies. All of them quickly
sold out.
   The Herald, the only daily published in the capital of Harare,
has a nationwide circulation of 135,000, but many readers say it
lacks the bite of The Chronicle.
   The 4,000 copies of The Chronicle sent each day to Harare, 275
miles away, are quickly snatched up from street vendors. Some
entrepreneurs photocopy the paper and sell it in Harare's markets,
bus stations and suburbs.
   Chronicle editors say they could sell thousands more copies in
Matabeland and in Harare were it not for a newsprint shortage.
   Zimbabweans have reacted angrily to reports of corruption by
leaders popularly elected on unfulfilled promises of giving
Zimbabwe's 8.2 million people a fair share of the public pie.
   Thousands of university students, protesting mounting reports of
official graft, clashed violently with riot police in October.
   Trade unions, church groups and individual readers have bombarded
Chronicle editors with statements and letters demanding independent
investigations into the source of some politicians' wealth. Many
live in opulence beyond their means.
   ``That you are courageous enough to ignore the threats against
you, for exposing massive corruption, is something the public has
long waited for,'' wrote one reader. ``For our leaders to deplore
the muzzling of the press in South Africa, and yet advocate locking
you up, is a clear example of the sheer hypocrisy we are witness to
daily.''

   For students working in a miniature factory at
the University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business is
now.
   ``When our students go into industry, they will have
state-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions about
expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the
workplace, said Sema Alptekin, designer of the futuristic business
laboratory.
   Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs
the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging
laboratory.
   The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the
only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced
such programs in the country.
   Tom Akas of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers said Ms.
Alptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... Students
can see how the factory of the future operates.''
   The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms.
Alptekin as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer.
   In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from
storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent,
4-foot metal sentry. The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on a
pivoting base. The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and
turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. The
robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe
or milling machine.
   The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court. The
machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting
shops, Ms. Alptekin said.
   Students learn to program a computer and automated machines
linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation _ retrieving raw
materials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed to
supply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing the
parts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into
finished products at the lathe.
   Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key
chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.
   But the product is less important than the process. Ms. Alptekin
said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation
and financial consulting.
   In the factory of the future, according to the university's
model, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines.
   ``Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. Alptekin
said, referring to programming that allows components such as the
automated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controls
the manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of
parts.
   Ms. Alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even
from industries where robots and automated machines have become
almost commonplace. There, she said, robots perform specific tasks
in ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible
for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the
production line.
   Ms. Alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile
industry, but she would like to see it expanded.
   ``It should be used in any industry,'' she said. ``It's difficult
to justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can
be easily justified.
   ``At least our students will be aware of the enhancements and
developments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers
and managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.
   A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to
altering it to create a new product. Ms. Alptekin said the student
identified what new production components were necessary and
determined how they could be integrated into the system.
   A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will
allow the system to diagnose itself. The system could be programmed
to recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to
switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled
component, much as human managers would react.
   Graduate student Bob Borchelt said the equipment he is using is
on the cutting edge of manufacturing.
   ``Truthfully, I can't say that I was expecting this level of
expertise,'' he said. ``I know that our lab is one of the best of
its kind in an educational institution.''
   The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on
computing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork.
   ``For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms.
Alptekin said.
   Ms. Alptekin said she is continually fine-tuning the lab. This
past year, the original robot was replaced with one able to perform
more tasks. She now is considering purchasing a robot with vision
sophisticated enough to act as an inspector.
   The university spent $30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987. An
estimated $60,000 to $70,000 was earmarked in 1988.
   International Business Machines Corp. recently pledged $1.2
million in computer equipment and software to the university as part
of an IBM program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across the
country.
   ``Studies show that there's a severe national shortage of
instructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' said
Andy Russell, a spokesman for IBM. ``IBM will benefit because we
will be helping to train the (computer-integrated manufacturing)
workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''

<BYLINE>Once-Powerful Party Deserted by Allies, Repressed by Military
Government

<TEXT>
   Chile's once-powerful Communist Party
finds itself increasingly deserted by the left and sharply repressed
by the right while it pursues revolutionary tactics long abandoned
by other opposition forces.
   Parties once closely aligned with the Communists, including
important sectors of the Socialist Party, are taking pains to
distance themselves from the pro-Moscow group while the country
prepares for an end to 15 years of right-wing military rule.
   Many Socialists spent more than a decade in exile in Western
Europe after the 1973 military coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to
power. Their political views were moderated by reforms in that
region, where socialist groups shed their Leninist tendencies.
   But most Chilean Communists sought refuge in the Soviet Union or
East Germany. Upon their return, they have employed a revolutionary
rhetoric that many ex-comrades find antiquated and offensive.
   ``While Communism is changing around the world, the Chilean party
goes back to 1917 and declares itself pro-Bolshevik,'' Socialist
ex-senator Erich Schnake told The Associated Press. ``That leaves
them entrapped in a political-military apparatus.''
   Schnake was referring to a recent Communist Party document
presented at its first national congress in 19 years. In it, the
party declared: ``Our policy of open rebellion remains in effect.''
   It was a reiteration of a party policy statement in 1983 that
formally proclaimed a strategy of ``popular rebellion'' and ``the
use of legitimate violence and all forms of struggle'' against
Pinochet.
   Schnake participated in a coalition of Socialists, Communists and
other leftist groups led by Salvador Allende, who was elected
president in 1970 and ousted by Pinochet.
   He now calls the Communists ``one of the most difficult things to
explain in Chilean politics today.''
   Jose Sanfuentes, a Communist Party spokesman, objected to
criticism of the Communists' militant stance but admits the strategy
had created some problems with the rest of the opposition.
   ``But we do not feel isolated,'' he insisted. ``We are an
important element in the fight to restore democracy.''
   The country's non-Marxist opposition led a peaceful cmpaign for
Pinochet's defeat in an Oct. 5 referendum, which asked voters
whether the 73-year-old army commander's rule should be extended
until 1997.
   The Communist Party characterized the vote as a farce and
insisted only mass struggle would topple the government. Only after
it appeared evident Pinochet would lose, a few weeks before the
election, did the party come out in favor of a ``no'' vote.
   The Communists were not invited to join thea broad-based
opposition coalition that led the campaign, and they remain
ostracized while the coalition prepares for open elections.
   Socialist Ricardo Lagos, a leader of the coalition, characterized
the Communists' position as ``contradictory.''
   ``They need to clearly define themselves, to the whole country,''
he said. ``The country can't understand a party that says it wants
to become legal and thinks that's compatible with a bunch of kids
attacking a police station.''
   He referred to a recent attack on a rural police outpost in which
one officer was killed. A guerrilla band that claimed responsibility
is widely believed to be related to the Communist Party.
   The government calls the group ``the armed hand of the Communist
Party.''
   Sanfuentes denied his party encourages terrorism and claimed
recent terrorist actions were the work of government security
services to put the blame on the Communists.
   ``We do not want to exclude anybody,'' Lagos said. ``The
Communists want to participate? Very well. Then, let them to adhere
to our strategies.''
   The Communist Party is officially outlawed and has suffered
fierce repression by the military since the coup. Party spokesmen
say 17 members of its central committee and dozens of other party
militants have been killed during military rule.
   Some political analysts contend the repression has contributed to
the party's resistance to reform, by forcing it to function
clandestinely.
   The party convention, expected to last several months, began in
December but was being held secretly for fear of government
sanctions, spokesmen said.
   Some party ``public spokesmen,'' such as Sanfuentes, have
operated more or less openly, however, appearing at public events
and meeting with the news media.
   ``Popular mobilization is still essential to put an end to the
dictatorship,'' Sanfuentes said. The expression ``popular
mobilization'' is used by Communists to describe labor strikes and
street demonstrations.
   Sanfuentes said his party is not immune to changes in communism
around the world, but he claimed that those changes, including
``perestroika'' in the Soviet Union, have been misunderstood by
non-adherents.
   ``They try to show `perestroika' as a reverse for the Russian
Revolution,'' he said. ``That's not so. It's exactly the other way
around. The idea is to rescue the best part of the revolution, to
make more democracy and more socialism.''
   ``In that sense, our party is going through a process of renewal
which is deeply revolutionary,'' Sanfuentes added. ``And that
process has not been prompted by events in other parts of the world
or in other parties, but by the reality in our own country.''

<HEAD>Unbundled Stock Unit Backers Change Marketing Strategy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inventors of the unbundled stock unit are
confident they can tie up enough loose ends for still-unconvinced
investors to make February's planned offering of the new security a
success.
   But the developers who initially pitched the securities as a way
to unlock hidden values in a company by breaking a share of its
stock into three tradable components are now emphasizing the value
of the three pieces as a package.
   Ron Gallatin, the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. executive who
oversaw the development of the unbundled stock unit, insists the new
marketing approach simply reflects an effort to point out what may
have been an underappreciated reason for making the switch from
common stock to unbundled stock unit.
   ``There seems to be no question that long before the important
date, there will be more than enough people comfortable with it'' to
proceed with the offerings, he said.
   The important date may be in early February after the Securities
and Exchange Commission completes its review of the proposal and the
offerings begin.
   Shearson and four clients _ American Express Co., Pfizer Inc.,
Dow Chemical Co. and Sara Lee Corp. _ said Dec. 5 that they planned
to offer shareholders a chance to exchange about $5.6 billion in
common stock for unbundled stock units. The precise exchange ratio
has not been announced, and some investors are pushing to get one
unbundled unit for slightly less than a share of common.
   The unbundled stock unit consists of a 30-year bond paying
interest equal to the company's current dividend, a preferred stock
that will reflect any increase in the dividend and an equity
appreciation certificate that will reflect stock price appreciation
in excess of the bond's stated value.
   It is expected that each of the units will trade separately on
the New York Stock Exchange along with the company's common stock
and a unit that will combine the preferred stock and equity
appreciation certificate.
   The stock exchange recently made a proposal to the SEC that would
allow the issuance of unbundled stock units with certain
restrictions.
   The restrictions include limiting the total outstanding stock
that can be converted into unbundled units to no more than 25
percent. In addition, the voting rights of the remaining
stockholders should not be adversely affected by an exchange of
stock for unbundled units and individual shareholders should be
allowed to swap their shares without a shareholder vote.
   Gallatin said his firm has no objection to the exchange's
recommendations, and noted that each of the four offerings proposed
to date are in compliance.
   Shearson has been briefing institutional investors who are being
counted on to be major participants in the market for unbundled
stock units.
   Among the reservations that some investors have expressed are
that the exchange will be taxable and that unbundled units carry no
voting rights. Some have also questioned how liquid the market for
the new securities will be and have found it difficult to place a
value on the preferred and equity appreciation components of the
unbundled unit.
   Gallatin said the taxability issue should not pose a problem for
tax-exempt investors such as pension funds and may be an incentive
for investors who may have a capital loss rather than a gain. Voting
rights would be restored in the event of a takeover.
   In addition, Gallatin said those trying to place a value on the
various pieces of the unbundled stock unit should consider the
extras in the package as a whole.
   While companies can cut dividends, they are less likely to skip
an interest payment and that is what the dividend becomes after the
share of stock is traded for the unbundled stock unit. The bond has
a face value after 30 years of about 2.5 times the current stock
price with the potential for even more with the equity appreciation
certificate.
   In an analysis of the Pfizer offering, the investment firm
Goldman Sachs & Co. said its experts ``have guardedly assigned a
value of about 5-10 percent of the price of the common to these new
guarantees which might be realized if one were to hold the pieces
for 30 years.''
   But they added that if investors do not consider the value of
these provisions ``attractive enough to offset the lack of common
voting rights and the potential liquidity problem, the offering may
be untenable.''
   Some investors want to wait until the new securities are in the
market.
   In a recent report for the investment firm Oppenheimer & Co.
Inc., analysts Norman Weinger and Michael Metz said ``the jury is
still out on the probable success'' of the new securities and
described initial reaction as mixed.
   But they added, ``Were the reaction of market participants to
remain favorable, the incentive would be strong for other companies
to adopt the proposal.''

<HEAD>ABC Movie Tells Story of Young AIDS Victim's Fight To Attend School</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the ABC movie ``The Ryan White Story,''
look for a scene in a hospital in which the young AIDS victim talks
to a friend named Chad.
   Chad is played by Ryan White, the Indiana youngster who took on
fear, ignorance and the establishment in his determination to go to
school despite being diagnosed as having the deadly acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Chad is a friend who died of AIDS.
   Lukas Haas (``Witness'') plays Ryan. Producer Linda Otto said it
was director John Herzfeld's idea to have Ryan play Chad.
   ``Ryan was a natural,'' she said. ``He just understands. He has a
sixth sense. I loved being around him. He's enriched my life.
   ``He's just turned 17, he drives a car. No one quite understands
why he's fine, but he is. Ryan has determined to do well and have a
good life. The lesson of the movie is overcoming adversity. It's not
about AIDS, although that's what he has.
   ``I didn't want to make a movie about a boy dying of AIDS. I
wanted to make a movie about a kid living with AIDS. Every movie you
see about AIDS, the person dies. Even if Ryan had died I wouldn't
have him die in the movie. But I knew he wouldn't die. I knew he'd
hang in there.''
   At the end of the movie, which ABC broadcasts Monday, there is
another look at Ryan, plus his mother, Jeanne, and his sister,
Andrea.
   Judith Light plays Ryan's mother, Nikki Cox his sister. George C.
Scott plays his attorney, George Dzundza and Sarah Jessica Parker
his doctor and nurse, Mitchell Ryan and Grace Zabriskie his
grandparents and Peter Scolari an attorney representing the school.
   ``People wanted to be in this movie because it was about Ryan and
about AIDS,'' said Otto. ``We were able to get music from John
Cougar Mellencamp, Michael Jackson and Elton John because they all
knew about Ryan.''
   ``The Ryan White Story'' is a ``feel-good'' movie.
   Ryan is a hemophiliac who learned in 1984 that he had contracted
AIDS through a blood transfusion. His school in Kokomo, Ind., barred
him. Many parents wrongly believed that their children could get the
disease through casual contact with Ryan.
   ``A lot of people were terrified,'' said Otto. ``That's why this
picture is important. You can't get AIDS by casual contact. The fact
that it polarized an entire town is a microcosm of America. Kokomo
is as apple pie as you can get. There were no good people or bad
people. People wanted to protect their children.
   ``Ryan was bound and determined to go to school. They were bound
and determined to keep him out. It could happen in any community.
What made this a special case is that Ryan went public with it. `I
can't go to school? Watch me.'''
   Ryan won a precedent-setting court decision and now attends
school at his new home in Cicero, Ind.
   Otto said it took nearly three years to get the movie made after
the project was dropped by NBC, then picked up by ABC.
   ``That's a long time to care about a movie,'' she said. ``But
more important, I was concerned about Ryan. His health went up and
down. I wanted to get it done so he could be a part of it.
   ``Many people called about the rights to Ryan's story. But nobody
went to Kokomo and said, `I want to make this movie,' except me.
They didn't say yes right away. I sent them tapes of `Adam' and
`Bill','' two other real-life movies she has produced.
   Ryan's story was filmed in North Carolina, the third movie Otto's
Landsburg Co., has made there. The others were ``A Stoning in Fulham
County'' for NBC and ``Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story''
for CBS. Otto is now awaiting word from ABC on another picture to be
filmed there, ``Unspeakable Acts,'' about a child abuse case in
Florida.
   Otto's movie ``Adam'' was about the murder-kidnaping of Adam
Walsh, which caused his father to crusade for a law setting up a
national clearinghouse for missing children, and ``Bill'' was about
a mentally retarded man, played by Mickey Rooney, who was able to
make it on his own.

<HEAD>Sickly Thrift Bailouts: Frenzy of Pre-New Year Deals Raise New
Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bureaucrats think they had good reason
to pop champagne corks early for their success at peddling some of
the sickest insolvent savings and loan institutions before the New
Year holiday.
   But congressional critics think the last laugh may belong to the
slick financiers who bought them, risking little of their own money,
gaining huge tax benefits and controlling a vast new source of
assets.
   Once criticized for moving too sluggishly to solve the nation's
thrift crisis, federal regulators intensified efforts this past week
to sell at least 200 insolvent S&Ls by the end of the year.
   On Wednesday and Thursday alone, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, which regulates the nation's 3,100 savings institutions, sold
22 of the insolvent thrifts it has been forced to take over because
of mismanagement and bad loans.
   They included the first sale of a U.S. thrift to foreign
investors. Pacific USA Holdings Corp., the Texas unit of a Taiwanese
concern, is acquiring eight institutions with assets worth $850
million.
   The bank board's biggest single sale was the American Savings &
Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., with more than $30 billion in
assets, to a group controlled by the Texas takeover strategist,
Robert M. Bass, who will only have to put up $500 million in return
for $1.7 billion of government aid.
   But the costliest to the government was the sale of five
insolvent Texas S&Ls to an investment group headed by New York
takeover strategist Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc.
   For a $315 million investment of its own and $5.1 billion of
federal aid, Perelman's group will obtain control of savings units
with assets of $12.2 billion.
   Part of the last-minute rush to sell sick thrifts was due to tax
law changes that expire Sunday, halving the potential benefits to
buyers.
   But the selling spree has raised new questions about whether the
government is relinquishing too much in its effort to unload the
problem. Concern also has intensified over many of the buyers,
professional financiers who aren't necessarily interested in running
these thrifts but consider them undervalued.
   ``The haste with which you are proceeding may prove to be
short-sighted, irresponsible and ultimately unfair to U.S.
taxpayers,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said in a letter to the
bank board.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, new chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said he intends to hold hearings in January to
scrutinize these deals, especially the two largest bailouts.
   Bank board officials, who toasted the biggest deals with
champagne, defended the massive infusion of money to salvage the
bankrupt S&Ls, saying it would cost taxpayers much more if they were
closed, which would require the government to pay off the depositors.
   They also rejected the other alternative, continuing to run
bankrupt institutions that are losing more money every day.
   Some thrift industry analysts said the situation reflects the
extremely weak bargaining position held by the bank board, which
doesn't have enough money to shut down failed S&Ls and doesn't want
to keep them. In the end, the government may have to settle for
whoever is willing to buy.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _The government's economic statistics suggested a mixed picture
going into 1989. The Commerce Department said U.S. industries will
expand for the seventh straight year, strengthened by demand for
exports and services. But its chief economic forecasting gauge
turned down slightly and home sales hit an 18-month low in November,
suggesting that rising interest rates are dampening growth.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s record $650 million deal to settle
criminal fraud charges began to hurt the company's business. A
federal judge in Boston delayed a Drexel-financed takeover effort of
Prime Computer Co. because of his concerns over the settlement, and
New York City barred the firm from participating in its next bond
sale.
   _American Telephone & Telegraph Co. agreed to buy Paradyne Corp.
for $250 million, a move that reflected the telecommunications
giant's new willingness to acquire other companies rather than
develop new technology on its own. Elsewhere in the takeover
business, Sunshine Mining Co. said it would buy Rexene Corp. for
$865.2 million; Pennwalt Corp. rejected a $698 million offer from
the Centaur Partners investment group; and Avery Inc. said it was
negotiating to sell its Uniroyal Chemical Co. unit to a
management-led investment partnership, a deal potentially worth more
than $800 million.

   Federal regulators, rushing to complete more
sales of insolvent savings and loan associations, defended their
handling of the crisis against charges that the multimillion-dollar
bailouts don't represent the best deals available to the government.
   Officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
the nation's 3,100 S&Ls, insisted Thursday that the cost to the
government of simply closing the institutions and paying off
depositors would far exceed the sales it is arranging, using tax
breaks and direct federal assistance as a lure for private investors.

profit-taking responsible for the few price movements.
   The drop in heating oil prices resulted from an abundance of oil
in the spot market for the distillate, Lebow said.

<HEAD>Avery Discussing Sale of Uniroyal Chemical for More Than $800
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avery Inc. says it is discussing the possible
sale of its Uniroyal Chemical Co. subsidiary to a management-led
investor group for as much as $810 million.
   Avery bought Uniroyal Chemical for more than $700 million from
Uniroyal Inc. in 1986 in hopes of creating a large, multinational
chemical company, Jerry Hostetter, an Avery spokesman, said Thursday.
   However, Avery abandoned the idea early this year after it found
that the plan was too expensive to carry out, he said.
   Avery said in a statement late Thursday that the investor group,
which also includes Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., would pay $240
million to $250 million in cash for Uniroyal Chemical as well as the
assumption of the division's $560 million in debt.
   Avery said that if it reached agreement with the group, the deal
would require the approval of its board, shareholders and
bondholders, and would also require financing commitments. Drexel
would arrange for the financing, Avery said.
   Avery also announced plans earlier this year to dispose of its
coal subsidiary. Without the chemical and coal divisions, ``in
essence, it would only be an investment company,'' Hostetter said.
   He said Avery, with $45 million to $55 million in cash, would
consider other acquisitions or the possible liquidation of the firm.
   Avery's stock closed at $3.18} in over-the-counter trading
Thursday, up 6\ cents from Wednesday.
   Uniroyal Inc. sold off the chemical division along with its other
assets after the company _ at one point one of the world's leading
rubber producers _ went private in a leveraged buyout.
   Uniroyal Chemical had 1988 sales of $734.2 million, up from
$590.5 million last year, Avery said.

<HEAD>Coors Brings Back Old Label To Appease Disgruntled Beer Drinkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. has learned what happens when you
change the label of the flagship beer but don't change the
ingredients: some beer drinkers are convinced it just doesn't taste
the same.
   Last summer, Coors put a new ``Original Draft'' label on its
flagship beer to attract younger drinkers and compete with Miller
Brewing Co.'s successful draft beer advertising campaign.
   But some beer drinkers in El Paso, Texas, and Southern California
_ two Coors loyalist strongholds _ thought the retirement of the old
``Banquet Beer'' label meant the beer had changed, although it
hadn't.
   Sales fell in some liquor stores and taverns as cans and bottles
bearing the old ``Banquet Beer'' label gave way to ``Original
Draft.''
   ``We thought the change would help us, but it kind of
backfired,'' Mark Martinez of the Coors Distributing Co. in El Paso
said Thursday. ``We were talking to the brewery to try to tell them
how much it was hurting us.''
   Coors, battling for a bigger share of the beer market, paid
attention.
   Next week, Coors, will begin selling the beer under the old
``Banquet Beer'' label again in El Paso and Southern California _
alongside its ``Original Draft'' label.
   The Coors experience in some ways recalls Coca-Cola Co.'s
experiment in April 1985, when it replaced its original cola flavor
with a new formulation. The ensuing consumer protest forced
Coca-Cola to bring back the old flavor three months later, renaming
it ``Coca-Cola Classic.''
   ``We were faced with a choice _ argue with the customers and say
it is the same beer, or give them what they wanted,'' Coors
spokesman Doyle Albee said from company headquarters in Golden, a
Denver suburb.
   Coors introduced the ``Original Draft'' label because Miller
Brewing Co. was having success with an advertising campaign that
emphasized its draft beer, Albee said. He said Coors wanted
consumers to know Coors has been putting draft beer in bottles since
1959.
   ``We also found that new graphics could attract perhaps a younger
drinker, in the 21 to 25 age group,'' he said.
   The brewery began bottling the beer under the new label last
July. This fall, Coors officials were surprised to learn they had
some disgruntled customers.
   ``We found there was confusion about whether it was a different
beer,'' said Albee. ``We never in our advertising campaign said this
is the same beer in a new package. Perhaps that added to the
confusion.''
   Albee said Coors asked the company's 600 beer distributors
whether they wanted the old label back. ``The only response was in
Southern California and El Paso. About 20 said they would take
Banquet.''
   Coors has a loyal following in those areas, said Albee, who
thinks the label change was more readily accepted in areas where
Coors has not been available so long. The beer has been sold in
Southern California since 1937, and in southwest Texas since 1948.
   Martinez said that in El Paso, the label change was especially
unpopular with Hispanics over 40, who form the core of El Paso Coors
drinkers.
   Albee said it will not cost the brewery extra to put two kinds of
labels on its bottles and cans. ``After running out a few thousand
cases, you break about even,'' he said.
   He thinks that while Coors lost some business with the label
change in a few locations, the ``Original Draft'' label already is
building a following that could increase sales.
   And Coors does not plan to change its advertising campaign
because of diehard ``Banquet Beer'' label fans.
   ``Ninety-some-odd percent of our business is Original Draft
(labels) and will continue to be,'' said Albee.

   In a major blow to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
the man appointed to investigate a widening scandal resigned today
after saying he had accepted political donations from the company at
the center of the controversy.
   Takeshita today named a political outsider, former Supreme Court
Judge Masami Takatsuji, 78, to replace Justice Minister Takashi
Hasegawa.
   Hasegawa announced he was stepping down just three days after
Takeshita appointed him to a new Cabinet supposedly untainted by a
stock-dealing scandal that had already forced the resignation of 17
politicians and business leaders.
   Opposition parties and analysts say Takeshita should follow the
lead of those leaders and resign.
   Hasegawa's resignation, which occurred the day after Takeshita
publicly reaffirmed his support for him, was the second Cabinet
casualty. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa stepped down on Dec. 9.
   Takeshita made no comment on the resignation of Hasegawa, 76.
   Takatsuji, a constitutional expert and former bureaucrat, served
as a Supreme Court justice from 1973 to 1980. He is an unusual
choice as a Cabinet member because he is not a career politician,
the background of nearly all Cabinet ministers.
   Takeshita apparently decided it was necessary to go outside
politics to find someone without links to the Recruit Co., the
information conglomerate at the heart of the scandal over charges it
sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary to scores of politicians and
business leaders at bargain prices.
   Asked at a news conference today if he had any connection to the
Recruit affair, the new justice minister said: ``None at all.''
   ``I don't really have anything to say about Recruit,'' Takatsuji
said. ``My attitude toward it is no different from that of the
people in general.''
   His predecessor had been given a mandate to reform political
ethics and head the legal probe of the Recruit scandal. But one day
after Hasegawa's appointment, it was disclosed that Recruit had
given money for 12 years to a group that financed his campaign and
political activities.
   ``There is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donations
made from the good will of their supporters,'' Hasegawa told
reporters earlier today.
   ``However, as minister in charge of clearing up the Recruit
problem in the Takeshita administration, which is trying to heighten
trust in government, it is regrettable that I received donations
from Recruit,'' he said.
   ``I apologize deeply and resign from my post as justice
minister.''
   The scandal has engulfed the Liberal Democrats, as several senior
party lawmakers or their aides purchased shares in the subsidiary
before the shares were offered publicly and later sold them at large
tax-free profits.
   The transactions were legal but have generated a storm of
controversy over business and political ethics. Prosecutors also are
invesigating possible bribery.
   Leaders of the opposition Clean Government Party and the
Democratic Socialist Party said Hasegawa's resignation was only
natural, while the Communist Party called for the entire Cabinet to
resign and new parliamentary elections.
   ``Takeshita should step down because he is connected to the
Recruit affair himself and as long as he is appointing Cabinet
ministers, government won't be clean,'' said Masayuki Fukuoka, a
professor of political science at Komazawa University in Tokyo.
   ``There is no way for the Takeshita administration to regain its
public support as more people will probably be arrested as the
Recruit investigation advances next year,'' he said.
   It is widely perceived that the premier should consider resigning
when public support dips below 20 percent, Fukuoka said.
   A newspaper poll this month found Takeshita's public support was
18 percent, down from 30 percent when he took office 13 months ago.
   An aide to Takeshita and one of his relatives also profited in
the stock transactions, but the prime minister has denied any
personal involvement.
   ``Takeshita cannot escape the responsibility of political reform
that he has pledged, and he should resign,'' said Jiro Kamijima,
professor of government at Tokyo's Rissho University.
   ``The entire parliament has been hijacked (by Recruit).''
   Hasegawa confirmed Thursday that his political support
organization received $46,000 from Recruit over the last 12 years,
but Hasegawa said he had no knowledge of the donations.
   Other new Cabinet members have received donations from Recruit,
including the agriculture and economic planning agency chiefs and
Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, who has acknowledged his
political support group received monthly donations of $160 from
Recruit.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief gauge of future economic
activity edged down 0.2 percent in November, after having risen in
the previous month, the Commerce Department said today.
   The performance by the department's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators continued a sawtooth pattern which analysts said was
signaling that economic growth will slow in the new year, but the
country should not topple into a recession.
   The index had risen 0.4 percent in October after having suffered
a 0.3 percent decline in September. Since May, the index has
exhibited an alternating pattern of increases and declines in each
month.
   Over the past 12 months, the index has risen 1.6 percent, less
than half the 4.1 percent increase of the previous 12-month period.
   To many analysts this suggests that economic growth will be
slower in 1989 but there should be no recession. The traditional
signal of an economic downturn is three consecutive months of
declines in the leading index.
   While the overall economy, as measured by the gross national
product, is expected to climb by 3.9 percent this year, the best
performance in four years, many analysts are predicting growth in
the new year will slow to around 2.5 percent.
   Such a slowdown would have the beneficial effect of easing
inflationary fears, analysts said. With many industries already
operating at close to peak capacity and with unemployment near
14-year lows, economists believe that slower growth is needed to
keep the economy from overheating.
   ``We think a little slowdown is useful right now,'' said David
Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.
``The economy has been growing too fast and needs to slow to a more
sustainable pace.''
   In November, four of the available nine indicators contributed to
the decline. The biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery
times on business orders. This is viewed negatively for the future
because it indicates declining demand for products.
   The other negative factors dragging the index down were a fall in
stock prices, an increase in weekly unemployment claims and a
decline in raw materials prices, also viewed as a negative because
it signals falling demand.
   Three indicators made positive contributions, led by an increase
in growth in the money supply. Other positive forces were a rise in
manufacturing orders for consumer goods and an increase in orders
for new plants and equipment.
   Two indicators, building permits and the length of the average
workweek, were unchanged in November.
   The various changes left the index at 193.2 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   The Federal Reserve has been tightening up on credit for much of
this year in a move to dampen demand and keep inflation from
accelerating.
   Even without the credit tightening by the Federal Reserve, many
analysts said a slowdown would have occurred anyway because they
expect that business investment and export sales, the two sources of
strength in 1988, cannot continue growing at the same rates in 1989.
   Those two sectors of the economy were responsible for half of all
growth in 1988.
   The Commerce Department on Thursday said it was projecting a
somewhat slower demand for U.S. manufactured goods in its annual
U.S. Industrial Outlook, based on the expectation that U.S. exports
and capital spending will not rise at the same breakneck pace in the
new year.
   The outlook forecast that 70 percent of all manufacturing
companies would enjoy rising sales in the new year, down from a
decade-high level of 82 percent in 1988.

   Stocks ended the final trading session of the year

   Traders said several of the leading stocks that had increased due
to the rise in the dollar switched and headed lower in tandem with
the U.S. currency.

<HEAD>Government Will Inject $2 Billion into Troubled Automaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to proceed with a $2
billion capital injection for Renault, the state-owned automaker,
the Industry Ministry announced Friday.
   The widely expected announcement was the latest development in a
dispute between France and the European Economic Community over
France's plans to make Renault solvent by easing its debt burden.
   The EEC's executive commission wants Renault operated as a normal
company rather than a government authority. The French agree but
want to make sure they can continue to finance the company.
   In an apparent effort to placate the commission, the Industry
Ministry published a decree Friday saying Renault would be run in
accordance with Article 241 of France's 1966 corporate legal code.
   The decree gives government decisions the same status as a vote
by a general shareholders meeting, since the state is the group's
only shareholder. This, in turn, means that a capital boost approved
by the state has the same legal status as one approved by
shareholders of a private-sector company.
   Renault lost $5 billion between 1981 and 1986, and by the end of
1987 its liabilities amounted to $7.7 billion, almost $2 billion
more than its assets.

   The national trade surplus with the
United States in the first 11 months of this year decreased to $7.61
billion, down $890 million from a year ago, the Korea Foreign Trade
Association reported Friday.
   Under American pressure, Korea has eased import curbs and taken
other steps in efforts to reduce the trade excess.
   The association listed Korean exports to the United States in the
January-November period at $19.06 billion, up 16.5 percent from a
year ago, and imports from the United States at $11.45 billion
dollars, up 45.7 percent.
   In November alone, Korea recorded a surplus of $782 million with
the United States, an increase of $7 million from a year ago,
officials said.
   They said Korea's trade deficit with Japan in the first 11 months
of this year shrank to about $3.58 billion, down $1.285 billion from
the same period last year.
   Korean exports to Japan during the period soared 45.3 percent
from a year ago to $10.86 billion while imports from Japan rose 17.1
percent to $14.44 billion.
   However, Korea's trade deficit with Japan in November alone
widened to $364 million from $338 million a year earlier.

   Stock prices moved higher in quiet dealings early
today, as the market's best-known index made a bid to finish the
year at its highest level since the October 1987 market crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has risen 20
points over the past two sessions, was up 4.28 at 2,186.96 after 30
minutes of trading.
   The Dow Jones industrial average's highest close for 1988 is
2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21, also the highest close since the
October 1987 crash.
   Advancing issues took the lead over losers by a margin of 5 to 4
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 507 up, 433
down and 586 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 20.02 million shares at 10 a.m. on Wall
Street, compared with 19.95 million shares at the same point on
Thursday.
   As the market headed into its final trading session of the year,
the Dow Jones industrial average was about 12.6 percent above its
1987 close.
   Trading was expected to be relatively light today as many
investors take an early leave for the New Year holiday weekend.
   Market watchers said the light volume could exaggerate the price
swings and that last-minute efforts to adjust end-of-year investment
portfolios could distort the day's activity.
   In economic news today, the Commerce Department reported that its
Index of Leading Indicators fell 0.2 percent in November.
   But the government also revised upward its estimate of the
October gain in the leading indicators to a 0.4 percent rise rather
than the 0.1 percent increase originally reported.
   Among the early actively-traded issues on the NYSE, SCE Corp. was
up [ at 32{, Pacificorp was unchanged at 35\ and Rochester Gas &
Electric was up [ at 17].
   Quantum Chemical was down } at 106{ after gaining more than 18
over the past two sessions in the wake of its announcement of a
recapitalization plan.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.13 at 157.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.40 at 303.29.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.25 to
2,182.68.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
987 up, 477 down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.29 million
shares, up from 110.63 million in Wednesday's session.

<HEAD>Judge Restrains Takeover Effort, Cites Drexel Case As One Reason</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's decision stalling a $970 million
takeover effort is based on concerns about the deal's huge debt
financing and criminal sanctions hanging over its investment banker,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The order by U.S. District Judge David Mazzone late Thursday came
hours before MAI Basic Four Inc.'s $20-a-share bid for Prime
Computer Inc. was due to expire. MAI Basic extended the bid until
Jan. 11.
   Mazzone's ruling appeared to be the first time that concern over
Drexel's record settlement of securities fraud charges announced
last week had affected litigation in a hostile takeover fight.
   Mazzone said he wanted more information from Tustin, Calif.-based
MAI Basic, which is about one fourth the size of Prime, involving
``the ambitious, fragile and possibly illegal financial requirements
through which (it and other investors) propose to acquire Prime.''
   The judge said MAI Basic, controlled by New York financier
Bennett S. LeBow, and its investment banker Drexel, are proposing a
deal that will cost a total of $1.5 billion with ``virtually all of
this financing (taking) the form of debt.''
   Of the $1.5 billion, $875 million would be in the form of junk
bond financing from Drexel, which Mazzone noted has ``acknowledged
its guilt to six felony counts related to its involvement in
similarly heavily leveraged transactions.''
   ``Suggestions that Drexel's guilty plea improves its financial
stability, while not necessarily disingenuous, are not helpful,''
Mazzone said.
   Prime stock closed at $17.75, up 37.5 cents, in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading Thursday.
   Matthew Eluck, an attorney for MAI Basic, said he was optimistic
MAI Basic would address some of Mazzone's concerns about financial
disclosures and that MAI Basic would be able to satisfy his latest
concerns.
   The judge also said MAI Basic's offer requires the Delaware
courts to strike down Prime's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan or
for Prime's board to rescind it, which is unlikely. Prime is
headquartered in Massachusetts but incorporated in Delaware.
   ``The bidders acknowledge that the poison pill makes Prime
prohibitively expensive,'' Mazzone said. ``Yet, despite a Delaware
court decision refusing to enjoin the plan, the bidders continue to
assert with confidence that they can consummate the deal.''
   Eluck said MAI Basic intended to pursue efforts in the Delaware
courts aimed at overturning Prime's poison pill. Under the plan, if
a party acquires more than 20 percent of Prime, current shareholders
are entitled to buy shares at half price.
   Meanwhile, Eluck said MAI Basic would respond promptly to
Mazzone's latest queries for further details of the financing.
   ``We think we will be able to provide them and comply with the
judge's directions for further disclosures by the end of next
week,'' he said.
   Prime said in a statement: ``We are gratified by the district
court's order and its recognition of the serious economic and legal
questions raised by MAI's efforts to acquire Prime.''

<HEAD>Domestic Carmakers Narrow Quality Gap, Marketing Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic carmakers should be able to close
the quality gap with their Japanese and European rivals in the next
five years, auto marketing expert J. David Power III says.
   ``Domestic (manufacturers) as a group are still five years behind
the Japanese, but we're projecting by '93 or '94 we'll have parity
in product quality, at least in consumer perceptions,'' Power,
founder of J.D. Power & Associates, told auto dealers at the
Indianapolis Auto Show.
   Power predicted slightly slowing car sales over the next two
years, followed by a brisk recovery.
   ``We're (projecting) an average of 10.3 million passenger cars
and 4.9 million trucks'' will be sold in each of the next two years,
he said Thursday. ``We see (sales) climbing back by '93 to about 11
million passenger cars and 4.8 million light-duty trucks.''
   He said he does not expect continuing growth in demand for
light-duty trucks, which have given domestic manufacturers a big
lift in recent years.
   ``One thing that concerns me about the truck business is the rosy
projections everyone is giving to it,'' Power said. ``I would
caution the industry ... to be looking at a realistic level of
sales. We cannot sustain a 5 million light-duty truck market
forever.''

   Stock prices turned mostly lower in quiet

its highest closing level since the October 1987 market crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has risen 20
points over the past two sessions, was down 1.79 at 2,180.89 after
90 minutes of trading.
   The Dow Jones industrial average's highest close for 1988 is

the Dow Jones industrial average was about 12.6 percent above its

   Soybean futures prices opened moderately higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in sympathy with a rally in the
soybean meal market, but grain futures were nearly unchanged.
   Volume was light and trading conditions were extremely thin with
many traders getting an early start on the long New Year's weekend.
The exchange was scheduled to close at noon CST and to reopen on
Tuesday.
   Analysts attributed gains in the soy complex to the
lighter-than-expected delivery notices posted today against the
soon-to-expire January soy contracts _ a sign of strong demand.
   But grain traders seemed more concerned about evening up their
positions before the end of the year.
   ``It's not going to be a real exciting day, to say the least,''
said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with the G.H. Miller Division of LIT
America Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to { cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.36} a bushel; corn was \ cent

unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.39{ a bushel; soybeans

   Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed in early trading

   Soybean futures prices surged mightily Friday in
an abbreviated session on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts
for drier weather in South America and more soybean meal purchases
by the Soviet Union.
   Grain futures also advanced.
   Some meteorologists said a high-pressure ridge was forming over
the South American soybean belt, which could mean a return to the
unusually warm, dry conditions that marked the recent planting
period in Brazil and Argentina.
   Additional buying was prompted by rumors that the Soviet Union
planned to buy more U.S. soybean meal, said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``The Soviets are on a very aggressive import program for both
grain and protein in an attempt to improve food supply and

   Federal regulators announced the closings of
two more insolvent savings and loan associations today, pushing the
total for the year to 199 with officials predicting that figure
would climb to a post-Depression record well above 200 before the
year-end rush to complete deals is over.
   The latest sales, involving insolvent S&Ls in Montana and
Oklahoma, were announced at mid-day as the three-member Federal Home
Loan Bank Board continued to meet behind closed doors reviewing
applications to take over failed institutions.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall scheduled a late afternoon
press conference to announce further agreements and to answer
charges raised by critics that many of the multimillion-dollar
bailouts represented bad deals for the government.
   Critics have complained that in its rush to complete sales before
midnight Saturday, when tax breaks for buyers will be cut in half,
the bank board failed to drive the best bargains possible.
   The latest acquisitions involved the sale of the insolvent
Community Federal Savings and Loan Association of Tulsa, Okla., to
the Local Federal Savings and Loan Association of Oklahoma City. The
agreement was te first acquisition under the bank board's Oklahoma
Plan, providing for accelerated review of cases in that state. The
government pledged assistance of $89 million and Local Federal
agreed to invest $16 million in cash.
   In the other deal, the insolvent Great Falls Federal Savings and
Loan Association of Great Falls, Mont., was taken over by Western
Savings and Loan Association of Missoula, Mont. The agreement, in
which the government pledged $11.4 million in assistance, resolved
the final insolvent S&L in Montana.
   The 199 insolvent S&Ls which have been closed compared to 48
closed in 1987 and would be the highest figure since 277 S&Ls failed
in 1938, during the Depression.
   The bank board for the first time has drawn foreign investors
into its effort to bail out sick S&Ls in the Southwest. It announced
a subsidiary of a Taiwanese company had agreed to buy eight
insolvent Texas savings institutions.
   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall defended the sale of the Texas
thrifts to Taiwanese investors, saying, ``We welcome our first
non-U.S. owned investor ... Their interest in investing in the
future of Texas is a further indication of the attractiveness of the
state's thrift industry as well as its business climate.''
   Working against a midnight Saturday deadline, the bank board
announced the sale of 13 more insolvent S&Ls in Texas and Illinois
late Thursday.
   All of the institutions will be open for business as usual today,
sporting new names and with their depositors' funds fully protected.
   Even with the year-end rush of closings, there are still more
than 400 insolvent S&Ls operating, and estimates of cleaning up the
total mess range as high as $112 billion.
   The amount of money needed presents an immediate problem for the
incoming Bush administration.
   President-elect Bush is faced with the task of coming up with a
solution to the S&L crisis that will not make it impossible for him
to meet his campaign pledge of narrowing the federal budget deficit
without resorting to higher taxes.
   Many congressional critics believe that the bank board's efforts
are going in the wrong direction and will worsen not narrow the
ultimate cost to the government.
   Wall has insisted that the cost of simply closing the
institutions and paying off depositors would far exceed the sales
which are being arranged through the use of tax breaks and direct
federal assistance as a lure to buyers.
   The tax benefits to S&L buyers will be effectively cut in half
after midnight Saturday. The provisions that will expire allow firms
purchasing failed S&Ls to deduct the previous losses of those
associations from profits the firms earned on other operations.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the new chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said he plans to hold a series of hearings
starting in January on the deals, looking specifically at the two
largest bailouts announced this week.
   Those complex transactions will cost the government $6.8 billion
in assistance to the purchasers of American Savings of Stockton,
Calif., by Texas billionaire Robert Bass and the acquisition of five
deeply troubled Texas S&Ls by Revlon cosmetics chairman Ronald
Perelman.
   The S&Ls which were closed on Thursday included one institution
in Springfield, Ill., and 12 insolvent S&Ls in Texas which were
purchased by two separate groups of investors, including the first
sale of Texas institutions to foreigners.
   The details of the transactions were:
   _Eight insolvent Texas S&Ls were sold to Pacific USA Holdings
Corp., a Texas subsidiary of Pacific Electric Wire and Cable Co. of
Taiwan, which agreed to invest $37.5 million. The branches will be
operated under the name Pacific Southwest Savings Bank F.S.B.,
headquartered in Corpus Christi. The bank board agreed to provide
$566.2 million in government assistance to the purchasers.
   The S&Ls being taken over were Charter Savings and Loan of Corpus
Christi; Keystone Savings and Loan of Lampasas; Bayview Federal
Savings Association of Corpus Christi; First Federal Savings and
Loan of Luling; Independence Savings and Loan of Gonzales; Yoakum
Federal Savings and Loan of Yoakum; Union Savings Association of San
Antonio; and Sequin Savings Association of Sequin.
   _Four insolvent Texas thrifts were purchased by the Centex Corp.,
a Dallas home builder, who will operate the former branches as Texas
Trust Savings Bank F.S.B. In that transaction, the bank board will
provide $429 million in government assistance and Centex will invest
$26.5 million.
   The insolvent S&Ls purchased by Centex were Burnet Savings and
Loan of Burnet; Lee Savings Association of Giddings; Ranchers
Savings Association of Johnson City; and Peoples Savings and Loan of
Llano.
   _The insolvent American Savings Bank of Springfield, Ill., was
acquired by Citizens Federal Bank of Miami, which will operate
American's 23 offices as branches of Citizens Federal. The takeover
will cost the government $187.9 million. Citizens Federal invested
no money in the deal.

<HEAD>A Volatile Year For Interest Rates</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The interest rate forecast for 1988 turned out to
be a bit like a long-range weather report, with few experts
accurately predicting what was in store for the borrowing public.
   ``Everyone was thrown for a loop,'' said Jay Goldinger, a
principal of the Hollywood, Calif., investment banking firm Capital
Insight Inc. ``It was a year that frustrated many.''
   Consumers and businesses generally saw short-term interest rates
soar while longer-term rates were little changed from the previous
year, a mixed blessing for both groups.
   As a result, the so-called yield curve, which illustrates the
difference between short- and long rates in the bond market, took an
unusual turn in 1988. First it flattened from the normal upward
slope, then started to invert for the first time in about six years.
   ``I think if you were to try to isolate one key factor of the
1988 fixed-income environment it was the pronounced flattening of
the yield curve,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of
money-market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   On the last day of trading in 1988, for instance, the yield on
the one-year Treasury bill was slightly higher than that of the
bellwether 30-year bond, 9.00 percent vs. 8.98 percent. The
3-month-bill yield was still 0.64 percentage points lower than the
long bond, although normally the gap is around 2 percentage points.
   Long-term rates usually are significantly higher to compensate
investors for their increased risk. (For instance, it's more likely
that someone will renege on a 30-year debt than on one lasting three
months.)
   The last time the yield curve inverted, the stock market took a
tumble and the nation headed into a recession.
   Few economists, though, are predicting a similar scenario for
1989. In fact, it was fears of the opposite occurring that pushed
short-term rates as high as they are now.
   ``The short-end rise (in rates) came from the Fed tightening,''
said Sullivan.
   At the start of 1988, the Federal Reserve eased its credit
policies by keeping interest rates down, out of near-universal
concern the country was close to a recession from the previous
October's stock market crash.
   But the economy showed surprising resilience. The Fed then
started to worry about rising inflation, along with an unstable
dollar in foreign exchange, and switched gears by tightening credit.
   Inflation actually remained in check throughout the year, which
is partly why long-term interest rates and prices remained fairly
stable, economists said.
   The central bank took its biggest inflation-fighting stand in
August, when it raised the discount rate, the interest charged on
loans to member banks, a half percentage point to 6.5 percent. Other
indirect movements have been made known since.
   Commercial lending rates followed suit. Major banks lowered their
prime lending rates _ used to set rates on most corporate and
consumer loans _ a quarter of a percentage point to 8.5 percent on
Feb. 2, then raised them a half percentage point four times to 10.5
percent by year's end.
   There was a similar pattern for mortgage rates. For a
conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, rates ranged from a low of
9.84 percent in mid-February to a high of 10.77 percent at year's
end, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The interest rate climate didn't have too much effect on the
volume of municipal and corporate issues.
   For the year, the volume of municipal issues totaled around $112
billion, compared with $101.5 billion in 1987. The volume of
corporate issues rose to around $275 billion from $272.19 billion.
   Many economists predict that rates will continue to rise during
the first half of 1989, with the 30-year Treasury bond yielding as
much as 9.5 percent. It was as low as 8.29 percent in February and
as high as 9.45 in August.
   During the second half, interest rates should decline as the
economy starts to cool down, economists predict.
   ``We expect Fed policy next year to be driven primarily by
inflation and inflation expectations,'' said Elliott Platt, an
economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Corp.

   Gold prices recovered. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $410.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
$1.60 from late Thursday, when it lost $5.10 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's weaker tone
Friday largely to comments made by Bundesbank vice president Helmut
Schlesinger in an interview with West German newspaper Die Welt.
   Schlesinger said a further increase in U.S. interest rates could
cause the dollar to rise, making it more difficult for the United
States to reduce its high trade deficit.
   One dealer said the comments had an impact on the market because
they were intperpreted as a call by Schlesinger for a lower dollar
and a firmer mark.
   However, others said that since trading was thin on the last
business day of 1988 some transactions had an exaggerated effect on
rates. Trading also ended a few hours earlier than usual.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.13 yen to close the year at 125.90 yen. In London,
it was quoted at 125.10 yen. Later, in New York, the dollar stood at
124.95 yen, down from 125.625.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8062, compared with $1.7900
Thursday. Sterling fetched $1.8115 in New York, up from $1.7905.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.7770 West German marks, down from 1.7875; 1.4995 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5140; 1.19245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19205;
6.0480 French francs, down from 6.0965; and 1,306.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,315.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.7725
West German marks, down from 1.7875; 1.5025 Swiss francs, down from
1.5125; 6.0600 French francs, down from 6.0975; 2.0020 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0190; 1,305.25 Italian lire, down from
1,314.50; and 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19225.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $410.00 a troy ounce, up from $408.20 late Thursday.
   Gold closed in London at $410.05 an ounce, up from $408.25 late
Thursday. In Zurich, the late bid price was $411.00 an ounce, up
from $410.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.63 to close at a bid $412.44.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver closed at
$6.038 a troy ounce, up from $5.998 Thursday. Silver was quoted in
London at a late bid price of $6.04 an ounce, unchanged from
Thursday.

   The stock market was mixed late today, as
blue-chip issues appeared to fall short in their effort to set a
post-crash closing high even as some secondary issues advanced.
   Five minutes before the close of trading, the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials was off 12.50 at 2,170.18. In the previous
session, it had edged to within a point of its highest close since
the October 1987 crash.
   But advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of nearly 7 to
6 among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 770 up,
697 down and 531 unchanged.

   Koppers Co. Inc. managers on Friday purchased
the company's tar processing, wood preservation and coke operations
from Beazer PLC for more than $200 million.
   The sale is the largest single divestiture of Koppers since
British industrialist Brian C. Beazer acquired the Pittsburgh-based
firm for about $1.8 billion in June, according to Beazer.
   However, Beazer said it was retaining a one-third interest in the
three businesses.
   Beazer also announced the sale of Koppers' 33-story headquarters
building in downtown Pittsburgh to a Miami real estate investment
firm for $45.5 million to United Trust Fund of Miami.
   The businesses sold Friday will be renamed Koppers Industries
Inc. and be headed by Robert K. Wagner, 57, former vice president
and general manager of the Koppers Tar and Wood Products Sector,
officials said.
   Koppers Industries said it expected to have revenue of more than
$400 million in 1989 with 20 plants in the United States and
interests in similar businesses in Australia and Denmark.
   The company will have about 1,900 employees.
   About 100 management investors own about 34 percent of Koppers
Industries' voting stock with the remainder shared equally by Beazer
and Koppers Australia, the company said. Koppers Australia is owned
by Koppers Industries, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. of
Australia and Hickson International PLC of Australia.
   Beazer said the sale of Koppers' assets has reached about $680
million thus far. The company has already sold Koppers' specialty
chemicals division and parts of its construction and construction
materials divisions.
   ``We expect to announce, within the next few months, the final
divestitures of our program,'' Beazer said.
   Proceeds of the sales are being used to pay down debt from the
Koppers acquisition, Beazer said.

   The stock market turned in a mixed performance
today as blue-chip issues sank, failing to sustain a run at a
post-crash closing high and fading as the last session of the year
drew to an end.
   Nonetheless, the market managed to post some sizeable gains for
the year.
   Analysts cited profit-taking in advance of the three-day New
Years holiday weekend, program selling by professional traders, a
rise in oil prices and weakness in the dollar for the stock market's
performance in the final session of 1988.
   ``It's the end of the year, and the last opportunity to sell,''
said Jack Solomon, a market technician for Bear Stearns.
   But Solomon also pointed out that the market had recovered more
ground than many people would have expected at the time of the
October 1987 market crash.
   ``So it ain't all bad,'' he said.
   In economic news today, the Commerce Department reported that its
Index of Leading Indicators fell 0.2 percent in November.
   But the government also revised upward its estimate of the
October gain in the leading indicators to a 0.4 percent rise rather
than the 0.1 percent increase originally reported.

<HEAD>Yearlong Takeover Battle Ends With Formal Approval Of Bank Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's longest and most bitter
takeover battles formally ended Friday _ the last business day of
the year _ with the $1.48 billion merger of Irving Bank Corp. with
Bank of New York Co. Inc.
   The merger was approved by Irving's shareholders at a special
meeting, the Bank of New York said.
   Bank of New York said it expected that the principal banking
subsidiaries of the two holding companies, the Bank of New York and
Irving Trust Co., will be merged in the first half of 1989.
   ``All our efforts will now be directed to forging both
institutions into a major force in U.S. and worldwide banking,'' J.
Carter Bacot, chairman of the merged company, said in a statement.
   The two banks ended a year-long feud Oct. 7, when Irving's board
of directors voted to end its resistance and drop all lawsuits and
anti-takeover measures.
   In return, Bank of New York sweetened its offer by about $200
million by slightly increasing the stock portion of its bid and
adding stock warrants.
   The Federal Reserve Board removed the last formal obstacle to the
merger Nov. 28 by approving the deal. The board originally gave
conditional approval in February, extending it four times as Irving
battled the takeover.
   The merger will nearly double Bank of New York's size, vaulting
it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies.
The two banks had a combined $47.8 billion in assets as of June 30.
   Bank of New York's bid, launched Sept. 25, 1987, was the first
hostile takeover attempt among American banks.

<HEAD>Soybeans End Year With A Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged to a 10-week high Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts of drier weather in the South
American soybean belt and rumors of more soybean meal purchases by
the Soviet Union.
   On other markets, energy futures rose sharply; precious metals
were higher; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Volume was uniformly light in thin trading conditions with many
traders away for the holidays. Most U.S. futures markets closed at
noon local time and will not reopen until Tuesday morning.
   Soybeans settled 7\ cents to 17 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in January at $8.04} a bushel, marking the first
settlement above $8 for a near-month soybean contract since Oct. 19.
   Some meteorologists said a high-pressure ridge was forming over
the central section of South America, which could cause a return to
the unusually warm, dry conditions that marked the recent soybean
planting period in Brazil and Argentina.
   Additional buying was prompted by rumors that the Soviet Union
planned to buy more U.S. soybean meal, said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   A Soviet purchase of at least 600,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean
meal earlier this week surprised traders and boosted optimism about
export sales of U.S. grains.
   ``The Soviets are on a very aggressive import program for both
grain and protein in an attempt to improve food supply and
availabilities,'' Gustafson said.
   Grain futures also closed higher. The wheat market was supported
by a new 90-day forecast for continued dry weather in the central
Great Plains, where winter wheat is grown, Gustafson said.
   Corn was buoyed by spillover buying from the adjacent wheat and
soybean pits, he said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3\ cents higher with March at $4.40 a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with March at $2.84{ a
bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4\ cents higher with March at $2.43} a
bushel.
   Crude oil for February delivery steamed through psychological
resistance at $17 a barrel and soared all the way to $17.30 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange before late profit-taking cut the gains.
   ``When it got past $17.15, a cold sweat gripped the shorts
(players who had bet that prices would fall) and they started to
buy,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New
York. ``It was a real buying frenzy in there.''
   The rally was almost entirely due to chart signals rather than
supply-and-demand factors, he said. But with OPEC's new
oil-production restraints scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, few
players were willing to go home holding short positions, he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 47 cents
higher with February at $17.24 a barrel; heating oil settled .50
cent to .84 cent higher with January at 53.48 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .77 cent to 1.05 cents higher with January at
47.88 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures rose modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange in a technical rebound after declining in each of the three
previous sessions.
   Platinum futures advanced slightly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, but analysts were not encouraged by the rise in prices.
   ``Going into the new year, I've got to say the trend is a bit
down,'' said Richard Levine, a vice president of precious metals and
foreign exchange trading with Elders Futures.
   Gold settled $1.80 higher across the board with February at
$412.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 4 cents higher with
March at $6.13 a troy ounce; platinum was 80 cents to $2.30 higher
with January at $516.60 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in thin, directionless holiday trading.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February
at 73.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .07 cent
higher with January at 84.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent
lower to .03 cent higher with February at 46.52 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .55 cent higher with
February at 43.05 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.70 points lower at 280.40. Each point is worth $500.

   Bond prices rose slightly in thin, pre-holiday
trading Friday, leaving the yield on the widely watched long-term
Treasury issue unchanged compared with its level a year ago.
   The bellwether 30-year bond ended the year up around [ point, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to
price and is often seen as a signal of interest rate trends, fell to
8.98 percent from 9.00 percent late Thursday. The 30-year bond's
yield ended 1987 at 8.98 percent as well.
   The market was described as extremely quiet, with trading ending
earlier than usual in advance of the New Year's Day holiday.
   Analysts said there were little price movements and the market
virtually ignored government reports showing a 0.2 percent drop in
November leading indicators and an 8 percent decline in November
single family home sales.
   In the secondary market for outstanding Treasury bonds and notes,
prices of short-term governments rose between 1-32 point and 5-32
point, intermediate maturities rose around 5-16 point and long-term
issues ranged from 1-32 point lower to \ point higher, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a business-information service.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was up 1.36 at 1,233.05. The index
finished 1987 at 1,154.88.
   In corporate trading prices also strengthened marginally. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.13 to 293.95, putting it substantially ahead of its
closing 1987 level of 268.41.
   Meanwhile, yields on outstanding three-month Treasury bills
dropped to 8.36 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to 8.09
percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.61 percent as the
discount declined 5 basis points to 8.17 percent. Yields on one-year
bills dropped to 9.00 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to
8.34 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the ace
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8} percent, down from 9{ percent late Thursday. The
higher rate on Thursday reflected yearend demand for extra capital
reserves.

<HEAD>Small Investors' Portfolios Gained 10 Percent In 1988, Magazine
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite predictions of gloom following the stock
market crash of October 1987, Money magazine's small investor index
recorded a 10 percent gain in 1988, the magazine says.
   The gain raised the value of the typical household's portfolio
from $70,956 to $78,019, the magazine said.
   The magazine's index is based on figures on individual investment
supplied by many sources, including the Federal Reserve Bank,
various investment houses and newsletters that follow the investment
field. Its household figure is derived by dividing the total amount
of individual investment by the number of U.S. households, said
Michael Sivy, a Money senior editor.
   The biggest winners of the year were stocks, especially blue-chip
issues, which racked up gains of 17.9 percent in the index, the
magazine said.
   Municipal bonds recorded an 11.4 percent gain for the year, it
said.
   Low short-term rates at the beginning of 1988 made money-market
funds and certificates of deposit poor performers, returning 6
percent and 8 percent for the year respectively, it said.
   Gold was the year's big loser, down in value 26.6 percent, it
said. But the metal represents less than 1 percent of individuals'
overall investments, it added.

   Blue-chip issues stumbled Friday in their bid to
finish 1988 at the highest levels since the October 1987 crash,
fading steadily in the afternoon as the overall market posted a
mixed finale to a year in which many indicators posted double-digit
gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 20 points in the
previous two sessions to within a point of its highest closing level
since the market crash more than 14 months ago, lost 14.11 points to
close at 2,168.57.
   That left the market's best-known barometer with a decline of
0.36 for the week, but with a gain of 229.74 points, or 11.85
percent, for the year.
   It was also the first year that the Dow Jones industrial average
has finished above the 2,000 mark.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
945 up, 594 down and 466 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 127.21 million
shares, down from 131.29 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 160.65 million shares.
   As the session got underway, the Dow Jones industrials moved
above the year's closing peak of 2,183.50 set on Oct. 21.
   But the index turned lower by midmorning, holding at a slightly
lower level until midafternoon when it began a steady erosion toward
the close.
   Analysts cited profit-taking in advance of the three-day New
Years holiday weekend, program selling by professional traders, a
rise in oil prices and weakness in the dollar for the stock market's
performance.
   ``It's the end of the year, and the last opportunity to sell,''
said ack Solomon, a market technician for Bear Stearns.
   But Solomon also pointed out that the market had recovered more
ground than many people would have expected at the time of the
October 1987 market crash.
   ``All in all, how bad was 1988? It was an up year and if you
scratched anybody during the year, they would have said it was going
down,'' he said.
   The market appeared to shrug off a pair of reports that indicated
a slowing economy.
   The Commerce Department reported that its Index of Leading
Indicators fell 0.2 percent in November, but also revised upward its
estimate of the October gain in the leading indicators to a 0.4
percent rise rather than the 0.1 percent increase originally
reported.
   In a separate report, it said sales of new homes fell by 8
percent in November, the largest setback in 18 months.
   Quantum Chemicals was the most actively-traded issues on the
NYSE, falling 1~ to 105]. The company's stock climbed 18} in the
previous two sessions after announcing a recpaitalization plan that
included a special dividend.
   Anacomp was the second most active issue and was the biggest
percentage loser as it fell 1\ to 6}. The company announced lower
earnings from operations for its fourth fiscal quarter.
   Reebok rose } to 12\ as takeover rumors circulated.
   The automobile stocks fell. General Motors was fell 1} to 83{,
Ford Motor lost 1 to 50{ and Chrysler fell } to 25}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $7.144 billion, or 0.26
percent, in value.
   For the year, the Wilshire index rose $318 billion, or 13.1
percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.64 to 156.26 but finished the week with a 0.20 gain and was up 13
percent from 1987.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 2.12 to 321.26, and S&P's
500-stock composite index lost 1.68 to 277.72.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.33 to 381.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 306.01, up 2.32.

<TEXT>
   The Yorktowne Inc. cabinet-making
subsidiary of Wickes Cos. Inc. has been sold to a management group,
the second of several such sales expected to finance a leveraged
buyout of Wickes.
   Wickes, which announced the sale Friday, didn't reveal the price
paid for the Pennsylvania company.
   Yorktowne, a maker of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, has offices
in Mifflingburg and Red Lion, Pa., and employs 700 people.
   No changes in management or workforce are planned, said Sam
Palazzolo, president of Yorktowne.
   A Yorktowne management group financed by Berkeley International
Capital Corp. is buying the company, Wickes said.
   It is the second element of the diversified company to be sold
since Wickes itself was bought by two New York investor groups,
Wasserstein, Perella Partners and Blackstone Capital Partners. That
deal is valued at $2.7 billion in cash, stock and assumption of
Wickes' debt.
   Last month, Wickes agreed to sell its WCI Financial Corp.
subsidiary to a management-led group for $300 million. Other units

<HEAD>Delaware Judge Blocks Poultry Maker Merger with ConAgra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Poultry giant Tyson Foods Inc. won an
important round Friday in its fight to acquire rival Holly Farms
Corp. for $1.1 billion when a judge blocked the target company from
merging with ConAgra Corp.
   The ruling by a Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett of the Chancery
Court in Delaware, where Holly is incorporated, evidently means
Tyson can proceed with its unsolicited $54-a-share cash tender offer
for the company.
   ``It's a major victory,'' said James B. Blair, counsel for Tyson.
``We are pleased and gratified with the court's decision.''
   Tyson is the nation's biggest poultry producer, ConAgra is No. 2
and Holly is No. 5. Together they control about 30 percent of the
ready-to-cook poultry market in the United States.
   Holly, based in Memphis, Tenn., has been resisting Tyson's
overtures and sought a merger with Omaha-based ConAgra to thwart an
unfriendly takeover. Under that deal, arranged in November, ConAgra
would acquire Tyson in a stock swap valued by securities analysts at
about $995 million.
   Hartnett had been asked by Tyson to set aside Holly' deal with
ConAgra. Tyson contended the target company's directors had not
considered getting the best price for their stockholders.
   Tyson also contended that the Holly's board was influenced by
managers who are unfriendly to Tyson's. Industry analysts have said
a Tyson takeover of Holly would likely lead to management changes at
Holly, while a merger with ConAgra probably would not cause such
turnover.
   ``Apparently, we won the case,'' Blair said from Tyson
headquarters in Springdale. ``We are now going to actively pursue
the acquisition. It means the playing field has been made into an
even ground.''
   Officials for Holly and ConAgra were in meetings and weren't
immediately available for comment.
   Earlier Friday, Tyson extended its tender offer until Jan. 6.
Nearly 3 million of Holly's approximately 20 million shares
outstanding had been tendered, Tyson said.
   Tyson produces more than 2 billion pounds of poultry a year,
ConAgra turns out about 1.5 billion pounds, and Holly Farms
processes about 1.2 billion pounds.
   The court announcement came after the conclusion of nationwide
stock trading. Holly stock closed Friday at $55.62{ per share, up
37{ cents. Tyson closed at $17.25, up 37{ cents. ConAgra closed down
12{ cents, at $29.

<HEAD>Zenith Asks U.S. To Monitor TV Imports</HEAD>

   Zenith Electronics Corp. asked the
government Friday to invoke a never-used law to monitor imports of
televisions made by companies suspected of ``dumping'' in the United
States sets they assembled outside their home countries.
   Zenith, the only remaining U.S.-owned TV maker, said monitoring
by the Commerce Department would discourage foreign TV makers from
evading penalties imposed for selling their products in the United
States at unfairly low prices.
   The request stems from a provision in the 1984 trade law that
permits the Commerce Department to develop a 12-month monitoring
program in certain cases.
   ``We're simply asking the government to enforce the laws on the
books,'' Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said in a statement.
   Commerce Department spokeswoman Claire Buchan said in a telephone
interview that before going ahead with a monitoring program, the
agency would have to find an ``extraordinary pattern of persistent,
injurious dumping'' that was causing a serious problem for the
domestic industry.
   She said the department also would have to decide how to monitor
imports _ a procedure presumably less complex than a full-scale
dumping investigation.
   ``Because it's a statute that's never been applied, it's
something we'll have to look at to determine what is the best way,''
Ms. Buchan said.
   Dumping refers to the sale of products in foreign markets at
unfairly low prices to get rid of excess production or to force
competitors out of business.
   Zenith, based in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, has not had an
annual profit since 1984, largely because of fierce competition from
cheap imports.
   Zenith's 378-page request asks the government to monitor imports
of color TVs, picture tubes and parts from Mexico, Malaysia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the Philippines. Those
countries have assembly plants established by television
manufacturers based in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
   Zenith claims that by assembling television sets in other
countries for export to the United States, the large Asian
television makers are evading anti-dumping duties imposed by the
Commerce Department that raise the prices of Japanese, South Korean
and Taiwanese-made sets at their borders.
   ``Even though a television produced at a Singapore plant may have
a Japanese picture tube and Japanese chassis and essentially is a
Japanese TV set, it's imported into the United States without any
anti-dumping duties assessed,'' said Zenith spokesman John Taylor.
   Anti-dumping provisions for picture tubes also are in place
against Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
   Ordinarily, a dumping investigation is initiated when a company
or industry petitions the Commerce Department _ a cumbersome and
costly process.
   But the 1974 trade law also contains a provision for the Commerce
Department to initiate its own investigation if it determines
through monitoring that dumping is taking place.
   Taylor said Zenith hopes the Commerce Department will
``self-initiate'' an investigation in the latest case.

   A state appeals court upheld a jury verdict
awarding an investor group 20 percent of the stock of the computer
franchise giant ComputerLand Corp. in a case that started with a
$250,000 loan.
   The ruling by the 1st District Court of Appeal, issued late
Thursday, included harsh words for the management as well as the
legal arguments of ComputerLand founder William Millard, who has
been driven from control of the Oakland-based company.
   Millard ``was continuously engaged in a kind of shell game (with
his corporations) whereby one would be informally merged with
another,'' Justice Robert Merrill said in the 3-0 decision.
   Merrill also said Millard kept ``chaotic (and frequently
non-existent) corporate records'' and offered ``speciously
legalistic'' arguments in the appeal that contradicted his claims at
trial.
   The court upheld a jury's findings that the terms of a $250,000
loan to Millard more than 12 years ago, in the early stages of his
venture, included the right to exchange the note for 20 percent of
the stock in Millard's computer business.
   The note was later bought by a group of investors called
MicroVest Corp., which sued ComputerLand after Millard refused to
transfer the stock in 1981.
   In addition to the stock, an Alameda County Superior Court jury
awarded MicroVest $141 million, mostly in punitive damages. The
damages were dropped in December 1985 in a partial settlement which
included Millard's resignation from the board of directors.
   MicroVest lawyer Herbert Hafif on Friday confirmed reports that
the settlement gave the investment group an additional 8.5 percent
of ComputerLand stock, bringing the total to 28.5 percent. He said
he expects the company to make a public stock offering this spring
and estimated the total value of ComputerLand at $500 million.
   The ruling is ``the long-overdue culmination of an unnecessary
legal battle,'' Hafif said. He said Computerland ``is now prospering
after some tough times,'' with new management and continued
operation of a chain of 500 computer stores.
   Millard's lawyer, Shirley Hufstedler, declined comment on the
ruling, saying she had not seen it.
   In appealing the jury verdict, Millard argued that the
stock-conversion feature of the original $250,000 loan applied only
to his original computer company, called IMS, which allegedly went
out of existence after a merger.
   He also said he had agreed orally with one of the original
lenders that the note and stock option would not be transferred to
anyone without Millard's consent.
   The appeals court said Millard did not make those arguments
during the trial, and also said the evidence was to the contrary.
   Not only did IMS evidently remain in existence, Merrill said, but
the loan applied to any of Millard's computer businesses, including
the later-formed ComputerLand. He also said the written loan
agreement, presumably the best evidence of the parties' intentions,
made no reference to any restrictions on transfers, and indicated
the loan could be assigned.
   The court also rejected Millard's argument that MicroVest should
be denied any reward because it was allegedly a ``sham corporation''
formed for the purposes of prosecuting a lawsuit.
   ``The individuals who paid to be a part of Micro@Vest were
investing in the anticipated ownership of the various corporations
in which they believed the conversion option gave MicroVest a 20
percent ownership interest,'' Merrill said. ``This is not the same
thing as selling shares in litigation.''

   Crude oil prices broke through the
psychologically important $17-a-barrel level in a yearend buying
spree.
   Analysts attributed Friday's rally to optimism that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere to its
new production quotas starting Jan. 1.
   The 13-nation cartel agreed in November to slash daily production
to 18.5 million barrels to help prop up sagging worldwide oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, the February contract
for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
rose 43 cents to settle at $17.24 a barrel, after losing 20 cents on
Thursday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Friday,
the January contract for wholesale home heating oil rose 0.71 cent
to 53.48 cents a gallon. The contract declined 0.72 cent on Thursday.
   January wholesale unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.03 cent
Thursday, closed at 47.88 cents a gallon, up 0.87 cent.

   The government's chief economic forecasting gauge edged down 0.2
percent in November, continuing a see-saw pattern that analysts said
portends a slowdown but no recession in 1989.
   The Commerce Department's report Friday on its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators was viewed as good news by some experts, who
said it should ease fears that the economy was growing at a pace
that threatened new inflation.
   The 0.2 percent November decline was the fourth drop in the past
seven months. Since May, the index has alternated between gains and
declines, showing very little forward momentum and suggesting
overall economic growth will slow significantly in 1989.
   In another signal of slower growth, the government reported
Friday that sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in November, the
biggest decline in 18 months. Analysts blamed the setback on rising
mortgage rates likely to further dampen sales in 1989.
   The last government numbers of 1988 had little or no influence
over the financial markets, which closed out the final trading day
of the year with mixed results in light trading.
   Bond prices rose slightly, the dollar weakened marginally against
key currencies and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.11
points to close at 2,168.57, though advancing issues slightly
outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Reagan administration said the setback in the leading index
was nothing to become alarmed over, showing only that the economy
was slowing a bit. The traditional signal for a recession in the
past has been at least three consecutive monthly declines in the
index.
   Private analysts agreed, forecasting that overall economic
growth, as measured by the gross national product, will probably dip
to around 2.5 percent in 1989. That would be down from an expected
growth rate of 3.9 percent in 1988, the economy's best performance
in four years.
