<HEAD>Britain Invented Racism, Black Parlimentarian Says</HEAD>

   Britain ``invented'' racism and was forced
to accept blacks in politics only because they demanded their
rights, the first black woman member of Parliament said Friday.
   In a speech to the 12th Annual Conference of the National
Council for Black Studies, Diane Abbott said she was told blacks
were ``distinctly unelectable'' and received little support from
whites during her campaign.
   Before her election to the House of Commons in 1987, the
Cambridge-educated politician was accused of anti-Semitism and of
supporting only the interests of blacks and women, she said.
   Even colleagues in her own party, the socialist Labor Party,
were not willing to support her against a white incumbent, she said.
   ``It is a common fallacy among Americans to believe Europeans
are nicer than Americans and more liberal than Americans,'' she
said.
   ``Far from Britain being a nicer and more liberal society, the
British invented racism,'' Miss Abbott said. ``They built an empire
on which racism was the organizing principle. I believe Britain is
one of the most fundamentally racist nations on earth.''
   Miss Abbott was ``smeared'' as an anti-Semite, she said, after
refusing requests by Britain's Jewish community to denounce Louis
Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, who has
called Judaism a ``gutter religion.''
   ``I said I wouldn't denounce him because once you, as a black
politician, start jumping through hoops for people it never
stops,'' she said to an applauding crowd of about 150.
   A child of working class immigrants from Jamaica, she has
prevailed because of her belief in her roots, she said.
   ``I believe in black people. I believe in our beauty. I believe
in our strength. I believe in our potential. My career has been
about that.''
   She has also prevailed, she said, because the Labor Party has
needed the black vote.
   ``Nobody could have guessed that (this) black girl ... would
have gone on to take her seat in the mother of Parliament, in the
heart of empire, in the heart of darkness, in the belly of the
beast. ... ,'' she said.
   The conference, sponsored by three Pennsylvania universities,
aims to develop ways to allow others to see the world from an
African perspective, according to Kariamu Welsh, assistant
professor of African Studies at Temple University.

   Cher may not win the Best Actress award at
Monday night's Academy Awards, but she already has been rated as
having the best public image among the five nominees.
   Cher was given a 9.9 on a 10-point image scale by Daniel
Eastman, a former Hollywood skin care and makeup expert.
   ``For nine years I have rated the nominees on style,
personality, character, even the way they walk and talk in
public,'' Eastman said. ``A good self and public image is your most
valuable asset, whether you're a waiter, banker, housewife, or
shooting for `Best Actress.'''
   Eastman rated Meryl Streep at 9.7; Glenn Close, 9.5; Sally
Kirkland, 9.2; and Holly Hunter, 9.0.

   The only woman to enter a Jim and Tammy
Bakker lookalike contest walked away with the three top prizes,
including an air-conditioned doghouse.
   Linda Brewer, 43, of High Point won the contest Friday at the
Charlotte Motor Speedway near the former PTL leader's old stomping
grounds, said public relations director Tom Cotter.
   Besides the doghouse _ a replica of the one built for the
Bakkers' pooch _ Brewer also won a trip to Los Vegas and a
gold-plated faucet.
   Although Brewer won by default, she probably would have given
all challengers a good run for the money. Not only did she resemble
Tammy Bakker, she spent two hours Friday morning putting on thick
eyelashes and mascara.
   Brewer, a beauty salon owner, also stuffed sweat socks in her
bra and brought along an onion in a vain effort to force out some
tears.
   ``My mistake was I bought a sweet onion,'' she said.

   Comedian Robin Williams labeled the
Grande Ole Opry House ``the Sistine Chapel built by Black and
Decker'' and took a jab at the state's portly governor during a
benefit performance for the American Cancer Society.
   Williams, making his first visit to Tennessee, joined Opry star
Minnie Pearl and musicians James Taylor and Amy Grant for the show
Thursday night.
   Williams, the frenetic comedian whose performance in ``Good
Morning, Vietnam'' is nominated for an Oscar, went into the
audience to offer Gov. Ned McWherter some vanilla wafers _ the
governor's favorite snack _ as a peace offering.
   Williams joked that the inlaid section of the Opry stage taken
from the floor of the original Opry, Ryman Auditorium, was a
country music Twilight Zone.
   Stepping onto the inlay, he parodied country lyrics, singing,
``Don't care about atomic emissions, C'mon darlin', let's go
nuclear fission.''

   Irish playwright Samuel Beckett has
threatened to sue a Dutch actors troupe if it persists in a plan to
stage his play ``Waiting for Godot'' with an all-female cast, the
play's producer said.
   Beckett made the threat two weeks ago in a telegram to the
Theater Barn troupe in this western Dutch city, where the
production of the 1952 play is scheduled to open Thursday, producer
Ina Otten said Friday.
   Beckett gave no reasons for his disapproval in the telegram, Ms.
Otten said. The 82-year old playwright could not immediately be
reached for comment at his French home.
   ``We're putting the play on just the way Beckett says it should
be done, except we're using women,'' Ms. Otten told the Associated
Press. She maintained the play would go ahead as scheduled despite
Beckett's threat.
   ``Wating For Godot,'' which calls for an all-male cast of four,
is an absurdist classic widely regarded as the central metaphors
for the philosophy of existentialism.

   Former first lady Betty Ford, still
recovering from heart bypass surgery last year, marked her 70th
birthday with a small party, her secretary said.
   ``Her husband is giving a party for her this evening with a few
friends and family,'' Ann Cullen said Friday.
   Mrs. Ford underwent bypass surgery in November, but returned to
the hospital in December because of complications. She was released
from Eisenhower Medical Center on Jan. 3.
   ``She is feeling very well, taking things a little slowly but
pretty much back to normal,'' Ms. Cullen said.
   Ms. Cullen said Mrs. Ford planned to spend Friday ``sitting at
her desk, working on the day-to-day operation of the Betty Ford
Center,'' a drug and alcohol dependency clinic she founded in 1982.

   Fawn Hall, who made her television debut
testifying about former boss Oliver North before a Senate
committee, will be co-host of a network special about fashionable
people.
   Miss Hall was chosen ``because she is very spontaneous and has a
presence that is indicative she can handle this kind of assignment
with zest and energy,'' Gary Pudney, an ABC television executive,
said Friday.
   ``M-W Men and Women,'' based upon M and W magazines, will air
the first week in June. Pudney said it is to combine
``Entertainment Tonight,'' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Lifestyles of the
Rich and Famous.''
   The other co-hosts are Ron Reagan, the president's son; actress
Jane Seymour; and Danny Sullivan, the cab-driving Indianapolis 500
winner.
   Miss Hall already has taped her segment for the hourlong show _
an interview with a British heiress who gave it all up to live with
her husband, a Masai warrior, outside of Nairobi, Kenya, in East
Africa.

   When others had given up hope that U.N.-sponsored
talks would produce a peace settlement for Afghanistan, Diego
Cordovez wouldn't call it quits.
   ``It has happened that everybody has given up, except myself,''
said Cordovez, an undersecretary-general of the United Nations who
mediated the indirect peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   ``Not to give up is my duty,'' said the 52-year-old Ecuadoran
lawyer.
   Cordovez said in an interview that the task of mediating the
talks ``requires tremendous physical and mental strength. You
cannot do it unless you're convinced you will succeed.''
   Success seems within reach with all main elements complete in a
package of agreements designed to end the war. The accord is to be
signed next week.
   Cordovez, the son of Ecuadorean politician Luis Cordovez, has
had a string of other trouble-shooting assignments since he joined
the U.N. system as a 27-year-old law graduate of the University of
Chile.
   In 1965, he was in the Dominican Republic, then in the throes of
a civil war, and he went to Bangladesh shortly after it gained
independence after the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War.
   He was the highest-ranking U.N. official to accompany a special
independent mission to Tehran that failed to resolve the U.S.
hostage crisis in February 1980, and he helped settle a dispute
between Malta and Libya over offshore prospecting rights.
   While the Afghanistan talks were under way, he also was involved
in U.N. efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war and was sent to Grenada
after the 1983 U.S. invasion.
   But none of his assignments has posed more of a challenge than
the Geneva talks.
   Cordovez is credited with avoiding an early collapse of the
Afghan negotiations over the issue of face-to-face talks. Pakistan,
which considers Kabul a Soviet puppet, refused direct talks
although it still has a diplomatic mission in the Afghan capital.
   Pakistan represents the Moslem guerrillas fighting the Communist
government in Kabul, which has been backed by an estimated 115,000
Soviet troops. The Afghan and Pakistani negotiators have not spoken
to each other since the talks were launched six years ago.
   Initially, the delegations took turns meeting with Cordovez.
When the Afghans threatened to leave unless they got more
recognition from the Pakistanis, the U.N. diplomat devised the
``proximity'' formula under which both delegations sit in separate
rooms in the Geneva U.N. office, with Cordovez shuttling between
them.
   ``The satisfaction of getting the adversaries to compromise is
fantastic,'' he said. ``The more difficult the problem, the more I
enjoy it.''
   Although known for taking a tough stance, Cordovez also has a
sense of humor. He says he has been ``cracking jokes all the time''
during his meetings with the two sides.
   ``A sense of humor is absolutely essential in these
negotiations,'' he said. ``A joke can immediately defuse a
situation.''
   Recently, he was seen limping down a corridor. There was no
accident, a bystander was assured. Cordovez was just illustrating
that the talks were ``limping on.''
   Journalists grabbed their pens when he opened a rare news
conference by saying he had an important announcement.
   ``My name is not spelled with an accent over the `o' and if a
newspaper keeps misspelling it, I will cease buying it.''
   Much of his negotiating strength derives from his ability to
leave his work behind on weekends.
   ``People are forbidden to call me at home and I never call my
assistants,'' said Cordovez, who is married with one son.
   He enjoys an occasional Cuban cigar _ sometimes from Fidel
Castro _ good wine and a good meal.
   Cordovez has termed his assignment ``the most exacting and
rewarding in my life.'' But he adds, ``You cannot do such a thing
twice.''

   Embarrassed managers at a company building a
nuclear-powered hunter submarine for the British navy have ordered
an inquiry into how a large section of the vessel was welded into
position upside down.
   ``I don't think anyone can remember quite such a blunder,'' an
unidentified employee of the Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering
Ltd. in the northwestern town of Barrow told The Daily Telegraph.
   Correcting the mistake to the $446 million Trafalgar-class
submarine, named the Triumph, will cost up to $1.86 million,
according to a trade union leader quoted by the British domestic
news agency Press Association.
   Mike Smith, a spokesman for Vickers, said: ``A section of the
SSN19 (the Triumph) has been welded into an incorrect position. An
investigation is currently under way into how this occurred.
   ``We don't envisage there being any impact on the building
program or the quality standards which apply to this submarine,''
he said.
   Smith refused to say how the mistake occurred. The unidentified
trade union leader told the news agency it was a mistake by
``senior management.''
   Smith said he did not think the welding error would jeopardize
Vickers' bid to win an order to build submarines for the Canadian
navy. Vickers is pursuing the order in the face of competition from
the French company Societe Navigation Atomique
   ``This is a very isolated incident and we will be pressing ahead
with our bid. How much it will cost to put right I don't know, but
the figure of one million pounds ($1.86 million) is ridiculous,''
Smith said.
   Jean-Pierre Lucas, naval attache at the French Embassy, told The
Times of London: ``I have always told the Canadians that the French
submarines are cheaper and will be easier to maintain. But now I
will have to remind them that if they want it the right way up they
had better not look to the British submarine.''
   Press Association said the welding mistake is believed to have
resulted from a change in shipbuilding methods at the Barrow
shipyard.
   The Daily Telegraph quoted workers at Barrow as saying a
cylindrical hull section measuring 20 feet by 30 feet had been
welded in the wrong position. The paper said it would now have to
be ripped out and rewelded, which will take several weeks.
   The Defense Ministry said the problem was Vickers' contractual
responsibility. A ministry statement said: ``The company has
quality control and inspection arrangements to ensure that problems
are identified and rectified at the earliest possible time.''
   The hull of the Triumph is due to be launched in a year and the
vessel is to be completed in 1991. It is the last of six of the
original design of Trafalgar-class submarines being built by
Vickers.
   Nuclear-powered submarines are built in a series of massive
rings designed to withstand the huge pressures on the vessel when
submerged. Each of the rings is slightly thicker at one side, which
means their positioning is crucial.
   The Times reported that signs saying which end is up are glued
to the sections, and either the notice fell off or someone didn't
read it properly, which led to last week's erroneous welding. A
quality control inspector noticed the mistake.
   The Daily Telegraph printed a cartoon showing the Triumph with
its conning tower and periscope on the bottom of the hull instead
of the top. The cartoon had Vickers staff saying: ``Yes, they will
notice.''
   The tabloid newspaper The Sun reported the story under the
headline: ``Sub-Standard.''

<HEAD>Short Credit And Lower Oil Revenues Bring Down Weapons Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt problems and an oil glut have shrunk the
amount some countries can spend on arms, causing the annual value
of worldwide arms imports to drop $16 billion from earlier this
decade, a report says.
   From a plateau of about $50 billion a year from 1981 to 1984,
global arms imports declined to $42 billion in 1985 and $34 billion
in 1986, according to a report issued Friday by the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency.
   ``As late as 1984, the trend in arms imports by developing
nations was sharply up in almost all years, fueled by ambitious
force improvement programs financed in most cases by rising oil
prices and easy credit,'' the agency said.
   Since then, an oil glut has driven down Mideast income and the
Third World's debt problems have made funds for weapons scarce.
Besides, many of the countries that bought all those weapons in the
early 1980s have all the guns, tanks, planes and ammunition they
want, the report said.
   ``A sharp decline in Middle East arms imports in 1985 and 1986
was the main contributor to the decline in the world and
developing-country totals,'' the agency said. ``From their peak in
1984, Middle East imports dropped an average of 24 percent in 1985
and 1986.''
   Despite the drop in arms imports, global military spending rose
in 1986 to $921 billion from $800 billion the previous year.
   During 1985, the last year covered by the country-by-country
arms transfer figures, Iraq topped the list of weapons importers,
buying $4 billion worth of equipment for the war against Iran that
began in 1980.
   Iraq was followed in order by Saudi Arabia, India, Cuba, West
Germany, Iran, Libya, Syria, Egypt and the Soviet Union, which
purchases large amounts of weaponry from its allies in Eastern
Europe.
   The United States, which is being urged by its NATO partners to
buy more weapons from Western Europe, ranked 23rd on the list of
importing nations, with $600 million worth of purchases.
   As it has for many years, the Soviet Union led the list of
international arms sellers. Its transfers totalled $15.3 billion.
The United States was second with $12.3 billion, followed by
France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Italy, Britain, West Germany, China
and East Germany.
   The variety and quality of Soviet and U.S. weapons and the
superpowers' willingness to employ weapons sales ``as a political
instrument, suggest that the two will remain the Third World's
largest suppliers by significant margins for many years to come,''
the report said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge heard arguments for more than an
hour Friday in a suit by the state of Massachusetts challenging the
authority of federal officials to direct the training of the
National Guard in peacetime.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Keeton took the case under
advisement but indicated that he expected to rule promptly.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a Democratic presidential
candidate who opposes the Reagan administration's policies in
Central America, is resisting Washington's orders sending 13
guardsmen to Panama and Honduras late next month.
   Douglas Wilkins, an assistant state attorney general, argued
that the framers of the U.S. Constitution envisioned ``the
militia'' as a citizens' army, allowing the ``genius of the
people'' to exert a democratic influence over the perils posed by a
large standing army.
   He said that in spite of the National Guard's dual federal-state
status Congress did not have the power to set aside the states'
traditional role in training the militia.
   ``The original militia, at least in these parts, was the
minutemen of Lexington and Concord,'' Wilkins said.
   Massachusetts is asking the federal court to overturn a 1986 act
of Congress known as the Montgomery Amendment that says governors
may not withhold their consent for training assignments outside the
United States because of objections to the location, purpose or
schedule of the training.
   Justice Department lawyer Vincent Garvey argued that Congress,
acting in 1933 under the ``army clause'' of the Constitution,
created the National Guard of the United States. When members of
the militia are serving in their federal status, they are part of
that ``federal entity'' and answerable to Congress and the
president.
   From the bench, Keeton asked several questions about the
``militia clause,'' which clause gives Congress power over
organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, ``reserving to the
states respectively ... the authority of training the militia
according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.''
   If the states are to retain their authority over training, he
asked, how can federal officers order a training mission over a
governor's objection?
   Last year, a federal court in Minnesota rejected a suit brought
by Gov. Rudy Perpich seeking to block his state's National Guard
troops from a similar assignment. That case, which Massachusetts
joined as a ``friend of the court,'' is on appeal.
   In late January, after receiving direct orders from Washington,
Dukakis filed a fresh suit in Boston. Dukakis has said that if he
is faced with a lawful order, he will comply when the 13 members of
the 65th Public Affairs Detachment are scheduled to leave for two
weeks in Panama and Honduras on May 28.

   A rebel member of Panama's Defense Forces has
smuggled out a memo detailing the efforts of military strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega to buy thousands of pistols from an American
arms dealer.
   The memo, marked ``urgent'' and ``confidential,'' was sent to
Noriega on April 1 by Leo Wanta, president of AmeriChina Global
Management Group Inc., an arms exporting firm based in Appleton,
Wis.
   The document offered fresh evidence of Noriega's intention to
ride out Panama's prolonged political crisis partly with help of a
large infusion of foreign weapons. A Defense Forces defector said
last month he had helped fly to Panama 94,000 pounds of weapons
from Cuba.
   In what appeared to be a major security breach aimed at blocking
the purchase by his boss, the unidentified officer leaked the memo
to a Panamanian opposition leader. The memo was turned over to The
Associated Press on condition the leader be identified neither by
name nor location.
   Wanta told Noriega in the memo that the supplier of the weapons
had advised that ``they are ready to finalize the delivery'' of the
Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistols made in Belgium.
   The schedule called for the delivery of 5,000 pistols
immediately and 2,000 per month thereafter until ``all units are
delivered.''
   The memo did not specify how many weapons were to be sent all
told. But a previous memo by Wanta, obtained last month by the AP,
said the purchase involved 30,000 pistols, including the 5,000 to
be sent immediately. The list price is $398 each.
   The earlier memo was given to the AP by Panamanian Ambassador
Juan B. Sosa. Wanta had sent a telecopy of the memo to Sosa,
unaware that the envoy had broken with Noriega and continues to
regard ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the country's
constitutional leader. Sosa has refused to relinquish the embassy
to a replacement envoy named by the new government in Panama.
   Wanta sent the April 1 memo directly to Noriega, bypassing the
embassy here. A stamp in the upper left hand corner of the
communication said it was received by the Panamanian Defense Forces
on April 5.
   The pistols are manufactured by Fabrique Nationale, S.A., of
Belgium and are to be delivered from that country to Panama,
according to the memo. The State Department raised the issue late
last month with the Belgian firm, which said that it had not had
contact with anyone from AmeriChina, a U.S. official said.
   The government cannot legally block the sale because the weapons
are not of American origin. The U.S. official, insisting on
anonymity, said AmeriChina has not registered with the U.S.
government, a requirement he said applies to all American arms
dealers.
   Wanta could not be reached for comment. The company phone number
that appeared on the first memo was deleted from the second memo.
The phone has been ``temporarily disconnected,'' according to a
recorded announcement. The only address listed is a post office box.

<HEAD>OSCAR COUNTDOWN: Glamour, Not Glitz, Is Key In Oscar Fashions This
Year</HEAD>

   What the stars are wearing attracts almost as
much attention as what they're winning at the annual Oscar
ceremony, and this year's fashion forecast promises heavy glamour
and romance with only moderate glitz.
   Gone are the pounds of weighty sequins and beads. The 60th
Annual Academy Awards will be the year of showing off legs and the
body in form-fitting silhouettes.
   ``We're pushing glamour like crazy this year,'' designer Bob
Mackie said.
   ``Clothes are much more romantic now, and the awards will
definitely reflect that,'' said Mackie, who with Ray Aghayan is the
official designer of the show to be televised live from the Shrine
Auditorium on Monday.
   Mackie and other local fashion notables say films in 1987 were
loaded with more solid, serious female roles than ever before, and
that will be reflected in how nominees and presenters outfit
themselves.
   Those nominated for Best Actress are Cher for ``Moonstruck,''
Glenn Close for ``Fatal Attraction,'' Holly Hunter for ``Broadcast
News,'' Sally Kirkland for ``Anna'' and Meryl Streep for
``Ironweed.''
   Cher, who was overlooked in the 1986 nominating process for her
role as a biker mom in ``Mask,'' stunned the Oscar audience that
year in a revealing black sequined spider-web dress that once again
made her belly button famous.
   ``I think the navel is definitely out this year,'' said designer
Mr. Blackwell, who puts out an annual list of the worst-dressed
women.
   ``(Cher) wants to give credibility to her acting,'' Blackwell
said. ``I think she'll wear something long and boring, though
she'll probably wear her hair like Medusa.''
   Mackie, who is designing Cher's oufit, said it will be anything
but dull. ``Since she was passed over for a nomination for
``Mask,'' she purposely made a statement to be noticed at the
awards,'' he said. ``She won't be conservative this year. I can
assure you of that.''
   Torie Steele, a Beverly Hills bastion of haute couture, has
increased its stock of designer ``entrance and exit'' gowns for
Oscar night.
   Both American and international collections there are showing
dresses short in front and long in the back in basic black as well
as strong, bright colors such as fuchsia and emerald green, said
Barbara Boettigheimer, president of the Rodeo Drive boutique.
   ``All over glitz is out and real body-hugging dresses are in,''
she said, adding that generally only one of each item is ordered at
the exclusive store to prevent duplication.
   ``Sometimes customers get upset because they fall in love with a
particular dress but we didn't get it in their size,'' said
Bottigheimer, whose outfits run between $3,000 and $7,000.
   ``Avoiding duplication is one thing we can offer our clients.
When they're paying that much for a gown, they want to be sure it's
theirs and theirs alone.''
   Dressy pants are on the hit list this season as well and may be
something to watch for at the awards, said Los Angeles designer
Holly Harp, whose flowing, romantic dresses have graced past Oscar
winners Sally Field and Goldie Hawn.
   ``The people who look best are the ones who dress simple but
still look special,'' Harp said. ``It's sometimes hard to balance.''
   Beverly Hills designer Susanna Chung, who has outfitted Julie
Andrews, Liza Minnelli and Faye Dunaway, says long is defintely
passe.
   ``Women want to show off their legs and their bodies, and the
form-fitting fabrics this season do so very nicely,'' she said.
   Mackie, who has also been commissioned to design outfits for
actresses Sean Young and Joan Chen and independent producer Sherry
Lansing, said some ball gowns may even be in evidence at the
ceremonies.
   ``Sherry told me to make her look like a princess,'' Mackie said
of the former 20th Century Fox Productions president. ``She just
doesn't want to look like a tough studio boss.''

   Former White House political director Lyn
Nofziger expects his conviction and 90-day prison sentence for
illegal lobbying to be reversed, saying the prosecutor made
``mountains out of molehills'' and lied.
   ``I am an honorable man,'' Nofziger told U.S. District Judge
Thomas A. Flannery, who also fined him $30,000 on Friday. ``Like
other honorable people, I have gone through life making mistakes,
doing stupid things. ... But I am not a criminal.''
   He said independent counsel James C. McKay was ``not an
honorable man.''.
   Nofziger, a longtime associate of President Reagan, shook hands
with friends and kissed his wife and other family members after the
sentence was pronounced.
   But he reacted angrily when a reporter asked how he felt about
the sentence, calling the question stupid. ``How do you think I
feel? What do you want me to do, say I feel great?'' he asked.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, issued a statement from their
vacation home in California: ``Lyn Nofziger is a dear friend of
many years and our prayers are with him.''
   Nofziger, 63, said he would not ask Reagan for a pardon because
he was confident the conviction would be overturned on appeal.
Flannery delayed imposition of the prison term and fine until the
appeal is completed.
   ``I thought things were going to go better than they went,''
said Nofziger, expressing surprise at the sentence. His lawyers had
asked that he only be put on probation.
   ``In my heart of hearts, I don't believe I'm going to serve time
because I don't believe a prison sentence is justified even if I
were guilty, and I repeat that I am not guilty,'' he said.
   Still, Nofziger said: ``I do have remorse. I am distressed
beyond measure. I trusted in others rather than relying on myself.
I am distressed if I have embarrassed my family and my friends and
my president.''
   Nofziger charged that prosecutor McKay ``set out to get me ...
because I would not knuckle under, because I would not cop a plea
and because I would not say I was remorseful, and I think he
succeeded.
   ``He makes mountains out of molehills. He has exaggerated, he
has misstated and I think he has lied. I don't think he is an
honorable man.''
   McKay made no statement during the 25-minute sentencing hearing.
But in a court filing last week he recommended imprisonment,
contending that Nofziger deliberately flouted the ethics law and
showed no remorse.
   ``There will be some bitterness, but we're very satisfied with
what Judge Flannery has done today,'' McKay said after the
sentencing.
   Nofziger was convicted Feb. 11 of three counts of illegally
lobbying then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese III and other
White House aides on behalf of the scandal-ridden Wedtech Corp., a
marine engineers union and the manufacturer of the Air Force A-10
antitank plane.
   The contacts were deemed illegal because they occurred within a
year of Nofziger's departure from the White House staff in early
1982.
   Flannery imposed the maximum fine, but the prison term was far
lighter than the maximum of two years on each conviction. He
sentenced Nofziger to terms of two to eight months for each of the
three counts but suspended all but 30 days of each, to be served
consecutively. He also ordered that Nofziger be placed on two years
probation.
   E. Lawrence Barcella, one of Nofziger's lawyers, disputed the
prosecution's contention that the former White House aide exploited
his government connections to enrich himself.
   McKay, in calling for the maximum sentence and fine, argued that
Nofziger unjustly enriched himself, quoting a pre-sentence report
as saying Nofziger is currently worth $2.8 million.
   Nofziger said the figure was inaccurate and told reporters his
net worth was ``none of your business.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is turning up the
heat against Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega by moving
to halt the flow of American dollars to the Central American
country.
   Citing ``the unusual and extraordinary threat'' of Noriega's
continued rule to the United States and the Panamanian people,
Reagan invoked the seldom-used International Emergency Economic
Powers Act.
   Invocation of the 1977 law puts teeth in the U.S. government
quest to freeze Panamanian assets and withhold tax payments by
American businesses and their subsidiaries operating there.
   ``These further steps reaffirm our commitment to democratic
government in Panama and our belief that Noriega would best serve
his country by complying with the instruction of President (Eric
Arturo) Delvalle to relinquish his post,'' the president said in a
letter to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Before Reagan's move, White House chief of staff Howard Baker
denied that economic sanctions applied earlier had proved
unsuccessful.
   ``After all, General Noriega is (a) much beleaguered, de facto
leader of the Panamanian government,'' he said. ``He is certainly
not in a comfortable position, nor are the people of Panama, which
is unfortunate.''
   Presidential aides tried to ``surgically design'' imposition of
the statute in a way to avoid causing long-term damage and the
collapse of the Panamanian economy, said a senior administration
official.
   ``It does have a major impact on trade by strangling the
financial situation there,'' said the official, speaking on grounds
of anonymity. ``Our purpose here is to impact on Noriega and not on
the Panamanian economy, and the strangulation of the financial
system seems to be the best way to do this.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that among the steps
the president ordered under provisions of the law are:
   _Blocking assets of the government of Panama in the United
States.
   _Prohibiting payments by all people and organizations in the
United States to the Noriega regime.
   _Prohibiting payments to the Noriega regime by all U.S. citizens
and organizations in Panama, including U.S. branches and
subsidiaries.
   It was the first time the law has been invoked since the
administration used it in the mid-1980s to squeeze Libyan strongman
Moammar Gadhafi. Then-President Carter invoked the act against Iran
in the late 1970s.
   Panamanian assets essentially have been frozen in U.S.
commercial banks since late March, when Delvalle obtained an
injunction from a federal court in Miami and the administration
followed up that by asking the Federal Reserve Board to freeze the
monies.
   The act that Reagan resorted to Friday merely broadens the
authority behind the freezing of these assets.
   ``I assume this ensures that the injunctions that were ordered
at that time remain in effect,'' the administration official said.
   Under the law that Reagan invoked in an executive order,
violators can be prosecuted. The criminal penalty is a 10-year
prison sentence and up to $50,000 in fines, and the civil penalty
is a $10,000 fine.
   The latest move stops short of an all-out trade embargo, and the
official said it would take another executive order to exercise
that option.
   Asked what national security emergency justified Reagan's
invoking the seldom-used law, the official said ``the presence of
General Noriega, who denies the legitimate authority of Panama.''
   ``The United States' interests are very heavily intertwined with
Panama's,'' he said. ``His presence increases the threat to the
canal, the people of Panama and our citizens there.''

<HEAD>Return Shows Tax Reform Worked To The Reagans' Advantage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has turned out a
winner in the tax-reform law he championed, making more money and
paying less tax last year than he did in 1986.
   The White House on Friday released copies of federal tax return
filed by Reagan and his wife, Nancy. It showed their tax liability
for 1987 was $86,638, or 25.1 percent of their $345,359 gross
income.
   In 1986, their tax bill had been $92,460 on a total income of
$336,640, or 27.5 percent.
   In other words, they made $8,719 more in 1987 than in 1986 but
paid $5,822 less in federal taxes.
   ``Basically, I would conclude that tax reform didn't have too
much of an impact'' on the Reagans, said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``It had some effect but not very much,'' Fitzwater added.
   He said he was not aware of any factors other than tax reform
that would have allowed Reagan to pay less tax on more income.
   The sweeping tax reform law, applied for the first time to 1987
returns, eliminated many deductions and lowered tax rates. For the
richest Americans, such as the Reagans, the maximum rate dropped to
38.5 percent last year, down from 50 percent in 1986.
   Reagan had waged an intensive campaign for tax reform, making
speech after speech around the country to prod Congress into
enacting the changes.
   The Reagans' returns provided a glimpse into their private life.
   For example, Mrs. Reagan sold three drawings by Japanese artist
Fojita that she inherited from her mother, the late Edith Luckett
Davis. They sold for $33,000, and were reported as a $31,350
capital gain after deduction of a sales charge.
   The Reagans reduced their reportable charitable contributions,
from $30,487 in 1986 to $25,407 in 1987. The tax return showed
$14,095 were given in cash contributions that were not identified.
Fitzwater said $214 of that amount were donated by Mrs. Reagan to
the Community Foundation of Greater Washington from residuals for
appearing on the television shows, ``Different Strokes'' and ``One
to Grow On.''
   Besides the unidentified cash contributions, Reagan also gave
$11,312 to his alma mater, Eureka College in Illinois. Of that
amount, $1,312 was a fee for appearing on the 25th anniversary of
Johnny Carson's ``Tonight'' show.
   Fitzwater said the contribution total did not include
non-deductible outlays Reagan had made for organ transplant cases
brought to his attention.
   Reagan is still drawing royalties from the autobiography he
wrote years ago, earning $281 last year on ``Where's the Rest of
Me.''
   The Reagans signed their tax returns last Wednesday, well ahead
of the April 15 filing deadline, while vacationing at their
mountaintop ranch. Their returns will be audited by the Internal
Revenue Service, as they are every year, Fitzwater said.
   Indeed, among the $77,792 in deductions claimed by the Reagans
are $32,200 in legal fees, including $7,600 for handling a tax
audit in 1986.
   The Reagans actually are owed a refund for last year since they
prepaid $97,392 in estimated tax payments and withholding. However,
they asked that the $10,754 they are owed be applied to their 1988
tax bill.
   In wages, the Reagans earned $201,526, most of it from his
$200,000 salary. Other major sources of income included $54,178 in
interest and $46,208 in capital gains.
   The blind trust Reagan established when he became president to
keep an arms length from his investments yielded $44,766 of the
interest income he reported. It also provided $319 in dividends.

   Back home after logging 16,000 miles in a
failed effort to get Arabs and Israelis to agree to negotiations,
Secretary of State George P. Shultz says he won't be deterred from
trying again.
   Their reluctance to sign on to a two-stage U.S. proposal for
negotiations, means one deadline has passed and another almost
certainly will go by the boards.
   The first was Shultz's call for a reply by mid-March. Israel and
Jordan, the two key parties, did not turn him down. But they also
did not agree to the talks.
   The second deadline was mid-April, the target date for an
international peace conference. That obviously will not happen,
Shultz said Friday at his last stop in Amman, Jordan.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir simply rejected a
conference in which he feared the Soviet Union might try to impose
terms on Israel.
   Jordan's King Hussein, on the other hand, refuses to sit down
and deal directly with Israel unless the United States, the Soviets
and the three other permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, China, Britain and France, play an active role.
   China, like the Soviets, has no formal relations with Israel and
invariably backs Arab positions.
   But despite the deadlines passing, Shultz is sticking to his
``time line'' for the negotiations. His plan calls for an
international conference, to please Hussein, but one without much
power, to satisfy Shamir.
   It would be followed in about two weeks by the opening of
negotiations to provide self-rule, but not statehood, to the 1.5
million Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Then, seven months later, full-scale negotiations would begin on
an overall settlement. To attend, Israel must agree to trade
territory for peace. Jordan, on the other hand, would not be
guaranteed Israel will relinquish all the territories captured in
the Six-Day war of 1967.
   Shultz told the Arabs a total withdrawal was just not ``in the
cards.''
   He also opposed creation of a Palestinian state and stood firm
against participation by the PLO in the talks.
   Shultz has all but acknowledged that even if he can get
negotiations going, he cannot expect an agreement in the little
more than nine months he has left as secretary of state.
   But he refuses to give up, despite the long odds against success.
   ``Who's afraid to struggle against odds?,'' he said Friday in
Amman. ``You have to be willing to do it. What am I saving myself
for anyway?
   ``I've got a few more months to go here and I want to try to
leave something constructive for the region and for my successors.
So I am going to put my back into it, why not?''
   Shultz has made three trips to the region in six months,
measuring the progress in inches.
   In 10 days, he is due to go to Moscow to plan the next
superpower summit meeting. He will have another session with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in mid-May, and then attend
the summit itself with President Reagan at the end of the month.
   The new nuclear weapons reduction treaty Reagan and General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev plan to sign is far from ready,
however.
   And there are lots of problems on Shultz's desk, including the
turmoil in Panama and completing an agreement with the Soviet Union
to withdraw the Red Army from Afghanistan.
   But he plans to go back to the Middle East.
   ``I will find the time,'' Shultz said.

<HEAD>Trump Gets Tax Break on Mar-A-Lago Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Friday that real
estate tycoon Donald Trump was entitled to an $86,000 tax break on
Mar-A-Lago after he challenged the county's assessment on the
118-room mansion.
   Circuit Judge Richard Burk ruled Friday that Trump was
responsible for taxes on the 17-acre estate's $7 million purchase
price, rather than an $11.5 million assessment made by the Palm
Beach County Property Appraiser's Office.
   Mar-a-Lago was built in 1926 by cereal heiress Marjorie
Merriweather Post. Trump's purchase in 1985 was the first time the
estate had been sold.
   Robb Maass, Trump's attorney, said Burk's decision was ``a very
proper way of looking at the market value.''
   Gaylord Wood, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who represented Palm
Beach County Property Appraiser Rebecca Walker, said the decision
would be appealed.
   ``Donald Trump has demonstrated once again that there is no one
better in this country at buying things for less than what they are
worth,'' Ms. Wood said.
   Trump challenged the assessment in a 1987 lawsuit after the
county said he owed $208,000 in taxes. Trump contended that the
bill should only be $122,000, including a 4 percent discount for
early payment.
   In a prepared statement, Trump said historic properties such as
Mar-a-Lago are often overassessed, so the ruling constituted a
victory for property owners who have preserved rather than razed
buildings.
   In his ruling, Burk wrote that Trump's $7 million purchase price
established Mar-a-Lago's market value because the estate has no
equal.
   ``Surely in this case, one sale does in fact make a market,''
Burk wrote.

   The Democratic candidate for a north
Louisiana congressional seat has returned to the campaign trail
after losing an eye in a car accident, and his Republican opponent
may be as happy as anyone to see him back.
   Foster Campbell, a state senator who suffered other severe
injuries in the accident, faces former congressional aide Jim
McCrery in the April 16 election to fill the seat left vacant when
Buddy Roemer became governor on March 14.
   The winner in the 4th District race will serve only the
remainder of the unexpired term in Congress and must run for
re-election in the fall when all Louisiana congressional seats are
on the ballot.
   Each candidate claims to be the ideological heir of Roemer, a
conservative Democrat who often sided with the Republican
president. They were locked in a close battle before Campbell's
March 13 accident en route to Baton Rouge.
   Campbell's car plunged into a 13-inch-deep hole where workers
had been replacing a section of concrete on Interstate 49. His
right eye was ruptured. His nose, left cheekbone and upper jaw were
broken.
   McCrery scaled back his campaign while Campbell was
recuperating, and Campbell's wife appeared in his place. She proved
to be a personable stand-in for her husband, and McCrery found it
difficult to campaign against her face-to-face.
   ``She doesn't address any issues,'' McCrery complained in an
interview. ``I'm the only one at risk in those situations.''
   Campbell resumed campaigning Thursday night at a fundraiser in
Shreveport. And he said the painful accident had helped his
campaign, citing polls indicating he held a slight advantage over
McCrery.
   ``I think a lot of people view me now as a person who won't
quit,'' he said. With Campbell back in the race, both candidates
resumed the tough campaign tactics they had used before the
accident.
   Campbell immediately accused his opponent of representing ``the
lobbyists and special interests.''
   ``I've been lobbying for good things, not voting for bad
things,'' said McCrery, the former regional manager for government
affairs with Georgia Pacific Corp.
   Then he called Campbell a crony of former Gov. Edwin Edwards,
the once-popular governor who lost a re-election bid to Roemer as
the state's economy declined and rumors of corruption circulated
about the state capital.
   Responded Campbell: ``I voted with Edwin Edwards when he was
right and when he was wrong I voted against him.''
   Campbell noted that McCrery only recently switched from the
Democratic party to the GOP and has never held elective office.
   ``I think Mr. McCrery is a strict opportunist,'' Campbell said.
``We'll see what the voters think about that.''

<HEAD>Increase In Atlantic Hurricanes Predicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in
the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas,
but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten
populated areas.
   William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado
State University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantic
hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above
average for the decade.
   The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the
last six hurricane seasons. Those years brought just two to five
hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.
   The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its most
active period usually begins Aug. 1.
   Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual
hurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his first
formal 1988 forecast in late May. He issued an early ``outlook''
Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference.
   ``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does
form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average
hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,''
Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
   But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the
equator and winds for ``El Nino'' periods, when eastern Pacific
waters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when
or where a hurricane might form.
   Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterly
winds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino'' period.
   Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually
occurred. His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and he
originally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure
to seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985. In 1984, when there
were five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.
   Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantic
hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said. He said the drought
has robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start their
escalation into hurricanes.
   That pattern eventually will change, he said, ``but it is
impossible to say when this shift will occur.''
   Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference
stressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the
lull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the
1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.

<HEAD>US Barley Harvest Could Decline This Year, Ag Department Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision last year by Saudi Arabia to reduce
import subsidies has made a big impact on world barley trade,
including U.S. shipments, says the Agriculture Department.
   Barley is not a huge crop nationally, but it is important to
many farmers and is an essential part of the U.S. food machine.
Last year, by comparison, barley output was 527 million bushels,
and corn 7.06 billion bushels.
   ``World barley trade grew explosively over the last two decades,
and has shown signs of leveling off only in the last year,'' says
Pete Riley of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Barley trade accelerated during the 1980s when world traffic in
other grains experienced severe contractions. Riley said the gains
were supported by increases in exportable barley supplies and by
export subsidies, notably by the European Economic Community, the
largest exporter.
   ``One of the key factors in demand has been the dramatic rise in
imports by Saudi Arabia, now the world's largest (barley) importer,
sparked by import subsidies,'' he said.
   Besides the EEC, the main barley exporters are Canada, the
United States and Australia. Others, which are comparatively small,
include Austria, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden. And Finland and
Sweden are expected to become net importers, Riley said.
   The most remarkable barley development has been the increase in
Saudi Arabia's imports from less than 100,000 metric tons in the
mid-1970s to 8.5 million tons in 1986-87. Import subsidies
equivalent to $81 per ton _ $1.76 per bushel _ were the key factor.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 45.9 bushels
of barley.
   Riley said the Saudi import subsidies ``sometimes exceeded the
price of the grain itself.''
   The reason for such large subsidies was Saudi Arabia's
commitment to improve consumer diets and to support a large number
of sheep imported live every year for Moslem pilgrims, he said. As
imports increased, so did Saudi reserve stockpiles of barley.
   But the import subsidies were reduced 67 percent last September,
and Saudi imports are expected to decline in 1987-88 to 5.5 million
tons. Even so, Saudi Arabia will still be the leading barley
importer, well above the next largest, the Soviet Union, which is
expected to import 3 million tons.
   ``In addition to budget considerations, one motivation for the
Saudi cut in subsidies was an attempt to increase domestic
production,'' Riley said in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine. ``Recent increases in the producer price have failed to
bring a big response, and 1987-88 output is forecast at less than
150,000 tons.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. barley production could decline this year from
the 1987 harvest of 527 million bushels, which was down from the
record of 610.5 million bushels in 1986. North Dakota is the
leading barley producer, with 139.2 million bushels last year.
   According to a recent USDA report, farmers may plant 10.3
million acres for harvest in 1988, down 7 percent from last year.
   Barley exports in the 1987-88 marketing year which runs through
May 31, are forecast at 115 million bushels, down from 137 million
last season. In 1985-86, U.S. barley exports were reported at 22
million bushels.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department reports.
   The sale, equal to about 18.4 million bushels, was handled by
the Peavey Co., 300,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 50,000; Artfer Inc.,
50,000; Garnac Grain Co. Inc., 50,000; and Louis Dreyfus Corp.,
50,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Friday the grain was sold under
terms of the long-term grain agreement between the United States
and the Soviet Union.
   Sims said the subsidies averaged $21.61 per ton, or about 59
cents per bushel of wheat.
   No selling prices were announced, but wheat has been averaging
about $2.72 per bushel recently, according to the USDA. That could
mean a farm value of about $50 million.
   The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on Moscow to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets
are required to seek U.S. approval. The Soviets were given approval
to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   So far, the Soviets have bought more than 8.5 million tons of
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year, as well as 4.1
million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of U.S. soybeans
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.
   Subsidies are provided under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. Private exporters are given surplus commodities
owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $20 to
more than $40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Sims said the Soviets have more than 510,000 tons remaining in
their current EEP authorization. An additional 1 million tons were
announced on April 4, plus some left over from earlier
authorizations.

   A judge refused Friday to place Mario
Cuomo's name on California's June 7 presidential primary ballot,
but Cuomo backers said they would appeal the ruling next week.
   The Draft Cuomo for President Committee filed suit Monday
against Secretary of State March Fong Eu after she ruled that the
New York governor had to be actively seeking the Democratic
nomination to qualify under California law for a place on the
ballot.
   Eu also rejected the estimated 17,000 signatures the committee
had submitted on Cuomo's behalf because they did not meet the
minimum of 500 signatures required from each of California's 45
congressional districts for a candidate to get on the presidential
ballot by petition.
   Paul DeMarco, attorney for the Cuomo committee, argued in
Superior Court Friday that Cuomo's active support of the effort was
not required under a portion of state law that directs Eu to place
on the ballot the names of persons ``generally advocated for the
nomination.''
   But Superior Court Judge Cecily Bond ruled that the section
applied only to people actively seeking the presidential nomination.
   She also rejected DeMarco's argument that the requirement of 500
signatures per congressional district was burdensome, noting that
statewide initiatives routinely qualify for the ballot by petitions
of up to 1 million signatures.
   Eu's attorney, Richard Nishite, said Saturday was the final day
to add or delete anything from the June 7 ballot.
   As certified by Eu, California's Democratic ballot includes the
names of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Sen. Albert Gore, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Lyndon LaRouche and Sen. Paul Simon. The names
of Vice President George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Robertson will
appear on the Republican ballot.

   Jimmy Swaggart and the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination walked away from each other after the
church said it was defrocking him for rejecting its punishment for
``moral failure.''
   Swaggart on Friday announced his resignation from the Assemblies
of God shortly after the church said it was ousting him for
refusing to undergo a year's suspension from the pulpit and at
least two years of rehabilitation.
   The punishment was ordered after Swaggart confessed publicly to
unspecified sins. Though never proven but also never disputed, it
was widely reported that Swaggart had committed lewd acts with a
New Orleans prostitute.
   A woman who said she was that prostitute said Swaggart paid her
$50 a visit to pose nude for him. Another defrocked Assemblies of
God minister, Rev. Marvin Gorman of suburban New Orleans,
reportedly hired men who photographed Swaggart with the woman
outside a motel.
   Swaggart, at a Friday news conference at which he refused to
answer questions, said his dismissal was inevitable but that
leaving the church was vital to save his Bible college and $140
million-a-year world ministry.
   ``Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to take
a position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve all
of the problems. But we feel we have no alternative or choice,''
Swaggart said.
   Asked if that meant Swaggart would form his own church, his
lawyer William Treeby replied: ``This ministry is an independent
church and always has been.''
   Shortly before Swaggart made his announcement, the Executive
Presbytery of the Assemblies of God, headquartered in Springfield,
Mo., said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to accept
the church's recommended punishment.
   The church's decision was announced in Springfield by the Rev.
G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent of the church, after he
and other members of the Executive Presbytery met by telephone
conference call.
   Earlier Friday, the church had received what Carlson described
as a ``gracious'' letter from Swaggart in which the evangelist
refused to accept the church's terms. Carlson declined to release
details of Swaggart's letter.
   The Rev. Everett Stenhouse, assistant superintendent of the
Assemblies, said Swaggart's chances of returning to the church are
slim. ``It would be a long trail back ... if at all,'' he said.
   Swaggart voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit Feb. 21, after
a tearful public confession of ``moral failure'' before his wife,
son and congregation gathered in his Family Worship Center.
   He later agreed to accept a punishment originally recommended by
Louisiana church officials _ a three-month suspension and two years
of counseling _ but the national church insisted on the more
stringent discipline.
   Swaggart said Friday he would stick to the punishment initially
decided by the Louisiana church officials. Under that punishment he
would not preach sermons until May 22, although he has been
``witnessing'' at church services.
   The scandal rocked Swaggart's Baton Rouge church, TV and school
complex. About 100 workers were fired, and Jimmy Swaggart Bible
College students and faculty are said to be clamoring to transfer
to other religious institutions.
   Swaggart's ministry brought in an estimated $142 million last
year, and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries. He
has been known for his harsh denunciations of the sins of others,
including two other prominent Assemblies ministers brought down by
scandal.
   PTL founder Jim Bakker lost his Assemblies credentials after a
sex-and-money scandal last year. Bakker did not opt for
rehabilitation.
   Swaggart also was said to have been instrumental in the downfall
of Gorman, who said the action Friday involving Swaggart ``further
proves the truth of the allegations I made'' in a $17 million
lawsuit he filed against Swaggart in March 1987. In it, Gorman
blamed Swaggart for destroying his ministry.

   John Zaccaro Jr. was a well-organized drug
dealer who was known as ``the Pharmacist,'' a prosecutor said in
the cocaine trial of the son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro.
   In opening arguments Friday, a defense lawyer for Zaccaro, now
24, conceded that his client had sold cocaine, but said he was
tricked into making the sale by an attractive female agent. The
trial was to continue today.
   Undercover agent Laura Manning, a state police officer,
testified that she went to Zaccaro's apartment during the
Middlebury College Winter Carnival, with instructions to buy a
quarter gram of cocaine.
   Manning testified that Zaccaro was not home when she first went
to his off-campus apartment on Feb. 20, 1986, but he answered the
door when she returned an hour later and said she was looking for
John.
   When asked what she said to Zaccaro, Manning responded, ``I
said, `A couple of people told me that you could sell me some
coke.'''
   ``And what did he say?'' asked Addison County State's Attorney
John Quinn.
   ``Sure,'' Manning quoted Zaccaro as responding. She added, ``He
pulled a tray from under the couch.''
   The tray, Manning said, contained about 15 packets of cocaine in
a plastic bag, with the packets marked by weight.
   Charles Tetzlaff, Zaccaro's lawyer, accused police of entrapment.
   ``The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a
regulated drug,'' Tetzlaff said. ``This is a case of improper and
overzealous police conduct.''
   Tetzlaff said ``an attractive female police officer'' who had
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped Zaccaro
into making the sale. He said it was Manning _ not Zaccaro _ who
brought up the subject of drugs and a purchase.
   Tetzlaff questioned Manning in detail about what she wore to
Zaccaro's apartment, and whether her jeans were tight and her
jacket open.
   Manning said she was told to dress like a college student. She
said she wore an open jean jacket, a yellow V-neck sweater and
jeans, which were not tight.
   Quinn, the prosecutor, conceded in his opening arguments that
Manning was inexperienced, but he asked jurors to remember the
Middlebury Police Department is a low-budget, small-town operation.
   It was difficult even for police to ``to scrap together $30' for
the drug purchase, he said.
   The prosecutor painted a picture of Zaccaro as a well-organized
drug dealer.
   ``When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the
good merchant that he is ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives
it to Manning, Quinn said.
   Police began investigating Zaccaro after receiving a note
containing Zaccaro's name, address, car registration and the words:
``The Pharmacist,'' Quinn said. Zaccaro earned the nickname on
campus because of his reputation as a drug dealer, authorities say.

<TEXT>
   The Arab hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet
began beating hostages Saturday after Cypriot authorities failed to
meet their deadline to refuel the airliner, the pilot told Larnaca
tower.
   Airport officials said the pilot radioed at 7:15 a.m. (12:15
a.m. EDT), one minute after the deadline, and said: ``The warning
has expired and they've started beating the passengers.''
   Asked if he could see the beatings, he replied ``affirmative''
and repeated the demand for fuel.
   The hijackers issued the ultimatum an hour earlier and said six
of the passengers held aboard the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 were
``sick'' and the refusal to refuel the jetliner ``is causing the
sickness,'' said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The jet landed in Cyprus Friday night after being turned away by
the Beirut and Damascus airports despite the frantic pilot's cries
he had a gun at his head.
   The five-day ordeal for the more than 50 people still aboard the
jet became more tense when the hooded hijackers issued their
ultimatum Saturday, saying also that they would blow up the plane
if security men tried to approach it.
   Earlier, when the plane was cleared to land, its captain told an
air traffic controller: ``I'll never forget this, thank you.''
   The blue-and-white jumbo jet touched down at 9:10 p.m. (2:10
p.m. EDT) after circling for 3{ hours over the Mediterranean
following a take-off from Mashhad in northeastern Iran.
   Before landing at Larnaca, one of the hijackers radioed the
Beirut control tower that panic had broken out aboard the aircraft
as it ran low on fuel, with many of the passengers becoming ill.
   A woman identified as Anware Khaled Al-Sabah, one of three
members of Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family on board, got on the
radio and told the Beirut control tower in a choking voice: ``I beg
you. Allow us to land. We have no fuel left.''
   It sternly refused, with the controller telling the desperate
pilot at one point: ``Do whatever you want. Crash on the tarmac or
in the sea ... We shall not let you land here.''
   After the jet touched down at Larnaca, a state of emergency was
declared at the airport.
   Foreign Minister George Iacovou went there to try to establish
contact with the hijackers, who are demanding the release of 17
terrorists jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies there in 1983. The demand echoed that of pro-Iranian
extremists holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   The captain, in a calm voice, called the Larnaca Airport's tower
and requested fuel, but did not say if the hijackers wanted to take
off again.
   The tower said that since it was a holiday in Cyprus, the
airport could only provide him with about 8,000 gallons, less than
a quarter of what a jumbo jet can hold.
   ``Please give us all you can,'' the pilot responded.
   A hijacker then told the tower that if the 17 prisoners in
Kuwait were not freed, ``the passengers and the plane are in
extreme danger.''
   He said his group's ``struggle is against imperialism and
Zionism and continuing until martyrdom or victory.''
   An official Kuwaiti delegation landed at Larnaca on Saturday
afternoon and met with Iacovou and Cyprus' interior minister,
Christodolos Veniamin, airport officials said.
   Cyprus initially closed airports in Larnaca and Paphos, on the
island's west coast, to the aircraft. But after Lebanon and Syria
also refused to allow the jet to touch down, the captain pleaded
for landing permission, saying he was out of fuel. ``This is a real
emergency,'' he kept repeating.
   The plane had 112 people on board when it was hijacked Tuesday
on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight nd diverted to Mashhad Airport. The
hijackers freed 57 people there on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Those released initially put the number of hijackers at five or
six, but diplomats who debriefed the freed passengers in Kuwait
said some mentioned as many as 10 hijackers.
   Iran originally refused to allow the plane to take off, blocking
runways at Mashhad, but the hijackers brought a man to the top of
the stairway and fired three warning shots, then tossed a grenade
out the door, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. It did not
say if it exploded.
   A passenger was forced into the cockpit and beaten, said the
news agency, monitored in Nicosia. The hijackers first threatened
to kill a passenger, then said they would blow the plane up if they
weren't allowed to take off.
   As the plane left Mashhad, the hijackers radioed a message to
the emir of Kuwait saying he must comply with their demands or they
will blow up the plane, IRNA said.
   Fire engines, buses and other vehicles were pulled onto to the
runways of Beirut airport, which is run by Syrian troops. The
Beirut control tower told the captain: ``If you try to land by
force, the plane will be fired on.''
   The captain said: ``A gun is pointed to my head. I request
landing permission to land to refuel.''
   ``We have been for 14 years under gunfire,'' an airport official
answered back, in a reference to Lebanon's civil war.
   Then, in Arabic, a hijacker said: ``I shall punish control tower
officials if they don't allow us to land. The passengers are all in
panic now and many of them are vomiting. Among the passengers is a
member of the Kuwaiti ruling family who has a heart condition.''
   Beirut airport sources said a control tower official in radioed
back saying: ``With all due respect to all families, permit me to
say that all the Lebanese suffer heart ailments (from the civil
war). Do not try to talk to me sentimentally.''

   An 11-year-old boy said he's learned
it pays to fight for what he believes in, after school officials
rescinded his suspension and allowed him to return to class without
cutting off his Mohawk haircut.
   Matt Youngs, who was suspended for refusing to cut a haircut
authorities deemed disruptive, will be allowed back in school
Monday, officials said Friday.
   Superintendent Alson Dougherty said a potential court battle
over Youngs' hair wasn't worth the trouble. The boy can wear his
hair as he pleases, the superintendent said.
   ``I want it back to normal,'' the boy said of his hectic week.
``I want to wear my hair the way it is and not be hassled.''
   Youngs was suspended for five days because school officials said
his haircut was an embarrassment to the school, Dougherty said.
Matt's hair was long in the back, shaved on the sides and given a
brush cut on top.
   ``Never has so little hair caused so much consternation among so
many folks,'' Dougherty said.
   The boy's parents, William and Clifta Youngs, said they didn't
necessarily like their son's haircut, but they liked even less the
school system telling Matt he had to change it.
   The Youngs said they were willing to go to court to defend
Matt's right to wear his hair the way he liked.
   ``It's grown all out of proportion to the reality of the
situation,'' Dougherty said after announcing that Matt would be
welcomed back at Sackets Harbor Central School.
   A court fight could drag on for years, building up enormous
lawyers' fees, he said, adding that he couldn't justify making
taxpayers foot the bill.
   ``He may be a graduate'' by the time a court fight is resolved,
Dougherty said.
   Matt and three of his friends first cut their hair in the Mohawk
fashion about three months ago. On March 16, Principal Robert
Wagoner Jr. wrote to the boys' parents, saying the boys would be
suspended if they did not change their hair. All but Matt's parents
complied.
   Since his suspension, Matt said he has received a couple of
dozen letters, mostly from people urging him not to give in. He
also received several calls from radio stations wanting to
interview him.
   ``It's hard waking up at 8 in the morning to talk to DJ's,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Prosecution Fights Defense Claims On Use Of Congressional
Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Independent Counsel in the Iran-Contra
criminal case is fighting claims that congressional testimony by
three of the defendants is being improperly used against them.
   A court filing made Friday by Lawrence E. Walsh's office denies
a defense charge prosecutors illegally relied on the congressional
testimony given by former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and arms dealer Albert Hakim.
   ``Defendants' involvement in the activities underlying the
indictment had been fully identified prior to any of their
immunized testimony,'' Walsh's office said in a brief filed by
Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge hired to handle the
congressional immunity issue.
   ``The government represents that the overwhelming majority of
its case-in-chief will consist of witnesses known to it and
documents obtained or requested by it before any of the defendants
gave immunized testimony,'' the prosecution brief said.
   Walsh's office opposed a defense motion to dismiss the 23-count
indictment on the grounds that prosecutors impermissibly based
their case on the three defendants' congressional testimony, which
was given under grants of limited immunity from prosecution.
   It also urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to deny the
defense request for a hearing on the congressional immunity issue.
   The defense claims that forcing Poindexter, North and Hakim to
stand trial on charges of conspiring to illegally divert proceeds
of the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels would violate
their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination because
they were compelled to testify before Congress.
   A fourth defendant, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord, testified at last year's congressional hearings without
such an immunity grant.
   Under the law, Walsh is prohibited from using the congressional
testimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against him.
He must also prove that he built his case independently of that
immunized testimony.
   But the prosecution brief argued that any statements North,
Poindexter or Hakim made voluntarily before Congress could be used
as evidence against them in the criminal proceeding.
   ``The immunity statute, like the Fifth Amendment, protects only
compelled disclosures,'' the prosecutor's brief said. ``In
contrast, the privilege does not protect voluntary answers or the
`spontaneous outpouring of testimony.'''
   Without identifying any voluntary statements, the prosecution
offered to forgo introducing such testimony as evidence if Gesell
denies the defense request for what Stern called a ``massive
multi-month'' hearing.
   ``The defendant's request for discovery is testimony to their
intent to use pre-trial proceedings to delay their trial by jury
and obtain unparalleled discovery in a criminal case,'' Stern said.
   Defense lawyers asked to question prosecutors and grand jurors
about whether they learned of the congressional testimony of North,
Poindexter and Hakim. They also want to examine documents to
determine if Walsh relied on the congressional testimony for leads.
   Stern said the prosecution should be allowed to submit for
Gesell's review ``sufficient evidence _ documents and witness
interviews all collected or requested before the immunized
testimony _ to demonstate that it is not unfair to place the
defendants on trial.''

<HEAD>Government to Publish Guidelines To Avoid Cheating In Employee
Drug Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is preparing to publish rules
to guard against employee cheating during random drug testing of
federal workers in sensitive assignments, according to a published
report.
   The guidelines, to appear Monday in the Federal Register, will
require that toilet water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of
samples and that temperature readings be taken from the samples to
detect substitution, The Washington Post said in today's editions.
   According to an agreement with Congress, the printing of the
guidelines must be followed with a certification by the Health and
Human Services Department that all federal agencies have a
drug-testing program that meets the regulations.
   Although all agencies have submitted plans outlining who will be
tested and for what drugs, the final certification date was
unclear. Agencies will be required to test for cocaine and
marijuana, but may test for PCP, opiates and amphetamines.
   Finally, the Office of Management and Budget must provide
Congress with an estimate of implementation costs before the
regulations become effective. The working estimate is thought to be
about $7 million, the paper said.
   The new guidelines draw heavily on the experience of the testing
which has been conducted in the military for the last seven years.
Currently, the Department of Transportation, which began a program
last year, is the only non-military agency testing employees in
sensitive jobs.
   The American Federation of Government Employees, which has filed
suit in federal district court in New Orleans against earlier
informal standards, contends the random drug testing violates
workers' constitutional rights.

   As the Cessna 210 rolled to a stop at Wiley
Post Airport, the reporters clustered around the pilot's door,
waiting for a word with the daring young aviator at the controls.
   The interviews would have to wait, however. ``I have to go to
the bathroom, first,'' said the 9-year-old pilot, Tony Aliengena.
   Tony, of Orange County, Calif., made his claim for the record
books April 2 when he landed in the Boston area after a
cross-country flight.
   He became the youngest pilot to fly across the continental
United States unaided, beating a 10-year-old's previous
achievement, according to the National Aeronautics Association.
   The youngster made a stop on his way home Friday in Oklahoma
City to refuel and stretch his legs a bit before heading to
Phoenix. ``It was pretty good, a good flight the whole way,'' Tony
said, his braces gleaming.
   Standing about 4-foot-8, Tony uses a car seat to reach the

his father. Tony is traveling with his flight instructor, a
newspaper reporter and an observer.
   ``He's experienced quite a bit in this week and a half,''
instructor Ed Ferrett said. ``I don't touch anything.''
   The one time he did put his hand on the controls, Ferrett said,
was during a storm near Chattanooga, Tenn., on their way east. ``We
went back and restarted the leg so we could say he flew the whole
way by himself,'' Ferrett said.
   Tony, a third-grader, got his start in aviation through his
father, who used to let the child sit in his lap during takeoffs.
Several months ago he heard about the 10-year-old who set the
record, and told his dad he'd like to try to beat it.
   ``The first time I asked him, he said no,'' Tony said. ``Then I
asked him about a month later and he said OK.''

<HEAD>One Millionth Car Rolls Off Assembly Line; Hondas Arrive in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first shipment of Honda cars made in
the United States rolled onto Japanese soil while the Ohio factory
that produced the exports turned out its one-millionth automobile.
   A shipload of 540 Accords made at Honda of America
Manufacturing's plant in this central Ohio city arrived in Tokyo on
Friday. The cars left Portland, Ore., bound for Japan last month.
   The voyage aboard the U.S.-flagged ship Green Bay was
interrupted when its ballast tank and fuel tank cracked during a
storm in the northern Pacific Ocean on the third day at sea. It
returned to Portland and left again on March 17.
   In Tokyo, Honda spokesman Bret Anderson said the company does
not build the American-made coupe.
   Production was halted for a few minutes shortly after 9 a.m.
Friday on Honda's No. 2 assembly line as a Civic four-door sedan
was driven off the assembly line at the plant which has been
building cars since November 1982.
   Al Kinzer, who became Honda of America's first employee when he
was hired as manager of administration in 1978, drove the car off
the assembly line.
   ``We owe our ability to produce 1 million cars in such a short
period of time to the teamwork and efforts of our (employees),''
said Kinzer, vice president and plant manager of Honda's engine
plant in Anna, Ohio. ``They have proven that Honda quality knows no
geographical boundaries.''

<TEXT>
   Florida officials have filed
misdemeanor charges against broadcasting executive Ted Turner, who
they say illegally brought two cougars and three black bears into
the state and released them.
   If convicted, Turner faces a maximum penalty of $500 and 60 days
in jail on each of the three counts of violating Florida wildlife
laws, a spokesman for the Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission said
Friday.
   One of the western cougars was killed March 9 after being struck
by a car near Capps, about 15 miles east of Tallahassee, said Henry
Cabbage, public information supervisor for the commission.
   An investigation led two game officers to Turner's Avalon
Plantation near Capps, the commission said. Turner staffers told
the officers that he had ordered the animals brought from his
plantation in South Carolina and released into the wild at Avalon,
Cabbage said.
   Assistant State Attorney Jim Hintz said he filed two counts of
importing non-native wild animals, one each for the bears and
cougars, and one count of possessing such animals. The charges were
filed March 30 in Monticello.
   A secretary at Turner Broadcasting System headquarters in
Atlanta said he was traveling and unavailable for comment Friday.
She said he received a notice in the mail Wednesday asking him to
come to Florida, but said it didn't state why.
   Hintz said Turner wouldn't be arrested, but would be served with
a summons asking him to appear or be represented by counsel at a
May 4 arraignment.
   Turner applied for a permit last year to move the bears from
South Carolina and release them on his Florida property, but it was
denied, Cabbage said. No permit had been sought for the cougars.
   Game officials will try to capture the other cougar, but the
bears will be allowed to roam free because it would be impossible
to distinguish Turner's bears from native black bears, Cabbage said.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Gore Sound Anti-Drug Theme; Jackson Courts Jewish Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential contenders Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr. both
are sounding anti-drug themes as they battle for Democratic support
in New York, while Jesse Jackson tries to make peace with the
state's Jewish voters.
   But while Jackson said Friday his campaign would ``continue to
heal relationships'' with the Jewish community, aides said he won't
have time to meet with Jewish leaders concerned that he is
anti-Israel.
   In the Republican race, meanwhile, Vice President George Bush
hit the campaign trail Friday for the first time since Bob Dole
quit the race and Pat Robertson switched his campaign into low gear.
   On a visit to Fort Worth, Texas, Bush said he was delighted with
the slim competition he faces for Republican delegates and
``wouldn't trade'' places with the three Democrats scrambling for
their party's nomination.
   Nevertheless, he said he wasn't banking on Democratic infighting
to pave his way to the Oval Office.
   ``I wish I thought the Democrats would have a unity problem but
I don't think they will,'' Bush said. ``I'm not counting on the
blood on the floor that exists at this moment to carry over and
cause the Democrats to hemorrhage to death.''
   Back in New York, Jackson campaign aide Gerald Austin said his
boss would not accept a request to meet with the Jewish Community
Relations Council because ``we've already answered all these
questions. I don't see why we have to go to a meeting to answer all
the questions again.''
   The questions revolve around Jackson's use of the phrase
``Hymietown'' during his 1984 campaign, his past association with
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has called Judaism a
``gutter religion,'' and his closeness to the Palestinian cause.
   Jackson himself had plenty of conciliatory words for Jewish
voters as he campaigned across New York and Long Island in advance
of the state's April 19 primary.
   Visiting the posh Sardi's restaurant in Manhattan, Jackson
recalled the days when ``it was commonplace to see signs that said
`blacks and Jews and dogs are not welcome.'''
   ``Our commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of
anti-Semitism, or sexism,'' he said. ``We've sent a message no one
can miss.''
   Dukakis and Gore, meanwhile, both had harsh words for the
effectiveness of the Reagan administration's anti-drug efforts, and
pledged to do better if elected.
   Speaking at a senior citizens center on Long Island, Dukakis
promised he'd ``wage a real war, not a phony war, on drugs.''
   ``In Latin America, the gravest threat to our security comes not
from the Sandinistas, but from drugs,'' the Massachusetts governor
said earlier in a speech at St. John's University.
   Gore was advancing a similar theme.
   ``The administration declared a war against drugs and drugs
won,'' the Tennessee senator told an audience on Long Island.
``They've got to say yes to funding for drug programs.''
   The 255 Democratic delegates at stake in New York's primary make
the state a crucial battleground for Dukakis, Jackson and Gore.
None thus far are close to the 2,082 delegates needed to gain the
Democratic nomination.
   Dukakis holds a slight lead, with 745.05 delegates, compared
with Jackson's 708.55, and Gore's 395.8. Illinois Sen. Paul Simon,
with 171.5 delegates, remains on the candidates' roster, but has
suspended all campaign activities.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose endorsement has been courted
unsuccessfully by the Democratic candidates, revealed he'd already
voted by absentee ballot for one of the contenders, but refused to
say which one.
   Cuomo said he was discussing making campaign appearances for all
three active Democratic candidates, as time permits.
   ``I'll go anywhere with them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Davis Sentence Should Serve as Warning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 8{-year prison term given a former alderman
convicted of extortion and racketeering, should warning others that
corruption by public officials will be punished severely, a federal
prosecutor says.
   ``Today was his turn to pay,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael
Shepard said after former alderman Wallace Davis, 36, was sentenced
Friday. ``It should serve as a lesson to people in his position.''
   A federal jury found Davis guilty Oct. 12 of racketeering,
extortion, attempted extortion and lying to an FBI agent during the
government's Operation Incubator probe of City Hall corruption.
   Shepard said Davis had amassed an ``amazing record of corruption
for someone just starting out in public office,'' extorting money
from small businesses in his impoverished ward and accepting bribes
from an FBI informant seeking lucrative city contracts.
   Shepard told U.S. District Judge Ann Williams on Friday that one
of Davis' schemes involved putting his niece on the city payroll
and then demanding that she kick back part of her salary.
   Davis, clenching and unclenching his hands behind his back,
stood silently before Ms. Williams.
   Defense attorney Paul Bradley said he would appeal Davis'
sentence.
   Davis' conviction came three months after he was acquitted of
charges that he had beaten and pistol-whipped a former secretary
over her cooperation with federal investigators in the Operation
Incubator probe.
   Davis narrowly lost a re-election bid in April 1987 in a
campaign he ran from his cell. He was indicted in December 1986 on
the federal corruption charges and in February on state charges in
the pistol-whipping case.
   Shepard and Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Pearl said Davis
accepted $5,000 from informant Michael Raymond, representing a New
York company trying to land a multimillion dollar city contract to
collect unpaid parking tickets.

<HEAD>Plastic Bottles To Carry Codes To Promote Recycling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The plastics industry is hoping to encourage
recycling of the bottles it makes by marking containers with code
numbers that designate the kind of plastic used.
   The Council on Plastics and Packaging in the Environment said
Friday that bottles soon will carry a single-digit number inside a
triangle to help guide recyclers.
   The council called a news conference to present its view that
trash disposal should make room for recycling, incineration,
landfilling and composting.
   The voluntary identification system devised by the Society of
the Plastics Industry calls for number codes on all plastic bottles
of 16 ounces or larger, and other containers of 8 ounces or more.
Almost all recycling markets are designed to handle one kind of
plastic at a time, though various efforts are under way to develop
techniques to separate mixed plastics.

<HEAD>Capitol ``Slammer'' Gets Official Who Had It Installed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The official who recommended the installation
of barricades to protect the Capitol from terrorists was himself
injured when his government car struck one of the so-called
``slammers.''
   Officer Dan Nichols of the Capitol police force said Capitol
architect George White, who is responsible for the Capitol's
buildings and grounds, was treated Friday by Capitol physicians,
along with a driver who also received minor injuries.
   Nichols said White's car struck the mechancial barrier at the
south entrance to the Capitol Plaza as the slammer was being
lowered to allow entry.
   ``Preliminarily, it looks like driver error,'' said Nichols,
adding that the investigation was continuing.
   White, a passenger in the back seat, disagreed with that
assessment. He said he thought the barrier had been lowered and
then rose unexpectedly, either because of a mechanical malfunction
or a barrier-keeper pushing the wrong button.

   A new law allows federal employees
to donate annual leave time to superiors who need prolonged, unpaid
absences from work for medical or family emergencies.
   There is a statutory ban on gifts from federal workers to their
superiors, which could have prevented some officials from
benefiting from leave-transfer programs. President Reagan on Friday
signed legislation to allow such transfers.
   It was also announced Friday that Reagan signed into law an
18-month extension of the deadline for filing civil actions
alleging age discrimination for certain claims filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
   The bill was passed in response to the failure of the EEOC to

<HEAD>3-Cent Stamp Sales Swamp Some Post Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service is working to refill
depleted inventories of 3-cent stamps at some post offices.
   The stamps are in high demand because they make up the
difference between the old rate of 22 cents for a first-class
letter and the new price of 25 cents.
   ``The stamps are out there, but some offices have a lot more
than others,'' spokeswoman Tanya Perkins said Friday.
   More than 1 billion 3-cent stamps were sent to local post
offices in preparation for the rate change last Sunday, Perkins
said. Another 600 million of the 3-cent stamps are in warehouses,
being used to replenish stocks where needed, she said.
   ``We had asked local offices to predict how many they would
need, and some had a lot more demand than expected. We've been
filling orders all week,'' Perkins said.

   The president declared a state of
emergency after students smashed store windows and overturned cars
in a second day of `anti-Yankee' riots. Early today, riot police
and tanks patrolled the streets.
   The government blamed the disturbances, in which thousands took
part, on leftist agitators and drug traffickers and vowed to ``take
all necessary actions to maintain order and tranquillity.''
   Authorities reported ``numerous'' arrests, but gave no figure.
   The emergency declared Friday by President Jose Azcona Hoyo
broadens police powers to make arrests and searches, bans public
demonstrations and restricts travel in the capital and San Pedro
Sula, 120 miles to the south.
   The government, the leading U.S. ally in Central America,
forcibly pooled Honduras' 140 radio stations into a national
network that broadcast appeals for people to remain calm.
Storeowners boarded their windows.
   Late Friday, authorities said police and soldiers had seized
Molotov cocktails in a raid on the National Teachers' School.
   The government press office said groups, some armed with
incendiary devices and others with automatic pistols, had been
arrested throughout the capital.
   During the night, four bombs exploded in separate parts of the
capital, but no injuries were reported, government-controlled radio
said.
   It said demonstrators torched six automobiles in San Pedro Sula
on Friday, but gave no further details on disturbances in that city.
   One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said ``numerous persons have been detained'' in both cities. He did
not elaborate.
   In a statement, the government claimed the protests had been
instigated by narcotics traffickers it did not name and ``a
dangerous infiltration of Marxist indoctrination, hate, terror and
destruction'' in Honduran schools.
   Friday's violence began when students filled the streets to
protest, as they had the previous day, the forced deportation of a
Honduran suspected of cocaine trafficking and involvement in the
slaying of a U.S. drug agent.
   About 100 Tegucigalpa schools and both universities in the
capital closed early on Friday, their students out on the streets.
   On Thursday night, about 2,000 university students set fire to
the U.S. Embassy annex and 25 cars owned by embassy personnel. Five
demonstrators were killed and 10 wounded.
   Police said about 20 private Honduran guards on duty at the
embassy compound had opened fire with sawed-off shotguns. Riot
police who dispersed the demonstrators not arrive until about two
hours later.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
expressed puzzlement Friday at the amount of time it took police to
arrive on the scene. She also said that neither the private
Honduran guards employed by the embassy nor U.S. Marine guards had
fired on the demonstrators.
   The students were protesting the arrest and delivery to the
United States this week of Juan Ramon Matta, who was wanted for
questioning in the 1985 killing in Mexico of a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency, Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   The alleged cocaine trafficker was seized at his luxury home.
   Protesters also expressed anger at President Reagan's dispatch
of 3,200 American troops to Honduras last month.
   On Tuesday, soldiers and police placed Matta onto a plane to the
Dominican Republic without a passport. Dominican officials put him
on a New York-bound flight and he was arrested en route by U.S.
marshals.
   Matta is being held at the maximum-security federal prison in
Marion, Ill.
   Honduran legislators called the incident a kidnapping and the
Foreign Ministry launched an investigation. Honduras has no
extradition treaty with the United States and the constitution
forbids the extradition of Hondurans.
   President Reagan dispatched the U.S. troops March 17 at Azcona's
request after a reported incursion into Honduras by Nicaraguan
troops pursuing Contra rebels, who have operated out of this
country.
   In Managua, the Sandinista government condemned Friday's
crackdown in Honduras as a violation of the Central American peace
plan signed by the region's five presidents on Aug. 7.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ President P.W. Botha decreed
broadened powers for his chief representative in this
Pretoria-ruled territory, insisting the rights of whites and other
minorities must be protected.
   The official, Administrator-General Louis Pienaar, will be
empowered to take action against ``subversive'' media, arrange for
regional or racially based elections and refer certain major court
rulings to South Africa's appellate court.
   Cabinet ministers complained that the new powers, announced by
Botha Friday during a visit to Windhoek, amounted to greater South
African intervention in the affairs of this territory alsk known as
Namibia.
   Botha, after a three-hour meeting with the territory's
multi-racial Cabinet, also indicated he might accept proposals to
eliminate most racially segregated political structures.
   Finance Minister Dirk Mudge, a white moderate, said he hoped
Pienaar would consult with the Cabinet rather than acting
singlehandedly to perpetuate a whites-only political structure.
   Also Friday, Archbishop Desmond Tutu flew with other Anglican
bishops to the territory's northern region of Ovambo.
   Tutu, an outspoken critic of Botha and South Africa's system of
apartheid, spoke to 1,500 exuberent worshippers at a war-damaged
mission center near the Angolan border.
   In Windhoek, more than 100 supporters of the South-West African
People's Organization staged an anti-Botha demonstration outside a
downtown hotel, holding up placards with slogans such as ``Stop
Sucking Our Blood'' and ``Take Your Puppet Government to Pretoria.''
   SWAPO, which has been waging a guerrilla war against South
African rule for 22 years, claims overwhelming support in Ovambo,
home of 55 percent of Namibia's people.
   Niko Bessinger, an official of SWAPO's legal political wing,
said Botha was manipulating the territorial Cabinet as part of a
``divide and rule'' strategy aimed at avoiding one-man, one-vote
national elections.
   Pienaar said it was virtually certain the interim government
Botha installed in 1985 would be allowed to repeal a controversial
1980 proclamation that establishes 11 ethnically based second-tier
governments in Namibia.
   Blacks, who make up 88 percent of Namibia's 1.3 million people,
complain the system provides disproportionate benefits for the
white and mixed-race communities, each of which makes up 6 percent
of the population.
   Pienaar said the 1980 proclamation would be repealed only when
provisions were adopted to ensure that the cultural and linguistic
rights of minorities were protected.
   The interim government favors total repeal of apartheid-style
laws, but a white and mixed-race party supports retention of
racially segregated structures.
   Botha reiterated that South Africa will not agree to the U.N.
call for Namibian independence until all Cuban troops withdraw from
neighboring, Marxist-ruled Angola.
   Namibia is the main staging point for South African troops who
are fighting in Angola in support of rebels.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

   A 20-year-old, developmentally
disabled man has been reunited with his parents, six days after he
disappeared following a weeklong party that inflicted $10,000
damage on his family's home, police said.
   Michael McConaghey ``is safe and sound. And his parents are very
happy,'' Deputy Police Chief Richard Hammer said Friday, announcing
the felony theft arrest of a 17-year-old girl accused of
instigating the blowout.
   McConaghey, who apparently fled out of fear for his parents'
anger, was detained at an Indiana truckstop Friday while trying to
hitch a ride to Nashville, Tenn., police said. His parents picked
him up hours later.
   Hammer said Lisa Wood, 17, of Wheaton apparently organized the
party that ran from March 29 until Sunday, while vacationing
parents Corinne and Wallace McConaghey had left the house in
Michael's care.
   Apparently, police said, Miss Wood contacted McConaghey after
hearing him on a Chicago radio station, saying he was lonely and
giving his telephone number on the air.
   Hammer said Miss Woods gave Michael beer during the week and
that the alcohol, mixed with medication he takes, made him pass
out. While Michael slept, Hammer said, Miss Woods entertained as
many as 100 people.
   When police arrived at the house Easter Sunday, Michael appeared
disoriented and told them he had fallen asleep. Michael then walked
off, and his parents had been looking for him ever since.
   Miss Wood was arrested on felony theft charges, accused of
stealing the McConagheys' car, which was found in a forest preserve
Monday, a day after neighbors called police to the family home and
questioned Michael.
   About $15,000 in property was stolen from the house in addition
to the damages, police said.
   Hammer said investigators are continuing to locate other people
who were at the party. So far, six teen-agers, including Miss
Woods, have been arrested and have posted bond.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators suspended talks on setting
up Contra rebel cease-fire zones, with the Sandinistas calling the
rebels intransigent for demanding they be allowed to receive
military supplies inside the zones.
   Military leaders of the two sides met six times in the southern
border town of Sapoa to negotiate precise locations, sizes, and
rules governing conduct inside the zones.
   A preliminary peace agreement signed March 23 by Sandinista and
Contra leaders calls for the U.S.-supported rebel fighters to
gather inside the zones by April 15.
   But the Contra military delegation abruptly abandoned Friday's
meeting and immediately left in vehicles for the Costa Rican border
without comment.
   Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, head of the Sandinista delegation,
termed Friday's talks ``very serious'' and said rebel negotiators
had been intransigent in demanding they be allowed to maintain
military supplies inside their zones.
   The Sapoa peace accord permits humanitarian assistance to the
rebels, to be administered by a neutral international organization.
   Cuadra said the technical talks would be resumed alongside
high-level negotiations between the Sandinistas and the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the Contra umbrella group, next Friday in Managua.
   They will try to negotiate a permanent end to the war, which has
killed more than 40,000. A 60-day cease-fire went into effect April
1.
   Cuadra said the rebel technical delegation ``didn't have
sufficient authority'' to respond to a 25-point government proposal
outlining Contra activity inside the zones. The proposal addressed
food assistance to the rebels and verification procedures.
   Cuadra said the government proposal was based on the Sapoa
accords and the Central American peace plan signed by the region's
five presidents Aug. 7.
   The Contra team had proposed its own 34-point plan on Thursday.
   Among other conditions, it demanded the rebels be allowed to
receive military assistance, recover military supplies and maintain
a munitions stock, and have access to air delivery of necessary
supplies.
   Cuadra dismissed the rebel proposal as seeking ``to violate the
sovereign rights of the Nicaraguan republic.''
   On Thursday, the two sides had agreed on defining the location
of seven Contra zones.
   Cuadra said he hoped negotiators could resolve outstanding
differences at the April 15 meeting.
   President Daniel Ortega was quoted in newspapers Friday as
saying the Contras signed the preliminary accord because they had
been defeated militarily after nearly seven years of war and
``never held an inch of territory.''
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada said the president explained
that the Contras would move into the zones, lay down their weapons
and return to civilian life.
   But the Contras say they will never put down their weapons until
Nicaragua is ``on an irreversible road to democracy.''
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, on Friday, a Sandinista official,
Commandant Victor Tirado, told a news conference that the
Sandinista government is dissatisfied with the way the truce is
taking shape.
   ``We cannot be satisfied with developments the past few days,''
he said. ``The Contras took part in setting the dates for the
cease-fire, and then they start breaking the accord themselves.''

   John Demjanjuk, a retired auto worker awaiting
a verdict in Israel on charges that he committed war crimes as a
Nazi death camp guard during World War II, has filed a lawsuit to
regain his U.S. citizenship.
   Demjanjuk, who lost his citizenship in 1981, alleges in the suit
filed Friday in U.S. District Court that the Justice Department's
Office of Special Investigations withheld evidence that would have
helped prove his innocence.
   A federal judge ruled that Demjanjuk lied to conceal from U.S.
authorities his alleged past as the brutal guard Ivan the Terrible
at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   Demjanjuk, 68, was extradited in 1986 to Israel. He had lived in
the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills.
   ``We've acquired documents through unknown sources that really
lay out, plain and clear, what OSI's intentions were from the
beginning _ that they did not believe Mr. Demjanjuk was in fact
Ivan the Terrible and they went ahead and prosecuted him and
suppressed the evidence that would help him prove his case,'' said
Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law.
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Demjanjuk has
been unsuccessful in a number of appeals in the case ``and we will
respond in court to the present suit.''
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk says he's a victim of mistaken
identity and was never at the Treblinka camp. Demjanjuk has
admitted lying on his immigration papers, but says he did so
because he feared execution if he returned to the Soviet Union
after the war.
   Demjanjuk says he served in the Soviet Army, was captured by the
Germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner-of-war camps until 1943.
He claims he was not at Treblinka, as alleged, in 1942 and 1943.
   The Israeli judges are expected to render a verdict April 18.
   The case to recover his citizenship is based on material
obtained through the Freedom Of Information Act and Justice
Department documents sent anonymously to the family.
   According to Demjanjuk's suit, government investigators
interviewed 71 people but only disclosed the existence of 31
interviews to defense attorneys and released only 11 statements.
   The suit also alleges that the government failed to reveal that
most of the people interviewed failed to identify Demjanjuk or
their identification was flawed.

<HEAD>U.S. Congressmen Take up Vietnamese Offer to Search for MIAs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Vietnam-US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Americans, including two U.S.
congressmen, accepted an offer today to join Vietnam's foreign
minister on a helicopter search for Americans possibly still alive
in the nation, one of the group said.
   Bill Hendon, a former U.S. congressman from North Carolina, said
he and three others already had applied for visas to Vietnam at
Hanoi's office at the United Nations in New York.
   ``We accept without reservation Foreign Minister (Nguyen Co)
Thach's invitation for on-site inspection of Vietnamese prisons we
say hold U.S. prisoners of war,'' Hendon quoted a telegram the
group sent today to the country's U.N. office.
   There was no immediate comment from Vietnamese officials.
   Thach told visiting U.S. Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., in Hanoi
earlier this week that if any congressmen presented evidence of
American POWs in Vietnam he would personally accompany them by
helicopter to investigate.
   If POWs were found, Vietnam would cover expenses of the
investigation while the Americans would pay if none were found,
Thach reportedly told Pressler.
   The Vietnamese official apparently did not spell out what
evidence congressmen had to present before an investigation trip
was launched.
   Thach had made the offer previously but nobody had taken him up
on it. He and other Vietnamese officials often react angrily to
American charges that Hanoi still holds POWs from the Vietnam War,
which ended in 1975 when communist North Vietnam defeated
U.S.-supported South Vietnam.
   In a telephone interview from Washington, Hendon said his group
was certain there were Americans still in captivity and that they
would guide Thach to prisons where they are being held.
   Hendon gave no other details about the locations of the prisons
or the numbers allegedly being held.
   Hendon said others in the group were Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn.,
Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H., and Eugene McDaniel, a retired U.S. Navy
pilot and a POW in Vietnam for six years.
   McDaniel and Hendon are members of the American Defense
Institute, a conservative study group which focuses on the issue of
Amerian MIAs and POWs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   Last September, Hendon led a group of Americans to Thailand's
Mekong River boundary with Laos where they floated plastic bags
containing offers of a $2.4 million reward for the rescue of U.S.
POWs in Indochina.
   The reward money had been pledged in part by 21 U.S. congressmen.

   Subaru of America has announced it is recalling
some of its 1988 four-wheel drive Justy models sold before April 1,
1988, to correct a wiring problem that could cause an electrical
short-circuit or engine fire.
   About 300 to 600 of the vehicles equipped with an accessory air
conditioner will be modified to correct an alternator wire chafing
problem, the Cherry Hill, N.J.-based company said in a written
statement Friday.
   No accidents or injuries associated with the problem have been
reported.
   The alternator wire could chafe against the solenoid hose stay
bracket, possibly causing an electrical short or fire in the engine
compartment, the American-operated import automobile company said.
   Owners of the affected vehicles are asked to take them the
nearest Subaru dealer, the company said.

<HEAD>Many Fear Girl's Death May Signal Start Of Bloodier Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ELON MOREH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli girl's death in
a clash with Arabs was a watershed in four months of violence,
radicalizing Jewish settlers. Many fear it presages a more savage
conflict in the occupied lands.
   The killing of Tirza Porat on Wednesday shocked the nation, but
the general feeling had been that it was only a matter of time
before a Jew living in these disputed hills would die because of
the Arab rebellion.
   Ironically, Israeli media reported Friday that it was likely the
girl was slain by a bullet fired from the rifle of a Jewish settler
guarding her, and not by a rock flung by an Arab as the army
previously reported.
   The reports said the guard may have inadvertantly fired on Tirza.
   Still, many settlers blamed their government _ accusing it of
creating an atmosphere of leniency toward Arabs that made the
confrontation possible.
   One of the sorest points to the 850,000 Arabs in the West Bank,
which they call ``occupied Palestine,'' is the presence of 65,000
Jewish settlers in the land Israel calls by the biblical names
Judea and Samaria.
   The Israelis have ruled the West Bank and Gaza Strip since
capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``Israel is a castrated giant, afraid to deport Arabs, afraid to
really punish rioters,'' said Eliakim Haetzni, a lawyer and leader
in the Kiryat Arba settlement.
   ``We've reached the point where the last Arab urchin in the last
alley in the last refugee camp is no longer afraid of our
government or our army, so of course they attack Jewish children,''
he told The Associated Press.
   Benny Katzover, head of the settlement council, said: ``If our
leaders don't take steps to stop the Arabs now, they will not be
able to stop Jews from taking things in their own hands.''
   Palestinians fear that. ``Now settlers will retaliate against
Palestinians everywhere,'' said Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American who
advocates non-violent resistance.
   ``Soon the army will have to make a decision about who is
running the show. If it is the settlers, that means there will be
more killings on both sides.''
   Jewish settlers enraged by Tirza's death raided Arab villages
under cover of night, beating Palestinians and smashing windows of
Arab-owned homes and cars near the settlements of Kiryat Arba and
Elon Moreh, where the girl lived.
   Tirza, 15, and other teen-agers from Elon Moreh were on a
Passover holiday hike, accompanied by two adult guards. They
encountered stone-throwing Palestinians and were led to Beita,
where the fatal clash occurred.
   Two Arabs also were killed and 141 have died since violence
began in the occupied territories Dec. 8, according to U.N.
figures. One Israeli soldier was stabbed to death but Tirza is the
first Israeli citizen killed.
   Settlers carried guns at her funeral on a West Bank hillside at
midday Thursday. Some shouted ``Revenge! Revenge!'' despite
admonitions from a rabbi, who said over a loudspeaker that such
disruptions were out of place.
   The death of the teen-ager appalled Israelis. Many demanded that
the Arabs of Beita be punished, but others said the were dragging
the country deeper into its war with the Palestinians.
   ``This will mean the start of a cycle of bloodshed that will be
difficult to end,'' the left-wing daily Hadashot declared.
   ``If you cannot enforce a stronger policy, Mr. prime minister,
our next meeting will again be in a cemetery,'' Hanan Porat, a
settler leader who is not related to Tirza, told Yitzhak Shamir at
the girl's funeral.
   Some Israelis asked why Jewish children were hiking in the West
Bank hills at a time of such trouble.
   One hiker, her head bandaged, explained from her hospital bed:
``We have to show them that we are the owners of the country.''
   Her party made one mistake, she said: ``It wasn't good that we
had only two guns.'' She spoke on television and was not identified
by name.
   Requests for gun permits have increased by 50 percent since
December, mostly from Israelis in the occupied territories and
Jerusalem, the daily Al Hamishmar reported.
   According to Moshe Weiss of the Interior Ministry, about 200,000
Israelis own private weapons. Both parents and the older children
in many West Bank homes are getting permits.

   Madeline, the vagabond dog, is home in New
York after eight months on the road.
   The 6-year-old black Labrador retriever disappeared eight months
ago from its home with Peggy and Edward Clark in Lowman, N.Y. She
flew home Friday courtesy of the folks in Monmouth.
   ``I'm just so thankful she's coming home,'' Mrs. Clark said. ``I
hope she recognizes us.''
   The dog's 2,000-mile odyssey started with a truck driver from
Ohio who picked Madeline up on a highway in upstate New York last
August.
   After several months in Ohio, he dropped the dog off with his
friends, Jackie and Bill Barton, in Monmouth, a city of 10,700 in
western Illinois.
   Maria Lawson of the Monmouth Chamber of Commerce said the dog
was thin and ill when it arrived from Ohio and some of the Barton
neighbors suggested Madeline be put to sleep.
   ``The Bartons really saved Madeline's life,'' Ms. Lawson said.
   Instead of killing Madeline, the Bartons nursed the canine back
to health and made her part of the family. Then they noticed a
telephone number etched into the dog's dirty red collar. They
dialed the number, and Peggy Clark answered.
   ``I was amazed,'' Mrs. Clark said. ``I'm delighted and very
grateful to the people in Monmouth for taking care of her and
getting her on the way.''
   The Chamber of Commerce handled flight arrangments and paid for
Madeline's $300 ticket.
   Madeline will find things have changed since she left. She may
find her doghouse crowded because the Clarks have a new black
Labrador.

   The girl was stillborn late Wednesday night or early Thursday at

   Nurses followed hospital procedure of wrapping the body in

   Jesse Jackson won't be taking time
from his busy campaign schedule to meet Jewish leaders because he
has already explained his controversial statements on Jews and
Israel, his campaign manager says.
   ``He has answered the same questions over and over again,'' said
Gerald Austin, explaining Friday why the campaign had decided not
to meet with the Jewish Community Relations Council, an umbrella
group of Jewish organizations.
   Austin spoke to reporters outside a Long Island fund-raiser at
the Wading River home of Marty Bergman, a CBS television producer.
   Austin said he had counted 48 communities in and around New York
City that are bigger than Des Moines, Iowa, where the presidential
candidates spent weeks campaigning. ``You need to spend time in
these places,'' he said.
   That kind of campaigning doesn't leave time for what Austin
considers the unproductive meeting to again answer qustions about
Jackson's use of the offensive term ``Hymietown'' to describe New
York in his 1984 campaign, and his past association with Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   The incidents left many Jewish voters with the feeling that
Jackson might be anti-Semitic, and they also do not like his views
on the issue of a Palestinian homeland.
   Austin made the comments even as Jackson appeared to be subtly
reaching out to the large numbers of Jewish voters as he campaigned
vigorously across New York and Long Island seeking votes for the
state's April 19 primary.
   On different occasions he mentioned anti-Semitism along with
racism as reprehensible attitudes.
   At the landmark Sardi's restaurant in Manhattan's theater
district, Jackson told a labor leaders' breakfast that in the
pre-civil rights South, ``It was commonplace to see signs that said
`blacks and Jews and dogs are not welcome.'''
   He mentioned three white civil rights workers who were shot in
the early 1960s in Mississippi, and noted two of them were Jewish.
   Asked by reporters about Jewish resistance to him, Jackson said:
``We continue to build relationships. We continue to heal
relationships. Ours is an inclusive outreach campaign.''
   Additionally, he said Jews are among many minority and ethnic
groups he has involved in his campaign and added: ``Our commitment
is to end any vestiges of racism, of anti-Semitism, or sexism. ...
We've sent a message no one can miss.''
   At a senior citizens forum at Adelphi University in Garden City,
an audience member asked him to comment on U.S. apathy in early
World War II while Hitler was beginning his Jewish extermination
campaign.
   ``We did abandon many Jewish people to Hitler's hell. It was a
tragic mistake,'' Jackson said.
   ``We should forever accept a shared responsibility. We must
assure it will never be allowed to happen again.''
   Jackson then said the United States must fight for the right of
Soviet Jews to emigrate, and for the right of Israel to exist as a
secure state.
   At the Wading River fund-raiser, Jackson spoke in opposition to
the nearby Shoreham nuclear plant, which is awaiting a full-power
operating license. He said nuclear power is too expensive and
unsafe, and he endorsed alternative forms of energy.

   A tribal militiaman gunned down a
70-year-old Roman Catholic priest from Chicago in the southern
Philippines after accusing the clergyman of harboring criminals,
the military reported today.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos today ordered an investigation in
the killing of the Rev. Carl Schmitz, including the possibility
that religious differences may have played a role. He did not
elaborate.
   In Chicago, a church official said he was told the priest was
slain because he had refused to employ the killer's wife.
   A military report said the Schmitz died Thursday from multiple
gunshot wounds from a .30-caliber Garand rifle during the attack
inside his convent in Koronadal, a provincial capital 620 miles
south of Manila.
   It said Schmitz was slain by Saguin Munday, 29, a teacher and
head of the local government militia, after a heated argument over
the priest's willingness to give sanctuary to wanted tribal
criminals.
   Munday, a B'laan tribesman, surrendered to police authorities
after the slaying.
   Schmitz did missonary work in Japan before being assigned to the
Philippines in 1974. He was the head of the Notre Dame of Marbel
Colleges, a missionary school for the minority B'laan tribe.
   Manila newspapers gave differing accounts on Schmitz's killing.
   The Philippine Inquirer said Schmitz had punched Munday during
the confrontation, prompting the militiaman to shoot the priest.
The Manila Bulletin, quoting a military report, said the priest
allegedly turned down the wife of Munday who was applying for a
teaching job in the school.
   In another account, the Daily Globe said Munday barged into the
Convent of the Passion and without saying a word gunned down the
priest.
   Today's edition of the Chicago Tribune quoted Rev. Sebastian
MacDonald, provincial superior of the Passionist Community, as
saying priests in Manila told him Schmitz was killed by the husband
of a woman who had been refused a teaching job at the missionary
school.
   ``We are going to petition the Filipino government to set up an
investigative committee to explore the facts and clear his name of
any smear,'' MacDonald was quoted as saying.
   Schmitz also served a missionary in China in the late 1940s but
was expelled during the communist takeover.

   Separatist Tamil rebels stopped 14
Sinhalese villagers on a road in northern Sri Lanka and massacred
them, military officials said today.
   Also, a senior police official said detectives had arrested a
Sinhalese man believed responsible for an attempt to assassinate
President Junius R. Jayewardene in Parliament last August.
   The rebel slayings took place Friday evening, when villagers on
bicycles and in a truck were stopped near the town of Anuradhapura,
about 100 miles northeast of Colombo, said the officials, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   They did not elaborate on the slayings.
   The latest killings raised to at least 147 the number of
villagers slain in northern Sri Lanka since March 2. Most of the
victims have been members of the island's majority Sinhalese
community.
   But at least 22 members of the minority Tamil community were
killed in a revenge attack blamed on Sinhalese March 11, and 17
Moslems died in a raid blamed on Tamil separatists March 31.
   Frank Silva, director of the national Criminal Investigation
Department, said the ``the main suspect in the Parliament grenade
attack'' was arrested Friday at the village of Naula, 68 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   He was identified as Ajith Kumara, 28.
   One lawmaker and a clerk were killed and several people were
injured Aug. 18, when two hand grenades were thrown into a
conference room where Jayewardene was presiding over a meeting of
Cabinet ministers and Parliament members.
   The attack occurred shortly after India and Sri Lanka signed a
peace accord July 29 aimed at ending the Tamil minority's
4-year-old guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the north
and east of the island.
   The accord was opposed by many in the majority Sinhalese
community, who felt it made too many concessions to the Tamils. The
largest of the Tamil rebel groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, also has rejected the pact.
   India now has more than 50,000 troops on the island to try to
contain the Tigers' rebellion.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population. They claim they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and military.
   India has become involved because it has an estimated 60 million
ethnic Tamils in its southern states who are sympathetic to the Sri
Lankan Tamils.

   A 17-year-old accused of shooting her
parents in bed as part of a plot with her younger brother has been
arrested in Indiana, authorities said.
   Tammy Norris of St. Louis was stopped Friday evening about 40
miles southeast of Indianapolis, police said. She was held on
$100,000 bond in the Decatur County Jail.
   Her parents were not seriously wounded in the shooting early
Friday. Her father, Charles Norris, was shot once with a
.22-caliber rifle as he lay in bed. The bullet went through his
shoulder, then grazed the ear and cheek of Ellen Norris, police
said.
   The teen-ager apparently was angry with her parents because they
had disciplined her brother for failing to clean up the basement,
said Sgt. Ted Zinselmeier of St. Louis County's crimes against
persons unit.
   Miss Norris was charged Friday with two counts of first-degree
assault, two counts of armed criminal action and one count of
automobile theft in warrants issued by the St. Louis County Circuit
Court. Her 16-year-old brother was taken into custody by juvenile
authorities.

   A panhandler who used a dying 3-year-old girl
and her brother to win sympathy has been charged in her beating
death, and police appealed for further help from the passerby who
tried to save her life.
   Benito Sanches, 36, a ``crack'' cocaine addict who came to
America in the 1980 Cuban boat lift, was charged Friday with
second-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend's daughter,
Maya Figueroa, police said.
   She was the second toddler in two weeks to die a violent death
at the city's biggest welfare hotel, The Prince George Hotel.
   Welfare workers had investigated the family for complaints of
abuse and neglect, but caseworkers had found no evidence of child
abuse, said Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for the city Human
Resources Administration.
   Detectives were investigating whether the girl's mother, Elise
Vasquez, 32, was involved in the alleged abuse, police Capt.
Michael Gardner said.
   On Thursday, the night Maya died, Ms. Vasquez was in Bellevue
Hospital, where she had given birth to her fifth child, a boy, the
day before.
   In an interview with the Daily News on Friday before signing
herself out of the hospital, Ms. Vasquez was quoted as saying she
did not believe Sanches had hurt Maya and said that ``he loved the
child like it was his own. ...
   ``She would call him `Dada.' She wanted to be with him and to
play with him. He would take her panhandling because she liked to
be with him,'' Ms. Vasquez said. ``She has been going out with him
for two years and he never laid a hand on her or any of the other
kids.''
   At the time of the battered girl's death Thursday, Maya and her
18-month-old brother were being used by Sanches as panhandling
props, police said. They said he had used them before to solicit
money.
   ``He hoped to get sympathy and compassion that way,'' said Aaron
H. Rosenthal, assistant chief of Manhattan detectives.
   Maya was in her stroller when a concerned passerby noticed her
as Sanches begged for coins at 28th Street and Second Avenue at
9:30 p.m. Thursday. The man flagged down a taxi, gave the driver
$5, hustled the three into the cab and ordered the driver to take
them to a hospital, police said.
   Maya was declared dead on arrival at the emergency room at New
York University Medical Center. Her brother, whose name was
withheld, was admitted to the hospital for observation although he
showed no signs of abuse.
   Authorities questioned the cab driver; they hoped to locate the
good Samaritan and find out what he saw that night.
   ``We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to
him about what was going on,'' Gardner said.
   An autopsy Friday indicated the toddler died of blunt force
injuries to her head and abdomen with internal injuries and
bleeding, said Ellen Borakove of the city medical examiner's
office. The case was ruled child abuse and a homicide.
   Maya had ``bruises and contusions on her face, back and neck.
Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' Gardner told a news
conference.
   The two children, their mother and Sanches lived at the Prince
George on Manhattan's East Side, which has 2,600 residents, mainly
homeless families. Ms. Vasquez's two other children, ages 12 and
14, live with relatives in Brooklyn, police said.
   Two weeks ago, 3-year-old Quintin McKenzie was scalded to death
in a bathtub at the Prince George. His mother, Merian McKenzie, was
charged with second-degree murder, and her husband, Calvin C.
McKenzie, was charged with assault for allegedly beating the
toddler.
   At the Prince George on Friday, a steady stream of people flowed
in and out of the two steel doors guarding the threadbare lobby.
Many of them pushed strollers or had young children by the hand.
   ``I have to say it: it's drugs,'' said a 21-year-old woman with
a stroller, who identified herself only as Maria. ``If they don't
get money for the drugs, they take it out on the kids.''
   ``It's drugs,'' said Dr. Maria New, who chairs the Pediatrics
Department at New York-Cornell Medical Center. ``McKenzie was
drugs, and now this one, all drugs.''

   Police this morning arrested 91
protesters staging a sit-in at a Penn State building, ending a
15-hour impasse over a canceled meeting with university officials
on minority issues.
   ``I think it's a terrible message to send to the students, when
the president of this university would rather send state troopers
to meet with them than come himself,'' said Seth Williams, who is
president of the student government.
   Williams, one of more than 150 students who occupied the
university's Telecommunications Building overnight, said he was
cited for defiant trespass.
   David Stormer, director of university safety, said most students
were charged with summary trespass, while some faced disorderly
conduct charges.
   ``It was a very peaceful demonstration,'' he said.
   More than 75 police officers from university, State College and
state police took part in the arrests.
   The university had obtained an injunction Friday in Centre
County Court, ordering the students to leave the building.
   Students were arrested individually, issued yellow citation
slips and released, receiving cheers and hugs from their friends
outside a police cordon around the building.
   Stormer said about 130 people were in the building just before
the arrests, but many left rather than face criminal charges.
   The students, most of them black, began the protest Friday after
a meeting between student leaders and school administrators failed
to agree on ground rules for another session to discuss minority
issues.
   The university canceled a similar meeting Friday after officials
said they couldn't reach student leaders who had demanded the
meeting to end an earlier sit-in outside the office of Penn State
President Bryce Jordan.
   ``We're going to do it, folks. Ain't no stopping us now,'' said
Darryl King, a senior from Philadelphia and past president of the
Black Caucus, a student organization.
   Robert Blair, a spokesman for the Black Caucus, said minority
students should have a voice in programs at the university that
affect them and criticized Penn State for failing to meet a
court-mandated goal for black enrollment.
   This fall, Penn State failed to reach a 5 percent black
enrollment, which the university agreed to under court order. Penn
State has a 3.6 percent black enrollment, which equals 2,424 black
students.
   Late Friday night, Craig Millar, assistant vice president for
student services, told the protesters that they would be violating
Penn State's code of conduct if they remained and could be subject
to dismissal from the university.
   He also said they could face criminal charges of disorderly
conduct, harassment and trespassing. ``Your point has been made and
we are please asking you to leave,'' Millar said.
   Outside the building half a dozen students slept in sleeping
bags, while others huddled under blankets in the 37-degree chill.
   King said they would occupy the building until they're arrested
or their demand is met for a meeting with Jordan and other
university officials. ``Right now we will be in this place until
whatever happens,'' he said.
   Jordan had agreed Tuesday to convene the canceled meeting to end
an earlier sit-in outside his office by nine black students and a
local pastor.
   Carol A. Cartwright, chairman of the Equal Opportunity Planning
Committee, said the university had offered to set up a meeting
Friday night outside the building to plan a forum next week on
minority issues. The offer was rejected.
   ``We need to make it clear we have made very serious offers,''
Cartwright said. ``We are willing to have a dialogue, but we're not
willing to let students occupy buildings and get this accomplished
this way.''
   Student leaders said they didn't trust the university to keep
its word once they left the building.

<HEAD>Impact Of New U.S. Economic Sanctions Studied</HEAD>
<HEAD>With US-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American businessman described new
U.S. sanctions against Panama as futile and said they gave Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega the opportunity to shut down American firms
there.
   ``The U.S. has very little to say in this situation as far as
preventing U.S. companies from deciding whether or not to pay taxes
in Panama. If you don't pay, your right to operate here can be
taken away,'' said the manager of a U.S. franchise in Panama,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   President Reagan ordered the new sanctions, which prohibit all
payments by American citizens and organizations in the United
States and Panama to the Noriega government. The ban specifically
includes branches and subsidiaries of American companies.
   The sanctions come after Texaco, Eastern Airlines and other U.S.
firms paid more than $5 million in taxes and fees to the Noriega
government for doing business in Panama.
   The United States previously had stopped paying monthly toll
fees to the Panama Canal Commission and had frozen government
deposits in American banks.
   Noriega, head of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and the
power behind the civilian government, is under indictment in the
United States on drug trafficking charges. The United States has
called upon the general to step down.
   Don Halman, manager of the General Mills operation in Panama,
said he believed the sanctions would not apply to his company.
   While the local General Mills operation is partly
American-owned, he said, ``It is a Panamanian corporation with
Panamanian shareholders. I would not think that it could apply to
us.''
   The U.S. Embassy said tax payments by U.S. firms should be
directed to an escrow account set up by the Federal Reserve Bank in
New York for deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Noriega forced
Delvalle from office after Delvalle tried to fire the general on
Feb. 25.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle as Panama's legitimate
president.
   There are 190 members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Panama,
but many are franchises of American firms and operate as Panamanian
corporations.
   All businesses in Panama, including U.S. firms, must pay social
security taxes, workers' compensation, value-added and other taxes,
according to a U.S. businessman who has been in the country more
than 15 years.
   ``If you do business in a country you have to obey the laws of
that country,'' said the businessman, who added that the sanctions
gave Noriega an excuse to seize U.S. businesses.
   The shortage of dollars, Panama's official currency, has kept
banks closed since March 3 and prevented the government from paying
130,000 public employees and 15,000 troops for more than a month.

   China's legislature today approved Li Peng as
premier and endorsed a reorganization plan that intends to make the
government a leaner, more efficient instrument for promoting
economic development.
   Li, a Moscow-educated technocrat, has been acting premier for
five months.
   One National People's Congress delegate voted against the
reorganization of state ministries and top-level commissions, which
was approved by a show of hands of the 2,877 delegates attending in
the Great Hall of the People. One delegate abstained.
   A key component of the reorganization, the merger of China's
railway and communications ministries and national airline, was
abruptly dropped. Officials said only that delegates had objected
to it.
   The delegates then voted by ballot for premier, vice chairmen of
the state Central Military Commission and top judicial posts.
   In announcing the results, the state-run Xinhua News Agency did
not say if any delegates voted against Li.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is a delegate, did not attend
and there was no official explanation for his absence. Deng, 84,
had appeared in good health at Friday's congress session.
   Ninety-two ordinary delegates said to have other business were
also absent.
   Foreign reporters were allowed to watch from a balcony, as they
were for the first time Friday when the congress elected Gen. Yang
Shangkun president and former Vice Premier Wan Li to head the
congress Standing Committee.
   Li, 59, was appointed acting premier by the previous congress'
Standing Committee in November, when Zhao Ziyang gave up the post
to become Communist Party chief.
   Since then, the former vice premier and minister of education
and power industry has felt his way slowly in his new job. Although
he supports China's program of modernization, Li's public
statements indicate he favors moving cautiously in introducing
market-style economic reforms, in contrast to Zhao's emphasis on
the need for speedy action.
   In his speech to the congress when its session opened March 25,
Li strongly endorsed the reform goals of Deng and Zhao, but warned
against rushing ``headlong into mass action'' or being ``too
impatient for quick results.''
   In other voting, Zhao was elected vice chairman of the state
Central Military Commission under Deng as chairman. Yang Shangkun
stayed on as permanent vice chairman.
   Zhao has no military experience, and the post is seen as an
opportunity for him to gain the connections and support in the
military he will need if he is to succeed Deng as China's top
leader.
   Six members of the military commission also were elected,
including Qin Jiwei, head of the Beijing Military Command who is
expected to be named defense minister.
   Ren Jianxin, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, was
promoted to president, replacing Zheng Tianxiang.
   Liu Fuzhi, 71, a former minister of justice and minister of
public security, was elected the nation's top prosecutor.
   The government reorganization approved Saturday calls for
splitting several existing ministries and combining others,
reducing the total number from 45 to 41. Among the major changes,
the current planning and economic commissions will be merged into a
powerful body directing China's economic and social development
strategies.
   The ministries of coal, petroleum and nuclear industry will be
merged into a single Energy Ministry, while the Ministry of Labor
and Personnel will be split in half.
   The cancellation of plans to merge the railways and Civil
Aviation Administration of China, the national flag carrier, came
as a suprise not only because of its abruptness but because the
Railways Ministry was regarded as a prime target of reform.
   The train system, China's main means of long-distance travel,
has failed to expand as quickly as demand, and has been criticized
for chronic mismanagement and sloppy operating procedures. Four
fatal train accidents this year, claiming a total of 168 lives,
created a clamor for improved safety measures.
   The congress is expected next week to approve ministerial
appointments and vote on several key laws, including one that would
guarantee business people more freedom from government interference.
   It also is expected to approve a constitutional amendment
legitimizing China's small but growing private sector.

<TEXT>
   Police have found further traces of two missing
Wheaton College newlyweds but still are unable to determine if
their week-long absence has been the result of foul play.
   Scott Swanson, 23, and Carolyn MacLean, 22, have not been seen
since the couple left the Flint, Mich., home of Ms. MacLean's
grandmother April 2 on their way to the Swanson family home in the
west Chicago suburb of Elgin.
   Sgt. Raymond Caplis of the Chicago Police Youth Headquarters
confirmed late Friday that identification belonging to one of the
missing students had been found in a downtown alley, near the spot
where Ms. MacLean's car was found.
   ``The cards were found in the alley behind Orchestra Hall _
apparently beneath a Dumpster,'' Caplis said.
   Caplis declined to describe the identification, but WBBM-TV
reported that it included several credit cards and a student
identification card.
   Another youth headquarters officer, Detective Paul Stubblefield,
said earlier Friday that neither of the two missing students had
withdrawn any money from their bank accounts since leaving Flint.
   There was speculation initially that the couple, who married
secretly March 26, might have taken off on a delayed honeymoon. But
that speculation was tempered by fear because Ms. MacLean's red BMW
was found last Saturday with its engine running, and police said
there was evidence its glove compartment had been tampered with.
   A pack of cigarettes and a lighter found in the car indicated
the car may have been stolen because friends said neither Swanson
nor Ms. MacLean smoked.
   While police in Illinois, Michigan and Indiana searched for
possible clues, friends, family members and fellow students spread
fliers with the missing couple's pictures to restaurants and gas
stations along Interstate 94 between Flint and Chicago.
   Police have been investigating a report that the two were seen
at a Stevensville, Mich., restaurant off Interstate 94 last
Saturday shortly after leaving Flint.
   John Bradburn of Elgin, a friend of the Swanson family who
helped coordinate the volunteer effort, described the couple as
``good students and good Christians.''
   ``It's been real hard for everyone, especially the families,''
Bradburn said. ``You're up, you're down, you get encouraged with
one report, and then that doesn't work out.''
   Bradburn said Swanson was a senior majoring in psychology.
   School officials said Swanson was active as an ROTC cadet, and
Ms. MacLean, a New Jersey native, worked part time as a model.
   Fellow students at Wheaton College, a religious school west of
Chicago, held round-the-clock prayer services for their missing
schoolmates.

<HEAD>Chemicals Spill After Freight Train Derails Along Columbia River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASCO, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-three cars of a 135-car freight train
derailed along the Columbia River, and two of the cars leaked
hazardous chemicals, authorities said.
   No one was hurt in Friday's derailment, but the single-track
line was blocked and was not expected to be reopened until Sunday.
   The Burlington Northern train was carrying primarily lumber and
other forest products, along with some chemicals, ore, pumice,
aluminum bars and other industrial goods.
   One tank car landed on its side on the river bank and leaked
sodium borohydride, a chemical used in bleaching wood pulp and
manufacturing plastic foam. The other leaking car tumbled partly
into the river, spilling sodium borohydroxide, a closely related
chemical used in chemical manufacturing, petroleum products and
papermaking, said Howard Kallio, a spokesman for Burlington
Northern.
   Both chemicals produce heat as they dissolve in water but are
not explosive, Kallio said. They can be harmful if people breathe
the vapor or dust or come in contact with the substances, he added.
   Dave Hare, chief of the Benton County hazardous materials team,
said more than half the sodium borohydroxide in the partially
submerged tanker spilled into the river before the leak was stopped.
   McNary Dam, about 23 miles downstream, was closed for nearly 2{
hours to increase the dilution of the chemical before it passed
farther west, eliminating any possibility of danger from the spill,
he said.
   The leaking car on the riverbank also contained sodium chloride,
Hare said. Hazardous materials team members tightened bolts on the
dome of that car to stop the leak.
   Cleanup of the derailed cars will take three or four days,
Kallio said.
   The cause of the accident, which took place about eight miles
east of Plymouth, was undetermined. The allowable track speed was
60 mph, but Kallio said he did not know the actual speed of the
train.
   Amtrak passenger trains were being rerouted to Union Pacific
tracks on the Oregon side of the river, he said.

   A small bomb exploded beneath a stairway at
the capital's main motor vehicles office today, injuring two people
and shattering windows, police said.
   A police spokesman, Col. Ibrahim Harb, said a package containing
about two pounds of dynamite exploded under a stairway near the
building entrance at 11:30 a.m. (4:30 a.m. EDT).
   The blast injured a policeman and a civilian, although ``not
badly,'' he said. The explosion shattered windows, cracked walls
and damaged a door, he said.
   ``We know it was meant to harm people because it exploded ...
when public use of this entrance is usually the heaviest,'' Harb
said.
   ``Fortunately there weren't many people today because people can
get their licenses now from police stations,'' he said, referring
to a recent change of policy.
   He said police were still trying to determine who planted the
bomb, but the official Jordan News Agency hinted at a political
motive.
   ``It comes at a time when his majesty, King Hussein, is
discussing the national Arab stand for defending the nation and
Palestine and Arab lands,'' said an unidentified official quoted by
the agency.
   He was referring to discussions on starting Middle East peace
talks. U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz traveled to Jordan
this week to meet with Hussein about the talks.

<HEAD>British Airways Criticizes Boeing On Quality Control Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways has criticized Boeing Co. for
faulty workmanship and poor quality control in the construction of
commercial aircraft _ the second complaint revealed this week by an
international Boeing customer.
   The Seattle Times today reported that British Airways, in a
letter written in February, complained in particular about Boeing's
plant in Everett, 30 miles north of Seattle, where the company
makes 747 jumbo jets and twin-engine 767 widebodies.
   The newspaper quoted the letter as saying at least one mistake
compromised the integrity of a 747 and that Boeing workers ``seem
oblivious that they are building aircraft where any mistake not
properly corrected or hidden represents a direct compromise with
safety.''
   The Times obtained a copy of the letter Friday. It was written
by D.K. Craig, British Airways' chief engineer for technical and
quality services, to Phil Condit, executive vice president of
Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
   Boeing officials Friday said they were aware of the situation.
However, company spokesman David Jimenez said they declined to
discuss it ``until later.''
   Japan Air Lines complained to Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz in a
letter leaked Tuesday to the Japanese press. JAL's complaints
ranged from incorrect assembly of fire-extinguisher piping in 767s
to engine-temperature sensors being installed in reverse order in a
747. The letter demanded that Boeing make greater efforts to
achieve better quality control.
   A Japan Air Lines spokesman was quoted in a Wall Street Journal
story this week as saying the defects were not ``critical problems
for safety.''
   Craig's letter cites problems spotted by airline inspectors at
the Boeing plant ranging from missing fasteners to wrong or missing
parts, the newspaper reported.
   One missing part caused the floor of a jet to bow so much that a
main deck cargo power drive unit wouldn't work, the newspaper said.
   ``My quality inspectors can only properly inspect a very small
proportion of each aircraft,'' Craig wrote. ``They should never
ever come across ... missing fasteners, missing parts, cracks .. .
fasteners fitted the wrong way round. Yet we find instances of some
of these on every aircraft.''
   British Airways placed Boeing's largest-ever order potentially
worth $4.1 billion in August 1986 when it ordered 16 747-400s and
placed options for 12 more. It also has 11 767s on order and flies
Boeing 737s and 757s.
   Like other customers, British Airways maintains a staff of
inspectors at Boeing factories.
   Craig Martin, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman, said after
the JAL letter was made public that an investigation was under way
to determine how the mistakes occurred and said he believed they
were ``one-time occurrences.''
   But the British Airways official wrote the situation
``underscores our fears that the underlying reason for the Boeing
Co.'s poor quality record is that the production work force are in
general, inadequately trained, possess a low level of basic working
skills, and of paramount concern, seem oblivious that they are
building aircraft where any mistake not properly corrected or
hidden represents a direct compromise with safety.''
   Boeing, the world's biggest maker of commercial aircraft and one
of the United States' biggest exporters, is in the third year of a
major effort to improve products, increase productivity and cut
costs.

   A 10-year-old boy drove out an intruder
by pounding him with a board after the man broke into the boy's
house and grabbed his little sister around the neck.
   Burglary officer H.R. Barnett said that in nearly 17 years as a
police officer he had ``never seen such a degree of bravery in a
little boy'' as that of Michael King.
   ``He chased off a 36-year-old man by hitting him about the head
and back with a stick,'' Barnett said.
   Keith Strode was arrested soon after the incident and was held
in the Jefferson County Jail on a charge of violating his parole,
police said.
   Michael's mother, Wanda King, said her husband was at work when
a man crashed through her bedroom window shortly after midnight
Wednesday morning and seized her 7-year-old daughter, Latasha, a
police report said.
   Mrs. King and Michael fled the house but once outside, Mrs. King
saw the intruder had her daughter around the neck, the report said.
Michael rushed back into the house and drove off the man with a bed
rail slat, it said.
   Shortly after, police said they found Strode a few blocks away
and took him to the King home, where Michael said, ``That's him.
That's the man who was in the house.''
   Strode was taken to Cooper Green Hospital for treatment of cuts,
police said.
   Mrs. King said the children still are frightened about sleeping
at night.
   ``I don't know what made (Michael) do it. It must have been the
Lord guiding him,'' she said.

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Punjab police said today they fear that
Sikh extremists have acquired one or two U.S.-made Stinger missiles
and have hidden them inside the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest
shrine.
   Police halted trucks carrying rice, milk and other basic
supplies to the temple to search for the missiles.
   The missiles would represent a major upgrading in the arsenal of
Sikh extremists, who have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982
for an independent homeland in Punjab state. In the past, the Sikhs
have largely relied on knives, swords, pistols and automatic rifles.
   A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said today that ``initial intelligence reports suggest the
militants inside the temple may have Stinger missiles with them.''
   Authorities were unsure where the weapons would have come from,
but one police official said they were ``obviously from Pakistan.''
   The United States has supplied the shoulder-launched Stinger
missiles via Pakistan to Afghan guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed Afghanistan government.
   India has accused neighboring Pakistan of allowing Sikh
militants to train and arm on its territory.
   The militants are also believed to use the temple for military
purposes. Police say about 400 people are in the temple complex,
some pilgrims and some militants.
   A June 1984 government raid to drive radicals from the shrine
left more than 1,200 people dead, mostly Sikhs. Soon afterward,
Sikh bodyguards killed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Militants are
believed to have rearmed the temple since then.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they suffer discrimination
from India's majority Hindus.
   They are the religious minority in India but form the majority
in Punjab.

<TEXT>
   A judge has granted a defense lawyer's
motion to delay the criminal trial of ex-Gov. Evan Mecham and his
brother, Willard, for a month.
   Maricopa County Superior Judge Michael Ryan announced his
decision Friday after Michael Scott, a lawyer for Evan Mecham, said
he had a scheduling conflict with an unrelated child-abuse case set
for trial April 19.
   Ryan agreed to postpone the Mechams' trial to May 19 from April
21 despite the objections of assistant attorneys general Barnett
Lotstein and Michael Cudahy.
   The new trial date is two days after a recall gubernatorial
election scheduled for May 17.
   The Arizona Supreme Court is expected to decide next week
whether the election will proceed despite Mecham's ouster from
office after his conviction Monday by the Arizona Senate on two
impeachment charges.
   The governorship is held by Rose Mofford, formerly Secretary of
State, who assumed the job after Mecham was impeached Feb. 5.
   Evan Mecham, 63, and Willard Mecham, 67, were indicted by a
state grand jury Jan. 8 on charges of violating state laws by
concealing a $350,000 loan to Evan Mecham's 1986 gubernatorial
campaign.

<HEAD>Cartel Leaders Meet To Discuss Oil Price Drop</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers opened talks here
today on possible ways to reverse a worldwide slump in oil prices.
Sources said a consensus was emerging that the cartel should not
respond by cutting production.
   Although the price depression is costing OPEC at least $35
million a day, most of the ministers feel that further cuts in OPEC
production will not help, said cartel sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said the ministers instead would likely renew a call for
production restraint by independent oil producing nations such
Mexico and China.
   The ministers were not empowered to make OPEC policy decisions,
but they hoped to recommend to their cartel partners on what, if
any, action should be taken at the next full OPEC conference, set
for June.
   Those attending the closed-door meeting represented Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia and Algeria and reflected a
cross-section of views within the organization.
   Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the oil minister of Venezuela, told
reporters no decisions had been made.
   Some analysts believe that if OPEC decides not to reduce its
production further, oil prices will fall in coming weeks because of
a global glut.
   Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, an oil trade
publication, said today in Vienna that he thought OPEC inaction
would drive the price down by as much as $1.50 a barrel, to about
$14 a barrel for top-grade crudes.
   On Friday, world oil markets were calm. The price of Brent crude
from the North Sea traded in London for May delivery at $15.60 a
barrel, down 10 cents from Thursday.
   ``There's a high degree of skepticism (among traders) regarding
the outcome of this meeting,'' said Peter Gignoux, an analyst in
London for the investment firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
   The talks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
opened amid renewed signs that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most
influential member, was growing impatient with the failure of some
members to strictly abide by the cartel's rules.
   King Fahd was quoted Friday by the official Saudi press agency
as saying he regretted that some OPEC members, whom he did not
identify, were unsettling the oil market by offering price
discounts in violation of OPEC statutes.
   Fahd was said to have denied recent reports that his kingdom was
offering price discounts to some customers.
   The Venezuelan oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, said it
should be viewed as a routine session of the cartel's
price-monitoring committee, which is authorized to meet whenever
oil prices fall substantially below OPEC's target of $18.
   It was the first meeting of the committee since last December's
full OPEC conference in which the cartel decided to maintain _ at
least through June _ its existing oil production quotas for all
members except Iraq.
   The Iraqis have refused to cooperate in limiting output.
   Analysts say OPEC has been producing near its 12-nation
production ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day. Prices
nonetheless have dropped to between $15 and $16 a barrel.
   With OPEC's production, including that of Iraq, apparently
running at between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels daily, the
price decline is costing OPEC as a group at least $35 million a day.

   An American senator returning from
Vietnam predicted today that the United States and Vietnam would
establish special offices in each other's capitals as early as this
year.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., a Vietnam War veteran, said such
special interest sections would help expedite the accounting for
Americans missing in action during the war, the plight of
Amerasians and other problems between the former enemies.
   Pressler told a news conference that despite opposition to such
sections from the U.S. State Department, there would be
``overwhelming support'' in the U.S. Congress and implementation
within the next two years.
   Last month, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former prisoner of war
in Vietnam, introduced legislation to set up the special interest
sections, which are usually housed in a third country's consular
offices.
   Pressler said he would seek an amendment to include a U.S.
``special technical office'' in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Ho Chi Minh City, formerly called Saigon, is the major exit
point for thousands of Vietnamese departing for the United States
and other countries under the U.N.-sponsored Orderly Departure
Program.
   These include the children of Vietnamese and American couples,
or Amerasians, during the war.
   Pressler also predicted full diplomatic relations would be
established within five to 10 years.
   ``I think we are on the verge of some substantial changes in our
relations with Vietnam. Our policy on Vietnam will change,'' he
said. ``We have so many common bonds.''
   Pressler, who served as an Army second lieutenant in Vietnam 21
years ago, met with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and other
Vietnamese officials this week. On Wednesday, he took part in a
ceremony at Hanoi in which the remains of 27 people believed to be
missing Americans were repatriated.
   It was the largest such transfer of remains since the last
American forces withdrew from South Vietnam on March 29, 1973.
   
   Pressler said that given severe food shortages in Vietnam, he
explored the idea of sending some food aid to that country by
private American organizations. But he said such aid should not be
tied to the accounting for 1,767 Americans MIAs in Vietnam.
   Pressler said he agreed with the State Department's policy on
tying the U.S. trade embargo with Vietnam's accounting for the MIAs
and the withdrwal of its troops from Cambodia, which Hanoi invaded
in late 1978.
   But he said he could not understand the Department's opposition
to the interest section offices.
   ``Whether we like it or not, our country is going to have a
great interest in Vietnam,'' Pressler said, citing the large
numbers of U.S. war veterans, Vietnamese who have settled in the
United States and other factors that bind the two countries.
   U.S. troops supported South Vietnam, which was defeated by
communist North Vietnam in 1975.

   A severe earthquake struck the Bismarck Sea off
the north coast of New Guinea on Saturday morning, the Royal
Observatory in Hong Kong reported.
   The 7:21 a.m. quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale and was
centered about 420 miles north of Port Moresby, the observatory
reported.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale can cause
severe damage in populated areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is
considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage
in populated areas.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz may go to
Geneva on Thursday to attend the signing of accords calling for the
withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan after an occupation of
more than eight years, an administration official said today.
   But the signing expected Thursday depends on a formal response
by Moscow to a U.S. proposal for a symetrical continuation of U.S.
and Soviet aid to warring factions. The offical, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the Soviets have not yet affirmed the
compromise and a decision on Shultz attending the signing depended
on that affirmation.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would sign the accords for
the Soviet Union, which would withdraw its troops by the end of the
year. The United States has provided shoulder-fired Stinger
missiles and other arms to guerrillas at war with the Marxist
government in Kabul, which is backed by the Soviet army.
   Shultz proposed ending all U.S. and Soviet aid to the two sides,
but was turned down by the Soviets and offered the compromise,
calling for symetrical levels of aid, in its place.

<HEAD>Many State Tax Changes Unfair To People With Lower Incomes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half the states with income taxes have made
them less fair for many low- and middle-income residents since the
federal tax to which they are geared was thoroughly revised in
1986, a union-financed study reported Saturday.
   In 20 states and the District of Columbia, taxes were raised
more in percentage terms for some low- and middle-income taxpayers;
cut more for the wealthy, or increased outright on the poor and
middle class and reduced for the rich, according to the study by
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   The union said the study provides the first solid evidence of
how state tax burdens have been shifted in the wake of federal tax
overhaul.
   ``While many states made great strides in improving the fairness
of their income taxes last year, too many continued to buy into the
old, failed ... program of cutting taxes for the wealthy,'' said
Gerald McEntee, union president. ``Making a working couple with two
kids and an income of $24,000 pay more taxes, while giving a tax
cut to the town banker who makes five times as much makes no
sense.''
   The 1.1-million-member union is a consisent backer of liberal
tax, spending and social policies. It favors ``progressive'' taxes
_ those in which ability to pay is a major factor.
   The study considered effects of the tax changes on four types of
households _ a one-earner couple with two children; two-earner
couple with two children; single parent with two children and a
single person _ at various income levels, ranging from $9,000 to
$125,000.
   Steve Gold of Denver, a spokesman for the National Conference of
State Legislatures, praised the thoroughness of the study but
issued one caution.
   ``If in any one of the 12 scenarios, the tax system became less
progressive, the study counted the system less progressive _ even
if in 11 of the 12 cases it was more progressive,'' Gold said. ``On
balance, the system was made more progressive in every state.''
   The report does not compare actual dollars of taxes paid in the
states, but deals only with distribution of the burden among
taxpayers with low, middele and upper incomes.
   Most states adopt the federal definition of taxable income. The
1986 broadening of the federal tax base by elimination or reduction
of several deductions thus gave the states more income to tax. The
increase in taxable income was accompanied by federal rate
reductions _ producing a tax cut for most people _ but that formula
was not followed by all the states.
   The study found that states ``were much more successful in
shifting the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy than from the
middle class to the wealthy.'' Ten states worsened the relative
burden on some poor families compared with wealthy families of the
same size while 19 shifted a part of the burden from the upper
levels to middle-income taxpayers.
   The study found that:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Of the 41 states (including the District of Columbia) with
broad income taxes, all but New Jersey, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania significantly changed their systems last year.
   _In 17 states, the changes resulted in a more progressive
system, meaning more relief in percentage terms at lower incomes.
These states: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri,
Montana, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.
   _Progressivity declined for many low- and middle-income
households in 21 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   _The significance of the changes in distribution varies widely
from state to state, because state tax laws are so different. For
example, progressivity was barely improved in Illinois because
capital gains _ a form of income held mostly by the well-to-do _
already were fully taxable. Utah improved progressivity
considerably by eliminating the state tax deduction for federal
taxes paid.
   _Only Mississippi imposed no income tax on any of the four
low-income groups studied ($9,000 single parent, $9,000 single
person, $12,000 one-earner couple with children and $12,000
two-earner couple with children).
   _Almost all states could dramatically improve the fairness of
their systems by simply making the state tax a percentage of
federal tax, as Rhode Island, Vermont and North Dakota do.
   _After last year's changes, California, Mississippi, New Mexico,
Maine and Rhode Island have the most progressive income taxes. The
least progressive are in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama and
Pennsylvania.

<TEXT>
   News leaks, protests and Philippine
press commentaries have clouded the atmosphere in talks between
American and Filipino officials on the status of U.S. military
bases here.
   Last Tuesday, the two sides began a three-month review of the
1947 Military Bases Agreement, which allows the United States to
use six military installations in the Philippines.
   U.S. and Filipino officials say the outcome is expected to
influence Manila's decision on whether to allow the bases to remain
after the agreement expires in 1991.
   Both sides have called for a cordial review. But there are
increasing calls in the Philippines for closing the bases and for
asserting nationalism in dealings with the former colonial power.
   On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, chief Philippine
negotiator, reiterated his claim that the bases serve U.S. and not
Filipino interests.
   He also challenged claims by Ambassador Nicholas Platt, chairman
of the U.S. panel, that the installations are vital to counteract
Soviet expansionism.
   ``We are under attack from within, not from without,'' Manglapus
said, referring to communist rebels and right-wing extremists.
``Missiles aimed at some external target do not help us in this
internal struggle. We recognize no enemies but those within our
borders.''
   The atmosphere between the two panels soured early when Filipino
officials leaked details of a dispute over Manila's demand that the
Americans obtain prior consent before launching combat operations
from the bases.
   The U.S. panel boycotted a scheduled session Thursday morning,
and American sources said Platt was furious over the leak.
   But predictably, most Manila newspapers viewed American anger as
an example of Washington pressuring the Filipino panel in the
talks. Commentators urged the Philippine government to stand its
ground.
   ``Our panel should send back a clear message of standing pat on
its commitment to making .. a more equitable arrangement through
primarily gaining a bigger compensation package for the bases' stay
in the Philippines for the duration of the agreement,'' wrote The
Manila Journal.
   Prominent columnist Art Borjal wrote in the Philippine Daily
Star that the Filipino panel has an obligation to bargain for more
Philippine control of the bases. The installations are nominally
under Philippine command, although effectively under U.S. control.
   ``Just about everybody is supporting the view that the
Philippines should protect its sovereignty, stand its ground and
bargain with the Americans as a co-equal nation,'' Borjal wrote.
   Groups opposed to the U.S. bases are planning to take advantage
of the anti-American sentiment to stage more protests.
   On Friday, riot police used clubs and jets of water to stop a
protest outside the U.S. Embassy by about 3,000 people demanding an
end to the American bases.
   Officers attacked when some demonstrators broke away from the
main group and dashed for the embassy. Some people in the crowd
threw stones at police.
   Nationalist sentiment is expected to sharpen when the two panels
take up the sensitive issues of compensation and nuclear weapons.
The Filipinos are expected to demand substantial increases in the
$180 million they receive annually from Washington for use of the
bases.
   A clause in the new Filipino Constitution also states the
Philippines opposes nuclear weapons ``consistent with the national
interest.''
   Legislation has been filed in the Senate to ban nuclear weapons
from the Philippines and bar nuclear-powered ships from ports.
   Because of nationalistic fervor drummed up by the bases talks,
an accidental overflight of the presidential palace by a U.S. Navy
helicopter emerged as a major topic in the local press.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Navy at Subic Bay said the helicopter
inadvertently flew over the prohibited air space last Tuesday
during a delivery flight to the U.S. Embassy. The aircraft flew
across the restricted area a mile north of the palace.
   The Manila Bulletin wrote: ``The unlawful buzzing by a U.S. Navy
helicopter made us think of the human cost exacted, even in
peacetime, by the warmaking machine at Clark and Subic, the
principle involved being that a war machine claims human lives even
when it is idle.''
   On Saturday, Kenneth Quinn, deputy chief of mission at the U.S.
Embassy, apologized for the incident and promised it would not
happen again.

   A military source said today that an Israeli

a Jewish settler but said the army is not ruling out the
possibility she was killed by an Arab.
   Israeli media, citing an army probe, said Friday that
15-year-old Tirza Porat was likely killed by a bullet fired from
the rifle of another Jewish settler.
   The military source said the cause of Tirza's death had not been
determined but added that ``there is a possibility she died from a
bullet.''
   ``If so, there are two possibilities. Either Al Dubi pulled the
trigger after he was stoned (by villagers) or the shot was fired by
an Arab after he took away Al Dubi's M-16,'' the source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Romam Al Dubi was one of two Jewish guards accompanying Israeli
teen-agers on a hike Wednesday near the West Bank village of Beita.
   Tirza was struck in the head by a bullet and a large object
during a clash that broke out between villagers and the hiking
group. The army has previously maintained that she was stoned to
death by Arabs.
   More violence was reported today in the occupied territories.
Hospital officials said an 18-year-old Arab was wounded in the
chest during clashes with Israeli soldiers in the Jabaliya refugee
camp in the Gaza Strip.
   The hospital officials said soldiers firing rubber bullets in
the refugee camp also hit a 60-year-old Arab man below the left eye
and a 50-year-old woman in the stomach.
   The army said it could not confirm the reports.
   In Gaza City, Arabs staged a general strike and hoisted a
Palestinian flag, outlawed by Israel, on the city's main mosque.
Soldiers fired tear gas and live ammunition at youths who threw
stones and burned tires in the city's main thoroughfares.
   On Friday, a firebomb damaged the front porch of the home of
U.S. Consulate spokesman David Good, who said his 5-year-old
daughter and two maids were in the house but that no one was
injured. He said a guard assigned to him by the consulate had been
in the back of the building.
   Since December, the U.S. Consulate building in east Jerusalem
has been firebombed twice, but no one was injured.
   Throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab youths
chanted anti-Israeli slogans and threw rocks at troops after noon
Moslem prayers Friday. Protesters hoisted black flags to
commemorate 141 Arabs killed in the four-month uprising. One
Israeli soldier also has died.
   In Jabaliya, soldiers wounded five Arabs after being stoned by
angry worshipers. Four Arabs were wounded by army gunfire in three
other clashes, hospital officials said.
   The army only would confirm four wounded.
   On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, dozens of Palestinians chanted
nationalist slogans after prayers at the Al Aqsa Mosque. Several
boys tossed rocks at border police who dispersed them without
incident.
   An army official, meanwhile, said the investigation of Miss
Porat's death had not been completed, partly because witnesses
provided conflicting accounts. ``There are 10 different people who
give you 10 different versions,'' he said.
   The army says Arab youths from Beita threw stones at the hikers
and attacked them.
   In the fighting, two Arabs were killed in addition to Miss
Porat, two Arabs were wounded, and 13 Israeli injured.
   Israel radio, citing the army probe, has said Al Dubi opened
fire when the group was first stoned.
   The radio quoted the army report as saying the other guard had
asked Al Dubi not to shoot, but that Al Dubi told the children to
gather around him and started shooting, then was disarmed by Arabs
who took the Israelis to Beita.
   Army officials said a villager handed Al Dubi's weapon, an M-16
rifle, to a soldier on Friday, and Israel TV said eight bullets
were left in the magazine.
   The second weapon, an Uzi submachine gun, was found in the
village Wednesday, and the army said villagers had dismantled it.
   Israeli media, citing the army report, have said the only shots
fired in the clash came from these two weapons, but that
investigators didn't know who pulled the trigger.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, indicated the
struggle centered around the two Israeli guards. He told Israel
radio the investigation showed the villagers did not intend to harm
the Israeli teen-agers.

<TEXT>
   After focusing for nearly a decade on the
deregulation of their own industry, radio and television station
owners are turning their attention to competitive challenges from
cable TV, satellite programming and foreign technology.
   Members of the industry will wrestle with issues like
high-definition TV and carriage of local TV signals by cable
operators at the National Association of Broadcasters convention
this week.
   More than 40,000 broadcasters are expected to attend the
convention, which will include a visit from President Reagan, a
former radio broadcaster and friend of the industry.
   Since Reagan took office in 1981, the Federal Communications
Commission has eased restrictions on buying and selling radio and
TV stations, taken a relaxed view of mergers and acquisitions,
reduced paperwork requirements and made license renewals easier.
   ``Broadcasters feel he's one of us. He understands our
business,'' said Wallace Jorgenson, president of Jefferson-Pilot
Communications Co., Charlotte, N.C., and chairman of NAB's Joint
Board.
   Reagan, scheduled to speak at the convention Sunday, is to
receive an award from NAB for his leadership in broadcast
communications.
   The NAB also will present its distinguished service award, the
industry's highest honor, to former FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler,
who carried out the administration's deregulatory agenda.
   Though broadcasters have been pleased with deregulation, some in
Congress feel it has gone too far, particularly with elimination of
the fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to air conflicting
sides of important issues.
   The FCC's decision to scrap the policy angered Democrats in
Congress and they have promised to try to revive it this year. They
have made it a top priority and have told broadcasters they will
get no legislation they want until the doctrine is made law.
   One of the things broadcasters want most is a requirement that
cable operators carry local TV signals. The courts struck down
previous ``must-carry'' rules.
   Broadcasters are asking Congress for renewed protection of their
signals, and some are willing to live with a fairness doctrine in
exchange.
   ``We broadcasters are sitting in the middle of a fight between
the FCC and Congress,'' Jorgenson said. ``Broadcasters have to
learn they are shooting real bullets at each other and we'd better
keep our heads down right now.''
   Another hot topic at this year's convention is high-definition
TV, called HDTV. The Japanese have a clear lead in developing the
super-picture technology, but the system they plan to introduce in
their own country in 1990 relies upon direct satellite
transmissions to specially designed TV sets. Europeans also have
chosen an HDTV system, but it is not compatible with the Japanese
system.
   The United States is much further behind, and the systems being
developed are still in the computer-simulation stage. One
complication is the number of competing interests who have a stake
in whichever system is ultimately chosen.
   Broadcasters want to make sure that any U.S. industry standard
for HDTV is compatible with existing TV sets, so signals from local
broadcasters can still be received by the 140 million sets that are
now in American households.
   They also see the possibility the Japanese could start selling
HDTV satellite receivers and video-cassette recorders in the United
States, a prospect broadcasters fear could cut deeply into their
audience.

<HEAD>Tutu, Eight Other Bishops Call for End to South African Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   OSHAKATI, South-West Africa (AP) _ Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and eight fellow bishops led a defiant church service Saturday
and called for Namibian independence from South Africa.
   The main preacher, Bishop Bruce Evans, described South Africa's
occupation of the territory as evil, urged Christians to oppose it
and called for the troops' immediate withdrawal from South-West
Africa, commonly known as Namibia.
   ``We say to the South African government, `get out,''' Evans, a
white from South Africa, told about 500 black worshippers. ``We
pray for independence.''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize and the first black
to lead the Anglican church in southern Africa, told the
congregation that two of Evans' sons have been detained in South
Africa for political activity.
   Oshakati is the administrative center of the northern region of
Ovambo, the most populous area of Namibia and the main operational
zone of the South-West African People's Organization guerrilla
movement during its sporadic 22-year-old bush war against South
African rule.
   During their two-day trip to Ovambo, Tutu and his colleagues
have urged the immediate implementation of a 1978 United Nations
resolution calling for U.N.-supervised independence elections.
   Most observers believe such elections would be won by SWAPO,
which is recognized by the U.N. but condemned by South Africa as a
Marxist-oriented terrorist group.
   South Africa says it will not implement the U.N. resolution
until Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola, where they
support the Marxist government in a war against the South
African-backed UNITA rebel movement. Oshakati is a main staging
point for South African forces fighting alongside UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   ``South Africa has taken the military option,'' Tutu said after
the church service. ``It is not interested in negotiations.''
   Tutu condemned the announcement by President P.W. Boha on Friday
that he was broadening the powers of South Africs's chief
representative in Namibia.
   ``You turn the screw tighter and tighter,'' he said of South
Africa, ``and you get less and less control.''
   Among those attending the church service was Peter Kalangula,
leader of the Ovambo regional administration. He has refused to
participate in the South African-installed territorial government
and seeks to maintain good ties with SWAPO supporters.
   Kalangula, who spoke with Botha on Friday in Windhoek, Namibia's
capital, said Botha promised that Defense Minister Magnus Malan and
Army Commander Jannie Geldenhuys would look into allegations of
army atrocities when they visit Oshakati soon.
   The South African Defense Force announced Saturday that two
white soldiers had died Friday from wounds they received in a
bombardment Thursday in the far northern part of the territory. A
military spokesman said the bombardment had been carried out by
SWAPO but gave no other details.

   More than 1,000 police officers, ordered by
the mayor to ``take back the streets,'' raided gang strongholds
today in their biggest attack on drug dealing and street violence
in the nation's second-largest city.
   The task force, the largest to take to the streets of Los
Angeles since the 1984 Olympics, arrested 634 people for
investigation of a variety of offenses, with 334 suspected of being
gang members, said police spokesman Bill Frio. The other 300 were
arrested for a variety of felony and misdemeanor offenses.
   ``We are going to take these terrorists off the streets of Los
Angeles,'' Mayor Tom Bradley, a former police lieutenant, said as
the deployment began. ``We are determined to take back the streets
from these hoodlums.''
   Black-and-white police cruisers raced through South-Central Los
Angeles where gangs hold sway most nights. Every few blocks, a bust
was taking place, with officers swarming around handcuffed youths
as patrol cars blocked the streets.
   In addition to arrests, police early today impounded 96 vehicles
and 10 guns, Frio said.
   Prisoners sat in long lines on benches outside a temporary
booking center at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, manacled and
chained together, waiting their turn for booking at folding tables.
Some were released and others went to jail.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates made a collar of his own, stopping a
man in gang dress, frisking him, and discovering a bottle of
prescription drugs in somebody else's name.
   The man, whose name wasn't immediately released, was held for
investigation of possessing a controlled substance, said Lt. Mark
Leap, noting wryly that ``the troops responded quite favorably.''
   Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon also made an arrest. His
collar was wanted for a parole violation, Frio said.
   The mayor joined Gates in addressing hundreds of shotgun-toting
officers at a roll call at the coliseum, their comments apparently
addressed to violence-weary citizens as well as the officers.
   ``Be gentle with the citizens so they don't feel their
neighborhood is under siege,'' Gates said, promising sterner
measures for lawbreakers. ``We're going to wage a war and it will
be over when the violence is over.''
   About half the special force augmented regular patrols in the
gang-plagued South-Central Los Angeles neighborhoods while the rest
of the officers spread out across the city's four other police
divisions.
   The task force was assembled by putting officers on overtime at
a cost of $150,000 a day, and Bradley vowed to keep spending what
it takes to intimidate the gangs, blamed for 205 killings in the
city of Los Angeles in 1987.
   County-wide, the death toll from gang violence in 1987 was 387,
many of them innocent bystanders caught up in the gangs' trademark
drive-by shootings.
   Officials estimate that there are about 70,000 gang members in
the city, and drug dealing and gang violence have been a fact of
life in the poor, minority neighborhoods of South-Central Los
Angeles.
   But wider attention focused on the problem in February, when a
woman was killed by a stray bullet during a gang showdown in the
affluent, largely white Westwood entertainment district near the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   After a Good Friday attack killed one non-gang member and
injured 12 others on a South-Central Los Angeles sidewalk, Gates
announced plans for the new task force.
   Bradley has budgeted to add 400 new police officers to the
7,000-member force next year, and political opposition to
law-and-order measures aimed at gangs is virtually nonexistent.
   County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has called for military police
units from the National Guard to patrol the worst neighborhoods,
but Gov. George Deukmejian is cool toward the proposal.

<HEAD>Police Say Militant Sikhs May Have Stinger Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh militants may have acquired one or
two U.S.-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and hidden them inside
the Golden Temple, the Sikh faith's holiest shrine, Punjab police
officials said Saturday.
   Possession of the shoulder-fired, heat-seeking missiles would
raise the militants' arsenal to a new level.
   Sikh extremists, who have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982
for greater autonomy or an independent homeland in Punjab state,
generally have relied on knives, swords, pistols and automatic
rifles.
   Their attacks so far this year in Punjab have claimed at least
676 lives, including eight Friday night and Saturday in a
half-dozen attacks across the northern state.
   Last month the extremists used rocket-propelled grenades for the
first time in three attacks on police and paramilitary units.
   Stinger missiles may have been smuggled into the Golden Temple
in trucks carrying rice, milk and other supplies into the complex,
according to police who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 10 Sikh militant groups operate out of the temple complex.
Indian paramilitary units have 17 checkpoints around the Golden
Temple but no troops inside the complex.
   ``Initial intelligence reports suggest the militants inside the
temple may have Stinger missiles with them,'' one senior police
official said.
   Another police official said Sikh separatists inside the temple
were thought to have ``one or two'' Stingers.
   One official said the missiles were ``obviously from Pakistan,''
which borders Punjab state.
   India repeatedly has accused Pakistan of allowing Sikhs to train
and arm on its territory. Pakistan has denied the accusation.
   The United States supplies Stingers through Pakistan to Afghan
guerrillas who have been fighting Soviet troops and the
Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan since 1979. Afghan
guerrilla groups have bases in Pakistan, and huge arm bazaars have
sprung up there.
   Amritsar is about 15 miles east of the Pakistani border.
   Indian police have raided the Golden Temple a dozen times in the
last two years, but such raids are a political as well as a
military risk because Sikhs consider them a desecration of their
holy shrine.
   The late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi launched a major assault
on the temple in 1984 in an effort to dislodge the militants. About
1,200 people died in the raid, prompting Mrs. Gandhi's
assassination by her Sikh bodyguards six months later.
   Since then, the Golden Temple has been a hotbed of the Sikh
separatist movement and a haven for various militant factions.
   Sikhs, whose faith has roots in Hinduism and Islam, are a
majority in Punjab but make up only 2 percent of India's 800
million people. They claim they are discriminated against by
Hindus, who form more than 80 percent of the nationwide population.

   Nearly a year after leaving the top job at the
National Hurricane Center to become a television weatherman, Neil
Frank still has a lot to say about hurricanes.
   Speaking at last week's 10th annual National Hurricane
Conference, Frank and his colleagues lamented the public tendency
to think a hurricane will go exactly where the experts predict.
Frank said viewers overestimate the forecasts they see on
television.
   ``We go out into the broacast media and show these tremendous,
tremendous displays, satellite pictures _ you can put them in false
colors and you can put them in motion _ and you have this
razzle-dazzle display of weather marching across your screen,''
said Frank, whose crew cut and enthusiastic manner became
well-known to the nation when Hurricane Gloria moved up the eastern
seaboard in 1985.
   Frank also spoke out against Air Force plans to stop sending
reconnaissance planes into hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.
Without the flights, he said, ``there's absolutely no way to tell
when a rapid change of strength is occurring.''

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader vows
to criss-cross California in search of enough signatures to put a
proposed ``voter revolt'' insurance initiative on the November
ballot.
   Nader made his pledge Friday at a news conference in this
seaside city after the initiative's supporters said it might be
difficult to gain enough signatures in time to qualify the measure
for the ballot. The deadline for collecting the signatures of
372,178 registered voters is May 19.
   The measure would roll back auto insurance rates as much as 40
percent, regulate state insurance pricing policies and provide for
official consumer representation in the state's rate-setting
process.
   ``There is a need for a voter revolt against the immense
concentration of wealth'' represented in the insurance industry,
Nader said.
   Consumers need a role in regulating insurance rates to see that
``the insurance industry and the state insurance commissioner will
behave themselves,'' he said.

   A state appeals court has refused to
reinstate a breach-of-contract suit against entertainer Dick
Smothers and an associate for withdrawing a $550,000 offer to buy
land for a winery.
   The suit involved Smothers' attempt in 1983 to negotiate for a
1.6-acre site in Sonoma County through an agent to conceal his
identity.
   The agent, based on an oral authorization from Smothers, signed
a purchase agreement with landowner Paul Albert, but while the
money was in escrow, Smothers changed his mind and the agent
requested to cancel the sale.
   Albert refused to cancel, did not offer a deed or take any
further steps to transfer title to the land and sued for the
purchase price.
   In a decision made public Friday, the 1st District Court of
Appeal ruled Albert was not entitled to the purchase price because
he had not fulfilled his duties under the contract.
   Bernard Greenberg, a lawyer for Smothers, called the dispute
``an unfortunate situation'' and said he was pleased by the ruling.
Albert's lawyer, Sandra Shapiro, declined comment.
   Smothers now owns Vine Hill Wines in the Napa County town of
Calistoga and sells wine under the Smothers label with his brother
and comedy partner Tom, who grows grapes and runs a tasting room.

   Senate investigators have stressed anew that
the battle against illicit drugs shipped from Latin America will be
``an uphill fight for a long, long time'' if the government
continues to tolerate foreign leaders who merely wink at the
problem.
   ``This is an enormously profitable business and it has been
aided by several nations who claim to be our friends,'' said Sen.
John F. Kerry, D-Mass., whose Foreign Relations subcommittee on
drugs and terrorism just concluded a second round of hearings on
the issue.
   ``We're going to be fighting an uphill fight for a long, long
time as long as leaders of these countries are allowed to get away
with this,'' said Kerry. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., agreed,
saying ``Drugs are winked at by many governments throughout Latin
America, by high-ranking officials of those countries.''
   The two senators also faulted a lack of coordination in the U.S.
effort, citing testimony which outlined disputes among various
government agencies, including the Customs Service, the FBI, the
Drug Enforcement Administration, and the State Department.
   ``What we have to do is put drugs on the front burner, establish
that it is a priority issue for us in our dealings with these
countries, make those countries know that we will act and act
toughly,'' said D'Amato.
   The most recent testimony focused on the flow of drugs,
particularly cocaine and marijuana, from Colombia and implicated
officials from Honduras, Haiti and Jamaica, in addition to Panama.
The first set of hearings last month focused on Panamanian
strongman Manuel Noriega and his ties to illegal drugs.
   The witnesses, most of them convicted drug dealers, told
detailed stories about night-time flights at treetop level,
backroom cash deals in which few questions were asked and no names
were offered, payoffs were made to officials ranging from county
sheriffs in the United States to top-level officials in Latin
America, and huge profits.
   ``In my line of work, it doesn't pay to ask too many questions
or know too much. I did not ask,'' said George Morales, a convicted
cocaine trafficker.
   Morales was explaining to reporters why he didn't know who owned
the several hundred pounds of cocaine he claimed to have
transported from Costa Rica to Florida two years ago. The drugs
were brought back on a flight in which guns were flown to the
Contra guerrillas, Morales said.
   Kerry said he believes the witnesses, despite their status as
criminals and even though some of them claim the others are lying.
For example, Michael P. Vogel made up so many stories he was known
as ``the liar'' by other members of a smuggling ring, according to
Michael Palmer, a member of the same group.
   ``There's an impressive amount of corroboration in their
stories. Yes, not every single detail matches up, but they are
telling the same stories and those stories are substantiated by the
overwhelming amount of information,'' said Kerry.
   D'Amato also believed the stories. ``I think the detail and the
corroboration in the stories we heard are impressive,'' he said.
   The story told by Gary Betzner was typical of the drug
smugglers. The 47-year-old father of five children testified that
in his home state of Arkansas, he was a civic activist who was
involved in local politics in addition to working as a crop duster.
   Betzner said he became a smuggler for a simple reason _ money.
In an 18-month period, he said, he flew 50 drug flights and was
paid at least $40,000 each. Two other flights, in which he ferried
weapons to Costa Rica for the Contras and returned with a planeload
of drugs, paid him $360,000 each, he said.

<TEXT>
   Li Peng, named to China's top government post on
Saturday, has tried to shake the label of conservative during five
months as acting premier.
   Now that the National People's Congress has confirmed him as
premier, he is expected to press for reforms but at a slower pace
than his predecessor, Zhao Ziyang.
   Li, 59, an electrical engineer by training, lacks Zhao's
personal charisma and tends to be stiff in public appearances.
   His only previous administrative experience came as head of the
power and education ministries. Unlike Zhao, who was governor of
Sichuan, China's most populous province, Li never was responsible
for administration of a region.
   Although he is well-connected _ Li is the adopted son of one of
China's most beloved Communist officials, the late Premier Chou
En-lai _ he is not believed to have a personal power base in the
central government.
   Li has moved slowly in his new job. The reorganization of
government ministries approved by the congress was suggested before
he became acting premier, but he undoubtedly played a large role in
working out details of the shakeup.
   He has tried without success to change his conservative image,
an idea based in part on his years of study in the Soviet Union. He
is believed to favor a slower pace of change than Zhao in China's
campaign to introduce market mechanisms into the economy and
streamline the stagnant bureaucracy.
   Although he has referred to the conservative label as a
``misunderstanding,'' his few statements on policy have reinforced
it. Li has stressed the need for stability in the economy and for
controlling inflation, which reached 7.3 percent last year, even if
the measures slow reform of China's pricing system.
   In a work report to the congress, delivered when it opened its
annual session March 25, Li endorsed the reform program but
repeatedly cautioned against overexpectations and ``rushing
headlong'' into change.
   As premier, Li is responsible for the day-to-day operations of
the government. Zhao, who gave up the premiership to become
Communist Party chief, controls the direction of government
policies.
   Li was born in Chengdu, in southwest China's Sichuan province,
in 1928. His father was killed by Nationalist soldiers during
China's civil war when Li was 3, and he was adopted by Chou En-lai.
   He spent his teen years at Communist Party headquarters in
Yenan, where Mao Tse-tung and Chou directed the Communists'
successful fight against the Nationalists. He joined the party at
age 17.
   From 1948 to 1954 he studied at the hydropower department of the
Moscow Electrodynamics Academy, where he became fluent in Russian.
   After returning home, he held a series of important engineering
posts, including chief engineer of China's largest hydroelectric
complex in Jilin province in the northwest.
   In 1978, Li was promoted to full membership in the party Central
Committee, and in the next year became minister of power industry.
He became vice premier in 1983 and education minister in 1985. The
same year, continuing his climb up the party hierarchy, he became a
member of the Politburo and secretariat.
   He was made a member of the highest decision-making body, the
five-member Politburo Standing Committee, at a party congress last
fall.
   Weeks later, he was appointed acting premier to replace Zhao,
who resigned to take up the leadership of the Communist Party.
   Li has taught himself English. His wife, Zhu Lin, formerly
worked in the Ministry of Water Resources and Electrical Power, and
their two sons and daughter are said to work in the same ministry.

   A Soviet court sentenced a Japanese fisherman to
six months in prison and confiscated the boat of another for
poaching crab in Soviet territorial waters of the Pacific Ocean,
Tass reported Saturday.
   The official news agency said more than 1,000 pounds of crab
were aboard the two boats. It said the crew of one boat had poached
repeatedly, causing ``significant damage'' to the economy of the
Soviet far eastern region.
   Tass did not say when the two were sentenced or where they were
taken into custody, but issued the report from Nakhodka, a Soviet
coastal city nearly 600 miles across the Sea of Japan from Tokyo.
   The boat and equipment of Nagasaki Eshitaka were confiscated,
Tass said. Funakoshi Keiji was sentenced to six months in prison
because the court was guided by ``humane principles and took into
account the difficult circumstances of his family and his sincere
repentance.''
   Both men were fined, but Tass did not name an amount.

<HEAD>Does Justice Nominee Have Mole Or Not?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PETERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The selection of John C. Shepherd to become
deputy attorney general of the United States has focused attention
not so much on his legal credentials as on whether he has a mole on
his upper thigh.
   The question has come up before, during and after a trial in
which Denise Sinner, who used to be the bookkeeper for Shepherd's
law firm, was convicted of stealing nearly $150,000 from the office.
   Shepherd says he doesn't have a mole on his thigh.
   Sinner says she knows he does because they had an affair, and
that during the affair he authorized her to write checks to herself
for the money that was taken.
   Now the FBI is looking into the case because Shepherd, 62, was
picked by Attorney General Edwin Meese to be the No. 2 man in the
Justice Department.
   Also to be checked out are Shepherd's memberships in the
Missouri Athletic Club, which does not accept women, and the
Bellerive Country Club, which has no black members although the
club's bylaws say it is open. Shepherd said last week that he has
not decided whether to resign from the clubs.
   Shepherd, a prominent St. Louis attorney and former president of
the American Bar Association, has insisted that Sinner is lying
about the mole, the affair and authorization to write checks.
   ``Her allegations are absolutely untrue and unfounded,'' he said
last week. ``I am very confident that the FBI's report will bring
this matter to an end.''
   So is the Justice Department.
   ``We were aware of the accusation before the selection was
made,'' said Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland. ``We
understood that it was discredited at the time of the trial and
believe that another investigation of this will show there's
nothing there.''
   Sinner, 29, convicted of stealing $147,000 from the law firm
Shepherd, Sandberg & Phoenix between July 1986 and February 1987,
claimed she and Shepherd met at motels in St. Louis and Chicago.
   ``This woman had no corroboration for any of her testimony,''
said Michael G. Ravetta, the assistant St. Louis circuit attorney
who prosecuted her. ``There wasn't a plane ticket. There weren't
any receipts. No bellhops came forward. There was nothing. Not even
a matchbook from a cheap motel.''
   When Sinner was indicted, she first told investigators she had a
rich boyfriend who had been sending her checks that she'd deposit
into the firm's account. Then she would write checks to herself off
the account, thus avoiding a wait for the boyfriend's checks to be
cleared.
   ``Obviously, the auditors didn't find that to be true,'' Ravetta
said. ``That's when her story changed to the affair with Shepherd.''
   Sinner said Friday that she lied initially to ``buy some time.''
   ``I thought he (Shepherd) would be willing to work something
out,'' she said. ``But that didn't happen. So I decided to tell the
truth.''
   Sinner was hired by Shepherd's law firm through an employment
agency, Ravetta said, and appeared from her resume to be solid for
the job.
   But Sinner's attorney, Darrill S. Beebe, said Sinner, whose
college major was music, was hired because of Shepherd.
   ``A $6 million law firm hires her to take care of the money?''
Beebe asked rhetorically at trial. ``They didn't have a bookkeeper.
They had a Twinkie.''
   Ravetta said Shepherd had nothing to do with the hiring.
   Sinner wrote more than 50 checks to herself before she was
fired. She contended that, in the midst of the affair, Shepherd
authorized her to write the checks to pay bills and buy luxury
items such as a BMW car and a fur coat.
   The jury agreed that it was just ``way too far-fetched'' to
think Shepherd would have authorized Sinner to write the checks,
said juror Jo Anne Candela.
   Even so, Candela said, most of the jurors believed that there
was ``something fishy'' about the way Sinner got the job.
   ``A lot of us thought that maybe she was a con artist,'' Candela
said. ``But we also felt that there had been something there
between her and Shepherd.''
   Sinner is scheduled to be sentenced later this month. After
that, Beebe said, he'll file an appeal that claims, among other
things, that a pre-trial motion to have Shepherd's right leg
examined should not have been turned down.
   Ravetta said Shepherd was willing to undergo the exam. But
Ravetta himself decided to fight the motion because it was too
general.
   ``The motion said he had a mole, birthmark or other skin
imperfection above his right knee,'' he said. ``We just felt that
we could have drawn a star on his leg with a ballpoint pen and she
would have said that's what she saw.''

<HEAD>Playboy Moving To Building In Midst of Address Change Away from 666</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A luxury high-rise some have called the Devil's
Building because of its 666 address will become the new home of
Playboy Enterprises Inc., but the street number will read 680 by
then.
   Playboy President Christie Hefner said Friday her publishing,
video and licensing company has signed a 15-year lease for 100,000
square feet on the 15th and 16th floors of the building, which is
to be called Lake Shore Place as of May 1.
   The new building, which Playboy will enter by the fall of 1989,
will provide the company with more efficient office space, Ms.
Hefner said.
   Six hundred sixty-six North Lake Shore Drive has been called the
Devil's Building or the Mark-of-the-Beast building in reference to
passages from the New Testament book of Revelation, which refer to
a beast with a mark of three sixes.
   But people who live in the building's 400 residential units were
told in a March 1 letter the building's address would change to 680
North Lake Shore Drive as of May 1.
   Spokesmen for the luxury building's owner, a Chemical Bank of
New York subsidiary, and the local management company, Golub & Co.,
said the change was intended to dissassociate the building from the
financial problems of its previous owner, who lost a mortgage
foreclosure battle with the bank last year.
   ``It certainly wasn't us who raised the devil thing,'' said
Michael Schramm, executive vice president of Golub & Co.
   Playboy holds a 10-year lease expiring in 1990 on 10 floors of
the Playboy Building, but the company does not need that space
following the disposal of some businesses in recent years because
of financial problems.
   Playboy's current home was known as the Palmolive Building
before Hugh Hefner, Playboy's founder and Ms. Hefner's father,
bought the leasehold on the structure in 1965. Playboy moved into
the building in 1967, but sold the leasehold in 1980.
   The company rejected moving to Los Angeles, where Hefner now
lives, or to New York, where some Playboy publishing and
advertising executives are based, in favor of staying in Chicago,
Ms. Hefner said.

<TEXT>
   Maoist guerrillas killed two police officers
in Lima on the eve of a visit by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, the Interior Ministry said Saturday.
   Meese, on a weeklong tour to assess anti-drug efforts in Latin
America, planned to be in Peru from Saturday to Monday.
   The attacks late Friday by the Mao-inspired Shining Path
guerrillas shattered weeks of relative calm in the
terrorism-plagued capital.
   In the highlands, where guerrilla violence has increased
recently, Maoist rebels blew up railroad tracks with dynamite
Friday night, derailing a 27-car train hauling zinc from mines to a
refinery, police said Saturday.
   It was the second attack against trains in Peru's most important
rail network in a week and it severed Lima's rail connection with
the highlands.
   Police said there were no injuries in the blast but it would
take several days to make repairs.
   The state railroad company Enafer said in a communique Saturday
that it was seeking help from the army to guard the trains. Enafer
said guerrillas have bombed and derailed 89 trains causing more
than $35 million in damage.
   In the Lima attacks, the police officers were shot to death
Friday evening by groups of three or four rebels, the ministry said.
   The government says more than 10,000 people, including 562
policemen, have been killed in guerrilla violence since the Shining
Path launched an insurgency eight years ago.
   The rebels seek to topple Peru's elected government and install
a worker-peasant state, modeled on the ideas of China's Mao-Tse
Tung.
   Meese has visited the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Ecuador
and is scheduled to travel to Bolivia.

<HEAD>Reagan Underscores Threat to Veto Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Saturday
underscored his threat to veto a sweeping trade bill moving through
Congress, saying the legislation ``could go a long way toward
making America a bad investment.''
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address, said ``we still have very _
underline very _ serious reservations'' about the bill.
   He delivered the remarks from his mountaintop ranch where he has
been spending a 10-day vacation. Reagan will return to Washington
on Sunday, stopping briefly in Las Vegas to address the National
Association of Broadcasters' convention.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, giving the Democratic Party response to the
president's address, urged Reagan to sign the trade measure.
   ``No one suggests that the bipartisan trade bill Congress will
send to the president will solve all of America's problems with
trade and restore our competitiveness,'' said Bentsen, D-Texas.
   ``But we can't do the job without a consistent trade policy to
shield us from protectionist pressures by opening world markets to
American manufactured and agricultural products to create new
opportunities for our service industry, to accord trade policy the
importance it so clearly deserves and to demonstrate that America
is serious about insisting on equal access to world markets,''
Bentsen said.
   The trade bill has been rewritten to delete a key provision that
had drawn administration criticism, the so-called Gephardt
amendment, named for Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. That amendment
would have forced a president under certain circumstances to
retaliate against a country using unfair trade practices.
   But the administration still objects to surviving provisions,
including one that would require businesses to give employees 60
days advance notice of plans to close a plant or work place.
   The administration also opposes a provision that would limit
U.S. sales by Japan's Toshiba Corp. and a subsidiary as punishment
for illegal sales to the Soviet Union of sensitive military
technology.
   Without citing the provisions he dislikes, Reagan said, ``The
bottom line is this: I will veto a bad trade bill before I let a
bad trade bill veto our economy.''
   He said foreign investment in the United States ``isn't
something to be scared of. It brings us a host of benefits,
including jobs and lower interest rates for all Americans. ...''
   ``We can be glad people in other countries choose to invest in
the vibrant and growing U.S. economy rather than their own
nations,'' Reagan said.
   However, he said the trade bill ``could go a long way toward
making America a bad investment for Americans and foreigners
alike.''
   Reagan said the economy is strong, and that the trade bill would
adversely affect U.S. business growth.
   Saying a higher percentage of the labor force is at work than
ever before, Reagan told his listeners, ``I'd love to take the
blame, or the credit, as the case may be, but that just wouldn't be
fair.''
   Reagan said he merely has presided over an administration that
has reduced the government's regulation of business and has brought
about tax cuts, and that the U.S. private sector has taken the
economy ``and run with it.''
   After the radio address, Reagan was presented with a tribute,
the Badge of the American Spirit Medal, from the California
Association of Highway Patrolmen.

   Here is a transcript of President
Reagan's weekly radio address delivered Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, you probably heard that some of our
political opponents are very concerned about the state of our
economy, and I have to tell you, I don't blame them. If I were in
their shoes I'd be worried too.
   You see, April marks the 65th straight month of the longest
peacetime expansion in U.S. history.
   In that time we've created nearly 16 million jobs. They are
better and higher paying too, which is one reason why the real
income of the average American has been rising steadily for the
last five years.
   The percentage of Americans employed is the highest in history,
and the unemployment rate continues to drop down to its lowest
level since 1974. Since 1980, U.S. manufacturing has increased its
productivity almost three times as fast as in the seven previous
years.
   Inflation remains low, while the gross national product growth
this year and last has exceeded even our own optimistic
expectations.
   Somehow our opponents have convinced themselves that this record
growth, vibrant job creation and more productive economy is bad
news, and they say its all the fault of Reaganomics. Well I'd love
to take the blame or credit as the case may be, but that just
wouldn't be fair.
   All we did was get government out of your way. We cut taxes,
inflation and regulations and we let the American people take back
their own economy and run with it.
   In their effort to prove that this economic boom we're in is
really a bust, our opponents have had to weave some pretty tall
tales.
   One of those they tell about America is that we're threatened by
foreign investment.
   Well, to paraphrase what Joe Friday used to say in ``Dragnet,''
``Let's just look at the facts, Ma'am.'' Yes, foreigners now hold
about 12 percent of U.S. public debt, but that's down from 16
percent in 1978. Foreign resources also accounted for 10 percent of
total credit market funds last year, exactly the same as in the mid
1970's.
   But even so, foreign investment isn't something to be scared of.
It brings us a host of benefits including jobs and lower interest
rates for all Americans whether they be home buyers, small
businessmen, consumers or farmers.
   Writer@economist Warren Brooks makes a very good point. ``What
difference does it make,'' he asks, ``whether a Japanese company
owns a factory in Detroit or in Marysville, Ohio? Does someone
seriously think they might dismantle it brick by brick and ship it
back to Japan in the middle of the night?''
   I wonder if the workers in those plants think foreign investment
is such a bad thing, or the nearly three million other Americans
employed by foreign firms in the United States whose payrolls add
up to more than $70 billion and they pay about $8 billion in income
taxes to the United States Treasury. The fact is we live in a
global economy.
   We can be glad people in other countries choose to invest in the
vibrant and growing U.S. economy rather than their own nations.
   I don't blame them. I think America's a pretty good investment
too.
   Right now, however, there's a trade bill working its way through
Congress that could go a long way toward making America's bad
investment for Americans and foreigners alike. At this moment,
we've not seen the final bill. But from what we already know, we
still have very -- underline ``very'' -- serious reservations.
   We'll continue to work with the full Congress and the
congressional leadership to clear up these problems.
   But the bottom line is this -- I will veto a bad trade bill
before I will let a bad trade bill veto out economic expansion.
   Another important matter facing the nation today is the INF
Treaty, which I signed with General Secretary Gorbachev at our
Washington Summit meeting last December.
   This treaty will, for the first time, eliminate an entire class
of US and Soviet missiles. We called this the ``Zero Option'' when
I first proposed it in 1981.
   The treaty also requires the Soviet Union to make far greater
reductions now in its missile systems to reach equality with
us.This is an historic precedent, and we will apply it to other
arms negotiations as well.
   Finally, the treaty has the most comprehensive verification
regime in arms control history. This, too, is an important
precedent for other negotiations, particularly those on strategic
arms where an even more elaborate verification regime will be
required.
   In sum, this treaty represents what can be accomplished when we
negotiate from a position of strength.
   Action on it is now up to the United States Senate which must
give its advice and consent to ratification. I hope it will be
given expeditious consideration by the full Senate, and I urge all
senators to provide their advice and consent without reservation.
   It is a solid treaty, that it enhances the security of our
country and our allies.
   Until next week then, thank you for listening and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   The Arab hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner
today shot and killed a Kuwaiti security guard on the plane and
then freed another captive after officials refused to refuel the
jet, authorities said.
   The identity of the man released was not immediately known, but
government spokesman Akis Fantis said he was about 25 years old and
unwell. Fantis said he was taken by ambulance to a hospital in
Larnaca.
   He gave no other details.
   Photographers at Larnaca airport said the man was seen leaving
the plane with a senior Palestine Liberation Organization
negotiator and two Cypriot officials after their fourth meeting
with the hijackers.
   Earlier, the body of a man who had been killed, his hands tied
behind his back, was tossed onto the tarmac. An ambulance took the
body away.
   A stairway was then rolled out to the plane. The PLO's deputy
director in Cyprus, Malaz Abdo, and the Cypriot officials stood on
the top step, talking to a hijacker standing in the doorway of the
jet, just behind the cockpit.
   The hijackers and negotiators held four separate meetings
lasting a total of more than 1{ hours before the captive was freed.
   There was no immediate word on what was said at the plane.
   Fantis said the man was freed ``as a sign of good will by the
hijackers.''
   Fantis identified the dead man _ apparently the hijackers' first
victim _ as a young Kuwaiti security guard. He said an X-ray and
pathologist's examination showed the man was shot three times in
the head and had a broken neck.
   Earlier, the pilot said the gunmen were beating passengers.
About 55 people, including at least half a dozen hijackers, were
aboard the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 on the fifth day of the ordeal.
   The radioed message that the guard had been killed came at 11:32
a.m. (4:32 a.m. EDT), two minutes after a deadline set by the
gunmen for refueling.
   The tower had previously radioed that airport workers were
afraid to approach the plane, which the hijackers had warned they
would blow up if security men tried to move in.
   At 11 a.m., Director of Civil Aviation Michael Herodotou told
the hijackers by radio that he needed more time to negotiate with
the fuel workers, ``who are afraid to approach you.''
   A hijacker accused the tower of ``misleading'' him throughout
the night with bogus excuses for refusing to provide fuel. He also
said Kuwait would be responsible for the consequences.
   The hijackers' main demand is the release of 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists convicted in Kuwait of bombing the U.S. and French
embassies there in 1983. Kuwait refuses.
   The threat to kill a passenger followed a message from the tower
appealing to the hijackers ``for the release of passengers so the
refueling people can come to refuel your aircraft.''
   The hijackers started beating some of their captives early today
after authorities failed to meet an earlier deadline to refuel the
plane, the pilot told the tower.
   Asked if he could see the beatings, the pilot replied
``affirmative.''
   The hijackers earlier said six of the passengers were ``sick''
and that the Cypriots' refusal to refuel the jetliner ``is causing
the sickness,'' airport officials said.
   Tower officials had told the hijackers by radio that ground
crews were afraid to approach the jet and urged them to free some
of their captives ``persuade them ... to refuel.''
   The hijackers' spokesman snapped back: ``No way. We've given you
enough time. Our patience is running out.''
   The plane landed at Larnaca on Friday night after seven hours in
the air. After the plane had left Mashhad, Iran, Syria and Lebanon
refused to allow it to land. The pilot said its fuel tanks were
near empty when it landed in Larnaca.
   The plane was commandeered Tuesday on a flight from Bangkok to
Kuwait and 57 passengers were freed in Mashhad.
   Cypriot officials said the hijackers had today demanded 100,000
pounds of fuel, the plane's capacity, and were told they would have
to free some of the passengers first.
   A hijacker snapped back sharply: ``No passengers will be
released.'' Then he switched off.
   Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou warned early today that
negotiations with the hijackers ``could take days.''
   The hostages include about 30 Kuwaitis, three of them members of
the Persian Gulf emirate's large ruling Al-Sabah family. The three
have been identified as Fadel Khaled al-Sabah, and his sisters
Anware and Ebtesam, distant relatives of the emir, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
   The hijackers put one of them, identified as Anware, on the
radio when the jetliner was circling over Beirut to plead with the
tower in a choking voice: ``I beg you, allow us to land. We have no
fuel left.''

   Here is a transcript of the response Saturday
by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to President Reagan's weekly radio
address:
   On behalf of hundreds of Democrats and Republicans in Congress,
I want to invite President Reagan to stop brandishing his veto pen
and accept the hand of friendship, and work with us to fashion
fair, effective trade policies that will help America prosper in
the 21st century.
   Late last week House and Senate negotiators agreed on the
outlines of comprehensive legislation that would finally establish
trade policy as an urgent national priority. It would put the world
-- and our own government -- on notice that trade will no longer be
the neglected stepchild of American policy.
   Its objective would be that countries which have full access to
our market should grant us full access to their markets. This
legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support.
   There are those who believe this bill doesn't do enough and
there are those who prefer that we do nothing, who like to conjure
up images of the discredited Smoot-Hawley Tariff. That's unfair.
It's like saying that anyone who supports a strong national defense
is a warmonger.
   And in this instance it's especially unfair because the
compromise trade bill is designed to resist protectionism by
opening world markets and enforcing trade laws.
   Later this month, we'll tie up the loose ends of the
legislation, bring it to a vote in Congress and send it to the
White House.
   I would hope the president will sign it in the same spirit of
bipartisanship which prevailed after the October 19 stock market
crash six months ago. At that time we all sat down together --
Republicans and Democrats, White House and Congress. We set aside
narrow, partisan political differences. And we hammered out some
honest answers to the difficult problem of deficit reduction.
   Today, we have an opportunity to take the same approach to the
equally important problem of the trade deficit. We just can't
afford to be lulled into a false sense of security by the recent,
welcome surge in American exports. Monthly or quarterly economic
snapshots don't accurately describe how trade has been a tragedy
for the American worker during this decade.
   Let me give you an example of what I mean. Since 1981, our
exports have stagnated while our imports have increased by 60
percent. That's why we had a $171 billion trade deficit last year.
   This failure of exports to keep pace with imports has cost
American dearly. If exports had grown only one-third as rapidly as
imports, we would have created a million and a half jobs for
American workers.
   But jobs are only part of the story. Our soaring trade deficits
have been matched by soaring international debt. Four years ago,
America was the world's largest creditor nation. Today, we are the
largest debtor nation, with international obligations of over $400
billion. We owe more money than Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and
Venezuala combined.
   For many years trade has ``sat below the salt'' when it comes to
American policy and during the past seven years of growing trade
deficits it hs remained there. Foreign policy, monetary policy,
strategic policy have all taken precedence over trade. Random,
ineffective protectionist actions have served as a surrogate for
trade policy.
   No one suggests that the bipartisan trade bill Congress will
soon send to the president will solve all of America's problems
with trade and restore our competitiveness.
   But we can't do the job without a consistent trade policy to
point us in the right direction, to shield us from protectionist
pressures by opening world markets to American manufactured and
agricultural products, to create new opportunities for our service
industries, to accord trade policy the importance it so clearly
deserves and to demonstrate that America is serious about insisting
on equal access to world markets.
   The trade bill we'll send to the president gives America the
tools we need to do a very difficult, important job. It is the
bipartisan product of consultation and compromise. It will help
produce a stronger, more competitive American presence in the world
markets.
   So, with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I urge the
president to sign the trade bill and join Congress in creating an
effective, bipartisan American response to the challenge of trade.

   Private pleas from Arabs and Israelis and his
own instincts keep Secretary of State George P. Shultz engaged in a
Middle East peace effort that has produced little progress so far.
   Shultz left the troubled region Friday, vowing to return,
convinced that all the key parties _ Israel, Jordan and Palestinian
Arabs _ want to work out a settlement.
   He refused to be sidetracked by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's resistance to a symbolic peace conference that would
launch the negotiations. Nor was he unnerved by a government
statement in Amman only hours after he left that Jordan would not
stand in for the Palestinians.
   Shultz said ``Israelis are as interested in peace and stability
as Jordan and the Palestinians, perhaps even more so.'' He
suggested the Jordanian statement was designed for public
consumption and did not reflect a more amenable stand taken
privately by King Hussein.
   Two of the basic elements in Shultz's plan are a peace
conference and exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
He said in an interview in Amman that the PLO sought to exterminate
Israel. Officials kept it off the air.
   Shultz would have Palestinians at the table, but as part of a
delegation with Jordan. He publicly opposed establishment of a
Palestinian state in the blacked-out interview.
   In Jerusalem, Shultz tried to convince Shamir that the peace
conference he opposed was not the one Shultz had in mind. The
Israeli leader does not want to give the Soviet Union an
opportunity to tilt a settlement in the Arabs' favor. Shultz told
him the United States would not let that happen.
   But Shamir held fast to his position, even though Shimon Peres,
the Israeli foreign minister, called negotiations within the
framework of a peace conference ``the only hope in town.''
Otherwise, Peres warned, the outlook in the region was bleak.
   Shamir's apprehension and Hussein's approval of a public policy
statement that implied criticism of Shultz's position reflect the
mistrust that hung over the five-day mission like a dark cloud.
   Shamir and other skeptical Israelis doubt there is an Arab
partner ready to follow the course taken a decade ago by the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and make peace with the Jewish state.
   These Israelis are convinced Sadat and the late Lebanese
President Bashir Gemayal, who also sought peace with his neighbor,
were assassinated for extending an olive branch to Israel.
   Many times in the past Hussein has stepped to the brink of
negotiations and then faltered. Peres and Israelis who share his
trust in the king, are convinced this time the king means it.
Shultz urged the Israelis to consider Hussein their ``possible
partner'' in peace.
   On the Arab side, meanwhile, there are many obstacles in
Shultz's way.
   After the 1967 Six-Day war, in which the Arabs took an
embarrassing drubbing from the vastly outnumbered Israelis and lost
the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, the
Arabs vowed not to negotiate or recognize Israel.
   In 1974, they declared the PLO to be the Palestinians' sole,
legitimate representative. The PLO undertook a terrorism campaign
against Israel, the United States and moderate Palestinians.
   The Arab positions, and a basic resistance to a Jewish state in
the Middle east, are formidable roadblocks to Shultz.
   Moreover, Shamir and Peres would retain at least part of the
West Bank. Shultz told the Arabs candidly that recovering all of
the lost territory simply was not ``in the cards.''
   And yet, Shultz said he would not give up.
   Frequently describing himself as stubborn, Shultz said he could
feel it in his bones that the Arabs and Israelis eventually will
come around.
   ``Who's afraid to struggle against odds?'' he said Friday in
Amman. ``You have to be willing to do it. What am I saving myself
for anyway?
   ``I've got a few more months to go here and I want to try to
leave something constructive for the region and for my successors.
So I am going to put my back into it, why not?''

<TEXT>
   A court ruled Saturday that the government
may confiscate several million dollars in assets that Anwar Sadat's
brother and 10 family members were convicted of acquiring through
corruption.
   The court exempted from the takeover several cars and some
jewelry and real estate but allowed the seizure of bank accounts
and some property.
   Esmat Sadat, brother of the slain Egyptian president, said he
would appeal on behalf of himself, three of his sons and seven
other relatives involved in the case.
   He said the case was politically motivated and aimed at smearing
his brother's name and presidential tenure.
   The 11 were charged in 1982, a year after Anwar Sadat's
assassination, with amassing millions of dollars through influence
peddling, bribery and other corruption. At that time, their
property was sequestered for five years.
   They were convicted on 24 counts of influence peddling, black
marketeering and bribery.
   The court said that there was no evidence the president was tied
in any way to illicit activities.
   Early this month, the nation's prosecutor general demanded
confiscation of $8.2 million worth of property, exempting from the
request a car and an apartment for each defendant.
   Saturday's court session was for the reading of the verdict.
Flanked by two of his sons, Esmat Sadat sat quietly fingering worry
beads and waited for Sayed Abdel-Baky, president of the seven-man
tribunal, to read it.
   ``This is politics, this is a public opinion case, and I
expected no less,'' Sadat told reporters afterward. ``Many others
were let off without confiscation. Why us?''
   Esmat Sadat went into private business in 1973 during his
brother's third year as president after 30 years as a bus company
employee. His salary when he left the company was about $100 a
month.

<HEAD>U.S. Receives Soviet Response On Afghan Aid Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a week of waiting, the United States on
Saturday received a written Soviet response to a Reagan
administration proposal for continued superpower military support
for the factions in Afghanistan, U.S. officials said.
   And Secretary of State George P. Shultz, as he studied the
response, considered a trip to Geneva this week to attend the
signing of a long-awaited accord ending Soviet troop presence in
Afghanistan.
   The United States had called on Moscow to confirm in writing
that it accepted the U.S. compromise on the issue of military
assistance to Afghan elements after the Soviets carry out a plan to
remove their estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan.
   No details of the Soviet response were revealed. However, the
Soviets, earlier this week, were reported to have informally
accepted the U.S. proposal.
   Sondra McCarty, a State Department spokeswoman, said Shultz had
received a response from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and ``it's being studied,''
   The reply was turned over to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and
cabled to Washington, said another U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. He said Shultz may go to Geneva to join
Shevardnadze at the signing ceremony of a comprehensive
U.N.-sponsored Afghan settlement.
   Shultz returned Friday night from a grueling, five-country,
six-day, trip to the Middle East and has already scheduled an April
19-26 trip that will take him to Moscow to prepare for President
Reagan's May 29-June 2 summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez announced on Friday after six years
of negotiations that an accord was ready for signature by
representatives of Pakistan and the warring Afghan government and
resistance forces.
   Under the accord, the Soviets would start pulling their troops
out of Afghanistan on May 15 and complete the withdrawal in nine
months, with half the Soviet soldiers leaving in the first three
months.
   Afghan refugees, mostly in Pakistan, would be allowed to return
home, and Afghanistan would become a neutral and nonaligned nation
under U.S. and Soviet guarantees.
   The U.S. proposal permits the superpowers to continue military
support for their clients in Afghanistan: the Moscow-backed
government in Kabul and the Mujahedeen rebels who have been
receiving U.S. weapons.
   Shultz had hoped the Soviets would agree to a mutual cutoff of
aid to the factions in Afghanistan, but the Soviets asserted their
right to keep supplying the Kabul government so the United States
suggested an agreement on mutual continuation of aid.
   Officials in Washington said the deal could eventually lead to a
cessation of aid. If the Soviets decide to stop assisting the
Afghan government, the United States might be prepared to follow
suit with a ``symmetrical'' cessation of its aid to the resistance.
   U.S. aid, including portable Stinger antiaircraft missiles said
to have downed hundreds of Soviet helicopters and planes, has been
credited by resistance leaders and U.S. officials as the key
assistance element that permitted Afghan guerrillas to wage
effective campaigns against the Soviet troops.
   Moscow sent its army into Afghanistan in December 1979 to take
control of anti-guerrilla operations the pro-Soviet Afghan army had
been waging ineffectively and to oust a Kabul government whose
support for Soviet policies was wavering.

   Victor Posner, one of the nation's highest paid
executives who runs a multibillion-dollar business empire, has
traded the executive suite for the mean streets as he embarks on a
court-ordered campaign to aid the homeless.
   Posner pleaded no contest in February to a charge of income tax
fraud for inflating the value of a land donation. He was sentenced
to fund a $3 million program to study the extent of homelessness in
south Florida and come up with some solutions.
   In addition, since his sentencing the 69-year-old Posner has
spent one day a week as a volunteer at Camillus House, a Miami
shelter for the down-and-out.
   ``Since February I have been studying and learning about the
problems of the homeless both nationally and in Florida,'' Posner
told U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman last week.
   But the practical businessman noted, ``All the studies in the
world will not help one homeless person. ... You must give the
homeless a home so they will feel like people, not animals.''
   The self-made industrialist, who dropped out of high school at
13, runs a 40-company empire that has been valued at about $4
billion. Business Week named him the nation's top-paid chief
executive for 1985 with an estimated salary of $12.7 million. In
1986 he slipped to third, at $8.4 million.
   His legal troubles, however, took him from the rarefied
atmosphere of high finance to helping on the bread line at Camillus
House.
   Brother Paul Johnson, the Roman Catholic clergyman who runs
Camillus House, said Posner's eyes have been opened by the
experience, which the judge ordered as part of his probation.
   ``I was surprise and pleased,'' said Johnson. ``He was quite a
bit concerned with the people.''
   Posner serves food, hands out clothing and signs people into the
shelter at night, Johnson said. But the Alcoholics Anonymous and
substance abuse meetings seem to have affected the high-powered
businessman the most.
   ``He commented that the guys were intelligent,'' he said. ``I
think he was very surprised about that _ it made him realize they
really are victims of substance abuse.''
   Johnson said Posner's instincts are generous, almost to a fault.
At one point the clergyman kidded the multimillionaire about giving
out too much bread on the food line.
   ``He was giving them all they wanted,'' said Johnson. ``He told
me I could always get more.''
   Posner has shown his generosity before. He donated $100,000 to a
fund for Ronnie DeSillers, a Miami boy who died last year in
Pittsburgh after three unsuccessful liver transplants. DeSillers'
mother, Maria, is accused of misusing some of the funds raised for
her son.
   But Posner has also shown an insensitivity that angers his
detractors.
   After his first conviction on fraud charges _ which was later
thrown out because jurors had received outside information about
the case _ Posner said: ``These people on the jury are making $150
a week. They're poor people. They just don't understand.''
   The U.S. attorney's office denounced Posner's sentence to
charity as a slap-on-the-hand for wrongdoing that could have sent
Posner to prison for 40 years.
   ``Laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be, we
submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of
justice, and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for
liberty while the poor cannot,'' U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner said
last Monday in a motion challenging the sentence.
   Posner and his attorney, well-known Washington lawyer Edward
Bennett Williams, told Spellman they would go ahead with the $3
million homeless project, whether or not that part of the sentence
was upheld. Williams must reply formally within 30 days to
Kellner's motion.
   The project will be monitored by Spellman and a 10-member
blue-ribbon committee of prominent area residents. The first part,
due to be finished by May 16, is a census of the homeless in Dade,
Broward and Palm Beach counties, who they are, and what resources
are available to them.
   Next, Posner said, should come some kind of pilot program that
shows what can be done.
   ``I will come to you with what will solve the problem,'' Posner
told the judge.
   Although he's paying for the study, Posner emphasizes it was
mandated by the judge, and the industrialist clearly is more
interested in the project itself. He is already talking up
federally subsidized housing plans as a realistic approach to help
the homeless.
   Sister Jeanne O'Loughlin, president of Barry Univeristy, which
is administering the study, said she hopes the money and attention
Posner is giving to the homeless will be the catalyst for what
could become a $300 million program. And she said she expects
Posner to stay involved.
   ``He has a very fast mind,'' she said. ``He's creating solutions
even before we give him all the data.''

   Trailed by a large crowd, the tall,
dark stranger definitely had a way about him as he strolled through
town, staring into shop windows.
   Clearly, this was not your ordinary, 200-pound black bear. He
was shopping for groceries in the 5,000-population community, and
until Thursday night hadn't done too badly for himself.
   ``They had to block off streets,'' said Cloverdale police
dispatcher Shauna Tipler. ``Not to keep the bear from the people,
but the people from the bear. They loved it. It was comical. There
was this bear walking around town followed by a huge crowd.''
   It was the young bear's third straight nocturnal visit to this
town 80 miles north of San Francisco. His earlier trips won him
meals of chickens and ducks, but the bear's third foray from the
forest proved unlucky.
   After a state Department of Fish and Game trap failed, a citizen
committee of ad hoc vigilantes chased the bruin 35 feet up a tree,
where a police sharpshooter shot him with a tranquilizer gun. The
groggy beast hung onto a branch for about 10 minutes before falling
into a giant canvas held by about 20 people.
   The snoozing bear got a free ride to a holding cage at Rancho
Cordova near Sacramento and will be released into the wild later,
Fish and Game spokesman Jim Swanson reported.
   ``It's just a young foolish bear,'' said Swanson. ``He's just a
kid.''

   It took only a single anonymous vote, but an
Illinois State University student wasn't complaining about the
unexpected launch of his political career.
   Diego Alvarado, 24, of Normal received one write-in vote for
McLean County circuit clerk in the March 15 Democratic primary. No
one else ran for the nomination and another person who received a
write-in vote declined it.
   Alvarado said Friday he would run in the November general
election for the clerk's office, which employs 55 people and keeps
track of court paperwork.
   ``I take this step because I believe the circuit clerk's office
should work primarily to serve the public,'' Alvarado said Friday.
   The political science junior has never held an elected public
office, but he was a delegate for Gary Hart at the 1984 Democratic
National Convention in San Francisco and has been active in campus
political groups.
   ``I feel I have something to offer the voters,'' he said. ``It's
been in my mind to run for office. And I've been involved in
politics all my life.''
   McLean County Democratic Party chairman John Penn welcomed
Alvarado's decision to run, but the Republican nominee, 40-year-old
Sharon Siron, expressed some disappointment..
   ``There was no one on the Democratic ticket at the time of the
primary, and I was hoping I wouldn't have a race in November,'' she
said. ``But I hear it's fun to campaign all summer.''

<TEXT>
   Isham, Lincoln & Beale, a law firm co-founded by
Abraham Lincoln's son, is succumbing to internal strife and closing
its doors after 116 years.
   ``This has been a trying experience and one of the most
regrettable results I've seen in my life,'' said Richard Marcus, a
well-known labor attorney and partner in the firm.
   He said Friday that partners voted to dissolve their practice
two years after a merger with a younger firm that proved ``a dismal
failure.''
   The Isham-Lincoln partnership was founded in 1872 by Edward
Isham, son of a Vermont Supreme Court justice, and Robert Todd
Lincoln, a Harvard-educated lawyer who later became U.S. war
secretary and U.S. minister to Great Britain.
   The firm's clients have included Commonwealth Edison Co.,
McDonald's Corp., Tribune Co., Fireman's Fund Corp., CBS Inc. and
National Broadcasting Co. Inc.
   But its financial difficulties became public in 1986, when the
conservative firm merged with the younger and more aggressive
Reuben & Proctor in what was the largest law firm merger in Chicago
history.
   The amalgam, which retained the Isham name, initially had 225
attorneys. But by Friday, only 80 were left.
   ``There was an inescapable feeling that there was no longer any
sense of cohesiveness, which is absolutely essential for a firm to
stay together, grow and attract new clients,'' said Marcus, who
will lead a small group of attorneys in joining the firm of
Sonnenschein Carlin Nath & Rosenthal.
   ``It certainly indicates how transitory human organizations are
and how important it is to be mindful of the human fabric,'' said
Max Wildman, lead partner in another major Chicago law firm,
Wildman Harold Allen & Dixon.
   ``With such distinguished lineage, it's most regrettable,''
Wildman said.

<TEXT>
   White House chief of staff Howard
Baker conceded Saturday that economic sanctions against Panama have
``hurt the people more than they have hurt'' strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   But Baker called the measures ``carefully thought out and
carefully executed'' and said they were unavoidable.
   ``We grieve for the people of Panama'' Baker told reporters. He
said, though, that U.S. officials hope the new economic sanctions,
announced on Friday, will further undermine Noriega's hold on power.
   The chief of staff also acknowledged that a series of economic
sanctions taken against Noriega to this point have had little
effect on the general.
   This contradicted Baker's statement of Friday, in which he told
reporters he thought the punitive measures by the United States had
left the Panamanian strongman a ``beleaguered and de facto leader''
of the Central American nation.
   On Saturday, Baker acknowledged that the sanctions, for the most
part, had wreaked havoc with the Panamanian economy.
   ``General Noriega, no doubt, has money squirreled away, who
knows where, and, and I doubt very much that we have done much to
interrupt his lifestyle or to diminish his assets,'' the chief of
staff said.
   ``And it does hurt the people of Panama, and the people of
Panama are the ones that have been hurt for a long time by the
authoritarian rule of General Noriega and by his drug trafficking
to their detriment,'' Baker added. ``And we regret that. ... We're
extremely concerned about not only the security of the canal and
the security of Americans, but also the welfare of the people of
Panama. ...
   ``But the answer to that is the resumption of constitutional
government in that country,'' he said, ``and it is our fervent hope
that that will occur soon and occur in a satisfactory way.''
   Whereas a senior administration official early last week
suggested that dissident elements in the Panamanian Defense Forces
might force Noriega out, Baker indicated Saturday the invocation of
emergency economic powers by Reagan might invite the Panamanian
people to demonstrate for Noriega's removal.
   Baker said Reagan's decision to use the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act to further impede the flow of U.S. dollars to
Panama will have ``far-reaching consequences'' and said ``the
president's hope is that it also will have a convincing effect on
the people of Panama and on General Noriega.''
   But Baker acknowledged that the steps taken to put pressure on
Noriega ``undoubtedly hurt the people of Panama more than they hurt
him.''
   Noriega has clung to power despite one coup attempt in Panama
and increasing political, military and economic pressure from the
United States.
   Baker said he did not put much stock in reports of Marxist
intervention on Noriega's behalf, saying, ``I don't know that
there's anything going on that's particularly alarming or
particularly different, but we're keeping very close touch with
it.''
   Last week, the Washington Times reported that an international
Marxist brigade of up to 1,200 troops had gone into Panama to help
protect Noriega. But U.S. officials said they had no confirmation
of that.
   Baker also refused to speculate on what options Reagan might
elect if the latest economic sanctions do not succeed.
   ``The president of the United States does not signal in advance
what his next steps, if any, will be,'' Baker said.
   The chief of staff laid much of the problem in Panama to
Noriega's alleged involvement with drug-peddling.
   Noriega has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
drug-trafficking charges, and there have been some suggestions
within the administration that the United States would not seek to
extradite and try the Panamanian strongman if Noriega fled to a
third country.
   ``The drug component is bigger than almost anybody imagines,''
Baker said, adding:
   ``The international drug cartels are so big and so powerful and
have so permeated the governments of some of the countries of this
hemisphere, that it becomes a threat to the national security of
this nation.''
   ``We are addressing that,'' Baker said. ``The president is
addressing the situation aggressively. The first lady (Nancy
Reagan) has addressed it aggressively. It is a component in our
concerns about Central America.''
   ``It is not something that will be solved easily or quickly,''
he said. ``It is a situation that, as we approach a solution, will
produce resistance from those who are deeply engaged in the drug
business. But the drug business is awful. The drug business is
destructive to our lifestyle and the security of this country, and
we've simply got to face it for what it is.''

   Here is a chronology of events in the hijacking of Kuwait
Airways Flight 422.
   TUESDAY, April 5 _ The Boeing 747 with 112 people aboard,
including three members of the Kuwaiti royal family, is hijacked by
Arabs on a flight to Kuwait from Bangkok and diverted to Mashhad in
northeastern Iran. The hijackers demand freedom for 17 pro-Iranian
extremists jailed in Kuwait for their convictions in the bombings
of the U.S. and French embassies there in 1983. They threaten to
blow up the plane if the demand is not met. Kuwait refuses. One
passenger with heart condition is released. Kuwait asks Iran not to
allow the plane to take off.
   WEDNESDAY, April 6 _ Kuwait sends a team to Iran to negotiate
with the hijackers but vows not to yield to their demands. The
hijackers release 24 women passengers and call a doctor on board to
treat passengers they describe as ``unwell.''
   THURSDAY, April 7 _ The hijackers release 32 more hostages and
again threaten to blow up plane if security forces attempt ``any
threat against the plane.'' The plane is refueled after hijackers
fire on airport security guards and threaten to force the plane to
take off with fuel tanks near empty.
   The gunmen agree to give the prime ministers of Turkey and
Pakistan until early Friday to negotiate with Kuwait to try to end
ordeal.
   FRIDAY, April 8 _ The deadline passes while Turkish and
Pakistani prime ministers negotiate with Kuwaiti officials. The
plane leaves Mashhad but is refused permission to land in Syria and
Lebanon, despite pleas from the pilot who says the fuel tank is
nearly empty. After seven hours in the air, the plane lands at
Larnaca, Cyprus.
   SATURDAY, April 9 _ The hijackers kill a Kuwaiti security guard
on the plane and toss his body onto the tarmac after their demands
for more fuel are not met. The pilot reports that captives are
being beaten. The PLO's deputy director in Cyprus and two Cypriot
officials go to the plane and talk with hijackers. After a fourth
round of talks, one captive is freed.
   Cypriot official warns negotiations with hijackers ``could take
days.''

<HEAD>Miami Man Convicted Of Killing Partner To Finish Sentence In
Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A businessman who was a member of the
secret army that won Israel's independence has been granted
clemency to complete his Florida murder sentence on a kibbutz in a
deal with the state Cabinet.
   William Shapiro, 62, of Miami, has served 13 years of his life
sentence but plans to board an El Al jet Monday evening in Miami
and renounce his U.S. citizenship upon arriving in Israel, his
attorney, Alvin Lodish, said Saturday.
   High officials in the Israeli government, Florida legislators
and others sought clemency for New York-born Shapiro, citing a lack
of credibility in the evidence that put him in prison for the
murder of business partner Burt deWitt.
   They argued a man with Shapiro's distinguished background as a
combat officer in the U.S. Marines during World War II and the
Korean War, as a 12-year veteran and ballistics officer with the
Israeli National Police and as a liberator of Israel could not have
been guilty of murder.
   ``The evidence just wasn't very strong against Shapiro,'' said
Lodish, who was asked by Israel's consul general in Miami, Rahamin
Timor, to handle the case. ``It is highly unusual to have someone
convicted of first-degree murder on evidence like that.''
   Pleas on Shapiro's behalf were sent by former Israeli Ambassador
to the United States Meir Rosenne, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kolek,
former B'nai B'rith international president William Wexler, and a
man who Shapiro says was a member of the Haganah, a Jewish defense
force formed secretly under British rule to counter Arab attacks.
It became the core of the Israeli army after the Jewish state was
founded in 1948.
   A Dade County circuit court jury convicted Shapiro in February
1976 of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
   Shapiro was convicted on the testimony of Larry D. Murren, who
pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 10
years in prison in exchange for his testimony, according to court
records. Murren was paroled after less than four years.
   ``The only real evidence and testimony against Shapiro was this
guy Murren who had admitted he lied initially when he told the FBI
his story,'' said Lodish.
   Another co-defendant, Michael Salvatore, was sentenced to death
for the deWitt murder in 1975, but that was commuted to life in
prison in 1981. He remains in jail.
   According to Shapiro's legal file, there was never any doubt
that Shapiro didn't participate directly in deWitt's pipe beating
death.
   Prosecutors claimed he hired Murren and Salvatore to do the
deed, but other evidence suggested the two men killed deWitt and
dumped his body at sea so they could steal back a stolen boat they
had sold to deWitt.
   Shapiro needed last month's clemency deal with Gov. Bob Martinez
and the independently elected state Cabinet, sitting as the Board
of Executive Clemency, because the United States and Israel have no
prisoner-exchange treaty, said Lodish.
   Conditions of the agreement require Shapiro to renounce his U.S.
citizenship and be relocated at the Kibbutz Ayelet-Hashachar in
northern Israel, where he will work at least eight hours a day, six
days a week.
   Herut Lapid, director of the United Kibbutz Movement and
director of prisons and rehabilitation, assured state officials in
a letter that a rehabilitation plan has been worked out for Shapiro.
   Florida has no way of ensuring Shapiro will finish his sentence
at the kibbutz once in Israel, but the promise of a job and dozens
of letters from well-respected sponsors make Martinez and the
Cabinet believe he will honor the agreement.
   ``We would hope that a nation such as Israel would live up to
whatever agreement ... that we use here to engage in clemency,''
said Martinez.

   The front-runner for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, died
in a plane crash as he was returning from a campaign stop,
authorities said Saturday.
   Waltermire, who was in a three-way race for the GOP nomination,
was flying back from Glasgow, in northeastern Montana, when the
twin-engine Cessna 310 went down Friday night in a field east of
East Helena, said his campaign manager, Chuck Brooke. The pilot
also was killed.
   Waltermire, of Helena, and his two GOP rivals had addressed a
Lincoln Day Dinner in Glasgow.
   Lewis and Clark County Coroner Mickey Nelson identified
Waltermire's body and that of the pilot, James A. Morris, 64, of
Dillon.
   The plane disappeared from radar at 11:23 p.m. as it approached
the Helena airport in light snow, said Nick Wantiez, a spokesman
for the Federal Aviation Administration in Seattle.
   The plane crashed a few minutes later in a field about four
miles from the airport runway and a quarter-mile north of U.S. 12,
said Nelson. Searchers found the plane about four hours later.
   The plane's wreckage was scattered along a path about 200 yards
long and 50 to 75 yards wide, Nelson said.
   ``It was believed it (the plane) originally had a pilot and two
passengers, but there's a possibility that one of the passengers
deplaned. We're just not sure,'' Wantiez said.
   Brooke said he knew of only two people aboard.
   Nelson described Morris as a very experienced pilot who was
familiar with the airport. But he said a ``severe springtime
storm'' could have contributed to the crash. ``It was snow and
sleet and fairly high winds,'' he said.
   Waltermire, 39, was elected secretary of state in 1980 and was
re-elected in 1984. Opposing him for the GOP gubernatorial
nomination was state Rep. Cal Winslow and former state Sen. Stan
Stephens.
   Waltermire began his political career in 1977 when he was
elected Missoula County commissioner. He ran unsuccessfully for the
western district congressional seat in 1978 before becoming
secretary of state two years later.
   He began laying the groundwork for his gubernatorial bid shortly
after being elected to a second term, putting in place an elaborate
funding operation to pay for what he said could be a $1 million
campaign.
   Waltermire had been at the center of controversy since assuming
the secretary of state's office. Ten months after his election, he
was embroiled in a dispute over his plan to create an ethics
commission.
   In 1985, he was criticized for using official trips at state
expense to arrange financing and support for future political
campaigns. He also came under fire for adding two political
advisers to his office staff and for using state phones to talk
with former campaign consultants and contributors.
   Last year, the courts overturned the election on two ballot
measures because of mistakes made by Waltermire's office in the
pre-election publication of the initiatives.

   Latin America's most violent
anti-U.S. demonstration of the year took place in Washington's
closest regional ally.
   As workers shoveled charred debris into bins Saturday and
engineers assessed damage to the fire-gutted U.S. consulate,
diplomats asked themselves what was behind the outbreak of
bitterness that left five people dead and caused millions of
dollars of damage.
   Honduras receives more than $300 million a year in U.S. aid,
hosts military maneuvers involving thousands of U.S. troops and has
been the staunchest supporter of Washington's Nicaragua policy,
which has involved funding the Contra rebels. For many years, the
insurgents had bases in Honduras.
   ``North Americans in Latin America are elephants in a crystal
shop,'' a South American ambassador in Central America told The
Associated Press Friday night, 24 hours after a mob of nearly 2,000
people attacked the U.S. Embassy complex in Tegucigalpa, capital of
Honduras.
   ``I don't have a bone of anti-Americanism in me,'' said the
envoy, who has served in several Latin American nations and spoke
on condition he not be further identified. ``But I can't understand
why, when they (the Americans) have all these problems in the
region _ Panama, Nicaragua _ they create another one i Honduras by
acting arrogantly.''
   He referred to the arrest Tuesday of Juan Ramon Matta, an
alleged drug lord long wanted in the United States.
   On Tuesday, Honduran officials took Matta from his Tegucigalpa
home in a pre-dawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to the
Dominican Republic without a passport.
   Dominican officials put Matta on a New York-bound flight and he
was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals, according to
U.S. law enforcement officials.
   Matta, held at the maximum-security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985
slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Honduran legislators angrily called the incident a
``kidnapping'' and the Foreign Ministry launched an investigation.
   The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of citizens.
   The move raised a storm of protest, much of it from groups
outside the small Honduran Marxist left, which blasts the United
States as a matter of course.
   The daily newspaper El Tiempo said in an editorial, ``In less
than a month, Honduras has been moved to indignation by two events,
which affected national dignity, integrity and sovereignty.
   ``In both cases, the offense has come from the United States ..
. The events show that the Honduran nation does not exist because
its authorities carry out the orders of another state and negate
their own institutions.''
   Besides the Matta case, the paper referred to the dispatch to
Honduras last month of 3,200 U.S. troops in response to a reported
incursion by Nicaraguan forces into Honduras. The government of
President Jose Azcona asked for the support, but Honduran
congressmen complained they were not consulted.
   Oswaldo Ramos Soto, rector of the National University in
Tegucigalpa, said of Matta's arrest, ``I think drug smugglers
should be captured and tried. But the extradition of Matta means
that our constitution has been flagrantly violated. The United
States has created with this incident a situation that will be
taken advantage of by communists in our country.''
   Azcona's government, as well as the U.S. Embassy, contend the
infuriated mob that set fire to the consulate is a tiny minority of
Marxist subversives. Police said four men and a woman died of
gunshot wounds during the riot.
   They said privately contracted Honduran guards, who take over
guard duty from U.S. Marines at night, fired into the mob with
shotguns.
   But an embassy spokesman, commenting on condition of anonymity,
denied that any personnel under contract to the mission opened fire.
   The spokesman rejected the suggestion that there was anti-U.S.
feeling in Honduras about to explode.
   ``That (Thursday night) was a small, misguided group that does
not represent the great majority of the Honduran people,'' he said.
   He said, however, that the ferocity of the reaction to Matta's
extradition was ``somewhat surprising.''

<HEAD>Mississippi Democrats Re-elect Party Chairman Over Governor's
Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi Democrats dealt a major blow
Saturday to the influence of newly inaugurated Gov. Ray Mabus,
retaining the nation's only black party chairman over the candidate
backed by the governor.
   The heated campaign between Ed Cole, an assistant to Sen. John
Stennis, D-Miss., and Billie Thompson, a white Tupelo
businesswoman, had been seen by some as the sign of a split in the
party. However, Cole, Thompson, and a spokesman for Mabus, who did
not attend, all said the party would remain unified.
   Cole, 43, who became chairman in November when his predecessor
resigned, received 56 of the 97 votes cast to win a full four-year
term. Thompson was the choice of 41 members of the 100-member
committee. Two members were absent and one who attended did not
vote.
   Thompson was a strong supporter of Mabus during his successful
campaign last year. Cole supported former Gov. Bill Waller in the
first primary, but switched to Mabus in the runoff.
   Thompson said she had offered Cole her congratulations and
``pledged him my total and complete support.
   ``I really think the party is going to get together. We don't
have any choice,'' she said.
   Democrats face major elections this year with 4th District Rep.
Wayne Dowdy, a Democrat, facing 5th District Republican Rep. Trent
Lott in the race to succeed Stennis, who is retiring after 41 years
in the Senate.
   Democrats, who generally dominate Mississippi politics, also
face strong Republican opposition in the races for Dowdy's and
Lott's seats.
   Cliff Treyens, Mabus' director of communications, said the
governor was called at the Governor's Mansion and informed of the
outcome of Saturday's vote and his reaction was to congratulate
Cole.
   ``We knew it would be a tough effort,'' Treyens said.
   Mabus had refused to comment publicly on the fight.
   Cole said he ``did not ask for a fight with the governor,'' but
wanted Mabus to ``accept that he belongs to our party and our party
does not belong to him.''
   Cole took over as party head when Steve Patterson of Jackson
resigned before announcing his unsusccessful bid for the party's
nomination in the 4th Congressional District.
   Patterson, who supported Cole's effort to win a full term and
said he was ``tickled to death'' with the outcome.
   While the fight over the chairmanship had been described as
split along racial lines, all the nominating and seconding speeches
were made by blacks.

   Mercedes Vaca winces at the thought
that imprisoned Contra rebels and former national guardsmen, maybe
men who killed her son, might go free under a government amnesty.
   Sylvia Aleman says her two brothers were falsely accused of
being anti-government guerrillas, and she fumes at the idea that
they remain behind bars.
   In the hearts of these two women, both prominent members of
mothers' movements with opposing views, there can be no truce, no
lasting peace.
   Sandinista government troops and Contra rebels have observed a
60-day cease-fire since April 1. During that time, they have tried
to negotiate a permanent truce in the 6{-year-old civil war that
has killed or injured an estimated 60,000 people.
   As part of the cease-fire, the Sandinistas have pledged
gradually to free 3,300 political prisoners and allow exiles to
return to Nicaragua.
   Mrs. Vaca, 69, a staunch government supporter and member of the
government-supported Mothers of Heroes and Martyrs, bristles at
talk of the release.
   ``We are afraid,'' she said last week. ``We don't have any trust
in the Contras. They killed. They are savage animals.
   ``Do you know how many children died in their mothers' arms? How
can we forgive that?'' she asked, sitting in a rocking chair at her
home in a middle-class Managua neighborhood.
   ``For me, there will always be pain,'' she said. ``I lost my
son.''
   Jacinto Vaca is a hero to many Nicaraguans. They count him among
martyrs who died to bring the Sandinistas to power in a
revolutionary war that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   Vaca began fighting when he was 13 years old. When he was 24, he
was killed in a northern village by members of Somoza's National
Guard, which the rightist, pro-American leader had used to maintain
power.
   ``I felt he was too young to be a revolutionary,'' said Mrs.
Vaca, a petite, elegant woman with white hair. ``But it was a time
when it was a crime just to be young.''
   Vaca was arrested three times, held incommunicado, tortured and
beaten, but he stayed loyal to the revolution, his mother said.
   ``After the last time he was taken prisoner, he said he'd rather
die than go back to jail,'' she said. ``They (the National Guard)
were inhuman. I can't tell you all the horrors, all the blood, what
criminals they are.''
   The Contra rebels grew from a group of national guardsmen that
fled to Honduras and the northern mountains after Somoza was
overthrown. By late 1981, trained and supplied by the CIA, they
began to mount attacks to oust the Sandinista government.
   Over the years, many poor peasants joined their ranks.
   Mrs. Aleman, a member of the opposition Jan. 22 Movement, said
last week two of her younger brothers were hauled off to jail four
years ago and summarily charged by a revolutionary court. The group
is named after the day it was founded in 1987.
   ``About 10 military jeeps surrounded the house,'' said Mrs.
Aleman, 36, a leader of an anti-government group of mothers and
other relatives of political prisoners.
   ``It was terrible. They were state security agents, and they
searched the house, beat up my nephew and planted weapons,'' she
said.
   They took away Juan Pablo Aleman, 32, and sentenced him to 18
years in prison. Later that day, police picked up her other
brother, Elias Aleman, 34, on a street in Managua, she said.
   ``We didn't know where Elias was; they wouldn't say,'' said Mrs.
Aleman, waiting to take statements from relatives of other
political prisoners at an office of the Democratic Coordinate, an
anti-government umbrella group.
   ``We didn't know anything for two months. He has been tortured
and beaten,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aleman says she detests and mistrusts the Sandinistas, who
sentenced Elias to 30 years in jail. She said many of the 4,000
mothers who belong to her group tell similar horror stories of
clandestine jails and torture.
   ``The Sandinistas are, as they always have been, deceiving,
lying to the people,'' the dark-haired woman with coffee-colored
complexion said. ``They will never live up to the cease-fire
agreement on their own.''
   Mrs. Aleman said she had prayed her brothers would be among the
first 100 prisoners freed March 27.
   ``I didn't get emotional when I saw they weren't included. Maybe
I'm tired. We have suffered so much, only God can help us,'' she
said, lowering her eyes.
   Mrs. Vaca says she has sympathy for people like Mrs. Aleman; for
their children, she feels something else: ``We feel sorry for them
because they have children who are murderers.''

   The courtroom battle for the child once
known as Baby M ended last week when the woman who bore the child
under a surrogate contract won greatly expanded visitation rights.
   Now the dispute over 2-year-old Melissa Stern's future moves out
of the public eye and into the privacy of the counselor's office.
   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, the child's biological mother, and
William and Elizabeth Stern, who have custody of the girl, have
been ordered to undergo counseling to come to terms with their new
and complicated relationship.
   The Sterns and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould disagree over how how easy
it will be to work out their problems.
   The Sterns still distrust Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and feel she
doesn't have the child's best interest in mind, said Frank Donahue,
a lawyer for the Tenafly couple.
   ``I think to make this work, Mary Beth is going to have to
recognize that although she's the mother, Bill and Betsy are the
ones who are going to shape and form this child and they will be
the role models,'' Donahue said.
   But Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Joel Siegal, said the new
arrangement will ``proceed much more quickly than the parties
themselves realize.''
   ``They're all nice people; they're intelligent. They all love
Melissa. They recognize that it's counterproductive not to
cooperate,'' he said.
   Wednesday's ruling by Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween was
the final legal word in a dispute that began moments after
Melissa's birth on March 31, 1986, and went on to capture worldwide
attention.
   Both sides enter into their new relationship with victories and
losses in the courts.
   The Sterns _ he a biochemist, she a pediatrician _ won custody
of Melissa in a Feb. 3 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that upheld
the custody portion of a March 31, 1987, lower-court decision. The
Supreme Court then returned the case to Superior Court to resolve
the visitation issue.
   The Sterns, both 42, had hired Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, to bear
them a child for $10,000 by being artificially inseminated with
Stern's sperm.
   When the child was born, however, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould changed
her mind about the arrangement and refused to give up the baby. No
money ever changed hands.
   Under Sween's visitation ruling, the Sterns will be in charge of
most of the child's upbringing, including such matters as education
and religion. In effect, Stern will be the father, Mrs. Stern the
stepmother.
   But the Sterns lost their fight to cut Mrs. Whitehead-Gould off
completely from the child. Sween granted the East Brunswick
housewife immediate, unsupervised visitation for six hours one day
a week.
   The judge ruled the visitation is to be expanded to include an
extra day every other week, overnight, some holidays and a two-week
vacation in the summer of 1989.
   The visitation and the counseling are to begin immediately, but
the exact dates were put under seal by the judge.
   Lori Andrews, a researcher with the American Bar Foundation who
has followed the case closely, said the key to protecting the child
is cooperation among the adults.
   ``If the parties can see it as a final action and cooperate,
there's less of a chance of harm. If they're both trying to enlarge
their rights constantly, the child will become more of an object,''
Ms. Andrews said.

<HEAD>Georgia Bans Execution Of Retarded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DICK PETTYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia will prohibit the execution of people
found ``guilty but mentally retarded'' when a newly signed bill
prompted by a 1986 execution takes effect this summer
   The measure passed the 1988 General Assembly despite initial
opposition to early drafts from prosecutors. Gov. Joe Frank Harris'
signature last week puts it on the law books July 1.
   The law allows juries _ or judges if a jury trial is waived _ to
return a new verdict of ``guilty but mentally retarded'' and
stipulates that individuals so convicted could be sentenced to life
but cannot be executed.
   Georgia law previously allowed verdicts of not guilty by reason
of insanity and guilty but mentally ill, but had no separate
provision for the mentally retarded.
   Before being allowed to enter a plea of guilty but mentally
retarded, an individual would be required to undergo a
psychological examination and satisfy the judge that there was a
factual basis for him to enter the plea.
   Atlanta lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith said Georgia may be the
first state to take such a step. In his research in defending
indigent prisoners, including one who is mentally retarded, he
found no other state with such a law, he said.
   Stafford-Smith also said the measure is ``probably the first
validly anti-death penalty law in the history of the state of
Georgia.'' Laughlin McDonald, southern regional director of the
American Civil Liberties Union, described the measure as
``progressive legislation.''
   Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers, who opposed an earlier
version of the legislation, said he believes the final product ``is
progressive and a step forward in explicitly recognizing we are not
going to impose the death penalty on persons who are mentally
retarded.''
   The new law was prompted in part by widespread criticism of the
execution of Jerome Bowden.
   Bowden, whose attorneys contended he should not be executed
because of mental retardation, was sentenced to death for a 1976
murder.
   When his appeals were exhausted and the execution date drew
near, the state Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a one-week
stay to allow time for a new IQ test.
   Despite the finding that Bowden's IQ was 65 _ 100 is considered
average _ the board concluded that Bowden knew right from wrong and
voted to allow the execution to be carried out. He was executed
June 24, 1986.
   More recently, the Georgia Supreme Court has ordered new murder
trials for two other men whose attorneys contend they are mentally
retarded.
   In one case, the Supreme Court said the trial judge should have
held a hearing to determine whether the defendant was competent to
stand trial. In the other, the Supreme Court said the trial judge
erred in instructing the jury about provisions of the guilty but
mentally ill statute.
   In neither case, however, did the court rule specifically on the
execution of mentally retarded people.
   Rep. Charles Thomas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
said court decisions suggested the need for legislation.
   ``In the opinion on the Jerome Bowden case, the Supreme Court
more or less said this is something the General Assembly needs to
look at, and there have been several other cases where the
defendants were borderline or clearly retarded, but there was no
provision in the law to deal with them other than as if they were
competent adults,'' Thomas said.
   Fulton County District Attorney Lewis Slaton said his concern
during the debate over the law was not with banning the execution
of mentally retarded people.
   ``What we've always been concerned about ... is that we are
leery of changing the law because it means that every person on
death row can now raise another ground,'' he said.

<HEAD>Plaintiffs End Case in Tobacco Trial, Cigarette Makers Take Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case against three cigarette companies
accused of liability in the lung-cancer death of Rose Cipollone
began with a review of 60 years of research into the health effects
of smoking.
   It ended this week with some observers in the federal courtroom
weeping as Mrs. Cipollone's husband, Antonio, gave a tearful
account of his wife's death.
   In between, the jury heard expert witnesses discuss cancer, Mrs.
Cipollone's 40-year smoking addiction, her medical condition, and
how cigarettes are advertised and marketed. Perhaps most damaging
to the industry was the blitz of secret internal documents obtained
over years of court-ordered pre-trial discovery by Cipollone's
lawyers.
   The documents and testimony by researchers provided the most
sensational grist for tobacco opponents, who seized on the
information as a major aid in future lawsuits.
   The evidence included memorandums that spoke of the ``hurdle''
of the smoking and health issue, of the risk that selling a safer
cigarette would bring more liability lawsuits, and of the public
relations ``war'' against health charges.
   The trial began Feb. 1. Except for testimony in early March by
an addiction expert who described Mrs. Cipollone's smoking habits,
it was only toward the end of the plaintiffs' case that Mrs.
Cipollone came to life for the jury.
   In the past few weeks her daughter took the stand and
depositions from Mrs. Cipollone's sisters were read to the jury.
Jurors also heard Mrs. Cipollone's own words in a deposition made
before her death at age 58 in 1984.
   On Wednesday, Cipollone testified.
   He is seeking damages from the defendants _ Lorillard Inc.,
Philip Morris Co. and Liggett Group Inc. _ charging that they
failed to do enough research on cigarettes and health, to tell the
public what they did know, and to put a safer product on the market.
   The industry, which has never lost such a case, is focusing on
the individual as the key to its defense, which began Thursday.
   The companies argue that it was Mrs. Cipollone's choice to smoke
as an intelligent, independent and strong-willed woman who knew the
risks of smoking, at least as articulated by critics. The industry
does not acknowledge that cigarettes are a proven cause of cancer.
   The companies began presenting their case with an economic
historian who testified about the information Mrs. Cipollone would
have had available to her _ namely hundreds of articles on the
risks of smoking that appeared in newspapers she read.
   Morris attorney Peter Bleakley said Friday the defendants' case
should last three to four weeks.
   This week, they expect to call Mrs. Cipollone's brother to the
stand to testify about what she knew and heard about smoking and
health.
   Then come more excerpts of Mrs. Cipollone's testimony and
experts on consumer behavior, marketing, cancer and addiction to
counter evidence by the plaintiff's experts.
   Both sides agree on a fundamental decision the jury has to make.
   Did Mrs. Cipollone believe smoking was legitimately dangerous,
and if she didn't, was it the industry's fault?
   ``It's going to come down to how much personal responsibility
you put on her, and how much you put on the defendants,'' said
Cipollone attorney Cynthia A. Walters.

<HEAD>Dukakis Calls For National Law On Factory Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALIFORNIA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, on a brief foray into an
economically depressed coal and steel area, called Saturday for
enactment of a national law on plant closings and said, ``I know
what it's like to work with communities like this one.''
   Campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, the
Massachusetts governor appeared at a mine workers union parade in
southwestern Pennsylvania before flying to upstate New York.
   The current delegate leader in the three-candidate race, Dukakis
hopes victories in upcoming primaries in New York, Pennsylvania and
Ohio will effectively clinch his claim to the nomination.
   Dukakis and rivals Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. are
concentrating on New York, which holds its primary on April 19.
Pennsylvania votes a week later, and Ohio the the week after that.
   Asked to differentiate himself from Jackson, Dukakis replied,
``I'm not just a talker, I'm a doer. I know what it's like to work
with communities like this one. I know what it takes to bring them
back.''
   Dukakis was asked whether that meant as criticism of Jackson,
whose ability as a speaker far outshines that of his rivals.
   ``No, it's a statement of fact about the strengths I bring to
this campaign,'' he replied.
   From Pennsylvania, Dukakis flew to Rochester, N.Y., and toured a
high-tech plant.
   His final stop of the day was a community forum at a steel
workers union hall in Dunkirk, N.Y., outside of Buffalo.
   People who lined the main street of California to watch the
parade and hear Dukakis told of a community that has lost thousands
of jobs in the past 10 years.
   A nearby steel plant once employed 10,000 and now has a skeletal
force of 400. Coal mines that employed thousands more have shut
down or installed machinery that drastically cut the need for
miners.
   ``This is the most depressed area in the country,'' said one
retired miner. ``It's going down, down, down.''
   ``Twenty-six-year-old boys, as healthy as can be and they can't
get jobs,'' interjected another.
   A woman said Franklin D. Roosevelt was the last great president.
   ``There was a complete turnaround,'' she said. ``We had
confidence.''
   As for the current candidates, ``I don't see an outstanding
leader in none of them.''
   People who voiced support for Dukakis said it was because they
felt he would be pro-union.
   ``He's strictly for labor, that's what they're after, labor,''
said Edward Mathews, a retired member of the United Mine Workers of
America.
   ``I know what you've been going through here in the Mon
(Monongahela) Valley,'' said Dukakis. ``Years and years of lost
jobs.''
   He said the election was ``about people, about jobs'' and the
next president ``must be someone who knows how to build a strong
economy and has done it.''
   He said Massachusetts has ``one of the most comprehensive plant
closing laws in the nation'' that not only required companies to
give long advance notice of plans to shut down a plant but also to
require them to provide extended health care benefits to displaced
workers.
   He said he would press for enactment of similar legislation on a
national basis if elected president.
   At a news conference after his speech, Dukakis said that Japan
requires companies to give three years' notice before closing a
plant.
   ``I don't think the American people ought to tolerate what's
been permitted to happen to people and families and communities
like this one,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The governing National Party,
faced with dwindling support among right-wing whites, has launched
an aggressive political and military offensive aimed at its
numerous foreign and domestic opponents.
   In recent weeks, President P.W. Botha's government has
effectively banned 18 opposition groups, arrested prominent
clergymen, threatened and raided neighboring countries in pursuit
of alleged terrorists, and brazenly challenged the United Nations
to impose sanctions.
   The hardline actions have provided fresh ammunition to
anti-apartheid activists abroad and suggest the government has
chosen to ignore virtually all its critics except the conservative
whites who contend Botha is capitulating to the nation's 26 million
black majority.
   Under apartheid, blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.
   So far, the Nationalists' tough-guy posture has not worked.
White voters opted for the staunchly pro-apartheid Conservative
Party in three special parliamentary elections in March, and the
Conservatives appear headed for additional gains in nationwide
municipal elections in October.
   The Nationalists now hold 133 seats in the 178-member dominant
white chamber of Parliament. Conservatives hold 23, the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party holds 17 and other parties
hold five.
   The setbacks led two pro-government newspapers to question the
political prospects of the National Party and its vaguely defined
reform proposals.
   ``There can be no survival without reform,'' said The Citizen.
``But without providing the whites with the security they crave,
the National Party will have a tough time surviving.''
   ``Numerous Nationalists feel the road ahead should be more
clearly spelled out,'' said Beeld, an Afrikaans-language daily.
``We get the impression that (the ordinary man) now feels the NP
has risen so high above him that it has completely lost contact.''
   The National Party says it seeks gradual race reform, with
blacks gaining a voice in national politics but with whites
maintaining ultimate control. The Conservatives oppose all
concessions to blacks and seek to rescind reforms implemented in
recent years.
   Government opponents, including blacks, white liberals and
foreign critics, say the reforms are totally inadequate. But their
voices have been dismissed as irrelevant during the increasingly
bitter debate between the Nationalists and the Conservatives.
   Ironically, the government's crackdown began at a time when
black unrest was at its lowest level in years, the foreign
sanctions campaign was on the wane and domestic opposition groups
had been crippled by detentions and legal restrictions.
   When the government released Govan Mbeki, leader of the African
National Congress guerrilla group, last November, there was
widespread speculation of additional releases and increased
political reform.
   Mbeki's release did not spawn any upsurge in demonstrations or
violence, but it did produce a backlash among conservative whites
who felt Botha was caving in to black militants.
   Since that time, the government has sought to make clear that it
will protect the privileged position of the white minority.
   The latest crackdown began on Feb. 24, when the government
banned 18 leading anti-apartheid organizations from participating
in politics and placed individual restrictions on more than a dozen
activists.
   The army raided a house in Gaborone, Botswana, on March 28,
killing four people they said were guerrillas of the African
National Congress.
   Six other congress officials have been killed in foreign
countries this year. The most recent was Dulcie September, the
group's representative to France, killed in Paris on March 29.
South Africa has denied responsibility in the deaths, but
repeatedly has said it will enter other countries in pursuit of ANC
members.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, and 24 other clerics were arrested March 29 during a
peaceful demonstration near Parliament in Cape Town. Botha has on
several occasions warned the clergy to avoid political
confrontation.
   The government on March 21 shut down the New Nation newspaper
for 12 weeks, saying it ``fanned revolution.'' Several more
publications appear likely to be closed.
   South Africa's ambassador to the United Nations, Les Manley,
recently told the Security Council to ``do your damndest'' and
impose sanctions. A subsequent sanctions measured died because of
vetoes from Britain and the United States.
   Political observers say the recent string of actions indicates
the National Party now perceives the Conservatives as a genuine
threat to the 40 years of unbroken rule of the Nationalists.
   The government regularly attacks the Conservatives and their
close ally, the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a paramilitary,
white-supremacist organization that uses Nazi-style symbols.
   Botha recently made public a letter he sent to movement leader
Eugene TerreBlanche, who advocates creation of a whites-only
Afrikaner state.
   ``You are building emotions around nebulous dreams which have
little relationships to the practical circumstances and demands of
South Africa,'' Botha wrote.
   ``Throughout the world there is enough undeserved hatred toward
the Afrikaner, so we cannot afford in this country that Afrikaners,
by their own actions, are made the subject of hatred and
ridicule,'' Botha added.
   Botha and his party, having promoted gradual change for the past
several years, now face the prospect of losing their traditional
Afrikaner base if they continue to call for apartheid reforms.
   ``It would be foolish (for the Nationalists) to go back on
reforms,'' said Willem Kleynhans, a prominent political scientist.
``But if they introduce new reforms they will lose support. They
are in a tight spot.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milos Jakes, leader of the
Communist Party, urged its 1.7 million members Saturday to support
reforms and win more popular support for the party.
   Earlier Saturday, the party elevated two officials to the ruling
Politburo and three others to senior party posts as it wrapped up
its two-day Central Committee session. Ten people were named
Central Committee members.
   Jakes, who took over the party leadership last December, said
one aim of the personnel changes was ``to elevate younger comrades
and thus create conditions for further successful fulfillment of
party tasks.''
   In a closing speech, Jakes said he was sure Communist leaders
could ``get the party going'' to overcome shortcomings in
Czechoslovakia's economy and social life. The theme was echoed in
an 11-page resolution adopted by the Central Committee.
   Despite a relatively high membership _ 1.7 million people in a
population of 15.5 million _ the Communist Party has had difficulty
mobilizing popular support since a Warsaw Pact invasion crushed the
party-led reforms of Alexander Dubcek in 1968.
   In the 1970s, Czechoslovakia enjoyed a relatively high standard
of living. But the economy is now slowing down with growth around 2
percent a year and the Communists admitted last year reform is
needed.
   But the party has appeared divided over how much reform to allow
and has moved slowly to enact change.
   The Central Committee's resolution limits the party leader to
two five-year terms, restricts regional officials to three
consecutive terms and reduces the number of jobs one person can
hold.
   The resolution, published by the state news agency CTK, did not
mention a vague proposal made by Jakes in a speech Friday to
separate the functions of party and state organs, leaving
day-to-day administration to the latter.
   Jakes said Saturday that the Central Committee meeting paid
great attention to how Communists should maintain their traditional
leading role in Czechoslovak society.
   ``The point is not to substitute for economic and state organs,
national committees, social organizations, but to influence their
activity through Communists working there,'' Jakes said.
   The resolution accused Communists of being too bureaucratic and
said they failed to set an example for the rest of society.
   It stopped short, however, of accepting party responsibility for
the flagging economy and what it termed ``bitter'' social problems.
   Jakes said the party would ``draw efficient conclusions,
especially in higher party bodies'' about some members' passivity
toward restructuring, as the reforms are known. The term is also
used for Mikhail Gorbachev's introduction of free-market elements
into the Soviet economy.
   CTK said the party leadership changes were agreed by secret
ballot. However, several of them had been widely rumored in Prague
before the plenum.
   Jan Fojtik, 60, an expert in Communist ideology, and Slovak
Communist Ignac Janak, 57, were promoted to the ruling Politburo
and Prague party boss Antonin Kapek was dropped.
   Kapek, 65, had been on the Politburo since 1970 and has headed
the Prague party since 1969. He was considered a hardliner in the
late 1960s but lately has tried to overtake others in promoting
economic reform. He is said to have irked Jakes by pushing too hard
for economic changes.
   Miroslav Zavadil, 56, head of the state-run trade unions, was
named a candidate Politburo member and Jozef Lenart, 60, the Slovak
party leader, comes to Prague to take over Jakes' old job as head
of a party commission on economic reform.
   Frantisek Hanus, 45, was elected a member of the secretariat of
the Central Committee.
   Most of the 10 new members elected to the Central Committee are
between 30 and 50 years of age.
   In his speech, Jakes said there would also be government changes
but gave no details.
   According to informed sources, a number of ministries are to be
amalgamated and between 30,000 and 50,000 bureaucrats will lose
their jobs in a plan to be announced later this month.

<HEAD>Governor's Removal May Reverberate For Years In Arizona Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether former Gov. Evan Mecham is in or
out of politics, his 15-month tenure as governor and sudden removal
are likely to have strong reverberations in Arizona politics for
years, lawmakers say.
   Some of the senators who voted at his impeachment trial to
remove the first-term Republican from office last week hope Mecham
will fade from the political scene and take the recent
rough-and-tumble out of Arizona politics.
   Mecham himself isn't yet tipping his hand. He says he wants to
run for re-election in the May 17 recall vote that was aimed at
removing him, if the election is still held and if he is allowed to
be on the ballot. Arizona courts are expected to decide those
issues.
   The former auto dealer also says he is writing a book and would
like to hit the lecture circuit to take his conservative political
message nationwide.
   Also facing him is a May 19 criminal trial, postponed Friday
from April 21, on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The Senate convicted him Monday of trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat and of misusing $80,000
from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership. However, senators failed to muster the two-thirds vote
to bar him from holding any future public office.
   ``I believe that the political career of Evan Mecham is done
with. I do not believe he will ever hold elective office again, and
I do not believe that he will be a major factor in politics in this
state again,'' said Sen. Greg Lunn, who voted to convict the
governor on both counts.
   But in the days after his ouster Mecham packed them in at public
appearances, and he was introduced as ``the people's governor'' at
one meeting in a conservative GOP stronghold in suburban Mesa.
   He said he plans to keep making public appearances but added it
would be premature to consider running for any public office other
than governor.
   ``I think he ought to run for the state Senate,'' joked Minority
Leader Alan Stephens, who voted to convict the governor. ``I'd like
to have an office next to him.''
   State GOP Chairman Burton Kruglick suggested Mecham might be
better off for now if he were to concentrate on his family and
finances since he is selling his Mecham Pontiac dealership to avert
financial ruin.
   Sen. Pat Wright, a Republican and staunch Mecham backer, said
the former governor stimulated new interest in politics from
conservative Arizonans who now are attending GOP district meetings
in droves.
   The Democrats hope this new conservative interest will
ultimately give their party some GOP seats and possibly the Senate
majority in the fall elections. At present, Republicans outnumber
Democrats 19-11.
   That hope is based on the idea that some GOP lawmakers who
opposed the governor face likely primary challenges in September by
strong Mecham backers. If the incumbents lose, some believe, those
seats could be vulnerable to Democrats in the general election.
   Some major questions must be settled first. The Arizona Supreme
Court is to hear arguments Tuesday on a lawsuit aimed at canceling
the May 17 recall election on grounds its target _ Mecham _ already
has been removed from office.
   If the court rules the recall is to be held, and if Mecham
decides he wants to run, a court probably will be asked to
determine if he is still entitled to be on the ballot.
   But if Mecham is convicted in criminal court, he would lose his
right to run for office for the duration of any prison term or
probation.
   At least some ballots were being printed without Mecham's name.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin said recently it was his opinion
that since Mecham has been removed from the governorship, and since
Mecham didn't file a nominating petition as other candidates were
required to do, his name should not be on the ballot.

<HEAD>OPEC ministers agree to special meetings on declining oil prices.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five OPEC oil ministers agreed Saturday
to call two special meetings later this month to consider ways of
halting the decline in oil prices, according to the cartel's
Nigerian president.
   The ministers, at the end of a full day of closed-door meetings,
made no recommendations for immediate OPEC action to combat the
slipping prices, said Nigeria's Rilwanu Lukman, who was chairman of
the session.
   He said he and the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Algeria,
Venezuela and Indonesia would invite at least seven non-OPEC oil
producing nations to meet with them in Vienna on April 23 to
discuss ways of cooperating to stabilize oil prices.
   Lukman declined to identify the non-OPEC countries, but industry
sources said they would be Mexico, Egypt, Oman, Angola, Brunei,
Malaysia and Colombia.
   When asked, Lukman said he would not rule out inviting
representatives also from the Soviet Union and Norway. The Soviets
are the world's largest oil producers.
   Oil ministers of all 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will then meet in Vienna on April 25, Lukman
said. He suggested that the non-OPEC representatives might be asked
to attend that session as official observers.
   OPEC had not previously planned to hold any meetings until its
regularly scheduled summer conference June 8.
   Lukman said the five ministers had decided that special meetings
were needed to ``look into the situation generally in the market''
and to consider ways of cooperating with non-OPEC countries.
   OPEC oil ministers held two meetings with representatives of
Mexico, Angola, Egypt, Malaysia, Oman and Brunei in the spring of
1986, but the cartel was unsuccessful in persuading those countries
to reduce their production.
   This time the situation is different, according to Lukman.
   ``Non-OPEC (countries) have, on their own, realized the need to
cooperate'' among themselves and with OPEC, Lukman told reporters
after the meeting.
   OPEC often has declared in recent years that it alone cannot be
expected to bear the burden of cutting production in order to
stablize oil prices.
   OPEC controls only about 35 percent of the total world oil
supply, down from more than 60 percent in the late 1970s.
   Lukman said the separate April 25 meeting of all 13 OPEC members
was called because of the severity of the recent price decline.
   ``The price is not what we expected it to be'' after having
decided last December to maintain strict oil production limits, he
said.
   Oil prices in the open market are at least $3 below OPEC's
official target level of $18 a barrel.
   Lukman said Saturday's meeting had made no recommendation about
whether OPEC should reduce its production, either unilaterally or
jointly with non-OPEC producers, as a way of boosting prices.
   He said increased production by non-OPEC producers this year was
partly responsible for the oil price slump.
   Although Iran was not invited to Saturday's meeting, its deputy
oil minister, Kazempour Ardebili, flew to Vienna and met separately
with members of the group.
   He said later in an interview in his hotel room that Iran had
proposed that OPEC cut its production by at least 5 percent
immediately. He said this should be done with or without parallel
action by non-OPEC oil-producing countries.
   Ardebili accused some OPEC members, which he did not name, of
sabotaging Iranian initiatives to boost prices by cutting output.
His comments appeared to be directed at Saudi Arabia, an opponent
of further cuts in OPEC's share of the world oil market.
   Persian Iran has been at war with Arab Iraq since September
1980, and Iran often accuses other Arab countries of supporting
Iraq directly or indirectly in the conflict. Both Iran and Iraq
count on revenues from oil exports to help finance their war
efforts.

<HEAD>College Trustees Block Ban On CIA Recruiters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colby College trustees voted Saturday
to keep the school open ``to all groups'' for recruiting, including
the CIA, ending a debate that put liberal professors at odds with
more conservative students.
   The trustees, voting unanimously, also approved guidelines that
would allow the college to require employers seeking to recruit to
``discuss publicly on campus (their) policies and practices.''
   Last November the faculty passed a motion by a 5-2 margin
opposing campus recruitment by the CIA ``as a result of its illegal
incursions into Nicaragua, its role in illegal arms sales, its
illegal investigations into the lives of private citizens ... until
it obeys the U.S. Constitution.''
   In response, the Student Association passed a motion in favor of
allowing CIA recruitment. Some opponents of the ban argued that the
real issue was student rights.
   The private college has an enrollment of 1,700.
   Board chairman H. Ridgely Bullock and Colby president William R.
Cotter issued a statement Saturday saying that the trustees had
weighed ``the very real concerns'' of CIA critics against ``Colby's
historic commitment to free speech and freedom of choice for its
students.''
   ``We have concluded that free speech and freedom of choice must
prevail,'' they said, characterizing the vote as one in favor of
``greater access and discussion, not less.''
   The Student Association's president, John McNinch, a senior from
Lenox, Mass., said he had opposed a recruiting ban and was pleased
by the trustees' vote, but added that he also supported the proviso
requiring an open dialogue with recruiters.
   A panel representing students, faculty members, administrators
and trustees is to be established to implement the guidelines at
the school.

<HEAD>U.S. Businesses Grapple With New Sanctions Against Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businessmen complained
Saturday that new U.S. sanctions against the government controlled
by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega have thrown them into confusion.
   ``Don't ask me'' how the restrictions will affect U.S. firms,
said one manager, speaking on condition of anonymity at a large
American company Saturday. ``I'm sure it'll take our legal
department back home some time to figure it out.''
   The new restraints, announced Friday by President Reagan, forbid
payments to the Noriega regime by U.S. citizens and organizations
either in the United States or Panama. The executive order also
freezes all assets of the Panamanian government in the United
States.
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy, said tax
payments should be transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank in New
York into an account set up for deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle, who was forced from office by Noriega in February after
trying to fire the general.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle, who has been in
hiding, as Panama's legal president.
   Noriega, Panama's military chief, has been indicted in the
United States on federal drug trafficking charges.
   With the United States and domestic opponents trying to oust
Noriega, Panama has been thrust into an economic and social crisis.
Noriega forced banks to close March 4, and the government has been
unable to pay its estimated 130,000 employees and 15,000 troops for
more than a month.
   A manager of a U.S. franchise in Panama suggested Saturday the
president's executive order could give Noriega an excuse to shut
down U.S. companies doing business in Panama.
   ``The U.S. has very little to say in this situation as far as
preventing U.S. companies from deciding whether or not to pay taxes
in Panama. If you don't pay, your right to operate here can be
taken away,'' he said.
   Also looking for answers was Alfredo Arango, spokesman for Petro
Terminales, S.A., which operates a pipeline carrying Alaskan crude
oil across Panama for shipment to Gulf and East Coast markets in
the United States.
   Arango said 60 percent of the company's stock is owned by two
American companies, Northville Industries Corp. and Chicago Bridge
and Iron International, with the rest held by the Panamanian
government.
   He said the pipeline is the biggest single customer of the
state-run electric company, paying it $8.4 million a year.
   The U.S. Commerce Department estimated American investment in
Panama at more than $4.3 billion at the end of 1986, the last year
for which figures are available. It said most was concentrated in
petroleum refining, agriculture, fishing, and food processing.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Panama City lists 190 members,
including representatives of such giant American firms as
Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Borden, General Mills, IBM, Kodak,
Colgate Palmolive and Texaco. Many members are small-business men
who own franchises licensed by firms such as McDonalds, Burger King
and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   Most U.S. and other foreign firms doing business in Panama are
lightly taxed, one reason that many have made the country their
branch headquarters for Central and Latin American operations.
   Still, when American firms paid their quarterly social security
and business license taxes to the government at the end of March,
the U.S. Embassy estimated the total at about $5.6 million. That
did not include taxes paid on light, gas, telephone and other
utility bills.
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy, said
Saturday the Treasury Department in Washington probably would
exempt from the sanctions relatively small tax payments for such
things as utilities and airport landing fees.
   The new sanctions fall under a 1977 law designed to protect
national security. The seldom-used emergency act was last invoked
to try to oust Libyan leader Moammar Khaddafy and the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. Both remain in power.

<HEAD>Government To Issue Drug Testing Guidelines on Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will issue detailed guidelines
outlining the technical requirements for testing federal workers
for illegal drug use, an official said Saturday.
   The guidelines, to be published Monday in the Federal Register,
set forth ``conditions under which (urine) specimens would be taken
and ... the standards labs would have to meet,'' said Campbell
Gardett, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   The rules do not cover which employees will be tested or under
what circumstances, Gardett said, confirming a report in The
Washington Post. Such matters will be delineated in plans by
individual departments and agencies, he said.
   Currently, only the Defense Department and the Transportation
Department test employees in sensitive positions.
   Public employee unions have been resisting the tests, contending
they violate workers' constitutional rights, and have filed suit to
block them.
   The publication of the technical requirements for testing is the
first of three steps necessary before widespread testing of
civilian government workers begins.
   The second step, an HHS review of testing plans from departments
and agencies, should be completed within several months, he said.
   The third step, which he said should follow soon after that, is
a report to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget
estimating the cost of the program, which the Post said is
preliminarily estimated at about $7 million.
   The technical guidelines were proposed nearly 14 months ago in
response to a September 1986 executive order issued as part of
President Reagan's campaign for a drug-free workplace.
   They are to guard against cheating by requiring that toilet
water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of the urine sample and that
the temperature of the samples be taken to prevent substitution by
another sample smuggled into the toilet stall.
   According to the newspaper, the guidelines require testing for
cocaine and marijuana and permit testing for PCP, opiates and
amphetamines.

<HEAD>Cold Front Spreads Snow & Rain Across Central Part Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front sliding across the central part of the nation
Saturday spread snow across Wyoming and rain across the Plains into
Texas.
   Heavy snow was reported during the morning at South Pass, south
of Lander, Wyo., with more than 8 inches falling in about five
hours. An inch of snow was on the ground at Rawlins, while most of
central and southern Wyoming had occasional light snow but with no
significant accumulation.
   Light snow also was reported in the foothills of Colorado
including the Denver area, and in parts of Minnesota, with one inch
at Alexandria.
   Light rain fell across western Iowa, southeastern Nebraska, much
of eastern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. Rain was mixed with snow
in northeastern Kansas at Fort Riley.
   Showers were scattered across southern and western Texas, and
afternoon temperatures stayed around 60 degrees as far south as
south-central Texas.
   At the northern end of the cold front, Kalispell, Mont., had a
record low of 18 degrees, and Missoula, Mont., tied its record low
of 19.
   East of the cold front, highs in the 70s were reported in the
Mississippi Valley as far north as Wisconsin.
   But cold air still covered the mid-Atlantic states with readings
mostly in the 50s from eastern North Carolina to New Jersey, and it
was chillier still in the Appalachians from New York to West
Virginia. Binghamton, N.Y., had a 2 p.m. reading of just 34 degrees.
   A frost advisory was posted for the mountains, foothills and
eastern Piedmont region of South Carolina. And farther to the
south, Key West, Fla., had a record low of 59 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., and Rawlins, Wyo., to
90 at Ontario, Calif. The early-morning low for the day was zero at
West Yellowstone, Mont., and Yellowstone National Park.
   For Sunday, rain was forecast from Texas across eastern Kansas
and Missouri to the upper Mississippi Valley, with a few
thunderstorms in southeastern Texas and the middle Mississippi
Valley. Scattered drizzle or snow flurries were forecast across New
Hampshire and Maine. Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms
were forecast for southern Florida.
   Highs only in the 30s were predicted in northern Maine and
northern Minnesota; in the 40s or 50s from the Rockies and Plains
across the northern half of the Mississippi Valley, the northern
Great Lakes, New York and northern Pennsylvania to New England; in
the 80s in southern Florida, southeastern Louisiana and the
southern tip of Texas, and in southwestern Oregon and much of
California; in the 90s in the desert Southwest; and in the 60s or
70s across most of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP ) _ About 100 student protesters
demonstrated outside the monthly meeting of the Yale Corporation on
Saturday to demand that the university sell off stock in
corporations doing business with South Africa.
   The demonstration was sponsored by the Black Student Alliance at
Yale and the Coalition Against Apartheid.
   As of June 1987, according to figures released by the Yale
Office of Public Information, the university had invested $213
million in corporations doing business in South Africa.
   Most board members refused to comment on the divestment issue or
the protest as they left the meeting. One, Maxine Frank-Singer,
said, ``There are always considerations of divestments because we
are constantly monitoring (the companies).'' But she said the
corporation didn't discuss changing the policy.

<HEAD>Cuomo Moves to Close Door on Draft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo moved Saturday to close the door on a
draft for the Democratic presidential nomination, while in his home
state Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson campaigned for next week's
primary in hopes of breaking the logjam in the race to the
convention.
   Cuomo said he did not ``want any confusing signals to be sent to
anyone,'' but may have done just that: Moments after he said he
``ruled out'' accepting a draft, an aide denied that that was what
the governor meant.
   Cuomo's presence has loomed over the campaign for the April 19
presidential primary in New York, where the 255 delegates at stake
could have a crucial impact on the overall race for the Democratic
nomination. Dukakis and Jackson currently are separated by a
relative handful of delegates.
   Cuomo said last year that he did not want to run for president
in 1988, but he has been mentioned time and again as a possible
draft candidate if the party becomes deadlocked over a nominee.
   Cuomo told a news conference Saturday in Albany, N.Y., that a
``draft is counterproductive and unwise,'' but when pressed by
reporters to say whether he would refuse one, Cuomo _ as he has
done in the past _ complained about the ``insistence for magic
language.''
   He later telephoned The Associated Press to clarify his remarks
at the news conference and again was asked specifically whether he
would rule out accepting a draft.
   Cuomo replied: ``I've ruled it out'' and went on to point out
that he had done so in a letter to Democratic Party Chairman Paul
Kirk.
   Moments after the story on Cuomo's statement was transmitted,
his press secretary, Gary Fryer, denied that the governor had
intended to say he would refuse a draft but meant instead that a
draft should not take place.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, made a brief side trip from New York to
Pennsylvania, where he told people at a union parade that he would
press for a national law setting strict requirements for companies
wanting to close their plants.
   ``I know what you've been going through here in the Mon
(Monongahela) Valley,'' Dukakis said in California, Pa., which has
seen thousands of jobs lost in the last 10 years as nearby steel
mills and coal mines have closed down or laid off employees.
   ``I'm not just a talker, I'm a doer. I know what it's like to
work with communities like this one,'' Dukakis said. ``I know what
it takes to bring them back.''
   Asked if that was meant as criticism of Jackson, Dukakis said:
``No, it's a statement of fact about the strengths I bring to this
campaign.''
   Jackson campaigned Saturday in Brooklyn, where he drew large
crowds and at one point was greeted by steel drum music of a
calypso band as he arrived to speak at an Episcopalian church.
   Jackson, when asked about criticism leveled against him by New
York Mayor Ed Koch over his postitions on the Middle East, said,
``In my campaign I want to keep working on healing people. ...
We're already in a very tender situation and responsible leadership
must move to heal people and not to extend their fears.''
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. stayed in Washington Saturday and
planned to resume campaigning in New York on Sunday.
   While the Democrats struggled for their nomination, Vice
President George Bush cruised across the South Saturday on Air
Force Two attending Republican fund-raisers in Texas and Florida.
   While his campaign approached the legal limit for raising money
and was not starved for cash, Bush longed for some of the attention
that has gone elsewhere since he secured a virtual lock on the GOP
nomination.
   ``I've got to look more frantic,'' the vice president joked.
``You pick up the papers and it's all the three (Democratic)
campaigns there. ... And we're finished.''

<TEXT>
   Women with tickets got in, photographers
were kept out, and the previously male-only 40 & 8 Lasociete's
annual oyster dinner and political get-together went off without a
hitch.
   The group, an offshoot of the American Legion, had earlier said
it would continue to bar women from its 25th annual fund-raising
dinner at Mount View High School on Friday night.
   But after Republican congressional candidate Marianne Brewster
kicked up a fuss, the group backed down and said any woman with a
previously purchased ticket would be admitted. No tickets were sold
at the door.
   The group also barred news photographers from the dinner, but
allowed one television crew inside.
   Brewster was one of a handful of women who showed up at the
event, which drew about 1,200 people. State Democratic Chairwoman
Sally Richardson was the guest of state Sen. H. Truman Chafin, who
was indicted Thursday on a felony bribery charge.
   Chafin said he wouldn't let an indictment keep him from an
important political rally, while Richardson said she had made the
appointment to attend the dinner with Chafin ``some time ago.''
   Society members were unhappy about the women's presence and the
press coverage that preceded the event.
   ``It's no good,'' said Larry Johnson of Kimball. ``Men like to
be together by themselves once in a while.''
   The oyster dinner is a traditional campaign stop for state and
local politicians as well as a way of raising money for youth
sports programs.
   Society member J.R. Miller said the group planned to meet Sunday
to decide whether the event will be terminated because of this
year's controversy. When announcing its decision to let women in
this year, the group indicated this would be the final year for the
event.

   George Bush, his lock on the
Republican convention assured and his campaign coffers filled,
fretted Saturday that Democrats are capturing all the attention.
   ``I've got to look more frantic,'' he joked to reporters
travelling with him on Air Force Two.
   `You pick up the papers and it's all the three (Democratic)
campaigns there. ... And we're finished,'' the vice president said.
   Bush, running virtually unopposed for the GOP nomination, said
he hoped to retain visibility between now and the convention ``with
events. There are things we can do to give us a little more
attention.''
   Aides said that an official foreign trip in early summer was a
distinct possibility.
   ``I think we've just got to recognize ... we're not going to get
the intensive political coverage,'' Bush said.
   ``But that doesn't bother me. The spotlight is so sharp,'' he
said. ``Once the convention starts, you don't worry about it.''
   In Miami, Bush told reporters that any trip he took out of the
country ``would have to be substantive, not cosmetic.''
   Bush attended a $250-a-plate fund-raising barbecue and had a
similar event planned for later in the day in Miami.
   The vice president is campaigning at a leisurely pace, with a
series of fund raisers arranged before his campaign last week
reached the $27 million federal limit for pre-convention
contributions.
   Bush staff aides said money raised on the current two-day swing
through Texas and Florida, and from events scheduled for next week
in New York and Connecticut, will be used toward a $2.8 million
``compliance fund.''
   The fund, which is exempt from the federal limit, will be used
for expenses incurred in complying with Federal Election Commission
rules.
   Once those funds are raised, however, the well-heeled campaign
will accept no further contributions itself but will turn its
attention to helping the Republican National Committee raise some
$8 million for the general election, according to campaign
treasurer Fred Bush.
   Bush said he intends to continue campaigning, particularly in
populous states with primaries to come.``There is no way that
anybody is going to get elected in this country if you don't pay
proper attention to the big states,'' Bush told reporters.
   ``I will flesh out and extend the themes that we have talked
about all during the primary,'' he said.
   ``I don't think I have to have a six-point program on every
subject ... but I think the voters will want to know what I'm going
to do on some of these important areas.''
   The general election contest ``is going to be close and it is
going to be a tough race,'' he said.
   ``It always is after an eight-year cycle,'' he said later in an
interview with local reporters.
   Bush said Democrats Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis ``believe
the same things on how to solve the problems of this country and
they're both wrong.''
   ``Both of them come out of the more liberal tradition,'' he said.
   Aides said Bush would probably campaign for two or three days
each week between now and the summer conventions. Campaign
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said that
an out-of-country official visit for the vice president was likely
in June, either to Europe or the Far East, in an effort to raise
his visibility.
   Late Friday, Bush and his wife, Barbara, made a surprise
appearance in Fort Worth at a lampoon dinner sponsored by Texas
journalists.
   ``There must be some mistake,'' Bush told the annual Texas
Gridiron dinner. ``I thought this was the wimp convention.''
   His self-mocking joke brought howls from the audience.

<HEAD>Police, Tanks Patrol Rubble-Strewn Streets To Block Further
Rioting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police patrolled Tegucigalpa's
streets Saturday under the state of emergency imposed to quell two
days of anti-American riots that left five people dead and the U.S.
consulate burned.
   The state of emergency decreed Friday by the government of
President Jose Azcona, which gave authorities sweeping powers to
crack down on the demonstrations, brought a forced calm to the
country.
   Troops also patrolled the capital in light tanks and trucks.
Military units guarded bridges, government ministries and key
intersections.
   Radio and television stations were forced to suspend regular
programming under the emergency order as authorities maintained
control of broadcast outlets for the second straight day.
   At intervals an announcer read communiques from the government's
information secretariat.
   The government blamed Thursday night's attacks on the U.S.
Embassy compound on what it called a small group of Marxist
radicals. The mob, estimated at nearly 2,000 people, burned and
sacked the U.S. consulate and offices of the U.S. Information
Service, but did not penetrate the embassy portion of the complex.
   Five people, all Hondurans, were reported killed Thursday night.
The violence began with a student-led demonstration to protest the
arrest Tuesday of accused drug trafficker Juan Ramon Matta and his
extradition to the United States.
   On Tuesday, Honduran officials took Matta from his Tegucigalpa
home in a pre-dawn raid and placed him on a plane to the Dominican
Republic.
   Dominican Republic officials put Matta on a New York-bound
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals.
   Matta, held at the maximum-security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985
slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Some Honduran legislators called the handling of Matta a
``kidnapping'' and the Foreign Ministry ordered an investigation of
the procedures used.
   The Honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of citizens.
But Honduran authorities, working in concert with U.S. officials,
seized Matta.
   The two days of rioting was the worst anti-American
demonstration in Latin America this year. Although the protests
were carried out largely by leftists who are regular critics of
U.S. policies, the extradition of Matta was seen by many as a
flagrant violation of Honduran law.
   Other anti-American sentiment apparently was fueled by the
presence in Honduras last month of 3,200 U.S. military personnel
dispatched after Nicaraguan government forces reported encroached
on Honduran land to pursue Nicraguan rebels, known as Contras. The
3,200 U.S. troops returned to America within two weeks.
   Many Hondurans oppose the presence of the bases of the
U.S.-backed Contras in Honduras.
   The disturbances that began Thursday continued Friday, with
police using tear gas to break up concentrations of protestors.
   Lawmakers, newspaper columnists and academics denounced Matta's
arrest. Government statements spoke in general terms of drug
traffickers and Marxists.
   One said, ``The state's intelligence has detected a vast plan
that terrorist elements serving foreign ideas, in conjunction with
international drug traffickers, intended to carry out to sow chaos
and disorder.''
   Another said, ``We call on all sectors _ campesinos, private
enterprise, students and professionals _ so that the people,
government and armed forces can together slam the door on the
penetration of Marxism-Leninism in our country.''
   International drug dealers ``have reached the extreme of
threatening to assassinate high officials of the republic and of
the armed forces,'' a third statement said.
   The government also said elements of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front were involved in the violence. The
leftist guerrilla group is waging a civil war in neighboring El
Salvador.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy denied any guards at the
mission fired on the rioters Thursday night. The spokesman, who
commented on condition of anonymity, also said no U.S. agents took
part in Matta's arrest.
   Police sources in Tegucigalpa, who spoke with the condition they
not be identified, said two members of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Adeministration were present when Matta was seized.
   The embassy spokesman said Honduran security forces delayed for
more than two hours before going to the embassy compound to help
disperse the rioters.
   ``There were Honduran police in the area, sitting on their
thumbs. We have asked for an explanation at the highest level,'' he
said. ``This is a matter of intense and urgent discussion.''

<HEAD>Japanese Billionaire Pays Record $38 Million For Rest of Kaiser
Estate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of Japan's wealthiest men has added to his
extensive Hawaii real estate holdings by paying a record $38
million to acquire the remaining 5.5 acres of the Kaiser Estate,
his attorney said.
   Billionaire Genshiro Kawamoto paid $4.5 million earlier this
year to purchase the estate's ``Picnic House'' property and picked
up an option to buy the rest of the estate built by industrialist
Henry Kaiser.
   When another interested buyer offered $38 million, Kawamoto
exercised his option, according to his attorney, Robert J. Lombardi.
   Real estate agent Scully Rogers, broker for the sale, and
appraiser Robert Hastings said the purchase price was the highest
ever paid for a residential property in Hawaii.
   The previous record of $21 million was set in March, also by a
Japanese buyer.
   Hawaii has drawn more Japanese property investment than any
other state, including an estimated $3 billion since 1986, and the
increasing Japanese appetite has sparked controversy recently.
   Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi last month proposed state legislation
to prohibit the sale of residential, agricultural or preservation
property to anyone who is not a U.S. citizen, has no plans to
become a citizen or would not live on the land at least half the
year. The proposal has little chance of being considered by the
legislature because it was submitted late in the session.
   Kawamoto has spent an additional $36.9 million to buy 130 acres
of land and 142 homes and condominiums on Oahu, the island where
Honolulu is located.
   Kawamoto said Friday he planned to use the estate, sold by a
trust for the Goldman family, as a vacation home while in Hawaii on
monthly trips from Japan.
   The Picnic House purchase included nearly two acres of land and
a boat harbor. The latest purchase includes two houses and an
Olympic-size swimming pool.
   ``To go through them is like a James Bond movie,'' Rogers said.
``You lose track of the amenities because you are so in awe of
them.''

<TEXT>
   Real estate tycoon Donald Trump was
saved $86,000 when a court ruled that his taxes on a 118-room
mansion should be based on its purchase price, not on the county's
calculation of its value.
   Trump bought Mar-A-Lago in 1985 for $7 million. It was the first
time the estate built in 1926 had been sold.
   However, Palm Beach County property appraisers had valued the
property at $11.5 million and Trump's taxes were figured on that
basis.
   Circuit Judge Richard Burk ruled in Trump's favor on Friday.
   ``It is significant to note that this is the only purchase ever
of this property,'' Burk said. ``Surely in this case, one sale does
in fact make a market.''
   Trump's attorney, Robb Maass, said the decision was ``a very
proper way of looking at the market value.''
   But attorney Gaylord Wood, who represented Palm Beach County
Property Appraiser Rebecca Walker, promised to appeal.
   ``Donald Trump has demonstrated once again that there is no one
better in this country at buying things for less than what they are
worth,'' Wood said.
   Trump challenged the assessment in a 1987 lawsuit after the
county said he owed $208,000 in taxes on Mar-a-Lago. Trump
contended that the bill should be only $122,000, including a 4
percent discount for early payment.
   During two days of testimony last month, two real estate
appraisers explained the methods they used to place a value on
Mar-a-Lago. Even though both appraisers used a system that
considers the value of comparable properties, their assessments
were $3.4 million apart.
   In his ruling, however, Burk wrote that Trump's $7 million
purchase price established Mar-a-Lago's market value because the
estate has no equal.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 10th graf, A Soviet, with name of Cohen's book</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen Cohen of Princeton University was
taken aback when, during the summit in Washington last December,
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he'd read Cohen's biography
of Nikolai Bukharin, a Bolshevik theoretician who for 50 years was
a ``non-person.''
   A month later, Cohen stood before a packed lecture hall in
Moscow and led what he says ``must have been the first public
discussion (in the Soviet Union) of Bukharin since he was executed,
in March 1938.''
   American historians of Russia, for years denounced by the
Kremlin as ``bourgeois falsifiers,'' are now finding eager ears in
Moscow as Soviet scholars heed Gorbachev's call to fill in the
``blank pages'' in Soviet history books.
   Cohen has been at the forefront, because his writings have been
among the most thorough examinations of the theory that Joseph
Stalin's bloody collectivization of agriculture, forced
industrialization and purge of the party were needless.
   Despite Gorbachev's reforms, however, the Stalinist form of
government remains largely intact and until Gorbachev came to
power, official histories praised Stalin.
   Even now, the rewriting of history is directed by central
Communist Party authorities.
   Another American historian, Robert V. Daniels of the University
of Vermont, says he is going to Moscow this fall to discuss with
Soviet historians their efforts fill in the blanks.
   ``I make no bones about my independent position,'' said Daniels,
who has been much more critical than Cohen of many aspects of
Soviet history. ``I have been frequently denounced in the Soviet
press as a `bourgeois falsifier' and all that sort of thing.''
   But Soviet scholars have told Daniels, ``you won't have to take
that any more. They are interested in hearing what you have to
say.'' He said Russian scholars have encouraged him to submit
articles to Soviet journals.
   A Soviet historian, Yuri Mukhachev, denied speculation that the
Soviets might go so far as to publish Cohen's biography of
Bukharin, ``Bukharin and The Bolshevik Revolution; A Political
Biography 1888-1938,'' and a book by Daniels, ``Conscience of the
Revolution.''
   But ``as to scholarly debates with our colleagues in the West
concerning Soviet history, we are willing to engage them,''
Mukhachev said in answer to questions posed by The Associated Press
through the semiofficial Soviet news agency Novosti.
   Mukhachev took part in a conference with foreign scholars last
May on the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and ``we saw that we had more
points in common than differences on a lot of topics.''
   Many important episodes of Soviet history remain outside the
bounds of official scholarship, despite the rehabilitation of
Bukharin. Among them are:
   _The central role of Leon Trotsky, murdered in Mexico on
Stalin's orders, in directing the Bolshevik revolution and creating
the Red Army.
   _The Bolshevik decision in 1917 to dissolve the Constituent
Assembly, whose anti-Bolshevik majority was considered likely to
form a more democratic form of government;
   _The suppression of religion, including widespread executions;
   _The forced relocation of large ethnic populations under Stalin,
involving hundreds of thousands of deaths;
   _The deaths of thousands of Polish officers at the beginning of
World War II. Western and many unofficial Polish historians blame
the executions on the Russians, but the Soviets blame the Nazis.
Few observers expect an objective assessment from a joint
Soviet-Polish commission appointed to study the issue;
   _The precise number of people who died in the forced
collectivization of agriculture in 1929-32, estimated by Western
historians to be as high as 10 million. Recent Soviet articles have
said that ``millions were repressed,'' but have not delved into the
actual number killed.
   Bukharin was the leading opponent of the collectivization and
the forced industrialization that accompanied it, and many Western
Sovietologists view his rehabilitation as an important step in
rewriting Soviet history.
   To Americans, history may seem the province of tweedy
professors, but the effort to rework the Soviet history books is
central to Gorbachev's drive for economic reform, known as
``perestroika.''
   ``History is one of the principal questions today,'' said the
U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Jack Matlock. ``The degree to which they
can go over the history pages and fill in the blanks is a gauge of
how successful the restructuring can be,'' Matlock said in a recent
lecture in Washington.
   ``Perestroika needs an intellectual basis. They needed to
rehabilitate Bukharin, and they need to deal with Stalin,'' said
Matlock, one of the leading U.S. government experts on the Soviet
Union.
   Gorbachev has been nudging Bukharin back into vogue. Last
November, he became the first Soviet leader in 50 years to publicly
utter Bukharin's name, which had been systematically excised from
Soviet books and newspapers.
   Several days after Cohen spoke in Moscow, the authoritative
Soviet journal ``Kommunist'' published a long-forbidden article by
Bukharin. And in February the Communist Party rehabilitated
Bukharin, who was accused of treason and executed on Stalin's
orders at the height of the purges.
   The next likely steps are the rehabilitation of Bukharin's ideas
and the publishing of new histories and text books reflecting the
change in official thinking.

<HEAD>Jackson Campaigns Before Racially Diverse, Overflow Crowds in New
York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BROOKLYN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson,
saying that ``people are coming alive'' to his presidential
candidacy, campaigned Saturday before racially diverse, overflow
crowds of New Yorkers.
   He avoided direct bickering with Mayor Ed Koch over Jewish
concerns, but he did take a sideswipe at Koch when asked if the
mayor's negative comments were hurting him in New York.
   Jackson said his campaign is focused on ``healing,'' and without
mentioning Koch's name, suggested the mayor is heightening
black-Jewish tension. In light of various recent incidents of
racial violence, he said, ``We are already in a very tender
situation. And responsible leadership must move to heal people and
not extend their fears.''
   Jackson told each of his enthusiastic audiences from Crown
Heights to Coney Island, ``I love you very much.''
   As New York's April 19 primary looms, Jackson also said that in
fairness, he should be the overall leader not only in the popular
vote to date, but in presidential delegates.
   He said he earned the at-large delegates from the Illinois
primary last month but is being kept from receiving them by Sen.
Paul Simon of Illinois, who is no longer an active candidate but is
clinging to his delegates.
   Jackson suggested Simon should withdraw formally and said, ``I'm
simply appealing for consistency and fairness.''
   Jackson devoted the day of rallies and speeches in Brooklyn to
discussing his ``economic justice'' message and emphasizing his
positions on the Caribbean, Haiti, Panama and South Africa.
   Crowds that could not fit into the churches and halls where he
spoke lined the streets and stood on fire escapes.
   Security around Jackson was intense as he waded into the throngs
of people who mobbed him, shaking hands and holding babies.
   Jackson called his campaign ``hope reborn'' and said, ``People
are coming alive.''
   In trendy Park Slope, Jackson addressed a racially mixed outdoor
rally of a few thousand.
   In Crown Heights, he was greeted by a steel drum Calypso band,
and he delighted the sidewalk crowd by taking up a tambourine and
bouncing to the beat.
   In Coney Island, several hundred screaming supporters lined the
block outside the church where he was to speak, chanting ``Go
Jesse.''
   But he was dogged by questions about Koch's criticisms, most
recently in Saturday's New York Times where Koch was quoted as
saying Jackson is evading talking about issues of concern to Jews.
   As the candidate emerged from speaking to a wildly enthusiastic
black audience in St. Mark's Episcopal Church, about two dozen
dark-suited Orthodox Jewish men stood somberly at the edge of about
200 supporters waiting outside.
   They listened quietly while the rest of the onlookers cheered
Jackson wildly as he talked about brotherhood.
   The group said they came out of curiosity. One, who declined to
give his name because he said he should not give interviews on the
Sabbath, said he planned to vote for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, and that if Jackson wins the Democratic nomination, ``I'll
vote Republican.''
   Another said he was supporting Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee, but of Jackson, he said, ``I think he's great. I just
wish he knew more about the Middle East.''
   In an impromptu address to the crowd, Jackson shouted without a
microphone about New York's multicultural, multi-ethnic character.
   ``We seek to draw people together across lines of race and sex
and religion,'' he said to rapt cheers from the largely black crowd.
   ``We know what makes us different _ our race, our sex, our
religion, our culture. But what binds us together?''
   In answer, he listed central issues of his candidacy: economic
justice, fighting drugs, improving child care and education.
   Later, Jackson told reporters seeking his reaction to Koch's
remarks, ``We are dealing with a highly politicized situation and
you expect some of that but we'll keep our eyes on our real
agenda.''
   He refused to be drawn into a tit-for-tat with Koch.
   ``Our campaign is an outreach campaign,'' he said. ``We're going
to keep it at that level.''
   However, he denied evading any issues, noting that he has spoken
often about the Middle East. He supports a Palestinian homeland and
repeated Saturday his call for recognition of Israel by the Arab
states.
   On foreign policy, Jackson said the United States should demand
free and fair elections and human rights in Haiti.
   He called for U.S. humanitarian aid to the Panamanian people who
are suffering under U.S. sanctions aimed at ousting Panamanian
strong man General Manuel Noriega.
   He said he supports the sanctions, but also said there should be
a congressional investigation of the CIA 's past role with Noriega.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Saturday, ``I've ruled
out a draft'' for the Democratic presidential nomination, but he
declined to endorse a candidate until after the primaries end June
7.
   At a news conference Saturday and in two later conversations
with The Associated Press, Cuomo said he did not want the
Democratic party to draft him or anybody else as its presidential
nominee.
   But in the second conversation with the AP, he refused to say
point-blank that he would turn down the nomination if he were
drafted at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta July 18-21.
   Cuomo was attempting to douse a draft movement begun during the
week by a former Democratic congressman, but the confusion arose
when he declined to close the door on circumstances that might
arise at the convention.
   ``I've ruled out a draft,'' Cuomo said.
   Cuomo's statements about a draft and endorsements came as he
released a letter to former New York Rep. Richard Ottinger, a
leader of a draft-Cuomo move in New York, asking him ``not to go
forward with your intention to encourage a draft.''
   In his letter, Cuomo also said he would not endorse any of the
Democratic candidates before the end of the primaries June 7. The
governor explained that he wanted to be uncommitted at that point
so he could help the front-runner collect enough uncommitted votes
to put him over the top for the nomination.
   Asked to clarify his statements on a draft, Cuomo told the AP,
``We can go around forever. ... I could have ended it a long time
ago by saying `General Sherman said and so I will say,' but I'm not
going to do that because that means that you accept the principle
that you have to use whatever language the press says you must use
to meet their requirements and they'll keep inventing new
language.''
   It was Civil War Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman who rejected an
appeal to draft him as the Republican nominee in 1884 with the
political disclaimer: ``I will not accept if nominated and will not
serve if elected.''
   ``I'm not going to use your language,'' said Cuomo. ``I said,
`How could I rule it out as counterproductive and unwise and still
accept it?' I have ruled it out.''
   Cuomo announced more than a year ago that he would not seek his
party's presidential nomination and has taken steps to keep his
name off state primary ballots.
   And despite his repeated insistence that he did not want to be a
candidate questions have persisted over whether he would accept the
nomination if it were offered to him anyway.
   Cuomo started out Saturday with a news conference in which he
indicated that he would reject a draft but when pressed to clarify
his position, he complained to reporters about ``your insistence
for magic language.''
   After the news conference, he telephoned the AP to say he was
making his statement because ``obviously this is in the midst of
the New York primary (campaign) and I don't want any confusing
signals to be sent to anyone.''
   But the confusion continued.
   After a story was transmitted saying that Cuomo ruled out
accepting a draft, his press secretary, Gary Fryer, called to draw
the line at the word ``accept.''
   ``I asked him that specifically and he said `I never told him
that; I'm not going to tell him that,''' Fryer said.

   The missile was launched from a launch pad aboard the ship in

   The Tomahawk accurately hit three targets on the China Lake test

<DATELINE>BIKINI ATOLL, Marshall Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decades after residents of
this remote coral atoll left to make way for U.S. atomic bomb
tests, work has begun to clean up lingering radiation and bring the
``nuclear nomads'' of Bikini home to stay.
   Some 50 Bikini leaders and a delegation of U.S. officials
gathered on the windswept island of Eneu last week to mark the
start of the cleanup and resettlement project.
   Eneu is now the only inhabited island of the approximately two
dozen islands that comprise the Bikini atoll. It is on the
southeast tip of the island ring, about five miles south of the
island of Bikini.
   Officials say it could take seven years of work before the
Bikinians can safely repopulate Bikini island, and estimates of the
cleanup cost range from $130 million to $200 million.
   Tomaki Juda, mayor of the Marshall Islands' Kili Island, where
many Bikinians now live, said Thursday's groundbreaking ``isn't a
day of great happiness.''
   ``A day of great happiness for the Bikinian people will be
coming back to an island that is free of radiation and which we can
stay on without being afraid,'' Juda said through an interpreter.
   ``The ceremony this afternoon marks the beginning of a great
effort, but we cannot celebrate until the radioactivity has been
removed from the coral soil of our home island,'' said Henchi
Balos, a senator representing the Bikinians and acting president of
the Marshall Islands.
   Juda and Balos were among 146 people who left Bikini in 1946,
when U.S. officials told them the western Pacific atoll was needed
for testing the atom bomb. The Americans promised to return the
islanders to Bikini when tests were completed.
   Between 1946 and 1958 the United States detonated 23 nuclear
bombs at Bikini, an atoll of islands surrounding a lagoon 24 miles
long and 11 miles wide.
   The American promise was something the Bikinians wanted the
delegation _ including Rep. Barbara Vucanovich, R-Nev., and
congressional staff members _ to remember.
   ``There are only a few elders left who know our traditional
customs and it will not be long until they are gone also,'' Juda
said. ``We hope it will not be long before we can restore our
traditions.''
   Vucanovich, a member of the House Subcommittee on Energy and
Environment, told the Bikinians the time had come for the United
States to fulfill its promise to return them home.
   ``These small islands have paid a great price for the freedom we
have all enjoyed,'' she said. ``Now it's up to us, using our
scientific advances, to ensure that Bikini will once again give
abundant life to those who live here.''
   A small group of Bikinians returned in the early 1970s when
radiation levels were thought safe. But tests in 1978 found they
were ingesting dangerous amounts of radioactive materials drawn up
from the soil by food plants, and they were evacuated.
   ``Today, the question is, `Is this a true dream?''' Juda said.
``Are we going to be able to come back here?''
   Since their exodus, the Bikinians have moved several times
through the Marshalls, hence the nickname ``nuclear nomads.'' The
largest group settled at Kili, an island 500 miles south of Bikini.
   Congress appropriated $2.3 million for the cleanup and
resettlement project this year. Most was earmarked for design and
engineering for Bikini Island, but some will be used to begin
development of a base camp on Eneu, which has an airstrip.
   The problem on Bikini Island is the radioactive cesium-137 in
its soil. The radioactive isotope has a half life of about 30
years, meaning it takes that time for half of it to decay; in an
additional 30 years half of the remainder will decay.
   The danger from direct exposure is minute, scientists say, but
without controlling or removing the cesium-137 they say Bikini's
soil might not produce plants safe for human consumption until
sometime in the 21st century.
   With treatment, researchers say the Bikinians could begin
returning to their home island within seven years.
   Larry L. Morgan of the Interior Department's Office of
Territorial and International Affairs said his department, which
oversees the project, is awaiting a report on cleanup alternatives
before requesting funding. The report is due July 31.
   Scientists are considering three alternatives: removing the
topsoil in which the radioactive cesium is concentrated, treating
the soil with potassium to prevent plants from absorbing the
cesium, and flushing the soil with seawater.

<TEXT>
   A judge has cleared the way for a state
agency to pay for a liver transplant for a 5-year-old Mexican boy
with chronic liver disease, who previously was denied aid because
he was not a U.S. resident.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Olsen rejected a California
Children's Services request Friday that would have made Armando
Vargas ineligible for state funds for the operation, which costs
approximately $150,000. The judge found that the boy is eligible
because his guardian is a California resident.
   Sharon Yackey, the deputy Los Angeles County counsel
representing Children's Services, a branch of the state Department
of Health Services, said the agency would not appeal the ruling.
   She also said the agency had approved funding for the operation
and contacted officials at the University of California, Los
Angeles, Medical Center, requesting that the boy be placed on the
hospital's donor list for a new liver.
   Armando and his family came to California seven weeks ago from
their home in central Mexico in hopes of getting the state-funded
surgery. They had previously been turned down in Texas.
   The boy, who doctors say can live only a matter of months
without a transplant, was not eligible for aid because he is not a
legal U.S. resident.
   But after news reports of his case, a group called the Right to
Life Committee established a guardianship for him so he could
qualify.
   On Friday, Olsen denied the California Children's Services
request to vacate the guardianship.
   The judge ruled that the boy was not a legal resident, but he
also determined that, as a ward of a legal guardian who is a
resident, the youth qualifies for the funds.
   ``It's an exciting victory,'' said Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a
spokeswoman for the Right to Life Committee.

<HEAD>Tennessee Walking Horse Industry to Fight Ruling Limiting Gait
Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Walking Horse breeders are
seeking a stay of a recent court ruling restricting the use of
devices that give the horses their distinctive high-stepping
stride, their attorney said.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently banned the stacked
shoes and limited the weight of leg chains used in showing the
horses.
   The department's ban followed a ruling last month by U.S.
District Judge Oliver Gasch, who ordered the new regulations after
reviewing a suit filed by the American Horse Protection Association
against the department. The association charged that the devices
caused soreness and swelling in the animals' legs.
   Proponents argued they are being penalized for abuses corrected
long ago, when chemical irritants were used on horses' hooves. They
say the new rules threaten the entire industry.
   The Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors'
Association will present arguments seeking a stay from Gasch on
Tuesday in Washington, said Walter Bussart, an attorney for the
group.
   The rules forbid the use of bracelet-like chains weighing more
than 6 ounces and padded shoes for walking horses. Chains of up to
10 ounces and stacked shoes 4 inches high had previously been
allowed.
   Several walking horse shows have been canceled or postponed
since Gasch's ruling in March, including one set for next weekend
in Jackson, Miss. That show is tentatively rescheduled for October,
officials said.
   The walking horse season usually ends with the National
Celebration in Shelbyville, Tenn., in September. Breeders have said
that show is also threatened unless the judge's ruling is stayed or
altered.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s campaign has all but
given up on winning the New York primary on April 19 but wants a
strong enough showing to rekindle doubts about Michael Dukakis,
thus allowing for a late charge at the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   ``We've got to prove we can get a lot of Northern votes,'' said
one aide, speaking anonymnously. ``And if we do that I think the
race gets shaken up once again.''
   But Gore has been trying to find a Northern state where he could
run strongly since he vaulted near the front of the pack with
several border state victories on Super Tuesday a month ago.
   Since then, his campaign has encountered a string of defeats in
Illinois, Michigan, Connecticut, Wisconsin and elsewhere while
piling up a debt of $1.5 million. Even though he spent as much or
more on television advertising in some states as Dukakis, his best
showing of the past four weeks was 17 percent of the vote in
Wisconsin a week ago.
   He has gained only 49 delegates since Super Tuesday in The
Associated Press delegate count and now trails rivals Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson by more than 300 delegates.
   Thus, one aide conceded, and if he fails in New York, it will be
``very very difficult to go on in a meaningful way.''
   Nevertheless, Gore campaign manager Fred Martin insisted on
Saturday that strategy in New York is to win, not just do well.
   ``It's certainly true that we're underdogs,'' Martin said.
``It's certainly true that we're behind in the polls, but we are
trying to win this state.''
   ``Anyone who says differently doesn't know what he's talking
about,'' Martin said by telephone from New York.
   At least one Democrat says failure in New York could do more
than spell the end of Gore's 1988 Democratic candidacy,
particularly given the senator's decision to criticize black rival
Jackson.
   ``He'd better be careful that he's not burning bridges. New York
may pose a much more serious long-term risk to Gore than he may
imagine,'' said Robert G. Beckel, who is not advising any of this
year's Democratic presidential contenders after managing Walter F.
Mondale's bid in 1984.
   Beckel said that by attacking Jackson, Gore risks the animosity
of black voters not only in a national campaign, but in his home
state of Tennessee. ``It's a very risky strategy, and I frankly see
a lot more downside than I see upside for him.''
   An occasional adviser said that the impact on a future campaign
is on Gore's mind as he makes the rounds in 1988. ``Al believes
he's old enough to be president but too young to be vice president.
He hopes to leave a good impression and maybe he'll try again some
day,'' said this source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At the Dukakis campaign, aides believe that Gore cannot win the
nomination, but they fear that he could seriously damage their own
man's chances if he split the white vote and enabled Jackson to eke
out a victory.
   Thus, they seek to belittle Gore whenever they can, with Dukakis
pointing out that the senator has failed to carry a dingle
congressional district since Super Tuesday.
   ``We see it as a two-man race'' with Jackson, says Susan
Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager. ``He's had one good day in this
campaign as far as I can tell,'' she said referring to Gore's
six-state victorties on Super Tuesday.
   Gore himself has not publicly discussed the long-term
implications of next week's primary, with 255 delegates at stake.
``New York has always been friendly to underdogs, and I am the
underdog,'' he said last week.
   To achieve his New York goal, Gore is making a strong appeal to
win New York's sizeable Jewish vote, supporting Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's opposition to the Reagan administration's
peace proposal. And despite a $1.5 million campaign debt, has
embarked on a costly advertising campaign that also stresses his
record on environmental, civil rights and consumer issues in a bid
to woo voters who want a moderate alternative to Dukakis and
Jackson.
   In personal campaigning, Gore has attacked both Jackson and
Dukakis for lacking sufficient foreign policy experience. He
accused aides to the Massachusetts governor last week of saying
that a vote for Gore was a vote for Jackson _ a charge that Dukakis
denied. He also has accused Dukakis of being ``absurdly timid'' in
his treatment of Jackson.
   Coming at a time when many party officials are anxious to avoid
a prolonged battle for the nomination, Gore's criticisms have
earned him rebukes from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Democratic
Party Chairman Paul Kirk. ``It does not work and it's terribly
dangerous,'' Cuomo told one interviewer.
   Gore shook off the criticism and made it clear he intends to
continue portraying his rivals as short on foreign policy
experience. Spokesman Arlie Schardt said the senator ``is going to
continue campaigning just as vigorously pointing out the difference
with Dukakis and Jackson.''
   Schardt said the Gore campaign didn't view his comments as
negative campaigning, and aides said they knew of no current plans
for television commercials that would attack Dukakis or Jackson.
   Gore's aides concede he is starting at the back of the pack in
New York campaign _ his support in public polls is measured in
single digits _ but they insist a strong showing can scramble the
Democratic race.
   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gore hopes to
enlist the support of Democrats who fear that Dukakis cannot lead
the party to victory in the fall, although the senator has
generally dropped this refrain in recent weeks.
   One aide says that when Jackson became the hot candidate in the
race recently, the fear over Dukakis ``was temporarily shelved
because Jackson is even less electable.''
   ``If we get a meaningful bite out of the apple (in New York) we
can go on to meaningful victories in other Northern states,''
including Pennsylvahia, Ohio and elsewhere, said one adviser.

<HEAD>Technical Talks Suspended But Negotiator Optimistic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and rebel officials are not
far from agreeing on technical aspects of a cease-fire even though
they suspended discussions because of some differences, a
negotiator said Saturday.
   ``I'm optimistic,'' said Paul Reichler, a Washington attorney
who is with the Sandinista government's negotiating delegation.
``We've come this far.''
   Talks between military leaders of the government and the rebels,
known as Contras, broke off Friday after four days of discussions.
Negotiators are dealing with the technical aspects of a 60-day
cease-fire that formally went into effect on April 1.
   Both sides agreed on seven zones where the Contras are to gather
during the cease-fire, but failed to agree on how the rebels would
receive supplies and ways of verifying compliance with the truce.
   The cease-fire is part of a peace plan leaders of the warring
parties agreed to on March 23. The pact called for the rebels to
gather in the cease-fire zones by April 15, but left details for
carrying out that plan to later technical discussions.
   On Thursday the Contras released a 34-point proposal outlining
rebel activity in the zones. The Sandinistas on Friday released a
25-point plan for the zones.
   Reichler said there were only two points in the Contra proposal
that were ``absolutely unacceptable, non-negotiable.''
   He said one would allow the rebels to ``periodically replace
arms, ammunition and war material, and the other would bar the
government from receiving military aid during the truce. Most of
Nicaragua's arms come from the Soviet bloc.
   Reichler said the Sandinistas were frustrated at not reaching an
agreement after six meetings. Earlier talks were held between
military delegations March 28-29.
   He said the Contras were unwilling to continue the talks
Saturday and called for a four-day recess.
   ``We're talking about a cease-fire, people's lives, and they
want to work 10-to-5 with a two-hour lunch,'' Reichler said.
   The government said technical subjects could be discussed
Friday, when high-level talks are scheduled to be held in Managua.
Those talks, called for under the peace plan, were to have opened
last Wednesday but the Contras asked for a postponement.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero, in an interview from Miami, said
the Sandinistas were to blame for the breakdown of the technical
talks.
   He said he was not sure the Friday meeting would be held because
the government has not responded to the Contras' demand for free
access to political opposition figures during their visit to the
capital.
   In the peace pact, the rebels agreed to accept only humanitarian
aid delivered by a neutral organization, such as the International
Red Cross.
   The Sandinistas are insisting on inspection, but would allow the
goods to be delivered by air, land or sea to the zones.
   The Sandinistas have agreed to gradually release 3,300 political
prisoners, allow the Contras to take part in political dialogue and
restore democratic freedoms.
   Some 50,000 people have been killed or wounded in six years of
fighting.
   The peace plan was signed after three days of talks at the
border post at Sapoa, 90 miles south of Managua.

   The Oscar show will keep its identity as a
``little Hollywood party'' whose course will be unaffected by the
writers' strike, one of the hosts and the show's producers said
Saturday.
   The 60th Annual Academy Awards show, set for Monday on ABC-TV,
will be broadcast live from the 6,000-seat Shrine Auditorium, the
first time the Oscars have been held there since 1948.
   This year's show will feature virtually all the nominees in
person, and a script that was unfinished when members of the
Writers Guild of America went on strike March 7 against producers
and studios.
   ``You know something, people are making too much of the writers'
strike,'' Oscar co-host Chevy Chase told reporters at a news
conference in front of the Shrine Auditorium.
   ``The writers' strike doesn't affect us as much as you think.
We're really more prepared to do something that's normally
considered ad-lib. It's the nature of the show.''
   Chase told reporters that the material for the show had been
prepared long in advance and said of the Writers Guild, of which he
is a member: ``They've been good to us and we've been good to them.
It's not a big deal.''
   The show for this year ``is probably the most difficult because
we have the change of venue,'' director Marty Passetta said.
   He told reporters that among the problems he faced was the
Shrine's stage, which is 30 feet deep. At the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, the location for the Oscar in previous years, the stage
is 125 feet deep.
   But the cavernous Shrine will allow 19 camera positions this
year, giving the show a greater sense of action, Passetta said.
   Samuel Goldwyn Jr., producer of the show for the second
consecutive year, said the show will try to keep the focus on
movies as well as glamour.
   ``Although this has now become a world famous event, this is
still our own little Hollywood party. It's just become a very big
party,'' he said.
   The show usually lasts more than three hours and Goldwyn has
refused this year to say he will try to keep it under that.
   However, talkative winners this year will have chatty acceptance
speeches electronically overcome. A warning light will flash at
increasing speed as the allotted time wanes, and finally, the
orchestra music will be brought up slowly while the volume of the
podium microphone is turned down.
   ``And then you hear a gunshot,'' Chase joked.
   But film critic Roger Ebert, at the Shrine on assignment for the
Chicago Sun-Times, warned that the hosts rather than award
recipients could lengthen the show.
   ``This could be the comic Olympics. ... These guys have been
brought out this year because they are experienced with live
television. The problem is they're also experienced with working in
front of audiences and getting laughs and ad-libbing and it may
turn into a competition to see who's the funniest,'' he said,
noting that among the co-hosts and presenters are Chase and Eddie
Murphy.
   During the news conference, workers continued putting final
touches on the grandstand and sprucing up the front of the
auditorium. Six 24-foot Oscar statues were in place in front of the
auditorium, which has a Moorish design, complete with filigree
cornices and facade.
   Because workers were still constructing the stands, no
early-bird fans had yet taken up position to capture the most
coveted seat in Hollywood, the grandstand view of the stars'
entrance.
   ``This building looks like the Academy Award should be held
here,'' Ebert said. ``It looks like James Mason and Judy Garland
should be walking into it in a scene from `A Star is Born.'''

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old California boy landed a
small plane Saturday to claim a record as the youngest pilot to fly
across the country and back, a flight of some 6,000 miles.
   Tony Aliengena flew low over John Wayne Airport in Orange County
as family, friends, reporters and photographers awaited, finally
setting the Cessna 210 down about 12:20 p.m.
   The San Juan Capistrano boy, who got his yen for flying from his
pilot father, had set out from John Wayne Airport on March 30,
accompanied by his flight instructor, Ed Fernett, and an observer
from the National Aeronautics Association, a group that verifies
flight records.
   His trip included stops in Texas; Tennessee; North Carolina;
Virginia; Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Indiana; Missouri;
Oklahoma; New Mexico; and Arizona.
   Tony left Phoenix on Saturday morning. When he found himself
ahead of schedule he made a brief stop in Ramona, Calif., so he
wouldn't arrive in Orange County before greeters could gather,
Fernett said.
   Tony, who fields most questions with one-word answers, said he
felt ``good'' and that the last leg wasn't difficult.
   ``It was good weather until we got to the ocean. It got
cloudy,'' he said.
   The boy said he didn't think his celebrity status had affected
his neighborhood friends and that he hasn't had enough of flying.
   ``I want to keep on flying. I want to go around the world,'' he
said.
   Tony set out to beat the record set last August by 10-year-old
Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, Calif., who flew from San Luis
Obispo County to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and back to Burbank, Calif.
   Before his cross-country effort, Tony soloed in an ultra-light
airplane _ a type not regulated by the Federal Aviation
Administration _ at Oceanside Airport to claim a record for the
youngest solo flight.
   Fernett said the return trip to California was easier than the
flight east.
   ``The weather was better so that made everyone relax. We were
having fun with the trip,'' he said.
   Tony also gained experience, particularly with bad weather, that
showed on the trip home, his instructor said.
   ``He was sharper; he was more knowledgeable, relaxed,'' said
Fernett.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy returned Saturday from a
four-day trip overseas that included a visit to Northern Ireland,
saying his public criticism of that country was unavoidable.
   ``If you walk into that kind of situation, with the kind of
siege mentality that exists there, you can only call it what you
see. If that happens to upset people, you let the chips fall where
they may,'' the 35-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said after
landing at Logan International Airport.
   Earlier in the day, Kennedy told a cheering crowd in Wexford,
Ireland, that the British have no right to ``occupy'' Northern
Ireland.
   In response, Britain's energy secretary said Kennedy ``should
get back to Massachusetts as quickly as possible.''
   ``We had a really eye-opening trip to Northern Ireland, into the
tremendous oppression that exists in the area, into the
intimidation of Irish Catholics,'' Kennedy said in Boston.
   He said the problems of the strife-torn British province could
be solved if the British government used fair employment practices
and justice and fought discrimination.
   ``We should be electing a president who cares about the people
of Northern Ireland and who will stand up to (Prime Minister) Mrs.
(Margaret) Thatcher,'' he said when asked what Americans can do for
the Northern Irish. He didn't say who his choice for president
would be.
   Kennedy drew loud cheers when he spoke from the steps of the
Wexford Municipal Hall, near his ancestral home in southeast
Ireland, to the several hundred locals who had gathered to see him.
   ``The British have no right to occupy the north of Ireland,''
Kennedy said.
   ``The occupying forces are telling us what to do, what to eat,
who to pray to, how to think.''
   Kennedy, son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy and nephew of
assassinated President John F. Kennedy, drew more cheers when he
said he couldn't visit the land of his roots without exploring the
problems of Northern Ireland.
   ``You wouldn't be satisfied with me if I came here simply as a
tourist,'' he said. ``We all have brothers in the north and they
need our help and support.''
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson objected to Kennedy's views and
said on a British Broadcasting Corp. radio program that withdrawing
British troops would result in further bloodshed.
   ``He should get back to Massachusetts as quickly as possible and
I hope we never set eyes on him again,'' Parkinson said.
   Saturday was the second time in two days that Kennedy had
criticized Britain's role in Northern Ireland, where sectarian
violence has claimed nearly 2,700 lives since 1969.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting a
guerrilla war to oust Britain from the predominantly Protestant
province and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   In Northern Ireland on Friday, Kennedy called on Mrs. Thatcher's
administration ``to change its attitude to the Irish Catholics of
this nation.''
   Kennedy also met Friday with Prime Minister Charles Haughey of
Ireland to discuss how cooperation between the U.S. and Irish
governments could help solve troubles in Northern Ireland.

   Iran and Iraq reported sporadic attacks
and shellings Saturday in their 7{-year-old war, but both appeared
to be observing a tacit cease-fire in their missile attacks in the
``war of the cities.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
Iranian artillery shells hit the battered southern port city of
Basra and four other Iraqi border towns farther north, killing an
undisclosed number of civilians.
   But neither side reported firing or being hit by any long-range
missiles since Friday. The missile duel has taken hundreds of lives
in the past seven weeks.
   A military spokesman in Baghdad said Iraq had ``refrained from
bombarding'' Tehran, the Iranian capital, and other Iranian cities
Friday while Iranians went to the polls to elect a new 270-seat
Majlis, or Parliament.
   But he did not say if the Iraqi restraint would continue until
the results of the election will be known sometime next week.
   In Manama, Bahrain, a Navy spokesman announced that U.S.
warships safely escorted two reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers out of
the Persian Gulf in the 23d such convoy this year.
   The supertanker Middletown and liquefied gas carrier Gas
Princess were escorted on the 550-mile journey from Kuwait to the
southern Strait of Hormuz by the guided missile frigates Samuel B.
Roberts and the John A. Moore.
   The spokesman said the convoy left Kuwait April 5, sailed
through the gulf without incident and passed through the Strait of
Hormuz overnight Saturday.
   Iraq's official news agency quoted the military spokesman as
saying Iraq halted its missile and air attacks on Iranian cities
``to facilitate some people of goodwill to cast their votes in the
election.''
   He said Iraq ``made the decision out of the hope that some good
and responsible people might be elected to the Majlis ... and work
toward ending the war'' in accordance with a United Nations
Security Council cease-fire resolution passed July 20.
   Some small Iranian opposition groups want a truce in the war
that began in September 1980.
   The last Iraqi missile was fired at Iran's holy city of Qom,
south of Tehran, at 6.15 a.m. Friday. Iran retaliated by firing
missiles at Baghdad and other Iraqi cities but then ceased the
attacks.
   Iranian officials have made no comment on Iraq's reports, but
they have said repeatedly Iran was only retaliating for Iraqi
attacks.
   Since the latest spasm in the ``war of the cities'' began Feb.29
when Iraqi warplanes bombed Tehran, the two sides have fired more
than 300 missiles into each other's population centers.
   Iraq reported its helicopter gunships flew 79 combat missions
Saturday against Iranian military positions along the 730-mile
front, but reported no major ground actions.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored
in Nicosia, reported Iranian artillery shelled Iraqi troops in
several sectors, ``inflicting heavy casualties.''

   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III on
Saturday praised Ecuador's efforts to curb the flow of illegal
drugs and then flew to Lima where he met with Peruvian officials
involved in the anti-drug fight.
   After meeting privately with Interior Minister Jose Barsallo,
Meese attended a reception at the Lima residence of U.S. Ambassador
Alexander Watson.
   Meeze met earlier Saturday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, with
Ecuadorean President Leon Fabres Cordero.
   At an airport news conference before departing for Lima, Meese
said drug trafficking has threatened world security.
   ``No country can confront this scourge alone. It requires the
collaboration of all nations,'' said Meese, who is on a week-long
tour of Latin American nations to assess anti-drug trafficking
efforts.
   During his tour he has emphasized his call for a multinational
force to combat global narcotics trafficking, but Latin American
officials have not responded publicly to that suggestion.
   Meese met for more than an hour with Febres Cordero.
   The attorney general is accompanied by John Lawn, head of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Their trip began Wednesday in
the Dominican Republic. Meese arrived in Ecuador Thursday after a
five-hour stop in Colombia.
   He is scheduled to visit a coca-leaf erradication site in Peru's
eastern jungle Sunday. The attorney general is to travel to Bolivia
the following day, where his tour will conclude Wednesday.
   U.S. officials say Ecuador's role in cocaine trafficking is less
significant than that of its Andean neighbors.
   Production of coca leaf, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is on a
minor scale in Ecuador. But in recent years international drug
smugglers have begun using this small nation, wedged between
Colombia and Peru, as a transfer shipping point.
   Peru is the world's largest grower of coca leaf. Most of its
production is partially refined and smuggled into Colombia, where
the drug is turned into pure cocaine for smuggling abroad. Bolivia
is the second biggest grower of coca leaf.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Rights Of Israel and Palestinians Equally Important</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Saturday
that Israel's security and statehood are as important in any Middle
East peace settlement as similar rights for Palestinians.
   Gorbachev made the comments during a meeting with Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, according to the
official Tass news agency.
   According to the Tass account, Gorbachev mentioned Israel's
rights several times during the meeting in the Kremlin.
   It quoted him as saying, ``The Palestinian people has the right
to self-determination in the same measure as it is ensured for the
people of Israel.''
   At another point, Gorbachev said: ``Just as recognition of the
state of Israel and its security interests, the solution of this
question (of Palestinian self-determination) is a necessary element
of the establishment of peace and good neighborliness in the region
on the basis of principles of international law.''
   But before a Middle East peace settlement can be worked out, the
Soviet leader told Arafat Israel must fulfill ``the key
precondition'' of withdrawing from Arab land it occupied in the
1967 Middle East war.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with the Jewish
state in 1967.
   Gorbachev has said the lack of relations is not normal, but
insists Israel must withdraw from the occupied West Bank of the
Jordan River and Gaza Strip before ties can be restored.
   Arafat, who arrived in Moscow on Thursday, has said he will
accept U.N. Security Council resolutions recognizing Israel's right
to exist if Israel and the United States recognize the PLO and
endorse other U.N. measures calling for Israel's withdrawal from
the occupied territories.
   Gorbachev also told Arafat the best way to seek settlement of
the Arab-Israeli conflict is an international conference under the
auspices of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members: the
Soviet Union, United States, Britain, France and China.
   Arafat outlined his view of an international conference to
reporters after his talks with Gorbachev and Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``We are favoring such a conference that would be really
efficient, active and would not be limited by any ceremonial
functions,'' Arafat told a news conference.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, during a five-day tour
of the Middle East last week, pushed the idea of a peace conference
that would prepare for Israeli-Arab negotiations but would exclude
the PLO.
   The conference Gorbachev envisions would be open to ``the most
diverse forms of interaction of its participants'' and would give
the permanent Security Council members the right to ``collectively
or individually table proposals and recommendations,'' according to
Tass.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said he opposes an
international conference under U.N. auspices because he fears the
Soviet Union would tilt the forum in the Arabs' favor and make
demands that would jeoparize Israel's security.

   A jury Saturday found John Zaccaro Jr.
guilty of selling cocaine to an undercover officer two years ago,
rejecting defense arguments that he was entrapped by a pretty state
trooper.
   The jury deliberated for slightly more than two hours before
finding the son of 1984 vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro guilty of selling one-quarter gram of the drug in February
1986, while he was a student at Middlebury College.
   Zaccaro, 24, sat impassively as the verdict was read, his
parents and other family members behind him. He faces up to five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine. A sentencing date was not
immediately set.
   Outside the courthouse, Ferraro read a statement acknowledging
that her son had done wrong in the case.
   But she also criticized Addison County State's Attorney John
Quinn for ``prolonging the agony for two years'' regarding her
son's fate. Ferraro promised to appeal the guilty verdict.
   She said she and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., had tried to set
up a plea agreement shortly after their son was arrested, but Quinn
would not allow a plea bargain that would not include a felony
conviction.
   ``We, as his parents would not allow him to plead guilty'' to a
felony, she said.
   Ferraro said there were several drug cases recently in Vermont
in which plea bargains were easily arranged and light sentences
were given to defendants convicted of selling larger quantities of
drugs.
   In her statement, Ferraro blamed the case on four people: her
son; Quinn; former Middlebury police detective Sgt. David Wemette,
who initiated the investigation after rumors circulated that
Zaccaro had earned the campus nickname of ``the Pharmacist''; and
herself because of the pressure her 1984 candidacy put on her
family.
   Ferraro refused to answer reporters' questions as she and her
family walked to their car and drove off.
   Quinn said the verdict ``sends a message that drug pushers will
not be tolerated in Vermont. In my mind, it's been difficult
dealing with the publicity in the case. I don't care who his
parents are.''
   The state's attorney has an unlisted home telephone number and
could not be reached for further comment on the question of plea
bargaining.
   The verdict came at the end of a six-day trial, more than half
of which was taken up by jury selection.
   Zaccaro's defense attorney, Charles Tetzlaff, presented no
witnesses, but told jurors in closing arguments that they should
find his client innocent by reason of entrapment.
   In his instructions to the Vermont District Court jurors, Judge
Francis McCaffrey said they could find Zaccaro innocent by means of
entrapment if they believed he was induced to commit a crime he
normally would not commit. Entrapment could not be used as a
defense if the jury had considered the lesser charge of possession,
the judge said.
   Tetzlaff said police acted improperly by sending an attractive
female undercover agent to Zaccaro's apartment to buy cocaine. He
asked the jury to send a message to police that society should not
condone such activities.
   Quinn told jurors that the issue was whether Zaccaro sold
cocaine to state trooper Laura Manning.
   ``Yes, she was deceptive. She's not going to the defendant's
house dressed in a uniform. That would be ludicrous,'' Quinn said.
``I can't deny Laura Manning is attractive. I can't deny she's
female. But I can deny she was bait.''
   He described the deal as just another sale for Zaccaro.
   ``When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the
good merchant that he is ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives
it to Manning, Quinn said.
   Earlier Saturday, the final prosecution witness, state police
chemist Frank Durkee, testified that a packet of powder Zaccaro
sold to Manning tested as cocaine.
   Tetzlaff, who rested his case soon after Durkee's testimony, had
said in his opening statement: ``The defense will not dispute the
allegation that he sold a regulated drug. This is a case of
improper and overzealous police conduct.''
   The attorney also said that Manning, an officer on her first
undercover assignment, had brought up the subject of drugs, not
Zaccaro.
   Manning testified Friday that she went to Zaccaro's apartment
with instructions to buy one-quarter gram of cocaine.
   When asked what she said to Zaccaro, Manning responded, ``I
said, `A couple of people told me that you could sell me some
coke.'''
   ``And what did he say?'' Quinn asked.
   ``Sure,'' Manning quoted Zaccaro as responding.
   The judge banned the use of Manning's tape-recorded drug buy as
evidence in the trial. He also refused to allow prosecutors to use
items taken from Zaccaro's car, including documents described as
drug records, $1,630 and eight grams of cocaine. The barring of the
evidence in the car resulted in the dropping of a second charge
against Zaccaro, possession with intent to sell.
   The defense also had raised the argument that Zaccaro was
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his
mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to overturn the
charges on that basis.

   Police renewed an unprecedented 1,000-officer
blitz on street gangs Saturday, redeploying a special task force
that made nearly 600 arrests in an anti-gang dragnet the night
before.
   ``All day long, we have been lifting the hammer,'' said police
spokesman Bill Frio. ``The chief called at 3 p.m. and said to drop
it.''
   The force made 592 arrests during the citywide sweep Friday
night and early Saturday for a variety of felonies and
misdemeanors, and also impounded at least 10 guns and 96 vehicles.
Police said 224 of those arrested were believed to be gang members.
   Police had earlier reported 634 arrests, but later corrected the
figure, which was caused by confusion during booking, Frio said.
Officials were unsure how many of those arrested were held and how
many released on bail, he said.
   The huge show of force began Friday evening with Mayor Tom
Bradley's pledge to ``take back the streets,'' and continued
through the night, with even Police Chief Daryl Gates and an
assistant chief making arrests.
   Gangs were blamed for 205 killings in the city of Los Angeles in
1987. Countywide, the death toll from gang violence last year was
387, many of the victims bystanders caught in the gangs' trademark
``drive-by'' shootings.
   Only one violent gang-related incident was reported in the city
during the sweep Friday night, police said.
   Shots were fired at an officer serving a search warrant at a
house. A special weapons and tactics team was summoned but there
was no further violence, Frio said. Six people were arrested for
investigation of narcotics possession. Cocaine, cash and several
guns were seized.
   In a gang-related incident outside the city, Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputies in nearby Lynwood arrested a young man after a
two-hour standoff that began when he was spotted with a gun, which
he allegedly pointed at a deputy.
   The sweep was the city Police Department's biggest attack ever
on drug dealing and street violence. Over the past month, smaller
task forces have arrested a total of 1,400 suspected gang members,
Frio said.
   The police chief made a collar of his own when he stopped a man
in gang dress, frisked him and discovered a bottle of prescription
drugs in somebody else's name. The man was held for investigation
of possession of a controlled substance, said Lt. Mark Leap.
   Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who was on patrol on the
southside, also made an arrest. His collar was wanted for a parole
violation, Frio said.
   About half the special force went to augment regular patrols in
the south-central area. The rest of the officers spread out in gang
areas throughout the city.
   The task force was assembled by putting officers on overtime at
a cost of $150,000 a day. Bradley has vowed to spend whatever it
takes to intimidate the gangs.
   Drug dealing and gang violence have long been a fact of life in
the poor, minority neighborhoods of south-central Los Angeles.
   But wider community attention _ and political will _ focused on
the violence in February when a woman was shot to death during a
gang confrontation in the affluent, mostly white Westwood
entertainment district near the University of California, Los
Angeles.
   More recently, after a Good Friday attack killed one man and
injured a dozen others, none of them gang members, Gates announced
plans for the new task force.
   Bradley has budgeted funds for 400 new police officers next
year, and political opposition to law-and-order measures aimed at
gangs is virtually non-existent.
   City Councilman Robert Farrell, a longtime southside
representative, said as the task force formed Friday evening that
there was strong support for the police effort and no opposition
over potential civil rights violations.
   ``The expansion of the police force ... is what is necessary to
maintain a sense of order, decency and civility, and the police
deployment is appropriate,'' he said.
   The Police Department's use of a ``suspect profile,''
intelligence work and preliminary planning is ``why you've not
heard anyone raise the issue of civil rights concern,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nixon Says His Biggest Mistake Was Not Bombing North Vietnam
Sooner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon said in an
interview broadcast Saturday that his biggest mistake in office was
in not bombing and mining North Vietnam sooner.
   ``I would say the major mistake I made as president was one,
this will suprise you, was not doing early in 1969 what I did on
May 3 of 1972 and on Dec. 15 of 1972, and that was to bomb and mine
North Vietnam,'' Nixon said in an interview taped for Sunday's
``Meet the Press'' on NBC.
   ``I wanted to do it, I talked to Henry Kissinger about it, but
we were stuck with the bombing halt that we had inherited from the
Johnson administration, with Paris peace talks,'' he said. ``I knew
that, just like the cease fire talks down here in Nicaragua, I
didn't trust them at all. And they proved to be of course phony.
   ``But if we had done that then, I think we would have ended the
war in Vietnam in 1969 rather than in 1973,'' Nixon said in a
segment of the interview shown on NBC News on Saturday. ``That was
my biggest mistake as president.''
   In the hour-long interview, the former president, who resigned
in 1974 when threatened with impeachment for his role in the
Watergate scandal, also discussed presidential pardons, Attorney
General Edwin Meese III and the 1988 presidential candidates, NBC
said.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Train Engineer Had History of Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 42-year-old engineer killed when
two Metro-North Commuter Railroad trains crashed had a history of
railroad driving violations, according to a state official
investigating the accident.
   Raymond C. Hunter, 42, of Stamford, Conn., was killed Wednesday
when a train he was driving rammed into a stopped train in Mount
Vernon.
   The crash, which also injured two Metro-North employees,
occurred when Hunter was driving his empty eight-car train around a
curve and plowed into the back of an empty five-car train stopped
because it was having electrical problems.
   Hunter had ``a history of violations and disciplinary actions,''
Edward Plasburg, chief of Commuter Rail Safety for the state's
Public Transportation Safety Board, said Friday.
   But he and other officials did not say what type of violations
Hunter had been cited for.
   Frank Ghorsi, head of the National Transportation Safety Board's
New York office, said investigators want to know if Hunter's
driving record was unusual.
   Gannett Westchester Newspapers reported Saturday that
Metro-North officials were not willing to release details of
Hunter's driving record.
   The newspaper said that when two Metro-North trains collided in
February 1987, injuring about 35 passengers, records of the crew
members were released the following day.
   Patricia Paley, a Metro-North spokeswoman, said the record is
being guarded more closely this time because the investigation is
more complicated and to protect the dead engineer's privacy.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Soviets Will Join U.S. In Guaranteeing Afghan Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets will join America in guaranteeing a
settlement of the war in Afghanista, Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
quoted Saturday as saying, and he hinted a dispute over superpower
aid to rival factions has been resolved.
   The aid issue has been a key obstacle in the negotiations in
Geneva on a settlement of the war and the withdrawal of an
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez announced Friday that agreements
were ready to be signed and U.S. sources said the signing would
take place Thursday.
   In a speech he gave in the republic of Uzbekistan on Friday but
not released until Saturday, Gorbachev did not directly refer to
the dispute over whether the Soviet Union would stop military aid
to Afghanistan's Marxist government and the United States would end
its support of Afghan rebels.
   But the Soviet leader said the Communist Party Politburo had
found ``a way (so) that the signings of the agreements by the
Afghan and Pakistani sides and the simultaneous signing of certain
documents by us and the Americans in the capacity of guarantors
could take place.''
   U.S. officials said Saturday in Washington they received a
written Soviet response to a Reagan administration proposal for the
two superpowers to continue military support of Afghan factions
after the Soviet withdrawal.
   No details were released, but the Soviets last week were
reported to have informally accepted the U.S. proposal. U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz was studying the Soviet
response and was considering a trip to Geneva to attend the signing
of the accord aimed ending Soviet invovlement in Afghanistan, U.S.
officials said.
   In his speech, Gorbachev also repeated the statement that Soviet
troops would begin withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15. He gave
the speech in the Communist Party Central Committee's chambers in
the Central Asian republic's capital of Tashkent.
   Gorbachev and Afghan leader Najib met in Tashkent on Thursday
and released a joint statement saying all obstacles to a war
settlement and Soviet troop withdrawal had been removed.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help the government battle anti-communiust insurgents.
   Tass, the official news agency, released a text of Gorbachev's
remarks and the evening television news program Vremya broadcast
the 55-minute speech as its lead item on Saturday. Some excerpts of
the speech, which focused mainly on domestic economic issues, were
released Friday.
   Gorbachev said last-minute problems developed during the Geneva
talks.
   ``Difficulties threatening to torpedo the agreements arose at
the concluding stage,'' he said. ``This required additional
intensive efforts.'' He said the Politburo met and ``found
approaches which, as we think, provide now a possibility to
conclude this process.''
   He did not specify the difficulties, but appeared to be
referring to U.S. demands for ``symmetry'' in the cutoff of
superpower military aid.
   Shultz had proposed ending all U.S. and Soviet aid to the two
sides, but the Soviets rejected that saying their aid to
Afghanistan is a bilateral matter not subject to international
consideration. Shultz then offered the compromise, calling for
symmetrical levels of aid.
   It is not known what role the United States and Soviet Union
would play in guaranteeing the Geneva accords because texts the
agreements have not been released.

<DATELINE>HILLSBORO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A housekeeper who was afraid of
water and couldn't swim died after plunging into the ocean to try
to save a toddler whose grandparents had employed her for more than
20 years, officials and family members said.
   Kamilia M. Hassan, 46, helped raise the mother of 23-month-old
Daniel Kemper Smith Jr. She and the boy died after he bolted into
the ocean from a back yard that abuts the beach and she went in
after him.
   A passer-by spotted them in the ocean Thursday evening, and
visiting medical students tried to resuscitate them. But the child
died Thursday night at North Broward Medical Center, and Ms. Hassan
died there Friday morning.
   ``She couldn't swim, she knew that,'' said Jack Davis, the
child's great-uncle. ``She was really sacrificing herself.''
   Ms. Hassan, a Syrian native, had no relatives in the United
States, Davis said.
   The boy's mother, JoAnn Smith of Boca Raton, whom Ms. Hassan had
helped raise, was visiting her parents' beachfront home Thursday
when the incident occurred.
   The toddler apparently ran into the water, and Ms. Hassan
followed, panicking in the seas of 2 to 3 feet, said Hillsboro
Beach Police Chief Ralph Dunn. Officials don't know how long the
two were in the water before they were spotted.
   Both received first aid on the beach from three medical students
who had just arrived on a spring break holiday from the University
of Osteopathic Medicine and Health Sciences in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Joe Rowane said he and his fellow students, John Pargulski and
Gehred Wetzel, all 24, had been on the beach only a few minutes
when they were enlisted to try to save the woman and child. Neither
one had a pulse when pulled from the water, Rowane said.
   Funeral services for Daniel were held Saturday in Boca Raton.
Ms. Hassan's funeral was set for Sunday afternoon.

Movie</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gang Violence, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guardian Angels picketed actor Sean
Penn's mansion Saturday to denounce his latest movie as a
``recruitment film'' for street gangs, but Penn and his wife, pop
star Madonna, were reportedly out of town.
   The anti-crime group, wearing their trademark red berets and
carrying signs and mock coffins, marched outside the gates of
Penn's mansion in this seaside celebrity enclave, demanding an end
to local screenings of the film ``Colors.''
   The demonstrators chanted, ``Profit from the movie `Colors' will
not profit the crying mothers.'' A toilet seat adorned with Penn's
photo was set up outside the gates.
   The movie ``pumps (gang members) up; it's better than what a
professional coach does,'' said Paul Barrera, the Angels' regional
coodinator. ``If I was a 14-, 15-year-old kid, I would say, `Wow, I
want to go out and join.'''
   Barrera claimed that up to 50 people took part in the
demonstration, but Malibu sheriff's Sgt. Bill Hutton put the number
at closer to a dozen.
   The picketing, which was peaceful, lasted about three hours,
Hutton said.
   ``The Penns are out of state,'' Hutton said. ``It's possibly
nothing more than a media event for the Guardian Angels.''
   The group planned to picket the home of director Dennis Hopper
on Sunday.
   The Guardian Angels are the latest group to criticize the movie,
which stars Penn and Robert Duvall as tough cops battling gangs on
the streets of Los Angeles.
   Although Los Angeles police acted as technical advisers on the
film, several law-enforcement officials who attended a pre-release
screening last month denounced the final product.
   They, like the Angels, said it glorifies gangs, which were
blamed for nearly 400 killings last year in Los Angeles County, and
were the target of massive police sweeps this weekend.
   ``It's a recruitment film,'' Barrera said. ``It never once
showed these guys for what they were, parasites on our community.''

<TEXT>
   Candidate Sonny Bono isn't sure how
he'll do in this desert resort's mayoral election Tuesday, but just
ask him about his ex-wife's chances for an Oscar.
   ``I had this vision,'' Bono said. ``This incredible thought
occurred to me. `Cher's going to win the Academy Award.' I called
her yesterday. I said, `Cher, you're going to win.'
   ``She said, `From your mouth to God's ear.'''
   Cher is a nominee for Best Actress in Monday night's Academy
Awards for her performance in ``Moonstruck.'' And her former
singing and marriage partner is on the ballot for mayor the next
day in this celebrity desert resort.
   ``Wouldn't it be fun if she won the Academy Award and I was
elected mayor?'' Bono said in a recent interview at his lavish
mansion here. `It would be unprecedented in that Sonny and Cher
stays alive in so many ways, years later.''
   It's been 23 years since the bell-bottomed, fur-vested couple
hit the top of the record charts singing ``I've Got You Babe,'' and
14 years since both their television show and marriage ended.
   Bono, who recently appeared in offbeat movie ``Hairspray'' and
also runs a restaurant, announced his candidacy a year ago, drawing
hoots and howls from people who remembered him as the long-haired
butt of Cher's jokes and whose career bottomed out after guest
spots on ``Love Boat'' and ``Fantasy Island.''
   ``They thought it was a joke,'' Bono said of townspeople's
reaction to his candidacy. ``They came around because I put my body
out there for people to start shooting at. And people came around.
They now take me very seriously.''
   Show business, he says, was never as tough as running for
office. ``Not even close!''
   The pressure and anxiety reached major proportions March 31 when
he burst into a televised candidates' forum and exploded at the
moderator for not explaining that he wasn't participating because
his pregnant fourth wife, Mary, 26, was hospitalized with the flu.
The couple's first child is due April 17.
   ``I shouldn't have gotten that emotional or let it affect me
that much. But it did,'' he said apologetically.
   Although there are seven candidates for mayor, the media
spotlight is on Bono.
   ``We got calls from Europe, an Australian television station.
ABC is coming in tomorrow. It's just crazy,'' said campaign worker
Glenn Symonds.
   Bono is fueling his campaign by selling $15 ``Sonny Bono for
Mayor'' T-shirts. The sales of shirts, buttons and bumper stickers
account for $37,000 of his $53,000 campaign war chest, the largest
of the candidates.
   Bono's opponents are Vice Mayor Eli Birer, businesswoman Deyna
Hodges, accountant Lloyd Maryanov, Agua Caliente Indian Tribe
Secretary Ray Patencio, real estate agent Neil Beatty and retired
dentist Lewis Friedman.
   ``I've never run against a celebrity before. It's really
tough,'' Birer said.
   Bono moved to the desert four years ago to escape Los Angeles.
The tranquility relaxed him, and he enjoyed the small-town
atmosphere.
   But he soon had run-ins with city officials over the size of a
sign for his Italian restaurant, ``Bono,'' and about a retaining
wall he was building at his home. So, like Carmel's Clint Eastwood,
he decided to run for mayor.
   ``It was very dictatorial, very controlled, very hostile,'' Bono
said of the city government. ``I have a big investment in this
city. I don't want to see it deteriorate or decline.''
   Incumbent Frank Bogert, 76, is stepping down after two two-year
terms. The new mayor will serve a four-year term and be paid
$15,000 a year. The part-time, non-partisan official presides over
the City Council, while a city manager handles daily operations and
makes recommendations to the council.
   Whatever townspeople think of Bono's candidacy, most agree that
Palm Springs needs revitalization. It has lost business, clout and
tourists to other nearby desert communities such as Palm Desert and
Rancho Mirage, where Frank Sinatra lives.
   If he's elected, Bono has plans to draw tourists to this town
120 miles southeast of Los Angeles, including a film festival with
big-name celebrities, a sporting event such as a marathon or
triathalon and concerts.
   But win or lose, Bono knows he made a difference by getting the
issues discussed and people interested. An election in this
community of 38,000 residents usually draws about 6,000 of its
18,000 registered voters. That's expected to double Tuesday.
   ``At least I added excitement to the race,'' he said. ``It would
have been a yawn without me.''

   A tentative settlement was reached Saturday in a
strike by actors and actresses in radio and television commercials,
a union official said.
   Members of the American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists and the Screen Actors Guild went on strike against
producers of TV and radio commercials March 21. The chief issue
dividing the two sides had been their pay for ads appearing on
cable television.
   The tentative settlement reached at negotiations in New York is
subject to approval by the unions' board of directors, who will
meet in Los Angeles on Tuesday and Thursday, said Dick Moore,
spokesman for the unions.
   The strike against the Joint Policy Committee of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National
Advertisers affected all recorded commercials in English or Spanish
on radio and television.
   The unions have 100,000 members nationwide.
   Terms of the tentative pact would not be released unless the
contract is approved by the board of directors, he said.
   The unions have allowed some commercials to be made during the
strike by advertisers _ including presidential candidates _ who
were willing to meet the unions' demands, he said.
   About 400 companies agreed to make commercials under the interim
arrangement, Moore said.
   He said the strike has forced many commercials to be repeated
more often than they otherwise would have been and has forced the
use of ``a lot of old stuff.''

   The National Institutes of Health and two
congressional panels are about to launch investigations into
charges that a molecular biology manuscript written by a Nobel
laureate and his colleagues misrepresented research data.
   An official at the NIH said a special committee has been named
to review allegations of scientific misconduct involving a study on
duplicating immunity cells in laboratory mice. The project was
headed by Nobel laureate David Baltimore, director of the Whitehead
Institute in Boston, and Theresa Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University.
Four other researchers were co-authors.
   Mary Miers, an executive in the NIH office that investigates
allegations of research misconduct, said the special committee was
organized after two NIH scientists, Walter W. Stewart and Ned
Feder, ``raised issues'' about research performed by Imanishi-Kari.
   Miers said Stewart and Feder reported their allegations in a
manuscript that has been provided to the committee. The two men,
who in the past have raised questions about the credibility of
other research efforts, declined to discuss the case with a
reporter.
   Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research in
cellular biology, said in an interview on Friday that he welcomed
the NIH investigation and hopes it will silence the charges of
Stewart and Feder who he said have ``acted like a judge and jury''
in the case.
   Testimony on the controversy will be heard by two separate
congressional subcommittees, both of which have called Stewart and
Feder as witnesses.
   On Monday, the House subcommittee on government operations and
human resources will hear the NIH scientists, along with other
witnesses on the general subject of scientific fraud.
   On Tuesday, the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigation will plow some of the same ground. Feder and Stewart
will again testify, along with a researcher, Margot O'Toole, who
assisted Imanishi-Kari in the controversial study.
   The study co-authored by Baltimore, Imanishi-Kari and four other
researchers was published in the prestigious journal ``Cell'' on
April 25, 1986. The paper, titled ``Altered Repertoire of
Endogenous Immunoglobulin Gene Expression in Transgenic Mice
Containing a Rearranged Mu Heavy Chain Gene,'' deals with the
replication of immunity cells in a type of genetically altered
laboratory mice.
   Baltimore said he performed the molecular biology work that
contributed to half of the paper, and that Imanishi-Kari conducted
the research that dealt with the immune system.
   The allegations of misconduct, he said, stem from a ``difference
in interpretation'' of research conducted in the laboratory of
Imanishi-Kari, who then was at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   He said O'Toole, who was a post-doctoral student assisting in
the research, disagreed with an interpretation by Imanishi-Kari of
how a monoclonal antibody attached itself to types of immune cells.
   O'Toole brought charges of misconduct against Imanishi-Kari, but
her allegations were investigated and dismissed by officials at MIT
and at Tufts.
   ``The subject was dropped until somebody got Stewart and Feder
interested in the case,'' said Baltimore.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked a
village Saturday in the province of Usulutan, killing 10 government
soldiers and injuring 20 others, military and civilian officials
said.
   The officials said members of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, an alliance of five rebel armies, attacked
government positions in Villa El Triunfo, 74 miles east of the
capital of San Salvador.
   The officials of the Sixth Infantry Brigade of Usulutan and
civilians in that region, all of whom demanded anonymity for
security reasons, said the rebels attacked the village early
Saturday.
   They destroyed two army tanks, set fire to the offices of a
state-run communications company and damaged four private houses,
the officials reported.
   The Armed Forces press office, meanwhile, reported that
government troops killed 20 rebels and injured 13 others in the
first week of April. Three soldiers died and 13 were wounded in the
fighting, it said.
   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed government
since 1979. The civil war has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives.

   Police ended a 15-hour sit-in at Penn
State University on Saturday by arresting students who said the use
of force typified the school's insensitivity toward blacks.
   ``We were dragged out and we got pulled out by the state
troopers. ... People were manhandled by the state troopers,'' said
Darryl King, a senior from Philadelphia and a student leader of the
almost entirely black group occupying the school's
telecommunications building.
   ``I think it's a terrible message to send to students when the
president of the university would rather send state troopers to
meet with them than come himself,'' said Seth Williams, president
of Penn State's student government and one of those arrested.
   More than 150 students began the protest Friday afternoon after
student leaders and school administrators failed to agree on ground
rules for a discussion of minority issues with university President
Bryce Jordan and top administration officials.
   Black students said they wanted to outline grievances on
minority issues at an open meeting with Jordan.
   After the sit-in began university officials read students a
preliminary injunction ordering them to leave the
telecommunications building at 8 p.m. and again at 10 p.m., but
negotiations continued until 2 a.m.
   At least 75 university, local and state police began arresting
students at 5:25 a.m., said David Stormer, director of university
safety. Ninety-one protesters were arrested on charges of
trespassing in the building or being disorderly outside, Stormer
said.
   ``This is symbolic of the way they treat us here at Penn
State,'' said King, a former president of the Black Caucus, a
student organization.
   Robert Blair, a spokesman for the Black Caucus, said minority
students should have a voice in programs at the university that
affect them and criticized Penn State for failing to meet a
court-mandated goal for black enrollment.
   Jordan issued a statement Saturday night in which he called the
arrests ``an unhappy day for Penn State.''
   ``We are anxious to re-establish communications with the
students involved,'' he said. ``We wish to discuss their concerns
under mutually agreeable conditions, so that the university's
affirmative action program can move forward with the support of the
entire Penn State community.''
   Last fall, Penn State failed to reach the 5 percent black
enrollment it agreed to meet under court order. Penn State has a
3.6 percent black enrollment, or 2,424 black students out of about
67,000.
   Jordan agreed to a meeting Tuesday after a group of nine black
students and a local black pastor staged an 11-hour sit-in outside
his office. The university president sent two senior administrators
Friday to speak privately with the students.
   But student leaders said they wanted an open meeting with Jordan
and 12 administrators and faculty.
   Carol Cartwright, chairman of the university's Equal Opportunity
Planning Committee, said the administration wanted to meet the
student leaders somewhere else to set up a public meeting for their
grievances.
   Stormer said he waited until dawn to make the arrests, in part
to ensure a smaller crowd outside the two-story, brick building. As
many as 200 students had gathered to show their support, but their
numbers had dwindled to about 30 when police started making arrests.
   State troopers, dressed in riot gear, formed lines on either
side of the building while officers inside arrested protesters
one-by-one.
   Students, many holding yellow citation slips, were released
almost immediately and walked through police lines to be greeted by
hugs from friends and cheers from supporters.
   Carol Herrmann, executive assistant to the president, said the
administration had no choice but to arrest the students when hours
of negotiations failed to get them to leave the building.
   ``I hope it won't alienate the black community. I think that the
administration is ready always to address concerns of (campus)
environment,'' she said.
   ``I think it went very smoothly,'' Stormer said. ``There was no
resistance in the form of being combative. They merely resisted in
the form of holding onto each other.''
   About 130 protesters were in the building when police started
making arrests, but many chose to leave rather than face
prosecution, Stormer said.
   Craig Millar, assistant vice president for student services,
told the students who were arrested they also face charges under
the university's code of conduct and could be expelled.
   Operations at the telecommunications building, which houses the
university's central switchboard, were not interrupted by the
student protest, university spokesman Roger Williams said.

   A toothless inmate who escaped in
Minnesota while being escorted to a hospital to pick up his
dentures was captured Saturday by police and federal authorities in
his hometown of Columbus.
   Edward Lee Dugan, 34, who has federal convictions for mail fraud
and narcotics violations, was arrested without incident at an
apartment complex where his sister lives, U.S. Marshal Bob Obenour
said.
   Dugan had been held at the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center
in St. Paul, Minn., since March 22 and was being escorted to a
medical center when a gunman confronted the deputy escorting him
and ordered him to free Dugan.
   Dugan, who was a native of Columbus and had been a construction
worker, was handcuffed as he fled the hospital where his dentures
had been repaired. He left without picking up his dentures, but he
was wearing dentures when arrested Saturday, authorities said.
   No one was injured in the escape. The gunman who assisted in the
escape has not been identified.
   Dugan was originally convicted of mail fraud and was sentenced
to seven years at a federal correctional center in Rochester,
Minn., a federal prosecutor in Minneapolis said.
   Later, he pleaded guilty to smuggling marijuana into the prison
and received an eight-month consecutive sentence, federal officials
said.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers rammed
bulldozers into shops, uprooted plum trees and smashed the windows
of a mosque during a rampage in this West Bank village, residents
said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, an army report quoted by television suggested that a
15-year-old Israeli girl killed during a clash last week with Arabs
on the West Bank was shot by a Jewish settler who panicked during
the confrontation.
   During a tour of Beit Ummar, this Associated Press reporter saw
dozens of metal store gates smashed and dented. One gate lay
twisted over the glass counters of a pharmacy where two old men
sat, surrounded by glass shards. The outside wall of a school was
torn down and uprooted trees lined the main road.
   An army official said the matter was under investigation. A
preliminary probe showed that villagers blocked roads with stones
and garbage containers after a violent protest Friday, the army
said.
   ``In the process of clearing the roads, damage was caused to
stairs, shops and cars that were parked along the road,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Violent clashes between Palestinians and soldiers were reported
throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Saturday. In the
West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers shot and wounded nine Arabs,
hospital officials said. Three Arabs were wounded in Gaza.
   The army said it could not immediately confirm the reports.
   An army report on the the death Wednesday of Tirza Porat
indicated that a Jewish settler inadvertently shot the 15-year-old
girl during a clash with Arab protesters near Beita, 10 miles south
of the West Bank town of Nablus, according to Israel television.
   Two Arabs also were killed in the fighting and 15 people were
injured. The girl was one of 16 Israeli teen-agers on a hike
accompanied by two armed Jewish settlers.
   Israeli television, quoting an army report, said that one of the
settlers, Romam Al Dubi, opened fire twice with his M-16 rifle,
killing a Beita resident. It said the group then walked toward the
village.
   Mosque loudspeakers in Beita alerted residents that a villager
had been killed and called on them to defend Beita against armed
settlers, the televison said.
   In the village, the mother and sister of the slain Arab struck
Al Dubi from behind with a large board, Israel television quoted
the army report as saying.
   The television account said Al Dubi panicked and apparently
fired his automatic rifle in all directions, killing another Arab.
   It said Miss Porat was struck by a bullet from Al Dubi's M-16,
according to the army report that is set to be submitted to the
Cabinet Sunday.
   Army officials previously said the girl was stoned to death by
Arabs during the clash, then said she had been struck both by a
bullet and a rock.
   Since Palestinians began violent protests against Israeli rule
in the territories in early December, 141 Arabs, one Israeli
soldier and one Israeli civilian have been killed. The army has
arrested hundreds of Arabs in a crackdown on the areas occupied by
Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
   In Jerusalem, scores of left- and right-wing demonstrators
protested in front of the home of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Police intervened when members of three rival groups engaged in a
brief scuffle, Israel television said.
   Right-wing Jewish settlers have been staging a vigil at the site
since Miss Porat, the child of settlers, was killed Wednesday. The
settlers demand more settlements in the occupied territories and
harsher army measures against Arab protesters.
   They were joined Saturday by dozens of followers of U.S.-born
Rabbi Meir Kahane, who heads the anti-Arab Kach movement, and by
left-wing protesters chanting ``Occupation no, peace yes''
   After Friday's clash in Beit Ummar, about 13 miles south of
Jerusalem, the army closed the village to reporters.
   A Beit Ummar resident said the trouble started when dozens of
youths burned tires and threw stones at soldiers after Moslem noon
prayers Friday.
   In response, soldiers brought in two bulldozers and wreaked
havoc in the village for five hours, said the resident, who would
only give his first name, Mohammed, for fear of retaliation.
   ``They just wanted to punish us,'' said Mohammed, 21.
   He said each bulldozer was surrounded by about 50 soldiers who
pointed their submachine guns and raised riot sticks to keep away
screaming villagers.
   Mohammed pointed to the village mosque and said soldiers had
smashed its windows with their boots and sticks. The army's policy
is that soldiers should not enter mosques.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, hundreds of Arabs took
to the streets Saturday, burning tires and shouting anti-Israeli
slogans. Hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded nine
Arabs.
   Violent protests also broke out in the Gaza Strip. Hospital
officials said an 18-year-old Arab was wounded in the chest during
clashes in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
   The hospital officials said soldiers firing rubber bullets in
the camp also hit a 60-year-old Arab man below the left eye and a
50-year-old woman in the stomach.
   In Gaza City, Arabs hoisted a Palestinian flag, outlawed by
Israel, on the city's main mosque. Soldiers fired tear gas and live
ammunition at youths who burned tires in the main roads.

   Adrienne Lois Brown, estranged wife of soul
singer James Brown who accused her husband last week of trying to
kill her, was herself arrested Saturday and charged with possession
of a hallucinogenic drug, police said.
   Officer D.R. Brown of the Augusta Police Department said his
department had received information that Mrs. Brown was going to
receive a shipment of PCP from New York at Bush Field airport,
according to police reports.
   Brown and Detective T.C. Walker approached Mrs. Brown and
another woman, Ranell T. Wright, at the airport and confiscated
nasal spray bottles full of ``a brown, leafy substance'' mixed with
PCP, according to police reports.
   A cigarette Mrs. Brown apparently tried to hide from the police
also tested positive for PCP, police reports said.
   Last week Mrs. Brown, who has filed for divorce, accused her
husband of trying to kill her, and Brown was charged with assault
with intent to murder and aggravated assault and battery for the
incidents at Brown's Beech Island, S.C., home. She accused him of
beating her with a pipe and firing a gun at the car she was in.
   He turned himself in to Aiken County, S.C., authorities and was
released on Tuesday on $15,000 bond. He denied attacking her.
   Brown, who won a Grammy last year for ``Living in America,''
later left for a concert tour in Brazil.
   Mrs. Brown, 38, and Ms. Wright, 25, of New York each charged
with one felony count of possession of PCP. They were later
released on $1,550 cash bond apiece.

   Young ballerinas performed a Russian welcome
dance Saturday as residents of a Chicago suburb greeted four Soviet
guests who are visiting Oak Park in search of ``middle America.''
   ``Because of the special responsibility of our two nations,
because of our nuclear arsenals, citizen diplomacy must work hard
and assure the peace,'' said Irina Malikova, a political science
professor at Moscow State University.
   Ms. Malikova and three compatriots arrived in the United States
as part of a program called ``Soviets, Meet Middle America,''
sponsored by the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Initiatives, a San Francisco-based
organization.
   They are among 400 Soviets touring 240 cities in the year-long
program.
   Another Soviet group wrapped up a four-day stay in Tampa, Fla.,
Saturday and headed for the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The group also
plans to visit Mill Valley, Calif., and San Francisco during its
two-week trip before returning to the Soviet Union.
   Their American hosts took them on a tour of the city, a cruise
of Tampa Bay, to schools and universities, a day care center,
hospitals and shopping. At night they invited friends over to meet
and talk with them.
   Sponsors on both sides credit the new policy of openness under
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for allowing the plan that they say
would have been taboo five years ago.
   In Illinois, the Soviet visitors were welcomed by the Oak Park
Civic Ballet. Four children dressed in red satin skirts gave them
flowers and performed a special dance.
   Activities planned for the Soviets' four-day stay include
touring the home and studio of the late architect Frank Lloyd
Wright and seeing the Chicago Peace Museum, said Pat Andrews, a
village board member coordinating the visit.
   She said the visit is an attempt to help Americans and Soviets
``get to know each other, not just as newspaper headlines or `us
vs. them,' but one-to-one, people-to-people.''
   Ms. Malikova said she plans to share her impressions of the
United States with students and community groups when she returns
to Moscow.
   ``I'm assured that the Americans and the Soviets are so alike,''
she said in a telephone interview from the home of Virginia Cassin,
her Oak Park host. ``They have the same problems and the same
wishes and the same way of thinking.''

<HEAD>Singer of `Rainy Nights in Georgia' Dies at 56</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brook Benton, whose smooth baritone produced a
string of hits in the late 1950s and 1960s as well as the 1970 hit
``Rainy Night in Georgia,'' died Saturday, a hospital official
said. He was 56.
   Benton, who lived in Queens, died at Mary Immaculate Hospital in
Queens, according to the hospital administrator, who identified
herself only as Mrs. Munson. She said the family had asked that no
further information be released.
   Benton, who started out as a gospel singer, was known for
ballads set against lush orchestral arrangements. One of his
biggest years was 1959, when he had four top 20 hits: ``It's Just a
Matter of Time,'' `So Many Ways,'' ``Endlessly'' and ``Thank You
Pretty Baby.''
   Among his later hits were ``The Boll Weevil Song,'' ``Think
Twice,'' ``Revenge,'' ``Frankie and Johnny'' and ``For My Baby.''
   In 1960, he recorded several duets with Dinah Washington, the
most popular of which were ``Baby (You've Got What it Takes)'' and
``A Rockin' Good Way.''
   ``Rainy Night in Georgia,'' a sentimental tune that took full
advantage of his sometimes mournful croon, reached No. 4 on the
Billboard pop chart.
   ``It was Benton's own idea to combine gospel intensity with lush
pop arrangements,'' according to the ``Rolling Stone Record
Guide,'' which described his singing as ``smooth and smoky.''
   ``From rock to ballads to blues, Benton never drops his easy
elegance, yet the swirling strings don't obscure his emotional
intensity,'' said the record guide.

   A district court on Saturday placed
under arrest a former police sergeant for alleged complicity in a
sex-abuse case involving a female dissident.
   Moon Kwi-dong was imprisoned in response to lawyers's demands
for his retrial in the complaint of a student from the state-run
Seoul National University who claimed she was sexually abused after
being arrestd in the summer of 1986.
   Court officials said Moon's retrial is expected to open next
month in Inchon, a port city west of Seoul.
   Moon had been charged in the initial trial with abusing Kwon
In-sook, 26, while she was being interrogated about anti-government
activities.
   But prosecutors dismissed the case, saying it was ``typical
false propaganda by ideolgically motivated dissidents.''
   Although the criminal prosecution against Moon was dropped, it
was suggested he leave the police force to accept moral
responsibility and he resigned.
   But the Supreme Court, acting on an appeal by Ms. Kwon, ruled in
February there was sufficient basis to her claim and ordered a
retrial.

   Two children were strangled and a third
survived a similar attack in a home in northeast Washington on
Saturday afternoon, police said.
   Kristina Caine, 8, and her brother, Eric Hill Jr., 3, were
pronounced dead on the scene by the medical examiner while their
sister, 2-year-old Jennifer Hill, was taken to Children's Hospital
where she was listed in good condition, said police Capt. William
White.
   The children were found by their father when he returned home
from work about 2:15 p.m., White said, adding that the location of
the children's mother was not known.
   Police declared the mother, Padrica Hill, 27, a missing person
and said they had made finding her a top priority.
   No charges were filed in the case as of late Saturday, police
said.
   The father, Eric Hill, ran into a market near his home and
yelled, ``My kids are dead. Please help me!'' said Earl Washington,
the owner of the market.
   Washington said that when he and Hill returned to the home, they
found the son dead on the living room couch with a clothesline
around his neck.
   ``We then went upstairs to one of the bedrooms and found the
baby, the youngest child in the bed, safe, but she appeared to have
a rope mark around her neck,'' Washington said.
   The third child was found dead in the basement by paramedics and
the elder Hill.
   Eric Hill works as a teller at Citizens Bank & Trust Co., and
neighbors said Mrs. Hill recently had been hired by a Peoples Drug
Store.

<HEAD>No More Bodies Found in El Paso Desert Search</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 volunteers searched a
stretch of desert Saturday where the bodies of six young women have
been found buried in shallow graves since September.
   The search _ which officials may try to repeat next weekend _
did not turn up any more bodies in the area, about 18 miles
northeast of El Paso.
   Volunteers carrying shovels and pitchforks included soldiers,
jail guards, police officers, sheriff's deputies and reserves, fire
marshals, chaplains and an El Paso city councilman.
   Deputy Police Chief Gus Massey said although no bodies were
found, ``We may go back and do it over and over again.''
   Saturday's desert scouring was prompted by the discovery of the
sixth set of skeletal remains by aluminum can collectors March 14,
about two months after authorities had halted searches.
   All of the remains have been of young women, and police believe
that three missing young women may also be victims of what they
have labeled a serial killing.
   ``I'm sure it's a comfort to them (the families of the missing)
to know we're making an extra effort,'' Officer George Salas said
as he took a break from digging to rest in the shade of a National
Guard truck.
   The trucks and three school buses on loan from the El Paso
school district transported the workers to the dig site from the
National Guard Armory, where they met for a 6:45 a.m. briefing.
   Searchers divided into 10 teams and covered specific areas of
the desert.
   El Paso County sheriff's deputy Jack Waite said searchers took
into consideration that the bodies have been found in shallow
graves within 30 feet from dirt trails.
   ``We spread out a few feet apart and we just followed the
roadways,'' he said.
   Lt. J.R. Grijalva said the search has not assured officials that
there are no more bodies in the desert. He said authorities will
determine later this week whether they will search again next
weekend.

Keating's father regarding son's membership in all-white country

<TEXT>
   Francis A. Keating, like the other top deputy
just named by Attorney General Edwin Meese III, belongs to an
all-white country club, raising the prospect that both of the new
Justice Department officials could face confirmation difficulties.
   Keating, now assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement and
tapped for the No. 3 job at Justice, listed a stock share in the
Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., on his 1987 financial
disclosure form. A club official, who did not want to give his
name, confirmed that Keating is still a member of the club.
   Keating's father, Anthony F. Keating, contended Saturday that
his son was no longer a member of Southern Hills Country Club,
according to the Sunday editions of Tulsa World.
   ``He doesn't belong anymore,'' the father told the newspaper.
``He used to be a member, but gave it up when he went to
Washington.''
   Keating was confirmed to his Treasury job in 1985, two years
before completing the disclosure form that still listed the stock
share in the country club.
   It was reported last week that John Shepherd, named by Meese to
fill the job of deputy attorney general _ the No. 2 post in the
department _ is a member of the all-white Bellerive Country Club
and the all-male Missouri Athletic Club in the St. Louis area.
   Keating and Shepherd have yet to be formally nominated by
President Reagan and still face confirmation hearings by the
Senate. Keating would succeed Associate Attorney General Stephen
Trott, who is leaving to become a federal appellate judge in
California.
   The president of Southern Hills, Thomas J. Hughes, said that
although he is ``not steeped in the tradition'' of the club, ``to
my knowledge, there never has been a black member.''
   Hughes said a person becomes a member of the club by being
sponsored by a current member. He said he could not disclose the
club's initiation fee. Keating valued his membership stock as worth
between $5,001 and $15,000 in his financial disclosure form.
   Keating also was once a member of another all-white club in
Tulsa, the Tulsa Club.
   But Charles Adams, office manager for the Tulsa Club, said
Keating ``resigned his membership when he left town.''
   Keating, 44, was out of the country on a business trip and could
not be reached for comment. Terry Eastland, a Justice Department
spokesman, declined comment.
   Shepherd, a former president of the American Bar Association,
was named by Meese last Tuesday to fill the deputy attorney
general's job following the sudden resignation March 29 of Arnold
Burns.
   Burns quit along with Assistant Attorney General William Weld
because of their apparent concern about the 11-month criminal
investigation of Meese.
   As head of enforcement at Treasury, Keating oversees the Secret
Service, the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   The issue of federal appointees' membership in exclusionary
clubs has arisen before, with mixed results. President Carter's
nominee for attorney general, Griffin Bell, told the Judiciary
Committee during his confirmation hearings he would resign from
such clubs. President Reagan's first attorney general, William
French Smith, refused to follow that example and was confirmed
anyway.
   More recently, U.S. Circuit Judge Anthony Kennedy resigned from
membership in two exclusionary clubs when his name was first
mentioned as a possible nominee for the Supreme Court. He was
subsequently confirmed as a justice.

   Liberace's fans came by the hundreds and bid
generously as thousands of items from the late pianist's five
lavish homes went on the auction block Saturday.
   Bidding for one of the flamboyant entertainer's Baldwin grand
pianos, almost entirely encrusted with mirrored squares, reached
$42,500; the total price paid by a London dealer, including a 10
percent premium over the bid, was $46,750.
   ``Bidding is way, way, way over our estimates,'' said Bernard
Osher, president of Butterfield & Butterfield auction house, as the
four-day auction of 2,365 items got under way at the Los Angeles
Convention Center.
   More than 800 bidders were on hand when the action began at 11
a.m. with Liberace's jewelry. Thirty-one lots of jewelry owned by
the glittery pianist were gone in a blaze of bids.
   Total transactions for the day reached $660,045, more than the
$525,650 auctioneers believed would come in.
   Arnold and Leslie Duke of Washington, D.C., bought the first
item, a pendant depicting Liberace's profile in sculpted silver
against a blue lapis lazuli background.
   It had been estimated to sell between $10 to $100. The Dukes,
who own a gem and jewelry show that tours the country, bought it
with a $3,500 bid. Including the 10 percent auctioneer's
percentage, they paid $3,850 for the pendant.
   The pendant was one of 10 jewelry lots they purchased to display
in their show, which also features items from such celebrities as
John Lennon and Cher.
   ``He was a master showman,'' Duke said. ``Not only were we fans,
but there was nobody else like him.''
   A personalized 14-karat gold cigarette case decorated with
diamonds, estimated to sell for between $3,000 to $5,000, was
bought for $8,800, including the 10 percent premium.
   ``We had hoped for a crowd this size, but we never really
believed it would happen,'' said Hillary Holland, vice president of
Christie's, the international auction house that organized the sale
with Butterfield & Butterfield.
   ``This is the most fun, festive feeling we've ever had at an
auction,'' Ms. Holland said.
   While many bidders were purchasing items as investments, others
were fans who had come to pay their respects to Liberace, who died
Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS. He was 67.
   Phylis Carroll, 51, chose to spend her 51st birthday at the
auction. She celebrated by playing a tune on each of the pianos on
display.
   ``Now I can say I tinkled the ivories on Liberace's pianos. I
don't see how you can top this,'' she said.
   Not everyone was impressed by the items, however.
   Pat Howell, one of six friends who accompanied Ms. Carroll on
her birthday trip, found most of it ``pretty garish.''
   The 263-page auction catalog does contain some unusual items,
including several slot machines; a two-piece denim, rhinestone and
sequin suit; a pair of Portuguese glazed ceramic chickens; and a
13-inch rhinestone crown.
   Proceeds of the auction will go to the non-profit Liberace
Foundation for the Performing and Creative Arts, which provides
scholarships at 28 schools and colleges nationwide.

<HEAD>Cuban Chess Winner Is Barred From Taking Winnings To Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cuban chess grandmaster who won $10,000 in a
prestigious chess tournament in New York City has been barred from
taking the money out of the United States, according to a published
report.
   Guillermo Garcia, 34, of Havana went home Thursday without the
money because of the enforcement of a provision of the Trading With
the Enemy Act of 1917, The New York Times reported in its Sunday
editions.
   Quoting an unidentified Treasury Department spokesman, the Times
said the sanctions against Cuba were put into effect by President
Kennedy in 1963.
   ``It's very unfortunate and it saddens me,'' Garcia told the
newspaper before boarding a plane home after competing in the
$125,000 New York Open, which ended March 30.
   ``This is something that I never heard happen before in the
history of chess, where a grandmaster wins a prize and he can't
receive it,'' said Garcia, one of about 250 grandmasters in the
world and Cuba's national champion three times. He was second-place
winner in the New York City tournament.
   He said he believes ``politics should not intrude on sports
activities.''
   Lawyer Harold A. Mayerson is exploring the possibility of suing
the Treasury Department, the Times said.
   Mayerson said the law probably wasn't meant to be applied in
cases like Garcia's. ``And if it was, it carried a questionable
policy, the blockade of Cuba, to a ludicrous conclusion,'' he added.
   The Treasury Department spokesman said the $10,000 Garcia won
will go into an interest-bearing account in his name in the United
States.
   But an official of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control said the account will be blocked so that he can have
access to it only if he establishes permanent residence in a
country other than Cuba, Libya, Vietnam, North Korea and Cambodia,
the nations the law applies to, the Times said.
   The official, who also was not identified, said the sanction is
``to prevent transfer of hard currency to Cuba and to provide
leverage to reach a settlement with Cuba because of their
expropriation of U.S. property back in the early 1960s.''

   A commander gave his 3,500 troops a
day off as a reward for going a full month without any arrests for
drunken driving.
   The wing was given Monday off, said Air Force Col. Dale Stovall,
commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing. It was the third day
the wing has earned off in the last nine months for having an
arrest-free record during the preceding month.
   In March 1987, eight of the unit's airmen were arrested on
drunken driving charges.
   In addition to holding out the carrot of a day off, the Air
Force also brandishes a stick against those who are caught driving
while drunk, on or off the base.
   An airman can lose base driving privileges for a year. Enlisted
men can lose a stripe and face fines of up to a month's pay.
Officers can get a letter of reprimand and extra duty.
   And, regardless of rank, an offender must undergo treatment in
an alcohol rehabilitation program, Stovall said.

   The body of a stillborn baby, mistakenly taken
from a hospital with the dirty laundry, will be returned for
cremation in keeping with the parents' wishes, hospital officials
said.
   A worker at the Angelica Health Care Plant in Rome found the
body Thursday among laundry received from Atlanta's West Paces
Ferry Hospital, said Floyd County Police Capt. Tommy Shiflett.
   The infant was stillborn late Wednesday or early Thursday, said
hospital spokeswoman Karen Koch. Nurses wrapped the body in
blankets and took it to the morgue, following hospital procedure,
she said.
   The body should have been tagged for cremation, but apparently
was not, said Ms. Koch. ``Someone mistook it for laundry and tossed
it into the laundry basket.''
   The infant girl's body will be returned to the hospital after
investigation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, she
said. Then, ``it will be cremated according to the parents'
wishes.''

   The defendant had a familiar face, the juror said.
All too familiar.
   Truett Walton was on a jury panel lined up to hear an aggravated
robbery case against Sylvester Irving, and when State District
Judge Jack Hampton asked if anyone knew the defendant, Walton
raised his hand.
   Walton said he thought Irving was the man who came up to his car
and robbed him of $400 at knifepoint on June 5, 1984. Walton worked
for an insurance company at the time and had been collecting
premiums from clients.
   Walton was excused from the jury, went to police and picked out
Irving's photograph. Police filed aggravated robbery charges, and
the case was scheduled to be heard Tuesday by a grand jury.
   Meanwhile, Irving pleaded guilty to the previous aggravated
robbery charge before the jury was seated. He was sentenced to six
years in prison.
   ``This is a small world,'' said court bailiff Bill West. ``I
love it.''

   Nine teen-age Florida Senate pages were
arrested after a deputy found them having an unsupervised beer
party at a motel, the Leon County Sheriff's Department said Friday.
   If convicted, the teen-agers face sentences of up to 60 days in
jail and fines of up to $500. Those arrested Thursday night range

Florida's legal drinking age is 21.
   The one 18-year-old will appear in adult court, while the others
will be handled through juvenile court, he said.
   Senate officials planned no discipline because they had finished

   ``If they were drunk on the job it would be different,'' said
Todd. ``I don't think it's our responsibility to supervise them

   Police say that George White, the architect of
the Capitol, suffered minor injuries Friday when his government car
struck one of the barricades that White recommended be installed to
protect the Capitol from terrorists.
   Officer Dan Nichols of the Capitol police force said White, who
is responsible for the Capitol's buildings and grounds, was treated
by Capitol physicians, along with a driver who also received minor
injuries.
   Nichols said White's car struck the mechancial barrier at the
south entrance to the Capitol Plaza as the device, called a
``slammer,'' was being lowered to allow entry.
   ``Preliminarily, it looks like driver error,'' said Nichols,
adding that the investigation was continuing.
   White, a passenger in the back seat, disagreed with that
assessment. He said he thought the barrier had been lowered and
then rose unexpectedly, either because of a mechanical malfunction
or a barrier-keeper pushing the wrong button.
   ``We've had a couple of incidents like that,'' White said. ``My
driver's first rate. He's never had an accident. I can't imagine
him doing that.''
   White said his eyeglass frames were broken and his nose
scratched when the impact threw his head against a front-seat
headrest. He said the driver, Oscar Womack, received a cut on his
lower lip.
   He said the incident taught him that back seat passengers should
wear safety belts and that the barriers really work.
   ``They bring you to a sudden halt,'' he said.
   The front bumper of White's large black Mercury came to rest
atop the barrier. Cooling fluid was leaking from the vehicle and
the right front tire was flat.
   The hydraulic barriers, intended to prevent unauthorized
vehicles from entering the Capitol grounds, were installed last
year as part of a $13 million plan White recommended to tighten
security, according to Elliott Carroll, White's executive assistant.
   No terrorists have been reported snared by the slammers, but
last June a lowered barrier popped up as a White House car was
passing over it, leaving the vehicle stranded three feet in the air.

   A judge has ordered a man convicted of
sexual abuse to post a sign on his door warning children to stay
away.
   Wasco County District Attorney Bernie Smith said Friday that
Elmer J. Ellison, 77, of The Dalles had complied with Circuit Judge
John Kelly's order by posting a sign that reads: ``No children
under 18 allowed by court order.''
   Ellison also was placed on five years' probation, ordered to
undergo counseling and to pay for the girl's counseling. He was
sentenced to 45 days in jail, but was permitted to serve the time
in a work-release program, Smith said.
   Elllison was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse Feb. 3.
   Multnomah County District Judge Dorothy Baker in Portland last
year placed a similar requirement on a convicted child molester.
   The man was sent to prison for up to 10 years after violating
the terms of his probation by camouflaging a sign on his front door.

   Police set up a command post at Memorial
Coliseum and a holding tank for arrestees Friday in preparation for
a gang crackdown officials likened to the security taken for the
1984 Summer Olympics.
   Officials were tight-lipped about details of the planned sweep
Friday night through gang-terroized neighborhoods. However, Police
Chief Daryl Gates pledged last week to put 1,000 officers on the
streets to combat the gangs whose drive-by shootings have claimed
numerous lives, particularly in poor south-central neighborhoods.
   Margie Reid, a department spokesman, said she could not reveal
the specific number of officers to be deployed but acknowledged it
was the largest such operation ever carried out by the department.
   ``It is similar to the Olympics,'' Reid said, referring to the
elaborate security measures for the 1984 Summer Games in Los
Angeles.
   A command post was established at the coliseum, along with a
temporary holding facility for arrestees.
   ``Everything you could think of has to be arranged,'' Reid said.
   Gangs were blamed for 387 killings in Los Angeles County in
1987, and as many as 85 so far this year.
   Gang violence has long been a problem in Los Angeles and some
neighboring cities in Los Angeles County, and upsurges in violence
have triggered occasional outcries.
   However, local political leaders and police officials reached a
consensus for action when a recent gang shooting in the Westwood
district killed a young woman, and a drive-by shooting on Good
Friday killed one man and left a dozen other people wounded.
   The Police Department began large-scale sweeps of gang
territories using several hundred officers, and Mayor Tom Bradley
announced his next city budget would include allocations for 400
new police officers.
   In Sacramento, the state Assembly voted 48-13 on Thursday to
amend a bill to allow police to use wiretaps against suspected drug
dealers.
   There also have been calls for Gov. George Deukmejian to send
California National Guard forces to Los Angeles to help in gang
suppression, but city and county officials have made no formal
requests, said Tom Beerman, a spokesman for the governor in
Sacramento.
   On Thursday, Deukmejian suggested that it might be better to
have California Highway Patrol officers help out instead of the
National Guard, but Beerman said the governor was not making a
proposal.

   A federal jury awarded South Dakota
$200 million Friday in the state's antitrust lawsuit against Kansas
City Southern Railway Co. over the demise of a coal slurry project.
   Lawyers said the damage award would be tripled under federal
antitrust laws.
   Glen Johnson, a lawyer for the state, said the tripled damages
exceed the $500 million that the railroad listed as its net worth.
He had said during the trial that it was the largest case ever
tried in South Dakota in terms of damages.
   The jury found that Kansas City Southern conspired with other
railroads to thwart the project, in which Energy Transportation
Systems Inc., known as ETSI, would pipe crushed coal from Wyoming
to Southern states using Missouri River water that would be
purchased from South Dakota.
   Jurors also said the conspiracy resulted in restraint of trade
in the coal transportation market, hurt interstate commerce and
damaged the state of South Dakota.
   The jury deliberated 4{ days after hearing nine weeks of
testimony in U.S. District Court in Sioux Falls.
   Kansas City Southern lawyer John Shenefield called the verdict
``incorrect'' and predicted that the decision would be reversed on
appeal.
   Gov. George Mickelson said the state should not plan to spend
the award yet. ``It's not over,'' he said.
   The jury said Kansas City Southern intentionally interfered with
ETSI's contract to buy Missouri River water from South Dakota.
   The damages amount to what the state said was its loss of net
profits in the water sale contract, which was canceled after the
coal slurry project was abandoned in 1984.
   Former South Dakota Gov. Bill Janklow, who negotiated the water
sale contract with ETSI and who initiated the antitrust lawsuit,
said the tripled amount of damages is almost twice what the state
takes in every year in sales taxes.
   The state said in its suit that Kansas City Southern was
designated as the lead railroad in a conspiracy to kill the
pipeline project because it threatened to compete with hauling of
low-sulphur coal from Wyoming by rail.
   ETSI planned a $3.8 billion, 1,400-mile-long coal slurry line
but needed to cross railroad tracks and win numerous environmental
permits. The state contended that Kansas City Southern and other
railroads, which were not named in the lawsuit, teamed up to force
delays that eventually killed the project.
   Kansas City Southern's lawyers argued that the pipeline never
would have been built and would have failed if it had. The defense
admitted railroads were opposed to the project but denied any
conspiracy.

   Authorities on Friday identified the
victim of a car bomb explosion that scattered debris for two blocks
as a 26-year-old Colombian national with a criminal record.
   Giovanni Manuel Mancini, a part-owner in a tanning salon in
suburban Hurst, was killed in Thursday's explosion, said Fort Worth
Police spokesman Doug Clarke.
   Louis Iliano, an agent for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, one of several agencies involved in the
investigation, said Mancini had a criminal record but would not
reveal any details. He and other officials declined to discuss
possible motives.
   Witnesses told police that Mancini had parked his car and
crossed the street to order food at a barbecue stand when two men
in another car pulled up, threw an object into the car and sped
away.
   After he returned to the vehicle, there was an explosion strong
enough to blow the roof of the car more than 100 feet away,
authorities said.
   Kratz said that the car was rented Feb. 25 and that Mancini
lived in an partment nearby.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's message to New York
Democratic officials to get behind one of the party's three
presidential candidates may be helping Michael Dukakis more than
the other two, a Cuomo aide said Friday.
   ``After yesterday, I got a clear sense of some movement to
Dukakis,'' said John Marino, executive director of the state
Democratic Committee. ``By next Monday or Tuesday, we'll have a
much better felling for that. Maybe there'll be a bandwagon effect
(for Dukakis), but you may have a backlash reaction.''
   But the message from the governor seemed a bit ambiguous later
Friday, when Cuomo declared at a news conference that he did not
care whether Democratic leaders endorsed candidates or not.
   ``I did not offer instruction to people that they must endorse
or should endorse. Why should I? I haven't endorsed myself. I'm not
instructing or suggesting,'' the governor said.
   Cuomo also revealed that he has already voted by absentee ballot
for one of the candidates, but refused to say which one.
   And, the governor said he was in discussions with the three
candidates about making campaign appearances with them all, time
permitting. ``I'll go anywhere with them,'' he said.
   While there appeared to be some move among New York's most
influential Democrats toward the Massachusetts governor, Jesse
Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. were also picking up
endorsements.
   Marino's comments came a day after state Democratic Chairman
Laurence Kirwan told the state committee that they should line up
behind Dukakis, Jackson or Gore.
   While Kirwan's message, direct from Cuomo, was a repeat of a
Cuomo-Kirwan missive delivered several months ago, it had new
significance because it came so close to the April 19 primary.
   The first major leader to take Kirwan's advice was Erie County
Chairman Joseph Crangle, a former state chairman, who said he would
support Dukakis. Rochester's Thomas Fink, the state committee
secretary and a close ally of Kirwan, also lined up behind Dukakis.
   Also, The New York Times reported that several other major
Democrats _ Brooklyn Democratic leader Howard Golden, New York City
Comptroller Harrison Goldin, Queens Borough President Claire
Shulman and Rep. Stephen Solarz of Brooklyn _ were expected to line
up behind Dukakis soon.
   One super delegate who wasn't quite ready to toe the line was
Suffolk County Chairman Dominic Baranello, also a former state
chairman.
   ``What are they going to do, take away my citizenship?'' said
Baranello. ``We're going to sit tight awhile.''
   While Marino was talking about a possible move to Dukakis by New
York's Democratic leaders, Jackson scored a victory Thursday when
he picked up the backing of Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer.
   Also, Rockland County Chairman Vincent Monte said Friday that
he, Rockland County Executive John Grant, Orange County Chairman
Ellie Habig and Sullivan County Chairman Kay Bodgen would all
endorse Gore at a Sunday night news conference.
   At the state committee meeting Thursday, Kirwan told the
Democratic leaders that one thing Cuomo didn't want was for them to
remain on the fence or to back an ``uncommitted'' slate of
prospective delegates on the New York primary ballot who want to go
to the national convention and help orchestrate a draft-Cuomo move.
   ``We can't force them (to endorse), but we can tell them in no
uncertain terms that this is what we want them to do,'' said Marino
of Kirwan's message to state party leaders. ``There is no
uncommitted option for Cuomo because there is no Cuomo candidacy.''
   ``We're not going to pay any attention to it,'' said former New
York Rep. Richard Ottinger of Kirwan's message. Ottinger said the
uncommitted delegates hoped to convince other convention delegates
to turn to Cuomo if none of the announced candidates could lock up
the nomination.
   ``We feel it's important to have our strongest candidate,'' said
the Westchester County lawyer. ``We think that's Cuomo.''
   While Cuomo has said he doesn't want to be a candidate himself,
he has refused to rule out accepting a draft for the nomination if
there's a deadlocked convention.

   A former juror in a federal drug conspiracy
trial was sentenced Friday to three months in jail for writing
thank-you notes to a defendant who left flowers on her car and
telephoned her during deliberations.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Gerry also ordered the juror,
Patricia Hand, of Millville, to pay $46,850 to the government to
cover the costs of the 1987 trial.
   Five of the seven defendants were convicted, but Gerry threw out
the verdicts after learning of Mrs. Hand's contact with one
defendant.
   ``It was a cancer that she implanted on the judicial system,''
the judge said before sentencing Mrs. Hand. ``This travesty of
justice that resulted from her conduct brought the entire system
into disrepute for a short while.''
   He also ordered Mrs. Hand to serve three years' probation term
for what he called ``the indifferent folly and self-indulgence of
this woman.''
   Mrs. Hand, who pleaded guilty last June to a charge of contempt
of court, declined comment after Friday's sentencing.
   She was a juror from Feb. 11 to April 3, 1987, in the trial of
seven men charged with running a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring
in North Caldwell Township.
   Mrs. Hand testifed at a post-trial hearing that she spoke on the
telephone with defendant George Pepe twice one night when he called
her at home during deliberations. She also said she left two notes
for Pepe at a luncheonette near the courthouse after he left two
carnations on her car.
   A waitress at the luncheonette testifed that Mrs. Hand asked her
to act as go-between.
   Mrs. Hand's attorney, Howard Johnson, told Gerry his client was
a naive, innocent victim manipulated by Pepe. ``The actions of my
client were admittedly improper and in her words, stupid,'' he said.
   In the 1987 trial, the jury convicted five of the six other
defendants but did not reach a verdict on Pepe.
   Pepe, who faced a retrial, also pleaded guilty to a reduced
charge of using a telephone to advance a narcotics conspiracy.
   Gerry sentenced Pepe Friday to a two-year suspended sentence on
that charge. Pepe faces sentencing April 18 on a conviction of jury
tampering.

<TEXT>
   The lone survivor of the nation's second worst
air disaster should be allowed to ``grow without the glare of
publicity,'' a judge said in closing the court files of 4-year-old
Cecelia Cichan.
   Washtenaw County Probate Judge John Kirkendall said Thursday
that he took the action earlier this year to protect Cecelia from
the news media. She was called the ``miracle baby'' after emerging
as the only passenger to survive the crash of Northwest Flight 255
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Aug. 16.
   ``Her (Cecelia's) family has now requested that ... to assure a
return to as much normalcy as can be, that documents filed in this
court be closed to the public view,' ' Kirkendall wrote in his
order.
   Kirkendall ordered the sealing Jan. 19. The action will prevent
the use of the court file to trace Cecelia, who will turn 5 on
Sunday, or any relatives named in it or to determine how the money
she received is being used.
   Kirkendall's order also closed the record of $130,000 the child
received after surviving the crash.
   The file includes accounts of legal fees and donations from
well-wishers that were mailed to the Cecelia following the crash.
   Cecelia, whose parents and 6-year-old brother were among 156
people killed in the crash, now lives near Birmingham, Ala., with
her aunt and uncle, who were named her legal guardians.
   She was released to the relatives, Rita and Frank Lumpkin, on
Oct. 9 after being hospitalized with a skull fracture, a fractured
collarbone, a broken left leg and burns over 30 percent of her body.
   She underwent four skin graft operations at the University of
Michigan Medical Center for severe burns to her arms and legs.
   The Lumpkins have refused offers to appear on television talk
shows or to give interviews.

<TEXT>
   A leading opposition politician was
granted asylum Friday by Argentina after the Paraguayan government
ordered his arrest for accusing officials of involvement in drug
trafficking.
   ``Miguel Abdon Saguier presented himself in the Argentine
Embassy in Asuncion requesting diplomatic asylum, and it was
granted,'' said an Argentine Foreign Ministry communique reprinted
by Argentina's government news agency Telam.
   Saguier, 42, of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, is a friend
of President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina.
   Patricia Saguier said her husband decided to seek asylum Friday
morning after he was accused by the government of ``seeking the
destruction of the social structure'' for saying during a March
visit to Washington that ``the Paraguayan government protects
narcotics traffickers.''
   She told The Associated Press, ``He's doing fine and the
Argentine Embassy has granted him asylum. Now they are seeking a
safe conduct.''
   After meeting last month with Elliott Abrams, the U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, Saguier said that
``the relation between the (Paraguayan) government with narcotics
traffickers has been proved. ... It is those within the government
who are drug traffickers.'' He did not elaborate.
   Saguier's statements were reprinted in the Asuncion newspaper La
Tarde.
   The Paraguayan government has rejected Saguier's charges and
similar ones in February by the U.S. ambassador to Paraguay, Clyde
Taylor.
   Judge Cesar Martinez on Friday ordered Saguier's arrest on a
charge of violating ``the defense of public peace and the freedom
of persons.''
   Saguier's brother, Hermes Rafael Saguier, has been in the
Colombian ambassador's residence since March 23, when he helped a
former political prisoner escape from his heavily guarded house. He
has been granted Colombian asylum.
   President Alfredo Stroessner, 74, has ruled Paraguay since 1954.
He has crushed virtually all opposition.

   A 20-year-old developmentally
disabled man who disappeared after his family's home was left in
shambles by partying vandals six days ago was found Friday in
Indiana and returned to his home, police said.
   The party, which caused about $10,000 in damages to the home of
Corrinne and Wallace McConaghey while they were away on vacation,
apparently began after their son, Michael, gave out his number on a
Chicago radio station, saying he was lonely and a 17-year-old woman
responded, police said.
   Michael McConaghey was found noon today in Indiana, said a
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``No further
details are being given out at the request of his parents,'' she
said
   In a related development Friday, the woman, Lisa Wood of
Wheaton, was charged with the theft of the family's car, and
Michael Bastan, 19, of Hoffman Estates, and Daniel Converse, 24, of
Elmhurst, with possession of stolen property, Sgt. Doug Larsson
said.
   The auto was recovered from a forest preserve Monday, one day
after police were called to the family's home by neighbors and
interviewed Michael about the wreckage.
   Police also have three other youths in custody and recovered a
video camera, numerous pieces of camera equipment, a computer
printer and clothing. About $15,000 worth of the family's
possesions were stolen, police said.
   Deputy Chief Richard Hammer said Miss Wood apparently instigated
the party, which reportedly began March 29 and continued until
Sunday.
   Authorities said Miss Wood apparently contacted Michael after
hearing him give his phone number on a Chicago radio station and
saying he was loneley and wanted some calls.
   Miss Wood told police she kept Michael ``drunk and happy'' while
different groups of partygoers came to the house.
   Miss Wood apparently heard the radio program, called Michael and
arranged to come to the house, police said.

   A federal judge on Friday convicted reputed
mobster Salvatore Pisello of two counts of income tax evasion
stemming from an investigation of the businessman's activities at
MCA Records.
   U.S. District Judge William J. Rea rejected claims that $309,000
that Pisello, 64, failed to report on his 1984 and 1985 returns
should not be counted as income. Pisello contended the funds were
loans or advances.
   Rea, who heard the case without a jury, set sentencing for May
9. Pisello remained free on a $50,000 bond.
   Federal prosecutor Marvin Rudnick said Pisello, an alleged
associate of New York's Gambino crime family, faces up to 10 years
in prison and a $200,000 fine.
   According to evidence at trial, Pisello, who acted as an
independent record consultant, negotiated deals worth hundreds of
thousands of dollars for MCA, where he had been put in charge of
sales of discount records.
   The charges against him stemmed from a federal investigation of
abuses in the sales of ``cutout,'' or discounted, records.
   Witnesses testified that Pisello demanded cash payments for
himself in addition to checks that would be written to MCA for the
cutout records.

   A 12-member jury was impaneled Friday to
hear the federal trial of four polygamist clan members charged in
the January bombing of a Mormon chapel and a subsequent standoff
that left a lawman dead.
   U.S. District Judge Bruce S. Jenkins directed the jurors to
return to court Tuesday morning for preliminary instructions and
the start of testimony.
   The panel and two alternates were selected from an initial pool
of 170.
   ``I'm pleased with the jury, and I'm real surprised we got it
this fast,'' said defense attorney Fred Metos.
   Federal prosecutors informed the court Friday that they planned
to call about 200 witnesses, including neighbors of the defendants
and several reporters who were contacted by clan leader Addam Swapp
27, and matriarch Vickie Singer, 44.
   Swapp, Mrs. Singer, Swapp's brother Jonathan and Mrs. Singer's
son John Timothy Singer are charged with federal offenses ranging
from the attempted murder of federal agents during the standoff to
use of a bomb to destroy the Kamas Stake Center in Marion.
   Swapp and the two Singers had been charged with conspiracy in
the bombing and standoff, but Jenkins dismissed that count
Wednesday on a motion from prosecutors.
   Mrs. Singer, the widow of slain polygamist John Singer, and
Addam Swapp, who is married to Mrs. Singer's daughters Heidi and
Charlotte, espouse the practice of polygamy and other doctrines
taught by early Mormon leaders. The mainstream church abandoned
polygamy in 1890.
   Addam Swapp's attorneys had earlier requested that his trial be
moved out of Utah because of the prominence of the Mormon Church
here. Jenkins, who said he would rule on the issue during jury
selection, gave no indication Friday that he had ruled other than
his statements that the trial would resume Tuesday.
   The 13-day siege, which ended Jan. 28 in a shootout that killed
Corrections Lt. Fred House and injured Addam Swapp.
   The Utah Attorney General's Office plans to file homicide
charges in House's death. However, Associate Attorney General Paul
Warner said no charges would be lodged until after the federal
trial, which attorneys estimate will take two weeks to a month.
   Authorities have said John Timothy Singer is their chief suspect
in House's death.

   King Hussein told U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz that his country will not stand in for the
Palestinian people or the PLO in proposed Middle East peace talks,
the government said Friday.
   Shultz, who visited Jordan this week as part of a shuttle
mission to push the talks, has suggested that a team of Jordanians
and non-PLO Palestinians negotiate for Palestinians.
   The official Jordan News Agency said King Hussein gave Shultz a
``working paper'' of Jordan's principles for peace with Israel
during their three days of meetings. Shultz returned to Washington
on Friday.
   The secretary of state vowed to return and praised Hussein for
``having engaged seriously with us for peace in the region.''
   The Jordanian paper laid out six general principles calling for
Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories, self-determination
for the Palestinians, and an international Middle East peace
conference to include the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France
and China.
   The paper contained major differences with the Shultz peace
plan. Israel and the United States reject the idea of Palestinian
self-determination, which implies statehood. The U.S. plan offers
limited self-rule for Palestinians.
   Jordan has attempted to repair its tattered relations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, whose prestige has increased in
the Arab world because of a four-month wave of violent protests
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Jordan will not represent the Palestinian people in that
(international) peace conference and will not negotiate a
settlement on the Israel issue in place of the Palestine Liberation
Organization,'' the paper said.
   Shultz said in Israel and again in Jordan that the PLO could not
take part in peace talks unless it renounces violence and accepts
Israel's right to exist.
   Jordan said it is willing to attend the peace conference in a
joint delegation with Palestinians ``if the concerned parties agree
to this principle.''
   The PLO, obviously one of the ``concerned'' parties, has
rejected the idea of a joint delegation.
   Jordan said the international conference should be more than an
``international gathering aimed at starting direct negoations,'' a
reference to Shultz's concept. But it left unclear the extent to
which the conference would affect talks between warring states.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes any
international conference, arguing it would be stacked against his
country. He also opposes any proposal to surrender the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967 from
Jordan, Egypt and Syria.
   Shultz told Shamir he would have to give up some territory to
achieve peace, but did not favor the total withdrawal the Arabs
demand.
   Jordan said peace talks must be based on ``the illegality of
occupying other peoples' lands by force,'' wording taken from
United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which calls on
Israel to trade the captured lands for peace.

   Broadcast executive Ted Turner has been
charged with violating importing and possessing three black bears
and two cougars without a permit, officials said Friday.
   Turner, head of Turner Broadcasting Co., ordered that the
animals be brought to Florida from his South Carolina plantation
and released into the wild at Avalon Plantation, which he owns near
Capps, authorities said.
   One of the cougars was killed March 9 when a motorist struck it
near Capps, about 15 miles east of Tallahassee, said Henry Cabbage,
public information supervisor with the Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission.
   Assistant State Attorney Jim Hintz said he filed two counts of
importing non-native wild animals _ one for the black bears and one
for the western cougars _ and one count of possessing such animals.
   Turner faces a maximum penalty of $500 and 60 days in jail on
each of the three counts, if convicted. All the charges are
second-degree misdemeanors.
   Turner's secretary at Turner Broadcasting headquarters in
Atlanta said he was traveling and unavailable for comment Friday.
She said he received a mailed notice Wednesday asking him to come
to Florida, but that it did not state why.
   Hintz said Turner would be served with a summons for a May 4
arraignment.
   Turner applied for a permit last year to move the bears from
South Carolina and release them on his Florida property, but it was
denied, Cabbage said. No permit had been sought for the cougars, he
said.
   Game Commission Maj. Kyle Hill said Turner admitted he knew the
permit had been denied when he ordered the animals released.
   Cabbage said an attempt would be made to recapture the surviving
cougar, a female. The black bears, which are also found in Florida,
would be allowed to roam free because it would be impossible to
tell if a particular animal was one of Turner's, Cabbage said.

   A proposed $250,000 fine against Ryan
Air Service 10 months before one of its planes crashed, killing 18
people, was cut by more than 90 percent after a federal aviation
official questioned how the fine was calculated, investigators were
told Friday.
   The official, Federal Aviation Administration regional counsel
Donald Boberick, testified during a National Transportation Safety
Board hearing probing the Nov. 23 crash of Ryan Air Flight 103.
   The crash was the 10th Ryan Air accident in eight years; four
involved fatalities. The November crash was the nation's worst
commuter airline crash in 19 years. Only three of the 21 people
aboard the twin-engine commuter plane survived.
   During the 2{-day hearing, the four-member NTSB panel has
pointed out previous Ryan Air violations and wanted to know why the
proposed $250,000 fine for scores of record and flight violations
was slashed to $16,500.
   Ryan Air has sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws. Its planes were grounded in January as
part of a consent agreement with the FAA. Ryan Air had been
Alaska's largest commuter airline, serving more than 80 cities and
communities.
   The $250,000 fine was recommended by FAA operations inspector
Lou Gossen after he inspected Ryan Air 10 months before the crash.
   Boberick said Gossen had calculated that Ryan Air should have a
penalty equivalent to the loss of profit for 15 days, but that he
rejected the proposal because it was not a recognized method of
calculating sanctions.
   Fines can range from $100 to $1,000 for each violation. Boberick
said a revised proposal following that guideline was then submitted
to his office with the fine reduced to $25,000. The lawyer said
further review by his office lowered the fine to $16,500, because
some violations had been counted more than once, and some were
given the maximum fine when they should not have been.
   Gossen had considered prior infractions in figuring the $250,000
proposed fine, but Boberick said he had not been aware of earlier
violations.
   A final NTSB report on the November crash is expected later this
year.

   International drug trafficking such as that
in Central America represents an insidious threat to the national
security of the United States, White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker said Friday.
   Baker made his remarks to the World Affairs Council of Northern
California the day after protesters angry about the arrest and
expulsion of a reputed drug lord torched a U.S. Embassy annex in
Honduras.
   His comments also followed testimony by two convicted drug
smugglers before a U.S. Senate committee that federal officials
were aware that smugglers flew weapons from Miami to the Nicaraguan
Contras and brought cocaine into the United States in return
flights.
   The testimony took President Reagan by surprise, Baker said,
adding that the chief executive got word of it Thursday night at
his Santa Barbara ranch.
   ``The president was in a rage when I walked into the house,'' he
said, adding that Reagan has ordered an immediate investigation and
report.
   Baker said American intelligence agents say there is growing
evidence that the Panamanian government, as well as the Colombian,
is under the influence of powerful, pervasive international drug
trafficking organizations.
   Baker declined to comment on circumstances under which the U.S.
might consider using force to oust Panamanian Gen. Manual Antonio
Noriega, who faces U.S. drug trafficking charges.
   Washington has supported efforts to remove Noriega as chief of
the 15,000-member Panamanian military and police. Noriega
orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Delvalle in February
after Delvalle tried to fire Noriega. Delvalle, recognized by the
U.S. as Panama's official leader, is in hiding in Panama.
   Baker predicted that new measures in dealing with Noriega,
military or otherwise, might be unveiled within the next few days.
   Reagan announced sweeping economic sanctions against Panama
later Friday.

   An Israeli girl hiking in the West Bank with
friends was likely killed by a bullet fired from the rifle of
another Jewish settler, not from a stone flung by an Arab as
previously reported, Israeli media said.
   The reports, citing an army probe, raised the possibility that
one of the two settlers guarding the hikers inadvertently shot
15-year-old Tirza Porat during a clash with Arabs in the village of
Beita on Wednesday.
   The army said it had not determined the exact cause of the

led the army to blow up 13 homes in Beita belonging to Arabs

Secretary of State George P. Shultz says he won't be deterred from
trying again.
   Their reluctance to sign on to a two-stage U.S. proposal for
negotiations, means one deadline has passed and another almost
certainly will go by the boards.
   The first was Shultz's call for a reply by mid-March. Israel and
Jordan, the two key parties, did not turn him down. But they also
did not agree to the talks.
   The second deadline was mid-April, the target date for an
international peace conference. That obviously will not happen,
Shultz said Friday at his last stop in Amman, Jordan.

cut more for the wealthy, or increased outright on the poor and
middle class and reduced for the rich, according to the study by

<BYLINE>Is The Consumer Debt Load Too Much?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American consumers are borrowing more, but
monthly repayments have not been growing more difficult at the same
time.
   This odd situation has developed for several reasons, and the
consequences of it are puzzling economists whose job it is to
determine what the potential consequences could be.
   Here is the situation:
   1. Payback periods on installment loans have been extended, thus
reducing monthly repayments. The extension of maturities, which
began during the high interest times of the 1970s, is especially
true in the automobile market.
   2. Interest rates today, though considered high in relation to
the 1960s, are considerably lower than they were in the late 1970s.
You can buy more today without incurring higher monthly charges for
interest.
   3. Home equity loans have been developed over the past few
years, allowing homeowners to buy almost any type of product on
credit _ while enjoying a tax deduction.
   Moreover, the interest costs on home equity loans is lower than
rates on installment loans. The credit lines are bigger too _
largely because of housing price inflation _ thus encouraging some
buyers to go more deeply into debt.
   The situation exists in spite of one factor that might have been
expected to make the use of credit less attractive, that is, that
only 40 percent of credit card interest is tax-deductible, vs. 100
percent two years ago.
   While the phasing out of this deduction has reduced the growth
rate of credit-card debt _ to only 4.8 percent in 1987 versus 18
percent annually from 1983 to 1986 _ many borrowers have simply
switched to home equity loans.
   The consequences of what many people feel is a too-easy an
attitude toward borrowing are difficult to determine.
   Clearly, the use of credit does not instill fear in consumers as
it did the during the high-interest period just a few years ago.
The monthly burden has been lessened, and confidence in the future
is bolstered by strong employment.
   The sense of security that comes with a low unemployment rate is
enhanced further by a ``liveable'' inflation rates, and
expectations of higher incomes that seem to be developing after
several years of wage stability.
   Economic experience demonstrates, however, that the credit so
easily handled now can easily become a burden in the future.
Economic volatility is a fact of life. The economic climate can
change overnight, as dramatic oil price hikes _ and declines _
since the early 1970s have demonstrated.
   Another troubling question is whether the longer repayment terms
are merely putting off the day of reckoning. How far into the
future, for example, can a couple hope to extend their payments in
order to lower the montly burden?
   Perhaps the most reassuring evidence comes from the Federal
Reserve, often considered an ogre on such matters. The Fed's 1986
Survey of Consumer Finances, which compared 1983 and 1986
households, showed:
   1. A strong correlation between growth of debt payments and the
growth of household income.
   2. Most households which were heavily in debt in 1983 were less
so by 1986, a result of debt being paid down or growth of family
income.
   3. About 83.5 percent of all outstanding installment debt in
1986 was matched by financial assets or home equity of greater
value.

<HEAD>Shopping Malls: Limited Growth Potential, But Opportunities Do

   Robert Campeau has visions of turning
Bloomingdale's _ the star division of Federated Department Stores
Inc. _ into a national chain after he takes the retailer over.
There are fewer shopping centers being built these days, but
industry analysts say Campeau can still accomplish his goal.
   At a news conference in New York this past week, Campeau, the
chairman of the Toronto-based developer, Campeau Corp., said he
wants to expand Bloomingdale's after he completes his acquisition
of Federated. The New York-based chain, one of the hottest names in
retailing, has 17 stores, mostly in the East.
   But with approximately 1,500 large malls across the country _
those with more than 400,000 square feet and at least two
``anchors,'' or major stores _ the potential for expansion through
new shopping malls is limited.
   ``They've just filled the country with the things,'' said Fred
Wintzer, an analyst with the investment firm Alex. Brown & Sons
Inc. in Baltimore. ``There isn't room for a lot of malls.''
   In the heyday of mall construction in the early 1970s, malls
were being built at a rate of about 35 a year, said John Chapman,
research director of the International Council of Shopping Centers,
a trade organization.
   Today, that's down to about 25 a year, he said.
   Demographics dictate how many malls will be built, and where.
When the population of an area begins to swell, mall developers
begin to build.
   During the boom in the oil patch in the late 1970s and early
'80s, store chains expanded and malls were built in Texas and
Oklahoma.
   Today, the Washington D.C. area is ripe for expansion, Wintzer
said, noting that two new malls are being constructed in McLean,
Va., right next to an existing center.
   But in areas where there already are a number of malls, a
developer can still build, as long as he constructs a dynamic,
exciting mall.
   ``He's going to put up a much better mousetrap, with better
anchors'' to entice away business from more stodgy competitors,
Wintzer said.
   Developers also are building in what Wintzer called
``second-tier markets,'' such as Allentown, Pa., or Sheboygan,
Wis., which are smaller metropolitan areas.
   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with the investment firm Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, cited California and Texas _
despite the latter's recent economic slump _ as other markets for
new malls.
   If Campeau wants to open stores in those two states, he likely
would have to do so through new malls. He has agreed to sell
Federated's Bullock's stores in California and its Foley division
in Texas.
   Campeau could use Bloomingdale's as an anchor in malls he might
build. But analysts say his ownership of stores like Bloomingdale's
also will give Campeau leverage in malls being planned by other
developers.
   Bloomingdale's would attract to a new mall the other retailers
that a developer needs. Campeau might use his chain as a bargaining
chip to ``get a piece of the action'' in another developer's mall.
   There also are ways for Campeau to expand his chain without new
malls.
   ``He can take some of the space in existing department stores
and renovate it into a Bloomingdale's,'' said Tashjian.
   Campeau's expected focus on a Bloomingdale's expansion reflects
the fact that many department stores have little growth potential.
   Bloomingdale's and stores like the Seattle-based Nordstrom chain
are perceived as unique and different, Wintzer said. But other
department stores, such as Filene's in the Northeast, are not known
outside of their region.
   ``Those kind of operators will have a difficult time moving into
cities where they don't have a presence,'' he said.
   The Campeau story was not the only retail takeover news this
past week.
   F.W. Woolworth Co., the nation's 11th largest retailer, said it
had been notified that Dart Group Corp. planned to buy a
substantial amount of its stock. Analysts expect Dart _ which has a
string of unsuccessful takeover attempts behind it _ to make a bid
for Woolworth.

<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street analysts are looking for good news
on the dollar and international trade to put some fresh impetus
into the stock market's early-1988 rally.
   Such sustenance could come in the week ahead, they say, from a
meeting of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized nations in
Washington, or from the Commerce Department's monthly report on the
U.S. trade balance for February.
   Advance estimates call for the trade data to show continuing
improvement from the record levels it reached last fall.
   But even when stocks rose Friday to new highs since the October
crash, the mood of many analysts and money managers remained
subdued and unenthusiastic.
   Brokerage-firm analysts complain of a shortage of ideas or
investment themes that stir up any interest among their customers.
   Stanley Berge, analyst at the firm of Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day
Inc., describes current sentiment in the market as ``10 percent
long-term bulls, 10 percent long-term bears, and 80 percent
somewhere in the middle.''
   Much of the caution, of course, is the legacy of the crash last
fall. But some of its also may derive from memories of what
happened in the markets at this time a year ago.
   An inflation scare shot through the bond market, sending
interest rates sharply higher.
   Stock-market investors couldn't shrug that off. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials, after hitting a then-record high of
2,405 on April 6, fell to 2,216 by May 20.
   As it turned out, that was nothing compared to the collapse that
was coming later in the year. Still, it remains in Wall Streeters'
memories as a period in which even some big-time professional
traders got badly burned.
   It doesn't help now that bond traders are once again talking
about the possibility of Federal Reserve credit-tightening to keep
inflation at bay. Yields on long-term government bonds climbed from
about 8\ percent to the neighborhood of 8} percent in the past few
weeks.
   The atmosphere could improve, many observers believe, if the
markets keep getting encouragement from the news on the dollar and
foreign trade.
   Hopes on that score helped the Dow Jones industrial average
climb 102.13 points to a post-crash closing high of 2,090.19 in the
past week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.43 to 152.03;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market 7.19 to
381.83, and the American Stock Exchange market value index 4.06 to
300.49.
   Volume on the Big Board remained subdued, however, averaging
170.89 million shares a day against 146.80 million in the
holiday-shortened previous week.
   In the view of Michael Sherman, analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., the stock market has fared pretty well lately given
the circumstances.
   ``The market's ability to shake off periodic plunges and to
internalize problems in the bond market is a healthy sign,'' he
argues.
   ``Since we believe that the economy is continuing to grow at a
moderate pace with further increases in profits to be expected, and
since we believe that the problems in the bond market are not
severe, we think there is still a good chance that stocks will work
significantly higher by the middle of the year.''
   One risk to this forecast, Sherman acknowledged, would be an
unpleasant surprise on the trade deficit.
   ``We expect it to continue to improve,'' he said. ``But that
remains a key variable. Although we don't anticipate a major and
continuing deterioration in the trade deficit from this level, such
an eventuality would be negative.''

<BYLINE>Could the Bond Market Face Another Agonizing April?
^By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Could the bond market, invigorated by an
impressive rebound this past week, be in for a nasty replay of last
year's April disaster?
   Now as then, the dollar is the key.
   Bond prices had been depressed early in the week in response to
the government's latest report on unemployment, which showed
another drop in the jobless rate in March.
   Strong economic news is often read as a negative signal by bond
traders because it portends a jump in inflation, which would dilute
the value of fixed-rate investments.
   But by week's end, bond prices had rebounded as the dollar
stabilized in foreign-exchange trading and inflation fears subsided.
   The yield on the Treasury's closely-watched 30-year bond, up as
high as 8.90 percent on Monday, settled back to the 8.75 percent
range, where it had finished the previous week.
   The yield on the long bond moves inversely to its price.
   The battered dollar was lifted by reports that finance ministers
of the seven major industrialized countries would seek to stabilize
the U.S. currency at a meeting this coming week in Washington, D.C.
   The dollar is monitored by the credit markets as a sign of where
inflation might be headed. A falling dollar raises the prospect of
import-led inflation as well as the possibility that foreign
investors may not expand dollar-denominated holdings.
   Last April, the dollar's steep decline hammered bond prices,
catapulting the yield on the long bond from 7.81 percent on March
31 to 8.70 percent on April 24 _ its highest level since February
1986.
   That agonizing April cost brokerage firms around $650 million in
trading losses on bonds, reckons Perrin Long, a securities industry
analyst for Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Bond traders called it
a month of Bloody Mondays.
   Hardest hit was the sprawling, less liquid municipal market.
Prices there fell sharply as nervous investors rushed to redeem
their mutual fund shares.
   A year later, the precarious nature of the dollar's recovery has
traders wondering if history could repeat itself this April.
   ``There's this lurking negativism,'' said William V. Sullivan,
director of money-market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
``If the dollar continues to weaken, it is the problem for the bond
market this April as well.''
   The dollar's firmness could soon be tested if the industrial
powers that comprise the Group of Seven _ the United States,
Britian, France, Italy, West Germany, Japan and Canada _ fail to
provide fresh support for the U.S. currency.
   In addition to the upcoming meeting of the G-7 finance
ministers, the markets will have to digest another U.S. merchandise
trade report, due out Thursday. If report shows a lack of
improvement in the U.S. trading deficit in February, the dollar and
bonds could come under renewed pressure.
   The dollar has been pushed down in recent months by negative
news on the trade deficit _ which has indicated to traders that the
currency might have to fall further in order for U.S. exports to be
sufficiently competitive.
   The February trade figures and the parley of the Group of Seven
may well seal the bond market's fate for this April.
   ``I think we're playing a waiting game,'' said John V.
Sebastian, executive vice president of Clayton Brown & Associates,
an investment firm based in Chicago.

<HEAD>More Wheat Sold to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional 500,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat has been sold to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The sale, equal to about 18.4 million bushels, was handled by
the Peavey Co., 300,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 50,000; Artfer Inc.,
50,000; Garnac Grain Co. Inc., 50,000; and Louis Dryfus Corp.,
50,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the grain was sold under terms
of the long-term grain agreement between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
   Sims said the subsidies averaged $21.61 per ton, or about 59
cents per bushel of wheat.
   No selling prices were announced, but wheat has been averaging
about $2.72 per bushel recently, according to the USDA. That could
mean a farm value of about $50 million.
   The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on Moscow to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets
are required to seek U.S. approval. The Soviets were given approval
to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   So far, the Soviets have bought more than 8.5 million tons of
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year, as well as 4.1
million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of U.S. soybeans
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.
   Subsidies are provided under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. Private exporters are given surplus commodities
owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $20 to
more than $40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Sims said the Soviets have more than 510,000 tons remaining in
their current EEP authorization. An additional 1 million tons were
announced on April 4, plus some left over from earlier
authorizations.

<HEAD>US Takes Major Step Toward Antidumping Duties on Japanese
Forklifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government ruled Friday that
Japanese-made forklift trucks are being exported to this country at
``less than fair value,'' a major step toward ordering steep
anti-dumping duties on the vehicles.
   U.S. customs will be instructed to collect anti-dumping duties
ranging from 14 to nearly 57 percent, if the U.S. International
Trade Commission determines in the next 45 days that the Japanese
imports threaten material injury to domestic industry, a Commerce
Department announcement said.
   Friday's ruling came in response to a year-old petition by an
American forklift manufacturer, the Hyster Co. of Portland, Oregon,
four of its labor unions and other employees, aimed at halting
alleged ``dumping'' of underpriced Japanese vehicles.
   ITC hearings on the dispute have been scheduled in Washington
next Wednesday, with the final ruling expected in late May on
anti-dumping duties on forklift truck imports that in 1987 reached
245 million dollars.
   U.S. law provides for anti-dumping duties on imports with an
unfair price advantage over comparable American-made products.
Unfairness is established by the degree to which the vehicles were
sold in this country at prices less than those in their home
market, said Commerce Department spokesman John Thomas.
   The department listed percentages for major Japanese forklift
makers representing both the amount of alleged underpricing and the
level of duty to be collected. They included Toyota 17.19 percent,
Nissan 51.33, Komatsu Forklift Co. 47.73, Sumitomo-Yale 51.33,
Toyo-Umpanki 51.33, Sanki Industrial 13.65 and Kasagi Forklift
56.81. All other makers would be assessed 39.5 percent.
   William H. Kilkenny, chairman of the Hyster firm, said in a
statement, ``We are encouraged that the Department of Commerce has
confirmed our view of the unfair pricing practices of Japanese lift
truck producers. We are hopeful that the International Trade
Commission will now make a similar determination that will restore
fair market conditions.''

   Wall Street finished the week with a flourish amid hopes for a
stable dollar and reports that consumers are still borrowing and
spending freely.
   The stock market notched its fourth straight gain Friday with a
28.02-point jump that carried the Dow Jones industrial average to a
new high since the October crash.
   The Dow average of 30 blue-chip stocks closed at 2,090.19,
bringing its gain for the week to 102.13 points. The average's
previous closing high for the year was 2,087.37 on March 18.
   The market continued to draw strength from recent signs that the
dollar has steadied in foreign-exchange trading, reducing fears
that the Federal Reserve might soon have to tighten credit.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds rose
more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, dropping their yields
in the 8.7-8.75 percent range.
   Stock traders anticipated favorable news next week on the dollar
and international trade. On the dollar front, representatives of
the world's industrialized powers will meet in Washington, D.C.,
presumably to reaffirm their commitment to stabilizing world
currencies. On Thursday, the government will report its latest
estimate of the U.S. trade deficit, which if improved could also
bolster the dollar.
   The credit report from the Federal Reserve showed that Americans
took out $5.3 billion more in installment debt than they paid off
in February for the third consecutive monthly gain.
   The Fed said consumer debt increased at an annual rate of 10.3
percent in February, down slightly from the 12.2 percent rate of
growth in January. In that month, installment debt had risen by
$6.24 billion following a December increase of $4.3 billion.
   Analysts credited the big increases to strong auto sales and
noted that fears of an imminent recession had faded.
   In other economic news, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter threatened retaliation after Japan blocked a U.S. request
for creation of an international panel to resolve a dispute over
beef and citrus imports.
   The Japanese move came Friday in Geneva at a session of GATT,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States had asked GATT to form a panel of independent
experts to determine whether the Japanese citrus and beef import
quotas were consistent with international trading laws.
   In Vienna, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries gathered for talks on production and pricing. Oil prices
slipped on world markets in anticipation of the session, which is
not expected to produce any new strategies to reduce the world oil
glut.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall Ahead of OPEC Meeting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As members of a special OPEC committee prepared
to meet, oil prices fell amid a market belief that significant
developments will not emerge from the session.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, settled
Friday at $16.88 per 42-gallon barrel, down 18 cents from
Thursday's close. Most other contract months lost 20 cents.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil for May delivery fell 0.27 cent a gallon to 45.46 cents, while
wholesale unleaded gasoline for May edged down 0.05 cent a gallon
to 48.77 cents.
   Analysts said oil traders don't expect the weekend meeting of
OPEC's pricing committee in Vienna, Austria, to produce a plan to
combat a world price slump.
   That feeling was reinforced by a statement Friday by Indonesia's
oil minister, who said on his arrival in Vienna that the meeting
was unlikely to produce any changes in the current oil policy of
the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``We need something very significant to take us through these
(price) levels,'' said Chris McCormack, an oil futures broker for
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``This meeting is not
of any consequence.''
   In addition to the Indonesian oil minister, the five-member OPEC
pricing panel is made up of ministers representing Saudi Arabia,
Nigeria, Venezuela and Algeria. They are expected to assess oil
market conditions and recommend action for the next full meeting of
the cartel, which is set for June 8.
   Last December, OPEC agreed to retain existing oil production
quotas for the individual member countries in hope of holding crude
prices at $18 a barrel.

<HEAD>Black Monday Fears Have Eased Considerably, Business School
Students Say</HEAD>

   Fears about a career crash in the
aftermath of Black Monday have abated at leading graduate business
schools, but many students are shying away from Wall Street in
favor of other positions ranging from consulting to property
development, delegates to an annual conference say.
   ``For me, real estate management was the way to go and it became
even more attractive after the market crash,'' said David Marino, a
24-year-old student at the University of California graduate
business school.
   Marino was one of 120 student delegates from nearly 30 of the
nation's top business schools attending the three-day conference
that began Friday at Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg
Graduate School of Management in Evanston, a stately community on
Lake Michigan just north of Chicago.
   The theme of the conference, sponsored by Nabisco Brands Inc.,
was the outlook for the service industry. But against a background
of economic uncertainty raised by the Oct. 19 stock collapse,
career paths was an unofficial discussion topic.
   At the opening of the conference, the Kellogg school released a
survey of delegates that showed the crash generally had not
affected their career plans. The survey also showed nearly half
intend to pursue finance or consulting jobs upon graduation. Others
said they would go into high technology, advertising and
entertainment industries. A few chose careers in non-profit
businesses.
   ``I never felt threatened by the stock crash but there were a
lot of people worried,'' said James Depina, a 27-year-old
University of Michigan delegate, who has accepted a summer position
at the Bank of Boston.
   Students said many Wall Street firms, which historically have
been heavy hirers at leading business schools, still visited
campuses this year but the number of recruits had shrunk.
   ``In October there was strict panic,'' said Kelly Kay, a
28-year-old student at the University of Southern California's
graduate business school.
   ``The shock has settled somewhat,'' said Kay, but he has
accepted a health-care consulting job upon graduation.
   Others said the allure of investment banking, renowned for its
grinding hours and high pay, had faded at many schools, replaced by
management consulting and accounting careers, which also offer
lucrative starting salaries ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.
   ``Consulting is the rage now. The growth in consulting is
explosive and it pays incredibly well,'' said Dartmouth student Red
Barrett, who has accepted a position at Boston's Fidelity
Investment Management mutual fund company upon graduation.
   But Barrett, an English major who worked at a small Wall Street
firm before going to business school, expressed mild concern about
his choice, partly because Fidelity announced post-crash layoffs
earlier this year.
   ``When I looked at the headline about Fidelity I said, `Oh boy,
is this a mistake?''' Barrett said, though he noted that most of
the layoffs affected clerical staff hired during the company's
pre-crash boom.
   Conference events ranged from panel discussions by leading
members of the service industry to worshops on marketing, one of
Kellogg's biggest strengths. Delegates from Stanford University
planned to show a 20-minute video they produced on business ethics,
another emerging curriculum item in business schools in the wake of
the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
   James P. Gorter, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and one of
the conference speakers, said a large number of students had
declined offers from the firm this year, although the firm's
recruiting needs had declined.
   He speculated part of the reason was the tainted image of
investment banking in general, caused partly by Boesky and
co-conspirator Dennis Levine.
   ``Some students saw the bloom was off the rose and got into
consulting,'' Gorter said. ``But I'm not sure that's the right way
to go.''
   Mark Sheridan, a 28-year-old Cornell delegate who pursued a
double engineering-business degree, said he believed a good part of
his class had pegged hopes on Wall Street careers before the crash.
   ``You see a lot of chameleons out there,'' Sheridan said.
``Suddenly they're all into consulting.''
   Some students said the crash indirectly affected their career
plans because of personal stock holdings, which declined sharply in
value.
   ``I had some equity investments financing my business-school
education,'' said Bryce Hausmann Jr., a 30-year-old delegate from
the University of Washington. Asked how he managed after the crash,
Hausmann said ``I went into the debt market. I took out a student
loan.''
