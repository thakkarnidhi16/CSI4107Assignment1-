   More than 130 heart patients are alive today
because of the sacrifices William Schroeder made, the surgeon who
implanted his artificial heart said Sunday at a memorial dedication.
   Dr. William DeVries implanted the Jarvik-7 heart in Schroeder on
Nov. 25, 1984, and the second man ever to receive the device went on
to become the person to survive the longest with it, 620 days,
before he died Aug. 6, 1986, at Humana Hospital Audubon in
Louisville, Ky.
   A 13-foot stainless steel sculpture, ``Gateway to the Heart,''
was dedicated Sunday at the Bill Schroeder Sports Complex.
Schroeder's widow, Margaret, attended the ceremony.
   ``I owe a lot to Bill Schroeder and I think the world owes a lot
to Bill Schroeder,'' DeVries said. ``Today in the United States
alone there are over 130 patients that are alive today because of
what he did.
   ``These people would not have had the chance to live with the
artificial heart. These are all patients that have had to bridge a
transplant who are currently alive because of what he gave, the
legacy he gave,'' DeVries said.
   All patients who received experimental permanent implants of
artificial hearts since Barney Clark received the first one in 1982
have died. As a result, the federal Food and Drug Administration
allows the device to be used now only as a bridge until a compatible
human heart can be transplanted.
   Mrs. Schroeder said the location of the privately financed
memorial by sculptor Bernard Hagedorn was special to her because
sports were her husband's second love after his family.
   ``As I gaze at the `Gateway to the Heart,' I can envision so many
different meanings of what it symbolizes,'' she said. ``But with its
meanings, the underlying theme to me has to be home. When Bill was
in the Air Force, we made home in many different parts of the
country, but deep in his heart home was always Jasper, Indiana.''

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said Sunday that
efforts are failing to educate blacks and Hispanics about the deadly
AIDS virus and that illiteracy might by the problem.
   ``It is a real problem in this country,'' Koop said at a news
conference before an address to the annual meeting of the
Association of American Medical Colleges.
   ``We have made the effort to try to employ ... black and Hispanic
public relations firms ... in order to get our message to that
particular group ... so it's very difficult to understand where
these black and Hispanic groups are making their errors,'' Koop said.
   Of the 77,994 AIDS cases reported since June 1981 in the United
States, 26 percent were among blacks and 15 percent among Hispanics,
according to statistics through Nov. 7 from the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   Koop said such barriers as illiteracy in the black and Hispanic
communities might be part of the problem in conveying information
about how to prevent the disease.
   Another factor is poor access to health care among blacks and
Hispanics, as well as other groups at high risk for contracting
AIDS, including prostitutes and drug users.
   ``We have to make sure that they get (health care),'' Koop said.
But often, ``they don't know where to get it ... and many times, the
medical profession doesn't feel comfortable treating them.''
   ``AIDS ... is a mystery,'' he said. ``It scares people. It is
fatal, and that scares people ... and therefore it's very hard to
reach out'' and talk frankly about the disease.
   Also at the news conference, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, associate
director for AIDS research at the national Institutes of Health,
said efforts are being made to include more blacks and Hispanics in
clinical trials of anti-AIDS drugs.
   Hundreds of demonstrators who temporarily closed the federal Food
and Drug Administration headquarters in Rockville, Md., on Oct. 11
had complained that white men were being given primary access to
experimental treatments.

   A strong earthquake occurred in the vicinity of
Papua New Guinea in the Western Pacific, the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Center said Sunday.
   The quake measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale hit at 4:16 p.m.
(9:16 p.m. EST) near 1.7 South latitude and 150.2 East longitude,
the center said.
   The quake was not powerful enough to generate a Pacific-wide
tsunami, or tidal wave, the center said.
   The National Earthquake Information Center said the earthquake
occurred about 125 miles northwest of Rabaul, New Britain, and that
there were no immediate reports of damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage.
A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before
the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the
Richter scale.

   PLO leaders accepted a U.N. resolution
Sunday implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist and
recommended the PLO's parliament endorse the decision.
   Approval by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, is virtually certain and would meet one of the
conditions for U.S. recognition of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The action by a committee of PLO leaders showed that chairman
Yasser Arafat has won his struggle with hardliners over the
controversial U.N. Resolution 242. In the 450-member PNC, 80 percent
to 85 percent of the parliamentarians are aligned with Arafat.
   In Washington, President Reagan was asked if he was pleased with
the PLO leaders' action and said, ``We're still looking at that;
that's all I can say.''
   In another development, Abul Abbas, the Palestinian who
masterminded the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro
in 1985, spoke to reporters about the incident and dismissed the
killing of American Leon Klinghoffer as similar to a motoring
accident, the New York Times reported Monday.
   ``Maybe he was trying to swim for it,'' the Times quoted Abbas as
telling reporters outside the hall where the PNC is meeting. He
compared the hijacking to driving a car and said ``You have an
accident on the way. Accidents happen.''
   Klinghoffer of New York City, a 69-year-old wheelchair-bound
passenger, was shot and pushed overboard during the hijacking.
   The declaration accepting the U.N. resolution will be presented
to the plenary session of the PNC, which began a special four-day
meeting in Algiers on Saturday.
   ``The PNC will come out with a political decision and a program
of peace,'' PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said.
   ``In the political statement, we will adopt all resolutions of
the U.N. Security Council dealing with the Palestinian question.
What's more, we will emphasize resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis
for an international conference to achieve peace in the Middle
East.''
   Resolution 242 calls for an end to hostilities and Israeli
withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war. Adopted by the
Security Council in 1967, it implicitly recognizes Israel by
referring to the right of all states in the area to live within
secure and recognized borders.
   Resolution 338, passed in 1973 during the Arab-Israeli war, calls
for an end to fighting; urges implementation of Resolution 242 and,
most important, calls for negotiations between Arabs and Israel
toward ``a just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
   In closed-door committee meetings, there was strong opposition to
Resolution 242 from the Marxist-oriented groups, particularly George
Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Habash's faction is the second-largest of the eight groups
comprising the PLO. Arafat's Fatah is the largest.
   Sources close to the talks said that after two days of haggling,
it was clear no compromise was possible.
   Habash agreed to note his reservations but bow to the majority
and not create a major split.
   Salah Khalaf, a top Arafat aide known as Abu Iyad, said, ``Never
in my career have I seen the Palestinian leadership acting as
responsibly as it is during this session. Unity is priority and the
minority is accepting the verdict of the majority without any hard
feelings.''
   Abdul-Rahman said the council wanted to adopt resolutions
unanimously, although it also was capable of operating by majority
rule.
   The Palestinian council meeting is expected to conclude Tuesday
with a declaration of independence for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Those opposed to Resolution 242 objected to its referring to the
future of Palestinians in the occupied territories as ``a just
settlement of the refugee problem.''
   The Algiers conference was called to deal with the new
developments in the Middle East and especially to take advantage of
increased attention and sympathy for the Palestinian cause sparked
by the uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   More than 310 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed in
the 11-month uprising.
   Besides a declaration of Palestinian independence and approval of
a political program that includes acceptance of Resolution 242, the
conference was expected to establish a provisional government.
   Abdul-Rahman said there was a draft resolution on a provisional
government.
   ``This draft calls for formation of the government by the central
council and the executive committee (of the PLO), and the timing is
linked directly to the conclusion of preparations for an
international conference,'' said Abdul-Rahman.
   PLO officials, including Abdul-Rahman, have stressed that the
provisional goverment, when it is formed, would not be an
alternative to the PLO but an institution of the PLO mandated to
negotiate peace.

   Freed hostage Mithileshwar Singh said
his months in the captivity of Islamic fundamentalist kidnappers
left no emotional scars, but he feels guilt that his friends are
still being held, and believes much of the fault lies with the
Reagan administration.
   In an interview published in the Sunday editions of The
Journal-News of Nyack, N.Y., Singh said he wonders what is holding
up the liberation of nine remaining American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I see French hostages; they're all out. I look to German
hostages; they're all out. I'm happy for all of them. But we have
not done something to get (the Americans released),'' Singh said in
the interview Friday.
   ``If somehow we could unfreeze our positions it would help,'' he
added. ``Negotiations do not mean concessions.''
   Nine Americans are among the 14 foreigners being held hostage in
Lebanon.
   Singh, 61, was released Oct. 3 by Moslem extremists who had been
holding him hostage for 20 months. Three of his American colleagues
from Beirut University College, Jesse Turner, Alann Steen and Robert
Polhill, remain in captivity.
   ``After you stay so long, for so many hours, with so many
friends, you are out and they are still behind. You feel a sense of
guilt,'' Singh said.
   However, the captivity left ``no mental, no physical scar of any
kind,'' the Indian citizen, who is a legal resident of the United
States, said at the Stony Point Center. He has stayed at the retreat
and conference center run by the United Presbyterian Church since
returning to the United States.
   Singh had been in the Lebanese capital since 1982 working as
chairman of the business department at Beirut University College. He
and his colleagues were kidnapped on the night of Jan. 24, 1987,
when armed men showed up at a meeting they attended.
   ``The treatment could be characterized as relatively better than
we had anticipated,'' he said. The captors provided playing cards
and chess sets for their amusement, decent food and adequate medical
care.
   ``The four of us kept together. That was an integral part of the
whole thing,'' Singh recalled. ``We were able to discuss, able to
analyze, we were able to share each other's frustrations,
disappointments and hopes and aspirations.''

<TEXT>
   A South African envoy held talks Saturday with a
special U.N. representative on details of an independence plan for
South-West Africa.
   The meeting at a Geneva hotel took place on the fringe of a new
round of U.S.-mediated talks aimed at ending 73 years of South
African control over South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, and
setting the timetable for a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola.
   No full session was scheduled yet in the three-day talks
involving Cuba, Angola and South Africa, which were scheduled to end
Sunday. Tough bargaining appeared to be going on in a continuing
series of bilateral discussions.
   ``We are still in a preliminary phase,'' Cuban chief delegate
Carlos Aldana told reporters.
   Neil van Heerden, a Foreign Ministry official heading Pretoria's
delegation, met Saturday with Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N.'s special
representative on Namibia.
   The two discussed technical questions, South African spokesman
Roland Darroll said. He did not elaborate.
   The U.N. plans to send a peacekeeping force to Namibia after a
framework for independence is agreed to.
   The four-party talks, which began in May, are aimed at an accord
on the withdrawal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops backing a
Marxist government in Angola. South Africa has made a satisfactory
pullout agreement its precondition for launching an independence
process for Namibia, a former German colony it seized after World
War I.
   At least one further round of talks, mediated by a delegation
headed by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, is due
to be held in Brazzaville, Congo, at a date still to be set.
   Cuban troops have been helping Angola fight Western-backed UNITA
rebels. South African forces for years used Namibia as staging
ground for raids in support of the rebels.

<HEAD>African National Congress Official Says Mandela May Be Released
Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A representative of the African National Congress
said Saturday the South African government may release black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday.
   ``There are very strong rumors in South Africa today that on Nov.
15 Nelson Mandela will be released,'' said Yusef Saloojee, chief
representative in Canada for the ANC, which is fighting to end
white-minority rule in South Africa.
   Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago,
was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the
South African government. He was transferred from prison to a
hospital in August for treatment of tuberculosis.
   Since then, it has been widely rumored Mandela will be released
by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the
South African government.
   ``It will be a victory for the people of South Africa and indeed
a victory for the whole of Africa,'' Saloojee told an audience at
the University of Toronto.
   A South African government source last week indicated recent
rumors of Mandela's impending release were orchestrated by members
of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into
taking some action.
   And a prominent anti-apatheid activist in South Africa said there
has been ``no indication (Mandela) would be released today or in the
near future.''
   Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial separation.

   A smoky fire in a mobile home early
Saturday killed a family of five, authorities said.
   Fire Chief Bill Haggard said the victims probably died of smoke
inhalation. The cause of the fire, which was reported at 5 a.m., was
under investigation.
   ``There was lots of smoke,'' Haggard said. ``The front room was
on fire. How long it had been burning, we don't know.''
   Ralph Williams, the Herculaneum fire marshal, said the family had
no electricity or gas in the trailer home. Herculaneum is 20 miles
south of St. Louis.
   Officials declined to identify the victims, but neighbors said
those killed were Paul and Maria Adams, both in their 20s; and their
children, Brian, 4; April, 3; and Anthony, 9 months.
   Officials said that the Adamses had used candles to light the
trailer, but that had apparently not been the cause of the blaze.
   Neighbors said the family had not been able to pay their electric
bills and had had the electricity shut off. They said they believed
Adams worked at an auto repair.

   An underground fire at a trash dump burned
for a second day Saturday, and firefighters were ordered away from
the site.
   Tests by the state Department of Health ordered after witnesses
noted strong odors and multi-colored flames determined toxins from
the fire were within acceptable limits, fire officials said late
Saturday night. There has been speculation that toxic materials may
be buried in the dump and burning.
   The fire was estimated to be 30 to 40 feet underground and
covering an area of 300 feet to 400 feet.
   The fire at the dump, which has been closed by court order since
Oct. 5 for operating without a permit, was first reported early
Friday morning. Neighbors said they saw smoke coming from the dump
several days earlier.
   Homes near the dump, about 20 miles north of Albany, were
evacuated.
   The chief of the Rock City Falls Fire Department _ in whose
jurisdiction the fire is burning _ reportedly ordered firefighters
off the scene Saturday. He could not be reached Saturday for further
comment.
   Officials told residents to leave their homes Friday night after
a state Department of Environmental Conservation air quality team
found toxins in the smoke from the dump fire.

<TEXT>
   Five guerrillas held a UNIFIL command post in
the Israeli security zone in south Lebanon Sunday but have
apparently reached an agreement with U.N. troops surrounding the
post, Israeli and U.N. officials said.
   The guerrillas, armed with submachine guns and hand grenades,
seized the command post Saturday night in the village of Taibeh,
about a mile north of the Israeli-Lebanon border. It was not clear
to what organization the guerrillas belonged.
   They overpowered a single UNIFIL sentry who stood guard while
four other soldiers slept, UNIFIL spokesman Timor Goksel said. The
sentry alerted U.N. troops stationed nearby.
   He did not report any casualties in the attack on the post,
manned by Finnish troopers of the 5,800-member United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon.
   The guerrillas have demanded a UNIFIL escort out of the command
post, Goksel said in an interview Saturday night.
   ``There's a bit of a problem. ... They (the guerrillas) are
somewhat disoriented, perhaps intoxicated,'' Goksel told The
Associated Press. ``We are trying to sort of talk them out of the
place. They are more relaxed now and their hostility has dropped.
   ``It didn't sound like a hostage game but we of course cannot
allow an escort. We do not know what their intentions are,'' he said.
   On Sunday, a UNIFIL official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said ``there is no change in the situation.''
   But an Israeli military official, who also insisted on anonymity,
said UNIFIL has reached an agreement with the guerrillas. He said
the guerrillas would leave the area accompanied by a UNIFIL escort
and on condition that the Israeli army would not intervene.
   Goksel said UNIFIL did not ask for help from the Israeli army or
the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-allied militia in southern
Lebanon. ``That would make things more difficult,'' he added.
   Israel carved out the Security Zone, a strip of land north of the
Lebanese border, when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from
Lebanon in 1985 after the 1982 invasion. The 6-10 mile-wide brder
strip is patrolled by Israeli military units and militiamen of the
South Lebanon Army.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Seen As Early Test on Whether Bipartisanship Possible</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One early test on the possibility for
cooperation between President-elect George Bush and the
Democrat-controlled Congress will be on Nicaragua, perhaps the most
contentious foreign policy issue of recent years.
   At a news conference last Wednesday, Bush said the Nicaraguan
Contras will have ``high priority'' in his administration, and he
pledged to ``keep the pressure on the Sandinistas'' to institute
democratic reform.
   But he stopped short of saying that a proposal for military aid
will be sent to Congress.
   The Reagan administration and Congress were never able to achieve
a consensus on Nicaragua because of philosophical differences that
were compounded by deep personal mistrust among the leaders in both
branches.
   In an interview last week, outgoing Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams, the administration protagonist on Contra aid for
more than three years, said the emergence of a ``whole new cast of
characters'' in January could give the Contra aid cause a shot in
the arm.
   In effect, he said the Democrats opposed to Contra aid have been
saying, ``We don't trust President Reagan and his associates. We
don't think you are really serious about negotiating.''
   Abrams said that with a new group taking over on January 20, ``it
would be very odd for Congress to start the relationship by saying,
`Glad to meet you. We don't trust you.'''
   He said a ``significant reduction'' in personal bitterness
combined with the ``increased repression'' in Nicaragua will tilt
the congressional balance in favor of the Contras.
   Much of the bitterness Abrams alluded to was directed at him
personally, mostly because leading congressional Democrats felt his
word could not be trusted.
   But congressional sources doubt that the new administration will
choose to do battle early on with Capitol Hill on an issue as
divisive as Contra aid.
   This is said to be the position of House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Tex., who believes Contra aid is a ``dead issue,'' according to an
associate.
   ``The conventional wisdom is that they (the incoming
administration) will pick fights that they can win and this a
clearly not one of them,'' said one congressional source, insisting
on anonymity. ``The mood in Congress has not changed.''
   One alternative to renewed Contra military aid is additional
international pressure on the Sandinistas. Secretary of State George
P. Shultz is expected to issue an appeal for such pressure when he
addresses a meeting of hemispheric foreign ministers on Monday in El
Salvador.
   But Abrams believes diplomatic pressure must be supplemented by
military pressure, calling the Contras a ``critical element'' for a
successful policy.
   During the campaign, Bush sought to avoid references to
Nicaragua, partly because raising that issue could have revived
memories of the Iran-Contra affair, a subject on which he generally
was on the defensive.
   Still, Bush did say three weeks ago that he ``absolutely'' would
ask Congress for Contra military aid if there is no progress in the
Central America peace process.
   On Thursday, Wright indicated a willingness to pursue a fresh
start with the Bush administration on Nicaragua.
   ``I hope it will be possible in Nicaragua that we might find some
avenue which both of us can embrace, a path on which we can walk
hand in hand,'' he said.
   Reagan lost his last bid for congressional approval of military
aid in February. Since then, once in March and again in September,
Congress has agreed to six-month allocations of humanitarian aid in
the form of food, clothing, shelter and medical services.
   The aid is being distributed to camps on the Honduran side of the
Nicaraguan border where about 10,000 rebels have gathered since last
spring. An estimated 2,000 remain inside Nicaragua. Many experts
doubt the Contras can ever be reconstituted as an effective fighting
force but Abrams disagrees.
   ``Humanitarian aid does serve to keep them as an organized force
until we can turn Congress around,'' he said.

   The U.S. semiconductor industry is feeling the
chill breeze of a slowdown for the first time since the disastrous
collapse of 1985 and 1986.
   Only recently the industry seemed robust, with record sales and
profits. But three events last week illustrated that setbacks occur
quickly in the volatile business:
   _A key measure of the chip industry's health, the book-to-bill
ratio, fell to 0.92, its lowest point since November 1985. A reading
below 1.00 often signals a slump.
   _Surprising analysts, National Semiconductor Corp. said it
expects to report a ``significant'' operating loss for its fiscal
quarter ending Nov. 27.
   _Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it will lay off as many as
1,000 U.S. workers, or 7 percent of its work force.
   The good news is that few industry watchers expect the coming
slowdown to be as severe as the one in 1985-86, when American chip
makers lost $500 million and Silicon Valley lost more than 17,000
electronics jobs.
   The mid-decade depression in the chip business stemmed from vast
overproduction, which led to accumulation of excess inventories that
took nearly two years to work off.
   Chip makers, distributors and users are monitoring inventories
much more closely this time to prevent them from getting too high,
analysts say.
   ``No way are we going to have that kind of inventory cycle that
led to the last crash,'' said Elizabeth Baatz, an economist for
Cahners Publishing Co. in Newton, Mass.
   Ms. Baatz is forecasting a decline of about 3 percent next year
in sales to the North American market by the world's chip makers.
   Other sources are more optimistic. U.S. sales of semiconductors
should rise 12 percent next year, according to a poll of chip makers
released in September by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.
   But even a 12 percent increase would be far from the 30 percent
growth the industry is experiencing this year.
   The chip business does not tolerate slow growth as well as other
industries because it needs good sales to recoup the enormous cost
of building state-of-the-art fabrication plants.
   The last industry recession drove some companies out of business,
and even a mild softening this time would hurt the ability of U.S.
chip makers to research, develop and invest for the future. In
contrast to the Japanese giants, most American chip makers lack
other lines of business to carry them over the rough spots.
   ``It's very tough if you're not prepared to deal with it,'' said
Larry Borgman, an analyst in New York for Nomura Securities
International Inc.
   The biggest factor in the slowdown is a softening of sales of
personal computers, mainly the less expensive models, analysts say.
   Companies such as Advanced Micro that sell heavily to personal
computer makers are among the first to be hurt. Also, AMD lags in
switching over to CMOS technology, which is for chips that consume
less power.
   But Advanced Micro insists it will not be the only company to
suffer. ``We just fell out of bed first,'' said Michael Kubiak, the
head of investor relations for the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company.
   Texas Instruments Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. still are
enjoying the benefits of a shortage of production capacity for
DRAMs, or dynamic random access memories. They are the only
U.S.-based companies that sell those chips to the open market.
   But Japanese companies, which control 90 percent of the world
DRAM market, are spending heavily on new capacity. Sometime next
year the increased production will cause DRAM prices to fall,
probably steeply, analysts say.
   Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc. are in a better position to
withstand a softer market, according to Millard Phelps, an analyst
for Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
   Intel, in particular, is the only producer of the 80386
microprocessor that goes into fast, expensive and hot-selling
personal computers from International Business Machines Corp.,
Compaq Computer Corp. and others. Intel has been unwilling to
license the microprocessor to other manufacturers except IBM, which
so far has shown no interest in making the chip.
   Finally, some specialty chip makers such as Cypress Semiconductor
Corp., Xicor, LSI Logic Corp. and VLSI Technology Inc. have products
that are in demand and should stay that way for awhile, analysts say.
   ``We are at the end of the semiconductor (business) cycle, to be
sure,'' Phelps said. ``But we're painting the entire industry with
the same brush. There are definite differences. Those differences
are the place to focus today.''

<HEAD>Latin Nations To Meet For Debt Strategy Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>

   Latin American nations will meet in
late November to discuss common strategies for dealing with the
region's $400 billion foreign debt, Brazil's finance minister said
in an interview published Sunday.
   ``We Latin Americans don't want a confrontation with creditors,
but we don't accept the situation as it is today,'' Finance
Minister, Mailson da Nobrega said in an interview published by Rio's
respected Jornal do Brasil newspaper.
   ``We are trying to pay but we can't continue sending 4-5 percent
of the Gross National Product abroad each year in debt interest
payments. We can't sustain this in the long run,'' he said.
   Da Nobrega said economists from ``all Latin nations'' would meet
in Brazil in late November to prepare for a meeting of Latin
American finance ministers scheduled for Dec. 11-12.
   ``In the United States, the idea is also maturing that without
taking another step in the debt crisis there won't be development in
Latin America,'' da Nobrega told the newspaper. ``We Latin nations
want to act politically to accelerate the adoption of measures that
are in the air. Everyone feels something will happen as early as
next year.''
   Da Nobrega said the Brazilian government's next step in relation
to the country's $121 billion in foreign loans was to reduce the
amount of its outstanding debt.
   In a limited number of cases, this already has been done by
swapping debt for equity in Brazilian businesses.
   ``This is an idea that is maturing and receiving a greater
consensus,'' da Nobrega said. ``We are closely following the
evolution of this idea in academic areas, in some governments and
within certain banks.''
   In September, Brazil signed an accord with creditor banks to
refinance some $80 billion of its debt over 20 years, with an
eight-year grace period. In return, Brazil was to receive $5.2
billion from creditors to help finance interest payments.

<HEAD>Rales Extend Tender Offer, Threaten To Withdraw It After Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investor group waging a $2.7 billion hostile
bid to acquire Interco Inc. said Sunday it was extending its offer
by two days, but threatened to withdraw it if the company continued
refusing to negotiate.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp. extended its $74 a share cash tender
offer, which was to expire at midnight Monday, through midnight
Wednesday.
   The group, headed by the brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales of
Washington, D.C., in a letter to Interco's board of directors also
stated it would terminate the offer if the company had not agreed by
5 p.m. Wednesday to give the group confidential corporate
information or enter into buyout talks.
   Cardinal Acquisition announced last Wednesday that Interco
stockholders had tendered 29.6 million shares under its offer.
Combined with the 3.2 million shares the group already owns, that
would give the Raleses control of 92 percent of Interco's
outstanding shares.
   In its letter, the group contended the only barrier to completion
of a buyout was the company's refusal to withdraw its poison pill
takeover defense.
   Last week, the Delaware Chancery Court enjoined the use of the
defense, but Interco has appealed the decision to the Delaware
Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the appeal on Nov. 30. Interco,
which is based in St. Louis, is incorporated in Delaware.
   A spokesman for the Rales brothers said after the ruling that
they would not purchase any Interco shares until the issue was
resolved in the state Supreme Court.
   Interco also said last Wednesday it would seek a preliminary
injunction against Cardinal's tender offer.
   Interco employs about 54,000 people nationwide and controls such
well-known clothing, furniture and shoe brands as London Fog, Ethan
Allen, Converse and Florsheim. Last year the company reported sales
of $3.34 billion.
   Interco has rebuffed attempts by the Rales brothers since they
first offered to acquire the company for $64 a share in July.
Subsequently, Interco fashioned a restructuring program and moved to
adopt the poison pill, which would make an unwanted takeover
prohibitively expensive.

<HEAD>Fuller Says Financial Markets Misreading `Tea Leaves'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf pvs, bgng: ``Transition co-chief ...'' to
CORRECT to ``tea leaves'' sted ``tea levels.''

   President Reagan said Sunday he does not
believe this week's decline in the stock market ``has anything to do
with George Bush.''
   The head of President-elect Bush's transition team, meanwhile,
sought to calm Wall Street with assurances that Bush sees no reason
to push down the value of the dollar to increase exports.
   Reagan, returning to the White House from a weekend at Camp
David, the presidential hideaway in the mountains of Western
Maryland, was asked why the market dropped after Bush's election on
Tuesday.
   ``I've given up trying to guess why the market does that,'' he
replied. ``I don't think it has anything to do with George Bush.''
   Transition co-chief Craig Fuller said financial markets could be
``misreading some of the tea leaves'' by falling in reaction to
calls for a cheaper dollar by Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers who has advised Bush from time to
time.
   Feldstein said on Wednesday he believes the dollar should be
about 20 percent cheaper in terms of major foreign currencies.
   A cheaper dollar means it takes more of them to buy a German
mark, Japanese yen or other currency. Other things being equal, this
makes U.S. exports cheaper and thus more competitive but at the same
time makes imported goods from cars to textiles more expensive,
adding to inflationary pressures.
   Though Treasury officials said they saw no reason to seek a lower
dollar, the dollar declined on foreign exchange markets in what
traders said was reaction to Feldstein's remarks.
   Reacting in turn to those declines, the Dow-Jones Industrial
Average finished the week at 2067.03, a drop of 78.47 for the week
of which 47.66 came on Friday.
   ``We see no reason to change the policies that are in place right
now with respect to the dollar,'' Fuller said in an appearance on
the NBC-TV show, ``Meet the Press.''
   ``I can tell you (Bush) listens to a lot of people'' on
economics, Fuller said. ``He has not supported what Marty Feldstein
said. It is not the policy of this administration and it is not
going to be the policy of the next administration.''
   On another interview program, Sen. Pete Domenici, D-N.M., senior
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said, ``I am not at all
impressed by the frenzy of Wall Street and the moneychangers. ...
They're running around acting as if some living human being could
have solved this problem _ the deficit _ in 10 days.''
   ``I think it will get solved about July or August,'' Domenici
said on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''
   Fuller said, ``What the markets need to know is that George Bush
is committed to what he talked about during the campaign and that is
to get spending under control and reduce the size of this deficit.''
   To that end, he said, Bush's first priority is the appointment of
economic officials to prepare for discussions with Congress on how
to reduce the deficit. The projected $132 billion deficit will have
to be cut by $32 billion in the next budget, as called for by the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law.
   Bush campaigned on a ``read my lips _ no new taxes'' slogan, and
Fuller said, ``That's what he'll say in January.''
   ``He will sit down with the Congress and try to find a way to
bring this deficit down by not increasing peoples' taxes,'' Fuller
said.
   But ``there's no question revenues must be a part'' of any budget
solution, Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., a candidate for Senate
majority leader, said on the ABC-TV show,, ``This Week With David
Brinkley,''
   ``That's not a question of philosophy. That's a question of
mathematics,'' Johnston said.
   Transition co-director Robert Teeter, also on the Brinkley show,
said, ``There have been big increases in (discretionary spending)
over the past 20 years. They have not been pulled down,'' even in
the budget tightness of the Reagan years.
   As possible cuts, Domenici mentioned the $2 billion in annual
subsidies for the Export-Import Bank, $80 million for the
Appalachian Regional Commission, $450 million in regional economic
development programs and as much as $1 billion in subsidies to
Amtrak and mass transit.
   Appearing with Domenici, Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the House
majority leader, said those cuts could be ``important'' but ``not
obviously sufficient to deal with what's in the deficit.''
   ``If George Bush, as president of the United States, wants to
say, `No new taxes,' there will be no new taxes,'' Foley said.
   ``The Democrats are not going to go pounding on the door begging
the president to change his mind on that and raise taxes. Nor are we
going to push legislation toward him so he can veto it.''
