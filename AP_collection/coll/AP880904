   The fifth tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season lost its strength as it raced towards Portugal's Azores
island chain, and its remnants were absorbed by a large north
Atlantic storm system Sunday.
   Tropical Storm Ernesto, located roughly 400 miles north of the
Azores near latitude 45.0 north at longitude 28.0 west, could no
longer be identified late Sunday, according to a 10:30 p.m.
advisory from the National Hurricane Center.
   Earlier in the evening, the storm had top sustained winds of 40
mph and was racing northeastward toward the Azores at about 50 mph.
   The Civil Protection Service on the islands monitored the storm
but chose to not warn residents Sunday evening, said Azores
Regional Government spokesman Jose Manuel Baiao.
   Meteorologist Martin Nelson of the Hurricane Center said Ernesto
probably would lose strength when it moved over colder water.
   ``The storm draws its strength from the warm, moist tropical
water,'' he said. ``Even a few degrees can affect the storm.''
   Tropical storms have wind of at least 39 mph rotating around a
warm core of low pressure. If sustained wind reaches 74 mph, the
system is upgraded to a hurricane. If wind drops below 39 mph, it
is downgraded to a tropical depression.
   On Saturday, storm warnings for the Gulf coast from Cameron,
La., to Apalachicola, Fla., were canceled after a tropical
depression dissipated several hours after forming off the Texas
coast.
   The first hurricane of the season, Debby, swirled to life Friday
but was downgraded to a tropical storm hours later after moving
inland at Tuxpan, Mexico, about 165 miles northeast of Mexico City.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<NOTE>Eds: Inserts one graf after 5th graf, ``Doctors there'' to UPDATE

to the head and the chest wall.''</NOTE>

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson suffered
what doctors called a slight head injury in an automobile accident
Sunday near his training camp.
   Tyson's car apparently skidded on a wet road about 11:20 a.m.,
said a spokesman for the boxer, Dan Klores. Tyson's car was the
only vehicle involved and the accident was not reported to
authorities, said Klores, who gave no other details.
   A state police trooper said the accident was not under
investigation. If the injuries and damage were only to Tyson and
his property, then he has 10 days to report the accident to the
state Department of Motor Vehicles, the trooper said.
   Tyson, who was recuperating from a broken bone in his right hand
suffered in a street fight two weeks ago with heavyweight Mitch
Green, was taken to a Catskill hospital and then transferred to
Columbia Green Medical Center in nearby Hudson, where he was listed
in stable condition early Sunday evening.
   Doctors there decided Tyson should have additional neurological
tests, and Tyson was transferred Sunday night to a New York City
hospital associated with Columbia University's medical school, said
Anne Grebert, a spokeswoman at the hospital in Hudson.
   Dr. Carolyn Britton, assistant professor of nuerology at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York said late Sunday,
``He suffered minor trauma to the head and the chest wall.
Currently he's in the hospital for observation and to undergo
diagnostic tests. His condition is quite stable. He's
neurologically normal.''
   He arrived in New York shortly after 9 p.m. His wife, actress
Robin Givens, was in the back of the ambulance with Tyson and tried
to put a sheet over the windows to keep camera crews from
photographing her husband.
   A few moments later, Tyson was wheeled into the hospital on a
stretcher with a sheet over his body and a towel over his face.
   As cameramen pressed forward, Givens pushed them back, shouting,
``Give him a break.''
   Tyson, whose championship bout against British champ Frank Bruno
was recently postponed until Oct. 22 because of the hand injury,
was scheduled to accompany his wife to the Soviet Union on
Wednesday.
   Green, who lost to the undefeated Tyson on May 20, 1986, in a
10-round decision, had the bridge of his nose split by Tyson in the
early-morning incident outside an all-night clothing boutique.
   Tyson claimed Green was harassing him about their meeting in the
ring. Tyson said he reacted to Green by instinct.
   In his last fight in the ring on June 27, Tyson knocked out
previously unbeaten Michael Spinks in 91 seconds, earning $22
million.

   Emergency crews worked Sunday to find shelter
for 50,000 people left homeless after two tropical storms whipped
through coastal areas of both eastern and western Mexico, killing
at least 10 people, authorities said.
   Rain from the storms continued to drench parts of the country
and many areas were without power or communications.
   Mud and rock loosened from hillsides by the days of rain blocked
numerous roads, officials in several states said.
   ``There is a lot of damage and at least eight neighborhoods are
badly hurt,'' Javier del Porte, a public works official, said by
telephone from Tapachula in the southernmost state of Chiapas on
the Pacific coast.
   Authorities said 30,000 were forced to flee their homes after
Hurricane Debby, subsequently downgraded to tropical storm status,
hit the Gulf of Mexico coast on Friday.
   Most of the evacutions were in state of Veracruz, state
government spokesman Raul Torres said.Three people died when
mudslides crushed two houses in Papantla, 16 miles from the Gulf of
Mexico, and three storm-related deaths were reported in Poza Rica,
he said.
   The towns, on the coast about 150 miles northeast of Mexico
City, were in the region that bore the brunt of the storm.
   Four others perished and 16 were injured when a mudslide crushed
three houses in the mountain community of Ixtlahuaco, about 100
miles northeast of Mexico City, said Florencio Gutierrez Hernandez
of the State Public Security office.
   About 20,000 people were evacuated Saturday in Chiapas to avoid
the brunt of tropical storm Kristy, according to the government
news agency Notimex said.
   Debby was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season and the fourth named storm.

<HEAD>Zia's Death Could Slow Development Of Koranic Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of President Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq could slow the spread of Islamic law in Pakistan, a cause he
fervently advanced during 11 years as this Moslem country's leader.
   Zia, an army general who died Aug. 17 in a plane crash, had made
the ``Islamization'' of Pakistani society a pillar of his policy.
   But he faced opposition from some politicians, members of the
middle class and others. With his death, the fate of a further
expansion of Islamic law in Pakistan is in doubt.
   Islamic law is interpreted with different stringency from one
Islamic nation to another. Zia's Islamic laws included a ban on the
consumption of alcohol, the provision of flogging and stoning as
punishment for such crimes as drinking and adultery, and a 2.5
percent tax on the rich to help the poor.
   Zia failed, however, to codify into Pakistani law Islam's
opposition to collecting interest payments on loans. Punishment by
flogging was rare, despite its presence in the legal code, and
there were no stonings.
   Zia was the most enthusiastic of all of Pakistan's recent rulers
in applying Islamic law, said Professor Mahmood Ahmad Ghazi, a
leading scholar at the International Islamic University in
Islamabad and the man who led prayers at Zia's funeral.
   If ``someone not as enthusiastic as Zia'' takes over, Ghazi
said, the pace of Islamization will be slow in this 98 percent
Moslem nation.
   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the new president of Pakistan, and his
caretaker Cabinet met a week after Zia's death and pledged to
continue Islamization. But nationwide elections are scheduled for
Nov. 16, and that could strongly affect government policy.
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, who could become prime
minister if her party wins the elections, has spoken out strongly
against Zia's brand of Islamization, saying no one should impose
personal religious views on the country.
   ``There are some parties that are enthusiastic, and there are
some parties that are lukewarm,'' Ghazi said.
   In May, Zia dissolved parliament, citing corruption, laxity and
lawmakers' failure to promote Islamic law over a three-year period
as justification for his move.
   He then issued a presidential order in June that decreed the
legal code of Islam to be the supreme law of Pakistan and expanded
court powers to review laws for conformity with the Koran, the
Moslem holy book.
   Ms. Bhutto was quoted at time as saying that ``Islam, like in
the past, is again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule.''
   Zia said the decree would not affect the rights of non-Moslems,
or the country's business contracts with other nations.
   The order expires later this year unless reaffirmed by the
government.
   Defining the relationship between Islam and the country's legal
system has been a central question since 1947, when Pakistan was
created as a home for Moslems on the Indian subcontinent.
   Many Islamic principles were enshrined in law before Zia came to
power. But he sought to expand these dramatically, giving courts
constitutional power to determine whether laws conformed to the
Koran and the traditions of the Prophet Mohammed.
   Laws dealing with the constitution itself, judicial procedure
and fiscal and personal matters were excluded from the review at
first, but some of these exemptions were removed by Zia's June
decree.
   Although special courts now review laws for compliance with
Islamic tradition, final appeals still go to civil high courts
rather than to the legal bodies of religious scholars that exist in
some other Moslem states.
   Many groups _ including much of the middle class and many
lawyers and educated women _ have opposed Islamization, believing
the country should not turn its back on educational and legal
traditions from the West that have been in place since the British
colonial era.
   Zia's policy also was coolly received by Moslems with different
interpretations of Islamic law. For example, the jurisprudence of
the Shiite sect, which constitutes about 5 percent of the country's
107 million people, differs significantly from that of the majority
Sunnis.

<HEAD>Last Survivor Of Last U.S. Indian Massacre Looks Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last survivor of what many historians
regard as the last massacre of Indians in U.S. history thinks
returning to the site after more than seven decades may finally
bring the scope of the tragedy home to her.
   ``It would be strange because I feel like I stand off from all
of it,'' said Mary Jo Estepp, who was an 18-month-old child when
taken from her dead mother's back after the ambush in Nevada in
1911. ``It's in the distance, you know.''
   Though she is now making plans for the visit with friends, she
lived most of her 78 or so years with only an outline of her past.
Many details were finally supplied a few years ago by the author of
a book about her grandfather, an Indian named Shoshone Mike who
refused to live on a reservation.
   The ambush, by a white posse, left Mike and seven other Indians
dead in the snow near Winnemucca, Nev., on Feb. 26, 1911, 21 years
after the last major Indian massacre, at Wounded Knee, S.D.
   According to researchers, Shoshone Mike refused to settle on the
Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho and instead roamed the
mountains near Twin Falls with his sons, daughters and
grandchildren.
   The Indians lived off the land and worked for farmers, living in
peace.
   But in 1910 one of Mike's sons was killed by a white horse
thief, and the family retaliated by killing the killer. Not
trusting white justice, Shoshone Mike took his family and fled into
Nevada.
   The 12 Indians survived a brutal winter by stealing cattle for
food. When four ranchers discovered the loss, the Indians killed
them and took their horses.
   Posses from Nevada and California pursued the Indians for 300
miles until Feb. 26, when they caught the ragged band sleeping and
slaughtered four men, two women and two boys during a brief battle.
One posse member was killed.
   The four surviving children were put in the Reno, Nev., jail
because there was no place else to put them.
   In his 1973 book about Shoshone Mike, titled ``The Last Free
Man,'' author Dayton Hyde noted the four surviving children, but he
was unable to find out what happened to them.
   A friend of Ms. Estep contacted Hyde after reading his book, and
Hyde traveled to her home in Yakima.
   There is still much Ms. Estep doesn't know about the time before
she was lifted from that blood-soaked cradleboard after falling
face-down in the snow. The identity of her father is unclear, as is
her age and whether she was born a Shoshone or a Bannock Indian.
   Still, she said, ``They know my mother was one of Shoshone
Mike's daughters. Her name was Snake.''
   The massacre in Nevada appears to have been the last of its kind
in the United States, said Frank Bergon, a professor of Native
American cultures at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., whose
novel, ``Shoshone Mike,'' was recently published by Viking. Hyde
agrees.
   Many massacres of whites and Indians occurred in the 19th
century. ``What makes this significant is it occurred in 1911, when
there were automobiles, airplanes and movies,'' Bergon said. ``The
fact that it did occur in the 20th century makes the whole thing
surreal.''
   After the massacre, the federal government ordered Evan Estep,
then the superintendent of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, to
pick up the children.
   Ms. Estep's memories begin with the train trip north in November
1911.
   ``I remember when we went to the dining car I wouldn't eat the
food,'' she said. The exception was raisins in the raisin bread,
which tided her over. They may have reminded her of food her family
ate, but she isn't sure.
   The other three children died of illnesses within a year. The
toddler survived tuberculosis and was adopted by Estep and his
wife, Rita, who were childless. They guessed she was about 18
months old when she was found.
   She moved with the family to reservations in Montana and New
Mexico, finally settling at Toppenish on the Yakima Indian
Reservation in 1924.
   Although her adoptive parents told her about the massacre, she
never asked for details and they never talked much about Shoshone
Mike, she said. She was treated as a white person and noted, ``Most
of my friends are non-Indians.''
   The family moved to Yakima in 1930, after Estep retired. Ms.
Estep still lives in the house purchased by her adoptive parents,
who died in the 1950s.
   She graduated from Central Washington University with a music
degree and spent 40 years teaching school before retiring in 1974.
She never married.
   Her only tangible link with her Indian past is a single
black-and-white photograph of the four surviving children taken in
front of the Reno jail.
   It shows the children she had thought were siblings until Hyde
identified them: an aunt, Hattie, age about 4; an uncle, Cleveland,
about 7; and another aunt, Heney, who appears to be about 18.
   And, of course, the haunting photo shows herself, wearing a
white hat and crying.

<HEAD>Forecasters Say Hurricane Winds No Longer Pose Threat to Hawaii</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A tropical storm watch for the Hawaiian islands
was discontinued but high surf advisories were in effect as
Hurricane Uleki moved away from the state, the National Weather
Service said.
   At 2 p.m. Sunday, or 8 p.m. EDT, the hurricane was 385 miles
southwest of Honolulu and 350 miles southwest of Lihue, Kauai,
moving to the west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph
and gusts to 100 mph, meteorologist Clarence Lee said.
   Uleki's westward movement lessened the threat of damaging winds
for Oahu, where Honolulu is located, Kauai and Niihau, Lee said.
   However, a high surf advisory remained in effect for all
southern coasts that were pounded by large waves from the storm.
   Rescuers assisted 19 people Saturday in 5- to 6-foot waves off
Waikiki Beach and nearby Ala Moana Beach, according to lifeguard
Capt. Jim Howe.
   A body was discovered Sunday off Maunalua Bay eight miles east
of Honolulu, but it was not immediately known if the death was
related to the storm, police said.
   Uleki was expected to continue moving westward, and gradually
weaken to the point where it could be downgraded from hurricane
status this afternoon, Lee said.
   When the storm took an unexpected turn toward the islands
Friday, winds near the center gusted to 150 mph.
   Uleki is Hawaiian for Ulysses. The weather service in Hawaii
said the Central Pacific region has its own list of Hawaiian names
for storms in the region. Next will be Wila, followed by Aka, Ekeka
and Hale.
   So few storms originate in the region that the list is used over
and over, and does not start the year with a name beginning with
the letter A as in the Atlantic or other regions of the Pacific.

   Utility crews finally restored service Saturday
night to parts of a 50-block downtown section that had been without
electricity since the middle of the week.
   But Seattle City Light officials asked customers not to turn on
their air conditioning immediately, out of fear of a surge of
demand on one of the hottest days of the year. The temperature in
Seattle hit 92 degrees, a record for the date, the National Weather
Service said.
   About half of the blacked-out area's customers got electricity
back when four cables feeding power to the area were reactivated
about 6:45 p.m. PDT, power company spokesman Jim Aguirre said.
   All the customers were expected to be back on line when two
other feeder cables are repaired and in place Sunday or Monday,
Aguirre said. Restrictions on power use also were expected to end
then, he said.
   An initial attempt to energize the cables was unsuccessful when
one of them refused to take power and tripped a circuit breaker.
The reason for the problem was not immediately known, Aguirre said.
   Earlier in the day, the outage had officials worried about fires
and the effect of the heat on the elderly.
   ``We're keeping an eye on the heat situation, and we're on alert
to evacuate people'' from housing for the elderly, said Hope
Tuttle, Seattle-King County Red Cross spokeswoman.
   The high temperature Friday at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport was a September record of 98, one degree below the all-time
record for that recording station, and a similar reading was
forecast Saturday.
   Since power was lost in a transformer fire Wednesday, the Red
Cross had been serving three meals a day to 150 to 250 elderly
residents. Volunteers had to take some meals up 13 flights of
stairs in buildings where elevators were inoperative.
   Street lights, but almost no traffic signals, came on for the
first time Friday night when temporary overhead wiring was hooked
into the lighting system.
   Repair crews hoped to begin restoring power late Saturday in a
complex process that would ``likely extend into Monday,'' said City
Light spokesman Scott Forslund.
   Thirty buildings with the largest loads in the area and more
than 90 others with emergency generators would remain off the
system when power is restored, Forslund said.
   When the switch is thrown, City Light engineers plan to wait two
to four hours to assure that the system is stabilized before
restoring service to the remaining buildings. The area typically
accounts for roughly 3 percent of the city's 1,000-megawatt load.
   If too much equipment is turned on when the switch is thrown,
the sudden added load would cause an abrupt voltage dip, or sag,
said Hugh McIntosh, chief spokesman for City Light.
   ``It would be like halftime during a ball game when everyone
flushes all the toilets and the water pressure drops,'' he said.
   A severe sag could trip current-monitoring equipment and trigger
another blackout.
   Roy Davis, spokesman for the Fire Department, estimated 90
percent of the affected businesses were closed.
   An office of Great Northwest Federal Savings and Loan remained
open, but with reduced operations. Customers' identifications were
checked before they were let into the building, two at a time, to
withdraw money for the weekend.
   ``This is banking the way it used to be,'' said Dianne Backus,
division manager. ``We're taking down every transaction by hand and
every couple of hours run to one of our branches and enter
everything into the computer.''
   Fire alarm systems were checked regularly, as were residential
hotels where officials feared guests might use candles or gas
camping stoves.
   ``Frankly, this situation is new to us, and we're a little
nervous,'' said Davis. ``We've got several cars patrolling just to
look for fires.''
   No injuries were reported during the blackout, and heavy police
patrols were credited with preventing break-ins.
   By Friday many hotel guests had wearied of the novelty of being
issued complimentary flashlights and complained of 15-story climbs
up stairways.
   ``I began to notice a little soreness in my calves yesterday,''
said Janet Hardin of Eaton, Ohio, a guest at the 40-story Westin
Hotel's south tower, which had one of three elevators in service.
   Westin officials tried to accommodate most guests in the hotel's
47-story north tower, which had air conditioning.
   It was another matter entirely for Viola Davis, 83, pausing on
the ninth-floor landing in the Security House, two floors from
where she lives.
   ``I stop ... every floor ... and rest,'' she panted. ``Have to
or I can't make it. Takes me half an hour to get up.
   ``It's horrible, but some of my neighbors haven't been out of
their apartments all week.''

<HEAD>Artistic Leader of Fluxus Movement Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Watts, a leader of the Fluxus Group
known for creating public art events in New York City during the
1960s, died Friday. He was 65.
   Watts died at his farm in Martins Creek after a long bout with
lung cancer, according to a longtime friend and former student,
Larry Miller. Watts was planning a solo exhibition of his recent
work at the time of his death, Miller said.
   Watts' mixed media works appeared in museums and galleries in
the United States, Canada and Europe.
   In 1946, Watts painted in the tradition of abstract
expressionism, but 12 years later, he stopped painting and began
working with a variety of media, including sculpture, film, video
and performance work.
   In the early 1960s, he was one of the artistic leaders of the
Fluxus Group, a collection of avant-garde artists whose works often
consisted of creating public events, including melting a block of
ice on a street corner. It was described by its founder, the late
George Maciunas, as ``a fusion of Spike Jones, vaudeville, gags,
children's games and Duchamp.''
   Art historian Barbara Moore of New York City said the Fluxus
Group was an important influence on the popularity of
anti-establishment forms in art of all types. The Fluxists, in
turn, were heavily influenced by the Dadaists and musician-composer
John Cage.
   At the time of his death, Watts also was developing
silk-screened works and porkchop tables with art dealer Francesco
Conz, of Verona, Italy, Miller said. In addition, Watts was working
with ``flux-med,'' silk-screened images dealing with medical
procedures, and had produced a portfolio of notes and sketches from
his work in 1964-66.
   He was an art professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey from
1953-84, and was the school's resident artist in film and mixed
media from 1964-82. Watts also taught at the Institute of Applied
Arts and Sciences in Brooklyn from 1951-52.

<HEAD>Police Say Man Arrested At Airport Made Threats Against Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested a man who allegedly
tried to carry a gun onto an airplane and made threats against Vice
President George Bush, authorities said Saturday.
   The man, from Springfield, was being held in a psychiatric
institution and was undergoing evaluation after his arrest Friday,
police said.
   The man had not been formally charged, but was being held on
suspicion of unlawful use of a weapon. He allegedly tried to carry
a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol through a metal detector at the
Springfield Regional Airport.
   Police said the man made threats against Bush as he was being
arrested.
   The Springfield News-Leader reported in its Sunday editions that
the man was traveling to Los Angeles, where Bush has scheduled
campaign appearances on Monday. The plane he attempted to board was
bound for Dallas, and he planned to take a connecting flight to Los
Angeles, the newspaper reported.
   Police would not comment further about the case and referred

Service, where a duty officer said he could not provide details
because local police handled the investigation.

   A cruise ship that became stuck in
arctic ice late last week during an educational journey for
intellectuals canceled a call for help from an icebreaker on
Saturday, the Coast Guard said.
   The Society Explorer, with 149 passengers and crew members,
reported it was in no danger because of the ice and had moved close
to Canadian waters, said John Baker, a Coast Guard spokesman in
Juneau. The ship notified Canadian maritime officials on Wednesday
it was trapped.
   ``It looks like they're free of the ice, they're moving and they
have said they no longer need assistance,'' Baker said.
   A 399-foot Coast Guard icebreaker had been en route Saturday to
assist the ship as well an oil-research support ship stranded in
ice. The research vessel, which had called for assistance Friday,
continued to await help Saturday.
   The Coast Guard had said the 236-foot ocean liner was caught in
Beaufort Sea ice 50 miles northeast of Point Barrow, or about 400
miles above the Arctic Circle.
   The liner, bound for the Northwest Passage, is operated by
Society Expeditions Cruises of Seattle, which specializes in
journeys to unconventional destinations, including Antarctica, and
emphasizes libraries and lectures.
   Some of the passengers aboard the Society Explorer have been
using the time to float in rafts routinely used for picture-taking
trips and other activities.
   ``Our entertainment on board is mostly intellectual
entertainment, not gambling and dancing,'' Peter Cox, planning
director for the cruise operator, said late last week.
   He said the ship is ``absolutely safe'' and well-stocked with
items on its continental menu.
   The cruise operator said it expects the Society Explorer to
arrive on time at its destination off the southern coast of
Newfoundland at the end of September.

<HEAD>Chemical Spill Causes Evacuation of 500; 300 from Nursing Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 500 people, including more than
300 from a nursing home, were evacuated Saturday after a tank truck
carrying a hazardous chemical tipped over, releasing the chemical
which formed a noxious cloud, officials said.
   No serious injuries were reported, but two men near the truck
were taken to a hospital, complaining of burning eyes and chests
after inhaling the chemical, phosphorus trichloride.
   The tanker tipped over about 6 p.m. Saturday when it sank into
the rain-soaked ground of an unpaved parking lot near U.S. Highway
78. Further details about the incident were unavailable, officials
said.
   The cloud hung over the city's north end, authorities said.
   The men were in good condition, said Trident Regional Medical
Center nursing supervisor Jan Pfennig.
   The evacuation included 15 to 20 workers of Presbyterian Home of
South Carolina and its 320 residents, some of whom were removed in
stretchers.
   Evacuees were taken to Summerville Elementary School and the
South Carolina Marine and Wildlife Resources Coastal Center, about
six miles away.
   Authorities said they didn't know how much of the chemical had
leaked out.
   Phosphorus trichloride is a clear, colorless, fuming liquid used
chiefly in organic synthesis as a chlorinating agent.
   When it comes in contact with moisture, it forms a compound
similar to an acid, according to Dr. Bruce Metts, director of the
Palmetto Poison Center in Columbia. It can irritate the eyes and
the mucous membranes of the respiratory system, Metts said.

   A newly formed tropical depression dissipated
several hours after it sprang from an area of disturbed weather off
the Texas coast as a tropical storm churned in the Atlantic,
forecasters said Saturday.
   An Air Force aircraft was unable to identify any center of
circulation with the depression and all warnings along the Gulf
coast were discontinued.
   Meantime, a depression in the Atlantic some 800 miles northeast
of Bermuda became Tropical Storm Ernesto, according to a 6 p.m. EDT
advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center. The storm was
moving north-northeast.
   Tropical storm warnings issued at 5 p.m. CDT Saturday from
Cameron, La., to Apalachicola were discontinued by late evening,
according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center.
   The Atlantic storm was moving at 30 mph, and mainly posed a
concern at sea, hurricane specialist Bob Case said. Gradual
strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours.
   ``It appears it is going to get some help with the colder air
temperatures north of it ... and just become a big storm in the
Atlantic,'' he said.
   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes pack winds of at least 74
mph.
   The first hurricane of the season, Debby, was downgraded Friday
to a tropical storm after moving inland at Tuxpan, Mexico, about
165 miles northeast of Mexico City.
   The hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Four men died Saturday night when
their single-engine plane crashed while taking off from Grand
Canyon Airport, officials said.
   The Cessna 172 stalled shortly after takeoff and the aircraft
spun out of control, crashing about 100 yards north of the runway,
said Ron Warren, a spokesman for Grand Canyon Airlines, which is
based at the airport. There were no survivors.
   The plane had to abort its first takeoff attempt because it had
taken on too much fuel, said Chuck Daehler, who is with Grand
Canyon Helicopters.
   The initial attempt was at 6:20 p.m, Warren said. The pilot
radioed the control tower that there was too much fuel on board and
then returned to the airport, he said.
   ``They tried to spend the night, but everything in town was
full,'' Warren said.
   The plane then made a second attempt after draining the excess
fuel but the plane crashed just after 9 p.m., Daehler said. The
airport runway is about 10 miles south of the canyon's south rim.
   The victims were all men in their mid-20s from Rustin, La.,
Warren said. Their identities were not immediately available.

   Monsoon floods have marooned an
estimated 20 million people across Bangladesh, officials said
Sunday. Forty more people died in the deluge, bringing the death
toll to 882, a newspaper reported.
   ``Shortage of medicine, cooked food and drinking water is
causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' said an
official at the Relief Ministry in Dhaka.
   Rains battered Dhaka on Sunday, where an estimated 500,000
people have taken shelter from adjoining low-lying areas. Their
presence and uncertainities over the floods caused prices of goods
to rise in the city. Prices for rice, a staple, have risen 40
percent.
   The capital remained cut off for the third day Sunday as more
areas of the runways at the international airport were submerged.
   Relief officials were unable to reach many interior areas where
people were feared trapped with meager or no food and potable
water, officials from four areas told The Associated Press by
telephone. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They estimated that 20 million people were marooned in 50 of the
country's 64 districts that were battered by the floods.
   The government issued new appeals for boats, helicopters and 3
million tons of food to combat the deluge.
   The Sangbad newspaper said 40 people died across the country on
Saturday, taking the total death toll in the current monsson floods
that began in June to at least 882. The government toll, considered
understated, stood at 300.
   In Dhaka, several gas stations closed their pumps and hung ``No
Gas'' signs.
   ``Unless to get fresh supplies the pumps will remain closed,''
said one station owner, Giasuddin Ahmed.
   Annual floods are common in Bangladesh, one of the poorest
countries in the world. At least 1,500 people died in floods last
year. In 1985, more than 10,000 people were killed when cyclones
and tidal waves hit low islands in the Bay of Bengal, about 130
miles south of Dhaka.

   An ex-policeman convicted of participating in a
pension fund scandal ended a 15-hour hostage ordeal by releasing
the man who had exposed the scam, police said.
   Anthony D. Daniele, 39, remained on the 15th floor of the office
building where he had held John Frank, vice president of the city
police board, said police spokeswoman Linda Hancock.
   Daniele, who was armed with an unidentified weapon, had held no
other hostages. He let Frank go about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. Frank
apparently was unharmed, police said.
   A hostage-response team and dozens of officers who had
surrounded the building continued to negotiate with Daniele through
the early morning hours, Hancock said.
   ``Right now they're still talking with him about the possibility
of his coming out and ending the whole thing,'' she said.
   ``We're just talking,'' said Lt. Col. Calzona Hall at an earlier
briefing as the ordeal passed the 12-hour mark. ``He's been very
cooperative.''
   The incident began at 10:30 a.m.
   Hancock said Daniele earlier had demanded to make a statement
over St. Louis radio station KMOX-AM.
   Besides an eight-year term, Daniele was ordered to make
restitution of $200,000.
   Frank, a lawyer and a member of the appointed civilian board
that administers the Police Department, exposed the kickback
scandal that cost police and fire pension funds an estimated
$333,000.
   The scam was carried out by paying a brokerage artificially high
commissions on stock transactions that were made with pension
funds, prosecutors said. Participants in the scheme were then given
back part of the money.
   Daniele, who headed the police pension fund, was the only one of
six men indicted in the scam to stand trial. He was convicted of
charges that included extortion, conspiracy and mail fraud, and
could have received as much as 32 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   A British container ship and a British
destroyer accompanying it toward the Persian Gulf collided, poking
a hole in the warship and injuring 11 of its crewmen, officials
said.
   British naval sources in Oman said the accident occurred
Saturday night when the HMS Southampton and the British-registered
Tor Bay were 15 miles off the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah
on the Gulf of Oman.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonoymity, said the
Southampton sailed on to Fujairah after a brief stop to assess its
damage. During that stop, the 4,000-ton ship appeared ``badly
holed'' and was ``seriously flooding,'' they said.
   But the sources said the situation was under control.
   The 34,477-ton Tor Bay, which was on its way from Singapore to
Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, escaped with only minor damage
to its bow and continued its voyage after the accident. Its owners,
P and O of London, said it would be repaired at Dubai.
   The Defense Ministry in London said 11 crewmen were injured _
three of them with broken bones, one suffering shock and the other
seven with minor cuts and bruises.
   On arrival at Fujairah, the sailors with broken bones were moved
to the local government hospital. One witness at the port said the
Southampton was ``damaged extensively. ... (there's) a big gash on
its port side, bigger than the size of a car.''
   The Southampton has a 253-man crew. It came to the Persian Gulf
region to join the Royal Navy patrolling units last month.
   The sources said they could not tell how the collision occurred,
especially that warships usually sail at least one mile away from
the vessels they are escorting in the gulf.
   The Southampton is one of two Royal Navy destroyers and a
frigate that accompany merchant ships into and out of the gulf
because of the 8-year-old Iraq-Iran conflict. There also are three
British mine sweepers and three support vessels, including the Olna
and Diligence, the sources added.
   A cease-fire began in the Iraq-Iran war Aug. 20.

   Young men on Sunday hurled
gasoline and acid bombs at British soldiers as they tried to defuse
a 300-pound bomb, but police drove off the assailants and the job
was completed safely.
   Two men were detained for questioning, and a police officer
received medical treatment after ammonia was thrown into his eyes,
said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's
police force.
   The confrontation occurred in the mainly Roman Catholic New
Lodge area of north Belfast, where authorities found the bomb in a
parked, stolen car along with several other detonators and timing
devices. Sixty homes in the area were evacuated until the bomb was
defused about 6 a.m.
   Police fired plastic bullets at the young men who attempted to
disrupt the work of the bomb disposal experts by throwing ``petrol
bombs, acids bombs and other assorted missiles,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for planting the bomb,
but the police spokesman said there was ``a rather strong
possibility'' it was the work of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The IRA is fighting a guerrilla war to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the mostly Protestant province with the
mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Moslem rebels Sunday released
seven civilians, including the wife and daughter of an American,
who were abducted a week ago in Basilan province near this southern
city, the military reported.
   The captives were freed at dawn in Sampinit village and brought
to the house of Basilan Gov. Gerry Salapuddin, who negotiated with
local Moslem rebel leader Rashid Kasim for their release, a
military report said.
   It was not immediately known if any of the victims paid the
$50,000 ransom the kidnappers had demanded for each of them. Among
those released were Myrna Cawley, wife of American physician George
Cawley, and their daughter Catherine.
   The seven were among 11 civilians abducted by the rebels in an
ambush of three vehicles in Lamitan on Aug. 27.
   The rebels allowed 39 other people in the vehicles to go free.
Four of the kidnap victims were released Tuesday after their
relatives paid the rebels an undisclosed sum of money, the military
said.

   For the first time since Korea was

port.
   A Soviet tourist ship, the 12,798-ton Mikhail Sholokhov, arrived
at the western port city of Inchon, 25 miles west of Seoul. The
ship went to Inchon after stopping at the southern port of Pusan on
Saturday.
   In Pusan, the venue for yachting competition in the Olympics,
the ship dropped off a 27-member Soviet yachting delegation and 56
tourists.
   The Soviet vessel will remain in Inchon until the end of the
Games, held from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   The last visit of a Soviet vessel occurred in 1945, when U.S.
and Soviet troops facilitated the surrender of Japan, which
colonized the peninsula for 36 years. Seoul has no diplomatic
relations with Moscow, which backed North Korea during the
1950-1953 Korean War.

   A cargo ship suspected of carrying drugs
surrendered to British customs officials after it was chased across
the English Channel by French authorities who fired warning shots
when it refused to stop.
   A British customs spokesman identified the vessel as the
Honduras-registered Salton Sea and said it failed to stop for a
routine check by French customs officials off Boulogne on the
northeast French coast late Saturday.
   ``The French fired two shots across her bows and she then did a
bunk (steamed away) into British waters,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   After a chase 40 miles across the English Channel, the freighter
surrendered to the unarmed British coast guard cutter Swift and was
escorted into Ramsgate on the southeast coast of England.
   Customs officers, specially trained dogs and divers were
searching the vessel Sunday. British news reports said the ship was
thought to be carrying illegal drugs, but the Customs and Excise
Department would not comment.
   Bruce Davies, an assistant collector for the Customs and Excise
Department, said no further information would be disclosed about
the ship until it was fully searched, a job that was not expected
to be completed Sunday.
   ``It is a pretty big ship and it is going to take a lot of
rummaging,'' Davies said. ``It is a long hard job and we will be at
it for some while.''
   Kent County Constabulary in Ramsgate said two men were taken off
the ship and held in the town's police cells before being
transferred Sunday to the police station in nearby Dover.
   About 30 British customs officers, some carrying bolt cutters
and electronic equipment, boarded the ship, accompanied by two dogs
trained to sniff for illegal drugs. Two divers disappeared under
the ship, anchored 50 yards from the outer harbor wall.
   The British cutter and the French clipper Vent D'Avac, which
fired the warning shots, were docked nearby.
   The spokesman said he did not know the freighter's destination,
but he said it had come from South America.
   The Salton Sea is not listed in Lloyd's Register of Ships. But
Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said the vague
outline of ``Salton Seahorse, Virgo City, La.'' could be seen on
the ship.
   A ship called the Salton Seahorse is listed in Lloyd's as being
owned by Seahorse Fleet Inc. of Morgan City, La. That ship, built
in 1973 by the American Marine Corp. of New Orleans, is a
170-foot-long supply ship.

   Iraq used song and poetry to mark the
eighth anniversary of the Persian Gulf war on Sunday, a date chosen
to underscore its claim that Iran started the conflict.
   The week-long celebration of ``Saddam's Qadissiyeh'' _ an Iraqi
term for the war _ marks the anniversary of Iranian shelling of
Iraqi territory that Iraq claims began the fighting on Sept. 4.
   Iran dates the war's beginning 18 days later, when Iraqi troops
invaded Iran. The United Nations cease-fire resolution accepted by
both sides calls for an independent body to determine who began the
war.
   The armed forces newspaper Al-Qadissiyeh said in an editorial
that the anniversary ``has become an immortal event in our history
so that coming generations will not forget the Persians'
(Iranians') aggression and evil intentions against Arabs and
Islam.''
   Banners strung in the streets by the ruling Baath Party and
poems read over state television heaped praise on President Saddam
Hussein.
   ``Through the great leader and the great people, victory and
peace have been achieved,'' read one banner.
   ``Oh Saddam, thou art the voice of history,'' a poet pronounced
on television. ``Thou art the only hero at a time when there is no
one else to confront (the foe).
   ``Thou hast brought back to Baghdad and Babylon their glory.''
   Official newspapers hammered at the themes of Iraq's stand at
the U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Iran in Geneva, and accused
Iran of violating the cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20.
   They also blasted Iran's insistence on returning to a southern
border line established by the 1975 Algiers agreement _ the middle
of the Shatt Al-Arab waterway. Iraq has renounced the pact, saying
it wants all of the waterway.
   Saad al-Bazaz, director-general of the official Iraqi News
Agency, wrote in the Baath Party daily Al-Thawra that before the
war, ``Iran violated two important elements of the 1975 Algiers
agreement and chose only one to its benefit.''
   He said Iran refused to return land along the central border as
the treaty demanded and failed to respect ``the principle of
non-interference in internal affairs.''
   Iranian support for Iraqi Kurdish rebels before the war had
aggravated tensions between the neighboring states.
   Iraq dates the war to Sept. 4, 1980, when Iran shelled Iraqi
towns on the central border after months of escalating propaganda
claims by both sides.
   Iraq also accuses Iran of attacking ships in the Shatt Al-Arab
before Sept. 22, when Iraq invaded Iran.
   The term ``Saddam's Qadissiyeh'' recalls a 7th century victory
by Arab Islamic troops over the Persians in Iraq that opened the
way for Islam's expansion to the east.

<HEAD>Restaurant Chain Settles Discrimination Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A southern California chain of
restaurants will pay $15,000 each to 23 people who sued, alleging
were denied service because of race or ethnicity.
   Friday's settlement is the third involving the Red Onion chain
of Mexican food restaurants, based in the Los Angeles suburb of
Carson. It was accused of using dress codes and other excuses to
bar minorities from their dining rooms.
   Russell Kerr, who represented black, Hispanic and Arab
plaintiffs, said four more people were expected to accept the
settlements this week.
   In depositions, Red Onion employees said board president Ronald
Newman used the code name ``Norwegians'' for minorities and would
say: ``The room is too dark. There's too many Norwegians in here,''
Kerr said.
   Newman denied the allegations, and Red Onion attorney William A.
Kurlander said that he was unaware of any corporate policy of
discrimination but that he could not speak for each of the chain's
14 restaurants.
   ``I'm not interested in the money, but I'm interested in the
principle,'' said Walter Lujan, 30, who claimed he was denied entry
to the Santa Ana Red Onion in 1986.
   ``Orange County is such a conservative, white type of county.
There was an opportunity to set a precedent here in Orange County
of how things must change.''
   In November, six Iranians who sued in Los Angeles received a
$240,000 settlement and an apology. In addition, at least 22 people
who complained of discrimination in 1986 accepted $500 payments and
agreed to forego legal action.
   The first complaints in 1986 prompted the state to suspend
liquor licenses for six months at Red Onions in Santa Ana,
Fullerton, Riverside and Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Leonid Brezhnev's Son-in-Law, Facing Possible Death Sentence, On
Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-law, accused
of taking $1.1 million in bribes, is expected to lay bare the
widespread corruption of the Brezhnev era.
   Court begins Monday for Yuri Churbanov, a former first deputy
interior minister who once moved in the top levels of Kremlin
society. If found guilty of bribe-taking and abuse of office, he
and eight co-defendants could be executed by firing squad.
   Their trial, and the extraordinary publicity given its
investigatory phase, are in line with Communist Party chief Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's drive to break with the cronyism, corruption and
nepotism now seen as endemic under Brezhnev. Brezhnev ruled the
Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982.
   The court case, to be heard by the Military Collegium of the
Soviet Supreme Court, may also have a political aim _ to signal the
Kremlin Old Guard who flourished under Brezhnev that their time has
passed and that continued resistance to Gorbachev-era reforms must
cease.
   Churbanov, who married Brezhnev's daughter Galina in 1971 after
divorcing his first wife in 1964, is a central figure in an
embezzlement and bribery scheme authorities say centered on the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said that beginning in the
1970s, cotton harvests in Uzbekistan were padded by almost 1
million tons annually, and Moscow was made to pay for the
non-existent crop by corrupt officials all the way up to longtime
Uzbek party boss Sharaf Rashidov, who died in 1983.
   ``Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more
than 4 billion rubles ($6.34 billion) from the state, half of which
they stuffed into their own pockets,'' Pravda said this year in a
sensational expose on the fraud, whose scale is without Soviet
precedent.
   Churbanov, 51, who held the rank of colonel general in the
Moscow-based ministry responsible for police and law enforcement
nationwide, was a power-hungry epicure who helped shield the
racket, Soviet press accounts say.
   ``The son-in-law became the `first violin' at the end of the
70s,'' Pravda said last week. ``Having such a `friend' was not only
an advantage for Rashidov and his group _ it was vitally
important.''
   Churbanov, who worked as a mechanic before taking a low-level
Interior Ministry job in 1961, is accused of accepting bribes
totaling 651,888 rubles, the equivalent of $1.1 million.
   That sum, stupendous by Soviet standards, is equivalent to 270
years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker.
   The weekly Moscow News cited this encounter between Churbanov,
then deputy interior minister, and Abduvakhid Karimov, then
Communist Party boss in Uzbekistan's Bukhara region:
   ``When an earthquake struck the town of Gazli ... Churbanov came
to inspect relief efforts. `There aren't any cigarettes in the
stores,' he berated Karimov on the street. At his dacha that
evening, Karimov gave Churbanov 10,000 rubles ($15,800) in exchange
for the latter's promise `not to report shortcomings to his
superiors.'''
   Karimov was sentenced to death for bribery by the Soviet Supreme
Court in June 1987 after an anti-corruption drive in Uzbekistan
that led to the replacement of two-thirds of all party-appointed
officials.
   Officials announced Churbanov's arrest in February 1987. He was
fired from his top-level Interior Ministry job in 1984, but
reportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administration
for the ministry's uniformed security troops until September 1986.
   Along with Churbanov, currently in KGB custody, eight former
Uzbekistan officials will go on trial: Interior Minister Khaidar
Yakhyaev, two of his deputies and five regional police chiefs.
   The evidence against the nine men fills 110 volumes, and five
volumes were needed to spell out the indictment. A total of 501
witnesses are mentioned in the indictment.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters last
week the trial is expected to last up to two months. Churbanov may
be given the death penalty if convicted, Gerasimov said, because he
is charged with serious economic crimes.
   Churbanov's attorney, Andrei Makarov of Moscow, said in an
interview published last week that his client is being made a
scapegoat for the ills of the Brezhnev era.
   Makarov told the Moscow News: ``The impression is that Churbanov
is being blamed for everything negative that we used to have, or
that Brezhnev is being tried under the name of Churbanov.''
   Pravda, however, called Churbanov ``an example of the
`stagnation period,' when a person reached high position not
because of his merits but due to his family connections.''
   It added: ``Glasnost and democracy will help to avoid
Churbanovism and anything similar to it.''

<HEAD>Death Toll from Starvation Hits 8,000 In Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting and seasonal flooding are
blocking Western relief efforts in southern Sudan, where local
reports indicate 8,000 people have starved to death in recent
weeks, authorities say.
   Southerners arriving from Wau, 660 miles south of Khartoum, said
Saturday that thousands of people trekking north toward the
Kordofan region have been marooned by floods for days. Many died,
they said.
   ``Dozens of people have fallen dead on the roads leading to
Meriam camp due to hunger,'' one new arrival told The Associated
Press.
   Meriam is 500 miles south of Khartoum. The Rev. Aengus Finucane,
director of the Irish aid agency CONCERN, said last month that
about 40 people were dying there daily.
   Bakheet Hussein, another recent arrival, said he knew that
thousands of people ``trying to flee the town of Wau to Babanusa
have perished before reaching there.'' Babanusa is 250 miles north
of Wau.
   A government official said last week that at least 4,000 people
died in Aweil, a way station between Wau and Babanusa that has been
under siege by rebel forces for almost a year.
   Reports from the south reaching the Council of the South, a
government body, said the death toll in Aweil alone rose to 8,000
in recent days and that starvation and disease threatened thousands
in other southern towns.
   Outside confirmation of the reports was virtually impossible.
Even without the chaos caused by August's floods, travel in the
south by journalists and most outsiders has been restricted for
years because of the civil war.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Organization took up arms
against the government in 1983 and claims control over 90 percent
of the southern countryside and towns.
   Fierce fighting between the government and rebels has forced
southerners to leave crops and cattle for the safety of towns.
Faced with dwindling food and medical supplies in these towns,
southerners often try to make their way farther north, usually on
foot.
   Another report reaching the Council of the South said the
situation in Aweil ``is dramatically deteriorating.'' It said
floods washed away roads and bridges connecting the town with the
outside, blocking whatever relief supplies might get through.
   The report said food supplies, especially southern Sudan's
staple sorghum, are low in Wau and Juba, the south's main city 750
miles south of Khartoum.
   The report said floods caused by heavy rains and fighting in the
area was obstructing Western relief organizations' efforts to bring
food and medicine to these areas.

<TEXT>
   Fears of a terrorist attack prompted
strict security measures Sunday as senior government officials from
95 countries began gathering for the Non-Aligned Movement's foreign
ministers conference.
   The five-day conference opens Monday with preparatory meetings.
President George Vassilou formally begins the three-day foreign
ministers' session Wednesday.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat is
expected to attend the conference in his current campaign to muster
support for a plan to proclaim a provisional government for an
independent Palestinian state.
   The conference will map out the 101-member Non-Aligned
Movement's role over the next decade and decide its next chairman.
Zimbabwe is the current chairman.
   Conservative members are backing Indonesia, while more radical
states support Nicaragua, the only other official candidate.
   Some speculated that Cyprus could step in as a compromise
candidate to break any deadlock that develops.
   A special anti-terrorist squad and about 1,500 police officers
have been mobilized to guard the newly built conference center on
Nicosia's southern outskirts and the 14 hotels where the delegates
will stay.
   Police in the Greek-controlled sector of the war-divided east
Mediterranean island have carried out mock terrorist attacks over
the last few days to test security.
   Mobile patrols have been stepped up between Larnaca airport, on
the coast south of the capital, and the port city of Limassol.
   Police units have combed the ravines and hills bordering the
highway. Armored vehicles have been deployed around the beachside
airport.
   Cyprus government spokesman Akis Fantis said peace moves in the
Iran-Iraq war, Angola, the Algeria-Morocco Sahara dispute, the
Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and U.S.-Soviet relations were
``of tremendous importance'' to the movement.
   Fighting between Iran and Iraq, both members of the movement,
halted Aug. 20 when a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect.
   With the recent rapprochement between Greece and Turkey, Greek
and Turkish Cypriots are trying to reconcile their differences as
well.
   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish Army invaded in July
1974 and seized the northern third of the island.
   Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Rauf Denktash, leader
of the Turkish Cypriot minority, broke a four-year deadlock when
they met in Geneva under United Nations auspices Aug. 24.

   A quadriplegic who earns thousands of
dollars in donations on the Boardwalk by using her tongue to play a
portable keyboard again faces charges of breaking the city's
anti-begging laws.
   Celestine Tate faces 12 charges of playing without a permit. She
was issued summonses in 1986 for the same reason, but after a
trial, a lawsuit and a lot of publicity, the city allowed Ms. Tate
to play for money on the Boardwalk.
   The city, in backing down, assigned her a spot on the Boardwalk
and required a permit. But prosecutors said she has not obtained
the permit and has been playing in front of Bally's Park Place
casino hotel two blocks away for most of the summer.
   Ms. Tate argues that her Bally's spot is shaded and that she was
misled into thinking she would receive a merchant's license.
   City officials have instead offered her standard one-day
Boardwalk permits, which require a $1 million insurance bond. She
said such a bond would cost her $500 a day.
   City Prosecutor Steven Smoger said the city ``made a great
dispensation'' in allowing Ms. Tate to play for money on the
Boardwalk. No other person, handicapped or otherwise, has been
given that opportunity, he said.
   Birth defects left Ms. Tate's arms and legs undeveloped. She
supports herself and her children, ages 10 and 12, with the money
she earns on the Boardwalk.
   She said she averages $2,000 a week, enough to send her children
to private school.
   Police have also issued summonses to her brother and two paid
attendants.
   The crackdown on Ms. Tate's business was prompted by several
citizen complaints, Smoger said, declining to elaborate.
   The prosecutor was unsympathetic to Ms. Tate's insurance
problems. ``If that's the price, so be it,'' he said. ``She earns
more than enough to cover that. I think she should absorb the cost
and pay it.
   ``She's a cunning, clever businesswoman,'' he said. ``I think
she is overexaggerating to a great degree.''
   Ms. Tate has requested a trial and time to obtain a lawyer.
Meanwhile, she said, she will continue to entertain Boardwalk
tourists with renditions of songs such as ``We Shall Overcome,''
``Amazing Grace'' and ``Born Free.''

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis make
campaign-launching Labor Day appearances Monday in a race for the
presidency that has ignored the ceremonial starting point and is
already a close and caustic contest.
   ``It kicked off earlier than any presidential campaign I've ever
seen,'' said Frank Greer, a consultant to Democratic candidates.
``The intensity this early is really astounding.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic nominee who has seen a huge midsummer's
lead evaporate, campaigns through the industrial Northeast and
Midwest hungering for the elusive intangibles of momentum and
initiative that he once commanded.
   Bush, the vice president and Republican nominee, enters the
final nine weeks of his race for the White House appearing in
control of their long-distance debate, at least for now, and
enjoying a resurrection in the polls. He was campaigning on the
West Coast.
   Dukakis communications director Leslie Dach said Labor Day is
``when the season really starts'' and represents the point where
the Massachusetts governor steps up his pace from three days of
campaign travel to five each week.
   But the Bush campaign was making no effort to cloak its
candidate in the traditions of Labor Day. Bush passed up a chance
for a visual send-off before the Statue of Liberty, where Ronald
Reagan began his fall campaign in 1980, and a symbolic appearance
with his running mate.
   ``Labor Day as an opening day has been overtaken by events,''
said Bush spokesman Mark Goodin.
   Those events include a blistering round of attacks on Dukakis
leveled by Bush immediately after the Democrats spent four July
days ridiculing the vice president at their Atlanta convention.
And, they include the debate over Bush's controversial running
mate, Dan Quayle, whose selection at a minimum forced a vacationing
electorate to notice this presidential race.
   Both campaigns have revealed their themes, too. Dukakis is
focusing on the economy, and middle class unease about the economic
future, as well as questioning the judgment and fitness of the
Republican ticket.
   ``Most Americans don't feel they're sharing in George Bush's
prosperity,'' said Dach, the Dukakis spokesman. ``We're going to
run on the economic issues. Those are the issues that are going to
decide this election. What Bush is trying to do is deflect the
debate off the issues that people really care about.''
   Bush has concentrated on raising doubts about Dukakis and his
record as governor, while suggesting gentle change from the Reagan
administration in such areas as protecting the environment. Now
Bush plans to focus on jobs and the economy.
   Still to come are what may be the main events: televised
debates, where an error can wreck a candidacy; and the wars of
television advertising, which are certain to be hard fought.
   Bush's TV ads will begin airing soon, campaign manager Lee
Atwater said. Media adviser Roger Ailes is not tipping his hand on
the content, but campaign sources said among them may be one
featuring Maryland victims terrorized by convicted murderer Willie
Horton, who escaped while on a furlough from the Massachusetts
prison system.
   Bush has made a major campaign issue of the furlough program
that allowed passes for first-degree murderers, and which Dukakis
reluctantly agreed to amend in the face of public outcry.
   Confident of his debating style honed as a public television
show host, Dukakis is eager to confront Bush. The Bush campaign,
however, has attempted to minimize the debates. It has agreed to
two debates, plus a third between the running mates, and is
insisting on scheduling them in late September and early October _
when the Olympics and World Series may keep some viewers away.
   Dukakis responded strongly to Bush during their summer jousting,
even at one point evoking the imagery of rotting fish heads in
describing President Reagan and his vice president.
   But his campaign clearly is frustrated by the appearance that he
is reacting and on the defensive, unable to direct the debate.
   There was implicit admission that all is not well in Dukakis'
announcement Friday of the return of his former campaign manager
John Sasso, who resigned in controversy a year earlier.
   And Dukakis on occasion has seemed tentative and reluctant in
their long-distance debates, some believe.
   ``I'm not sure the Democrats have given back as good as we
got,'' said Greer. ``I think we were lulled by that large lead.''
   Where he once led by double-digit margins, Dukakis was shown in
a dead heat with Bush according to most recent polls, including an
ABC News-Washington Post poll last week. It had Dukakis up by 1
percentage point, 43-42, statistically insignificant.
   ``I don't think anyone in the campaign, from top to bottom,
anticipated the race tightening up to our advantage this quick,''
said Bush manager Atwater. ``Our key is not to get confident, not
to get cocky about it.''
   Some Republicans believe Bush still trails a bit, however. ``I
would say we're still realistically 5-6-7 points down,'' said
Republican consultant Eddie Mahe, who is doing work for the Bush
campaign on the West Coast.
   He bases that on the difference, in some polls, of respondents
who say they are deeply committed to a candidate.
   The battle is largely for those wavering or swing voters. They
are often described as Reagan Democrats, self-identified
independents or Democrats who turned away from the party in 1980
and 1984.
   But what is striking is that the race is breathtakingly close
all across the nation _ including the big battleground states like
California, Ohio, Michigan and Texas. Even Dukakis's home state of
Massachusetts is even or nearly so in a recent poll.
   ``When Dukakis was ahead, he was ahead everywhere. When Bush
took the lead, it was everywhere. When it evens out now, it's kind
of even everywhere,'' said Greer. ``It's amazing.''

   The government postponed the enactment
of a new constitution until next month to have more time to prepare
festivities to accompany the event.
   House Speaker Ulysses Guimaraes had suggested Sept. 23 to
coincide with the first days of spring in the Southern Hemisphere,
but other congressmen said more time was need to get the
celebration ready.
   Guimaraes said Saturday that the new date was Oct. 5.
   Rep. Marcelo Cordeiro told reporters that legislators were
considering setting up a big podium outside the Congress, with pop
music stars, regional dances and nationwide TV coverage.
   The 559-member, two-chamber legislature finished work Friday on
the new constitution, Brazil's eighth. It will replace the
authoritarian charter handed down two decades ago by the military
government that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985.
   The 245-article constitution took 19 months to prepare and
touches nearly every aspect of Brazilian life, from maternity leave
and land reform to labor strikes and interest rates.
   Congress is to approve the final draft Sept. 22.

   The new Miss Italy, the first
popularly elected winner of the annual beauty pageant, was hooted
by some fellow contestants because she is 10 years older than many
of them.
   Nadia Bengala, who says she is 26, was crowned Saturday night
during the first live television broadcast of the contest by the
state-run RAI network.
   ``I am very happy, especially after all the controvery over my
age,'' she said, drawing cries of protest from some of the other 63
contestants.
   ``They are very beautiful,'' she added, ``but they can be even
more beautiful in 10 years.'' The runner-up is 17 and third-place
finisher 16.
   Another contestant was disqualified when it was revealed she was
14. After rushing off the stage in tears, she was awarded the title
``Miss Mascot.''
   Last year's Miss Italy pageant was also marred by controversy.
The winner was stripped of her title when she admitted that she was
married and a mother.
   Miss Bengala is a beauty contest veteran who won the Lady Italy
title in 1983. Because she had no official document to prove her
age _ she said her passport was stolen at the Milan train station _
Italian newspapers and news agencies suggested she could be older
than 26.
   Miss Bengala, a part-time model who lives in Milan, received
141,756 votes from television viewers who called a central number.
The call-in votes were combined with those of the on-site jury.
Miss Bengala was the first choice of the TV viewers, but only the
third pick of the jurors.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Aid Failed to Cure Social, Economic Ills in El
Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. aid has helped prevent the takeover of El
Salvador by leftist guerrillas but has failed to solve the
underlying social problems that sparked the insurgency, say four
U.S. Army lieutenant colonels who have served in the Central
American nation and in Vietnam.
   ``The American foundation for conducting small wars is
defective,'' said the report, prepared while the four officers were
on fellowships at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.
   The unsatisfactory results of the U.S. effort in El Salvador,
which the authors described as neither victory nor defeat, stem in
part from local conditions and in part from the failure of the
Reagan administration to clearly define its goals, they said.
   ``The United States provided resources not on the basis of some
overall vision of success but in response to successive and
increasingly acute crises,'' said the four U.S. officers, Lt. Cols.
A.J. Bacevich, James D. Hallums, Richard H. White and Thomas F.
Young.
   Administration officials failed to formulate a long-term
strategy to help cure the social and economic ills of El Salvador,
and did not coordinate the efforts of U.S. military and civilian
advisers, said the report.
   The report also concluded that the U.S. military, despite the
lessons of Vietnam, helped mold the Salvadoran armed forces into a
organization better suited for big European-style conflicts than
Third World guerrilla wars.
   Their findings were contained in a 58-page booklet published by
the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, affiliated with the
Fletcher School on Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, in
Medford, Mass.
   ``As long as the United States remains a great power, American
involvement in small wars will recur with some frequency,'' they
wrote. ``To find fault with American military policy in a
particular instance is not to suggest that the United States is
incapable of effective assistance to an ally threatened by an
insurgency. The important thing is to get it right,'' they wrote,
offering the following suggestions:
   _``Make room for the study of small wars in military schools.''
   _``Clarify organizational responsibilities for fighting small
wars, in Washington and in the field.''
   _``Before undertaking any intervention, establish a vision of
what you hope to accomplish and a consensus of political support to
sustain that vision.''
   _``Send your first team and permit its members the latitude to
get the job done'' rather than training all capable officers to
fight only large-scale wars.
   _``Avoid introducing inappropriate technology.''
   The lieutenant colonels questioned other U.S. officers with
experience in El Salvador and found that none of them ``viewed the
Salvadoran insurgency as primarily a military problem.''
   ``None believed that killing guerrillas alone would win the war.
All expressed the belief that only through political, social and
economic reform could the Salvadoran government hope to defeat the
insurgency,'' the report said.
   The U.S. effort was also hampered by unreliable ``baloney-slice
funding'' doled out by an unenthusiastic Congress, the report said.
   In addition, the Salvadoran Armed Forces have been molded along
the lines of the U.S. military, which is better suited to major
ground offensives than to small-unit guerrilla fighting.
   ``Almost instinctively, Americans take a rich man's approach to
war,'' the report said. ``They view U.S. access to technology,
however expensive, as offering a significant comparative advantage
over potential adversaries,'' it said.
   U.S. military advisers have imbued Salvadoran officers with the
same outlook, the report said. ``Take the example of artillery. The
Salvadoran Army fields 54 105 mm howitzers, employing them in one
or two gun sections used primarily for harassing and interdiction.''
   ``American experience in Vietnam demonstrated that harassing and
interdiction fires in an insurgency are at best wasteful and at
worst counterproductive.'' Nonetheless, the report said, U.S.
advisers endorsed the request of the Salvadoran military ``to
replace its current howitzers with a new model that is identical in
caliber but air-transportable.''
   Similarly, the U.S. military backed a Salvadoran request for
more sophisticated fighters and helicopters, although ``scarcely a
week goes by without an aircraft being destroyed or damaged in an
incident stemming from questionable maintenance or dubious flying
skills'' by Salvadorans inadequately trained to handle
super-sophisticated gadgetry.
   Moreover, guerrilla forces in El Salvador are no longer capable
of fighting major engagements, in which sophisticated fighters and
helicopters can help, and ``now operate in smaller units and
emphasize hit-and-run attacks'' in which such air support is of
limited use, the authors wrote.

<TEXT>
   The release of silty water from the
bottom of a reservoir to irrigate alfalfa has killed hundreds of
fish in one of the last self-sustaining trout streams in the West,
authorities said.
   The release turned a nine-mile stretch of the once-pristine East
Walker River in the eastern Sierra Nevada into a silt-choked brown
wash.
   Some of the trout asphyxiated when silt clogged their gills were
almost 2 feet long and weighed more than 9 pounds.
   The river was declared dead by California Trout, a 3,400-member
sportsmen's conservation group that opposed the water release.
   ``The reservoir release has successfully killed all the trout''
in the river, said spokesman Rick Rockel, who called the loss
``catastrophic.''
   The water _ the lower 12 feet of the Bridgeport Reservoir _ was
released on Wednesday and Thursday for farmers and ranchers
downstream near Yerington, Nev.
   Farmers and ranchers said they needed the water and had a legal
right to it. They said they're struggling after two straight dry
winters and that the water might save this year's crop of alfalfa,
used as livestock feed.
   The East Walker, 110 miles south of Reno, Nev., was one of the
eastern Sierra's last trophy trout streams. It did not need to be
stocked, having one of the few self-sustaining wild trout
populations in the West.
   ``All these dead fish, it sends a chill up my spine,'' said Mike
Markwith, a fly fisherman from Redwood City. ``We'll find some
place else to fish this weekend, but it won't be as good.''
   In August, California Trout unsuccessfully tried to obtain a
restraining order against the draining of the reservoir.
   ``We have no problems sharing this water with our neighbors in
Nevada _ they have a problem, too,'' Rockel said. ``But we have a
problem of losing our fishery and it looks like we did, all because
of improper management.''

<TEXT>
   For the first time, Atlantic City's
casinos are being allowed to use the Miss America Pageant almost as
a publicity prop. But the contestants still cannot set foot on the
gaming floors during pageant week.
   The contest rulebook describes the contestants as ``young ladies
who exemplify the integrity of American youth,'' and it was on that
basis that the pageant never let the gaming halls get involved in
any of the publicity.
   The casinos were mostly outsiders to the pageant festivities,
not allowed to do much more than provide rooms for the women and
decorate floats for the parade.
   But things have changed.
   Casino logos now will figure prominently in many photographs
taken during this year's pageant week.
   Entertainer Merv Griffin, who is in the middle of a deal to buy
Resorts International, was host at a reception Friday night for the
contestants and posed with all 51 under a giant Resorts logo topped
with a crown.
   On Saturday, casino owner Donald Trump invited contestants to be
photographed aboard his opulent yacht, the Trump Princess. In the
morning, contestants posed for a pool shot underneath a large Trump
Plaza sign.
   The Sands and Del Webb's Claridge casino hotels also jumped on
the bandwagon, bringing in Miss America 1988, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko,
to cut the ribbon to a small museum exhibit at the entrance to the
two gaming halls' people mover, a moving sidewalk that carries
customers in from the boardwalk.
   The move to include casinos in the pre-pageant publicity came
with the appointment of Leonard Horn as the pageant's new executive
director. He succeeded veteran Albert Marks, who retired earlier
this year.
   ``Casinos are the only major industry in Atlantic City and have
been very good to the Miss America program,'' Horn said.
   ``But I found out that many of the casinos felt that while
they've been good to us, we've never given them the opportunity to
utilize the Miss America Pageant.''
   They're utilizing the pageant now, and the atmosphere's changing.
   Friday night's reception, for instance, was a rare opportunity
for the 51 women to be seen in an atmosphere of drinking, smoking
and even some suggestive jokes.
   ``Send them in _ this is a buffet tonight,'' Griffin said,
rubbing his hands together in mock anticipation as the contestants
entered.
   Of course, the contestants and their hostesses were not served
any alcoholic beverages with their meals, although waiters poured
wine for anyone next to them.
   And they can't gamble during during pageant week, not even if
they're 21, old enough legally.

   A single-engine plane crashed on
takeoff after aborting an earlier attempt because it was too heavy
with fuel, and all four men aboard were killed, authorities said.
   The Cessna 172 crashed Saturday about 100 yards north of the
runway of Grand Canyon Airport, 10 miles south of the canyon, said
Ron Warren, a spokesman for Grand Canyon Airlines, which is based
at the airport.
   On the first attempt to take off, the pilot radioed the control
tower that the plane was too heavy with fuel and then taxied back
to the terminal, Warren said.
   ``They tried to spend the night, but everything in town was
full,'' he said. The plane made a second takeoff attempt after
draining excess fuel, he said.

   A shopkeeper who bought a stolen, $15,000
bassoon for $3 and a pack of cigarettes tracked down the owner,
who's once again playing a cheerful tune.
   ``I thought it was shark bait by this time. I was very fearful
it would end up in a dumpster or the river,'' Cyrus Segal, 62, a
bassoonist with the New York City Opera, said Saturday.
   When he finally sat down with the 5-foot-long woodwind again,
Segal said, ``I felt like I was having a conversation with a
long-lost friend.''
   Mark Mavris, owner of a luggage and gift shop, said he had been
looking for the bassoon's rightful owner since an apparently
homeless man sold it to him.
   ``He said he wanted $10 for it _ he didn't know what it was,''
Mavris said. ``I gave him $3. I guess he figured he could get lunch
money out of it.''
   Segal was standing outside Lincoln Center on Wednesday, the
instrument in a black canvas bag wedged between his leg and a
building column, when it was snatched, police said.
   His wife, Myra, who is also a musician, said a colleague called
her and told her Mavris was looking for the bassoon's owner.
   ``He's been stopping musicians on the street and asking them,''
she said. ``I ran out, ran down the street and the man would not
even take the three dollars for it.''
   Segal has owned the double-reed bass woodwind for 25 years. It
was made by Heckel, a German company that takes three years to fill
an order for an instrument.

<TEXT>
   Former White House National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane finds ``very legitimate''
parallels between U.S. involvement in Vietnam and Reagan
administration policy in Central America, according to a new book
in which he is quoted.
   The book, ``On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan
Presidency,'' also quotes Michael Deaver, former deputy White House
chief of staff, as saying that Alexander Haig ``wanted to clean
house'' in Central America and made ``outrageous'' statements about
the subject when he was secretary of state.
   The book was written by Mark Hertsgaard, an investigative
journalist who has written two books about the nuclear power
industry. It is being published this month by Farrar, Straus &
Giroux.
   Hertsgaard argues in the book that the news media have shown a
``more deferential attitude'' toward President Reagan than toward
other recent presidents.
   This made it easy, he says, for Haig ``to promote his analysis
of the situation in Central America through the press'' _ an
analysis that held that the Soviet Union and Cuba were fomenting
revolution in the region.
   As controversy developed over the administration's Central
American policies, however, Hertsgaard writes, ``a new theme
emerged in news coverage: Was the United States getting involved in
another Vietnam?''
   Reagan repeatedly denied that he intended to send U.S. troops to
the region and ``seemed almost to resent the Vietnam parallels,''
Hertsgaard said.
   The author reports, however, that McFarlane, in an interview for
the book, said the issues of Cuban-Soviet involvement and of a
possible repeat of Vietnam ``contribute to a very reasonable
framework for press treatment of the issue.''
   ``Evoking a recollection of Vietnam is a very legitimate point
to make, because it simply exposes the reality of difficulty you
will have in sustaining popular support for your policy,''
McFarlane is quoted as saying. ``That's a valid criticism. You may
not like it, but it's real.''
   McFarlane has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of
withholding information from congressional committees investigating
covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels at a time when military assistance
to them was prohibited.
   Hertsgaard reports that both Deaver and his boss, then White
House Chief of Staff James Baker, were ``leery of the Central
America initiative from the start.''
   ``Baker and I tried constantly to keep under control the whole
Central America thing,'' Deaver is quoted as saying. ``Haig wanted
to go in there and clean house. I can't even tell you what things
he said; things that were outrageous. And I remember him saying, in
his inimitable style, `Mr. President, this is one you can win!'
talking about Nicaragua.''
   ``This was five years ago: This is one you can win and you can
win it quickly,'' Deaver is quoted as saying in the November 1986
interview, continuing to recall Haig's words.
   ``Baker and I constantly cautioned the president about that,''
Deaver said. ``A, you cannot win. B, the American people will not
stand still for a war in Central America.''
   Hertsgaard said Haig declined to be interviewed for the book.
   McFarlane told the writer, ``Al wanted a major stress (and) the
use of Reagan's high political standing early in his first term.
(The) president didn't want to do that. He wanted to invest that
capital in tax reduction.''
   Hertsgaard reports that the three major television networks
broadcast 186 news stories about El Salvador in the first three
months of 1981. However, he says, after a White House decision to
``low-key'' the issue, the number dropped to 60 in the following
three months although the civil war in the Central American country
continued unabated.

   Two East Germans escaped to the West by swimming
across a canal Sunday, but border guards thwarted another escape
attempt when they fired at a man trying to flee his communist
homeland, police said.
   The would-be escapist, who did not appear to be injured, was
arrested and led away by border troops, a police spokesman in West
Berlin said.
   In all, two East German border guards and four other people have
fled to West Berlin the last three days.
   Police said two men in their early 30s swam across a canal to
reach West Berlin early Sunday.
   On Saturday, the two guards jumped across the heavily fortified
border into the British-controlled sector of West Berlin, police
said. Both guards were being questioned by British authorities,
police said.
   On Friday, two men made a daring pre-dawn escape to West Berlin
by swimming across the Havel River. The men were spotted by an East
German patrol boat that gave pursuit to the border but no shots
were fired.
   None of the escapees was identified in accordance with West
German regulations.

<TEXT>
   The communist government has approved a
new group that advocates multiparty elections, but members say they
have no intention of starting their own political party.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum established itself as a
``democratic, intellectual and political movement'' by adopting a
charter on Saturday, the state news agency MTI reported.
   Hungarian state radio said the forum wants to field candidates
for national, regional and local elections.
   But forum members said they don't plan to form a political party
and only want to promote ``an open coalition-type movement, open to
any honest thoughts and initiatives.''
   The forum's 364 delegates met in a tent at Lakitelek, 75 miles
south of Budapest, the same village where a group of nonconformist
intellectuals met in September 1987 to form a loose organization
under the same name.
   Commenting on the forum meeting, government spokesman Gyoergy
Marosan told Hungarian radio, ``On the basis of government policy,
this is a welcome development.''
   Marosan, the son of a former leading Social Democrat in
pre-communist Hungary, said the government would cooperate with the
movement as long as the forum cooperates.
   He said if people wonder about the ``foundation of a new
party,'' they underestimate recent changes in Hungary.
   Prime Minister Karoly Grosz, who took over from Janos Kadar in
May, has pushed for political and economic reforms. Kadar had led
Hungary since Soviet troops put down the Hungarian uprising in 1956.
   The fact that the meeting was reported in the state media was
another indication that the forum has received official blessing.
   MTI said the forum considers a multiparty system ``indispensable
in the process of democracy.''
   The news agency quoted forum leaders as saying the movement
wants to operate ``within the framework of constitutionality and
legality, before the general public in all openness.''
   One of the speakers at the meeting, Csaba G. Kis, called for a
coalition of socialists, Christian Democrats and liberals, said
Austrian journalist Karl Pfeifer, who attended the meeting.
   ``We do not strive to hold power, but we want to control
power,'' Kis was quoted as saying.
   Sandor Csoori, a leading member of the forum, said he received
official permission to publish a journal called Credit every other
week beginning in November.
   Delegates told a news conference that dissidents who have been
able to write only for underground publications would be given a
chance to contribute legally to the forum's journal.

<HEAD>Negative Advertising Likely in Close Presidential Race</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 10th graf Rogich refused with 2 grafs to include

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most negative political advertising
campaign ever is likely this fall from two presidential candidates
who are close in the polls, close on the issues and far from shy
about going on the offensive.
   Students of political advertising say media drives by the George
Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigns are likely to begin on an upbeat
note.
   But viewers shouldn't expect sunshine and roses on the air.
Critical ads ranging from mild comparisons to outright blasts are
planned by independent groups and the two parties, and the
candidates are expected to follow suit later in the season.
   Ultimately, the race will be ``the most negative in the history
of TV,'' predicted Kathleen Jamieson, a University of Texas
professor and author of two books on political communications.
   Democrat Dukakis and Republican Bush both scheduled traditional
Labor Day week media assaults, with at least one of them employing
a soft sell as the campaign season formally begins.
   ``Our plan is to be on the air with ads about Michael Dukakis'
record,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach. ``The major thrust of
the first wave will be cutting taxes, balancing budgets, putting
people to work, cutting crime and taking charge of our economic
future. Those are ads that George Bush can't make.''
   Dach would not say how much money will be spent on the first
wave but he said it will ``hit a lot of states... We intend these
ads to be seen by people, not just to be read about.''
   The Bush campaign is more closemouthed about its plans, although
it has been reported that a three-week, $1 million TV campaign will
start this week in California.
   ``We're firm about not discussing any media buying strategy or
any creative strategy,'' said Sig Rogich, Bush's director of
advertising operations. ``The Democrats will tell you (their
plans), and we appreciate it,'' he added.
   Rogich refused to comment on a report from campaign sources that
media adviser Roger Ailes has taped ads attacking Dukakis' defense
ideas and interviewing a Maryland couple victimized by convicted
murderer Willie Horton, a Massachusetts prisoner furloughed under
the state's program.
   Dukakis' predecessor, Republican Gov. Francis Sargent,
instituted the furlough program which Dukakis has supported.
Earlier this year, the Massachusetts governor reluctantly signed
legislation removing eligibility for first-degree murderers.
   At least one independent group plans a month-long, $540,000
assault on Dukakis via national cable networks starting Tuesday,
according to The Washington Post. The two 30-second ads produced
for Americans for Bush charge that Dukakis is soft on crime and
criminals. One cites the weekend prisoner furlough program and
Dukakis' opposition to the death penalty; the other focuses on
Horton.
   Dach says Dukakis plans to counter such attacks with ads touting
his effective crime-cutting record in Massachusetts. But he said
plans could change, depending on what comes out of the Republican
camp.
   Some relatively negative ads are coming from the Democratic and
Republican national committees, which are running multimillion
dollar generic media campaigns designed to promote party themes and
accomplishments as superior to the opposition.
   The GOP just completed a $4 million TV ad campaign that involved
three spots running for two weeks in every state. The ads claim
Americans have known only peace and prosperity under Republicans,
so why change?
   RNC spokesman Beth Brainard said plans for the timing and
content of next wave were up in the air but ``things are in place''
for another hit if it is needed. ``We're going to wait and see the
tenor of the campaign,'' she said. ``There may be a need to issue
specific ads of some kind that incorporate our message of peace,
prosperity, economic growth and seven years of success.''
   The DNC, financially equipped to run its first major generic
campaign this year, bought $75,000 worth of Texas airtime for a
quick counterpunch to the initial GOP ads and this week embarks on
a $1 million-plus generic ad campaign in seven to 12 swing states
likely to include California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Missouri, New Jersey, Iowa, Wisconsin and Texas.
   The DNC ads, centered on the theme of ``bringing prosperity
home,'' are two-pronged. Some deal with competitiveness, world debt
and the deficit _ making America No. 1 again. Others talk about
economics on a more personal scale _ health care, child care, the
ability to buy homes and cars.
   The point, said Dach, is that ``if you're a family that's
working harder to stay in place, you can't afford to vote
Republican.''
   By the time the Bush-Dukakis campaign ends, Jamieson said,
negative TV advertising should surpass the high-water mark set
during the bitter 1964 Johnson-Goldwater battle, the most negative
to date.
   Observers cite a number of factors in explaining why they expect
a nasty TV campaign:
   _Attack ads were a major feature of both party's primary
contests this year, providing both precedent and raw material.
   _Bush and to some extent Dukakis are already giving very tough
speeches, and advertising traditionally is more negative than
speeches.
   _The candidates are neck-and-neck in the polls, giving them both
an incentive to go negative.
   _Neither candidate is particularly well-defined, making it
imperative that every attack be answered by a counter-attack lest
voters get and keep the wrong idea.
   _Both candidates are relatively centrist, with few significant
differences on issues. ``If you don't have broad issue
disagreements, then you concentrate on the personal,'' said Larry
Sabato, a University of Virginia professor specializing in election
media, polling and direct mail.
   Jamieson said the 1964 campaign was the most negative in the
number of negative ads produced and aired, but neither candidate
devoted more than one-third of his air time to negative ads.
   She and Sabato predicted negative messages will fill one-third
to one-half of each candidate's air time this year, and neither
will let negative ads eclipse positive ones.
   Why? ``It's just too risky in terms of backlash,'' Sabato said.
``Attacking is not presidential,'' added Jamieson. ``You can get by
with negative ads as long as the positive message is out there.''

   While politicians normally don't want to be
linked with women other than their wives, there's one gal that
candidates have been fawning over for more than 100 years.
   She's 151 feet tall and stands demurely in New York Harbor.
   Candidates and their image makers say there's no better company
to be seen in _ especially on coast-to-coast television _ than that
of the Statue of Liberty.
   So coveted is she as political company that the campaigns of
Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, and
Republican vice presidential contender Sen. Dan Quayle clashed over
which of them would hold the lady's hand this Labor Day.
   Quayle prevailed, but only because he asked first, according to
the National Park Service. As the statue's custodian, the Park
Service takes great pains to assure the statue does not show
favorites.
   Still, she has been always been a willing companion since her
dedication by President Grover Cleveland in 1886. Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon have all paid calls on the
statue during re-election bids.
   ``The Statue of Liberty is something special,'' says Greg
Stevens of Ailes Communications, media consultant for George Bush.
   For tugging at voters' emotions, the grandiose statue and her
dramatic surroundings are a better backdrop than any Hollywood set.
   The statue took its prime place in the World War I war bond
drives of 1917, replacing the female Columbia as the
personification of America, says Park Service archivist Barry
Marino.
   No less an image maker than Alfred Hitchcock dropped a villian
from the statue's torch in ``Saboteur'' about 27 years before
putting Cary Grant and Grace Kelly on Mount Rushmore in ``North by
Northwest.''
   ``There's more emotion packed in the Statue of Liberty than
almost anything else in America,'' Stevens says.
   President Reagan chose Liberty State Park in Jersey City, N.J.,
to kickoff the 1980 campaign that put him in the White House. The
Hudson River-front park offers a dramatic view of the statue
against the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan.
   Wilson, running against New York Republican Charles Hughes in
1916, led an elaborate parade to relight the statue's torch after
it was damaged by sabatoge. Roosevelt, campaigning against Alf
Landon in 1936, gave a dramatic radio address by the statue during
its 50th anniversary celebration.
   This year, along with Quayle and Dukakis, former presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson has used the park as a political staging
ground.
   Both Dukakis and Quayle wanted to appear Monday at the
two-island Statue of Liberty-complex: Liberty Island, where the
statue stands, and Ellis Island, where millions of immigrants
entered the United States in the late 1800's and early 1900's.
   Since Quayle asked first, Dukakis had to settle for a tour of
Ellis Island on Saturday. He escorted his mother, Euterpe, a Greek
immigrant who arrived in this country via the island.
   ``It's first come, first served,'' explained Edie Shean-Hammond,
a Parks Service spokeswoman.
   She said rangers follow strict guidelines in issuing permits for
speeches and demonstrations. Access for daily visitors always comes
first, followed by equal access for anyone seeking to use the
statue as a soapbox.
   ``We have to play this really close to the book,'' Ms.
Shean-Hammond said.

   There's a new multimillionaire
somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers
needed to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least
$54 million, officials said Sunday.
   The winning $1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchased
in Longwood, a town of 14,500 in central Florida, Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winner
steps forward.
   Eight-digit riches were also doled out in New York, where one
winning ticket was purchased for a $23 million jackpot Saturday
night, and in Illinois, where holders of four winning tickets will
split a $21 million prize.
   The previous national record jackpot, $51.4 million, was shared
by two California lottery players in June. A Pennsylvania couple
had the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won
$46 million in 1987.
   The new Florida millionaire _ or millionaires, if several
persons shared the ticket _ get 180 days to claim the prize. The
earliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday.
   The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lottery
withholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes,
although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. Florida has no
state income tax.
   Splitting a $54 million payout into 20 installments, and
deducting 20 percent, would bring the annual check to $2.16 million.
   Officials had estimated Saturday's jackpot at $52 million, but a
last-minute frenzy of sales that sometimes topped 850 tickets a
second raised the total to $54 million. It could be even larger,
depending on final sales figures.
   Saturday sales totaled 14.6 million tickets, and total weekly
purchases were 44.78 million by the 11 p.m. drawing.
   Players had turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to
beat the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out
of 49. The winning numbers were 3-5-19-20-27-35.
   Until Saturday, there hadn't been a winner in the drawing since
Aug. 6. That boosted the jackpot with each passing week.
   ``This became an international news story. What better way to
let people know about your lottery than through an international
news story?'' Mrs. Paul said at a news conference. Florida began
its lottery only this year.
   At least $20 million of the week's lottery profits will go to
state education, she said.
   Longwood Mayor David R. Gunter said he was delighted to have the
$54 million ticket sold in his town. The bedroom community 18 miles
northeast of Orlando has several lottery outlets.
   ``I think we're due to be on the map,'' said Gunter. ``This is
one great way to put us on it. It's always good to have a small
city wake up and learn that one individual has had such fantastic
luck.''
   Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players won
smaller prizes.
   Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales.
   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto
News in Miami. ``It's madness.''
   Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited Florida's Lotto
with boosting their sales.
   ``That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery of
everyone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales,'' said
Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   As in Florida, the winners of the $21 million Illinois drawing
and the $23 million New York lottery were not immediately
identified.
   The winning ticket in New York was sold in prosperous
Westchester County, north of New York City, while the four winning
tickets in Illinois were sold in the suburbs of Chicago.
   Florida Lottery spokesman Ed George spoke via telephone on an
Arizona radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions from
people who wanted to play Florida's game.
   ``I told them to climb into a good solid car or buy a plane
ticket and come on out and visit,'' George said.

   A chlorine gas leak from a swimming pool
supply company forced up to 1,000 people from their homes for the
second day in a row early Sunday, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported. Most of the evacuations were in
Montebello, eight miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and residents
were allowed back about 8 a.m., 2{ hours later.
   The leak occurred during cleanup at The Grow Group Inc.
warehouse where a mishap on Saturday spewed a low-lying,
half-mile-long chlorine cloud, sent 37 people to hospitals and
forced the evacuation of up to 15,000.
   ``I understand that the cloud was not as visible, and seemed to
be much smaller,'' said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Richard
Sweeney. ``There was a definite smell of chlorine.''
   Chlorine can be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise
causes mostly burning eyes and sore throats.
   The leak Saturday occurred when a powdered chemical used to make
chlorine tablets for pools contacted moisture or another
contaminant, producing a reaction, authorities said.
   ``There's a company cleaning up from the incident yesterday and
they just happened to dump a little more on the ground,'' Sweeney
said. ``It wasn't any big deal. It was less than 100 pounds.''
   As before, soda ash was used to neutralize the material, but
more small spills were possible as the cleanup continued, Sweeney
said. ``A guy turns a shovel the wrong way and it might react
again,'' he said.
   The evacuation was ordered by county health officials monitoring
the cleanup. Fewer than 1,000 residents were involved, said Deputy
Chief Steve Simonian of the Montebello Police Department.
   The earlier evacuation covered several square miles of East Los
Angeles, Monterey Park, Montebello and Commerce, authorities said.
   A similar reaction occurred in several drums of the same
material on Aug. 17, but no gas cloud was released and no injuries
were reported, said Les Wilde, president of Grow Group's Consumer
and Professional Products Group.
   ``The prime suspect is moisture ... some moisture from
condensation from the high humidity we've been having,'' Wilde said.
   The Saturday evacuation was criticized by a local community
group. ``The lack of organization was frightening,'' said Angie
Rojas. ``This morning there were many people walking the street
with their children looking for a safe site.''
   The group said authorities failed to provide mass transportation
or evacuation warnings in Spanish. The area is primarily Hispanic.

   West Bank Jewish settlers demonstrated Sunday
to demand government permission to shoot at Palestinian
stone-throwers. Soldiers in the occupied lands shot and wounded
three Palestinian protesters.
   At a Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir denied news
reports that he recommended expanding defense rules to allow
soldiers and civilians to fire back at stone-throwers in the
occupied lands, ministers said.
   Jewish settlers have been demanding both the army and settlers
be allowed to open fire on Palestinians throwing stones. Only
soldiers now are allowed to shoot at Arab firebombers. Settlers are
permitted to fire back only in the case of imminent danger to life.
   The controversy over those rules flared last week when a
U.S.-born Jewish settler accidentally shot and wounded two Israeli
soldiers. The settler, Gedalia Becker, stopped his car and fired in
the dark after a firebomb attack.
   About 200 residents of the West Bank settlement of Einav
occupied a park opposite Shamir's office Sunday and said they can't
live in their settlement because government policies don't allow
adequate protection against stone-throwers.
   Small children and their mothers sat under tents marked ``Day
Care Center'' and ``Kindergarten,'' surrounded by six police vans
and about two dozen policemen.
   Einav secretary Baruch Lior said two people from his settlement
of 40 families have been hit in the head in stone-throwing attacks
the last 10 days.
   ``We demand an elementary right to protect our lives. The army
is doing everything it can, but the government ties its hands. Can
the government say it did not spill this blood?'' Lior said.
   An elderly injured settler, Shlomo Levi, lay nearby on a
stretcher, a blood-stained bandage on his head. Levi was surrounded
by praying Jews, one of whom held a prayer book and an Uzi
submachine gun on his knees.
   At Shamir's office, the Cabinet debated rules of opening fire.
Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of the Labor Party told Israel radio
he accused Shamir of trying to turn the occupied lands into a
``wild West where each one takes the law in his hands.''
   Shahal's attack followed media reports that Shamir, head of the
rival Likud bloc, supports the idea of shooting stone-throwers.
   But Shamir denied supporting such a proposal, said his
spokesman, Avi Pazner.
   ``Israel is facing a wave of terror and has to meet it with a
firm hand. Security forces are working on methods to counter the
stone-throwing. ... It's good that the Cabinet debates it, and we
hope the army will soon find an answer,'' Pazner quoted Shamir as
telling the ministers.
   In the occupied West Bank, troops shot an 18-year-old
Palestinian, Suheil Harb, wounding him in the stomach, Arab reports
and hospital officials said. They said he was wounded during a
clash with soldiers at Kafr Sur village, close to Einav.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, another Arab, 22-year-old Mahmoud
Abdel Fatah of Deir el Balah village, was shot in the leg,
officials at the Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza said.
   An official at Al Ittihad Hospital told The Associated Press
that 26-year-old Ibrahim Yussef Sohahmi was shot and seriously
wounded in the neck during a clash with Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank village of Silat el Harithiya, near Jenin.
   The army said it knew of no clash between soldiers and
Palestinians in Deir el Balah, confirmed that a Palestinian was
shot and lightly wounded in the leg in Kafr Sur and was
investigating the reported shooting in Silat el Harithiya.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 against Israeli rule
in the occupied lands, 5,600 Arabs have been wounded, according to
Israeli army figures. At least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis
have died.

<HEAD>Normally Closed Communist Party Meeting Televised Live</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gorky residents received dramatic proof of the
greater openness in their nation's public affairs when local
Communist Party officials allowed a party meeting to be televised
live for the first time.
   During the broadcast, residents of the Volga River city 250
miles east of Moscow could call in and make proposals to the party
officials, the government newspaper Izvestia said Sunday.
   ``We hope the discussion of burning problems in the presence of
the people and with the help of television will become a standard
of party work,'' Ivan V. Chapanov, a senior Gorky party executive,
was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper said the broadcast of the Gorky regional party
organization's meeting on Saturday was a first for the region, but
it was believed to be the first time any body in the 20
million-member party had allowed a full, live broadcast of its
proceedings. The broadcast also was reported by the Tass news
agency.
   Despite Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promotion of
``glasnost,'' or more openness in public affairs, deliberations of
party organizations up to the ruling Politburo continue to be held
in secret. Often their meetings are only sketchily reported to the
public.
   At a nationwide party conference held in Moscow this summer,
some delegates demanded more information be made public about the
work and responsibilities of party organizations and officials.
   Speaking in a telephone interview with Izvestia, Chapanov said
Saturday's plenary party meeting in Gorky ``was preceded by a month
of strenuous work for preparing the live broadcasting, which is
unusual so far in party practices.''
   A newspaper in Gorkey announced in advance the plan to televise
the regional party plenum, Chapanov said.
   Phone numbers that gave people access to the meeting hall were
also made public, he said.
   According to Chapanov, ``people appreciated the initiative. Some
50 telephone calls and proposals were registered during the work of
the session.''
   Izvestia and Tass did not make clear whether the Gorky regional
committee intended to continue allowing live coverage of its
sessions, or whether the practice could spread elsewhere.
   In the past, top Communist Party officials, including Ideology
Secretary Alexander N. Yakovlev, have defended the party's practice
of holding meetings behind closed doors, saying the need for
greater openness in government does not oblige the party, legally a
private body, to open its proceedings to all.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Aung Gyi said Sunday
that Burma's rulers must ``face the reality'' and allow an interim
government to usher in immediate democracy and end nationwide chaos.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Congressman Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., said he
would introduce a measure next week in Congress expressing U.S.
support for a rapid transition to multi-party democracy in Burma.
   Speaking at a Bangkok news conference after a two-day trip to
Burma, Solarz said Burma's political future would probably be
decided in the next week.
   ``I think there is no question that Burma is on the dawn of a
new era of democracy,'' Solarz said. ``The only question is whether
the new era will emerge peacefully ... or whether it will be the
product of chaos, anarchy and violence.''
   At their meeting in Rangoon earlier Sunday, Aung Gyi told Solarz
the entire country rejected the government's plan for gradual
change.
   Solarz met separately with two other protest leaders: former
Defense Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of late
Burmese independence leader Aung San. Solarz also lunched at the
Parliament Building with President Maung Maung.
   No major rallies were held in the capital Sunday, but protest
leaders called for daily demonstrations this week leading up to a
nationwide general strike Thursday.
   Solarz chairs the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. He has been a critic of repressive
governments in Asia and said he was visiting Rangoon to see what
the United States could do to encourage democracy.
   Solarz asked Aung Gyi his reaction to Maung Maung's plan for the
Burma Socialist Program Party to meet on Sept. 12 to consider a
popular vote on whether to end 26 years of one-party rule.
   ``The whole country is against it,'' said Aung Gyi, who was
recently released from a month of detention for criticizing the
party's harsh repression of dissent and ruinous economic policies.
   ``Government employees are on strike, the administration has
practically broken down, the situation has deteriorated very fast
and is now beyond control,'' Aung Gyi said.
   ``The whole country demanded immediate formation of an interim
government to ease the situation. The government has to face the
reality.''
   Aung Gyi said he believes Ne Win, who took power in a 1962
military coup in but officially resigned in July, still wields
``100 percent'' power.
   Hardliner Sein Lwin replaced Ne Win, but his 17-day rule was
ended by massive and bloody street protests that left 112 dead by
government count. Maung Maung took over Aug. 19 as the first
civilian leader since 1962.
   Aung Gyi said the people had tolerated their government for many
years, but recent months brought ``a series of intolerable things.''
   He said these included the government's voiding of a large
portion of currency notes without compensation in September and
rice shortages in a nation that once was the world's largest
exporter.

<HEAD>Lightning Danger Greater Than Thunder Indicates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bolts of lightning strike far more often than
weather records indicate, making electrical storms more dangerous
than previously believed, a weather researcher warns.
   The reason is that most records on lightning occurrences are
compiled by observers who listen for thunder, which is produced by
lightning.
   But new research shows that between 22 percent and 40 percent of
lightning flashes occur when no thunder was heard.
   ``It is not good news,'' researcher Stanley A. Changnon said of
his findings, reported in the August edition of the Journal of
Geophysical Research-Atmospheres.
   ``Those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage,
for example nuclear power plants, have had to use data based on
(thunder records) to develop their risk analyses,'' Changnon said
in a telephone interview.
   ``It's very clear that thunder rather dramatically
underestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point,'' he
said.
   Changnon, a weather researcher affiliated with the Illinois
State Water Survey who also teaches at the University of Rochester
in Rochester, N.Y., used electromagnetic detectors to record actual
cloud-to-ground flashes of lightning.
   His report was done in conjunction with his son, David Changnon
of Colorado State University, and Richard B. Pyle of the State
University of New York at Albany.
   Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s,
Changnon said, but they have always depended on the reports of
trained observers, who primarily listen for thunder.
   In recent years, however, electromagnetic detectors have been
installed in many areas to record actual lightning strokes.
   The researchers compared the thunder reports of weather
observers with the lightning records from sensors used by the
federal Bureau of Land Management in Western states and by
electrical utilities along the Eastern seaboard.
   ``The degree of relationship is relatively weak,'' Changnon
reported. ``It gives one a lot of pause, in many respects, about
how the atmosphere works, how good our weather records are and how
safe we are.''
   In the West, Changnon reported, between 31 percent and 40
percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listening
for thunder.
   The situation was better in the East, with 22 percent to 26
percent of lightning strokes being missed, the report said.
   The differences between observations in the East and the West
occurs, at least in part, because of greater problems in hearing
thunder in the West, particularly in mountainous areas, he said.
   Lightning killed 86 Americans last year, the highest death toll
in this decade but lower than the annual average of 96, according
to records kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The agency counted 365 lightning-related injuries in 1987, about
50 percent higher than the annual average, due largely to a series
of strikes that hit groups of people.
   ``Lightning apparently does not command the respect it deserves
as a dangerous killer,'' E. W. Friday, director of the National
Weather Service, has warned. Friday said only floods compete with
lightning in deadliness.
   Last year's death toll was the most since 88 people died in
lightning strikes in 1978. But that falls far short of several
deadly years in the 1960s, including 1963 when 210 people were
killed by lightning.
   As usual, Florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last
year. Tennessee ranked second with 6, followed by 5 in New Mexico
and 4 each in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York
and North Carolina.
   Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey,
Oklahoma and South Carolina each recorded three fatalities. There
were two each in Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Virginia.
States recording a single lightning death for the year were
Washington, D.C., Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and
South Dakota.

<TEXT>
   Gang violence rages on in the City of Angels
and street thugs are expanding their drug trade to other U.S.
cities despite police sweeps, a new FBI task force and two ``gang
summits.''
   More than 200 people have died in gang-related slayings so far
this year; 11 people were slain last weekend, and an undercover
policeman was shot to death Saturday while tailing suspects in a
drive-by shooting.
   Los Angeles County had a record 387 gang-related slayings in
1987, and authorities are expecting more than 420 in 1988, said
Deputy District Attorney Michael Genelin, head of the district
attorney's Hardcore Gang Unit.
   Drive-by gang killings now average more than one a day and often
claim innocent bystanders.
   Community outcry prompted Los Angeles police to launch a
full-scale assault in March. Twice since then, they have marched
1,000 officers into the most gang-infested areas on weekends.
   The result has been a decline in the overall crime rate,
although the gang murder rate continues to climb.
   ``We're in a holding action. We're keeping the flames from
spreading but we're not putting them out,'' said Robert
Philibosian, former district attorney and head of a state task
force on gangs and drugs.
   Los Angeles gangs are expanding their cocaine-trafficking
networks as far as Seattle, Kansas City, Mo., and Philadelphia, law
enforcement authorities said.
   ``We have people coming from L.A. to sell cocaine, not to start
gangs. It's a business deal here, it's not gangs,'' said Seattle
police Officer Dan Fordice.
   A Los Angeles gang member was recently sentenced to 25 years in
prison in Seattle for selling drugs near a school, he said. Kansas
City has had eight successful prosecutions of Los Angeles gang
members for narcotics offenses, said Sgt. Kathleen Pierce.
   ``It just another brand of slug we have to deal with,'' Fordice
sighed.
   Authorities said it will take much more than cops on corners to
make a dent in the 70,000 members of the 600 gangs in the county.
   ``It's going to take years. The FBI has worked at stopping the
drug problem for 30 years and still hasn't stopped it,'' said
Lawrence Lawler, the new FBI chief for Los Angeles. ``It's a form
of life to some people. It may be an entire generation before this
goes away.''
   When Lawler arrived here from Minneapolis two months ago, his
first big action was to establish an FBI gang unit here because he
had begun to see Los Angeles' Bloods and Crips gangs sell cocaine
in St. Paul, Minn.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner also created an anti-gang unit of
federal and local law enforcement.
   City police will continue the sweeps and will also begin
targeting hardcore leaders of the most powerful gangs, said Deputy
Police Chief William Rathburn.
   A similar effort was conducted in 1979 and 1980, and authorities
found that when the leaders were put away, activity in their gangs
and their neighborhoods dissipated, Philibosian said. But those
leaders are now coming out of prison, he said.
   Clergy members tried their part this summer by holding two gang
summits. The first, in July, attracted about a dozen people. A
two-day summit last week drew 50, and some members of the rival
Crips and Bloods vowed to lay down their arms, end their gang
affiliations and form a network to persuade others to do the same.
   ``We have intelligence and want a quality education. I know that
we're running out of time. ... America, listen today,'' said gang
member Raymond Cook Bay, who attended the summit.
   Officials have criticized the summits for giving a false
impression of optimism because the handful of gang members
participating don't represent the 70,000 on the street. But
organizers said at least they're doing something.
   Officials also cautioned it will be a long time before new
programs and law enforcement efforts take effect.

   Miss Universe 1988, Porntip
Nakhirunkanok of Thailand, said Sunday she is establishing a
foundation for needy children so they will know she won't desert
them when her reign is over.
   ``Children are just being turned away, (in) backyards, trash
cans and that's a nightmare, an absolute nightmare,'' said Porntip,
20.
   Porntip left Thailand at age 2 and grew up in southern
California, studying at Pasadena City College. She returned to
Bangkok Aug. 23 for a visit during which she has helped raise money
for orphans and other neglected children.
   ``Throughout my travels this year, I very much want to use my
personal celebrity to, in some small way, make a difference in the
lives of children of all nationalities,'' she said.

   An engine on an airplane carrying musician Jerry
Jeff Walker and several band members caught fire while landing at
Dallas Love Field, but the fire was extinguished and no one was
hurt.
   ``As he was taxiing in, the right engine was on fire,'' said Len
Perryman, operations supervisor at the airport. He said didn't know
how the fire started.
   ``We're all right,'' Walker said of Saturday's mishap. ``We're
just worried about the plane, that's all. (The plane has) been
helping us all summer.''
   Walker, who has recorded on the MCA and Elektra labels and wrote
``Mr. Bojangles,'' said he was flying from Austin for a concert.

   Albert A. Marks, Jr., the man
responsible for directing the course of the Miss America Pageant
over the past 35 years, is forcing himself to sit on the sidelines
this year now that he has retired.
   The former pageant director did not even come to the Convention
Center last week. Instead, he let the new executive director,
Leonard Horn, learn by trial and error.
   But Marks, 75, said he will attend the televised pageant
Saturday night in a box reserved for him, and he did allow himself
to attend a reception for the 51 contestants last week.
   Marks initially said he would stay on after his retirement to
assist Horn, but later decided ``I had to let go.''
   And besides, ``I'm still in the investment business, you know,''
he said.

   Sheboygan and Racine may learn in a few days
whether one of the two Lake Michigan communities will be the
setting for a new TV situation comedy starring James Naughton.
   Jane Anderson, producer of the series ``Raising Miranda,'' said
a film crew may arrive Tuesday for some test shots. CBS has
purchased the series for its autumn schedule, due to premiere Nov.
5.
   The series features a working-class father, played by Naughton,
who is trying to raise a teen-age daughter portrayed by Royanna
Black, a network newcomer.
   ``Right now, it's between Sheboygan and you,'' Ms. Anderson told
a reporter in a weekend telephone call from from her office in

   ``Whichever place we choose, it's important to understand that
we're not going to talk a lot about the city we're in. We're

   The Richard M. Nixon County Park apparently
impressed the former president, who has made a $5,000 donation.
   Nixon, who first visited the 143-acre park Aug. 23, made the
contribution to the York County Board Parks and Recreation, board
president the Rev. Carroll Luckenbaugh said Saturday.
   ``We're elated that he has been so impressed with the park when
he visited. We're really grateful,'' Luckenbaugh said.
   The funds are earmarked for a proposed $750,000 addition at the
park in this town situated between Harrisburg and Baltimore, he
said.
   Although it was Nixon's first visit to the park, it was not his
first contribution, officials said. Chief parks naturalist Kim
Young said ``he has supported us with donations throughout the
park's history.''

<HEAD>Former Members of Congress Reap Big Retirement Benefits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with Ralph Nader comment on wages.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired South Dakota congressman joins a
former Maine senator this month as the first members of Congress to
receive $1 million in government retirement pay, a taxpayers group
said Sunday.
   The National Taxpayers Union said former Rep. Ben Reifel will
receive a September pension check for $6,966, giving him more than
$1 million since he retired from Congress in 1971. The South Dakota
Republican served five terms in the House and receives $83,589
annually, the group said.
   In May, former Republican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith became the
first senator to get a millionaire pension, said David Keating,
executive vice president of the taxpayers group.
   ``While most Americans can only dream of a million dollars in
retirement income, dozens of retired legislators will soon become
pension millionaires,'' Keating said in a news release.
   The group said Mrs. Smith's annual pension is $88,715. She
retired in 1973 after more than 30 years in Congress and has
received $1,034,914 in retirement benefits, according to the group.
   In November, former Tennessee Sen. Albert A. Gore will receive a
check putting him over the $1 million mark, the group said. He
retired in 1971 after 32 years in the House and Senate and receives
an annual pension of $81,347.
   Reifel, Gore and Mrs. Smith each made $42,500 during their last
year in Congress. Current congressional salary is $89,500.
Congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula that
includes the average congressional salary over the last three years.
   The group said a proposed increase in congressional pay to
$135,000 next year would greatly increase the number of
million-dollar pensions.
   The taxpayers union, a non-profit organization that says it has
150,000 members interested in reducing government spending and
taxes, estimates that for every dollar paid in congressional
salaries, 35 cents is paid in congressional pension benefits.
   It says 85 percent of the retirement funds come from general
revenue because the 8 percent that representatives and senators pay
into their retirement fund is not enough to cover the benefits.
   Meanwhile, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said he was sending a
letter to all members of Congress on Labor Day reminding them that
the national minimum wage has not increased in seven years, while
their own salaries have gone up $28,838.
   ``Congress' reluctance to adjust the minimum wage is
particularly surprising in light of the diligence it has shown in
raising its own pay,'' Nader said in the letter made public Sunday.
   Nader noted that a worker earning the minimum wage of $3.53 an
hour would earn $6,960 annually, which is $4,600 below the poverty
level for a family of four.

<HEAD>Bakker Is Readying to Take Over PTL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. RIGSBY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker offered assurances Sunday he'll
have the money this week to back up his $165 million offer for PTL.
   Bakker said in a telephone interview from his Fort Mill office
that he has been working 15-hour days in anticipation of regaining
the TV ministry he left in 1987 in a sex and money scandal.
   ``We have made quite a few contacts'' with bankers, Bakker said.
``When the contracts (to take over PTL) are ready, we'll have the
money to back it up.''
   He said he hopes he and his wife, Tammy, will be back on the air
on Sept. 12.
   On Friday, PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said he
was ``very, very skeptical'' about whether Bakker would come up
with the cash to back up his offer. If Bakker does not have a $3
million letter of credit by Tuesday, Benton said, he will start
considering other offers for the ministry's assets.
   A least four other offers ranging from $113 million to $200
million have been made for PTL, officials said.
   Benton has a deadline of Saturday to present a buyer to U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds for approval. The evangelical
empire filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after the
scandal over Bakker's sexual liaison with Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker said working out deals with banks is especially difficult
during a holiday weekend, but a Midwestern bank, one in Atlanta and
another in Tennessee are interested in handling the funds from the
Greek investors he said are are backing his offer.
   Bakker declined to identify the investors or the banks.
   His lawyer, Jim Toms, said in a telephone interview from
Hendersonville, N.C., that some banks are leery of involvement
because of the controversy surrounding Bakker, but he feels certain
one will cooperate before the week ends.
   The evangelist said he's readying for the takeover by asking
experts for advice on such things as TV production, hotel
management, direct mailings, accounting and musical production.
   Bakker, who was defrocked by the Assemblies of God, said the
denomination has ``nothing to do with what we're doing.'' He said
he is an ordained minister of the Faith Christian Fellowship and
the new PTL will be under that church's guidance.
   He said that he knew some viewers have lost faith in him but
that his name recognition has increased dramatically since he left
the ministry and he expects to more than make up for the loss.
   ``Sure we have people who are turning their backs on us and will
turn their backs on us,'' he said. ``But we're known by so many
millions more. We're excited about it.''

<HEAD>Investigators Refuse to Comment on Double-Engine Failure Theory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No further briefings scheduled Sunday.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators wound up their
field work at the site of last week's Delta air crash Sunday,
refusing to comment on speculation that double engine failure might
have led to the disaster.
   The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous sources close to the
investigation, reported Sunday that investigators are trying to
determine whether two of the three engines on the Boeing 727 failed
in the seconds before Wednesday's crash.
   ``When someone says engine failure there are a whole host of
things that might mean,'' Lee Dickinson, a member of the NTSB, said
at a briefing Sunday. ``One of the things I will not do is
speculate on anything.''
   Some pilots said the fact that the wing flaps on the jet were
apparently retracted at the time of the crash, when they ordinarily
would have been extended for takeoff, may have been a sign the
pilots were trying to fly the plane on one engine, not a cause of
the crash, newspapers reported.
   Thirteen people were killed when Flight 1141 en route to Salt
Lake City crashed and burned seconds after takeoff at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport. Ninety-five people survived.
   A recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine
failure. Two loud pops were then heard, which could have indicated
a ``compressor stall.'' But Dickinson said a compressor stall,
which occurs when an engine is starving for air, is not critical.
``Keep in mind, compressor stall is not serious, it's a hiccup.''
   At the site Sunday, investigators sealed the cockpit in a blue
tarp. It will be taken to Delta headquarters in Atlanta where it
will be dismantled and studied.
   Workers used power saws to remove the landing gear beneath the
727 and also bored into the ground beneath the left wing to
determine the amount of fuel that may have spilled during the crash.
   Two surviving flight attendants were taken to the wreckage and
questioned by investigators, Dickinson said. He said he had no
immediate information on what they said.
   Dickinson said he planned to leave Dallas later Sunday, and only
a few investigators would remain as the center of the inquiry moves
to Washington.
   Meanwhile, NBC and The Washington Post reported that as the
plane taxied to the end of the runway, the cockpit crew spoke about
previous air crashes including the 1985 Delta Flight 191 crash that
killed 137 at the airport.
   The newspaper said the crew talked about recent reports about a
cockpit recording in the crash of a jet last November in Denver,
which revealed the crew members discussing a co-worker's dating
habits.
   NBC reported Saturday that the Delta crew members last week
joked that they should be careful since their comments could become
public if the plane crashed.
   Dickinson said Saturday night that he had not heard the cockpit
voice recording, but added ``if in our analysis we decide that's
pertinent information, we'll analyze it.''
   The role of the wing flaps, which are extended during takeoff to
provide added lift, continued to be discussed.
   Flight Engineer Stephen Judd has told investigators that the
wing flaps were extended in the proper position upon takeoff. But
evidence collected from the wreckage indicates the flaps were
completely or almost completely retracted.
   ``We have further verification that the flaps were retracted,''
Dickinson said Sunday.
   The Delta co-pilot, Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr., told
investigators Saturday that he did not remember anything from when
the plane left the gate, Dickinson said. Doctors said the pilot,
Capt. Larry Davis, was not well enough to be interviewed.
   Bill Melvin, a Dallas-based Delta pilot participating in the
crash investigation on behalf of the Air Line Pilots Association,
said he believes the pilot could have been facing engine failure
and decided to retract the flaps in a last-ditch effort to save the
plane.
   ``A 727 will still fly if it loses one engine, but all 727
pilots know if you lose two engines, the only way you can fly the
plane off is to get rid of the flaps,'' Melvin told the Dallas
Times Herald, noting the manuever is not approved emergency
procedure. ``With two engines out, there's only one way that plane
could fly _ with the flaps up.''
   Dickinson said he didn't know what the procedure for the pilot
would have been if both engines failed. ``Each airline has
different operations. As you know, we will be documenting Delta's
procedure.''

   Heads Heads are are spinning spinning in
northern New Jersey after this weekend's 54th annual International
Twins Association convention.
   Cynthia Apacible at the hospitality desk at the Meadowlands
Hilton said the staff was slowly becoming accustomed to the sight
of 150 sets of twins _ 150 sets of twins _ roaming the lobby.
   ``The first day we all tried to figure out the differences
between them,'' said Ms. Apacible. ``I'm married to a fraternal
twin but I can't tell the difference on some of these people.''
   On Friday, the twins toured New York Harbor aboard the cruise
ship ``Spirit of New York.''
   ``The crew on the cruise ship was really freaking out,'' said
Cary Clark, 24, who is actually a triplet from Edmund, Okla. ``The
ones who are identical also dress alike. The bus drivers were all
pretty fascinated.''
   For Kathleen and Irene Grider, being identical twins and having
names that rhymed wasn't enough. The sisters from Durant, Okla.,
were singers in a country western band and married two band members
who were brothers.
   They still live next to each other and both have seven children.

   Thousands marched in a Serbian city
Sunday to protest alleged harassment by ethnic Albanians in the
southern province of Kosovo, one of four weekend rallies that drew
more than 100,000, news reports said.
   Serbs and Montenegrins rallied in four cities during the weekend
to protest discrimination against non-Albanians in the province.
   More than 10,000 people, including a few hundred Serbs and
Montenegrins from Kosovo, held a rally Sunday in Crvenka in
Vojvodina province about 125 miles northwest of Belgrade, the state
news agency Tanjug reported.
   Demonstrators shouted ``give us weapons, we go to Kosovo'' and
``army to Kosovo'' at the weekend rallies, the reports said.
   Some shouted ``an end to genocide,'' referring to their
increasing accusations of persecution of Serbs and Montenegrins in
Kosovo, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
   According to official statistics, more than 34,000 Slavs have
left Kosovo since bloody riots in 1981, when the government said
nine people were killed.
   Albanians in Kosovo contend, however, that economic problems are
the main factor forcing emigration.
   Some people at the rally in Crvenka sang a song in praise of
Serbian Communist Party chief Slobodan Milosevic. Milosevic wants
to increase his republic's control over the nominally autonomous
provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, and many Serbs and Montenegrins
have welcomed the idea as a way of promoting their rights.
   At the largest demonstration of the weekend, nearly 70,000
rallied Saturday at Smederevo, about 30 miles south of Belgrade,
Tanjug said. About 20,000 Serbs have migrated to Smederevo from
Kosovo since World War II.
   A second rally Saturday brought together more than 20,000 people
at Kovin on the Danube opposite Smederevo, and about 2,000 others
demonstrated at Sombor, about 90 miles northwest of Belgrade, the
news agency said.
   The rallies defy pleas from national Communist Party leaders to
refrain from taking the Kosovo conflict to the streets.

   Rain fell over much of the eastern third of the nation Sunday,
with heavy rain in the Gulf states, and the West Coast was
unseasonably hot.
   By Sunday afternoon, more than 5 inches of rain had fallen at
Meridian, Miss., since Saturday afternoon. During the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT, 3.01 inches of rain fell at Meridian, with 1.87
inches at Mobile, Ala.
   Locally heavy rain over two days saturated the ground of
southeastern Louisiana, and some rivers and bayous north of Lake
Pontchartrain were expected to rise to a few feet above flood stage
during the next few days.
   Rain fell throughout the East Coast states ahead of a cold front
in the Appalachians. Rain was widespread from New England to
Virginia and rain and scattered thunderstorms extended southward
toward the eastern Gulf Coast states.
   One to 3 inches of rain fell in northeastern Tennessee and
southwestern Virginia, with more than 4 inches in Wise County, Va.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed under an upper level
low pressure system over Ohio, Lower Michigan, northern Indiana and
Illinois.
   Heavy rain on Saturday caused the Rolling Fork River at Boston,
Ky., to rise more than 27 feet in 24 hours. It was expected to
crest just over flood stage Monday with only minor flooding.
   Strong high pressure over the West combined with an offshore
flow to produce scorching temperatures along coastal sections of
southern California.
   Los Angeles reached 105 degrees by noon PDT and San Diego warmed
to a record 104, temperatures between 20 and 25 degrees above the
normal highs for this time of the year. Fullerton had the highest
reading in the Los Angeles area at noon at 108.
   As far north as the northern end of the San Joaquin Valley,
Redding, Calif., hit 105 degrees by noon.
   Hurricane Uleki was more than 300 miles southwest of Honolulu
and began to move to the west.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to the 108 at Fullerton. Sunday
morning's low was 30 at Estes Park, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers were forecast from the Great Lakes
across the upper Ohio Valley to the northern and middle Atlantic
Coast states. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over eastern sections of the Carolinas across southern Georgia to
Florida and the central Gulf Coast region. Widely scattered
thunderstorms were forecast over the lower Rio Grande Valley of
southern Texas and the mountains of the Southwest.
   Highs in the upper 50s were predicted over northern Michigan; in
the 60s from the upper Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes to
sections of New York and Pennsylvania; in the 90s over sections of
Florida and Texas; in the 80s and 90s over much of the western
third of the nation; well over 100 across the desert Southwest, and
in much of California; and in the 70s and 80s across most remaining
areas between the Rockies and the East Coast.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Leader Says Cubans Adding Troops, Planning Offensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Angola's
anti-communist rebels claimed Cuba now has 60,000 troops in Angola
and is planning to attack his guerrilla forces within days.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said Cuba has sent 10,000 more
soldiers to Angola in recent weeks and the Cuban-Angolan forces
have used a recent cease-fire to move farther south in Angola and
position themselves for an offensive.
   ``There are now 60,000 Cubans in Angola and they are prepared to
launch attacks within days,'' Savimbi said. ``The Cubans didn't
come here to wave goodbye. It is an initiative for an offensive.''
   Savimbi made his comments Saturday at his headquarters in Jamba,
a rebel stronghold in southern Angola. The Associated Press in
Johannesburg received a videotape of his remarks.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa agreed on Aug. 8 to a cease-fire
in Angola's civil war as part of a regional peace initiative, but
Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
known as UNITA, did not participate in the negotiations.
   Portugal granted Angola independence in 1975 and the Marxist
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola defeated UNITA
fighters in a battle for power.
   UNITA, with U.S. and South African backing, then began a
guerrilla campaign and Cuba sent troops to the southern African
country to help the government.
   Savimbi has said his guerrillas will continue the war because
they were not included in the cease-fire talks that were mediated
by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker.
   Some U.S. officials in Washington last week told The Associated
Press that Cuba had increased its troop strength in Angola to
60,000, but the U.S. State Department said Friday it still
estimated the Cuban forces at 50,000.
   A new round of peace talks between South Africa, Cuba, Angola
and U.S. mediators is scheduled this week in Brazzaville, Congo.
   South Africa said Tuesday that it had withdrawn all of its
forces from Angola.
   It also said it is prepared to begin withdrawing its troops from
South-West Africa on Nov. 1 and to allow the territory to hold
independence elections next June 1 if the Cubans are out of Angola
by June. Sources involved in the last round of negotiations said
the Cubans offered to withdraw from Angola over a 24-month period.
   South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, is located between
Angola and South Africa and has been administered by South Africa's
white-controlled government since the end of World War I under a
mandate of the defunct League of Nations. The United Nations
repudiated that mandate but South Africa has rejected U.N.
resolutions calling for immediate independence for the territory.
   South Africa, with U.S. backing, has insisted that the Cuban
forces must first withdraw from Angola.
   Savimbi called the talks dealing with the withdrawal of Cuban
and South African troops from Angola ``a cosmetic solution to peace
when (the participants) know they are going to leave behind a war.''
   He said he supported U.S. efforts to end the 13-year-old
conflict but claimed Crocker was ``giving all the cards'' to the
Angolan government.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis' nearly 2-1
early summer lead over Republican George Bush in Iowa has
disappeared, according to a statewide poll released Sunday.
   The Des Moines Register's telephone survey of 687 likely voters
found 47 percent supporting Dukakis and 42 percent backing Bush, a
difference almost erased by the poll's 3.8 percentage point margin
of error. Eleven percent remain undecided.
   Last June, Dukakis led Bush 60 percent to 28 percent.
   Eighty-five percent of those surveyed who said they were
Republicans said they favor Bush, compared to 73 percent in a
similar poll last June.
   A much larger swing occurred among voters aged 18 to 24, who now
favor Bush by a 57-39 percent margin. In June, this group favored
Dukakis by a 70-25 percent margin.
   The poll was conducted Aug. 29-31.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis are
locked in a dead heat in Delaware where more than a quarter of the
registered voters surveyed remain undecided, according to a
newspaper poll released Sunday.
   The Wilmington News-Journal survey of 1,824 registered voters
showed Bush leading Dukakis 38 percent to 34 percent with 28
percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points, negating the Bush lead.
   The University of Delaware's College of Urban Affairs conducted
the survey for the newspaper Aug. 19-26.

   Republican nominee George Bush holds a
commanding lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis in the latest survey
of registered voters in Alabama, says a poll released Sunday.
   Bush is the favorite of slightly more than half of the 502
voters surveyed _ 50.7 percent _ while Dukakis is the choice of 34
percent, according to The Birmingham News. Twelve percent said they
remain undecided and three percent said they did not plan to vote.
   The telephone survey, conducted Aug. 27-31, has a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   Southern Opinion Research conducted the poll for the newspaper.
   The survey also found that 38 percent believe that Democratic
vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen is qualified to be
president while 26.1 percent think Republican running mate Dan
Quayle has the skills and experience to run the country.
   Thirty percent, however, said they felt ``positive'' about
Quayle while 21.2 percent said they felt the same way about Bentsen.

<HEAD>Two Visions of Vermont Collide in Debate Over Barn Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CRAFTSBURY COMMON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two visions of Vermont have
collided in this picturesque hilltop village of austere white
buildings and a village green.
   One has to do with polished antiques, fine food and weekends of
leisure in the countryside; the other has to do with morning
chores, rutted pastures and muddy shoes.
   The dispute is being aired in hearing rooms and involves an
effort by a small college here to build a genuine livestock barn
within sight of the manicured English gardens of the Inn on the
Common, with its croquet lawn, clay tennis court and Adirondack
chairs from which guests take in the panoramic view.
   ``People come here for peace and quiet. They don't come here to
be put in the middle of a farm yard,'' said Michael Schmitt, who
with his wife, Penny, opened the inn 14 years ago after leaving
their jobs in New York in investment banking and advertising.
   Students at Sterling College, a 75-student school offering
programs in farming and forestry served up with a back-to-the-land
ethic, are erecting a barn whose rafters can be seen from the Inn's
garden.
   The Schmitts' opposition to the barn and a second one planned
nearby was dismissed recently by the District 7 Environmental
Commission, based in St. Johnsbury. But they have appealed to the
state Environmental Board.
   Mrs. Schmitt said the barn violates the artistic intent of the
inn, whose gardens were built in the 1930s and are part of a
historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``The idea is to create not just pretty flower clumps but to
create a total outdoor room, if you will,'' she said.
   ``We are not anti-farming,'' she said. ``This is not a farm
versus tourism issue. Tourism and farming are bound together in
Vermont. People come to Vermont to look at the beautiful farms and
fields.''
   A Vermont view can contain barns, she said, ``but you do what is
appropriate where you find it.''
   Construction permits are granted in Vermont under a 1970
development control law written to preserve the state's rural
character. A District 7 commission member said this is the first
time in his memory that the law has been used to oppose
construction of barns.
   Sterling College President Robert Cowen said the school needs
the barns to continue its agricultural programs.
   ``We have tried to do this with the least negative impact as
possible on our neighbors,'' he said.
   In its ruling, the District Commission dismissed the Schmitts'
concerns about barnyard noises, smells and insects wafting over a
fence and onto their property. The barn is about 800 feet from the
inn.
   ``Although animals may occasionally be heard at the Inn and at
area residences, this noise will be similar to the sounds produced
by other farming operations in the area,'' the commission wrote.
   Legally, construction can go on during the Schmitts' appeal to
the state Environmental Board. But the college is proceeding at its
own risk.
   On the issue of aesthetics, the commission applied a test in
Vermont law that bars projects having an ``undue adverse impact.''
It found that while the impact of the barns would be adverse, it
would not be undue.

<HEAD>Study: Sweatshops Not A Thing Of The Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweatshops continue to exist in the United
States, with businesses in the restaurant, apparel manufacturing
and meat-processing industries the worst offenders, said a
government report released Sunday.
   The General Accounting Office report said Hispanics and Asians
were the ethnic groups most heavily represented among workers in
restaurant and apparel sweatshops.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, based its assessment
on interviews with more than 100 federal and state officials
nationwide surveyed between January and May 1988.
   The report said some of the reasons cited for multiple labor-law
violations were similar to those that existed in the 19th century:
a large immigrant work force and low profit margins in
labor-intensive industries.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who requested the GAO study,
said the results show ``the ugly side of the Reagan legacy.
   ``I think most Americans believe sweatshops vanished generations
ago, but they are here today, in all parts of the country,'' he
said in a statement released with the report.
   Schumer supported the report's conclusion that penalties for
labor law violations must be increased to deter abuses.
   ``As it stands, employers can violate the minimum wage law and
if they get caught they only repay lost wages,'' the New York
congressman said. ``Right now, the penalties aren't even a slap on
the wrist, they are more like a knowing wink.''
   The GAO described a sweatshop, a term not defined in federal law
or regulations, as ``a business that regularly violates both wage
or child labor and safety or health laws.''
   The agency excluded from its study industries such as
construction and agriculture where work is performed outside of
enclosed structures. It also excluded work done in employees' homes.
   The agency said it received responses to its survey from
officials in the District of Columbia and all states except Oregon.
The GAO also surveyed federal officials: 10 regional administrators
of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division, 10 Occupational
Safety and Health Administration regional officials, and 33
Immigration and Naturalization Service district directors.
   The restaurant, apparel manufacturing and meat-processing
industries were most often cited by these officials as having the
most serious problems with labor law violations, the GAO said.
Other industries cited were hotel and motel maid services, security
agencies, footwear and supermarkets.
   Officials reported problems in every state except Alaska and
Hawaii.
   The results of the surveys ``suggest that many workers may be
underpaid and working in unsafe or unhealthy conditions,'' the GAO
said.
   The agency gave no estimate of the total number of workers
affected, but said one respondent estimated that half of the
approximately 5,000 restaurants in Chicago, employing about 25,000
people, were chronic labor law violators. Another respondent
estimated that 25 percent of the 100 apparel manufacturing firms in
New Orleans, employing about 5,000 workers, are violating labor
laws.
   The officials said problems in the apparel manufacturing and
restaurant industries have not improved or have become more serious
in the past decade.
   The report said officials estimated Hispanics represented an
average of 53 percent of workers in restaurant sweatshops and an
average of 60 percent of workers in apparel manufacturing shops
that are chronic labor law violators. The comparable figures for
Asians were 25 percent in restaurants and 35 percent in apparel.
   Examples of the violations found include failure to keep
required records of wages, hours worked and injuries; wages below
the minimum wage, which currently is $3.35 per hour, or failure to
pay overtime; illegal work by minors; fire hazards; and work
procedures that cause crippling illnesses, the GAO said.
   The report said limited coordination among enforcement agencies,
too few inspectors and inadequate penalties for violations limit
efforts to enforce labor laws.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Voters Know Little of Bush, Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the presidential election nine weeks off,
sizable numbers of likely voters say they don't know much about the
candidates and feel the contenders are avoiding the issues, Time
magazine reported Sunday.
   A poll conducted for the magazine last week found improvement in
Republican George Bush's ratings for trustworthiness and
reliability and declines for Democrat Michael Dukakis in terms of
trustworthiness and experience.
   Overall, 47 percent of the 1,103 likely voters nationwide
favored Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, to
42 percent for Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. The margin
of error was three points, meaning the race statistically was a
dead heat.
   That result was among voters who are registered and considered
likely to vote. Among all registered voters _ 1,474 of them in the
poll _ the race was even tighter: 44 percent for the Republicans,
42 percent for the Democrats.
   Time's survey, conducted Thursday and Friday, found that public
opinion remained largely unformed about the candidates as the
campaign enters its final stretch, and large swings in support
remained possible. A fifth of the likely voters backing each ticket
said they might change their minds.
   Fully 50 percent of the likely voters said they knew ``not much
at all'' about Dukakis and what kind of president he would be, and
29 percent said that about Bush, despite Bush's nearly eight-year
tenure as vice president.
   About half the likely voters said Bush was ``avoiding the real
issues,'' and nearly as many, 44 percent, said that of Dukakis.
   But Bush, who caught up in the polls with Dukakis after the
Republican convention last month, was rated favorably by 58 percent
of the likely voters, compared to a 49 percent favorable rating for
Dukakis. Each of the men was rated unfavorably by a third of the
likely voters.
   Moreover, 58 percent rated Bush as ``someone you can trust,'' up
from 48 percent in a Time poll in April, and 60 percent said Bush
could handle an international crisis, up from 51 percent in April.
   Fifty-three percent rated Dukakis as trustworthy, down from 61
percent in April, and 43 percent said he has the experience to be
president, down from 53 percent in April.
   Bush was rated far better on experience _ 83 percent _ and
Dukakis was viewed as reliable in a crisis by just 40 percent.
However, 72 percent said Dukakis cares about average Americans; 57
percent said so of Bush.
   Forty percent in the survey rated Dukakis as ``too liberal,''
indicating that Bush's attacks on ideological grounds have had some
effect.
   But while Bush has tied himself to President Reagan's record, 51
percent in the poll said they wanted the next president to ``follow
different policies,'' to 42 percent who favored continuing Reagan's
policies.

   A Coast Guard icebreaker early Sunday
freed an oil company research-support vessel stranded in arctic
ice, hours after a ship carrying intellectuals on an educational
journey got free of the ice by itself, authorities said.
   The icebreaker Polar Star had been in the Arctic Ocean on a
mapping mission when it was diverted last week to help the cruise
ship Society Explorer, which was hemmed in by the ice.
   The cruise ship worked free of the ice, but meanwhile the Amoco
vessel, the Shaleen Nicholas, reported it was hemmed in about 30
miles southeast of Point Barrow.
   Coast Guard Lt. Greg Stewart in Juneau said the Polar Star
reached the Amoco vessel at about 7 a.m. Sunday and broke it free.
   The Society Explorer, which had 149 passengers and crew members
aboard, is operated by Society Expeditions Cruises of Seattle,
which specializes in journeys to unconventional destinations,
including Antarctica, and emphasizes libraries and lectures.
   The captain of the ship requested help Thursday when the ship
was near Point Barrow. A day later, the Shaleen Nicholas reported
it also was caught in the Beaufort ice.
   The Coast Guard said crews reported no danger related to the ice
problem. Officials had said the ice is unusually prevalent for this
time of year.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush rested up Sunday for the
traditional Labor Day kickoff of the presidential campaign while
GOP vice presidential contender Dan Quayle stumped in the South,
telling stock car drivers what the candidates soon will hear _
``Gentlemen, start your engines.''
   Quayle ended his Southern swing with a rally in Richmond, Va.,
where he told the crowd, ``the South is going for George Bush.''
   ``I can't tell you what an upbeat feeling we have had on that
Southern swing,'' Quayle said. ``We're going all the way to the
White House because we are the party of the future.''
   Quayle, on his second solo campaign trip, visited Louisiana,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and
Virginia before traveling to Newark, N.J., for a Labor Day
appearance at Liberty Island.
   Democratic nominee Dukakis spent Sunday in Boston, preparing for
a Labor Day tour that includes stops in Philadelphia, Detroit, St.
Louis and Chicago.
   The vice president relaxed in Washington D.C. before embarking
on a West Coast trip to Oregon, Washington and the biggest
electoral prize _ California with its 47 votes.
   Bush received encouraging news from the latest Time Magazine
poll of 1,103 likely voters nationwide, which found that 47 percent
favor the Republican ticket while 42 percent prefer the Democrats.
The margin of error was three points, meaning the race
statistically was a dead heat.
   The survey, conducted Thursday and Friday, also found that
public opinion about the candidates remained largely unformed, and
major swings in the support remained possible.
   Bush, who caught up in the polls with Dukakis after the
Republican convention last month, was rated favorably by 58 percent
of the likely voters, compared to a 49 percent favorable rating for
Dukakis. Each of the men was rated unfavorably by a third of the
likely voters.
   Although the Republican nominee took a respite from campaigning,
two of his surrogates used television appearances to lash out at
Dukakis' record on education and labor.
   Education Secretary William Bennett, in an appearance on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said Dukakis is a member of an elitist
Massachusetts crowd that has ``disdain for the simple and basic
patriotism of most Americans,'' including the reciting of the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   Bennett said the pledge is ``the ABCs of education,'' and added:
``If you have trouble with the pledge, you're going to have trouble
with a lot of things down the road.''
   In 1977, Dukakis vetoed legislation requiring mandatory
recitation of the pledge in public schools after Massachusetts'
highest court, citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent, said the
legislation was unconstitutional.
   Last month, Dukakis defended his decision, saying that although
he encourages children to say the pledge the issue centered on the
measure's constitutionality.
   Bennett said he lived in that ``Brookline-Cambridge world for
eight years,'' referring to Dukakis' hometown and the site of
Harvard University. ``These are people who don't like things like
the pledge. They have disdain for the simple and basic patriotism
of most Americans.''
   Asked if he was accusing Dukakis of disdain for patriotism,
Bennett said, ``I think the crowd with which he runs ... do think
they are smarter. You know, they have these advanced attitudes.
They don't like what most Americans think and believe.''
   Bennett's comments drew cries of foul from former Democratic
candidate Paul Simon, who described himself as Dukakis' point man
on education, and officials in Brookline.
   ``George Bush as education president would be easier to believe
if he had been an education vice president,'' Simon said in a
statement. ``There's no evidence George Bush ever raised his voice,
picked up a phone, or lifted a finger to protest the miserable
education record of this administration.''
   Jeffrey Allen, chairman of the Brookline Board of Selectmen,
demanded an apology from Bennett.
   ``My reaction is one of outrage that the secretary of education
on national television sees fit to question the patriotism and
committment to this nation of a town of 59,000 people,'' Allen said
Sunday afternoon.
   ``I believe he owes this town an apology,'' he said.
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, who appeared on ABC-TV's ``This
Week With David Brinkley,'' said she did not see plans that Dukakis
has had in Massachusetts ``that are transferrable to the nation at
large.''
   Bush's running mate took a break from touting the Republican
ticket and criticizing the Democrats. Indiana Sen. Quayle attended
the Southern 500 stock car race in Darlington, S.C., where he was
given the honor of telling the drivers: ``Gentlemen, start your
engines.''
   At the opening ceremonies of the race, he received a smattering
of boos from the audience when he was introduced.
   Later Sunday, Quayle attended a private fund-raiser in Richmond
and flew on to Newark where he prepared for the speech he will give
Monday morning in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.
   Labor Day marks the official countdown to the November election
but political events, including the furor over the selection of
Quayle, forced the candidates to start in earnest earlier this year.
   The contest remains close as reflected in three state polls
released Sunday.
   In Iowa, Dukakis' nearly 2-1 early summer lead has disappeared
and he now leads Bush, 47-42 percent. The Des Moines Register poll
of 687 likely voters, conducted Aug. 23-31, had a margin of error
of 3.8 percentage points.
   In the same poll taken in June, Dukakis led Bush by a 60-28
percent margin.
   In a survey conducted for the Wilmington News-Journal papers in
Delaware, Bush led Dukakis 38 percent to 34 percent with 28 percent
of the 1,824 registered voters undecided. The poll, conducted Aug.
19-26, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   Bush also led Dukakis in a poll of 502 registered voters in
Alabama. The survey for the Birmingham News found Bush favored by
50.7 percent and Dukakis by 34 percent. The survey, with a margin
of error of 5 percentage points, was conducted Aug. 27-31.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A smokeless cigarette that R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. plans to test market apparently is not for
everyone.
   ``It smells like a tennis shoe burning,'' said Tom Martin of
Danville, Va., who took a puff during an informal taste test last
week. ``A Reebok.''
   ``Woody,'' added Shawn Evans of Columbus, Ohio.
   The unscientific survey was conducted by the Winston-Salem
Journal.
   Reynolds Tobacco announced last week it would begin
test-marketing the cigarette, called Premier, Oct. 1 in St. Louis,
and in the Arizona cities of Phoenix and Tucson.
   Reynolds, one of the nation's largest cigarette manufacturers
and a subsidiary of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco Inc., began selling
the new brand last week to distributors, supermarkets and discount
chains in the three cities.
   Company spokesmen say the product simulates smoking by heating a
capsule containing tobacco flavor pellets instead of tobacco. When
a smoker lights the cigarette, heat filters through the pellets and
the little bit of tobacco packed around the unit.
   It produces no odor and only a trace of ash or smoke that could
irritate people nearby, the company says. It also reportedly
contains fewer of what Reynolds calls ``controversial compounds,''
the hazardous byproducts associated with cigarette smoke.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Appeal Deportation Orders At Public Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Palestinians fighting
deportation orders pleaded their case Sunday in an open hearing _
the first time the army permitted the public to attend an appeals
session.
   Defense lawyers lauded the army's decision but said due process
was still being violated because prosecutors could submit ``secret
evidence'' without having to show it to the defense.
   Said Barakat, 32, a Moslem fundamentalist leader, and Riad
Adjour, 26, accused of being a PLO activist, are among 25
Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
fighting deportation orders issued last month.
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories, Israel has expelled 33 Arabs. The practice
has been denounced by the United States and other Western nations
as violating international human rights conventions.
   ``There is no hope, no justice for me here, but I don't want to
go without fighting,'' Barakat told the tribunal.
   The hearing before a three-member military review committee took
place at the army's Gaza City headquarters and was attended by
three journalists and about two dozen relatives of the defendants.
   Barakat and Adjour sat quietly on a wooden bench as the
prosecutor, Capt. Meir Klinger, read the charges against them.
   Klinger said Barakat, a high school teacher from the Gaza Strip
town of Bani Suheila, was a chief ideologust of Islamic Jihad, a
Moslem fundamentalist organization pledged to the destruction of
Israel.
   He also said that Barakat, who was arrested May 11, signed a
15-page statement in which he acknowledged writing underground
leaflets inciting anti-Israeli violence.
   ``We had enough evidence to put him on trial,'' Klinger told the
panel. ``Instead, we decided to deport him because experience has
shown that fanatic Islamic leaders usually continue their hostile
activities in jail.''
   The prosecutor said Adjour was a Palistine Liberation
Organization activist who led outlawed ``popular committees'' of
Palistinian miliants in the Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City.
Klinger claimed Adjour distributed PLO funds and ordered the
burnings of stores whose owners ignored strike orders.
   In both cases Klinger submitted ``secret evidence,'' which
usually involves reports by Israel's Shin Bet security service. The
defense is barred from seeing such evidence on security grounds.
   ``You can't argue against secret evidence,'' said Fayez Abu
Rahme, one of the defense lawyers and head of the Gaza Lawyers
Association.
   After defense lawyers present their case in a separate session
the review panel will issue its recommendations. If it upholds the
deportation orders the defendants can appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Neither the review committee nor the Supreme Court has struck
down a deportation order since the uprising began.
   An Israeli lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested
the hearings were opened to the public to provide more legitimacy
to the proceedings and defuse international criticism.
   But the defense lawyers expressed concern that Israel was
setting the stage for mass deportations.
   ``They used to deport just the leaders, now they're deporting
the small fish,'' said Tamar Pelleg, a lawyer representing Adjour
on behalf of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. She noted
that Adjour had not been arrested previously.

   Education Secretary William Bennett on Sunday
accused Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis of
running with a crowd that has ``disdain for the simple and basic
patriotism of most Americans.''
   Bennett, who leaves the Reagan administration later this month,
vowed to dog Dukakis on educational issues and accused the
Massachusetts governor of offering only ``empty, general, bland
platitudes'' on education.
   Speaking on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' Bennett said Dukakis's
record on education consists of his ``veto of the Pledge of
Allegiance.'' In 1977, the Massachusetts governor vetoed a measure
requiring mandatory recitation of the pledge in public schools
after the state's highest court, citing U.S. Supreme Court
precedent, said the legislation was unconstitutional.
   ``I encourage children to say the Pledge of Allegiance,''
Dukakis said during a campaign stop last month. ``I say the Pledge
of Allegiance. That's not the issue. The Republicans know it. ...
That law was unconstitutional.''
   Bennett called the pledge ``the ABCs of education,'' adding,
``If you have trouble with the pledge, you're going to have trouble
with a lot of things down the road.''
   ``I lived in that Brookline-Cambridge world for eight years,''
he said, referring to the town where Dukakis lives and the site of
Harvard University. ``These are people who don't like things like
the pledge. They have disdain for the simple and basic patriotism
of most Americans,'' said Bennett.
   Asked if he was accusing Dukakis of having disdain for
patriotism, Bennett said, ``I think the crowd with which he runs
... do think they are smarter. You know, they have these advanced
attitudes. They don't like what most Americans think and believe.''
   Jeffrey Allen, chairman of the Brookline Board of Selectmen,
later expressed ``outrage that the secretary of education on
national television sees fit to question the patriotism and
commitment to this nation of a town of 59,000 people.''
   ``I believe he owes this town an apology,'' Allen said.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, Dukakis' point man on
education issues, responded to Bennett's comments with a critique
of George Bush's track record on education.
   ``There's no evidence George Bush ever raised his voice, picked
up a phone, or lifted a finger to protest the miserable education
record of this administration,'' Simon said.
   Bennett defended his political statements as consistent with
positions he has taken as education secretary and said the Bush
campaign paid for his recent trip to California where he attacked
Dukakis on education.
   ``I think what George Bush is talking about is going to keep the
educational reform movement moving. What Mike Dukakis is talking
about is empty, general, bland platitudes,'' Bennett said.

<HEAD>Medical Experts Warn Of Venereal Disease Spread</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venereal diseases have spread to every city in
China and medical experts are calling for more action to fight the
worsening problem, an official report said Sunday.
   The daily newspaper Health News said the number of VD patients
has increased steadily since the late 1970s, when China began
opening its doors to foreigners.
   It said the problem has spread from a few coastal cities, which
have more contacts with foreigners, to almost every city in the
country.
   In southern China's Canton, the number of VD victims, most of
whom were under the age of 20, quadrupled in 1987 from the previous
year, the paper said.
   The report blamed the spread of the diseases to the closing of
VD clinics in the early 1960s _ when venereal diseases were
virtually wiped out _ and to the lack of education about the
diseases, backward medical equipment and treatment, and lax
enforcement of the ban on prostitution.
   It suggested that a national body with representatives from
public security, the judiciary, civil affairs, the women's
federation, the tourist industry and the public health sector be
set up to prevent and treat venereal diseases.
   Laws and regulations should be tightened to ban prostitution,
and sufferers should be compelled to get medical treatment, the
paper said.

   A pregnant Florida mastiff bat, a
species biologists feared was extinct, was in good condition Sunday
and ``eating like a little pig,'' a student veterinarian said.
   The 5{-inch, 1 1-3 ounce, furball was found weak and dehydrated
last week on the balcony of a Coral Gables company. Thrilled
biologists took the bat to an animal clinic, where it was nursed
back to health.
   The pregnancy thrilled experts because the species had not been
spotted in southeastern Florida in 10 years, and some biologists
worried that the animals existed no more.
   The Florida mastiff is only found in this region.
   Veterinarian Theresa Parrott is keeping the bat at her home,
where it is fed worms.
   ``She's eating like a little pig,'' said Ms. Parrott's
assistant, Pam Lynch.

   Residents frustrated by the city's failure
to clean up their neighborhood flipped some abandoned cars over and
pushed others into intersections, and one of the 23 vehicles caught
fire, police said.
   Angry residents of the impoverished north side neighborhood took
to the streets in a frenzy of protest Saturday when city trash
trucks drove by without picking up garbage from a cleanup effort,
police said.
   Capt. Gerald Baker said police were looking for the group of 15
or so men involved in the spree, but no arrests had been made by
Sunday morning. No injuries were reported.
   The protest was apparently triggered by the botched cleanup
effort and frustration over the hundreds of abandoned cars that
litter the area's streets and never get towed.
   ``There's cars here for six months,'' said neighbor Stella
Martin. ``You call and you call and nothing gets done. They were
told the only way the city would pick up the abandoned cars was if
they're in the middle of the streets.''

<HEAD>Aquino Says People Oppose Return of Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
that many Filipinos oppose the return of ousted ruler Ferdinand
Marcos and have vowed to hold demonstrations if he comes back.
   In her weekly radio program, Mrs. Aquino said her government
would comply if the courts ruled that Marcos could return from
exile in Hawaii. But she said there has been no such ruling because
no criminal charges have been filed against him.
   A military-civilian uprising in February 1986 ousted Marcos and
carried Mrs. Aquino to power. Two weeks ago, Marcos filed a
petition with a Manila court asking that he be allowed to return
and confront a former Cabinet member scheduled to testify in
November on alleged corruption during the his 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return, citing
national security.
   ``Many people have sent letters and called up on the phone to
tell me that they don't want Ferdinand Marcos to come back yet,''
she said Sunday. ``Some people have sent word to me that they would
go out into the streets to protest the return of Marcos.''
   The government has been seeking to recover up to $10 billion
that it claims Marcos and his associates plundered from the country
but it has not filed criminal charges against Marcos. Under
Philippine law, a defendant's presence is required in criminal
proceedings.
   ``Since no criminal charges have been filed against the former
president, there is really no necessity yet for the courts to
probably call for him,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Marcos had filed the petition seeking to return after the
anti-corruption court granted the solicitor-general's request for a
special hearing to ``perpetuate'' the testimony of former Public
Works Secretary Baltazar Aquino.
   Baltazar Aquino, who is not related to the president, had served
in Marcos' Cabinet. Government lawyers have said he will testify
about millions of dollars Marcos allegedly received in kickbacks
from Japanese firms. The lawyers said Baltazar Aquino's testimony
must be taken soon because he is ill.
   The court did say Marcos has the right to defend himself in the
proceedings that will begin Nov. 7 because the solicitor-general
declared he intended to use testimony in the hearing in a future
criminal suit against Marcos.
   The government has asked the court to reject Marcos' petition.
On Thursday the court gave Marcos 10 days to submit a written reply
to the government's motion.

   Who's the sexiest man alive? It's John F.

   The 27-year-old son of President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis was given the title in the magazine's Sept. 12 issue.
   Kennedy has ``his mother's dark eyes and his father's striking

   Kennedy, a law student at New York University, keeps in shape by
working out at a $6,000-a-year fitness club, hiking and playing
ball in Central Park.
   The magazine reports that friends say Kennedy is a lovable ham
who was ``one of the guys'' at the California law firm where he had
a $1,100-a-week summer job.
   What about the future?
   Sen. Edward Kennedy said he believes his nephew one day will be

   ``Not necessarily running for office, but trying to make some

   A Trans World Airlines passenger jet aborted

   Flight 846 to Boston never left the runway, and no injuries were

officer for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The Lockheed L-1011, carrying an unknown number of passengers
and crew, was rolling toward takeoff when the pilot ``indicated to
the tower that they were slow to accelerate'' and decided not to
depart, Hallen said.
   ``He requested emergency equipment just in the event that they
may have had hot brakes (from slowing down),'' the officer said.
   The equipment was not needed and the plane returned to its gate,
Hallen said.
   The cause of the incident was under investigation, he added.
   TWA officials could not be reached immediately for comment.
   The L-1011 is a three-engine aircraft that can carry from 250 to
400 passengers.

<HEAD>U.N. Mediator Says No Plans For Recess In Iran-Iraq Talks.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. mediator in the Iran-Iraq peace talks
said Sunday there are no plans to recess the talks despite bitter
disputes between the Persian Gulf neighbors.
   But Jan Eliasson, speaking at a news conference, said he was
having ``informal contacts'' with both delegations but declined to
give details about the talks, now in their 11th day.
   Foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of
Iraq have not met face-to-face since the second day of the
negotiations. Instead, delegates from both sides, with or without
the ministers, have held separate meetings with U.N.
representatives.
   ``There's no recess planned for the time being,'' Eliasson said.
``We are in this intensive working phase and I am hopeful and
expect progress on the issues we discuss.''
   The Geneva talks are to arrange follow-up procedures for the
cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20 after nearly eight years of
fighting. The talks have bogged down over disagreements about troop
withdrawals and the Shatt-al-Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq
that leads into the northern gulf.
   Eliasson, who was appointed mediator on Thursday, was asked if
there had been any progress in the negotiations.
   He said ``to me it is progress that both sides sit in a meeting,
discuss problems of substance, and characterize the talks as
businesslike and constructive.''
   Aziz, after meeting with Eliasson Saturday, said the talks were
``still in square one'' and he again blamed Iran for the stalemate.
   Both sides have accused each other of violating the cease-fire
and Eliasson said the complaints had been submitted to U.N.
officials in Iran and Iraq ``but we haven't received any feedback
from them yet.''

   Changes in emergency procedures that
were implemented after the Delta Flight 191 tragedy three years ago
helped make a smooth response to last week's crash, an official
said Sunday.
   ``This emergency response appears to be one of the most
effective that I've ever seen,'' said Lawrence D. Roman, a
representative of the American Association of Airport Executives
and a member of the ``survival factors'' group of the National
Transportation Safety Board team investigating Wednesday's crash.
   Delta Flight 1141 crashed and burned on takeoff at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport, killing 13. Ninety-five people,
including the three members of the cockpit crew, survived as the
Boeing 727 skidded to rest at the end of a runway.
   ``It would appear that on first impression that this response
was excellent,'' Roman said. ``I don't know of any screw-ups at all
in the whole operation.''
   He stressed that he was not speaking on behalf of the
investigation, but as a representative of the airport executives
association.
   Roman said changes made in emergency response procedures at the
airport since the Aug. 2, 1985, crash of Delta Flight 191,
including installation of cellular telephones in ambulances, helped
in evacuating survivors.
   Also, he said, an automated telephone system implemented at the
airport's Department of Public Safety office reduced the time it
took to notify rescue workers after the crash.
   Those procedures resulted from NTSB recommendations made after
the 1985 crash, which resulted in 137 deaths, Roman said.
   Meanwhile, eight crash survivors were released from hospitals
Saturday. Some recalled the crash and rescue operation, which they
said involved little panic.
   Stella Grigg, at age 80 the oldest person on the downed plane,
said she was pushed out of the aircraft through a hole near the
cockpit and caught by a group of men on the ground.
   ``I was thrust forward and back, even though I had a seat belt
on,'' she said. ``The plane tipped to the left and tipped to the
right and just skidded along.''

<TEXT>
   An ex-policeman convicted in a pension fund
scandal surrendered Sunday, 25 hours after taking the police
official who exposed the scam hostage on the 15th floor of an
office building, authorities said.
   Anthony D. Daniele, armed with an unidentified weapon, released
John Frank, vice president of the city police board, early Sunday
and gave up 10 hours later. A day before the standoff, Daniele was
sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Authorities said Daniele had two guns, one that he brought with
him and another that he got from Frank's desk. He told police that
he had used explosives to booby-trap the door to the office where
he held Frank, but police said that turned out not to be true.
   ``At about 11 a.m. this morning, he said `I'm tired, I'm coming
out,''' said police spokeswoman Linda Hancock.
   Daniele, 39, who was once a member of the Police Department's
hostage-response team, was with his attorney when he surrendered,
authorities said.
   Frank, 53, was apparently unharmed, police said.
   A hostage-response team and dozens of officers who had
surrounded the building had negotiated with Daniele, said Ms.
Hancock.
   Daniele's attorney, Donald Wolff, told radio station KMOX that
Daniele gave up after an agreement was reached not to file any
further charges against him. Before the standoff ended, police
agreed to Daniele's demand to talk to his attorney, his family and
Bill McClellan, a columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
   McClellan, who had met Daniele while covering the Police
Department, Daniele wanted to ``talk about his case and profess his
innocence.''
   ``I think he just wanted to get the word out,'' he said. ``It's
hard to put a rational motive on something that is irrational. He
said he had just been driven to the edge.''
   Daniele was taken to the Federal Corrections Institute in
Springfield, where he will undergo psychological evaluation, said
police Lt. Col. James J. Hackett.
   Frank exposed a kickback scandal that cost police and fire
pension funds an estimated $333,000.
   On Friday, Daniele was sentenced to eight years in prison and
ordered to make restitution of $200,000 for his part in the scam.
He was convicted of extortion, conspiracy and mail fraud, and could
have received 32 years in prison. He was free pending an appeal
when the incident began, authorities said.
   The scam was carried out by paying a brokerage artificially high
commissions on stock transactions that were made with pension
funds, prosecutors said. Participants in the scheme were then given
back part of the money.
   Daniele, who headed the police pension fund, was the only one of
six men indicted to stand trial. The others pleaded guilty to
lesser charges and also were sentenced Friday.
   Attorney Donald C. Anton, who was considered the mastermind of
the plan, was sentenced to nine years in prison. The others were
sentenced to prison terms ranging from six months to three years.

   About 50,000 people, some carrying candles and
saying prayers, lined up hand in hand on a Latvian shore to protest
pollution they say is killing the Baltic Sea, an area journalist
reported Sunday.
   Some protesters also collected money to help pay for the cleanup
of the sea, Robert Bambitis, editor of the Latvian state-run
television program, said by telephone from Riga, the Latvian
capital.
   He said protests also were held Saturday in the two other Baltic
republics, Lithuania and Estonia, but he gave no details.
   Worries about pollution have been a major factor fueling
nationalist resentment toward Moscow in the three Baltic republics.
   Many residents feel central authorities recklessly built
factories that pollute the environment, and they demand more
regional control over environmental and economic decisions.
   Bambitis did not say exactly where the protests took place in
Latvia.
   This summer, some of the Soviet Baltic coast's most popular
beaches, including Jurmala in Latvia, were closed to bathers
because of polluted water and refuse that washed up on shore.

   Smoke was billowing and about 150
people were evacuated both in and around Yellowstone National Park
on Sunday, but more than 200 square dancers decided the show must
go on.
   A 57,000-acre fire closing in on the park's northeastern
entrance apparently did not faze about 250 square dancers, who
gathered on the west edge of the park for the 33rd annual Knothead
Jamboree.
   ``Square dancers are tough. We can take what they dish out,''
said Betty Rae Bronson of Shelley, Idaho, who is that state's
chairwoman for this year's event. ``Or else we're Knotheads. That's
what we're called.''
   The dancers come from Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Utah and have
held their jamboree each Labor Day weekend at West Yellowstone
since 1980.
   This year's attendance ``is about half what we had last year
because of the fire,'' Ms. Bronson said.
   Nancy Johnson of Missoula, the Montana co-chairman, said
attendance at the jamboree usually numbers closer to 800.
   ``It would've been too late to move it ... or cancel unless it
would have been an emergency situation or evacuation of the town,''
she said.
   So they pressed ahead with the festival, which began Saturday
and is to conclude Monday. But the event was hurt financially by
the low attendance and may not break even this year, Johnson said.
   The never-say-die square dancers had reserved a hall in the Fly
Fishing Center, which meant that fire officials, who had set up a
fire information center there, were obliged to move their operation
into two nearby tents until the jamboree ends.
   Meanwhile, tourists continued flocking to the nation's oldest
park, despite weeks of headline-making fires.
   ``We've never been here before. We just decided we wanted to see
Yellowstone,'' said Eugene Kistner of Carmi, Ill. His wife, Esther,
said they knew what to expect because they had been following the
fires' progress on television, but decided not to let that
interfere with their plans.
   ``We wanted to try it anyway,'' she said.
   ``We got to see everything we intended to see,'' Eugene Kistner
said.

   An official is promising to close a legal
loophole that allowed the city's first bullfights to take place
over the weekend, but Hispanics argue that a ban will strip them of
their culture and heritage.
   ``We're going back to the drawing board on Tuesday,'' to figure
out how to ban bullfights, said Peter Poholik, executive director
of Chicago's Commission on Animal Care and Control.
   About 300 people viewed bloodless bullfights in a temporary
arena set up as part of a Hispanic festival Saturday.
   Four matadors confronted three 1,000-pound bulls, using the
traditional capes. But instead of being killed, the animals had
Velcro patches glued to their backs to grab onto the matadors'
Velcro-covered swords and darts.
   ``The cruelest thing they're doing is teasing the animal,''
Poholik said. ``It's not right but it's not physically harming the
animal. We've got enough of animal exploitation. We don't need
this,'' he said in a telephone interview Sunday.
   Bullfighting is not permitted in the United States, but three
states _ Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas _ have allowed the bloodless
variety, Poholik said.
   Chicago has an ordinance to prevent bullfights. But Cook County
Circuit Judge Albert Green on Friday ordered the city to grant a
permit to Jaass Productions Inc. to stage the exhibition because
the bulls are not killed.
   ``I'm going to work with the mayor and city attorneys and get an
amendment to an ordinance so we can ban bull baiting,'' the
commissioner said. ``This bloodless bullfight is just another form
of teasing and torment.''
   But Rodolfo Mancilla, an aide to state Rep. Benjamin Martinez,
who helped arrange the festival, said bullfighting is part of
Hispanic culture.
   ``They've already taken away our language in schools,'' he said.
``Now they want to take away our folklore, tradition, heritage,
culture. You just can't keep doing that and have people stand for
it.''
   Poholik, who watched Saturday's bullfight with an investigator
from his staff and state officials, said the animals were not
treated harshly.
   ``The promoters kept their word. There was no blood drawn,''
Poholik said. ``The animals were in excellent condition _ well fed.
There was a good corral area. You could tell they were well cared
for.''
   Many of the spectators were also concerned about the animals.
   ``Most of the people were rooting for the bulls,'' Poholik said.
``They cheered when the matadors got knocked down.''
   The bulls' ultimate destination is the butcher shop, said
breeder Manuel Correla. The animals ``learn quickly'' and can only
be used for one bullfight, he said. ``We use them for hamburger.''

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government passed
a key test in its bid to overhaul Japan's tax system when the
governing Liberal Democratic Party scored twin victories Sunday in
a provincial election.
   Final results Monday in conservative Fukushima province gave the
Liberal Democrats the governorship and a seat in Parliament's upper
House of Councilors.
   Officials said 81.2 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots
_ a record for Fukushima.
   Eisaku Sato won the gubernatorial race with 685,791 votes
compared to 461,350 for Toshio Hirose, a Liberal Party rebel who
opposed the tax changes, and communist candidate Masaru Kusano who
polled 61,630 votes in the northern province.
   Liberal Democrat Kentaro Ishihara won the House of Councilors
seat with 702,940 votes to 312,203 for Kazuo Ishiga of the
Socialist Party and 186,503 for Yumiko Abe of the Communist Party.
   The victories were a boost to the governing party's attempt to
reform tax laws to include a controversial 3 percent consumption
tax on nearly all goods and services.
   Takeshita has staked his political life on the success of the
tax measure. He said this year, ``I am prepared to take political
responsibility if the tax reform cannot be realized.''
   It is Japan's third attempt to overhaul a tax system drafted by
American occupation officials shortly after World War II. Previous
failures dealt embarrassing political setbacks to two of
Takeshita's predecessors.
   Opposition parties had hoped to spark nationwide resistance to
the consumption tax, making the governor's election a showdown on
the reform proposals.
   Takeshita's party had not officially endorsed either Sato or
Hirose in the gubernatorial campaign.
   ``The results have stirred high interest ... they will exert
great influence on the tax reform,'' said a statement from
Takeshita on Ishihara's victory.
   ``As the governing party we have taken the long view and
advocated the necessity of tax reform. We gained the voters'
understanding with our efforts,'' Takeshita said.
   The Japan Socialist Party blamed the governing party for its
defeat. ``The conservative Liberal Democratic Party's disunity
alone was emphasized by its skillful concealment and ambiguous
treatment of the consumption tax,'' Secretary General Tsuruo
Yamaguchi said in a statement.
   The conservative victories stymied opposition hopes of building
up momentum against the tax reform. Last year, a gubernatorial
victory by the Socialists in another conservative stronghold
prompted nationwide protests that led to the defeat of then-Premier
Yasuhiro Nakasone's tax reform proposals.
   Faced with a political opposition united against the tax plan,
however, Takeshita's government has managed to win agreement only
on initial cuts in income taxes. Parliamentary deliberation on the
rest of the package has been stalled by a stock-profit scandal
involving several politicians and aides.
   The package calls for reducing Japan's heavy reliance on direct
taxes by trimming income and corporate taxes and introducing the
consumption tax. Critics say the plan falls short of the
government's goal of easing inequities in the present system and
preventing future increases in the consumption tax rate.
   Although the Liberal Democrats hold commanding majorities in
both houses of Japan's parliament, tradition and popular resistance
have kept the party from ramming through the proposals.

<HEAD>Romania Accuses Hungarian News Media of Distortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania on Sunday accused the Hungarian
news media of distorted coverage of events in Romania even after
the leaders of the two communist countries agreed to try to improve
relations.
   A major issue that has strained relations is Romania's plan to
raze some 7,000 villages, including hundreds of communities
populated mainly by ethnic Hungarians, and resettle the people in
agro-industrial centers as part of a land reform program. There are
about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania, which has a
population of 23 million.
   An editorial in Scinteia, the newspaper of the Romanian
Communist Party, said the Hungarian media is ``becoming the echo of
hostile, chauvinistic and nationalistic circles and groups.''
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu met with Hungarian Premier
Karoly Grosz in the Romanian town of Arad a week ago in the first
top-level meeting between the two countries in eleven years.
   Scinteia said Ceausescu told Grosz the Hungarian media ``distort
in their coverage the situation in Romania, give accounts that are
not real, including the program of modernization and organization
of settlements of the country, of improvement of the Romanian
people's living standard.''
   It reported Ceausescu also said those programs ``are internal
matters, the resolution of which is the exclusive concern of our
party, of the Romanian people.''
   The editorial said: ``The Romanian people are outraged by such
gross attempts (by the Hungarian media) to falsify the Romanian
realities and denigrate the Romanian policy, and most firmly
disapproves of such practices.''
   Some Hungarian officials have called Romania's resettlement
plan, which is to be completed by the year 2000, idiotic and ``a
crime against mankind.''

   A 110-degree reading tied the city's all-time
record Sunday and the heat drove hundreds of thousands to beaches
for the Labor Day weekend, causing power outages and helping feed a
swarm of brushfires.
   To the north, Grants Pass, Ore., broke a 33-year-old record of
103 degrees with a 107-degree reading, and Spokane, Wash., baked
under a third day of record-breaking temperatures _ this time with
a little smoke added.
   The last time the temperature reached 110 in Los Angeles was
Sept. 1, 1955. The temperature easily beat the record high for the
date of 100 set in 1984.
   To the south, a record for the date of 107 was set at San
Diego's Lindbergh Field, surpassing a 1961 record of 95.
   Other triple-digit temperatures in southern California were Long
Beach, 104; Burbank, 106; Fullerton, 108; and Ontario, 110.
   Riverside and San Bernardino, usually the inland hot spots, were
cooler with 104 and 106 degrees, respectively.
   The hottest spot in California Sunday was about 300 miles
northeast of San Francisco at Red Bluff, which posted a record 118
degrees.
   Beach highways were jammed, with no parking available anywhere,
observers said. Guards at beaches near Los Angeles estimated some
775,000 people took to the sand, while lifeguards at Newport and
Huntington beaches in Orange County reported 207,000 people.
   It was so crowded ``you could probably hop from blanket to
blanket to avoid the hot sand ... play beach blanket bingo on your
way to the water,'' said Huntington State Beach lifeguard Jim Balok.
   Southern California Edison reported 1,000 customers without
electricity due to peak demand from air conditioners that knocked
out 425 transformers.
   Power outages also were reported in Watts and in Hancock Park,
home of Mayor Tom Bradley, but they were not believed caused by
demand related to the heat, said Dorothy Jensen, spokeswoman for
the city's Department of Water and Power.
   As the heat raged, so did the brush fires. Fast moving blazes
were reported in San Diego, Riverside, Orange, San Bernardino and
Ventura counties, with more than 2,800 acres charred.
   Sunday was the second day of the southern California heat wave.
The National Weather Service predicted lower temperatures for the
coast Monday, but continued high temperatures in inland areas for
Labor Day, with some relief reaching inland Tuesday.
   Other highs in Oregon Sunday included 103 at Medford, 102 at The
Dalles and 101 at Hermiston, none of which were records.
   In Washington, Spokane hit 96, four degrees higher than the
previous record for the date set in 1963, the weather service said.
It was the third day in a row that a daily record high was broken,
with Saturday's maximum of 98 equalling the all-time high
temperature for September.
   Spokane residents also had to put up with smoky skies from the
forest fires burning in the northeast part of the state.

   Electricity flowed downtown again Sunday after a
three-day blackout that halted elevators in high-rises, thawed
frozen food and shut down air conditioners during one of the
hottest weeks in Seattle history.
   Power was finally restored to much of the 50-block area Saturday
night, but Seattle City Light asked customers to conserve power and
not turn on air conditioners until two more fire-damaged cables
could be repaired.
   Three days without electricity had taken their toll.
   ``Too many problem, too many problems,'' said Dae W. Kim as he
slowly began turning on the dozen coolers in his grocery and deli.
``I've got a headache.''
   About half the blacked-out area's customers began receiving
power via four repaired feeder cables at 6:47 p.m. Saturday. By
Sunday night, 90 percent of the affected customers had power back,
but there were load restrictions on four buildings, said Jim
Aguirre, a spokesman for the city-owned utility.
   Crews still were working on restoring a fifth feeder cable, and
the sixth feeder was expected to be brought back into service
Monday or later, Aguirre said.
   Until then, many buildings will have only partial power, since
they receive electricity from a combination of the cables, said
Hugh McIntosh, another City Light spokesman.
   At the twin towers of the 875-room Westin Hotel, for example,
full service was restored to the south tower early Sunday, while
the north tower remained on a generator, rented for $6,200 a week,
marketing director Dell Schooly said.
   The six cables were destroyed Wednesday by an unexplained
underground fire.
   City Light Superintendent Randall Hardy said the fire apparently
started in the City Light cables, in which power should have been
cut off by automatic current limiters that act when a cable gets
hot.
   Electricity also continued to flow through a nearby Metro
transit cable, powering electric trolleys, and that may have made
the fire worse, he said.
   When the power restoration began, patrols roamed the area to
make sure no fires were triggered by equipment left switched on
when the outage began.
   ``It went very smoothly. I have no reports of problems other
than the sprinkler in the Battery Street tunnel,'' which apparently
began wetting down the tunnel when it was tripped by the power
surge, McIntosh said.
   ``We called the fire department and told them it was their
problem.''
   Air conditioning was lost as temperatures soared to a September
record of 98 degrees Friday and to a record for the date of 92 on
Saturday. Sunday dawned with a cool fog and a forecast high of only
80 to 85.
   City Light had no estimate of its costs to restore power or of
damage from the fire.
   ``Our field people were really extending themselves, a lot of
them volunteering to go 16 hours, double shifts, until they could
get the thing done,'' McIntosh said.
   No injuries were reported and stepped-up police patrols were
credited with preventing break-ins.
   At the height of the blackout, city officials estimated that 90
percent of all businesses in the area were closed. The area has
about 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place Market,
the large Bon Marche department store and several hotels, grocery
stores and taverns.
   Pike Place Market businesses saw a drop in traffic, even though
many shops never lost electricity.
   ``People think the whole market is closed,'' said Garth Wilson
of Jack's Fish Spot.
   The Red Cross served three meals a day to 150 to 250 elderly
residents stuck in the darkened area. Volunteers had to take some
meals up 13 flights in buildings where elevators were out of
operation.

<DATELINE>SILVER GATE, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents outside the northeastern
entrance to Yellowstone National Park were told to evacuate Sunday
as hundreds of firefighters mounted a ``last-ditch effort to save
this town,'' and a spokeswoman said the situation within the park
was deteriorating.
   ``It's going to be a siege for the next 48 hours,'' said Pat
Kaunert, a fire information officer.
   More than 50 fire engines stood by to protect homes in Silver
Gate and nearby Cooke City as the 57,000-acre fire approached from
the west. Park County disaster coordinator Bob Fry said about 150
people were being evacuated.
   ``We were threatened with evacuation two weeks ago, so I packed
then,'' Ellen Gesensway said in the doorway of her rented cabin.
``I've been packed ever since.''
   Bulldozers carved a 65-foot-wide fire line through forest just
west of here, and nearly 500 firefighters helped dig the line by
hand. Crews planned to set a ``backfire'' to cut off the main
fire's fuel source.
   ``We're creating a massive buffer in a last-ditch effort to save
this town,'' Kaunert said. ``We need two miles of buffer in front
of the fire to hold it. Two miles of black.''
   The blazes now cover some 910,000 acres of the greater
Yellowstone area, including 611,000 acres within the park itself,
or more than one-fourth of Yellowstone's 2.2 million total acreage.
   Within Yellowstone itself, firefighters Sunday tried to save
wooden foot bridges and protect a campground.
   ``This situation is growing increasingly more serious day by
day,'' said Yellowstone National Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
``It is a magnitude that no one in their wildest imagination or
scientific predictions could have suggested.''
   Anzelmo added that without help from the weather, no amount of
money spent by the National Park Service or the U.S. Forest Service
will help douse the blazes. Winds were relatively calm Sunday, but
forecasts called for variable winds up to 30 mph later in the week.
   ``Mother Nature is making the decisions here,'' said Anzelmo.
   Some U.S. Forest Service firefighters criticized the National
Park Service for allowing fires to burn uncontrolled earlier this
summer despite dry conditions. Officials said at the time that it
was their policy not to fight lightning-caused fires in the
wilderness, which they consider a natural part of forest
re-generation.
   Amy Vanderbilt, another park spokeswoman, said the firefighters
don't understand the problem.
   ``What these firefighters who are coming in (from other states)
may not realize is that firefighters were on that (North Fork) fire
within 15 minutes after it started,'' she said in a telephone
interview from park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyo.
   ``Because of the extremely dry conditions, that fire grew
amazingly fast and beyond anyone's expectations,'' she said.
   Elsewhere Sunday, Washington state's most serious forest fires
ballooned to more than 12,500 acres, sending smoke and ash over the
town of Republic but posing no immediate threat.
   In Silver Gate, a sheriff's department vehicle drove down the
street at 8 a.m., its siren blaring. Authorities knocked on doors
and phoned people, asking them to leave. Under Montana law,
officials cannot force anyone to evacuate.
   Wayne Johnson watched the firefighters march by and said he was
staying. ``There's no real reason to leave,'' he said. ``I don't
think the town's going to burn.''
   Inside the Log Cabin Cafe, the owners dashed around, preparing
to close up and get out.
   ``I'm angry,'' said co-owner Cecile King. ``We have been
battling with the Park Service since the first of July (to do
more), and now the fires are threatening every town around the
park.''
   The lightning-sparked fire threatening Silver Gate has been
burning June 14. Under Forest Service policy for naturally
occurring fires, the blaze was allowed to burn as long as it
remained within certain boundaries.
   But in mid-August, wind gusting to 70 mph blew the fire across
several miles in a matter of hours, and a human-caused fire to the
west also gained ground.
   That fire now stands at nearly 54,000 acres, and officials
expect the two blazes to merge. As of Sunday, they were two miles
apart.
   Elsewhere, in northeastern Montana, firefighters battling a
9,100-acre fire northeast of Libby ``had a pretty quiet night'' but
still had no deadline for containment, said Kootenai National
Forest spokesman Dick Guth.
   Guth said 1,600 firefighters were stymied by ``unbelievably hot,
dry conditions. It is hard to say when we'll be able to get a line
that will hold.''
   Hot, dry weather and a smoky haze that covered much of Idaho
continued to hamper efforts to contain four major fires that have
blackened more than 80,000 acres of forest and grassland. Crews and
pumper trucks were stationed around several ranches as firefighters
expected the largest of the fires to jump the boundaries of the
Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness and move onto private
property.
   In southern California, wildfires blackened nearly 3,000 acres
of brush and timber and damaged at least 21 structures as searing,
dry weather and Santa Ana winds harried firefighters and ignited
new flames.
   Temperatures neared 110 degrees throughout the region, humidity
was low, and gusty northeasterly desert winds rolled through
canyons and hills.
   In San Diego County, firefighters mopped up hot spots from a
600-acre blaze whose sparks scorched the roofs of at least 20
hilltop homes.
   Arcing power lines caused a fire about 15 miles northeast of San
Diego.
   A total of 21 homes were damaged by that blaze, which forced the
evacuation of 150 people from a mobile home park, authorities said.
   In Utah, firefighters received a break from calm winds to help
keep a raging, 4,000-acre brush fire away from more than 70 canyon
homes east of Salt Lake City, authorities said.
   Lt. Gov. Val Oveson urged residents to avoid spending Labor Day
in the mountains to reduce the risk of starting additional fires in
dry forests.

   Lech Walesa on Sunday defended his
decision to end the strongest wave of strikes since Solidarity was
crushed in 1981 and said it was the only chance to legalize the
independent union movement.
   ``To those who criticize me: Stop it,'' the Solidarity chairman
told 4,000 supporters in the courtyard of St. Brygida's church
after an emotional pro-Solidarity Mass.
   ``Such (decisions) are demanded by higher necessity,'' Walesa
said. ``They (authorities) spat on me and now I am extending my
hand because there is a chance to make Poland into Poland.''
   The strikes, which began Aug. 16, ended Saturday after Walesa
urged workers to end their occupation strikes and the government
promised ``roundtable'' talks on legalizing the Soviet bloc's first
independent union.

   Floods have inundated three-quarters of
this impoverished nation, stranding at least 20 million people who
are eating raw food and drinking muddy, probably contaminated
water, officials said Sunday.
   At least 882 people have died since June, when rivers began
overflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this country
of 110 million people, according to newspapers in Dhaka. The
government count of 333 dead is widely considered low.
   ``It is a calamity,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told
reporters Sunday night. ``It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.''
   Flying in an airplane across Bangladesh Sunday from the Indian
border to Dhaka, it was virtually impossible to discern the mighty
rivers that normally ribbon this nation's landscape _ just vast
seas of muddy brown water.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis make
campaign-launching Labor Day appearances Monday in a race for the
presidency that has ignored the ceremonial starting point and is
already a close and caustic contest.
   ``It kicked off earlier than any presidential campaign I've ever
seen,'' said Frank Greer, a consultant to Democratic candidates.
``The intensity this early is really astounding.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic nominee who has seen a huge midsummer's
lead evaporate, campaigns through the industrial Northeast and
Midwest hungering for the elusive intangibles of momentum and
initiative that he once commanded.
   Bush, the vice president and Republican nominee, enters the
final nine weeks of his race for the White House appearing in
control of their long-distance debate, at least for now, and
enjoying a resurrection in the polls. He was campaigning on the
West Coast.

   The most negative political advertising
campaign ever is likely this fall from two presidential candidates
who are close in the polls, close on the issues and far from shy
about going on the offensive.
   Students of political advertising say media drives by the George
Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigns are likely to begin on an upbeat
note.
   But viewers shouldn't expect sunshine and roses on the air.
Critical ads ranging from mild comparisons to outright blasts are
planned by independent groups and the two parties, and the
candidates are expected to follow suit later in the season.
   Ultimately, the race will be ``the most negative in the history
of TV,'' predicted Kathleen Jamieson, a University of Texas
professor and author of two books on political communications.
   Democrat Dukakis and Republican Bush both scheduled traditional
Labor Day week media assaults, with at least one of them employing
a soft sell as the campaign season formally begins.

   Florida Republicans, with a good shot at gaining a
U.S. Senate seat two years after losing one, choose Tuesday between
the arch-conservative grandson of a baseball legend and the brash
prosecutor who put a Colombian drug lord behind bars.
   Six Democrats are battling in their primary, prompted by the
decision of the popular incumbent, Lawton Chiles, not to seek
re-election. An October runoff will be necessary if, as expected,
no one gets more than half the votes.
   Seven of Florida' 19 congressional districts are also holding

   Raising funds has been the dominant topic of the Senate races,
two years after then-Gov. Bob Graham unseated Republican Sen. Paula
Hawkins in a race that cost them a combined $13 million.

   Gang violence rages on in the City of Angels
and street thugs are expanding their drug trade to other U.S.
cities despite police sweeps, a new FBI task force and two ``gang
summits.''
   More than 200 people have died in gang-related slayings so far
this year; 11 people were slain last weekend, and an undercover
policeman was shot to death Saturday while tailing suspects in a
drive-by shooting.
   Los Angeles County had a record 387 gang-related slayings in
1987, and authorities are expecting more than 420 in 1988, said
Deputy District Attorney Michael Genelin, head of the district
attorney's Hardcore Gang Unit.
   Drive-by gang killings now average more than one a day and often
claim innocent bystanders.
   Community outcry prompted Los Angeles police to launch a
full-scale assault in March. Twice since then, they have marched
1,000 officers into the most gang-infested areas on weekends.
   The result has been a decline in the overall crime rate,
although the gang murder rate continues to climb.

   Federal investigators wound up their
field work at the site of last week's Delta air crash Sunday,
refusing to comment on speculation that double engine failure might
have led to the disaster.
   The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous sources close to the
investigation, reported Sunday that investigators are trying to
determine whether two of the three engines on the Boeing 727 failed
in the seconds before Wednesday's crash.
   ``When someone says engine failure there are a whole host of
things that might mean,'' Lee Dickinson, a member of the NTSB, said
at a briefing Sunday. ``One of the things I will not do is
speculate on anything.''
   Some pilots said the fact that the wing flaps on the jet were
apparently retracted at the time of the crash, when they ordinarily
would have been extended for takeoff, may have been a sign the
pilots were trying to fly the plane on one engine, not a cause of
the crash, newspapers reported.

   The trial of Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-law, accused
of taking $1.1 million in bribes, is expected to lay bare the
widespread corruption of the Brezhnev era.
   Court begins Monday for Yuri Churbanov, a former first deputy
interior minister who once moved in the top levels of Kremlin
society. If found guilty of bribe-taking and abuse of office, he
and eight co-defendants could be executed by firing squad.
   Their trial, and the extraordinary publicity given its
investigatory phase, are in line with Communist Party chief Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's drive to break with the cronyism, corruption and
nepotism now seen as endemic under Brezhnev. Brezhnev ruled the
Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982.
   The court case, to be heard by the Military Collegium of the
Soviet Supreme Court, may also have a political aim _ to signal the
Kremlin Old Guard who flourished under Brezhnev that their time has
passed and that continued resistance to Gorbachev-era reforms must
cease.

spectators as Europe's top aviation event opened under the shadow
of last week's West German air show disaster.
   Soon after a Soviet MiG-29 fighter thrilled the crowd at the
Farnborough Air Show with precision maneuvers, a blue-and-white
Antonov-124, the world's heaviest aircraft, began its takeoff.
   About 10,000 spectators stood by as a 20-foot sheet of flame
shot out of the No. 2 engine.
   A pilot cut the other engines and halted the nearly 450-ton
aircraft of the Soviet Aeroflot state airline. No one was injured.

scanned the target and flung the plane in a stomach-wrenching
attack dive into the rocky valley below.
   The small U.S. Air Force OV-10 Bronco nose-dived, the force of
the acceleration forcing its two occupants back against their
armor-plated seats. Hills flashed past as Vandervalk streaked
toward the target, calmly checking the attack coordinates.
   White phosphorous rockets flashed from the plane's belly and
slammed into the practice target as the pilot jerked the plane up
over a rock cliff. Vandervalk glanced back to check his handiwork.

guarantee the security of the Olympics.

   When three Irish Republican Army members were
gunned down in Gibraltar on March 6 while allegedly plotting a car
bombing, the British government claimed a victory on the
battlefield of terrorism.
   Instead it got a political controversy that is still simmering
six months later. A long-awaited inquest into the killings opens
Tuesday in the British colony on the southeast tip of Spain.
   Mairead Farrell, Daniel MacCann and Sean Savage were unarmed
when they died. The car bomb, much to the British government's
embarrassment, never materialized, although the IRA admitted the
three were on a guerrilla mission and a car full of explosives was
found 40 miles from the scene two days later.
   Moreover, two British television networks investigating what had
happened that sunny Sunday in Gibraltar found witnesses whose
accounts strongly suggested the three were shot without being given
any chance to surrender.

   U.S. aid has helped prevent the takeover of El
Salvador by leftist guerrillas but has failed to solve the
underlying social problems that sparked the insurgency, say four
U.S. Army lieutenant colonels who have served in the Central
American nation and in Vietnam.
   ``The American foundation for conducting small wars is
defective,'' said the report, prepared while the four officers were
on fellowships at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.
   The unsatisfactory results of the U.S. effort in El Salvador,
which the authors described as neither victory nor defeat, stem in
part from local conditions and in part from the failure of the
Reagan administration to clearly define its goals, they said.

   There's a new multimillionaire
somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers
needed to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least
$54 million, officials said Sunday.
   The winning $1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchased
in Longwood, a town of 14,500 in central Florida, Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winner
steps forward.
   Eight-digit riches were also doled out in New York, where one
winning ticket was purchased for a $23 million jackpot Saturday
night, and in Illinois, where holders of four winning tickets will
split a $21 million prize.
   The previous national record jackpot, $51.4 million, was shared
by two California lottery players in June. A Pennsylvania couple
had the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won
$46 million in 1987.

<HEAD>Analysts' Interest Rate Worries Get Specific</HEAD>

   As any casual follower of the stock market
knows, a lot of the market's recent woes have been blamed on rising
interest rates.
   But it is the way rates have been rising, even more than the
simple fact that they have been moving up, that particularly
troubles some analysts.
   With several nudges from the Federal Reserve, short-term
interest rates (on debt securities with lives of a year or less)
have climbed more sharply of late than long-term rates (on bonds
with maturities of up to 30 years).
   That means that what Wall Streeters call the yield curve, a
graphic representation of the relationship between short- and
long-term rates, is flattening.
   If it inverts _ that is, if short-term rates go higher than
long-term rates _ many analysts believe it would be a sign of
significant trouble for both the stock market and the economy.
   Normally, interest rates on long-term debt tend to be higher
than on short-term loans because long-term borrowers expose
themselves to greater risk that the purchasing power of their money
will be eroded by inflation, or that the issuer of the debt will
default.
   So when the yield curve tilts in the opposite direction, it is
widely taken as a sign that something is out of whack.
   Inverted yield curves showed up early in the bear markets and
recessions that occurred in 1973-74 and again at the beginning of
the 1980s.
   ``If the yield curve inverts, there is a very high probability
that a recession will follow,'' said Susan Berge Kent, an analyst
at Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., in a recent commentary.
   Recently, she noted, the ratio of rates on three-month Treasury
bills to those on 30-year Treasury bonds stood at .78.
   ``If the ratio rises above .80 and the Fed does not cut the
discount rate, historical probability indicates that the yield
curve will invert,'' she said.
   Another cause for concern, in the view of Anthony Sorrentino,
technical analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp., is the fact that
rates on three-month T-bills, at more than 7 percent, are higher
than the Fed's discount rate, which it recently raised from 6
percent to 6.5 percent.
   ``Such a positive spread is a sign of a restrictive Federal
Reserve policy, which usually places downward pressure on the stock
market,'' Sorrentino said.
   ``Until the T-bill rate falls below the discount rate, this
measure will remain in a bearish mode.''
   Analysts at the financial advisory service Donoghue's
Moneyletter say managers of money market mutual funds have also
been sounding a warning about interest rates and the financial
outlook in recent months.
   As a group, these managers have been shortening the average
maturities of the securities in their portfolios.
   The standard motive for shortening maturities is to avoid or
minimize price declines for existing securities when interest rates
rise, and to have money available soon to invest at higher rates.
   ``When these managers believe interest rates are poised for a
rise, they invest their funds in shorter-term securities,'' the
newsletter said.
   ``Since the shortening began, the stock market generally has
been moving sideways, and it recently has declined in the face of
higher interest rates.''

   When he was just barely a teen-ager, Gary
E. Hoover decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book of
retailing.
   By 1982, armed with an economics degree and experience as a Wall
Street analyst and department store executive, he was ready to
start writing.
   Hoover, then 31, opened his first Bookstop store in the Texas
capital, modeling it loosely on the successful Toys R Us design _
big selection and discount prices. A book ``superstore,'' he called
it.
   Six years later, the Bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores _
with three more scheduled to open by year's end _ in Texas, Florida
and Louisiana. And the Bookstop founder and chairman says
confidently that there will be more to the story.
   ``I decided when I was, like 13 years old, that someday I was
going to start a chain of stores. Everything I've done since then
was toward that goal,'' he said.
   But if your idea of a bookstore is a small, musty, dark-paneled
place awash in pipe smoke, Bookstop stores might come as a shock.
   The company says its average store covers 9,500 square feet and
stocks 35,000 titles in 300 subject areas.
   Hoover is an architecture buff, and the stores have moved into
some unusual sites, including Houston's art-deco Alabama movie
theater. The store being opened in New Orleans will be located in a
100-year-old cotton warehouse.
   ``We've got the flexibility to do those things _ old cafeterias,
old roller-skating rinks, old theaters,'' he said. ``I'd love to be
in an old bank, too.''
   Bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more, some closing only two
days a year. They offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles, 25
percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers who
annually purchase ``Readers Choice'' cards. The company counts more
than 200,000 cardholders.
   Bookstop has centralized distribution, so books arriving at the
Austin headquarters from publishers can be inventoried, labeled
with the chain's own price tags and shipped to stores. The stores
transmit their sales results nightly by computer, making them
available the next morning so Bookstop's four buyers can see what's
selling.
   ``With a superstore like ours, to break even, our annual sales
volume's got to be three, four times the sales of the average
bookstore. It's a much harder thing to do, to carry that big a
selection. We need an advanced computer system, real sophisticated
inventory control systems, and yet we try to do it all at a
discount,'' Hoover said, adding that Bookstop moved 4.5 million
volumes through its distribution center last year.
   ``Retailing's always been an intensely competitive business. But
it's becoming a much more technological business. Our survival
depends much more on research, on understanding the customer, on
computerized controls,'' he said.
   The privately held company doesn't make public sales figures,
although Hoover has said in the past that 1986 sales were $26
million. In 1985, the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days.
   The company's founder got his start with an economics degree
from the University of Chicago. He was a retailing analyst with
Citibank in New York and worked for department store companies in
Dallas and St. Louis. He says he spent seven years working on his
Bookstop business plan before raising the money to open the first
store.
   Hoover readily credits the Toys R Us stores with the concept. He
voices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be among
retailing's big winners between now and the end of the century. He
cites such companies as Drug Emporium Inc., Sound Warehouse, and
new superstores in office supplies and sporting goods.
   ``Books is one of the fastest-growing categories of retailing
... That demand ties to the baby boom, because baby boomers are
getting richer every day, their incomes are rising as a group, and
they're really oriented toward buying books, continuing
self-education, and now buying their children books,'' Hoover said.
   Although other bookstore chains already were major national
forces, Hoover said he didn't encounter too much skepticism when he
approached investors with his idea of another.
   ``Books have survived the introduction of radio, the
introduction of television, the introduction of phonograph records
and movies. Books are a way of transmitting information, and
compared with other ways of transmitting information, they are
still cheap, portable, compact and readily available. We're trying
to do our part to make them more readily available,'' he said.

Television</HEAD>

   All business _ that's how Carl Westcott came to be
one of the latest success stories in the television industry.
   The 48-year-old Westcott, founder and chairman of Dallas-based
Westcott Communications, has jumped to the forefront of the
business television industry with his Automotive Satellite
Television Network.
   ASTN, billed as the world's largest private satellite television
network, delivers about 30 hours of auto industry news and training
programs to about 3,600 subscriber automobile dealerships across
the United States and Canada.
   The fledgling network has been a rapid success: some 18 percent
of the nation's car dealerships pay about $385 a month to receive
ASTN programming. Westcott's goal is to have his programming aired
to 50 percent of the industry.
   ``It does take people by surprise,'' Westcott said of his
creation's success. ``They've been shocked.''
   Industry experts say private television networks devoted to a
particular business are a tremendous growth industry and the market
could generate billions of dollars in business within 10 years,
Westcott said.
   Westcott already is looking ahead. He just moved his company
into a new $6 million headquarters with three studios and
production facilities where more than 600 thirty-minute programs
will be created and produced this year.
   Westcott Communications plans soon to create private television
programming for the banking, hotel and travel industries. Westcott
said he also has contacted the Internal Revenue Service with a
proposal to create training programming for its employees.
   Westcott _ who owns auto dealerships in Atlanta, Ga., Huntington
Beach, Calif., and Tyler, Texas _ formed his private television
network after buying an NBC affiliate in Tyler and discovering at a
network meeting in New York how inexpensive it was to buy satellite
time.
   He decided that a private television network might be the
perfect vehicle to provide top-quality training materials for the
automobile dealerships he owned. He had found that existing films
and other materials were not effectively training his employees.
   ``We didn't invent anything,'' Westcott said. ``But we just
rolled it over into what it is now. We realize that people grow up
watching 30 to 40 hours of television a week. And most people
receive more information daily from television than any other
source.''
   The private network also allows businessmen to get important
industry news as soon as possible, instead of having to wait for
newsletters that might not arrive until 10 days or more after an
important event.
   ``The news is what the dealer is most interested in,'' Westcott
said.
   With a Detroit news bureau and reporters in Los Angeles and
Washington, D.C., ASTN delivers news about plant closings, strikes,
new financing rates and other items of interest to the automotive
industry. Newscasts are made every 90 minutes.
   Westcott said many dealerships plan their sales meetings to
include ASTN programming, and that an ASTN broadcast may be watched
by as many as 20,000 people.

<HEAD>Furr's CEO Looking to Become Cafeteria King</HEAD>

   To Michael Levenson, the cafeteria is an
all-American standby that occupies a perfect, sturdy niche in the
often volatile restaurant industry.
   ``It's not a juicier hamburger, it's not a faster pizza. It's
not a fad,'' said Levenson, chairman and chief executive officer of
Furr's-Bishop's Cafeterias Inc. ``And it's a reliable stream of
cash flow.''
   The cash-rich, low-debt balance sheets of the cafeteria segment
drew Levenson to acquire Furr's-Bishop's and has made Dallas-based
Wyatt Cafeterias Inc. his acquisition target for the past two years.
   Levenson said Thursday he would not give his takeover attempts,
but refused to specify his plans if his latest overture is rejected.
   The closely-held Wyatt has revenues of about $190 million and
120 restaurants nationwide.
   After first offering to buy the company in May 1986, Levenson
made several bids for Wyatt. Last Wednesday, he sweetened his offer
for Wyatt to $188.1 million in cash and securities from an earlier
$179.3 million bid.
   The latest $91.25 per-share bid came after Wyatt rejected
Levenson's $87 per-share cash offer in favor of one from a Wyatt
management-based employee stock ownership plan that bid $84 per
share.
   Wyatt shareholders are scheduled to vote on the ESOP offer Sept.
6, and Wyatt management has not yet responded to the latest
Furr's-Bishop's offer, Levenson said.
   ``If we don't get the Wyatt's deal that doesn't mean we're out
of the business of buying cafeterias,'' said Levenson, who owns a
small stake in Wyatt. ``We're going to grow this company.''
   The cafeteria business captured the 38-year-old Levenson's
attention after he bid unsuccessfully on companies such as
Midland-based Texas American Energy, Aloha Airlines of Hawaii and
Tesoro Petroleum Corp. of San Antonio.
   ``When I began studying the restaurant industry, the cafeteria
segment of the restaurant industry stood out with some real unique
features,'' he said.
   Convinced he had discovered a gold mine, in 1987 he acquired
Furr's Cafeterias and Bishop Buffets, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
from K mart Corp for $237.5 million.
   He converted Furr's-Bishop's into a limited partnership, got it
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold 11 million
partnership units at $10 apiece. The partnership has promised to
pay a cash distribution of $1.30 a share this year.
   Furr's-Bishops is the nation's second largest operator of
cafeterias in the nation, with 126 operating under the Furr's name
in 10 states and 26 under the Bishop's name in seven states.
   He never earned a college degree, but Levenson became the
president of a family-owned bank in Carlsbad, N.M., before being
lured away by the burgeoning oil and gas industry.
   ``Just being able to walk along and pick up the crumbs the
Exxons of the world dropped and left would make you rich beyond
your wildest dreams,'' he said.
   After buying and selling oil and gas leases during the late
1970s, his attention was drawn to the takeover attempts within the
oil and gas industry by fellow West Texan T. Boone Pickens Jr. of
Amarillo.
   Levenson said his unsuccessful takeover runs at companies helped
establish his credibility in the New York financial community,
enabling him to consummate the deal for Furr's-Bishop's.
   For the second quarter this year, the cafeteria company posted
revenue of $70.9 million, a more than 6 percent increase over the
same quarter of 1987. Furr's-Bishop's had earnings of $2 million,
or 12 cents per share, the partnership's first quarter in the black.
   Levenson predicts the company's revenue will total $273 million
this year and that will post a profit.
   He is confident he's in the right business, and cites the
cafeteria business's lack of foriegn competition and relative
isolation from costly high-tech development.
   ``Cafeteria companies have survived the Great Depression, they
survived World War II, they survived the oil crunch and every boom
and bust in the agriculture market,'' he said.
