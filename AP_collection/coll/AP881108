   George Bush crafted a watered-down version of the
Reagan revolution Tuesday, drawing independents and a sixth of the
nation's Democrats to his cause and capitalizing on prosperity as a
campaign theme, exit polls said.
   Bush's experience weighed in his favor, the polls said, and his
candidacy appeared to be boosted by affection for his boss,
President Reagan.
   But Bush was nowhere near re-creating the 18-point Reagan
landslide of 1984. The polls said a majority of women voted for
Michael Dukakis, as did just more than half of the Democrats who
voted for Reagan last time.
   Overall, though, Bush was winning about 17 percent of the
Democratic voters _ down from Reagan's 24 percent in 1984, but still
a sizable share, ABC News polling found. Dukakis, by contrast, drew
8 percent of Republicans.
   As pre-election polls anticipated, Bush led with several of the
groups that went with Reagan in 1980 and 1984. Bush was leading
among independents by 54-44 percent in ABC's exit polls, and a CBS
News-New York Times survey said Bush narrowly won Catholics, once a
strongly Democratic group.
   Bush mirrored Reagan down to the gender gap, running strongly
among men but less well among women, the polls found. ABC found Bush
leading with men, 56-43 percent, but Dukakis narrowly ahead among
women, 51-48 percent.
   Dukakis won support from some reliably Democratic groups _ nine
in 10 blacks, two-thirds of Hispanics and nearly six in 10 members
of union households. He also narrowly won 18- to 24-year-olds in NBC
News-Wall Street Journal polling, a group in which Bush had been
strong.
   Bush did not appear to be seriously hamstrung by his selection of
Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate. While 16 percent in
the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll said they may have voted for Bush
if he had not picked Quayle, almost all of them were Democrats.
   NBC News pollster Sheldon Gawiser said his conclusion was that
Quayle had little effect on the voting: ``Did it make a point
difference? Yeah, maybe.''
   Economic well-being was a key factor. In NBC-Wall Street Journal
polling, voters split evenly over whether they benefited from
Reagan's economic policies the past eight years. Of those doing
better, 84 percent backed Bush; of those doing worse, 80 percent
backed Dukakis.
   But Bush held a solid edge, 54-46 percent, among the 12 percent
of voters who were not sure whether Reagan's policies had helped
them.
   ``This is very much an economic election. People are in fact
voting their pocketbooks,'' said Gawiser. ``People who have
benefited are much more likely to vote for Bush.''
   ABC News polls found a similar result: Among those who said they
were better off than eight years ago, Bush won, 78-21. Those who
were worse off went for Dukakis, 87-12.
   More than half of the voters polled approved of Reagan's
performance as president _ 53 percent in the NBC-Wall Street Journal
poll _ and 86 percent of them backed Bush. The 38 percent who
disapproved of Reagan's work went for Dukakis in similar numbers;
the 9 percent who were unsure supported Dukakis.
   Even with Reagan's approval rating, voters by 50-44 percent said
in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll they wanted the country to
change rather than continue its course. While 82 percent who favored
change supported Dukakis, Bush got the rest of them, as well as 91
percent of those who opposed change.
   Those who counted experience as the most important factor in
their choice backed Bush by an overwhelming 94-6 percent in ABC News
polling. He also was highly rated for being trustworthy in a crisis
and as a strong leader.
   The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, similarly, found the greatest
share of Bush's backers _ 29 percent _ saying they based their
choice on the candidates' competence and experience. Another 24
percent cited national security and defense policies; 17 percent
named economic policies.
   Forty percent of Dukakis' supporters, meanwhile, said they based
their choice on domestic issues such as education and health; an
additional 15 percent cited economic policies. In ABC's poll,
Dukakis was the choice of voters looking for someone who cared about
people and offered a vision for the future. He also won for good
judgment, by 56-43 percent.
   There was some negative voting, as well: Thirteen percent of the
voters who backed Bush, and 19 percent of those who favored Dukakis,
said they made their choice primarily out of dislike for the other
candidate.
   Asked to single out one issue where they most liked their
candidate's stand, 17 percent of the voters in ABC's polls said the
economy, and they picked Bush, 57-43. Sixteen percent said national
defense, and they were for Bush, 88-11. Eleven percent said taxes,
and they were for Bush, 73-26.
   Eleven percent were most taken with their candidate's stand on
the problems of the poor, and they were in the Dukakis camp, 91-8.
The Democrat also was favored, 82-18, by the 10 percent most
impressed with health care stands.
   The ABC results were based on an initial 7,000 interviews with
voters across the country, of more than 10,000 planned. The margin
of error was plus or minus three percentage points. The CBS-Times
results were based on more than 11,000 interviews; that poll had a
two-point margin of error.
   The NBC-Wall Street Journal results were based on about 11,000
interviews and had a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.

   George Bush is likely to begin his presidency with
a blaze of summitry on everything from the nation's staggering
budget deficit to NATO's foreign policy priorities and arms
reductions with Moscow.
   Bush, whose political inclinations have bobbed across the
spectrum, promises to bring to the White House a less ideological
brand of leadership than President Reagan.
   He likely will be more of a hands-on manager than Reagan, more
involved in the day-to-day operation of government but not as deeply
absorbed in the mechanics as Jimmy Carter was.
   At the same time, Bush is known as a delegator of authority, a
student of the problems of governance who believes that the best way
to chart goals and get things done is to put the right people in the
right places.
   ``I suspect that George Bush will want a staff that includes sort
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around
him,'' said David Keene, a Republican political consultant who once
worked for Bush.
   James A. Baker III, the former Treasury secretary who was Bush's
campaign chairman, is expected to wind up as secretary of State.
Former Sen. John Tower of Texas has been lobbying hard to be
secretary of Defense.
   Bush is expected to keep Nicholas Brady as Treasury secretary,
Dick Thornburgh as attorney general, Lauro Cavazos as education
secretary and Ann McLaughlin as Labor secretary or in another
Cabinet post.
   However, Bush's surprise selection of Dan Quayle as his running
mate demonstrates that he might not follow the conventional wisdom
in staffing his administration.
   After a news conference here on Wednesday, Bush will return to
Washington for a victory rally and then drop out of sight Thursday
for a four-day Florida vacation.
   He will return to Washington on Monday for a meeting at mid-week
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Last June, Reagan had
invited Mrs. Thatcher to the White House for a farewell meeting with
himself and a get-together with the new president-elect, regardless
of who won.
   Bush also will meet next week with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   Mrs. Thatcher would like to see a NATO foreign ministers' meeting
that is scheduled to be held in June in London upgraded to a full
NATO summit conference to develop strategy for dealing with the
Kremlin.
   Bush already has proposed a NATO summit meeting, so it's likely
they'll be talking on the same wave length.
   A NATO meeting could pave the way for Bush to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Bush said recently he would like to
meet the Soviet leader at ``the earliest time'' so they can size
each other up and determine how to move ahead with strategic and
conventional arms talks.
   Among the first major problems facing Bush are the budget deficit
and the national debt. Interest payments alone on the debt will hit
$160 billion in the fiscal year 1989.
   To stem the red ink, Bush has promised to personally lead
negotiations with Congress on deficit-reduction.
   That likely will provide some fireworks since the Democrats in
Congress are unlikely to give Bush the same silk-glove treatment
that Reagan received eight years ago, when the GOP captured the
Senate.
   ``After the election, you have to sit down and make peace with
the Congress,'' said Thomas Griscom, former White House chief of
communications under Reagan.
   There also have been suggestions that Bush should meet with
defeated candidate Michael Dukakis to try to repair the wounds of a
nasty campaign.
   Along with the other summits, Bush has proposed a global
conference on the environment and a hemispheric meeting on the drug
problems. Moreover, he says he will meet with all the nation's
governors to talk about educational standards. He has not indicated
that he has any bold initiatives or solutions for any of the
problems.

<HEAD>Bentsen Claims Victory In Senate Race, Praises Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with Bentsen remarks; EDITS to tighten.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen declared victory Tuesday night
for re-election to the Senate and, on his unsuccessful campaign for
the White House, praised Michael Dukakis for running a campaign
based on ``faith in the truth.''
   ``He and I waged a campaign that's worthy of the American
people,'' the Democratic vice presidential candidate said of the
Massachusetts governor.
   ``We told you the truth and we stepped up to those issues,'' he
said, his voice cracking from fatigue as he addressed supporters in
Austin's Driskill hotel. ``We challenged America to do better.
   ``We fought fair, and we never quit. And we never lost our faith
in the truth _ that's what you need in a campaign.''
   Bentsen said he had never seen a candidate work any harder or
deliver a message any stronger than Dukakis did as the campaign drew
to a close.
   ``And he made me proud to be his partner,'' Bentsen said. ``He
made me proud to be his running mate and he made me proud to be an
American.''
   Bentsen did not directly concede defeat in the national campaign,
for which he was unable to deliver Texas to the Democratic column.
He left that task to Dukakis.
   He claimed victory in his Senate race, which he won handily over
Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas.
   Jack DeVore, Bentsen's long-time Senate spokesman, said the
election results were bittersweet.
   ``On the one hand, there's gratitude to the people of Texas,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, there's not.''
   Bentsen, in network interviews early in the evening, said Dukakis
had been badly hurt by the Republicans' negative advertising.
Bentsen said he had been left ``pretty much unscathed'' by the
negative advertising aimed at the top of the Democratic ticket.
   `They did a job on Michael Dukakis with the negative ads,''
Bentsen said in an interview on ABC-TV. ``And they distorted his
record, did so to a remarkable degree. And that was difficult to
overcome.
   ``I wasn't worked over like that. They didn't do that type of
thing to me, character assassination. ... Overall, I've been pretty
much unscathed.''
   Bentsen, like Lyndon Johnson 28 years before him, waited in the
capital of Texas for the election returns on whether he and the
governor of Massachusetts would make it to the White House.
   Bentsen spent most of Election Day in his hotel suite, visiting
with family and campaign workers and making telephone calls to his
state organization.
   At a brief photo session in the afternoon, he appeared upbeat,
encouraged, he said, by a large voter turnout in Texas.
   He was asked by reporters to compare this year's campaign with
the 1960 race.
   ``I think the mood is there, coming from behind. But we're coming
more from behind than they did then, and they just barely won,'' he
said. ``I think our campaign caught on pretty late. And the question
was always did we have enough time.''
   Bentsen said he had spoken with Dukakis on the telephone. Asked
the substance of the conversation, he quipped: ``Well, it wasn't
about Cabinet appointments.''
   The 67-year-old Texas senator was nursing a head cold, and he
canceled plans to visit a campaign phone bank during the day. He had
voted earlier by absentee ballot.
   Like LBJ, Bentsen was also on the ballot for re-election to his
Senate seat. Under Texas law, he could run for both offices, but he
promised to resign from the Senate if he won the vice presidency _
as Johnson did after John F. Kennedy won the presidential race in
1960.
   Polls released just prior to Election Day indicated the Democrats
trailed Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle in Texas. Dukakis
picked Bentsen in hopes the Texan could help deliver the state's 29
electoral votes.
   Bentsen seemed secure in seeking a fourth term in the Senate,
however, as almost every poll showed him up by 20 or more points
over Boulter.
   Bentsen finished his vice presidential campaign when he arrived
back in Texas after 2 a.m. Tuesday from a marathon day in which he
visited eight cities, five in Texas and one each in Arkansas,
Louisiana and Missouri.
   Bentsen, who was chosen by Dukakis on July 12 and nominated by
the Democratic Convention the following week, campaigned in 33
states and Washington, D.C., with about a third of his campaign time
spent in Texas. He traveled more than 107,000 miles, said Mike
McCurry, his spokesman.

<HEAD>Khomeini Approves Free Social Expression If Not Extreme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in a move
that surprised many people in Iran and neighboring countries, has
declared that free social expression is the best way to settle
disputes.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday that
Khomeini said ``academic argument should ... be encouraged rather
than suppressed in the interest of dogmatic interpretation and
authoritarian outlooks.''
   But it said that in an open letter published in the Jomhuri
Islami newspaper, Iran's revolutionary patriarch also advised
advocates of differing opinions ``not to go to extremes or try to
defame the other side.''
   Jomhuri Islami is usually the mouthpiece for hardline Islamic
revolutionary factions.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said Khomeini's letter was a
reply to a prominent Moslem cleric, Hojatoleslam Ansari, who asked
for his ``conclusive judgment'' on the divergent ideological
orientations among Iran's leaders.
   That referred to the differences between pragmatic leaders such
as Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and hardliners led by Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi and Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   The differences have centered mainly on economic matters, but
intensified after the Khomeini-dominated government accepted a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in July in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Khomeini generally had sided with the hardline elements that
support a centralized economy, an isolationist foreign policy and
absolute adherence to the Koran, the Islamic holy book. They also
opposed the cease-fire, which took effect Aug. 20.
   But Iran's economy has been devastated by the war and its
isolation from the West, and Rafsanjani's group appears to have
gained strength.
   Mousavi attempted to resign in July, citing differences within
the regime, but Khomeini publicly rebuked him, telling him to stop
complaining and stay at his post.
   Rafsanjani has encourged more links with the West and in
September Iran began negotiations aimed at restoring full diplomatic
ties with Britain.
   Hardliners objected to the move and Iran's decision to continue
the talks was considered a victory for Rafsanjani's faction.
   Iran has been under tight control and a strict Islamic code since
the revolution organized by Khomeini ousted the Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in 1979.
   A major issue now is if the government should maintain its firm
grip on the economy and foreign trade or adopt more open policies
toward trade with the West and Western participation in post-war
reconstruction.
   Sources inside Iran have reported a relaxation of the strict
social code based on Islamic tenets. Under those religious
principles, women who do not wear head-to-foot robes can be jailed
or fined and Moslems convicted of drinking liquor can be publicly
flogged.
   The sources said those rules remain in effect, but are not being
as rigidly enforced as they were up to a few months ago.

   Democrats appear assured of keeping or
improving their 54-46 grip on the Senate in today's balloting as a
handfull of cliff-hanger contests inject political drama into an
election in which most incumbents probably are home free.
   If Republicans fail to recapture the Senate majority they lost
two years ago _ as most polls suggest, a united Democratic front
will be in place on Capitol Hill next year to either challenge
George Bush or cheer on Michael Dukakis.
   But officials of both parties report unusual voter volatility in
this year's 33 Senate races, a factor that could lead to some
surprises.
   Democrats appeared poised to capture Republican-held seats in
Nebraska and Virginia.
   Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb., who was appointed to the job, trailed
Robert Kerrey, a popular former Democratic governor, in late
polling. Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, son-in-law of the late
president Lyndon B. Johnson, was the odds-on favorite for the seat
of Republican Sen. Paul Trible, who is retiring.
   The brightest Republican hope for capturing a Democratic seat
appeared to be in Mississippi. Rep. Trent Lott, the assistant GOP
leader in the House, appeared to have succeeded in his bid to
replace Sen. John Stennis, the Senate's most senior Democrat, who is
retiring.
   The open Republican seat in Vermont appeared in no danger. Rep.
James Jeffords was the clear favorite to succeed GOP Sen. Robert
Stafford who is retiring.
   But three other open Senate seats were the scenes of some of the
hottest contests.
   They included:
   _Florida, where Reps. Connie Mack III, the Republican grandson of
the baseball Hall of Fame manager of the same name, battled Rep.
Buddy MacKay for the seat of retiring Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.
   _Washington, where former Republican Sen. Slade Gorton staged a
comeback try against Rep. Mike Lowry, a liberal Democrat.
   _Wisconsin, where millionare businessman and political newcomer
Herb Kohl held an edge in polls over state Senate minority leader
Susan Engeleiter, one of the few women among 1988 Senate candidates.
The race was marked by Kohl outspending Engeleiter with millions of
dollars of his own money.
   Two Republican incumbents were battling strong attempts to oust
them from their seats.
   Sen. Chic Hecht in Nevada, a first termer, has been struggling
all year against popular Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan. And
three-term maverick Lowell Weicker in Connecticut, who first came to
national attention as a member of the Senate Watergate committee,
was strongly challenged by Democratic state Attorney General Joseph
Lieberman.
   One Democratic incumbent, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey,
struggled to fight off Republican Pete Dawkins, a resume candidate
who has been a Rhodes scholar, football star and one-star Army
general.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., appeared likely to survive a strong
challenge by Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy. Wilson led McCarthy
by comfortable margins in every poll over the past 21 months,
topping McCarthy by 14 points in a final pre-election survey.
   Democrats with the safest seats appeared to include Sen. Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who is moving from Senate majority leader to
become chairman of the Appropriations Committee; Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, one of a trio
of senators seeking to succeed Byrd as Democratic leader.
   Republicans with no apparent re-election problems include Sens.
Richard Lugar of Indiana, Orrin Hatch of Utah, John Heinz of
Pennsylvania and John Danforth of Missouri.
   The election results will not mean the end of changes in the
Senate lineup.
   Both Texas Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Indiana Republican Dan
Quayle are their parties' vice presidential nominees. The winner, be
it Bentsen or Quayle, will have to be replaced. And the governors
ready to do the appointing are both Republicans.
   The 1988 Senate races had cost more than $157 million by Oct. 19.
About $43 million of the total came from political action committees
and other special-interest groups.
   The most money spent was in California: more than $13 million by
Wilson; about $8 million by McCarthy.
   Many negative Senate campaigns matched or exceeded the
name-calling in the presidential race.
   And many Republican candidates sought to link their names to that
of George Bush and to tie their opponents to Democrat Michael
Dukakis, especially in states where Bush was expected to do well.

   President Reagan congratulated George Bush and
Dan Quayle Tuesday evening on a ``historic victory'' after a long
and arduous campaign.
   ``Their mandate will continue the changes that create jobs,
prosperity and peace for all Americans,'' Reagan said in a statement
released after calling the GOP team.
   The president also offered praise to the Democratic candidates,
Michael Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, saying the two men,
``represented their party with strength and tenacity.''
   ``Nancy and I congratulate George Bush and Dan Quayle on their
historic victory,'' Reagan said.
   ``Now we must pull together and help the Vice President lead
America into the 1990s. I look forward to working with George and
his team on a smooth transition,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan telephoned Bush at 11:02 p.m. EST, and Quayle at 11:10
p.m. EST, after the closing of the polls in California, said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``He's excited and gratified,'' about the victory, the spokesman
said of the president. ``He offered his congratulations to both
men.''
   The president had spent Election Day ``rooting for George Bush''
and keeping a close watch on the contest between his vice president
and Dukakis, Reagan's chief of staff said.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan spent the evening
watching the returns and dining on a buffet supper in the White
House residence.
   The couple, who posed for pictures while watching election
reports on television in their private quarters, had invited Mrs.
Reagan's brother, Richard Davis, his family and several other
friends and associates to join them, aides said.
   ``He's keeping a close watch on everything,'' said Reagan's top
aide, Kenneth Duberstein. ``He's going to be watching the returns,
rooting for George Bush.''
   On Wednesday, Duberstein said, Bush and Quayle were expected to
meet with Reagan at the White House. Bush was to fly back to
Washington from Houston, while Quayle was spending the election
night in Washington.
   ``Bush and Quayle will both come and visit the president,''
Duberstein said.
   The president also planned to name the members of the team that
will prepare for the transfer of power to the next president, the
aide said.
   The chief of staff said Reagan, who made a near-midnight return
to the White House late Monday after a daylong trip to California on
Bush's behalf, awoke before 9 a.m. Tuesday and spent the afternoon
doing paperwork and meeting with advisers in the Oval Office.
   The president had made an unprecedented push on Bush's behalf,
making 30 appearances in 16 states since Labor Day.
   Reagan wrapped up a 25,000-mile political odyssey with Monday's
cross-country flight, attempting to gather support for Bush at
get-out-the-vote rallies in Long Beach and San Diego.

   It started on St. Patrick's Day in 1985.
Ronald Reagan had been inaugurated two months earlier, and Richard
Gephardt was at the Iowa City VFW hall opening the race to replace
him.
   The precise dates vary, but it's as good a point as any to mark
the beginning of the presidential campaign that ends, finally,
today. It was mind-numbing in length, rich in color and left
political activists yearning for a little peace and quiet.
   ``It's hard to believe this is going to be over, but it's time
for it to be over,'' said Iowa Republican Chairman Michael Mahaffey.
``There'll be a little letdown.''
   The race between Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis and
Republican nominee George Bush was just the final matchup of the
campaign for Iowans, who look back at nearly four years of rallies,
coffee klatches and barnyard tours.
   They watched Jesse Jackson milk a cow, Robert Dole drive a
tractor and Bruce Babbitt pedal a bike _ in summer and the dead of
winter.
   Iowa was the first testing ground for Gephardt's tough-talking
trade policies, Pat Robertson's ``invisible army'' of Christian
followers, Dole's ``I'm one of you'' theme and Paul Simon's return
to liberalism of earlier years.
   In the early rounds of the caucuses on Feb. 8, Bush suffered a
stunning loss, finishing third behind Dole and Robertson. Dukakis
also finished third behind Gephardt and Simon in a closer Democratic
contest.
   If today's decision brings a respite, the popular consensus is
that the peace and quiet could last all of 48 hours before yet
another campaign begins.
   ``They won't have time to rest because they get about a month off
and we're right back at it,'' said State Democratic Party Chairwoman
Bonnie Campbell.
   ``I'm not sure it ever comes to an end in Iowa. We have this kind
of perpetual campaign here,'' said Phil Roeder, who was spokesman
for the state Democratic Party until this spring.
   ``We'll have period of 24 or 48 hours for either celebration or
mourning, depending on what happens. It's the end of the end, and
then it's going to be the beginning of the beginning,'' he said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities soared in the latest auction to the highest levels in
more than three years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.54 percent, up from 7.37
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.71 percent, up from 7.48 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since May 13, 1985, when three-month
bills sold for 7.69 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.9 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.79 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,809.40 and and 8.13 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,610.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, edged down to 8.10
percent last week after averaging 8.13 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Non-California Wine Producers Seek More Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They make only little sips compared to
California's barrels, but vintners in the nation's 42 other
wine-producing states are thinking of organizing.
   They say they need a lobbyist. Soybeans, beef, pork and even
catfish enjoy special benefits from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, they say, so wine should, too.
   While the market for premium wines is exploding, vinters outside
California have been without Washington representation to fight for
favorable tax, trade, pesticide and labeling laws, says Richard J.
Feeney, who used to lobby for the meat industry and is now
organizing a trade association for winemakers.
   ``Until now,'' he says in a letter to prospective members of the
National Vintners Association, ``wine has not been looked upon as
agricultural and has not been able to share these benefits. The time
has come for wine to take its place with other agricultural
commodities.''
   John Fitzgerald, director of the Texas Wine Marketing Institute,
says he sees a need for non-California winemakers to form a united
front in Washington ``since California is not going to do it.''
   Why should it, Fitzgerald says, ``when it controls 90 percent of
the sales, 90 percent of the attention, 90 percent of the funding
and 90 percent of the lobbying.''
   California has its own trade group, the Wine Institute. The catch
for wineries in 42 other states is that only California operators
can belong, Feeney said. According to Feeney, no wine is produced in
six states _ Alaska, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska
and Delaware. In Kansas, no wine is made yet, but a permit has been
issued.
   While California produces a significant portion of bulk wine,
other states such as Texas and Virginia are in a position to
capitalize on the growing market for premium wines, Fitzgerald and
Feeney said.
   Premium wine sales rose 21 percent last year, accounting for 20
percent of sales and 40 percent of revenues, Fitzgerald said.
   In Texas alone, the 25 commercial wineries bottled 500,000
gallons in 1988 with retail sales of $20 million, says Andy Welch,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture. The Lone Star
State accounts for 1 or 2 percent of the total market.
   While the marketing future for premium wines is good, Feeney says
the legislative and regulatory climate toward alcoholic beverages
``poses a multitude of threats.'' He believes winemakers can best
head them off by aligning with the agricultural sector and away from
spirits.
   ``If legislators and regulators are fully and persuasively
informed about the special requirements for grape growers and wine
makers, and that table wine is in reality a food beverage, treatment
will be more to the industry's benefit,'' Feeney wrote.
   ``Wine is a beverage of moderation, it is a food complement,''
says Ed Auler, co-owner of Fall Creek Vineyards in Tow, Texas.
``Europeans have known it for centuries and Americans are in the
process of discovering it at a time neo-prohibitionists are coming
at you in every direction _ in taxation, labeling, overaggressive
DWI legislation.''
   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng argues that wine has always
been considered an agricultural product and questioned the need for
a national wine lobbying association. Lyng is from Modesto, Calif.,
home of wine powerhouse Ernest and Julio Gallo.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Set to Resume Rural Development Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's rural areas are suffering from a
serious case of neglect, says a group of farm-state lawmakers
already campaigning to provide the countryside with a federally
financed facelift.
   ``Rural Americans are worried that the state of the economy in
their communities will force them to abandon their chosen way of
life,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said at a recent news conference.
   The long-running debate over rural development seems certain to
come in for renewed debate on Capitol Hill next year, no matter
which of the contenders captures the White House.
   Broader than a mere farm issue, rural development focuses on vast
stretches of land and takes in problems ranging from backed up sewer
systems in country towns to persuading companies to move to places
best known for cows and plows.
   Lawmakers calling for stepped-up rural development point to
higher poverty rates among the 54 million Americans who live outside
urban centers _ and note that farmers represent only a fraction of
that number.
   Rural America's poverty rate currently is running at 18 percent,
well above the urban level, and the unemployment rate remains 2.6
percent higher in the countryside than in the cities, according to
statistics compiled by the National Governors Association.
   Rural areas will be gaining jobs for the rest of this century at
only 73 percent of the urban rate, according to the group's
projections.
   Demands for congressional action started in the mid-1980s as a
reaction to small-town distress that stemmed in part from crop
surpluses that hurt farm incomes.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
convened two sessions of the panel this fall with the aim of
producing a rural development bill. But the effort fizzled amid
questions about the price tag.
   Leahy, however, has been calling for resumed action next year.
   Money remains an obstacle. It is in short supply as Congress
wrestles with towering budget deficits. Indeed, levels of many rural
programs have come down during the Reagan years.
   The Agriculture Department, for example, provided rural areas
with $290 million in water and waste disposal grants in 1980. That
climbed dropped to $125 million in 1982, see-sawed in the mid-1980s
and has held steady over the last three years at $109.4 million.
   But money is not the only obstacle. Priorities are important, too.
   Since the mid-1980s rural development has proven itself
attractive enough politically to get talked about. But issues with
more powerful voter appeal always seem to get the lion's share of
the attention. Only a few lawmakers from the most rural states are
persistent advocates.
   ``Rural and small town Americans are asking the federal
government to help them make rural life economically viable _ We
cannot ignore their dilemma,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., one of
the few lawmakers who consistently ride herd on the issue.
   While incapable thus far of galvanizing intense support, the
concept has drawn backing from surprising quarters.
   Economist Fred Sanderson of the Washington-based think tank
Resources for the Future, for one, is often an outspoken critic of
large farm subsidies. But he takes a tolerant view of increased
federal spending on rural development.
   ``We're rather favorably disposed to the idea as something
essentially for adjustment, giving employment to part-time farmers''
or even as a way to ``move them out of farming altogether where they
can't make a living on the land,'' says Sanderson.
   But he warns that it would be expensive. Even so much as $100
million, he says, would merely be ``a drop in the bucket.''
   Another unresolved matter: Just what is rural development anyway?
   Some of the dozens of rural development bills that have tumbled
into the hopper in recent years concentrate on ``infrastructure:''
replacing worn-out bridges, repaving pothole-pocked roads and
putting in new storm sewers.
   Increasingly, though, a more sophisticated focus has crept into
the issue, with new stress on matters such as education and
communications.
   Leahy's bill this fall sought to speed development of
telecommunications systems for rural areas as a way of ending their
traditional isolation and making it easier for companies to locate
there.
   Thus far, urban critics of farm spending have not been critical
of such bills, primarily because they have yet to reach the floor in
any comprehensive form. Recent gains have all been piecemeal.
   If such a measure does come in for a major floor debate, though,
the critics are likely to point out that indoor plumbing and rural
electrification were luxuries for many rural residents only a few
decades ago, suggesting that perhaps the countryside is not really
all that bad off.

   The Soviet Union has purchased an additional
300,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal for delivery this marketing
year, the Agriculture Department says.
   Further details were not released in the department's
announcement Monday.
   But the sale could have a value of more than $67 million, based
on average USDA market estimates of around $225 per ton in the
current marketing year.
   The Soviets last week purchased 535,000 metric tons of soybean
meal and 250,000 tons of soybeans for delivery in the 1988-89
marketing year, which started Oct. 1.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 830,000 tons of soybeans and
1.3 million tons of soybean meal in 1987-88.

   Proposals for more federal aid for America's
homeless are likely to fare poorly next year, no matter who wins
today's presidential election, says a leading activist for the
homeless.
   ``It's going to be a long fight,'' said Mitch Snyder, head of the
Center for Creative Non-Violence. ``America's politicians haven't
shown much concern about the homeless.''
   But Snyder was more critical of Vice President George Bush, the
Republican candidate, than Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis.
   ``We've already seen what Bush can do during the eight years of
the Reagan administration,'' Snyder said. ``I think things will be
easier under Dukakis.''
   Snyder's comments Monday came as 377 people were arrested at the
Capitol, capping a long series of protests organized by Snyder.
   The protests began Sept. 26, and 239 people had been arrested
before Monday's big demonstration. Most of them had been charged
with unlawful entry.
   About 2,000 people took part in a march and a 90-minute rally
that preceded Monday's arrests, according to Dan Nichols, a
spokesman for the Capitol police.
   After the rally in a park across the street from the Capitol,
hundreds of people followed Snyder's appeal to sit down in the
middle of Constitution Avenue. Snyder told the crowd those arrested
would be fined $25.
   The protest and arrests had been coordinated beforehand with
Capitol police, said Nichols and Snyder. The 377 people arrested
were charged with disorderly conduct, Nichols said.
   Their hands tied behind them with plastic handcuffs, the
protesters were quietly taken to waiting buses and driven off to be
booked. The arrests were generally quiet.
   One of those arrested with Benjamin Spock, the famous
pediatrician and social activist. Minutes before his arrest Spock
told the rally that ``the Reagan administration is not treating the
children and homeless right.''
   Another speaker was Cher, the Academy Award-winning actress who
had taken part in the march from a motel five miles away. She left
the march to promote her new line of perfume, ``Uninhibited,'' but
returned to the rally in a black van limousine. She left shortly
before the arrests began.
   She explained, ``I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to go do my job.
I'm here to show my concern and my support for the homeless. I'm
very committed to the cause of the homeless. People have to have it
brought into their consciousness that the plight of the homeless is
very serious.''
   The rally had some of the trappings of a political gathering,
with dozens of people in the crowd sporting ``Dukakis-Bentsen''
buttons and signs in support of the Democratic presidential ticket.
No signs of support for Bush were apparent.

<HEAD>Housing Discrimination Case Opens Door to More Challenges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's ruling that Huntington,
N.Y., illegally practiced racial segregation in housing could spur
new challenges to allegedly discriminatory local zoning laws.
   In a 6-3 decision Monday, the justices upheld a ruling that
Huntington officials reinforced racial segregation by confining
housing for low-income families to a predominantly nonwhite, urban
renewal area.
   However, the court stopped short of deciding the key issue in the
case: whether zoning regulations violate the federal Civil Rights
Act of 1968 when the local laws have racially discriminatory effects
but there is no proof they are intentionally biased.
   Instead the justices, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, accepted
the result of a ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
without endorsing the appeals court's reasoning.
   Although it is not definitive, the high court ruling could give
civil rights groups new ammunition to challenge community zoning
ordinances that limit low-cost housing.
   Huntington officials conceded that the town's zoning policies had
a ``disparate impact'' on minorities regardless of their intent, the
justices said.
   ``We are satisfied on this record that disparate impact was
shown, and that the sole justification proffered (to throw out) the
case was inadequate,'' the high court said. ``We do not reach the
question whether (the disparate impact) test is the appropriate
one.''
   Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens
dissented. They voted to hear arguments in the case to explore the
issue.
   The 2nd Circuit court said statistics showing a zoning
ordinance's discriminatory effects, even if unintentional, could
establish a violation of the 1968 law.
   The alternative approach _ supported by the Reagan administration
among others _ would require the more difficult task of proving the
zoning ordinance is intentionally biased.
   Administration lawyers supported the appeal by Huntington
officials.
   ``Congress intended to require a showing of intentional
discrimination'' when it passed the fair housing law, Justice
Department lawyers said.
   The 2nd Circuit court ruled last April that Huntington's zoning
ordinance perpetuated segregation by confining to a predominantly
black area subsidized apartments designed to benefit poorer families.
   ``The disproportionate harm to blacks and the segregative impact
on the entire community resulting from the refusal to rezone create
a strong ... showing of discriminatory effect,'' the appeals court
said.
   The town failed to present ``bona fide and legitimate
justifications for its action'' or show there were ``no less
discriminatory alternatives available,'' the appeals court added.
   Huntington, a Long Island community of some 200,000 residents,
has a black population of less than 3.5 percent. Most blacks live in
two neighborhoods.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
along with a local group called Housing Help Inc., sued the town in
1981 for its refusal to approve multi-family dwellings on a
14.8-acre site in Greenlawn, a predominantly white hamlet of
single-family houses.
   Housing Help Inc. proposed to build 162 federally subsidized
low-income apartments there.
   Huntington officials noted that the town has 775 low-income
housing units and said it has done its fair share in developing
subsidized dwellings.
   But the 2nd Circuit court said confining such apartments to the
urban renewal area has a disproportionate impact on blacks.
   While the appeals court acknowledged there are more poor whites
than blacks in the community, it noted that only 7 percent of all
Huntington families needed subsidized housing while 24 percent of
black families needed such help.
   Placing low-income housing in predominantly white Greenlawn will
promote integration, the 2nd Circuit court said.
   In other developments, the Supreme Court:
   _Said it will decide in cases from New York and Virginia whether
the government may seize money and property that criminal defendants
use to pay their lawyers, setting the stage for a ruling on a key
crime-fighting weapon.
   _Refused to reinstate an unusual racial quota system designed to
prevent ``white flight'' from a New York City public housing
development, the largest in the nation.
   _Agreed to study the case of a former Dallas high school football
coach who says he lost his job because he is white.

   An American student who was aboard a Jordanian
airliner seized by terrorists in 1985 says he is positive that
hijacking defendant Fawaz Younis led the ``horde of men'' who
stormed the plane in Beirut.
   ``I recognize him as the leader of the hijackers,'' said William
L. Slade, pointing across a courtroom toward Younis, who was seated
at the defense table.
   ``How sure are you about that?'' asked Justice Department
prosecutor Karen Morrissette.
   ``Positive,'' replied Slade, whose testimony Monday in U.S.
District Court marked the first time Younis had been publicly
identified by one of the victims of the June 11, 1985 hijacking of a
Royal Jordanian Airline jet.
   The Boeing 727 was seized by five heavily armed men as it was
preparing to take off for Amman, Jordan.
   ``About two minutes before takeoff, I heard a great deal of
gunfire outside the aircraft,'' Slade testified. ``A whole horde of
men stormed onto the airplane.''
   ``My gut instinct was to duck, I crouched into my chair,''
recalled Slade. The group started ``beating everything in their way
onto the floor.''
   When things calmed down, Slade, 21, said he noticed that two
hijackers were standing at the rear of the plane and another was
stationed in first class. A fourth hijacker patrolled the aisle
between the two sections of the cabin and the group's leader was in
the cockpit.
   The hijackers who took over the passenger section identified a
group of five or six Jordanian sky marshals and ``proceeded to beat
them thoroughly and torture them.''
   None of the passengers was attacked by the hijackers, he said.
   Slade said he could see the leader in the cockpit from where he
was seated in the back of the plane next to his father, Landry
Slade, a former professor at the American University in Beirut.
   Slade said the hijackers' leader emerged from the cockpit 10
times during the 39-hour ordeal in which the plane was ordered flown
to Cyprus, Tunisia, Sicily, back to Cyprus and then to Beirut.
   Slade testified that Younis came within four or five feet of him
several times during the flight and that he got a good look at his
face when he left the plane.
   ``I shook his hand at the end of the ordeal. I was very close
him,'' Slade said, recalling that he looked at Younis in the eye.
   The hijackers blew up the plane at Beirut International Airport
shortly after the aircraft's 72 passengers and crew members were
released. Younis was also photographed reading a statement at a
press conference that the hijackers held before the plane was blown
up.
   The videotape is expected to be played at the end of this week's
hearing, after five other hijacking victims, including Slade's
father, testify.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker convened the hearing to
determine whether to admit the eyewitness identification of Younis
as evidence when the case goes to trial next year.
   The trial had been scheduled to begin Nov. 14, but the government
is appealing an order that it turn over some classified documents to
the defense.
   Slade said he knew Younis was the leader of the group because he
carried a two-way radio and barked orders when he emerged from the
cockpit.
   Slade said Younis was ``dressed in a flak jacket with a black
headband around his head'' and wore green khaki pants.
   The defendant was ``heavily armed'' and wore ``a vest that
contained ammunition clips as well as hand grenades,'' Slade said.
   Younis mostly went to the passenger section of the plane to tell
his fellow hijackers to stop beating the Jordanian sky marshals,
Slade said.
   He said they followed Younis' orders, but when he left the cabin,
the hijackers ``would start laughing and begin doing it again.''

<HEAD>Company Agrees To Pay Fine, Halt `Dial-a-Porn'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators say a $50,000 fine imposed
on a California ``dial-a-porn'' company should demonstrate to other
such operators that they must keep their material inaccessible to
minors.
   Audio Enterprises Inc., of Mill Valley, Calif., and operator
Wendy King agreed to the fine and to stop using interstate telephone
lines to transmit obscene messages.
   It was one of the first dial-a-porn fines imposed by the Federal
Communications Commission.
   ``The $50,000 payment that the dial-a-porn operator will have to
pay to the government ... shows that there will be a high price
attached to failure to obey the law scrupulously in this important
area,'' Gerald Brock, head of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said
Monday. ``This sends a signal there are some teeth in the law.''
   FCC officials said Audio Enterprises is effectively out of
business. There was no current listing for the company in telephone
information.
   To resume operations, King or Audio Enterprises must tone down
the messages and use access codes, credit cards or scrambling
equipment to prevent children under 18 from dialing. Such operations
will be monitored by the FCC, according to the agreement.
   The FCC launched its investigation of Audio Enterprises after a
mother in California wrote that her 13-year-old son and his friends
spent $74 dialing a pay-to-listen 900-number for 211 minutes.
   Also listening was the woman's daughter, who was later molested
by two boys who had heard the tapes, the woman wrote. ``This phone
call has damaged our lives,'' the woman wrote.
   The FCC informed Audio Enterprises last December that it was in
apparent violation of FCC's rules that require companies to restrict
access to obscene material. The commission also informed Intercambio
Inc., of San Jose, Calif., that it was in violation of the law. That
case is pending.
   The FCC declared that the material broadcast by the two companies
was obscene. Under a Supreme Court's test, material is obscene if it
depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way, appeals to the
prurient interest of an average person and lacks serious literary or
artistic value.
   FCC officials estimated Audio Enterprises collected about
$250,000 in revenues over a two-year period.
   Altogether, the dial-a-porn industry produces about $54 million
annually in revenue for providers and phone companies, according to
the Information Industry Bulletin.
   The FCC has referred some complaints to the Justice Department.
In May 1987, two dial-a-porn providers pleaded guilty to failing to
comply with the commission's rule. The court fined them each $50,000.
   Earlier this year, Congress passed a sweeping dial-a-porn law
that bans obscene and indecent commercial messages. The law has not
been enforced because of legal challenges in New York and California.

<HEAD>Howard Baker Reportedly Under Consideration For Wall Street Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the embattled Wall
Street investment firm, has been negotiating with former White House
aide Howard H. Baker Jr. about becoming its chairman, The Washington
Post reported today.
   Drexel is the subject of a massive civil-fraud case and the
target of a federal grand jury probe.
   The Post, citing sources it did not identify, reported that some
senior Drexel executives hoped Baker's arrival would persuade
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani not to name the firm in
an expected racketeering indictment.
   Baker, reached late Monday night at his home in Huntsville,
Tenn., declined to comment on the report.
   ``I can't give you anything on that now,'' said the former
Tennessee senator and White House chief of staff.
   Drexel also declined to comment, but it issued a statement
acknowledging that it has been working with Baker and his Tennessee
law firm ``on matters relating to internal corporate governance, and
which are unrelated to either the ongoing investigation by the U.S.
attorney or any Washington matters.''
   ``It would be entirely inappropriate to comment or speculate on
any subject which is under review or discussion between Drexel,
(Baker), and his law firm,'' the statement said.
   Baker left the post of White House chief of staff last July and
rejoined his Knoxville law firm, Baker Worthington Crossley
Stansberry & Woolf.
   Sources cited by the Post noted that Baker in 1987 offered
Giuliani the post of chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a job the prosecutor turned down.
   Drexel's current chairman is Robert E. Linton, but the firm's
day-to-day operations are supervised by chief executive Fred Joseph.
   In a massive civil suit filed Sept. 7, the SEC accused Drexel and
other defendants of scheming with now-imprisoned insider trader Ivan
Boesky to break a litany of securities-fraud laws. The defendants
have denied the accusations.
   The suit was stalled last month when the 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York agreed to consider Drexel's request to
disqualify the lower-court judge presiding over the SEC case.
   Meanwhile, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which has been
investigating Drexel's relationship with Boesky since he turned
state's evidence almost two years ago, is widely expected to seek
indictments of the firm soon.
   In October, the U.S. attorney's office notified Drexel in a
so-called ``target letter'' that a grand jury was considering
whether to charge the firm with securities fraud under the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. Drexel
repeatedly has denied wrongdoing.

   Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos
returned Monday night from a week-long trip to New York, tearfully
calling her court appearance on federal racketeering charges the
``most inhuman experience of my life.''
   Mrs. Marcos traveled to New York to plead innocent to the
charges. She and her husband, 71-year-old Ferdinand, are accused of
plundering $103 million from the Philippine treasury, funneling it
to foreign bank accounts and using it to buy prime New York City
real estate and art.
   ``I've just come back from the most harrowing and most inhuman
experience of my life,'' she told reporters and about two dozen
supporters waiting at the Honolulu International Airport.
   Mrs. Marcos, wife of former Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos, arrived aboard a jet owned by tobacco heiress Doris Duke, a
long-time friend who also arranged for a $5 million bond so Mrs.
Marcos could return to Hawaii.
   Mrs. Marcos got out of a black limousine which picked her up at
planeside and met with a group of supporters, hugging two of them
who gave her roses.
   One supporter carried a sign reading: ``Praise the law. Justice
for the President and first lady Marcos will prevail.''
   Choking back tears, Mrs. Marcos addressed the group and reporters.
   ``I now pray ... you (the U.S. government) will honor the
territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines, a Third
World country, respect our constitution and our laws and above all,
give every human being our right to our dignity,'' she said.
   Sobbing, she said ``God bless America. God Bless the
Philippines,'' and got into the limousine for the 15-minute ride to
the Marcoses' hillside estate overlooking Honolulu.
   After spending several days at Miss Duke's New Jersey estate,
Mrs. Marcos and her 12-member entourage left Sunday aboard the
Boeing 737 and spent Sunday night at the home of her daughter, Irene
Araneta, in a suburb of San Francisco.
   Ferdinand Marcos remained in Hawaii after his attorneys told a
federal judge Marcos was too ill to make the trip.
   The Marcoses are required to appear before FBI agents here
Wednesday to give fingerprints, palm prints as well as voice and
handwriting samples under the terms of a court order issued in New
York.

America, rounded out the top 10 with $1.31 million.

   Rock star John Fogerty got a favorable
review from a federal jury, which determined that he hadn't stolen
one of his own Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for his solo
career.
   The six-member U.S. District Court jury Monday unanimously
rejected a plagiarism lawsuit by Fantasy Records, which holds the
rights to Creedence songs.
   The suit, one of several in a long-running feud between Fogerty
and his former recording company, claimed his 1984 composition,
``Old Man Down the Road,'' copied the tune from ``Run Through the
Jungle,'' which Fogerty wrote and sang for Creedence in 1970.
   ``Old Man'' sold about 150,000 copies and was the lead single
from Fogerty's solo ``Centerfield'' album, his first major
commercial success since Creedence disbanded in 1972. The suit
sought a substantial share of the profits from the single and the
album, which sold more than 2 million copies.
   Fogerty's defense included two days on the witness stand with
guitar in hand, playing many of his compositions to demonstrate his
style. He contended any similarities between the songs were part of
his ``swamp rock'' style.
   At a post-verdict news conference, Fogerty, 43, said, ``William
Shakespeare, John Lennon, (Bob) Dylan and maybe (Bruce) Springsteen
(were) saying, `Johnny, don't blow this.' How can you not sound like
yourself?''
   The jurors were ``awed by a superstar and the performance that
was put on,'' said Malcolm Burnstein, a lawyer for Fantasy Records.

   Marvin Mitchelson, the celebrity divorce
lawyer for clients such as ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins, met with
state bar association officials but didn't resolve pending
misconduct charges.
   ``There is no question this is a witch hunt,'' Mitchelson told
reporters as he left a two-hour closed conference Monday with two
bar prosecutors and a referee.
   Mitchelson stands accused of six charges, including charging
excessive fees and failing to place clients' funds in trust funds.
Two of the cases in which complaints were filed involved actress
Julie Newmar and Eleanor Revson, sister-in-law of the founder of
Revlon Cosmetics.
   Attorney Arthur Margolis, who represented Mitchelson, said the
failure to resolve the charges means that Mitchelson will have to
face a disciplinary hearing, probably in January.
   Mitchelson said the charges were ``ill-conceived and I believe I
will be vindicated.''
   ``I have never seen them (the bar) go after anybody like this,''
Margolis said. ``They would not have done this if it was not Marvin
Mitchelson.''

   Gucci heir Maurizio Gucci, who could have
been sent to jail for three years and fined $23 million for
attempted tax fraud, received a one-year suspended sentence and a
$750 fine.
   Gucci's conviction and sentencing Monday means he will regain
control of shares that will give him half of the Gucci luxury goods
company, said his lawyer, Vittorio Ajello.
   Gucci was accused of arranging the falsification of a signature
on documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by making it appear
his father, Rodolfo, transferred ownership of the shares before his
death in 1983.
   His ownership of the shares was not in question, only when the
transfer was made. The court froze the shares to assure he could pay
any fine levied in the case.
   Under Monday's decision, Gucci's criminal record will be expunged
at the end of a year and will have to pay the inheritance tax on the
shares.
   Gucci is the great grandson of Guccio Gucci, who founded the
company in 1922.

   Dr. Ruth Westheimer says religious
training helped prepare her become the nation's best-known sex
therapist.
   ``In the Talmud it says that a lesson taught with humor is a
lesson retained,'' Westheimer said of the collection of rabbinic
commentary that constitutes Jewish law. ``And in human sexuality
this is very important.''
   ``My success is not only because I'm outspoken, I can use humor
and I'm very well trained,'' she said during a visit Saturday to the
University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. ``I am successful because there
is a need in society.''
   She described herself as a sex educator who does not promote sex
but ``sexual literacy,'' explaining, ``I think most of the
difficulties stem from being unable to communicate.''
   She said her success happened purely by chance.
   ``I never would have dreamed, coming from an Orthodox Jewish
background, that I would talk about (sex) across the world,'' she
said.

   Lew Ayres, who starred in the 1930
anti-war movie ``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' decried rising
violence in American movies, saying opponents can reverse the trend
only by making it socially unacceptable.
   In the keynote address to a weekend symposium on the roots of
violence, the 80-year-old Ayres said movie violence perpetuates
itself because audiences find it exciting.
   ``Movies don't use violence without reason,'' he said. ``They are
there to make money.''
   Ayres was 21 when he starred in ``All Quiet on the Western
Front,'' which won Oscars for best picture and best director. His
role as a World War I German soldier was among the first sympathetic
film portrayals of a war enemy.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the Afghan resistance alliance is
asking for U.S. money to help refugees and to rehabilitate his
war-torn country in talks today with State Department officials.
   There was no advance price tag as Burhanuddin Rabbani outlined
his plans for Afghanistan's future. At a session Monday with
Undersecretary of State Michael H. Armacost he gave an initial
description of the elections he said he wants to hold in January to
select a new government in Kabul.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Rabbani did not ask for additional American military aid to carry
out the guerrillas' fight against pro-Moscow government forces.
   ``They didn't come in pressing for more guns,'' the official
said. ``They are confident of their ability to see this war to its
end.''
   Although the level of U.S. military support remains secret, the
rebels are believed to have received several hundred million dollars
in recent years. Much of the aid, including shoulder-fired Stinger
missiles, is channeled through Pakistan.
   Rabbani, who sees President Reagan and Secretary of State George
P. Shultz on Wednesday, is the leader of the Islamic Society
guerrilla group and of the main rebel alliance. He had talks
scheduled today with Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Williamson, who coordinates humanitarian aid to the rebels, and with
the Agency for International Development.
   ``It was a very cordial meeting,'' a U.S. official reported after
Monday's session. ``There was a restating of our support for the
Mujahedeen. Both sides gave their assessment of the issues.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Rabbani
and Armacost just ``touched on'' the guerrilla leader's plan, and
that it would receive more extensive consideration later in the week.
   The Reagan administration already has registered its general
support for a political settlement, provided it involves
self-determination for the Afghan people. Before Rabbani's arrival,
U.S. officials said his plan, which would exclude communists,
offered ``a promising channel'' to that end.
   Reports from Pakistan, which also backs the rebels, indicated
Rabbani may ask for more advanced weapons from the United States.
But the guerrillas are making gains with the arms they already have,
and a U.S. official said ``it would seem they are well-fixed.''
   Rabbani's plan for a new government involves negotiating a
cease-fire with Afghan forces. Even the introduction of Soviet
Backfire and MiG warplanes and SS-1 Scud missiles have not averted
the government's impending loss of Knadahar, the country's
second-largest city.
   The State Department has counseled the guerrillas to exercise
restraint toward Soviet troops, all of which are supposed to be out
of the country by Feb. 15. But the rebels have not been asked to
take it easy on the Afghan forces.
   Half the more than 100,000 Soviet troops in the country since
1979 were withdrawn Aug. 15. But last week, Soviet First Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertynkh said the pullout had been
suspended because of strong attacks by the rebels.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Monday that the
United States still expects the Soviets to comply with ``the
obligation that they have undertaken'' in the Geneva accords last
spring.
   He said the Soviets fired three more Scud missiles into eastern
Afghanistan on Sunday and the Soviets continued their air operations
over the weekend.

   The Conservative movement of Judaism has called
on Israel's Likud bloc and Labor party to withstand demands by
Orthodox parties that hold the balance in Israeli politics.
   Neither Likud nor Labor emerged from last week's parliamentary
elections with enough seats to form a majority. The 18 seats won by
several small Orthodox parties could give either side a majority.
   Among demands being made by the Israeli religious parties are
outlawing abortion and autopsies and halting mass transit on the
Sabbath. They also want automatic Israeli citizenship be available
to converts to Judaism only if their conversions were performed by
Orthodox rabbis.
   The statement by the Conservative movement was released at the
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York and urged Labor and Likud to
``reject the blackmail demands,'' The New York Times reported today.
   Orthodox Rabbi Max Schreir, the president of the Rabbinical
Council of Anmerica, responded saying, ``Remember, their (Orthodox)
gains were won in a democratic election.''

<HEAD>Israeli Soldier, Two Palestinians Die</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Palestinian revolt claimed victims on both
sides when an Arab worker stabbed an Israeli soldier to death and
was himself killed, and Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian
woman in a separate clash.
   Cpl. David Danieli, 28, a teacher from the coastal town of
Ashkelon, was on army reserve duty guarding a Jewish cooperative
farm in the occupied West Bank when he was killed Monday by a
21-year-old Palestinian worker.
   The farm, Massua Moshav, is 26 miles northeast of Jerusalem and
about one mile from the Jordanian border. It relies on the day labor
of about 100 Palestinian workers to cultivate bananas, grapes, dates
and flowers.
   Residents of the farm said the young Palestinian approached the
soldier and demanded back wages of about $100, but the soldier asked
to see identification papers before letting the worker into the farm.
   At that point, the witnesses said, the worker shouted ``Allahu
Akbar'' _ Arabic for ``God is Great'' _ then stabbed the soldier
repeatedly. A Jewish farmer shot and killed the assailant moments
later, they said.
   ``In the beginning there was a struggle. In the end, the Arab
just kept stabbing all the time, he didn't stop,'' said Tanya
Ben-Ami, a settler who witnessed the attack from the cooperative's
central office.
   The Palestinian was identified as Ahmad Hussein Abdullah Basharat
of Tamoun village, near Jenin. Troops imposed a curfew on Tamoun
following the incident and blew up Basharat's house, a military
spokesman said.
   The Israeli army routinely demolishes houses as a punishment for
attacks. The measure is also viewed as a deterrent for future
attacks.
   Responding to the Israeli soldier's death, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said: ``We cannot go on without a proper response to
what happened here today.''
   Also Monday, the army raided dozens of West Bank villages, and
troops shot and killed a 23-year-old Palestinian woman during a
clash with protesters in Salem near Nablus, a military spokesman
said.
   At least 21 other Arabs were wounded in the day's unrest, Arab
hospital officials said.
   The 1.5 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, have been
protesting Israeli rule for almost 11 months. Monday's deaths raised
the number of victims in the revolt to 309 Palestinians and 11
Israelis.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced that it will
begin accepting nominations for elections May 7 to fill posts
including the presidency, which the armed forces has dominated since
a 1968 military coup.
   Neither acting President Manuel Solis Palma nor Gen. Manual
Antonio Noriega, who as Defense Forces commanders controls Panama,
have said if they will run for president.
   Five parties have said they will nominate candidates, while three
say they will boycott the elections.
   Voters will cast ballots for a president, two vice presidents,
the 67 members of the National Assembly and local government
officials.
   Solis has been acting president since February, shortly after a
federal grand jury in Florida indicted Noriega on drug trafficking
charges. Then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega,
but the Noriega-dominated National Assembly dismissed Delvalle and
replaced him with Solis.
   The United States, which has imposed economic sanctions against
Panama in an unsuccessful attempt to force Noriega to resign, still
recognizes Delvalle as president.
   If Noriega should run he would by law have to resign as Defense
Forces commander by Feb. 7.
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta, running as the government candidate, won
the presidential election in 1984. He resigned in 1985 under
pressure because of differences with the Defense Forces and Vice
President Delvalle succeeded him.
   Solis told the party leaders Monday to choose their candidates
carefully.
   ``Let's not see the same sad situation of the great country to
the north,'' he said, referring to the United States. He claimed
most elected U.S. officials do not represent the American people.
   In another apparent reference to the United States, he told party
officials not to ``accept corrupt money from outside sources that
could change the destiny of our nation.''
   The three legally registered parties that have declared they will
not participate in the May balloting are the Christian Democrats,
the Liberal Republican Movement and the Authentic Panamanian Party.
   Five parties have said they will nominate national and local
candidates. They are the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party, the
National Action Party, the Democratic Workers Party, the Republican
Party and the new People's Party.
   Solis on Monday formally accepted documents to legalize the
People's Party, which had been the Communist Party.
   The Communist Party participated in the 1984 presidential
election, but lost its official standing because it didn't receive
the 10,000-vote minimum required to maintain its legal status.
   The president and vice president to be elected in May will serve
five-year terms beginning June 7.
   More than 1.2 million people are registered to vote. There were
917,000 registered for the 1984 presidential election, of which
about 640,000 cast votes.

   A new $950,00 grant should help scholars
complete a dictionary of late Middle Ages English by the mid-1990s,
more than 60 years after the project began, officials say.
   The grant is the third awarded to the University of Michigan
Middle English Dictionary project by the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, said Editor in Chief Robert E. Lewis, a professor of
English at the Ann Arbor school.
   ``When completed, the MED will be the definitive historical and
descriptive treatment of the lexicon of the Middle English period, a
seminal period in the history of English both in its own right and
as the threshold to modern English, the language we speak and write
today,'' Lewis said.
   Work on the 15,000-page dictionary, a compilation of English
vocabulary between the years 1100 and 1500, began in 1930.
   The dictionary began serial publication in 1952. The 11,000 pages
of completed portions bring the dictionary halfway through letter
``S'' entries.
   The Mellon Foundation already awarded $950,000 to the project in
1974 and $600,000 in 1982.
   Researchers needed four years to complete part of the ``M'' and
``N'' entries, said Professor Sherman M. Kuhn, who directed the
project in 1979. A computer-assisted production system added in 1984
has doubled their output, Lewis said.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grew $1.9 Billion In September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer debt grew at its smallest pace in
nearly a year in September as Americans took out $1.88 billion more
in credit than they paid off.
   The Federal Reserve said Monday that the September increase in
consumer debt was down from an August rise of $5.32 billion and was
the smallest monthly advance since a $1.79 billion rise in November
1987.
   ``There are increasing signs that consumers are becoming more
cautious as they cut back on spending and try to reduce their debt
loads,'' Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said
of the latest figures.
   From July through September, consumer debt rose at an annual rate
of 6.75 percent, down significantly from a 10.2 percent growth rate
in the first six months of the year.

<HEAD>Report Faults State Department On Security Checks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Congressional investigators say the State
Department has failed to update its security checks on thousands of
employees who have access to top secret information.
   The General Accounting Office said in a report Monday that only
about one-quarter of the 9,000 long-term State Department workers
have been subjected to updated security investigations.
   ``About 44 percent of those eligible have not been reinvestigated
in the past 10 years or longer, and dozens of employees have not
been reinvestigated in 25 years or more,'' the GAO said.
   The number of people not reinvestigated after five years was
6,739, according to the GAO, which is the investigative arm of
Congress.

   It's taken patience and ingenuity, but a
crime lab has finally stopped thieves from pilfering the county's
stash of confiscated marijuana. The mice are gone.
   Brazoria County Crime Lab Director Michael Manes says workers
decided something had to be done because the critters became bolder
and bolder as they developed a love for their newfound food, kept in
a vault.
   Because the drug had given them a false sense of security, it got
to the point where the mice simply would sit and stare at workers
when they opened the darkened vault rather than scurry from the
light, said Manes.
   The first move against the mice was to place drugs that might be
needed in court cases in steel cabinets so no evidence would be
destroyed.
   But an attempt to catch the mice with poisoned food met with
little success because they seemed to prefer marijuana seeds to
cheese. The cheese rotted as the bags of marijuana continued to be
gnawed open.
   Manes said about the only luck they had in catching the mice was
when one would accidentally step on a trap as it walked from one bag
of pot to another.
   ``We soon just put them around the room without any bait and
hoped they'd stumble into one,'' he said.
   A combination of poisoned marijuana, poisoned water and traps has
nearly wiped out the lab's mouse population.
   But a large jar of preserved rodent bodies serves as a reminder
that the penalty for marijuana-eating mice at the lab is death.

   Looking for a dream home? A castle perhaps?
There's one for sale, albeit unfinished, in this Kentucky city.
   The mysterious landmark behind a scalloped stone wall and with 12
turrets was placed on the market this week by owner Rex Martin. He
placed a newspaper advertisement seeking bids to a post office box
number.
   The castle was conceived in Europe when Martin's wife, Caroline
Martin, on a vacation, thought it would be lovely to have a wall
surrounding one's home. They bought 53 acres and broke ground for
the castle in 1969.
   But by 1975, when the castle was still a shell of its future
self, the Martins divorced. Mrs. Martin said the last time she was
inside the castle was about three years ago.
   When finished, it was supposed to have seven bedrooms and 15
baths, including one in each of the four turrets along the wall and
two for the tower cabana. There was supposed to be an Italian
fountain and tennis courts.
   But Martin, a real-estate developer, never finished the structure
and never, reportedly, lived in it.
   ``Rex was busy doing other things,'' Mrs. Martin said.
   In its unfinished state, the county has valued the structure at
$554,000 for tax purposes.

   As President Reagan bade a sentimental farewell
to White House politics and urged voters to ``stand by me,'' his
pollster predicted that Vice President George Bush would win the
presidency with a comfortable electoral margin today.
   ``I don't think it's going to be a close race,'' pollster Richard
Wirthlin told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday as he
accompanied the president to California, where Reagan wound up a
25,000-mile political odyssey with an outdoor rally in San Diego.
   ``I am confident George Bush will get over 300 electors,''
Wirthlin said, ``and on the up side _ add another 80 to that.''
   It takes 270 to win.
   In his speech at an outdoor plaza in San Diego, the same city
where he ended his own two presidential campaigns, Reagan pulled out
the emotional stops in an appeal for California's 47 electoral votes.
   ``This year my name is not on the ballot,'' the 77-year-old
president said. ``And it won't appear on a ballot ever again ...
unless you count the one that someone up there casts when your time
is done and the moment has arrived for His verdict, which, when all
is said and done, is the only election that really counts.
   ``Stand by the Republican ticket, and I don't mind if you stand
by me,'' he said.
   On the way back to Washington, White House Chief of Staff Kenneth
Duberstein told reporters that Reagan was ``feeling real upbeat,
that last speech was very emotional. He's feeling psyched. He feels
he gave it his best shot for George Bush in California.''
   The traveling White House staff threw a party for the president,
with a cake inscribed with the message he had delivered so often
during his 30 campaign stops in 16 states since Labor Day: ``Win one
for the Gipper.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan ate a piece of cake and drank a glass of
champagne.
   ``There is a lot of sentimentality to this journey,'' Wirthlin
told reporters, ``and the thing that makes it so important is that
California is still very close. We show it dead even and it could go
either way.''
   Wirthlin said the Bush campaign asked Reagan to make the trip
``and he was happy to do so.'' He also said Reagan told him it was
the first time he could recall flying to California and back in one
day.
   Fitzwater said the president and his wife, Nancy, would watch the
election returns on television tonight in the family quarters of the
White House. They were expected to be joined by about 20 family
friends and associates in the administration.
   On Wednesday, Duberstein said, Bush is expected to meet with
Reagan at the White House after flying back to Washington from
Houston.
   Reagan spoke outside the Queen Mary Hotel, a converted ocean
liner in Long Beach, before going to his farewell rally in San
Diego. But the San Diego speech was the emotional high point of the
day.
   ``A son of Jack and Nelle Reagan never walked away from a battle
on principle,'' the president said, invoking the memory of his
parents.
   ``This year's election is that kind of fight _ and, by darn,
we're going to win it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Say They Will Seek Talks With New U.S. Adminstration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister and a former
ambassador to the United States say the leftist Sandinista
government will seek negotiations with the new U.S. administration
regardless of who wins today's election.
   ``We hope that they accept what the whole world clearly
understands: the defeat of the war policy and civilized
negotiations,'' Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega said Monday.
   The general, brother of President Daniel Ortega, made the remark
after an army promotion ceremony in Managua.
   ``Facing a new administration, whether it be Democrat or
Republican, Nicaragua's position will be the same: The search for a
negotiated solution,'' former Ambassador Carlos Tunnerman wrote in
Monday's Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper.
   Wilfredo Montalvan, a Contra leader, said the rebels too will
seek a meeting ``to determine if the new government of either Bush
or Dukakis will continue to support the war to defeat once and for
all the Sandinista government.''
   Sandinista leaders say neither Vice President George Bush nor
Gov. Michael Dukakis would be better than President Reagan.
   Washington cut off economic aid to Nicaragua in 1981, declaring
the country a beachhead for communism in Central America and a
threat to U.S. national security. The Reagan administration supports
the Contras, whom the Sandinistas claim are a creation of the United
States.
   There has been no serious contact between Washington and Managua
since early 1985, when the United States broke off direct talks.
   Tunnerman said: ``If Bush wins, he has already said he is
disposed to solicit more military aid for the Contras ... It's
possible that he will not have the same fervor or the same
enthusiasm of Reagan.''
   He said Dukakis' vow to end aid to the Contras ``does not mean he
can dismantle from one day to the other what has been the policy for
eight years.''
   Tunnerman was expelled from the United States in July in response
to Nicaragua's expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton.
   Montalvan, a director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, said the
rebels would reject U.S. military aid if it were provided only to
pressure the Sandinistas into democratic reforms.
   ``We cannot allow our people to continue to sacrifice themselves
just to keep pressure on the Sandinistas,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Miami.
   Most Contras fled Nicaragua for Honduras after U.S. military aid
expired in February. They currently draw on a $27-million
humanitarian aid package approved by the U.S. Congress.
   The Sandinistas and rebels signed a cease-fire pact in March, but
each side accuses the other of violations. Talks on a permanent
truce in the 7-year-old civil war broke down in September.
   The conflict has claimed 26,500 lives, by government count.

<HEAD>Democrats Favored In Indiana And West Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats were favored to retake the governor's office in Indiana
and West Virginia and were locked in tighter-than-ever races with
GOP incumbents in Rhode Island and Utah today as voters in 12 states
cast ballots for their top job.
   Montana also held the possibility that the governor's office
might change party hands, with the candidates in a dead heat to
succeed Democrat Ted Schwinden.
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter, overcoming the stigma of a record $166
million tax increase in 1987, erased an early, 30-point deficit in
the polls to draw even with Democrat Ted Wilson. In Rhode Island,
Bruce Sundlun's allegations of unethical conduct lifted him into a
too-close-to-call race against Gov. Edward DiPrete.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Nine incumbents _ six
Republicans and three Democrats _ are on the ballot. Republican
Robert Orr of Indiana is barred by law from a third term; Schwinden
and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are retiring.
   If Massachussetts' Michael Dukakis is elected president, Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy, also a Democrat, will serve out his gubernatorial
term. In Nevada, Lt. Gov. Bob Miller will succeed fellow Democrat
Dick Bryan if Bryan is elected to the Senate.
   Other states electing governors are Delaware, Missouri, North
Dakota, Vermont and Washington.
   Evan Bayh, son of former U.S. Sen. Birch E. Bayh, was favored to
become Indiana's first Democratic governor office in 20 years,
although his lead appeared to be slipping. The 32-year-old Indiana
secretary of state would also be the youngest U.S. governor in
office.
   An Indianapolis Star poll published Oct. 30 gave him a 54-40 lead
over Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz. But a statewide poll by the
Public Opinion Laboratory at Indiana University-Purdue University at
Indianapolis and released Monday showed likely voters splitting 50.1
percent for Bayh to 46.3 for Mutz. The GOP hoped a big Bush-Quayle
victory in Sen. Dan Quayle's home state would help pull Mutz
through. It was Quayle who ousted the elder Bayh from the Senate in
1980.
   In West Virginia, Republican Arch Moore, seeking an unprecedented
fourth term, fought for his political life. His opponent, Democrat
Gaston Caperton, an insurance executive and political novice, has
called the election a referendum on the economy in West Virginia,
which has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates and had to
borrow $80 million from its investments this year to pay its bills
because of a slump in coal and other industries.
   A poll Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 gave Caperton a 51-35 lead, unchanged
from mid-October, but Moore is a 65-year-old political warhorse who
has made a career overcoming the odds in predominantly Democratic
West Virginia.
   ``People know Arch Moore hasn't delivered and that I will
deliver,'' Caperton said.
   In Rhode Island, Sundlun, a communications executive who lost to
DiPrete by a landslide in 1986, robbed the governor of an early,
commanding lead by raising questions about DiPrete's private
business deals, alleged favoritism in the awarding of state
contracts and the hiring of the ex-wife of a reputed mobster for a
state job. DiPrete has stressed the state's economic recovery.
   Two TV station polls last week had the candidates one point apart.
   The Bangerter campaign in Utah also counted on a strong showing
by Vice President George Bush. The governor's comeback largely
coincided with Bush's surge since the Republican National Convention
in August. The outcome may also hinge on whether independent Merrill
Cook, who ran on a tax-limitation platform, can hold the support of
conservatives.
   Two polls issued Sunday had Wilson, the former mayor of Salt Lake
City, 2 points ahead of Bangerter with 37 percent, and even with the
governor at 36 percent. Cook had 26 percent and 24 percent.
   ``It's always scary to see those polls drop, but 15 months ago,
when we led by 30, we knew there was no way we could win by more
than 4 points,'' said Wilson campaign manager Rob Jolley.
   Montana's Thomas Judge, Democratic governor from 1973 to 1981,
and Republican state Sen. Stan Stephens claimed late momentum in a
campaign over how to revive the state's economy. A poll late last
month indicated a dead heat.
   Neither side expected much of a coattail effect from the White
House race; ticket-splitting Montana has sided with the GOP
presidential winner for 20 years, but its governor, both senators
and one of two congressmen are Democrats.
   In other races:
   DELAWARE _ Republican Gov. Michael N. Castle was expected to roll
toward an overwhelming victory against Democrat Jacob Kreshtool, a
retired attorney and political newcomer.
   MISSOURI _ Republican Gov. John Ashcroft headed for an expected
landslide against Democratic state Rep. Betty Hearnes, wife of a
former governor.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Judd Gregg, a congressman and son of a
former governor, was favored over Paul McEachern, a fierce opponent
of the Seabrook nuclear plant who nearly rode the issue into the
Statehouse two years ago.
   NORTH CAROLINA _ Republican Gov. Jim Martin led Lt. Gov. Bob
Jordan, a Democrat.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Gov. George Sinner held a commanding lead in the
polls over Republican Leon Mallberg, a businessman making his first
run for statewide office.
   VERMONT _ Democrat Madeleine Kunin, the state's first woman
governor, was favored for a third term against House GOP Leader
Michael Bernhardt.
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic Gov. Booth Gardner headed for an expected
landslide over Republican state Rep. Bob Williams.

   Republican George Bush offered a reprise of his
speeches and television ads and Democrat Michael Dukakis confessed
that ``I don't wear my heart on my sleeve,'' as the presidential
candidates took their final shots at the living-room audience.
   The candidates' half-hour television programs Monday night were
as different and typical as their campaigns.
   Dukakis subjected himself to blunt and unflattering questions
from well-meaning people all around the country, while Bush
presented a highly polished documentary that drew extensively on his
convention acceptance speech and several commercials dropped
virtually unedited into the program.
   Dukakis showcased his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, along
with the citizen-questioners and a few scenes with his family. Bush
featured his wife, his children, his grandchildren, police chiefs,
Charlton Heston and President Reagan. Even his media adviser, Roger
Ailes, had an off-screen speaking part. But there was no mention of
Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, considered a drag on the
ticket.
   Within the first few seconds of his program, Dukakis was shown
both in shirtsleeves at a town meeting and in a book-lined room
wearing a red pullover sweater. He later appeared playing the
trumpet, dancing with his wife and doing an imitation of a radio
broadcaster who wrongly announced that Dewey had defeated Truman.
   ``Maybe I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, but my passion is in
my service to the public,'' said the Massachusetts governor,
explaining himself to a questioner who asked why he didn't show
emotion.
   Dukakis also defended himself against many of the issues raised
by Bush, including his crime record and his military policy. If
elected, he told one questioner, ``you can bet your life... that
this nation will be defended and defended well.''
   Surrounded by his family, he pledged to be ``a fine president, a
good leader, and somebody you can be proud of.''
   Bush, with background music and rhetoric echoing Reagan's
campaigns, vowed that ``if you elect me president, you will be
better off four years from now than you are today.'' He also said he
had the experience ``to be a steady hand guiding our country.''
   While the tone of the programs was not harsh, the candidates did
not refrain from criticizing each other.
   The vice president, in an excerpt from his acceptance speech,
attacked Dukakis for opposing the death penalty, school prayer and a
Massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to lead the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   Elsewhere in the broadcast Bush reiterated his criticism of the
Massachusetts prison furlough program. And he said Dukakis ``has no
experience in national security affairs. I don't believe we can take
a risk on an issue as important as our national security.''
   Dukakis attacked Republican agricultural policy and charged that
the GOP would balance the budget by cutting Social Security. And he
belittled what he called ``the only new idea George Bush has had
since this campaign began _ a new $40 billion, five-year capital
gains tax giveaway for the very rich.''
   ``Now who is going to pay for that tax break?'' Dukakis demanded
of an enthusiastic audience at a rally. ``Look beside you. Look
behind you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself, is George Bush on
your side?''
   It was left to Bentsen to complain about Bush's hardball media
strategy. ``The people of Texas have been outraged by the
distortions the Republicans have made with their commercial TV,'' he
said. And he contended that voters are also ``deeply concerned''
about the choice of Quayle.

<HEAD>Dead Colonel's Last Meal To Be Examined, Maid And Gardener
Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An opposition political leader says
it does not matter whether Col. Jean-Claude Paul, a powerful figure
in Haiti's army, was murdered or died a natural death.
   ``The Haitian people have one less enemy,'' the opposition
leader, Sylvio Claude, said Monday, a day after Paul died under
suspicious circumstances. ``A Macoute, a killer, he personally
wanted to eliminate me.''
   Paul had been linked to the hated Tonton Macoutes, private
security force of the deposed Duvalier regime, and was indicted this
year on U.S. drug charges.
   Two weeks after a coup led by noncommissioned officers installed
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as president, Paul was forcibly retired as
head of Haiti's of most brutal army unit, the Dessalines Battalion.
   The leaders of the Sept. 17 coup demanded democratic reforms and
an end to state-sponsored violence.
   ``Whether the cause of death is natural or unnatural, the
political consequences of his demise are important,'' Claude said.
``Avril has gained in the loss of a potential rival, and he should
feel more secure.''
   Paul's brother, Antonio, told Radio Haiti-Inter that the colonel
died in his arms after eating a bowl of soup at his suburban home.
   Authorities were investigated that last meal as well as Paul's
maid and gardener, a family friend said.
   Radio Haiti-Inter, which first reported Paul's death was the
result of a heart attack, said Monday that Paul was seen earlier
Sunday in good health and that police consider the death suspicious.
   The family friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, speculated
the 49-year-old colonel was poisoned.
   He said the maid and gardener at the home were detained Sunday at
Petionville police station Sunday for questioning. They were not
identified.
   Paul's former wife, Mireille Delinois, also was taken to the
Petionville station Sunday and given police protection for fear of
reprisal from Paul's relatives, the friend said.
   Haiti-Inter, an independent station, said Ms. Delinois had been
detained but gave no details. She and Paul had been married twice
and divorced twice.
   Police and government officials declined comment. By Haitian law
a person can be detained for up to 48 hours without charges being
filed.
   Haiti-Inter also said the leftovers of the meal Paul had Sunday
would be sent to Miami for analysis.
   Antonio Paul said his brother felt sick after eating soup and
died in his arms shortly after lunch. He did not say whether he
thought Paul was poisoned.
   There were different reports about an autopsy.
   Haiti-Inter said an autopsy was performed Monday, but it did not
report the results. Radio Soleil reported the family said the
autopsy was to be performed by military coroners, but the family had
not been permitted to select the person to conduct the examination.
   Avril fired Paul on Sept. 30 in a purge of commanders who served
under Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who was deposed in the coup after
running Haiti since Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France
in February 1986.
   Paul had commanded the 700-man Dessalines Batallion, the most
brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, and had been linked to the
Tonton Macoutes, the dreaded private security force of the 29-year
Duvalier dictatorship.
   Under Namphy, many former Macoutes were integrated as special
agents into Paul's unit. Avril has pledged to disband the
Dessalines, but has set no timetable.
   In March, Paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. The
United States and Haiti have no extradition treaty.

<HEAD>238 Ballot Questions Include Gun Control, Car Insurance And
Abortions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN STEINBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters today were deciding bans on cheap guns in Maryland and
state-funded abortions in Michigan. Measures in California aimed at
curbing car insurance rates resulted in the nation's most expensive
contest outside who occupies the White House.
   The 238 ballot questions facing voters in 41 states also included
proposals dealing with AIDS testing, smoking, nuclear power,
homosexual rights, lotteries, and even the treatment of animals.
   California voters faced the most statewide propositions, 29, on
which a record $130 million, or more than $9 per voter, was spent.
   Supporters and foes of five proposals aimed at cutting car
insurance rates poured in more than $75 million, making it the most
expensive campaign in the country outside a presidential race.
Insurers alone spent $60 million, hoping to stop what they fear
could be the start of a nationwide ``insurance revolt.''
   An AIDS testing measure would among other things end California's
anonymous screening program and require officials to trace the
contacts of anyone testing positive for the virus.
   The measure was promoted by Paul Gann, who contracted AIDS in
1982 from a blood transfusion and was co-author a decade ago of the
landmark tax-cutting Proposition 13 and backed by Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian. On Saturday, a group representing 500 health care
professionals vowed to defy the measure.
   In Maryland, the National Rifle Association pumped more than $4
million into its bid to repeal a 6-month-old law that outlaws cheap
handguns. Opponents and advocates agreed that the vote could
influence the fate of similar statutes pending in the New Jersey and
Florida legislatures. Polls projected a close race.
   Voters in Michigan decided whether to ban state-funded abortions
for poor women except to save the mother's life. Anti-abortion
groups spent $3 million and pro-choice groups raised $1.2 million on
the campaign.
   A proposed Arkansas amendment would ban tax-financed abortions
and protect life from conception, and Colorado voters decided
whether to repeal a similar measure. Michigan, however, was seen as
the most important test, in part because of the diversity of its
population and the amount spent.
   In other issues:
   SMOKING _ Oregon voters decided whether to toughen the state's
already strict anti-smoking ordinance with a measure that would ban
smoking in most public places. Californians decided whether to boost
the cigarette tax from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack and use proceeds
to promote health.
   ENVIRONMENT _ Massachusetts voters decided whether to effectively
shut down its two nuclear power plants. Nebraskans considered
whether to become the first state to pull out of an interstate
nuclear waste disposal compact.
   In Kentucky, the coal industry fought a proposed amendment
limiting the right to strip mining. A South Dakota measure would
require strip miners to restore land to original contours where
possible.
   Environmental groups backed a proposal that would give Washington
state unilateral authority to order hazardous waste sites cleaned
up, impose stiff fines and pursue criminal sanctions against
polluters who balk. A rival initiative backed by the business
community and most legislators would allow corporations time to
negotiate.
   Montanans decided whether to become the tenth state to mandate
return deposits on beverage containers.
   HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS _ An Oregon initiative would revoke Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt's year-old order forbidding discrimination against state
employees because of sexual orientation. Fort Collins, Colo., voters
decided whether to affirm homosexual rights.
   GAMBLING _ Kentucky, Idaho and Minnesota voters considered state
lotteries. Indianans considered a lottery and parimutuel betting. In
South Dakota, voters decided whether to allow gambling in Deadwood,
the town where Wild Bill Hickok was shot 112 years ago while playing
poker.
   ANIMAL RIGHTS _ Massachusetts voters considered a measure to
ensure that farm animals were protected from cruelty.
   TAXES _ A Colorado amendment seeking to reduce income and
property taxes could cut state revenues by $700 million. South
Dakota and Utah voters also decided tax-limiting measures. In
Arkansas, the ``Fair Tax Amendment'' supported by Gov. Bill Clinton
would make it easier for the Legislature to increase the income tax.
   ENGLISH _ Florida, Arizona and Colorado voters decided whether to
declare English their states' official language.
   SEAT BELTS _ Montanans voted whether to repeal a year-old law
requiring motorists and passengers to wear seat belts. Oregon voters
decided whether to approve a new seat belt law.
   HIGHWAYS _ New York Gov. Mario Cuomo strongly backed borrowing a
proposed record $3 billion to fix roads and bridges.
   WAGES AND BENEFITS _ A Massachusetts referendum sought to repeal
the state's 74-year old ``prevailing wage'' law requiring
communities to pay union wages and benefits on public projects. In
California, a proposition would require restoration of funds for the
California Occupational Safety and Health Agency, which was
dismantled by Deukmejian last year.
   TORT REFORM _ Florida residents considered a proposed
constitutional amendment to limit damages for bodily injury claims
to $100,000 for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering or
mental anguish.

   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, exhorting California supporters on Election eve:
``Don't let them tell you this campaign is over. It won't be over
until the people of California have their say. ... I know this race
is within our grasp both here and across this country.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, at his St. Louis, Mo. campaign headquarters: ``I
feel good, but we're not going to let up until we finish tonight.
... It's in the hands of the gods and the American people.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, at home in Indiana for his final rally of the
campaign: ``For the last 10 weeks, I've felt like I've been strapped
to the back of an Indy 500 car. But now I can see the checkered
flag, and with your help my friends, George Bush and I will be
seeing you in the winner's circle.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, summing up his vision of the United States at
campaign's end: ``America is not just a place. It's not just a piece
of land or just another country. It's the noblest experiment ever
undertaken on this planet. It's a symbol of what we human beings can
do when we unleash the will of our people, our nation and our
country.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, using lines from a Bruce Springsteen song to sum
up his defiance of discouraging polls: ``No retreat, baby. No
surrender.''
   
   PRESIDENT REAGAN, at his final election rally as president:
``This year my name is not on the ballot. And it won't appear on a
ballot ever again ... unless you count the one that someone up there
casts when your time is done and the moment has arrived for His
verdict, which, when all is said and done, is the only election that
really counts.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's top law and order official
resigned after a Greek-American banker indicted in a $30-million
scandal escaped police surveillance and fled the country.
   Opposition conservatives immediately demanded the resignation of
Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government, claiming George
Koskotas was permitted to escape so he would not implicate top
government officials in allegedly illegal financial deals.
   Koskotas, 34, fled Sunday, apparently by yacht, said a police
officer.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officer said Koskotas
sailed from the village of Megalo Pefko, 20 miles from Athens, and
his whereabouts were unknown.
   Public Order Minister Tassos Sehiotis, whose ministry was
responsible for police surveillance of Koskotas, said he submitted
his resignation Monday ``since such omissions ... create an issue of
political sensitivity.''
   He said a warrant has been issued for Koskotas' arrest.
   One week ago, the banker was banned from leaving Greece while
officials investigated alleged financial irregularities at the Bank
of Crete, which he had controlled.
   Greek newspapers' have charged that senior socialist officials
have been involved in illegal deals set up by Koskotas.
   ``The Greek people are left with the conviction that George
Koskotas was spirited away so that he would not speak. The
responsibility goes all the way to the top of the government
pyramid,'' said Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the main
opposition New Democracy party. He demanded the government resign.
   The government last week pledged to uncover the scandal and
warned there would be no pardons for members of the governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement who may be implicated.
   Critics also have lambasted the government for permitting
Koskotas to build a multimillion dollar banking and media empire
without adequately checking his financial background.
   Koskotas was suspended Oct. 20 as Bank of Crete chairman and
indicted on five counts of forgery and embezzlement. He was given
until Nov. 14 to prepare his defense.
   Koskotas, who holds both American and Greek citizenship, bought a
controlling interest in the Bank of Crete in 1984 after working in
its central Athens branch for six years as an accountant.
   Rival newspapers claim Koskotas illegally used Bank of Crete
money to finance his publishing group Grammi, which controls three
daily newspapers, five magazines and a radio station.
   Last weekend, shipowner Aristides Alafouzos paid $6.3 million for
the most presitigious Grammi title, the conservative daily
Kathimerini.
   Koskotas' parents, brother, wife and five children all have left
Greece during the past week.
   The banker grew up in the United States. In 1975, he was fined
$200 in New York for falsifying college letterheads.
   In October 1987, he was arrested in Washington D.C. for alleged
social security fraud but was allowed to return to Greece after
posting $1 million bond. That case attracted wide publicity in
Athens. But the government ignored calls for a thorough
investigation of Koskotas' affairs.

<HEAD>TV Interview Reunites Holocaust Survivors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Robert Kahn listened to a Holocaust survivor
tell his story on television, he suddenly had a flash of
recognition. The man on the screen, he realized, was a boyhood chum
he hadn't seen in 50 years.
   Ernest Michel's face wasn't familiar, Kahn said, but the name
rang a bell. And when Michel told the ``CBS Morning News''
interviewer Monday he had grown up in Mannheim, Germany, ``it all
came back,'' Kahn said.
   Michel, executive vice president of the United Jewish Appeal
Federation of New York, was appearing on the program to discuss the
50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night when Nazis went on a
rampage against Jews in Germany.
   As Kahn watched from his home in Dayton, Ohio, he said he
realized that Michel was a boyhood friend who had attended the same
synagogue in Mannheim. The two hadn't seen each other at least since
autumn 1938.
   Kahn fled Germany with his parents in early 1939; Michel stayed
and spent the war in labor and concentration camps, where almost all
his family died.
   ``My young friends, most of them perished as far as I know,''
Kahn, a retired Air Force civilian employee, said in a telephone
interview from Dayton. ``So I was delighted to find out that here,
in New York, was a former boyhood friend.''
   The two, who were 15 in 1938 and are 65 today, spoke by telephone
Monday evening, quickly catching up on the intervening years.
   ``It's real _ we really know each other!'' Michel exulted. ``We
traded stamps, we played soccer together. ... It's one of those
incredible stories!''
   ``The excitement is not based on really having been close and
longtime friends,'' Kahn said. ``The excitement is that there is
someone left whom I associated with. It has a tremendous meaning.''
   Michel said the two boys had dated two sisters, who now live in
Florida. Those were the only surviving boyhood friends Michel was
aware of; Kahn didn't realize the sisters were alive but knew of two
other friends now living in the United States.
   ``We're going to get together as soon as we can work it out,''
said Michel.
   ``I'm sure he wouldn't recognize me,'' said Kahn. ``I have white
hair and I notice he has white hair, and we've put on a few pounds
here and there.''

   Residents of Dixville Notch followed
tradition by becoming the first voters of the 1988 presidential
election today and favored Republican George Bush over Democrat
Michael Dukakis by 34-3.
   The town's 28 registered Republicans, six Democrats and four
independents came out in snowy, windy weather to carry on the
tradition of casting the nation's first votes just after midnight.
One voter broke with the nominees and wrote in GOP Rep. Jack Kemp of
New York.
   Town officials tallied the results immediately after the last
ballot was placed in the box in a room at the Balsams resort.
   Located in extreme northern New Hampshire, Dixville Notch
incorporated only for the purposes of voting and has been casting
the first ballots since the early 1970s.
   More often than not, Dixville Notch has not been a bellwether for
the nation, although the town voted 29-1 for Ronald Reagan over
Walter Mondale in 1984.

<HEAD>Women Thanks Judge For His Six Month Sentence In Hijacking Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who said her former husband
terrorized her into helping him hijack a jetliner to Cuba nearly 20
years ago thanked the judge who sentenced her to six months in jail.
   Linda Joyce Grinage, 39, will have to serve only 32 more days
because she was credited with time served at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in New York. After her release she will be on
probation for five years.
   ``I think you earned it,'' U.S. District Court Judge Jacob
Mishler said of her sentence. ``I hope you prove it.''
   Mrs. Grinage had been living in the Albany area for about 10
years under the name Haziine Eytina, with her second husband, Mylo
Eytina, and five children. She was arrested in July after the FBI
received an anonymous tip.
   ``Over the last 20 years, I have suffered greatly,'' she told the
judge. ``I've been forced to abandon my two children by my first
marriage and I've been forced to live a double life with my husband
and five children.
   ``I'm now an honest, hardworking woman.''
   Mrs. Grinage, a preschool aide the past five years, pleaded
guilty to a charge of interfering with the crew of a Miami-bound
Eastern Airlines jet from New York. She could have been sentenced to
a maximum 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine for the plea.
   Charges of air piracy and interference with a flight crew with a
deadly weapon, for which she could have been sentenced to life in
prison, were dropped.
   She admitted helping her first husband, Tyrone Ellington Austin,
hijack the plane on Jan. 2, 1969, by taking a 2-year-old boy hostage
at gunpoint.
   In a tearful plea for leniency at her sentencing Monday, Grinage
expressed remorse for holding a gun to the boy's head, and said she
understands how his mother feels.
   ``I realize I endangered the lives of innocent people and I
frightened them,'' she said.
   The child, his mother and the other 146 people on board were
freed unharmed when jetliner landed in Havana.
   But Mrs. Grinage also claimed Austin had beaten and terrorized
her into cooperating with him.
   ``I knew what my husband had planned,'' Mrs. Grinage said. ``I
was terrified of my husband. If he told me to walk off the side of a
building I would have done so.''
   She and Austin lived in Cuba for an unknown period of time.
   Austin was killed by New York City police in a shoot-out in 1971
following a bank robbery.

<TEXT>
   Radio Moscow said today that the Soviets will try
again in the next few days to launch their space shuttle, whose
maiden voyage was scrubbed last month by a last-minute technical
malfunction.
   The state-run radio, in a news broadcast, said the shuttle
orbiter Buran (Snowstorm) and booster rocket Energia are in launch
position at the Baikonur space center on the steppes of Soviet
Kazakhstan.
   ``Their launch and test flight are to take place in the next few
days,'' the radio said, without giving a definite date.
   An earlier attempt to send the Buran on what is to be an unmanned
mission was aborted just 51 seconds before blastoff on Oct. 29 when
a fault appeared in ground equipment. A computer sensed that an
equipment platform had not pulled far enough away from the Energia,
and automatically stopped the countdown.

<HEAD>Attorney: Wandering Ship Has Dumped Its Unwanted Ash Load</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ship that spent more than two years
searching for a place to leave thousands of tons of city incinerator
ash finally disposed of the cargo after rejection by at least seven
countries, an attorney says.
   Bruce Phillips, representing a company hired by the city to get
rid of the waste, said Monday he received a document last week
saying the ash has been disposed of, but not where or when.
   Phillips, who represents Joseph Paolino & Sons Inc., said the
document was sent as a fax from Romo Shipping Corp., which he
believes is the ship's owner, to Amalgamated Shipping Co., the
vessel's former owner.
   The ship underwent repairs in Yugoslavia in August. It is
believed the ownership of the Khian Sea changed hands and that the
ship was renamed the Felicia, said Jim Vallette, a spokesman for the
environmental group Greenpeace.
   Vallette said the international organization believes the ash,
estimated at 10,000 to nearly 15,000 tons, was dumped in the
vicinity of the Indian Ocean.
   Vallette said the ship unsuccessfully attempted to dispose of the
ash in Sri Lanka in mid-October.
   ``Over the past three weeks, we've sent notices to every country
bordering the Indian Ocean warning them of the cargo'' the ship is
carrying, he said.
   Vallette said Phillips received the copy of the document
Thursday, indicating the ash was dumped before then.
   Phillips would not say when or how he received the copy.
   He said he is preparing a motion arguing that Romo, Amalgamated
and others are in civil contempt for defying an injunction filed
June 2. Phillips said the injunction prohibits dumping or disposing
the ash without notifying his client of a plan in advance.
   ``It's aggravating because it is already a fait accompli,'' the
lawyer said of the disposal.
   Joseph Paolino & Sons cannot receive payment from the city unless
it can show the ash has been disposed of in ``an environmentally
sound manner,'' Phillips said.
   The ship began its journey Sept. 5, 1986, with 15,000 tons of
incinerated Philadelphia trash, and has traveled to Central America,
South America and the Mideast in search of a place to dispose of it.
   The ship unloaded about 3,000 tons of the cargo in Haiti before
leaving under government orders last February. Haiti ordered the
cargo returned to the ship before it left, but an undetermined
amount was left behind.
   Efforts to dispose of the ash in the Bahamas, the Dominican
Republic, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde
Islands also proved unsuccessful.
   Vallette said Greenpeace could not determine where Romo is
located, although he said it is believed to be a Middle Eastern
company, possibly Egyptian.
   Although Greenpeace has labeled the ship's cargo toxic, the state
found no problems with the ash when it was originally loaded. Tests
by the state Department of Environmental Resources and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency while the ship waited fruitlessly in
the Delaware Bay to return to Philadelphia also found it to be safe.
   The ship's journey recalls the five-month odyssey last year of a
garbage barge carrying 3,100 tons of trash from Islip, N.Y. The
barge was spurned by Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, Mexico,
Belize and the Bahamas before returning to New York and dumping the
trash in Brooklyn.

   An American convicted in Spain of carrying
cocaine into that country could be out of prison shortly now that he
has been returned to the United States.
   Conan Owen, 24, of Annandale, Va., a freelance photographer who
once worked for Vice President George Bush, is scheduled to appear
before two U.S. Parole Commission hearing examiners the week of Nov.
21. He is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center
in New York and is to be moved in several weeks to a
minimum-security federal prison facility in the Washington area.
   Last April, 13 months after his arrest in Barcelona, Owen was
sentenced to six years in prison after being convicted of taking
four pounds of cocaine into Spain from Chile in a false-bottom
suitcase.
   Owen says he was asked by an acquaintance to deliver the suitcase
to Spain, and that he was unaware that it contained cocaine.
   He was returned Monday to the United States under the terms of a
1983 treaty that provides for the transfer of prisoners between the
United States and Spain when a citizen of one country is convicted
of a crime in the other.
   At Kennedy Airport in New York, Owen had an emotional reunion
with his parents, Raquel and Ernest Owen.
   ``I feel good, a lot better, but I'm not home yet,'' Owen said
after hugging his parents before a crush of reporters.
   Family members said they hoped to have Owen home by Thanksgiving,
if only on a holiday furlough.
   ``We've gotten this far, thank God, (but) uncertainty goes before
us,'' said Ernest Owen. ``We want him to be able to get on with his
life. There is no question that his name will be cleared.''
   The Justice Department said in a statement that once the U.S.
Parole Commission determines a release date, the Bureau of Prisons
has the flexibility to place Owen in a community-based facility. The
bureau could consider placement in a house arrest program under the
supervision of Sheriff Wayne Huggins of Fairfax County, Va., Owen's
home area, the department said.
   Owen, who was arrested in Barcelona on March 13, 1987, said he
had been in Chile shooting travel brochure photographs on an
assignment arranged by Jorge Barahona of Washington, D.C. As part of
a plea-bargain deal with U.S. officials, Barahona subsequently told
a federal judge that Owen knew nothing about the drugs and had been
set up to carry the suitcase.
   The Spanish government agreed to Owen's request for a transfer to
a U.S. prison Oct. 28. To obtain the transfer, Owen had to agree not
to appeal his conviction.
   Owen worked as a 1984 summer intern in Bush's office and had been
admitted to the U.S. Army Intelligence School at Fort Huachuca, Ariz.

   A car bomb exploded near a Syrian
checkpoint in Moslem west Beirut shortly after midnight today,
wounding three Syrian soldiers and a Palestinian guerrilla leader,
police said.
   The explosive-packed car blew up near the southern entrance to
the Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp.
   The Palestinian group Fatah-Uprising, headed by Col. Saeed Mousa,
or Abu Mousa, said in a statement released overnight the blast was
an attempt to assassinate its secretary-general, Abu Fadi Hammad.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombing. Abu Mousa,
backed by Syria, is struggling with Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat for control of Palestinian
refugee camps in Lebanon.
   The statement said the bomb-laden car was detonated by remote
control as Hammad was driving in a different vehicle across the
Syrian checkpoint near the camp. He suffered serious wounds.
   There was no word on the condition of the wounded Syrians, who
were at the checkpoint.
   It was the 17th car bombing in Lebanon this year. By police
count, 115 people were killed and 272 wounded in the previous
bombings since April 23.

   Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos called
for the U.S. government to respect ``our right to our dignity'' as
she returned to her Hawaii exile from New York where she pleaded
innocent to racketeering charges.
   ``I've just come back from the most harrowing and most inhuman
experience of my life,'' Mrs. Marcos told reporters and about two
dozen supporters after her arrival Monday night at Honolulu
International Airport.
   Later, when she arrived at the couple's hillside estate, her
husband, deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, stood up
from his wheelchair briefly and kissed her. He also was wearing a
neck brace.
   Marcos has been in a wheelchair but without a neck brace during
his few public appearances since the indictments were returned last
month.
   The Marcoses are accused in federal indictments of plundering
$103 million from the Philippine treasury, funneling it to foreign
bank accounts and using it to buy prime New York City real estate
and art.
   Mrs. Marcos was allowed to return to Hawaii after posting a $5
million bond. Marcos, 71, remained in Hawaii after lawyers argued he
was too ill to make the trip to New York for arraignment.
   ``I now pray ... you (the U.S. government) will honor the
territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines, a Third
World country, respect our constitution and our laws and above all,
give every human being our right to our dignity,'' she said.
   Sobbing, she said, ``God bless America. God Bless the
Philippines,'' and got into a limousine to go to the Marcoses'
hillside estate overlooking Honolulu, where they have lived since
1986.
   She arrived aboard a jet owned by tobacco heiress Doris Duke, a
long-time friend who also arranged her $5 million bond.
   The Marcoses are to appear before FBI agents in Honolulu on
Wednesday to give fingerprints, palm prints, and voice and
handwriting samples under a court order issued in New York.
   Two federal prosecutors from New York are in the Philippines to
gather evidence in the case against the Marcoses, the U.S. Embassy
in Manila said today. The government-run Philippines News Agency
said the prosecutors also would interview prospective witnesses
against Marcoses.
   In addition to the U.S. indictment, Philippine President Corazon
Aquino's government has accused Marcos and his associates of
embezzling up to $10 billion before a February 1986 uprising toppled
his 20-year administration and forced him into exile in Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   A witness in former Miss America Bess Myerson's
divorce-fixing trial denied prosecution allegations that the
one-time cultural affairs commissioner tried to buy him off with the
prospect of a job.
   ``I explained it to those guys (federal prosecutors) there. It's
a joke, a longstanding joke between us,'' Walter Canter said in a
telephone interview Monday evening.
   ``Believe me, it's a non-story.''
   Canter, a former journalist who worked as a speechwriter for Miss
Myerson for 15 years, testified Monday that she fired him in 1983
from his job at the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
   He said he had not heard from her until two or three weeks ago,
when she telephoned him.
   Defense lawyers immediately objected, and U.S. District Judge
John Keenan conferred privately with prosecutors and defense lawyers
before barring any further testimony about the call.
   According to a transcript released later, Assistant U.S. Attorney
told Keenan that Miss Myerson told Canter ``that she was thinking of
starting a foundation and that she thought he would be a good person
to head the foundation.''
   ``Is there anything more?'' the judge asked. ``Is it that the
inference is to be drawn that she was trying to buy him off by
offering him something at a foundation?''
   ``I think that is a fair inference,'' Abrams said, adding that
Canter ``sort of made light of it ... he essentially sloughed it
off.''
   ``I think it's an ambiguous conversation,'' said Miss Myerson's
attorney, Frederick Hafetz.
   Carter said Monday night that Miss Myerson ``was trying to have
her sense of humor come out. That is something, when you are between
a rock and a hard place, to have your sense of humor.''
   The lawyers and defendants have been ordered by the judge not to
discuss the case outside court.
   Miss Myerson, 64, is on trial with her lover, Carl ``Andy''
Capasso, 43, and former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel,
75, who made rulings in Capasso's divorce.
   Miss Myerson is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to
Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet, to influence the judge's decision
in the divorce case.
   The judge's daughter was hired in August 1983. Less than a month
later, Mrs. Gabel cut Capasso's temporary alimony and child support
payments to his estranged wife.
   Canter testified Monday that he had rewritten a resume for Miss
Gabel. He said he had written speeches and ghostwritten magazine
articles for Miss Myerson from 1968 to 1983.
   He said that when he went with Miss Myerson to the cultural
affairs agency, he did not have to go through a city interview
process, his resume was not submitted for review and he did not have
the qualifications required for the job title he operated under.
   ``I wasn't aware of titles,'' Canter testified.
   ``Miss Myerson was familiar with my background and the work I had
done,'' he added. ``I knew what I had been brought in to do and I
did it.''
   Testimony is scheduled to resume Wednesday.

<HEAD>Leftists Claim Assassination Attempt On South Lebanon Army Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of Syrian-backed leftist
militias claimed responsibility today for an attempt to assassinate
Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army.
   Beirut newspapers published the Lebanese National Resistance
Front's claim the day after a woman shot and wounded Lahd at his
home in Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   Lahd's troops caught the attacker and were questioning her and
the army commander was flown by helicopter to an Israeli hospital in
Haifa, where a spokesman said he was in stable condition today.
   Zvi Ben-Ishai of Rambam Hospital told army radio that surgeons
operated on Lahd's right arm and upper chest.
   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of Israel's northern command, called the
assassination attempt ``a serious incident.''
   Israeli media said Israeli army intelligence suspected the
assailant, Soha Fawaz Bishara, was paid by a guerrilla organization.
   The Lebanese National Resistance Front statement identified
Bishara, 21, as a Christian from the south Lebanon village of Deir
Mimas, which is inside the security zone.
   It said she was a member of the Lebanese Communist Party from
1982 until 1987, when she joined the Lebanese National Resistance
Front. The front, which cuts across religious lines, includes the
Communists.
   The statement said the attempt on Lahd's life supports the
11-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza strip.
   There were no other claims of responsibility. Lahd and his
militia have been the target of Palestinian guerrillas, pro-Syrian
leftist and Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem factions all trying to
drive Israel from the zone.
   Israel carved the zone six to 10 miles deep when most Israeli
troops were withdrawn from Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year
occupation.
   Voice of the South, radio of the South Lebanon Army, said Bishara
works at a health club patronized by Lahd's wife, Minerva, who had
invited her for tea.
   When Lahd, 61, arrived at his home in Marjayoun town Monday
night, Bishara shot him twice in the shoulder, the radio said.
Marjayoun is four miles north of the Israeli border.
   Lahd, a Maronite and retired officer of Lebanon's regular army,
took over his command in September 1984, after his predecessor died
of cancer.
   His predominantly Christian force of 2,000 troops patrols the
zone with about 1,000 Israeli soldiers. The militia has been allied
with Israel for about 12 years.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen ended a final, marathon
campaign swing in his home state today, still defiant of polls
showing the Democratic ticket trailing.
   More than a hundred supporters greeted him at the Austin airport
for a welcome home ceremony that featured sparklers, a spotlight
entrance, and a Buddy Holly tune.
   To the end, as he stumped through Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and
Missouri on election eve, he insisted the polls were turning around
and that he and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
would win.
   He raced through eight cities in 19 hours, finally winding up a
day of virtually continuous campaigning with the upbeat rally at 3
a.m. EST.
   ``No retreat, baby. No surrender,'' vowed the 67-year-old
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, quoting a song by rock and
roll star Bruce Springsteen.
   Bentsen was to spend election evening in Austin, visiting with
campaign workers and then waiting for the results in his hotel room.
The Democratic celebration was being held in the Driskill Hotel,
where Lyndon Johnson spent election eve in 1960.
   Also like LBJ, Bentsen was on the ballot today for re-election to
his Senate seat. Under Texas law, he can run for both offices and he
has promised to resign the Senate if he wins the vice presidency.
   Polls released just prior to Election Day indicated the ticket
was still trailing Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle, although
the gap narrowed to just a few points.
   Dukakis was campaigning around the clock and Bentsen wasn't far
behind. His day started at about 7 a.m. Monday and didn't end until
past 2 a.m. CST Tuesday. He hit eight cities, five in Texas and one
each in Arkansas, Louisiana and Missouri.
   In Kansas City, his last major campaign stop, several hundred
supporters jammed into a hotel ballroom when he spoke at nearly
midnight.
   ``The momentum is with us, it's going our way,'' he told them.
   The final message was simple.
   ``We're on your side, and they're not,'' he repeated at every
stop, echoing Dukakis' class-conscious argument that the Democrats
care more about middle-income needs such as health care, housing,
and Social Security. Republican negative advertising was distorting
that message, he said.
   In Houston, where a crowd of 3,000 greeted him, Bentsen said he
could ``remember how Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson carried
Texas.'' Surrounded by family and political allies, he asserted,
``We carry Texas and we carry it all.''
   Late in the day, Bentsen added to his stump speech the
Springsteen line. Reporters asked afterward if he were a Springsteen
fan.
   ``I am now,'' he replied, upbeat despite the grueling schedule.
``You bet, baby.''
   Bentsen's wife, B.A., quickly grabbed him by the mouth, cutting
short any further explanation.

<HEAD>Student Join Rebel Fight Against Burmese Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAE TAH WAW, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Karen guerrillas, joined by
students who fled government repression in major cities, today
battled Burmese troops trying to retake this base near the Thai
border, guerrilla commanders said.
   The students, numbering about 130, recently joined the guerrillas
in front-line fighting for the first time, said the commanders, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The rebel leaders said the students received four weeks of
military training from the ethnic minority Karens, who have for four
decades been waging a war for greater autonomy.
   More than 5,000 students and other protestors fled to the Karens
after a military coup Sept. 18 and a ruthless suppression of a
``people's power'' uprising in which more than 450 people died.
   The students, along with as many as 1,000 guerrillas of the Karen
National Union, are trying to beat back Burmese reinforcements
attempting to retake several hills around the camp, the guerrilla
commanders said.
   Mae Tah Waw is on a key Karen transport and communications route,
where the Karens tax the massive smuggling trade between Thailand
and Burma that includes gems, consumer items, antiques, livestock
and teak.
   The battle for Mae Tah Waw began in early October when the Karens
launched attacks against the encampment and a series of surrounding
hills that the Burmese army captured in 1984.
   The camp, located on the Moei River about 80 miles north of the
key Thai border town of Mae Sot, had until then been inhabited by an
unknown number of Karen civilians and guerrillas.
   The Karens seized the Burmese base and three hills in the third
week of October and were attempting to dislodge remnants from a
fourth when, according to President Bo Mya of the Karen National
Union, the Burmese moved in 10 battalions of reinforcements in
recent days.
   The Burmese force, strung out westward into thickly jungled
country, is estimated at 2,000 to 3,000.
   Most of the 130 students were reported counter-attacking the
reinforcements.
   ``We need more weapons,'' operation commander Gen. Hla Thoo told
reporters. He said the students would relieve Karen guerrillas and
use their rifles since there were not enough to go around.
   In recent days, the Karens have been ferrying in their own
reinforcements on motor launches along the Moei River, which forms
the border between Thailand and Burma here.
   The students have vowed to wage war against the Rangoon
government, which sent troops into the streets of Burma's cities to
gun down demonstrators and put an end to a pro-democracy movement
that reached its height in July.
   Also today, Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Prapas
Limpabandhu, said he will visit Burma for trade and border talks
this month, breaking the international isolation of the new military
government.
   Prapas will be leading the first official foreign delegation to
Burma since military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in the
Sept. 18 coup.
   The world community has informally cooperated in refraining from
any moves that would imply formal recognition of the Saw Maung
government.
   Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila said Prapa's visit did not
necessarily mean Thailand will recognize the current government.

<HEAD>Study: Handgun Murder Risk Five Times Higher in Town With Weaker
Gun Control</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A study concludes that Seattle's weaker gun control
laws probably explain why the risk of being killed with a handgun
there is five times higher than in nearby Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   The researchers said that Seattle has a higher overall homicide
rate than Vancouver, and virtually all of the difference can be
explained by the city's higher incidence of handgun shootings.
   The researchers cautioned that similar studies should be done in
other cities, but they said their work suggests that ``a more
restrictive approach to handgun control may decrease national
homicide rates.''
   The study, directed by Dr. John Henry Sloan of Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle, is being published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The researchers noted that Vancouver and Seattle are similar
large cities 140 miles apart in the Pacific Northwest. However, the
Canadian city has tougher gun laws.
   In Vancouver, self-defense is not a legal reason to buy a
handgun, and concealed weapons are not allowed. Permits are required
to buy and transport handguns, and those obtained for recreation can
be fired only at licensed shooting clubs.
   Opponents of gun control argue that limiting access to guns will
have little effect on homicide rates, because those who want to kill
will find ways to obtain guns or will use other weapons.
   However, the researchers said Vancouver's rate of homicides with
other kinds of weapons was not significantly higher than Seattle's,
``suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by
other methods.''
   Other findings of the seven-year study included:
   _ The risk of being a homicide victim in Seattle was 63 percent
higher than in Vancouver. Virtually all the increased risk in
Seattle was due to a five-fold higher risk of homicide by firearms,
almost all of them handguns.
   _ The rates of burglary, robbery and assult were similar in the
two cities.
   _ Indians had the highest homicide rates in both cities.
   _ Asians in Seattle had higher homicide rates than their
counterparts in Vancouver, but there was little differences in other
racial groups between the two cities.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. James A. Mercy and Vernon N.
Houk of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said the
research is a step toward studying gun control in a scientific way.
They said more such work should be done.

<TEXT>
   Evangelist Billy Graham, who has preached
to more than 107 million people around the world, celebrated his
70th birthday quietly with relatives.
   ``The family has really wanted to make this a private affair,''
said Graham spokesman Larry Ross. ``They're going to keep it
low-key.''
   Graham, whose birthday was Monday, has said he won't retire until
his health or that of his wife, Ruth, makes it necessary.
   This year, Graham went to China in April, where he visited his
wife's birthplace in Jiangsu province, spoke with university
students and professors, visited a Bible printing plant in Nanjing,
preached at churches in Beijing and Shanghai and met with government
leaders, including Premier Li Peng.
   He was in England and Scandinavia in May and in the Soviet Union
in June to speak during the 1,000th anniversary celebration of the
Russian Orthodox Church.
   Graham appeared at the Republican and Democratic national
conventions, then embarked on a busy crusade: Buffalo, N.Y., in
August; Rochester, N.Y., in September; and Hamilton, Ontario, in
October.
   The Rochester tour stayed on schedule even though Graham was
hospitalized for several days after being bitten on the leg by a
brown recluse spider in Montreal.
   Two weeks ago, he told students at McMaster University in
Hamilton about brown recluse spiders.
   ``If you hear of one, don't go near him because he bit me, and
when they bite they put eight different kinds of poisons into your
bloodstream,'' Graham said.

<HEAD>Teacher Says He Won't Compromise Over Dress Code</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A blue jean-wearing teacher
suspended for not wearing a tie to class says a dress code
compromise that bans dungarees ``sounds like a stinking deal.''
   Superintendent Charles Chambers on Monday offered the compromise,
which would allow math teacher Bill Webb to return to work without a
tie. Webb said he has not worn a tie to class in at least 15 of his
20 years as an educator.
   Chambers, who has suspended the 46-year-old teacher three times
this school year for not wearing a tie, said Webb faces charges of
insubordination and could be dismissed if he won't agree to the
dress code changes.
   ``I'm not an unreasonable person, although I've been painted as
one,'' the superintendent said.
   In a meeting Monday night in this county seat on the Ohio River,
the Mason County Board of Education opened a two-week period on the
changes.
   Members of two teachers' unions met last week to develop a new
dress code. During the weekend, Chambers added the ban on jeans and
denim.
   ``It's a dress code policy formulated in conjunction with the
teachers,'' he said. ``It's sort of a middle ground. Ties will be
recommended but not required.''
   Chambers said that if Webb agrees to the new code, the board
would be willing to drop further penalties. He said he would
recommend Webb be fired if he doesn't change his mind. The board has
scheduled a hearing Dec. 1 on Webb's latest suspension.
   ``It sounds like a stinking deal,'' Webb said of Chambers' offer.
``He's still breaching my original contract with the board for 1988.
He's adding conditions.
   ``They can do it next year before contract time. He can't do it
this year.
   ``Unless the (Ohio) River starts flowing north, I expect the
board to fire me,'' said Webb.
   The tie requirement was imposed through a memo Chambers issued
shortly before school opened.
   Webb and other teachers contend the dress code is not valid
because it was issued after they signed their contracts for the
current school year.
   The county board on Monday rejected grievances filed by three
teachers over the current dress code. A union spokesman said they
would appeal.
   Webb's latest suspension, lasting 30 days, began on Halloween. He
has spent his time chopping wood and doing other chores around his
farm outside Gallipolis, Ohio.
   He also has a state hearing on his second suspension scheduled
Nov. 15 in Charleston before an education employees' hearing board.
   About 60 people, many supporting Webb, jammed the board's small
meeting room. One held a sign asking, ``Does Being On The Best
Dressed List Make A Successful Teacher?''
   ``Rescind the Webb suspension and get the Mason County school
system back to normal again and get Bill Webb back in the classroom
where he belongs,'' said Bob Brown of the West Virginia Federation
of Teachers.
   ``By your own assessment he's a good teacher. Our children are
the losers,'' Brown told the board.
   Webb teaches 124 of Point Pleasant High School's 695 students,
and Chambers bristled when West Virginia Education Association
representative Ed Stephenson implied the dispute had disrupted
teaching.
   ``If I was a teacher in Mason County, I'd be insulted by your
remarks,'' Chambers said.

<TEXT>
   Protestant and Roman Catholic church leaders
from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic ended their
``pilgrimage of hope'' on a note of optimism that the troubled
British province might soon know peace.
   ``We're realizing there is no such thing as green (Catholic)
tears or orange (Protestant) tears. The people of Ireland are
weeping together _ and this is significant,'' David Bleakley,
secretary of the Irish Council of Churches, said Monday.
   Bleakley was one of six high-level church delegates from the four
leading denominations of Northern Ireland and the republic who
participated in a three-day ecumenical institute in this Boston
suburb.
   ``A good seed has been planted and surely the harvest will be
bountiful,'' the Rev. James Hiles of the Episcopal Church of Our
Savior said at a news conference. The church sponsored the gathering
to mark the 90th anniversary of the church's founding in part by
Irish immigrants.
   The religious leaders also urged Americans to refrain from
sending donations to paramilitary organizations ``that will destroy
our beloved island.''
   The Most Rev. Robin Eames, archbishop of Ireland's Anglican
church, said the delegation was flatly opposed to misguided American
donations to Northern Ireland, whose current outbreak of political
and sectarian violence began in 1969.
   ``Our message is pure and simple: Money given to paramilitary
organizations is money for death, money for misery and money for
injury. It is pushing back the chance for reconciliation and peace
in Ireland,'' Eames said.
   Many groups in the United States, including the Ireland Fund,
Irish Northern Aid Committee and the Ancient Order of Hibernians,
solicit funds for distribution in Ireland. None acknowledge giving
funds for military use by factions such as the Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army.
   Bleakley joined his interdominational colleagues in urging
Americans to closely monitor their donations. ``Don't take chances
with American dollars,'' he said. ``We've shed tears and suffered
because of money that has come generously from America and been used
woefully.''
   The delegation also included Bishop Cahal B. Daly, whose Roman
Catholic diocese includes Belfast; the Presbyterian moderator in
Ireland, Dr. Godfrey Brown; the Rev. Charles Eyre, general secretary
of the Methodist Church in Ireland; and the Rev. Robert Davidson,
professor of Old Testament at the University of Glasgow.
   The clerics called Northern Ireland's conflict a ``young person's
tragedy,'' and urged educational integration to promote
cross-cultural communication.
   Eames stressed that education was but a part of what he said must
be a peaceful formula for political reform.
   ``It would be wrong if we were to give the impression that
education will be the answer to our problems. It is just a part of
the jigsaw puzzle,'' he said.

   A man told police he used a trophy to beat a

   ``His conscience was bothering him,'' Lt. Joan Ghougoian of the

   The 26-year-old man, whose name was not released pending an
arraignment today, says acquaintance Marquesa Johnson was slain in
January 1987 after they argued, according to police.
   Her body remained in the attic crawl space until Sunday, when the
man walked into the Fifth Precinct and surrendered, officials said.
   The girl's decomposed body was removed from the attic. Dental
records were used to identify Johnson, who had been on a missing
persons list.

   Rain fell on Election Day today in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio
Valley after snow settled on Sections of the West and Midwest, in
some places for the first time this season.
   Boise, Idaho, got its first flakes, a half inch of snow, as did
the valleys of eastern Oregon and northern Nevada, where up to 2
inches accumulated. About 2 inches of snow were reported in
northeast Wisconsin, too.
   A storm spread rain in the Northwest, but it amounted to no more
than a quarter-inch across the region. In Illinois, scattered rain
fell early this morning after light rain late Monday in the western
Ohio and western Tennessee valleys.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers from western and
central New England to the upper Ohio Valley, and from there to the
southern Appalachians and parts of Alabama and Mississippi; snow
mixed with rain in upper Michigan; rain from the Pacific Northwest
to the northern and central Plateau region; and snow in parts of
Montana and Wyoming.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s in northern New
England, and from Michigan to the upper Mississippi Valley, North
Dakota and the northern Rockies, and eastern Washington state; 70s
from the Carolinas to the Gulf Coast and the southern Plains, and in
Southern California; 80s in Florida, southern Louisiana, much of
Texas and the desert Southwest; 50s and 60s in the rest of the
nation.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 22 degrees at
Custer, S.D., to 77 at the Naval Air Station near Corpus Christi,
Texas.

<HEAD>Nanny, Granny Start Work As First Women Guards At Grim Dartmoor
Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETOWN, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 182 years as an all-male
preserve, grim, high-security Dartmoor Prison has appointed a granny
and a nanny as its first women guards.
   ``It's just a job. We have always known we could do these jobs
just as well as the men,'' Lynn Draper-Rush, 40, told a news
conference Monday.
   She and ex-nanny Melanie MacCallum, 26, began work after a
13-week training course at the Home Office, the government
department responsible for police and prisons.
   The jail, built in 1806 to house French prisoners captured during
the Napoleonic Wars, has a reputation as one of Britain's grimmest
and toughest.
   Murderers and rapists are among the 630 inmates it confines in
the middle of Dartmoor, a remote area of high, windswept moorland in
southwest England. In the past, when convicts were sentenced to the
now-abolished punishment of hard labor, gangs of Dartmoor prisoners
spent their days breaking rocks out on the moors in all weathers.
Many had their health permanently wrecked by the arduous toil.
   The village of Princetown consists mostly of the homes of the 250
prison guards and their families.
   Prison governor John May said he requested two women guards for
the prison under Britain's equal opportunities legislation, which
abolishes sexual discrimination in the work place.
   He said their appointment would be good for morale in the prison.
   It is rare for women to work in men's prisons. May said Mrs.
Draper-Rush, a former police catering officer, and Mrs. MacCallum
would work on equal terms with the male guards in most respects but
would not go into the prisoners' bathhouse or search inmates.
   Like the male guards, the two women will earn $23,541 a year and
work a 47-hour week.
   Severe overcrowding, poor facilities, old buildings and
increasingly rebellious inmates have contributed in recent years to
escalating rioting and other violence in Britain's ailing prison
service.
   Guards are unarmed in British prisons, but trained in unarmed
combat.

<HEAD>Japanese Toymaker Makes Donation To Apologize For Sambo Character</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese toymaker is donating more
than $250,000 in toys to poor children in San Francisco as a apology
for selling Little Black Sambo dolls in Japan.
   Sanrio Toy Co., whose U.S. operations are based here, also has
stopped making the Sambo character and two similar black-faced toys.
   Sanrio came under attack in July when The Washington Post carried
a story describing the popularity in Japan of black caricatures
based on Little Black Sambo, a children's book figure created by
British author Helen Bannerman in 1898.
   Sanrio executives apologized immediately and yanked $15 million
worth of the offending Sambo, Hanna, and Bibinba characters from the
company's 3,000 boutiques throughout Japan.
   Sanrio executives met with members of the Congressional Black
Caucus last week to propose a $257,000 toy distribution to poor
children, a Japan-U.S. children's exchange and the development of
multiracial characters for a monthly magazine the company publishes
for its millions of young Japanese customers.
   Kurt Yonezawa, vice president of Sanrio America Inc., said
apologies, while appropriate, are not enough.
   ``Love and friendship for other people is Sanrio's philosophy, so
it was natural for mne to come up with this idea,'' he said.
   The Congressional Black Caucus has been fighting racial
stereotyping by Japanese companies operating in the United States
and called the Sanrio move a victory.

<HEAD>Nebraska Find A Hard Life During Inner-City Visit</HEAD>

   Future teachers from a small Nebraska
college are seeing firsthand what their students may be like by
spending time in some of this city's worst neighborhoods.
   The visits are part of a course at Hastings College to educate
future teachers about the difficulties faced by urban minorities, as
well as the positive aspects of their lives.
   The lastest group, a class of 18 mostly white, middle-class
students, ends their five-day visit today.
   They saw abused and neglected children, homeless people, drug
busts, and a single mother taking care of seven children in a
one-room house.
   ``It's so easy to look the other way,'' said Kim Sperber, who
grew up in a white, middle-class family in a Denver suburb. ``I
never had a reason to go down to the city, so I didn't.''
   ``You may see some bums and some bag ladies, and that's enough,''
said student John Roebke. ``You don't want to see any more. You
don't want to find out how bad it really is. People who live in
suburbs or better areas are just isolated and ignorant that
situations like that exist in their own cities.''
   The course is required of all education majors at the small,
liberal arts college in Hastings in south central Nebraska.
Enrollment is about 800.
   ``The majority of our students come from small-town and ranching
families,'' said Jan Watkins, an education professor who directs the
course. ``Even those who come from large urban areas do not look at
the city and ethnic groups as this class forces them to do.''
   The students visited minority schools, toured a shelter for the
homeless, attended Sunday services at a black church, ate Mexican
and soul food, watched counselors work with abused children and rode
the streets with police officers.
   ``Everybody's blind to what's going on down there,'' student
Scott Rezac said. ``People wait until the last minute to do
something; people wait to help the kids in detention until they're
in detention. I didn't see one place for the kids to go at night,
like a gymnasium or any (recreation) centers.''
   The class, called the Multi-Cultural Experience, started about
eight years ago after national accrediting organizations told
colleges to develop courses for a greater understanding of minority
issues.
   It was offered as an elective during a winter before it was
developed into a semester-long requirement.
   Through the negatives, the students did find some signs of hope.
   At a detention center, workers ``were really trying to make a
change in the kids' lives,'' Wayne Wiens said. ``It wasn't just a
place to lock them back up.''
   And at a school, ``all the students seemed like they were glad to
be there. They wanted to learn,'' Angie Life said.

<HEAD>Angered By Choice Of New Sultan, Thousands Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry at the choice of a new sultan to lead
Nigeria's 50 million Moslems, thousands of people rioted in a
northwestern town, torching government offices and freeing 2,000
prisoners, state-run radio reported today.
   An independent Lagos newspaper said at least three people died in
Monday's rioting at Sokoto, 465 miles north of the capital, in Kano
province. The Guardian Express quoted no source and did not
elaborate.
   State-run Radio Nigeria mentioned no casualties and did not
estimate damage, which was inflicted a day after the provincial
military governor approved the appointment of Ibrahim Dasuki as
Sultan of Kano.
   Reporters in Lagos said people believed the military forced the
committee of Moslem elders that selected the new sultan to choose
Dasuki instead of the elder son of the late sultan Sadiq Abubakar.
   As sultan, Dasuki leads Nigeria's Moslems, nearly half the people
of black Africa's most powerful and populous nation. He is revered
by Moslems of neighboring West African states and he wields
political power as the sultan is consulted by Nigerian leaders of
all denominations.
   Abubakar was sultan for 50 years until he died last week. Dasuki
is a 56-year-old former civil servant.
   State radio said tension started building Friday in Sokoto, a
predominately Moslem town, after local state-owned Rima Radio
announced that Muhammadu Maccido, Abubaker's elder son, had been
appointed successor.
   Police arrested the station's general manager and four employees
after the announcement. Rima Radio later reported the nine-member
selection committee of Moslem elders, called kingmakers, had not yet
decided.
   Anticipating trouble when the true announcement was made,
authorities deployed police to strategic buildings and into the
streets.
   But Radio Nigeria said they fled when they saw the crowd of
thousands, who set fire to the radio station building before
marching on Sokoto Prison and freeing all the inmates.
   Rioters set alight the administrative block of the Health
Ministry and the local branch of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit
and Commerce International. Dasuki is chairman of the bank's local
board.
   There also was a power failure, but it was not immediately clear
if it was connected with the rioting.
   Troops were called in and, together with police, twice repulsed
demonstrators' attempts to storm the sultan's palace. Radio Nigeria
said frustrated rioters then blocked streets with burning tires and
billboards and damaged several public and private vehicles.
   Security forces managed to get most rioters to disperse by Monday
afternoon, though sporadic disturbances continued around the palace
and Sokoto's main market, the radio said.

<HEAD>Bush's Lead: Take Your Pick</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with new CBS and Harris figures grafs 2-4, 10, 16-17.</NOTE>

   A fifth of the electorate remained in flux up to
the last moment in the long presidential campaign, their indecision
contributing to the variance in poll estimates of George Bush's
advantage.
   National surveys as late as this morning found Bush maintaining
his months-old lead over Michael Dukakis, but the Republican
nominee's margin varied from four points in one survey to nine in
another and 11 in a third.
   A CBS News poll Sunday and Monday found Bush pulling further
ahead, to a nine-point lead, after some weekend tightening. A Harris
poll said Dukakis had closed to within four, also citing late
tightening through the weekend. It also said the movement had halted
Monday.
   Gallup found Bush solidly ahead and holding steady.
   Pollsters attributed the differing figures to relatively high
levels of voter dissatisfaction and indecision, factors that
increase the difficulty of determining who is likely to vote _ and
make turnout a crucial element.
   In Gallup's final pre-election poll, 20 percent were undecided or
said they could change their minds, easily enough to alter the
outcome in the states, including some big states, where the election
was close.
   ``When the vote is soft like this, the get-out-the vote efforts
take on a lot more importance,'' said Gallup pollster Larry Hugick.
``People don't feel about it strongly. They can vote the way they
say, they can stay home, or they can be urged by somebody to change
their vote.''
   Only about half of each candidates' supporters in the Gallup poll
backed them strongly, indicating the extent of voter dissatisfaction.
   Gallup gave Bush an 11-point lead among likely voters, 53 percent
to 42 percent. When it apportioned the 5 percent who remained
undecided by their background and ideology, Gallup arrived at a
56-44 percent estimate.
   The Harris poll, done Wednesday through Monday, put the race at
51-47 percent. CBS had it at 52-43 percent Sunday and Monday, the
same margin it found Friday and Saturday but up from its six-point
spread Saturday and Sunday.
   Gallup, however, said it had found the race essentially stable,
with Bush leading by 12 points on Thursday and Friday and by 11 on
Saturday and Sunday. Its final estimate combined the results of the
four days.
   In addition to the difficulties of defining likely voters, the
differing results indicated the inherent imprecision of polling. In
the 1984 election, one in which voter sentiment was considerably
more solid, final pre-election polls gave President Reagan leads
ranging from 10 to 25 points. He won by 18.
   The new CBS poll found Bush ahead in the South, Dukakis narrowly
ahead in the Northeast and the race close elsewhere. Gallup,
similarly, found the race close in the East, the industrial Midwest
and on the Pacific coast.
   ``The South is a big blowout'' for Bush, Hugick said. ``But
there's a lot of states that don't look like the national race.''
   In an example of the possible effect of turnout, Gallup found
Bush leading by eight points among all registered voters, compared
with 11 points among the registered voters that it determined were
likely to vote.
   Harris, which consistently has had the race closer than most
other polls, had put it at 50-45 as of Sunday and 50-46 as of
Monday. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll Sunday also found Bush
ahead by 5 points, while other polls found Bush leads of nine, 10,
11 and 12.
   The latest Harris poll was conducted among 3,216 likely voters;
the Gallup poll, among 2,626; and the CBS poll, among 1,550. The
Harris and Gallup polls had margins of error of plus or minus two
percentage points; CBS, three points.

   Typhoon Skip roared into the South
China Sea today after killing at least 22 people and forcing
thousands to flee their homes in a nation still reeling from a storm
that killed hundreds last month.
   Skip's center passed about 100 miles south of Manila, sparing the
capital from the high winds and flooding that Typhoon Ruby brought
two weeks ago.
   But officials said Skip triggered tornadoes, landslides and
widespread flooding across part of the country's midsection known as
the ``typhoon belt'' _the central Visayas islands and the Bicol
Peninsula of Luzon island.
   The government weather service said that at mid-morning Skip was
about 150 miles southwest of Manila. Maximum sustained winds,
clocked at 108 mph when Skip hit the islands Monday, weakened today
to about 93 mph as the storm crossed the Visayas, the weather
service said.
   Reports of damage and casualties from Typhoon Skip were sketchy
because of poor communications to the affected areas.
   The Social Services Department said at least 400,000 people were
``affected'' by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property were
damaged or destroyed. It said most were on Leyte Island, which was
without electricity because Skip's winds blew down power lines.
   Telephone operators in Manila said all lines to Leyte were down
today.
   The Office of Civil Defense said seven children were killed in
flooding late Monday in the Manila suburb of Pasig, where
floodwaters from Typhoon Ruby have still not receded.
   The Red Cross said at least six people were killed Monday in
Camarines Sur province on the Bicol Peninsula. They included three
bodies recovered from a landslide in Pasacao about 210 miles
southeast of Manila in Camarines Sur. Twenty other people were
missing and believed buried in the slide.
   The Red Cross said the other fatalities in Camarines Sur include
at least two children who died when a tornado triggered by Skip tore
through another town in Camarines Sur. One person drowned elsewhere
in Camarines Sur, the Red Cross said.
   On Panay island, the government's Office of Civil Defense said
six people drowned in Capiz province and two died in Aklan province.
One person died on Marinduque island.
   Government officials said more than 3,000 people were left
homeless on Cebu island and altogether 20,000 were ``affected'' by
the storm. Shelters were set up in schools and churches to care for
the homeless.
   On Mindoro island, the Red Cross said 80 percent of San Jose, a
city of about 70,000 people, was under water today.
   Skip came ashore early Monday on Samar island, 410 miles
southeast of Manila, and moved across the islands of Masbate,
Romblon, Tablas and Mindoro.
   Departmental spokeswoman Teresita Padua estimated damage on Leyte
alone at about $400,000.
   In Manila, the government ordered schools closed today. Most
domestic flights from the Manila airport were canceled but
Philippine Airlines said service would be restored by tonight.
   The typhoon passed well south of the six American military
installations, including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval
base, where damage was reported minimal.
   Skip is the 20th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the archipelago
this year. Typhoon Ruby struck Oct. 24 and tropical storm Tess swept
through the Visayas Islands on Saturday.
   Officials said Ruby killed at least 181 people on land. At least
64 others were killed and more than 200 are missing from the
passenger ship Dona Marilyn, which sank 300 miles southeast of
Manila during the typhoon.
   Government officials said at least 11 people were killed Saturday
during floods caused by Tess.

   Military rescue teams and doctors today reached
with food and medicine a remote mountainous southern region
devastated by an earthquake that the government said killed more
than 900 people.
   The quake, which registered 7.6 on the Richter scale, was China's
deadliest in 12 years. It struck Sunday in a thickly jungled area of
Yunnan province, near the Burmese border.
   The national television news tonight broadcast the first pictures
from the scene, showing an aerial view of row upon row of collapsed
houses in one village and victims being pulled from the wreckage.
   Most of the region's mud and wood homes are built on stilts
because of its heavy rains and would have little chance of surviving
a major quake.
   The television report, which said the quake affected a
16,000-mile, 14-county area, also showed army trucks loaded with
troops moving into the area to help rescue work. It did not say how
many troops were deployed.
   The Ministry of Civil Affairs said 938 died in the quake, said
Roy Morey, representative of the U.N. Development Program. The
ministry told the British Broadcasting Corp. and other reporters
that 939 people had been killed.
   Morey said the ministry would not tell him how many people were
injured or what were the immediate relief needs.
   The quake was centered in Yunnan's heavily forested Lancang and
Menglian counties, about 240 miles southwest of the provincial
capital of Kunming. The State Seismology Bureau said 40 aftershocks
had hit the stricken sub-tropical area, the strongest measuring 7.2.
   Nearly all the houses in Lancang county, population 400,000, were
destroyed, Morey quoted the Civil Affairs Ministry as saying.
   Most homes in Menglian county were also destroyed, said a
reporter with the official Xinhua news agency in Kunming.
   The reporter, who declined to be identified, said rescue teams,
doctors, food and supplies reached the stricken area and a
delegation was on its way from Beijing led by State Councilor Song
Jian, a Cabinet member without portfolio.
   The reporter said the area had ample food and water supplies but
its main road link to the outside world, cut by quake damage, was
still under repair.
   Many of the casualties are believed to be from the Lahu minority,
a Tibetan-Burmese hill people who are mainly subsistence farmers and
hunters. They have their own language and are Buddhists.
   Yunnan, with a land area nearly as large as California, has a
population of more than 34 million. Lahus in the province number
about 300,000.
   The death toll in Sunday's quake is China's highest since July
28, 1976, when 242,000 people were killed in the northeast China
city of Tangshan in the nation's worst natural disaster in modern
times.
   That quake measured 7.8 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake,
with a reading of 7.0 ten times as powerful as a 6.0, which is also
capable of inflicting heavy damage.
   China's last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985, when a 7.4 temblor
killed 71 people and injured 125 in the far western Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
   A quake measuring 5.0 occurred Oct. 15 in southern Yunnan, which
is hit frequently by earth tremors, but there were no reports of
casualties.
   Seismologists said they did not know if the Yunnan quakes were
related to a powerful temblor that hit far western China on Saturday.
   That quake, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, was centered in
an uninhabited area of the Tanggula Mountains in western Qinghai
province and northern Tibet. Officials in Qinghai said they had no
reports of casualties.

   George Bush and Dan Quayle swept to victory today
over Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, winning 55 percent of the
vote in the traditional U.S. presidential election straw poll
conducted by Harry's New York Bar in Paris.
   Coming each year hot on the heels of Dixville Notch, the results
of Harry's straw vote is something of a bellwether, wrong only once
since it began in 1924. The goof was in 1976, when the traveling
Americans gave the nod to President Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter.
   The poll was opened at Harry's Bar on Oct. 27 and closed at 1:30
p.m. today.
   According to owner Andy MacElhone, whose father Harry established
the famed watering hole in 1911, the Republican ticket won 579 of
the 1,050 votes cast, or 55 percent. The Democrats got 471 votes, or
45 percent.
   MacElhone was gearing up for his all-night election bash.
   ``There seem to be a lot more Americans in Paris this year,'' he
said. ``More than last year, and a lot more than the last election
year. I guess they are starting to get used to the six-franc
dollar.''

   Illegal immigrants who took advantage of the government's amnesty
program can now apply for permanent residency, and the first
applicants included a cowboy in Texas, a teen-ager in Arizona and a
laborer in Illinois.
   Turnout at immigration offices was light Monday, but Immigration
and Naturalization Service officials expect about 1.5 million of the
1.8 million non-agricultural amnesty recipients to eventually apply
for permanent residency.
   Permanent residents receive a so-called green card _ they've
actually been white since 1976 _ which allows them to leave and
enter the country at will and to eventually apply for citizenship.
   ``It's just exciting, I guess, getting something like this,''
said Shane O'Neil, a 31-year-old cowboy. ``It's liberty for me.''
   A native of Yugoslavia, O'Neil received his card after passing
the required tests and and having his fingerprints taken at the El
Paso, Texas, office. He illegally entered the country when he jumped
a ship in Chicago 15 years ago.
   With television cameras documenting the moment, O'Neil calmly
recited the colors of the U.S. flag, explained what the flag's 13
stripes symbolize, told how many states are in the union, identified
Ronald Reagan as the president and defined the Constitution as the
supreme law of the land.
   Amnesty recipients who apply for permanent residency must either
take a 60-hour English and civics class from an INS-certified school
or pass an oral and written test similar to the citizenship test
given to permanent residents who enter this country legally.
   All have to pay an application fee of $80 a person or a maximum
$240 for a family. They have a year to apply.
   ``Today marks the next step on the road to American citizenship
for hundreds of thousands of legalized aliens, and it is with great
pleasure I accept your applications for permanent residency,'' said
Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the INS in Los
Angeles.
   Ezell accepted several applications at a morning news conference,
where he handed out buttons labeled ``1994, your first vote,'' a
reminder of the first general election in which amnesty applicants
can vote.
   Charlie Troy, spokesman for the New York District of the INS,
said scores of people mistakenly crowded the legalization office in
Manhattan, but weren't eligible yet to apply for their green cards.
   In Chicago, Alejandro Garcia and his family received permanent
residency on Monday, six days before his 40th birthday.
   ``It's early, but it's a great present,'' said Garcia, a pallet
loader from Hammond, Ind. ``We love the United States.''
   Sergio Molina, 13, and his mother, Molly Molina, were the first
applicants in Phoenix. Mrs. Molina passed the required English and
civics test. Sergio was exempt because of his age.
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, people who
had lived illegally in the United States since before Jan. 1, 1982,
were allowed to apply for amnesty from deportation and were given
temporary permission to work.
   The yearlong program ended for most immigrants last May 4, though
special agricultural workers have until Nov. 30 to apply.
   Those who waited until the last day to apply for amnesty have
until Nov. 4, 1990, to apply for permanent residency.
   People who have completed 40 hours of an approved 60-hour course
don't have to take the test for permanent residency. Neither do
agricultural workers who applied for amnesty under a separate
program, children under 16, adults 65 and older or people who are
physically unable to take the course or test.
   Aliens can apply for citizenship after five years of permanent
residency. Those who are married to U.S. citizens can apply for
citizenship after three years of permanent residency.

<HEAD>Sources Say Chun Doo-hwan Ready to Surrender Most Wealth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan is ready
to surrender most of his wealth to buy peace from opponents' demands
for his arrest, government party sources said today.
   In the latest anti-Chun protest, eight students armed with
homemade firebombs occupied a prosecutor's office in central Taejon
city today to highlight calls for Chun's arrest. Police arrested all
the students within 30 minutes.
   ``Mr. Chun still thinks he has no ill-gotten wealth, but he is
willing to donate most of his assets if he is assured that it would
quiet down the raging public protests,'' said one of two party
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In return, the Democratic Justice Party source said, Chun wants
assurances he will be left alone by investigators from opposition
parties and those representing his friend and successor, Roh Tae-woo.
   The second party source said that by giving up most of his
wealth, Chun hopes to atone for major financial scandals in which
some of his relatives have been implicated.
   Chun is accused of corruption and human rights abuses during his
seven years of authoritarian rule which ended in February. The
National Assembly is conducting an unprecedented probe into the
corruption allegations.
   The former president, his associates and relatives are accused of
diverting huge sums in stocks and land and sending much of it
overseas to the United States and Australia.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, has denied involvement in any corruption.
   The two party sources said Chun has personal assets of $5.7
million, including a $1.4 million residence _ about twice as much as
the amount he officially registered with authorities in 1983.
   They attributed Chun's greater wealth to increases in land prices
during the past five years.
   President Roh, in Australia on an official visit, reportedly
asked the Australian government to check if Chun has any personal
assets there.
   Last week, thousands of people tried to march on Chun's house to
press for his arrest. Opponents are planning another march on Chun's
house Thursday after a major rally in central Seoul.
   On Monday, another member of the ex-president's family was
arrested on corruption charges. Chun Soon-hwan, 67, a cousin, was
charged with taking $52,000 in bribes from a businessman.
   The former president's younger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, 46, was
sentenced in August to seven years' imprisonment for taking bribes
and embezzling millions of dollars in official funds.
   Government sources said two other family members may be arrested
soon on corruption charges.

<HEAD>Another Close Call at O'Hare Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 came within a mile
horizontally of a United Airlines 737 shortly after both planes took
off from O'Hare International Airport, and federal officials blamed
a controller for the tight squeeze.
   The mistake Saturday was the 32nd error by a controller at O'Hare
this year, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
   The planes took off simultaneously from parallel runways, the FAA
said Monday. Because of low cloud cover that diminished visibility,
the controller should have staggered the takeoffs, the FAA said. The
controller also failed to give one of the planes order to turn in
time to maintain adequate separation.
   The controller was relieved from his position after the incident
and given remedial retraining before being reinstated, the FAA said.
   The jump in mistakes at O'Hare has come at a time of increasing
air traffic at the airport, the world's busiest, and rising concern
over safety. In October, the FAA produced a 100-step plan calling
for the addition of more controllers and installation of new
equipment at O'Hare, among other improvements.

<HEAD>Exhaust Stack Suspected Source of Plutonium Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials suspect an exhaust-stack leak was
responsible for traces of plutonium found on 18 employees at the
Savannah River nuclear materials plant in recent weeks.
   And in Golden, Colo., a federal inspector said several storage
sites at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant were becoming
dangerously overcrowded, greatly increasing the chance of an
accident involving radioactive and hazardous wastes there.
   At Savannah River, a Du Pont company spokesman said Monday that
workers in the laboratory from which the suspect exhaust comes
analyze samples of nuclear materials produced by the plant,
including solutions that contain plutonium.
   It was discovered Oct. 26 that the workers had plutonium traces
on their hands and shoes.
   There are a series of valves through which the plutonium may have
entered the air from the 75-foot stack. Air from those valves is now
being sent through an extra sand filter, said Clif Webb, spokesman
for Du Pont, which operates the facility for the U.S. Department of
Energy.
   The plant in Aiken County, S.C., near the Georgia border,
produces plutonium and tritium for the nation's nuclear weapons.
   Since April, all three Savannah River reactors have been shut
down for maintenance amid questions of safety. A number of
near-accidents and several releases of radioactive materials have
been disclosed.
   The search for the Oct. 26 leak concentrated during the weekend
on the laboratory in the F-area, the plant's chemical separations
facility.
   ``We're continuing to investigate it,'' Webb said. ``But we feel
certain that that is the source point.''
   He said air leaving the room will now go through a sand filter
before it is released into the outside air. The air from the room
already goes through two other filters.
   Contamination was found on the shoes of one other worker over the
weekend, Webb said. That made 18 employees who came in contact with
the contamination since it was first discovered.
   Webb said the radiation exposure was about 1 microcurie. In
comparison, an average smoke alarm gives off about 3 microcuries,
Webb said.
   ``We're talking about a very low release, no health threat to the
employees or the public,'' Webb said.
   In Colorado, officials from the state health department and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency found during a visit last week that
five of 14 permitted storage areas are too crowded, said Nat Miullo,
who oversees Rocky Flats for the EPA.
   The waste is being kept in steel crates and barrels.
   ``Increasingly crowded conditions are decreasing the facility's
ability to react in the event of an incident,'' Miullo said.
   Fred Dowset, who heads the Health Department's waste management
unit, declined comment on specifics of his inspection.
   Dowset acknowledged, however, that some storage areas were
crowded, and cited inadequate aisle space as one concern.
   The chief cause of the crisis was a ban last month by Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus against all waste shipments. The Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls has stored Rocky Flats waste
for 20 years.
   Andrus' ban was prompted by repeated delays in the opening of the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a permanent disposal site near
Carlsbad, New Mexico. The facility was supposed to begin accepting
waste from Idaho last month. But political bickering and
environmental concerns have pushed back its opening at least until
early next year.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Federal Sentencing Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has
upheld federal sentencing guidelines, rejecting the argument that
the commission that set the standards violates the separation of
powers mandated by the Constitution.
   The court's decision Monday reversed a U.S. district judge's
ruling that the guidelines were unconstitutional because the
commission was ordered by Congress, appointed by the president and
contains three federal judges.
   An economist, a lawyer, a sociologist and a prison administrator
also are on the seven-member commission.
   The decision upholds the conviction of a Pittsburgh man and
orders the district judge to resentence the man under the guidelines.
   The panel has been developing guidelines for individual federal
crimes since 1985 and is now working on guidelines for criminal
charges against corporations.
   There is a 25 percent sentencing range in the guidelines, but in
cases with unusual mitigating factors, judges are allowed to go
outside them.
   Since the guidelines were introduced, 265 district judges
nationwide have rendered decisions on their constitutionality. Of
those, 150 have said the guidelines are unconstitutional, according
to John Steer, general counsel for the United States Sentencing
Commission.
   A case from Missouri addressing the issue was argued before the
U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 5. The court has not announced any
decision.
   Monday's decision involved Pittsburgh attorney Alan Frank, who
had been sentenced to 302 days in prison for interstate flight to
avoid prosecution for theft and forgery.
   Although the guidelines called for Frank to be sentenced to 30 to
37 months in prison, U.S. District Judge Donald E. Zeigler on April
1 sentenced him to 302 days. The appeals court ordered Zeigler to
resentence Frank under the guidelines.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's condition worsened today when his
blood pressure plummeted and his temperature soared, but later the
frail monarch showed a slight improvement, the Imperial Household
Agency reported.
   Hirohito, 87, suffered what appeared to be his worst crisis since
he fell ill Sept. 19 with internal bleeding. His temperature,
normally 95.9 degrees, soared to 102.2 degrees this afternoon. But
at 8:30 p.m., it had dropped to 99.1 degrees, the agency said.
   His blood pressure remained dangerously low, at 76 over 40. In
the morning it had been 126 over 60 but dropped to 68 over 30, a
level that can cause brain damage if not raised.
   Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said Hirohito remained conscious but
had continued to discharge blood, and doctors were standing by to
give more blood transfusions.
   ``His condition has slightly improved since 5:30 (p.m.), but we
are still concerned about his condition and we will continue to
monitor it carefully,'' Maeda said.
   Japanese Broadcasting Corp. said Hirohito today received an
emergency transfusion of 1.26 pints of blood. The emperor has
received 41.14 pints of blood since he first coughed up blood seven
weeks ago.
   Palace sources said it would be difficult to continue with
massive transfusions if the emperor continues to discharge or vomit
a large amount of blood. They said earlier that doctors were having
difficult finding suitable veins to administer the transfusions.
   Meanwhile, Prince Aya, the emperor's grandson, visited Hirohito
with his family. Aya had been studying at Britain's Oxford Univerity
and hastily returned to Japan on Monday after the emperor's
condition worsened.
   Aya's return ``was rather hasitily decided because of the
emperor's worsening condition,'' Maeda said.

   An 81-year-old former legislator says he is happy
he won more than $39 million in the state lottery, although he was a
bit skeptical about having to wait six weeks for his first check.
   ``Look at that,'' quipped James Soper, a Cicero Republican who
served in the Illinois Senate from 1966 to 1978. ``The state's
getting all that interest on my money.''
   At a news conference Monday, Soper said he would share 20 percent
of his winnings _ the second largest Lotto jackpot in state history
_ with his longtime secretary, Lois Anderson, who buys lottery
tickets with him.
   Soper, a lawyer, said he would donate some of the money to
various charities for senior citizens and young people, and Mrs.
Anderson said she would travel ``if he gives me some time off.''
   Soper described his prize as ``better than a stick in the eye.
It's not going to change my life. I'm too old. I can't get in
trouble.''
   He will receive his first payment in about five to six weeks,
lottery officials said. The prize will be distributed in annual
installments of $1.95 million over 20 years.
   Mrs. Anderson, 60, who has been Soper's secretary for 38 years,
said she was annoyed at first when her boss called her Monday,
because it was her day off. ``From now on I'll take all his calls,''
she joked.
   Soper said he let an Illinois State Lottery computer at a Cicero
grocery store near his office pick the six winning numbers for
Saturday's Lotto drawing: 33, 35, 43, 44, 45, 52.
   The $39,060,000 jackpot was second only to the $40 million won by
Michael Wittkowski on Sept. 1, 1984.
   Soper said he usuallly spends between $20 and $30 a week on
lottery tickets, but for the large jackpot he bought 100 $1 tickets.
   Soper said though the money wouldn't change his life, he was not
so sure about Mrs. Anderson. ``She's liable to leave me and I won't
have a secretary,'' he worried.

   A memorial church service
was held today one year after an IRA bomb explosion in this small
town killed 11 people.
   Relatives and friends of the victims and survivors attended the
service of hymns, prayers and readings at the town's Presbyterian
church.
   The bomb exploded Nov. 8, 1987, in a community center where
people had gathered to attend a memorial service for Britain's war
dead.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army said the bomb was set to
explode as soldiers marched by, but an army device set it off early.
The army denied the claim.
   The Rev. David Couples described today's memorial as ``a strictly
private affair.''
   A memorial wreath-laying ceremony and another church service were
planned for Sunday in this town near the border with the Irish
Republic.
   The IRA is fighting to force the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Long-Lost Sisters Who Met in Jail Find Half-Brother, Also in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two long-lost sisters who were reunited
behind bars have found their half-brother, who's also in prison, a
newspaper reported today.
   Joyce Lott, 27, and Mary Jones, 29, met in the detention area of
the Women's Correctional Center in August, and pieced together
enough information of their early childhood to suspect they were
sisters. A longtime family friend provided convincing evidence in
late September.
   The two women knew they had a brother named Billy Jones, who
lives in Virginia. But they also figured out that they had a
half-brother, Frank Strickland.
   The State newspaper printed a story Sunday about the two women,
and it was read by the woman who adopted Frank shortly after he was
born. Frank Despiau, serving a 12-year sentence at Walden
Correctional Institution in Columbia on a variety of charges, called
one of his half-sisters.
   ``A miracle,'' Despiau said. ``That's what you call it, a
miracle. I'm happy, excited. Here it is: I'm 25 years old and I'm
finding out I have real brothers and sisters. It's a miracle. I
can't wait to see them.''
   The mother of the four, Shirley Jones, was in the process of
divorcing her husband, a career soldier, when he left for another
assignment in 1962 or '63, taking the two oldest children, Billy and
Mary, with him.
   Joyce, who was less than 2 years of age, was left with Mrs.
Jones, who was pregnant with Frank, Mary Jones said. Joyce was
adopted by one couple and Frank by another woman three days after he
was born.
   The two women met in prison after being told by several other
inmates and guards that they looked alike.
   Despiau is serving time on drug, burglary and larceny charges.
   Ms. Jones, now in a work-release program at State Park
Correctional Center, and Ms. Lott, who will be at Women's
Correctional Center at least two more years, were arrested on drug
charges.
   Corrections officials said Monday they don't know when a meeting
will be arranged among the three.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa
was greeted by a kindergarden children's choir when she arrived
today for her first visit to this racially divided nation.
   The 78-year-old nun, who said she hoped to steer clear of
political controversy, plans to establish a mission in Khayelitsha,
an impoverished black township outside Cape Town.
   ``To tell the truth, I don't know anything about politics,'' she
told reporters at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport. ``What is
important is that we love one another.''
   Mother Teresa declined to comment on South Africa's political
situation and said she plans no meetings with government officials
during her weeklong stay, which will include visits to the major
cities.
   Asked if South Africa's poor had suffered because of the
white-dominated government's policy, she replied: ``We are the
government, all of us. It is our duty to love and serve the poor,
not only the duty of some people.''
   Accompanying Mother Teresa were four nuns from India, England and
Burundi, who will run the new mission that is to provide food,
clothing, shelter and what she called ``tender, loving care to the
poorest of the poor.''
   Archbishop Stephen Naidoo of Cape Town, who has repeatedly
invited Mother Teresa to come to South Africa, welcomed her.
   ``We need someone to show us how to live together, how to
transcend the barriers of race and religion,'' he told the news
conference.
   Among the 300 people greeting Mother Teresa at the airport were
about 70 kindergarten children who sang in her honor.
   Born in Skopje, Yugoslavia, of an ethnic Albanian family, Mother
Teresa founded the Missionaries if Charity order in 1950 and became
known as the Saint of Calcutta for her work with the poor in that
Indian city. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and has traveled
widely since then to establish 384 missions in 84 countries. Forty
of the missions are in Africa.

<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court today criticized the army
for overcrowded conditions at the Ketziot tent prison and for
failing to expedite judicial review for 1,500 detainees jailed there
without trial.
   But the three-judge panel rejected an appeal for release by 14
detainees, only five of whom are still held.
   The court upheld the army's right to imprison Palestinians from
the occupied territories in Israel despite Geneva conventions
against transferring prisoners across borders.
   An army spokeswoman said 1,558 inmates were under administrative
detention in Ketziot, located in the Negev Desert near the Egyptian
border.
   This was a decline from about 2,700 detentions without trial at
the peak of army sweeps during the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. More than 300 Palestinians and 11
Israelis have died in the 11-month uprising.
   The army had no official reaction to the decision by the high
court.
   But one military official said the army was satisfied with the
ruling for upholding the military's right to jail Palestinian
detainees inside Israel.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
overcrowding at Ketzoit had been relieved since the judges visited
the camp in the summer.
   In a 45-page ruling, Chief Justice Meir Shamgar singled out
Israel's system of administrative detentions, or jailing
Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activism for up to six months
without trial.
   ``Negating freedom without the approval of a judicial authority
is ... a drastic and serious step which the law allows only where
there are essential and absolute security concerns,'' Shamgar wrote.
   He said about 28 percent of administrative detentions have been
overturned on appeal, and urged the army to ensure appeals are heard
within three weeks after jailing to avoid ``errors in judgment and
fact whose significance mean violating a man's freedom without a
reasonable basis.''
   His statement was seen as criticism of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who revoked a regulation requiring military judges to review
cases of administrative detention within 96 hours.
   Administrative detention has been criticized by the United States
as a violation of due process.
   In the ruling, Shamgar said he called overcrowding at Ketziot the
camp's ``main problem.''
   When the justices toured the camp, they found 28 prisoners jammed
into some tents where the inmates were forced to sleep with no room
for mattresses and personal belongings.
   ``Our impression is that overcrowding at Ketziot Camp must be
resolved,'' Shamgar wrote.
   The justices urged the army to reduce the number of prisoners in
each tent. They also said doctors should examine prisoners before
incarceration.
   Shamgar found no justification for complaints of maltreatment at
Ketziot, but noted complaints of ``violent treatment and
humiliation'' of some prisoners while en route to the prison.
   ``Harming a man who is tied and helpless is a shameful and cruel
act requires an appropriate response that matches the action,'' said
Shamgar.

   For the seventh time in as many years,
Manson Family member Patricia Krenwinkel, convicted in the Sharon
Tate-La Bianca murders, has been refused parole by the state Board
of Prison Terms.
   ``This degree of barbaric, violent behavior has no equal,''
Commissioner Rudolph Caspro said Monday in announcing the board's
decision.
   Throughout the two-hour hearing, Ms. Krenwinkel, 40, showed
little emotion, staring out an adjacent window.
   Ms. Krenwinkel, who was convicted in seven of the Charles Manson
cult slayings, is eligible for parole in another year.
   The board commended Ms. Krenwinkel for good prison behavior, but
recommended individual therapy, should it become available at the
prison, and urged her to develop a job skill.
   A recent psychological evaluation found Ms. Krenwinkel was no
longer a threat to society. But the board called the report
inconclusive and said Ms. Krenwinkel required more rehabilitation.
   Ms. Krenwinkel's attorney, Wendy Parks, criticized the board for
recommending individual counseling when it is unavailable at the
prison.
   Before the hearing, Stephen Kay, the deputy district attorney who
prosecuted the Manson case, said Ms. Krenwinkel shows little remorse.
   ``She's probably the most cold-blooded murderess I've ever met in
my 21 years in the D.A.'s office. This is a person without a heart
and without a soul,'' Kay said. ``She has no remorse. Her only
remorse is that she got caught.''
   Actress Sharon Tate, 26, then eight months pregnant, was found
stabbed Aug. 9, 1969, at the Beverly Hills home she shared with her
movie director husband, Roman Polanski. Four others with her were
stabbed and shot.
   A night later, the bodies of wealthy grocer Leno LaBianca and his
wife, Rosemary, were found in their Los Feliz home. At both homes,
walls were smeared with bloody scrawlings.
   At her trial, Ms. Krenwinkel testified that she stabbed one of
the victims so many times that her hand throbbed afterward.

<HEAD>Nation's First Governmental Needle Exchange Begins Slowly</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th, 14th grafs to add that police commissioner is black.</NOTE>

   Only two people received free needles on the
first day of a program for drug addicts that seeks to stem the
spread of AIDS, but an official declared the nation's first
government needle giveaway ``an enormous success.''
   Dr. Stephen Joseph, the city's health commissioner, said he
anticipated a slow start for the experiment, which calls for
participation by 400 of the city's estimated 200,000 drug addicts.
   The experiment is an attempt to learn whether giving intravenous
drug users clean needles will limit needle-sharing among addicts.
AIDS can be spread through the use of contaminated needles, and
health officials say drug abusers are a major conveyor of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome to heterosexuals.
   The program has drawn opposition from the city's top police
official and some other black and Hispanic leaders, who say giving
out needles encourages drug abuse.
   ``It's genocide, pure and simple,'' said City Councilman Hilton
Clark of Harlem.
   But Joseph contended the black community is bearing the brunt of
the AIDS crisis. ``The lives that can be saved if this program works
is the lives of black women and babies,'' he said.
   The two men who received needles and syringes Monday had to find
their way to a small unmarked room at the city's Health Department.
Other sites had been planned but abandoned because of neighborhood
complaints.
   ``I think the enormous success of today is that the program got
off the ground at all,'' said Joseph. ``Nobody stopped us from doing
it.''
   The program is the first such government-sponsored program in the
nation, although similar ones have operated in Europe.
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn had backed a proposal similar to the
New York program, but it was rejected by the Boston City Council
earlier this year. A pilot program in Portland, Ore., has been
delayed until next month. In Tacoma, Wash., a private individual has
been distributing needles with help from the health department.
   In New York, needles will be given only to addicts at least age
18 who have applied for drug treatment and been denied immediate
admission to the city's overcrowded programs. Addicts also will
receive counseling and help to get into a drug rehabilitation
program.
   In a speech to executives in Manhattan on Monday, U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop endorsed the concept of needle exchanges,
although he said later he was unfamiliar with New York's program.
   He conditioned his support to programs limited to those who have
not sought drug treatment. New York's does not have that restriction.
   Joseph proposed the program more than two years ago, but state
health officials were reluctant to approve it. Mayor Edward I. Koch
has backed the plan, but it was opposed by Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward, who is black, and City Council's Black and Hispanic
Caucus.
   Applicants fill out a consent form, take a blood test and receive
a kit containing a condom, sterile water, cotton, a lubricant and
pamphlets about safe sex and needle hygiene.
   Any addict who tries to get a new needle without returning the
old one will be expelled from the program, Joseph said. Researchers
will test blood from the used needles to see if they are being
shared.
   While in the program, addicts will be immune from prosecution for
having the syringes. The sale of unprescribed needles is legal in 38
states, but not in New York.

   Unusually cool and rainy summer weather has caused
severe damage to Japan's rice and vegetable crops, boosting food
prices and requiring government aid to farmers, agriculture
officials reported today.
   The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries estimated
crop damage at $2.92 billion, the highest loss since a record $5.55
billion in damage was reported in 1980.
   The government will grant low-interest loans to farmers hard hit
by crop losses, said Toshio Yamada, an official of the Association
of Agricultural Cooperatives.
   In the Tokyo area, prices of 14 vegetables jumped 50 percent in
October over a year ago, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
   In northeastern Japan, where 91 percent of the crop losses
occurred, 1,630,000 acres of crops out of a total 2,425,540 acres
were damaged by low temperatures and heavy rains, the ministry said.
   It said 61 percent of the damage, or $1.79 billion, affected rice
crops. Damage was so severe that some farmers were unable to grow
enough rice even for their own needs, Yamada said.
   Japan's rice harvest this year is expected to total 9.91 million
metric tons, down from 10.7 million metric tons in 1987.
   But rice prices, which are set by the government and subsidized
under Japan's Food Control System, will not be affected, ministry
officials said.
   Japan's rice stockpiles of about 2 million tons likely will make
it unnecessary to import the staple to meet the 300,000-ton to
400,000-ton shortfall, ministry officials said.

   A quadruple killer called himself ``a
sacrificial lamb'' of the legal system as he was executed in the
electric chair for murdering a hitchhiker 13 years ago in a robbery
that netted $12 and a watch.
   Jeffrey Joseph Daugherty, 33, was executed Monday for the death
of one of four women he was convicted of killing during a three-week
crime spree in two states.
   He was the nation's second person executed in five days and 103rd
since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 decision allowing states to
resume executions. Florida has put to death 19 people since it
resumed executions in 1979.
   In a final statement, Daugherty criticized the legal system and
told fellow death row inmates to keep their hope alive.
   ``I hope with all my heart I will be the last sacrificial lamb of
a system that is not just, and all these people know it is not
just,'' Daugherty said. ``The executions serve no purpose.''
   Daugherty's face was covered by a black mask before a hooded man
threw the switch that sent 2,000 volts of electric current through
his body.
   His execution came minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4
against halting it.
   A small group of demonstrators opposing capital punishment,
including actress Margot Kidder, and a group supporting executions,
stood watch outside the Florida State Prison. Ms. Kidder charged
Daugherty's execution was politically motivated.
   ``This is the night before the election. They are using people's
lives for political gain and that's the obscenity,'' Ms. Kidder said.
   Daugherty was sentenced to death for murdering Lavonne Patricia
Sailer on March 1, 1976, in a Brevard County dump. He shot her five
times, stole her clothes, her watch and $12 hidden in her shoe.
   He was under three life imprisonment sentences for the slayings
of Betty Campbell, a pizzeria co-owner in Edgewater; Carmen Abrams,
a grocery store employee in Hammock; and Elizabeth Shanks, a
convenience store clerk in Hollidaysburg, Pa.
   Earlier Monday, Daugherty received a surprise visit from his
father, also named Jeffrey Daugherty, who arrived from Michigan. The
inmate also talked with his ex-wife and his two young children, said
Bob Macmaster, a spokesman for the state Corrections Department.
   All three Florida killings were committed within a week, shortly
after Daugherty, and his girlfriend, Bonnie Jean Heath, left
Michigan.
   In exchange for her testimony, Ms. Heath was allowed to plead
guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder in the killing of
Ms. Campbell and drew a 25-year sentence.
   On Thursday, Donald Gene Franklin, 37, who was put to death by
injection in Texas for the 1975 abduction-slaying of a nurse.

   Republican nominee George Bush said he felt
nervous as he voted today in his adopted home state of Texas, where
he ended his presidential campaign telling voters the election is a
referendum on a ``philosophy, a way of life.''
   The vice president and his wife, Barbara, voted in a hotel
conference room which had been set up as a polling place. The couple
then visited a local Republican headquarters to talk to people
working to get out the vote.
   Emerging from the voting booth, Bush was asked how he felt.
``Nervous ... everytime I vote here, I feel nervous,'' he said.
Asked about the outcome, he replied, ``No predictions.''
   At the GOP headquarters, Bush personally made a half-dozen
telephone calls. ``No, I'm not kidding,'' he told one person who
apparently expressed skepticism that Bush was on the line. ``Having
done all the hard work, now the key is to get the vote out,'' he
said.
   The vice president also showed off his French to a reporter from
France. ``Je peux parler un peu de francais,'' he said, explaining
he could speak the language a little. He added he felt ``tres
heureux, aujourd'hui,'' or ``very happy, today.''
   Bush told reporters he was ``very glad'' the campaign was over.
He planned a ``relaxed family day'' with ``a lot of exercise.'' He
planned to watch election returns on television with family members
and friends at his home in a Houston condominium-hotel complex.
   Bush wrapped up his campaign Monday with a final swing through
Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. He attended a raucus rally Monday
evening at the Galleria shopping mall where country stars Loretta
Lynn, Crystal Gayle and Mo Bandy entertained several thousand fans.
   Today's election is ``more than just a referendum on peace and
prosperity,'' Bush told the crowd.
   ``It's a referendum on a philosophy, a way of life that's well
and alive right here deep in the heart of Texas,'' he said.
   In a half-hour paid TV advertisment Monday night, the Republican
presidential nominee summed up the themes of his campaign and said
rival Michael Dukakis ``has no experience in national security
affairs.''
   ``I don't believe we can take a risk on an issue as important as
our national security,'' he said on the ad broadcast on the three
major networks right after Dukakis aired a half-hour spot of his own.
   Later, a soft-speaking Bush talked to viewers for a few minutes
at the end of the half-hour commercial that featured biographical
and campaign scenes set to music and narration, as well as an
endorsement by President Reagan and various Bush family members.
   ``I respect my opponent, I admire his devotion to family, and I
appreciate his decision to enter public service,'' Bush said. ``But
I do believe we are guided by fundamentally different philosophies,
a great divide, an honest difference of opinion on which approach
will lead America in the '90s stronger and more secure than ever.''
   Bush also echoed President Reagan's 1980 campaign line by saying,
``If you elect me president you will be better off four years from
now than you are today.''
   The ad made no mention of Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, whose qualifications have been an issue in the campaign.
   Bush appeared in a jovial mood Monday as nationwide polls showed
him holding his lead over Dukakis.
   Accompanied by his top campaign advisers, Bush spent the final
campaign day addressing rallies in a suburb of Detroit, in rural
Ashland, Ohio, and in St. Louis.
   While calling on voters to reject the ``failed liberal policies
of the past,'' Bush also seemed in a reflective mood as he talked
about what the campaign meant to him and what he sees ahead.
   ``Sometimes there's ups,'' he said. ``Sometimes there's downs.
Sometimes you get written off by all the great experts and sometimes
you bounce back.
   ``But I'll tell you where you get your strength, you get your
strength from travelling around the United States of America and
meeting and visiting with and listening to the heartbeat that comes
from the American people themselves.''
   Bush said he was confident that the negativism of the campaign
would soon be behind him.
   ``What I will do is trust the good judgment of the American
people who immediately shift gears and start looking to the
future,'' he said in an interview with radio reporters.

   James Chandler, whose name is on the ballot
today for re-election as a state representative, has been asking
people not to vote for him.
   Chandler is serving his third term in New Hampshire's House and
the Concord Republican initially decided to seek re-election. But
when House Clerk Carl Peterson announced his retirement, Chandler
decided he'd rather have that job _ a full-time post he held
previously.
   The only hitch was that Peterson's announcement came too late for
Chandler to drop his name from the ballot.
   So Chandler, 57, has taken down his signs, run no ads and
encouraged people not to vote for him. His is one of 10 names on the
ballot for five at-large seats from Concord.
   State representatives will elect Peterson's successor in
December, and Chandler knows he could lose his House seat and still
not get the clerk's job back.
   ``But it's not fair to hedge your bets,'' he said. If he became
clerk and left the House, it would cost Concord the price of a
special election.

   Fearful that one of the longest ballots in
state history would create long lines at the ballot booth, hundreds
of San Francisco voters crowded the registrar of voter's office to
request last-minute absentee ballots.
   About 25 percent or 93,000 of the city's voters requested
absentee ballots, according to Acting Registrar Germaine Wong, who
said Monday that she expects about 75 percent of those to be
returned.
   A record number of voters are resorting to absentee ballots to
avoid the crunch at polling places today. The Field Institute said
the phenomenon may mean that some results of some close races ``may
not be known for days and possibly weeks'' after Election Day.
   Absentee ballots take longer to process because the signatures
often must be verified by hand.
   A steady stream of voters poured out of the registrar's office
Monday and snaked through the rotunda of City Hall, confident that
they would save time in the long run.
   But with the counter finally in view after a 45-minute wait,
David Bartholomew, 33, was having second thoughts.
   ``I think now I've learned my lesson and next year I'll send in
for it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Law Firm And Shell Oil Accused of Conspiracy in Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A $66 million lawsuit has been filed charging that
a law firm and its major client, Shell Oil Co., conspired to cover
up years of pollution at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal.
   Travelers Insurance Co., which insured Shell's arsenal operations
from 1952 to 1975, charged that the oil giant failed for decades to
tell underwriters about environmental destruction at the chemical
production site north of Stapleton International Airport.
   The complex lawsuit, filed Nov. 1 in California, is unusual in
its accusation that the Denver law firm Holme Roberts conspired with
a client.
   The Army, which leased arsenal space to Shell, sued the oil giant
in December 1983 to force it to join the $2 billion cleanup of the
27-square-mile facility. Shell hired Holme Roberts as its attorneys
in the case.
   One month later, Travelers agreed to pay 55 percent _ $16 million
_ of Shell's costs of defending itself against that suit.
   Travelers is asking for return of the $16 million plus $50
million in punitive damages.
   Travelers said Shell ``knowingly and intentionally released
pollutants into the environment since commencement of its operations
at the arsenal in 1952.'' It also charged that Holme Roberts learned
of the extent of Shell's pollution at the arsenal while representing
Shell.
   A spokesman for Holme Roberts said the lawsuit was ``totally
without foundation,'' and a Shell corporate spokeswoman said the
accusations were ``totally without merit.''
   In a separate case, Shell is suing Travelers and 250 other
insurance companies to force them to share the entire cost of the
cleanup bill. That trial is in its second year in San Mateo County
(Calif.) Superior Court.
   Travelers charged in its lawsuit that Shell and Holme Roberts are
using Travelers-financed evidence from the Army case against
Travelers itself in the California insurance trial.

   Underdog Michael Dukakis ended his marathon run for
the presidency today with a cross-country journey home, predicting
that he'd surprise the pollsters with an upset victory over
Republican George Bush.
   Arriving sleepless from a nightlong flight from California that
included stops in Iowa and Michigan, the Democratic nominee was
publicly optimistic as he cast his ballot at a hometown housing
project.
   ``I voted for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen and I'm proud of
it,'' he said leaving the polling booth with his wife, Kitty, and
their three children. His mother, Euterpe Dukakis, raised her hand
in a V for victory sign.
   At a Boston airport welcome-home rally, Dukakis told his audience
to expect the unexpected.
   ``I think tonight we're not only going to surprise a few people,
but we're going to be doing the celebrating,'' Dukakis told several
hundred cheering supporters. ``It's been an incredible experience.''
   He was equally feisty at a rain-swept rally at the Detroit
airport, his last stop before Boston.
   ``We always knew this would be a tough, competitive race,'' he
said. ``Democrats win tough, competitive races. ... Let's go out
there and make sure that we're the ones who are popping the
champagne corks and preparing for a new era of American greatness.''
   Earlier, about 3,000 partisans braved sub-freezing temperatures
to greet Dukakis before dawn in Des Moines, Iowa, in the state where
the Massachusetts governor began his bid for the White House 20
months ago.
   ``There is so much we can do working together, just so long as we
remember that we are one nation, one community, one people,'' he
told them.
   The rallies were part of a grueling, virtually non-stop schedule
Dukakis has kept up since the weekend in his uphill bid to defeat
Bush.
   ``I come away from all of this even more optimistic about the
future of this great country of ours than when I started,'' he told
supporters before flying to Detroit and then home to Boston.
   Dukakis began the campaign's last trip back across the country
after spending a final day in California.
   ``Don't let them tell you this campaign is over,'' Dukakis said
Monday night in a speech to more than 10,000 supporters in Los
Angeles before heading home. ``It won't be over until the people of
California have their say. ... I know this race is within our grasp
both here and across this country.''
   Dukakis told his California audience they may hear news reports
calling the race in Bush's favor based on exit polls in Eastern
states. But he urged them to work until polls close in the West.
   ``It's yours and the hands across America that will win this
election for us,'' Dukakis said.
   He also took another swipe at Bush's selection of Indiana Sen.
Dan Quayle as his running mate by noting that the GOP nominee did
not mention Quayle during a half-hour network commercial broadcast
on election eve.
   ``I've heard of the secret ballot. This is the first time I've
heard of the secret candidate,'' Dukakis told the star-studded rally
that included performers Ted Danson, Chevy Chase, Kris
Kristofferson, Stephen Stills, Lloyd Bridges, Sally Field, Hal
Linden and Rob Lowe.
   The trip home, which began in California and includes stops in
Iowa and Michigan, will end a 8,500-mile non-stop campaign journey
that began Saturday in Colorado and that by its end will bring
Dukakis to 11 cities in nine states.
   In that time, Dukakis traveled from the West Coast to the Midwest
back West and then across the country one last time on the way home
to cast his ballot late this morning in Brookline, Mass., and await
the results.
   Polls have shown Dukakis closing on Bush but still trailing the
vice president, particularly in the Electoral College count, which
heavily favors the vice president.
   But the Massachusetts governor and aides remained upbeat to the
end of the race, the self-described marathon Dukakis began some 20
months ago as a virtual unknown campaigning in snowy Iowa.
   ``We're here tonight, but tomorrow we're going to slam dunk Bush
and Quayle,'' Dukakis told a boisterous rally at Pauley Pavilion,
the storied basketball arena at UCLA.
   ``The race is closer and it's getting closer every hour,'' the
Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis traveled overnight Sunday to campaign Monday morning in
Ohio and Missouri and then flew back to the West Coast for rallies
in San Francisco and Los Angeles before heading back East.
   In San Francisco he spoke to about 30,000 people, pausing for
several minutes at the end of his speech, as he did later in Los
Angeles, to enjoy the cheers.
   Pauley Pavilion at UCLA was the scene of the second and final
debate between Bush and Dukakis _ a contest in which Dukakis was
widely perceived as the loser in a battle he so much needed to win.
   ``I think California is going to lock George Bush right out of
the White House,'' he told the outdoor rally in San Francisco and
the indoor event in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis' long shot strategy is dependent on the race coming down
to California and its 47 electoral votes _ the largest Election Day
prize.
   As the race closed, Dukakis did something he did few times during
the lengthy campaign _ discuss his vision of America.
   ``America is not just a place,'' he said in a solemn tone. ``It's
not just a piece of land or just another country. It's the noblest
experiment ever undertaken on this planet. It's a symbol of what we
human beings can do when we unleash the will of our people, our
nation and our country.''

   The mother of a baby taken from her arms
at a hospital by a woman posing as a nurse says she has no animosity
toward her son's kidnapper.
   ``I don't hate this woman. I don't know why she did it. I know
she's sick and if there were other people involved in it, they need
help, too,'' Annette Thomas-Jones said. She said the ``nurse'' told
her the baby had to be weighed.
   The baby's father, Willie Jones, issued a new appeal Monday for
leads as the reward for the return of 11-day-old Christopher Michael
Anthony Jones went up by another $10,000.
   So far, $26,500 has been offered for information leading to
recovery of the baby. The $10,000 was put up by the nationally
syndicated ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' said Lynn Matthews,
director of public relations at Doctors Hospital, where the baby was
abducted Nov. 1.
   Two hotlines had received more than 300 calls by Monday,
according to spokesmen for the Little Rock Police Department and the
hospital.
   The infant was born six weeks prematurely Oct. 29.
   ``I appeal to the community to continue to help us by responding
to the composite (drawing), and don't worry about making a
mistake,'' said the father.
   ``If you see someone who fits the description of the composite,
please respond to it. If it is a mistake, the person will
understand,'' he said.
   Mrs. Jones again asked the abductor to consider the infant's
fragile condition and return him to medical care.
   No solid leads have been received, according to Lt. R.L. ``Bert''
Jenkins, spokesman for the Little Rock police.
   ``All these leads were checked out and they're dead ends,''
Jenkins said.
   Jenkins said the police hotline had received more than 200 calls
since it was established last week and a special number at Doctors
Hospital had 114 calls by Monday.
   The public is being asked by police to watch for neighbors and
acquaintances with newborn children, especially if those people had
not been seen with babies or were not pregnant before the abduction.

<HEAD>Woman Dies Of Beating After Buying Grandchildren Christmas Presents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman has died two days after she was
beaten by robbers trying to steal $11 she intended to use to buy
Christmas presents for her grandchildren.
   Shirley Lockett, 47, died Monday at University Hospital,
apparently from injuries she suffered Saturday in the attack in a
discount store parking lot, Jefferson County Deputy Coroner Stan
Pitts said.
   The coroner's office said the death is being treated as a
homicide. No one has been charged.
   Mrs. Lockett's oldest daughter, Marcella Agee, 26, said her
mother said she was attacked when she got out of her car. She said
two men tried to steal her purse, which contained the $11, and also
might have been after her Cadillac.
   ``She said she was getting out of her car when two men started
hitting her in the face with brass knuckles. She said that some
other people in the parking lot then chased the men off'' before
they got either the purse or car, Mrs. Agee said.
   Mrs. Lockett passed out after the attack, but regained
consciousness and drove five blocks to her home. Her family took her
to Cooper Green Hospital and she was transferred to University
Hospital because of the severity of her injuries, said University
spokesman Hank Black. She later lost consciousness at the hospital
and died.

   A federal judge says he imposed relatively short
sentences on an Iranian father and son for trying to smuggle missile
parts to their homeland because of the father's age and poor health
and the son's stupidity.
   The United States has prosecuted at least 46 cases of arms
smuggling or attempted arms smuggling to Iran since 1981, when the
country's 8-year war with neighboring Iraq began.
   Ahmad Modarressi, 64, was sentenced Monday to 14 months in prison
and his son, Majid, 30, to six months in prison by U.S. District
Judge Mark L. Wolf.
   The judge said mitigating factors included the elder Modarressi's
belief that the U.S. government was interested in improving
relations with Iran.
   But Wolf characterized the younger Modarressi as ``extremely
naive, perhaps more accurately described as extremely stupid.''
   ``The circumstances do tend to diminish the moral culpability of
the defendant, though not his legal culpability,'' Wolf said. ``The
preconceived notion of the type of person who would engage in
international arms smuggling fits a certain profile. This profile
had very little to do with Majid Modarressi.
   ``The defendant Majid Modarressi's stupid behavior in this case
reached a level I've never encountered in criminal matters. By the
end of the case, he seems more like a cartoon character than a
menace to society.''
   Among the son's gaffes, Wolf said, were suggesting a $60 million
illegal deal over the telephone to an unknown Raytheon Co. worker,
not knowing what a TOW antitank missile was and inquiring about
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles simply because he had heard them
mentioned in a TV news report about Afghanistan.
   Wolf said the elder Modarressi had a fuzzy understanding of the
Iran-Contra scandal and the trip to Tehran reportedly made by former
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
   ``I am influenced by the fact that he apparently had the honest
belief that while export of these arms was illegal, the United
States wanted to sell these arms to Iran to open channels for
exports to that country,'' the judge said.
   Ahmad Modarressi's sentence includes 10 months he has already
served. He is an Iranian national and could be deported after his
release.
   Majid Modarressi's sentence is 189 days, the amount of time he
has already served. He will be required to perform 500 hours of
community service in Cincinnati, where he has been an unemployed
architect and has an American wife and 4-year-old daughter.
   The father and son were accused of violating the U.S. Arms Export
Control Act by attempting to buy microwave tubes for the radar of
the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system and sell them to Iran.
   The elder Modarressi pleaded guilty during their trial and his
son was convicted Oct. 26 after a 19-day trial.
   The case stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a Customs
Service agent posed as an employee of Raytheon, the Lexington-based
firm that makes the Hawk system, and recorded conversations with the
Modarressis.
   Although a truce in the Iran-Iraq war was announced Aug. 20, U.S.
officials said Iran has maintained its effort to obtain spare parts
for its military hardware, the bulk of which was bought from the
United States by the American-backed government of the shah before
the 1979 Islamic revolution.

   A 59-year-old insurance salesman has been cleared
of charges that he caused a fatal accident by slicking a street with
motor oil to stop local drag racers.
   A jury in state Supreme Court acquitted Andrew Romano of Queens
of second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment in the death
of 20-year-old Kenneth Miret of Queens.
   Miret was killed when his car spun into a violent crash while
speeding Nov. 3, 1987.
   It was alleged that Miret's car struck oil that Romano spread on
the roadway after neighbors repeatedly complained about drag racers.
   On the witness stand, Romano denied pouring oil onto the street.
   He could have received up to 15 years in prison if convicted.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Dan Quayle, saying
``Well, we got one sure vote,'' cast his ballot today in his
hometown where he ended his occasionally rocky campaign for the vice
presidency.
   Returning to Indiana Monday night, Quayle told about 2,000
supporters nearby Fort Wayne that he was ``finally at home'' after a
campaign that began when he was picked for the No. 2 slot at the
Republican convention in August.
   ``Well, we got one sure vote,'' Quayle said as he emerged from
the Huntington County Courthouse where he and his wife, Marilyn,
voted.
   ``Two,'' said Mrs. Quayle, adding it was a ``very exciting'' day
for the couple.
   Before voting, Quayle went to the family dentist for a routine
check-up and teeth-cleaning. Aides said the visit to the dentist has
been an election day ritual since Quayle was elected to the House of
Representatives in 1976.
   As he walked from the dentist to the courthouse, elementary
school children cheered Quayle, who was raised in the town.
   Huntington also was the scene of one of Quayle's most trying
campaign moments: a tension-filled confrontation with reporters who
questioned him about his past the day after he accepted the vice
presidential nomination.
   At the rally Monday night, Quayle did not mention accusations
that he had used family influence to get a slot in the Indiana
National Guard to avoid the draft during the Vietnam war.
   But he said, ``There have been weeks of wild exhilaration along
with personal testing, and we knew you were there.''
   Quayle, seeking to become the first Indiana native to become vice
president since Thomas R. Marshall served under President Woodrow
Wilson from 1913-1921, was praised by several state party figures as
a political survivor.
   ``You have been subjected to the white-hot test of politics and
the national press, and you stood the test,'' said Rep. Dan Coates,
R-Ind.
   The rally took on the look of a political convention, with a huge
wooden replica of the American flag used as a backdrop, a videotaped
narrative about Quayle and a series of speeches by gubernatorial
candidate John Mutz and his running mate, Steve Goldsmith.
   ``Fellow Hoosiers, I've been in 38 states and made more than 235
stops,'' Quayle said. ``For the last 10 weeks, I've felt like I've
been strapped to the back of an Indy 500 car. But now I can see the
checkered flag, and with your help my friends, George Bush and I
will be seeing you in the winner's circle.''
   Quayle, accompanied by his wife and his three children, Tucker,
14, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 9, dined with his mother and father,
James and Corinne, and spent the night at their home.
   The senator also scheduled a visit today with Martha Pulliam, his
97-year-old grandmother, at the Methodist Nursing Home in
Indianapolis, before returning to Washington to await tonight's
election returns.
   Quayle had been besieged by questions from news organizations
about the circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the Indiana
National Guard at the height of the Vietnam war in 1969 and the
question of whether he benefited by undue influence in getting
admitted into the Indiana University law school with a ``C'' average
on undergraduate work at Depauw University.
   Quayle has said that his campaign went much more smoothly once
the questions were laid aside.
   Campaigning earlier Monday in Roanoke, Va., Quayle said Americans
must ``say good night'' to Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis if they want to savethe changes wrought during President
Reagan's eight years in office.
   During a rally at an aiport hangar in Roanoke, nestled in the
Blue Ridge Mountains, he declared: ``Let me say to the citizens of
Virginia: Michael Dukakis is not on your side.''
   The senator said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' about the GOP's
election prospects and said he was satisfied with the way he handled
his role as Bush's running mate.

<HEAD>13 Hostages Return Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALE, Maldives (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen hostages returned to this island
nation today, recalling their 56-hour ordeal at the hands of
mercenaries fleeing a failed coup attempt. Hundreds of people
greeted them.
   ``It is a second life for us,'' said V.A. Vincent, second officer
of the cargo ship Progress Light, which was hijacked by the fleeing
Sri Lankan mercenaries Friday.
   ``We had lost all hope. The mercenaries were very ruthless,''
Vincent said.
   Maj. Mohammed Zahir of the National Security Service, the
Maldivian national militia, said seven bodies were found on the ship
after the mercenaries gave up Sunday to two Indian warships 60 miles
off the Sri Lankan coast.
   ``All of the victims were hostages shot by the mercenaries,''
Zahir said.
   Fourteen hostages, including Transport Minister Admed Mujithaba,
were flown to India on Sunday to be treated for injuries suffered
before the mercenaries surrendered.
   Officials said 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in Thursday's
attempted overthrow of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The
mercenaries fled after Indian paratroopers assisted Maldivian forces.
   Hundreds of people crowded the half-mile long jetty in Male as
the Indian frigate Godavari arrived. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom
greeted the returning hostages.
   At least 65 mercenaries or supporters, their hands bound, were
counted by reporters who went aboard the Godavari. The mercenaries
were to be questioned by authorities.
   Zahir said all those captured were Sri Lankan Tamils with the
exception of two Maldivians. He identified the Maldivians as
Abdullah Luthufi, an aide to former President Ibrahim Nasir, and
businessman Sagar Nasir.
   Nasir has denied involvement in the failed coup.
   Maldivian officials, including Foreign Minister Fathulla Jameel,
have accused Luthufi of recruiting the mercenaries in Sri Lanka
where Tamil guerrillas have waged a 5-year separatist war against
the Colombo government.
   Luthufi told reporters the coup was planned by members of the
People's Liberation of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil militant group in Sri
Lanka.
   ``I met Uma Maheswaran several times in Colombo,'' Luthufi said,
referring to the militant group's founder and leader. ``He provided
the men and the arms.''
   Luthufi said Maheswaran feared his group would be driven out of
Sri Lanka by rival Tamil militias.
   Anthony Jesudasan, a Tamil from Sri Lanka, said he and his
colleagues were informed that they were going to attack the Maldives
only after they set asail.
   He refused to disclose the port from where they sailed but said
two trawlers full of mercenaries were involved in the attack.
   Indian naval officers recovered Chinese-made T-56 rifles,
Soviet-made rocket-propelled grenades and carbines from the
mercenaries, the Indian Foreign Ministry reported in New Delhi.
   Earlier reports by Indian and Maldivian officials put the total
number of hostages at 27, of whom four were reported killed, and the
number of mercenaries aboard the Progress Light at 46. There was no
immediate explanation for the discrepancy, but today's figures were
based on head counts and body counts.

<TEXT>
   Sociologist Morris Janowitz, known for his work on
race, war and urban violence, has died at the age of 69 after a long
bout with Parkinson's disease.
   Janowitz, former chairman of the University of Chicago's
sociology department, died Monday, university spokesman Bill Harms
said. He had retired last year.
   Janowitz was internationally known for both his teaching and
writing.
   In 1950, he co-authored ``The Dynamics of Prejudice'' with Bruno
Bettelheim, a major work that provided ``new perspectives on the
problem of racial and ethnic prejudice,'' said Charles Bidwell, the
sociology department's current chairman.
   He also wrote ``The Professional Soldier,'' on the military and
its relationship with society, and ``Sociology and the Military
Establishment.''
   ``The Last Half Century: Societal Change and Politics in
America,'' published in 1978, received the Laing Prize, the highest
honor bestowed on books by University of Chicago faculty put out by
the school's press.
   In 1973, Janowitz was named the Lawrence A. Kimpton Distinguished
Service Professor. He received the Distinguished Scholarship Award
from the American Sociological Association in 1985.
   Born in Paterson, N.J., Janowitz attended Washington Square
College as an undergraduate and received his doctorate in 1948 from
the University of Chicago.
   He taught at Chicago from 1947 to 1951, then moved to the
University of Michigan, where he stayed until 1961, when he was
appointed a full professor at Chicago.
   Survivors include his wife, Gayle and two daughters, Rebecca and
Naomi. Funeral arrangements were pending.

   A 6-year-old girl has died four days after
she was shot in the head while her father held her and her sister
hostage, authorities said.
   Latasha Shoulders died Monday at the University of Mississippi
Medical Center of a gunshot wound to the head, Hinds County Coroner
Robert Martin said.
   Her 8-year-old sister, Dawn, died Thursday, the day of the
shootings, also of a shot to the head.
   ``You couldn't find any better kids,'' the girls' uncle, William
Harkless, said after learning of Latasha's death.
   The sisters were shot while their father, 37-year-old Emanuel
Shoulders Jr., allegedly held them hostage in the attic of Harkless'
Jackson home.
   Police had been attempting to serve Shoulders with an arrest
warrant accusing him of raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter. When
police arrived at Harkless' house, Shoulders refused to answer the
door.
   About an hour later, officers heard what they thought were shots
inside the house. Police went in and found the children with their
wounded father lying on top of them.
   Shoulders, believed to have shot himself in the head, has been in
critical condition at Hinds General Hospital. Hospital officials
would not release his condition Monday night.
   Shoulders' wife, Francis, had confronted him by telephone
Thursday morning with suspicions that he had sexually molested her
12-year-old daughter. She said she found a note written by Shoulders
in his wallet describing what he had done to the girl.
   After the conversation, Shoulders left his job and took the two
sisters out of Lake Elementary School. Mrs. Shoulders left her job
to get her 12-year-old out of school and went to police to file the
rape charge against her husband.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `There was ...,' with 2 grafs to UPDATE with

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Bill Hoest, whose award-winning comic
strip ``The Lockhorns,'' has had Leroy and Loretta Lockhorn
quarreling for two decades on the nation's funny pages, has died at
age 62.
   Hoest, of Lloyd Neck, died Monday of lymphoma at New York Medical
Center.
   ``The Lockhorns,'' which celebrated its 20th anniversary in
September, is syndicated to more than 500 newspapers worldwide.
   Hoest also produced the comic strips ``What A Guy!'' and ``Agatha
Crumm'' for King Features Syndicate, the panel ``Bumper Snickers''
for The Enquirer and ``Howard Huge'' for Parade magazine.
   ``Mr. Hoest's work will continue under the creative management of
Mrs. Hoest, who has been involved with the strip for many years,''
Ted Hannah, a spokesman for King Features, said today.
   Hannah said several artists had worked with Hoest on the three
King Features strips, and the cartoonist was at least six weeks
ahead on his strips and had a large file of gags for future use.
   When Hoest created the Lockhorns in 1968, the couple began their
marriage with Leroy's retort: ``The boss's wife wants to know what
was in the recipe you served tonight ... so she can tell her
doctor.''
   ``The Lockhorns'' was named best syndicated panel of 1976 and
1980 by the National Cartoonists Society Award. This year, Hoest was
elected president of the society, the world's largest organization
of professional cartoonists.
   ``Agatha Crumm,'' begun in 1977, is a parody of the business
world that features Ms. Crumm, who has a computer-like mind and a
consuming passion for money.
   In 1979, Hoest became cartoon editor of Parade, where his panel
``Howard Huge,'' starring a lovable Saint Bernard, appears each week.
   Hoest was born Feb. 7, 1926, in Newark, N.J. After graduating
from Montclair High School, he served two years in the Navy and then
studied advertising and art at Cooper Union Art School in Manhattan.
   Hoest worked three years at Norcross Greeting Card Co. and in
1951 became a freelance artist.
   He is survived by his wife, Bunny; his mother, nine children and
stepchildren, and grandchildren. A private memorial service is to be
held Friday.

<TEXT>
   A swarm of killer bees, also known as
Africanized bees, was found last week on a ship docked in Tampa, the
chief of the Florida Department of Agriculture's apiary inspection
bureau says.
   The swarm found Oct. 31 was destroyed by U.S. Department of
Agriculture personnel and samples were sent to a laboratory, where
they were identified as Africanized bees, Laurence Cutts said Monday.
   It was the fourth colony of killer bees found on a ship in a
Florida port in the past two years, Cutts said.
   Another swarm of bees was found last week on a crane next to a
ship at Fort Lauderdale, but officials believe those were European
bees, the type used in this country to make honey.
   Killer bees, descendants of African bees which escaped from a
research project in Brazil in 1956, are extremely belligerent.
Although their stings are no more potent that other bees, they
attack in numbers instead of singly and have caused a number of
deaths in South America.
   Cutts does not expect the killer bees to become established in
Florida by entrance through ports.
   If one swarm escaped detection at a port and entered the state,
it would become genetically diluted with other strains. However, he
said, if two swarms were in the same area, they could begin breeding
and spread throughout the state.
   ``Therefore, it is desirable that we destroy all Africanized bees
brought in,'' he said.
   He said finding the bees on ships from Central and South America
is ``going to be more and more a common occurrence.''
   The bees have been slowly migrating northward since their 1956
escape and have reached the southern part of Mexico. They are
expected to reach Texas by 1990 but are not expected to reach
Florida for three to five more years, Cutts said.

<HEAD>Two Strikes Protest Plans To Close Lenin Shipyard</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with two strikes, new quotes from Walesa. No

<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at two Gdansk shipyards went on
strike today to demand that the government drop plans to close the
Lenin Shipyard. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called the strikes ``a
warning to the authorities.''
   Walesa said the strikes defied his banned trade federation and
prove he is losing control of Poland's restive workers. He called
for moderation and indicated he might be willing to conduct talks
with authorities even before the shipyard question is resolved.
   His statement appeared to be a retreat from his earlier demand
that the Lenin Shipyard closure be suspended before the talks begin.
   Speaking to reporters after strikes began at two smaller Gdansk
shipyards, Walesa said he had urged the workers not to strike but
they defied him.
   ``This situation indicates that Lech Walesa and his group are
losing control. It is a warning for myself and a warning to the
authorities,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to go on strike. I want to settle the problems of
the round table and the Solidarity trade union, not to get the
country deeper into crisis,'' Walesa said.
   The government said the nation's largest shipyard, the birthplace
of Solidarity, will be closed in December because it is losing
money. Solidarity said the closure is a politically motivated
attempt to cripple the movement.
   Some workers at the Wisla Shipyard and the Repair Shipyard today
declared strikes in a show of unity to demand preservation of the
Lenin yard. Earlier, Walesa led more than 6,000 workers in a rally
at the Lenin yard opposing the government closure order.
   Wisla Shipyard management would not confirm any work stoppage,
but reporters saw banners at the yard and were told by strike
committee leader Jan Stanecki that nearly half the 1,000 employees
were refusing to work.
   Walesa said about 500 workers were striking at Repair Shipyard.
   He also stopped short of proclaiming a nationwide ``strike
alert,'' which he had threatened Sunday.
   In addition to demanding preservation of the Lenin Shipyard, the
workers who went on strike today called for the rehiring of those
fired for striking in August. They also called for reinstatement of
Solidarity, which was created in August 1980 and banned after a
December 1981 military crackdown.
   After today's rally at the Lenin Shipyard, Walesa said: ``The
Lenin Shipyard is not going on strike for the time being. We are not
even announcing an alert. We are just waiting for reaction all over
the country. We are ready to execute any maneuver, at any moment.''
   On Sunday, he threatened to order a nationwide ``strike alert''
at today's rally. Instead, workers approved a resolution urging a
struggle to preserve ``the cradle of reforms and cradle of
Solidarity,'' Walesa said.
   The state-run news media has accused Walesa of blocking the start
of talks on the country's future. Communist authorities agreed to
the talks in exchange for Walesa's helping end Poland's most serious
labor unrest in seven years.
   As a condition for Solidarity's participation in the talks,
Walesa has demanded the scuttling of plans to close the shipyard and
the rehiring of workers fired because of the August strikes.
   Poland's inflation rate is running about 60 percent and workers
have demanded wage increases to protect their buying power. The
country also faces a foreign debt of more than $39 billion.

   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq today said his
country was willing to begin repatriating sick and wounded prisoners
from its 8-year-old war with Iran, if Iran agrees to do the same.
   His statement seemed to clear the way for a prisoner exchange,
following Iran's earlier offer to release all sick and wounded
prisoners as well as civilian detainees ``on a reciprocal basis.''
   Aziz, speaking to reporters after a meeting with officials of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said the repatriation
would apply to 411 Iranians and 1,115 Iraqis who have been
identified by the Red Cross.
   A Red Cross spokeswoman, Francoise Derron, confirmed that number
had been registered, but said ``since we have not been able to visit
all POWs we may assume there are more'' ill and injured prisoners.
   The Red Cross has registered a total of 50,182 Iraqi prisoners in
Iran and 19,284 Iranians in Iraq. The Red Cross has estimated the
number of additional, unregistered prisoners is 20,000 to 30,000 on
each side.
   The standard Red Cross practice is to register and interview
every prisoner to make sure his repatriation is voluntary.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, already has offered
to release all sick and wounded prisoners as well as civilian
detainees ``on a reciprocal basis.''
   Aziz said the repatriation should be begun by each side at the
same time.
   Aziz said Iraq wanted an immediate repatriation of sick and
wounded prisoners ``to put an end to their suffering and their
families' anxiety after the cessation of active hostilities'' and to
comply with the Geneva Convention governing POWs.
   He said it should not be taken by Iran ``as a pretext to block
the comprehensive exchange operation in accordance with the Geneva
Convention, as more than 100,000 POWs from both sides still suffer
from captivity'' despite a cease-fire that began Aug. 20.
   The Red Cross has offered to oversee an exchange of prisoners..
   The question of a prisoner exchange has been a problem in the
U.N.-mediated peace talks. The talks are aimed at consolidating the
cease-fire and peace in the region.
   Iraq has called for an immediate exchange of all prisoners
independent of the peace talks. Iraq has said it would release its
more than 30,000 prisoners right away if Iran would reciprocate.
   But Iran has linked a full-scale prisoner exchange to agreement
on a withdrawal of troops, saying this would be under the terms of
the U.N. Security Council's cease-fire Resolution 598.
   Last week, Aziz charged that Iran was delaying a prisoner
exchange. Velayati accused Iraq of using humanitarian issues as a
pretext for delaying withdrawal of its troops from Iranian territory.
   In an interview Monday with Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, Velayati claimed no Iranian troops were left on Iraq
territory but said Iraqi forces were occupying more than 386 square
miles of Iranian territory.

<HEAD>Study Delves Into Hiring By Japanese Auto Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers have located their
U.S. plants in areas with few blacks, but they are not alone in the
practice, according to a new study.
   ``Industrial development specialists in state governments report
that they are often asked by American firms in a variety of
industries to eliminate from consideration plant sites in counties
with 30 percent or more black population,'' said the study to be
published in the next issue of the University of
California-Berkeley's California Management Review.
   The 18-month study by University of Michigan professors Robert E.
Cole and Donald R. Deskins Jr. used 1987 and 1988 industry
employment figures. Their calculations are based on the distance
deemed by the U.S. Census Bureau as a reasonable commute: 29 miles.
   ``If you look at most of these new plant ventures, they all seem
to be between 20 and 30 miles away from a black cluster,'' Deskins
said in an interview published in Tuesday's editions of the San
Francisco Examiner.
   Japanese companies, he said, ``seem to be working just within the
letter but not the spirit of the law.''
   The study found that the highest percentages of black employees
were at traditional ``Big Three'' auto plants, those that have
neither renovated nor been rebuilt since 1980 and are in the
greatest danger of closing.
   New General Motors plants have hired a work force that is 25.4
percent black, drawing from a population near the new plants that is
16.6 percent black, the study said. Ford and Chrysler have not built
U.S. plants since 1980.
   The NUMMI plant in Fremont, a joint venture between General
Motors and Toyota, has a greater percentage of black (28 percent)
and Hispanic (23 percent) employees than the surrounding area, the
study found.
   The authors contend that is evidence of the opportunity provided
to minorities by the auto industry and the United Auto Workers'
insistence that laid-off GM workers be the first hired as a
condition of the joint venture.

<HEAD>Vineyard, Nantucket Residents Debate Fate of Boston-based Ferry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, split
over limiting the tourism that supports their economies, squared off
at a public hearing over the rejection of a direct ferry link
between Boston and the resort islands.
   ``I live on Martha's Vineyard. I consider it a special place. But
that doesn't make me a special person,'' Sherman Goldstein, who owns
the Tisbury Inn, said Monday of the move widely viewed as an attempt
to limit tourist traffic.
   At a daylong Statehouse hearing, the joint Transportation
Committee heard comment on a bill introduced by state Sen. William
Q. MacLean Jr. that would strip the Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket Steamship Authority of some licensing powers.
   MacLean, who owns a house on Nantucket, filed the proposed
legislation after the three-member authority board rejected Oct. 20
a private catamaran service to the islands that carried 11,500
passengers between Boston and Martha's Vineyard on a trial basis
last summer.
   Opponents of the high-speed line sought by Bay State-Provincetown
Cruises said it would add to crowds and development problems on the
islands off southern Cape Cod. Defenders said direct access would
alleviate mammoth summer traffic problems on the Cape.
   ``Our streets are jammed,'' steamship authority Chairman Bernard
Grossman of Nantucket said. ``Downtown Nantucket in the three summer
months is like Filene's Basement (department store) between
Thanksgiving and Christmas.''
   MacLean initially sought to strip the authority of its right,
granted by legislation in 1960, to license private ferry service
between the mainland and two islands.
   But under an amendment added Monday, the bill would limit boat
sizes to from 300 to 500 passengers and would limit service to two
round trips daily on the Boston runs.
   The lively hearing prompted charges of elitism on Nantucket,
reports of a movement afoot to issue ``passports'' for year-round
Vineyard residents and Grossman's claim that many Nantucket tourists
arrive ``with $5 and a dirty shirt and don't change either.''
   ``The board of selectmen wants to revoke my citizenship there,''
MacLean, who has come under fire from some Nantucket residents for
proposing the legislation, said to some boos. ``Maybe I'll give it
back to them. I'm not an elitist.''
   Joseph G. Pallotta Jr., who heads Bay State-Provincetown Cruises,
said the Vineyard Spray carried 11,500 passengers from July-October,
less than 2 percent of the 2 million steamship authority passengers.
   He defended service on grounds that the 300-passenger catamaran
carried no cars, motorcycles or mopeds.
   ``The boat keeps thousands of cars off the Cape highways,'' he
added.

   An advertisement for a calculator featuring a
picture of President Reagan and a boast that the product can ``make
anyone a genius'' was not intended to be offensive, the firm that
created the ad said Tuesday.
   In the ad, Reagan's face appears under an Albert Einstein-like
mop of white hair.
   ``It's sort of a little chuckle, but I don't believe it's
offensive,'' said Jonathan Hill, manager of the Sharp Electronics
campaign for the advertising firm, Ayer and Barker.
   The agency has not received any complaints about the ad, he said.
   ``We of course have seen (the ad),'' said a spokesman for the
U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity, but he added there
will be no official complaint.
   Hill said the ad was ``produced for England, predominantly for
business people, who like (Reagan) in an affectionate way.''
   In the next two ads in the series, the same slogan and white hair
will be paired with the faces of a child and Eddie ``the Eagle''
Edwards, the British ski-jumper in the winter Olympics.

<TEXT>
   Bishop Jan Pasztor, one of only
four Roman Catholic prelates in Czechoslovakia, died Tuesday at the
age of 76.
   Pasztor, who was consecrated bishop of the Nitra Diocese in
western Slovakia in 1973, had been ill for some time, according to
the official CTK news agency.
   His death leaves 10 of Czechoslovakia's 13 Roman Catholic sees
without a bishop.
   In June, he attended the consecration of Jan Sokol as bishop and
apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Trnava, known as the
``Rome of Slovakia'' for its many historic churches.
   Vatican representative Archbishop Francesco Colasuonno presided
at the ceremony, attended by 15,000 believers, and issued strong
demands for more priests, religious education and bishops to fill
Czechoslovakia's nine empty sees.
   Negotiations between the Vatican and the Czechoslovak government
have always been thorny due to Prague's unwillingness to approve
clergymen proposed by the Vatican to become bishops.
   Apart from Sokol, who is in his mid-50s, all the incumbents are
over 75.
   Earlier this year, about 600,000 people signed a petition calling
for religious freedom and the appointment of new bishops.
   Sokol is in his mid-50s but the other bishops are over 75.
   About 60 percent of Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million people are
Catholics, church officials said.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin broke his
self-imposed seclusion Tuesday to visit the grave of his wife on the
sixth anniversary of her death.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and about 100 other friends and
relatives joined Begin for the 20-minute ceremony on the Mount of
Olives, where his wife, Aliza, is buried.
   Begin shook hands with well-wishers as he left the cemetery
walking arm-in-arm with his daughters, Hassia and Leah.
   ``I haven't seen you in a long time,'' Begin told friends.
``Thank you all very much for coming.''
   Begin, known for lively oratory while in politics, looked haggard
as he stood beside the grave with his family. Long gray hair
protruded from under the rim of his black hat.
   Uri Porat, head of Israel's broadcasting authority and a
long-time friend, said Begin's state of mind appeared improved.
   ``He seemed less indifferent than he once was,'' Porat said. ``He
looked good.''
   Begin, founder of the right-wing Likud bloc who rose to power in
1977, signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and shared a Nobel
Peace Prize with the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. He then
led Israel into a three-year war in Lebanon.
   Begin resigned in 1983, and aides explained the decision as an
outgrowth of his depression over the death of his wife in 1982 and
the loss of nearly 700 soldiers in Lebanon.
   Begin, who has lived as a recluse in his modest home on the edge
of the Jerusalem Forest since his resignation, never said why he
left office.
   His most recent public appearance was in July, when dozens of
supporters met him at his home to celebrate his 75th birthday.

   More than 1,000 people have died from AIDS in
Britain and Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said Tuesday.
   Another 68 cases were reported in these regions last month,
bringing the total to 1,862 cases, said the department. The number
of deaths from the disease climbed to 1,002 last month, it said.
   Health Minister David Mellor called the figures ``a somber
milestone in the fight against AIDS and only the first, I fear, in
what will be a series of such milestones in the future.''
   The Soviet Union, meanwhile, has recorded its second AIDS death _
a 4-month-old baby apparently infected by its mother, Tass said
Tuesday.
   The baby's 19-year-old mother had sexual contact with almost 20
partners and became pregnant after becoming infected with the AIDS
virus, the official news agency said.
   It did not give the sex of the baby or provide any more details
about it or the mother, except to say she was from the Odessa region
on the Black Sea.
   Twenty-nine people, 19 of them foreigners, are registered as
having the AIDS virus in Odessa, a major port city, Tass said.
   The first AIDS death in the Soviet Union, that of a 29-year-old
pregnant prostitute, occurred Sept. 5, Tass reported earlier this
month.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov
entered Massachusetts General Hospital this morning for tests to
determine whether he needs a pacemaker, a spokesman for the Nobel
laureate said.
   If doctors find he does need it, Sakharov will return to Boston
later this month for the operation and may extend his two-week visit
to the United States, said spokesman Matthew Bannister.Implanting
the device, which regulates the heart's rhythm, usually requires a
two-day hospital stay.
   Sakharov is believed to have suffered a minor stroke several
years ago while being force-fed by Soviet authorities during a
hunger strike. His wife, physician Yelena Bonnner, said in a letter
to her children in June 1985 that he showed ``minor Parkinsonian
symptoms,'' such as trembling hands, afterward but appeared to have
recovered otherwise.
   Sakharov, making his first visit to the West, said at a news
conference Monday that his health has been stable recently.
   Commenting on changes in his homeland, Sakharov warned that
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms face a domestic backlash,
but dismissed the personal risks of continuing his outspokenness.
   ``If perestroika does not succeed, then the question of my return
to (exile in) Gorky is totally insignificant,'' Sakharov said
through a translator. Gorbachev released Sakharov from internal
exile nearly two years ago.
   Perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economic and
political system, is ``at a very critical phase,'' the 67-year-old
Nobel Peace Prize winner told reporters during a two-hour news
conference.
   He said there are ``sharp debates in the press and at all
levels'' over political and economic issues. ``The fate is being
decided of which direction our development will go,'' said Sakharov.
   ``The West must not fear perestroika. A greater danger to the
world as a whole would be the failure of perestroika,'' he said,
warning that failure could strengthen his country's
military-industrial complex and result in an expansionist foreign
policy.
   Sakharov said arms control negotiations between the Soviet Union
and the United States are at a critical juncture, with both sides
considering 50 percent cuts in their strategic arsenals. ``It is an
extraordinary opportunity,'' he said.
   Monday was Sakharov's first full day outside the Soviet Union. He
arrived Sunday night from Moscow to begin his two-week trip to the
West by visiting relatives in the Boston area. His wife remained in
Moscow.
   On Thursday night, Sakharov flies to Washington to take part in a
board meeting of the International Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity.
   Sakharov has accepted an invitation to meet President Reagan at
the White House on Nov. 14, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters aboard Air Force One as Reagan returned to Washington
from California on Monday night.
   Sakharov's news conference was held to promote the foundation,
which was organized in January by U.S. and Soviet scientists.
   Yevgeny P. Velikhov, foundation chairman and vice president of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said the organization has begun work
on nuclear weapons verification and environmental protection and
hopes to sponsor an exchange visit of 2,000 children between the
Soviet Union and the United States next year.
   Sakharov, a physicist who helped his country develop the hydrogen
bomb in the 1950s, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his fight
for human rights. In January 1980, he was banished to Gorky, an
industrial city about 250 miles from Moscow that is closed to
foreigners, for opposing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In
December 1986, Gorbachev allowed him back to Moscow.
   Sakharov declined to comment on today's U.S. election, but said
he respects the United States for its democracy, work ethic,
dynamism, self-criticism and generosity.
   ``The phrase you often hear in the U.S. is, `Can I help you?'''
he said. ``That is something you hear mainly on the street or in
stores, but it also appears (in U.S. behavior) on the international
stage.''
   In contrast, Sakharov portrayed the political climate in his
homeland as contentious and uncertain.
   He said five ``prisoners of conscience'' who were convicted of
anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda have been released in recent
days, but he listed eight others who remain in prison camps or exile.
   He called perestroika ``a genuine, real process'' but said a
crackdown on demonstrations, including the violent breakup of a
meeting in Minsk on Oct. 30, gave him ``very great anxiety'' over
the course of the reforms.
   ``This is extremely dangerous and could destroy perestroika and
turn it around,'' he said.
   Asked to explain these seeming contradictions, Sakharov said: ``I
think it was not my words that were contradictory but the situation
itself. I have purposefully accented the positive and negative
elements so that this contradiction would be clear.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court OKs State Taxes On Oil, Gas From Outer Shelf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the
authority of the states to tax corporate income derived from sales
of oil and natural gas extracted from offshore wells under federal
jurisdiction.
   By a 9-0 vote, the court approved a tax method in Iowa that is
virtually identical to that used by most other states.
   The so-called unitary method, challenged unsuccessfully by Shell
Oil Co., allows a state to impose a tax on that portion of a
company's income calculated to come from the amount of business it
does within that state.
   Shell Oil argued that all its income from sales of Outer
Continental Shelf oil and gas should be excluded from the formula.
   But Justice Thurgood Marshall, in his opinion for the court, said
the Iowa tax does not violate a 1953 federal law authorizing
exploration and production of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas.
   ``We reject Shell's argument that Congress intended ... to
prohibit the inclusion, in a constitutionally permissible
apportionment formula, of income from Outer Continental Shelf oil
and gas,'' Marshall said.
   He said the federal law only prohibits a state adjacent to such
offshore land from taxing that land directly.
   Marshall said nothing in the law bans a state _ adjacent to the
offshore land or located inland _ from basing a tax on a company's
total income, including a portion from the sale of Outer Continental
Shelf oil and gas.
   The extent of revenue nationwide that is at stake in the case is
unclear.
   Iowa sought an additional $243,000 from Shell Oil for a six-year
period.
   The Outer Continental Shelf is underwater land more than three
miles off the shore of any state. The land is owned by the federal
government and leased to private companies.
   Tuesday's ruling upheld a 1987 decision by the Iowa Supreme Court
that was supported by the Reagan administration.
   The Justice Department said the Iowa case presented a good
opportunity for the high court to resolve the dispute over a state's
authority to tax a multistate activity.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GOES-4, a weather satellite launched eight
years ago, was sent into a high retirement orbit Tuesday, taking the
craft out of the busy space highway used by most working
communications and weather satellites.
   Lou Barbieri, chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's satellite operations center, said GOES-4 had
reached the end of its useful life and was put into a higher orbit
to get it out of the way.
   GOES-4 had spent its working life at 22,300 miles above the
Earth, the busiest altitude for satellites. At this height,
satellites take 24 hours to orbit the Earth and appear to be
stationary at one point above the globe.
   Over a three-week period, NOAA satellite controllers commanded
the GOES-4 to make six rocket firings that slowly raised the craft's
orbit by 62 miles. Barbieri said the increased altitude will add one
minute per day to the satellite's orbit period and cause it to
slowly drift westward.
   GOES-4, which cost $45 million and was expected to last only 2 to
5 years, was launched in September, 1980. It initially was stationed
over the Pacific Ocean and used infrared and visible light
instruments to capture images of weather patterns and storm
formations over the western United States. NOAA said the satellite
warned of the approach of hurricane Iwa which struck Hawaii in
November, 1982 and caused an estimated $350 million in damage.
   In 1984, GOES-4 was loaned to the European Space Agency to serve
as a weather data relay station. Barbieri said the craft was moved
to a point over the western Atlantic to help the Europeans recover
from a satellite failure.
   Barbieri said a malfunction of a primary imaging system and
depletion of on board fuel forced NOAA to retire GOES-4. He said the
agency sent two earlier satellites to even higher orbits, but GOES-4
only had enough fuel to edge up another 62 miles.
   Retirement of GOES-4 leaves NOAA with six working satellites, but
two of these, GOES-2 and GOES-3, are used only as communication
relays, Barbieri said.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis joined millions of other
Americans at the polls today at the end of their long presidential
campaign. Bush said, ``I feel nervous,'' though pre-election surveys
showed him leading. Dukakis predicted a surprise victory.
   Republican Bush and his wife, Barbara, voted in Houston shortly
after sunup.
   ``Every time I vote here I feel nervous,'' he told reporters.
   ``No predictions,'' he replied when asked about the outcome.
   After two days of non-stop campaigning, including pre-dawn stops
today in Iowa and Michigan, Democrat Dukakis returned to Boston.
   ``I think tonight we're not only going to surprise a few people,
but we're going to be doing the celebrating,'' he told supporters
who welcomed him at the airport.
   ``I voted for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen and I'm proud of
it,'' he said after casting his ballot later, along with wife Kitty,
daughters Andrea and Kara and son John.
   ``I come away from all of this even more optimistic about the
future of this great country of ours than when I started,'' a
sleepless Dukakis had told 3,000 supporters who turned out for a 3
a.m. rally in sub-freezing weather in Des Moines, Iowa.
   ``Our spirits are bright, the future looks good. We're grateful
to all of you,'' he told several hundred people who stood in the
rain in Detroit.
   Initial reports from around the country were of a heavy early
turnout of voters. In Georgia, North Carolina, Rhode Island and
Tennessee, elections officials said early turnout was heavier than
normal.
   Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle, made no secret of his choice
after voting in his hometown of Huntington, Ind.
   ``Well, we got one sure vote,'' Quayle said. ``Two,'' chimed in
his wife Marilyn who accompanied him.
   Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, was in his
home state of Texas although he had used an absentee ballot to cast
his vote early.
   Following long-standing tradition, the 38 voters of Dixville
Notch, N.H., cast their ballots at midnight.
   Their votes, the first counted, were 34 for Bush, three for
Dukakis and one write-in ballot for former Republican candidate Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York.
   In Rhode Island, Tom DiPrete was arrested after he tore down
campaign posters of Democrat Bruce Sundlun who is running against
DiPrete's father, Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete.
   On his father's orders, the younger DiPrete went to the Sundlun
campaign headquarters and apologized. Police released him without
filing charges.
   One of the nation's most unusual contests was in Union Point,
Ga., where Mayor Ben Stewart was being challenged by his younger
brother, Bob.
   ``The only comment I would want to make,'' the mayor said, ``is
that it's a very sad, regrettable, unfortunate situation.''
   With pollsters still finding millions of voters claiming they
hadn't made up their minds, Bush and Dukakis made final-hour appeals
for support on television Monday night.
   ``I cannot predict all of the challenges America will face in the
years ahead,'' Bush said at the conclusion of a 30-minute television
commercial broadcast on the three major networks. ``I can tell you
what principles will guide me, what values I hold dear and I can say
that I believe I have the experience to be a steady hand guiding our
country.''
   He described Dukakis as someone with ``no experience in national
security affairs.''
   The Democratic nominee's 30-minute appeal was on the networks
immediately preceding the Bush broadcast.
   In his broadcast, Dukakis spoke of family, jobs, senior citizens,
hunger and farmers and answered questions on issues that have dogged
him, including his record on crime, his military policy and his
reluctance to respond to the negative attacks.
   Dukakis also charged anew that the Republicans would try to
balance the budget by cutting Social Security, and he called Bush's
proposal to reduce capital gains taxes ``a new $40 billion,
five-year capital gains tax giveaway for the very rich.''
   ``Now who is going to pay for that tax break?'' Dukakis asked.
``Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask
yourself, is George Bush on your side?''
   The campaigns paid about $1 million each for the time for their
back-to-back appeals.
   ``We are running an unprecedented level of activity to turn out
our voters,'' said Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager. ``By
our calculation there's a half a dozen to 10 states that are within
a couple of points where being able to turn out our vote can make
the difference.''
   ``The question is not whether turnout will go down but rather how
far,'' said Curtis B. Gans, director of the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate.
   While predicting that up to 95 million Americans would vote, Gans
said the percentage of eligible voters casting ballots could be the
lowest since 1948 when it was 51.1 percent.
   Americans who do vote will elect 33 senators and the entire
House, as well as 12 governors and thousands of other state and
locals officials.
   Of the Senate seats being filled, 18 currently are held by
Democrats and 15 by Republicans. By most estimates the Democrats,
now holding a 54-46 majority, should keep control.
   Among the closest Senate races were contests for open seats in
Florida, Washington, Wisconsin and Mississippi. Threatened
incumbents included Chic Hecht, R-Nev., Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., and
John Melcher, D-Mont.
   Democrats control the House by a 255-177 margin and not even the
most partisan Republicans expect that to change very much.
   Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House Banking
Committee, had his re-election prospects jolted two weeks ago when a
federal judge made public a Justice Department report referring to
``substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct'' by the
lawmaker.
   The race between St Germain and Republican Ronald K. Machtley was
rated a tossup.
   Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., was under indictment for perjury and
was trailing Democratic challenger Ben Jones in recent polls.
   Among the nation's governors, three Republicans _ Arch Moore of
West Virginia, Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island and Norman Bangerter
of Utah _ were rated the most threatened. In addition, Democrat Evan
Bayh was favored to defeat Republican John Mutz in the race to
succeed GOP Indiana Gov. Robert D. Orr.
   In the presidential race, the polls offered encouraging news to
Bush, with all indicating his lead had stabilized after narrowing
somewhat over the weekend.
   A CBS News poll said Bush's lead had increased to nine points
after narrowing to six during the weekend. A Harris poll that said
Dukakis had closed the gap to four points said that movement halted
Monday.
   A new Gallup poll said Bush had an 11-point lead that was holding
steady. The poll, which had reported 20 percent undecided, said that
figure had dropped to 5 percent.

   At least 6,700 Ugandan refugees have
returned home from the southern Sudanese town of Yei in a convoy of
93 trucks, state radio reported Tuesday.
   The refugees, many of whom fled during the rule of dictator Idi
Amin in the 1970s, arrived Sunday in the town of Arua, about 220
miles northwest of Kampala, an official representing the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees told Radio Uganda.
   The refugees were escorted to the Ugandan border by Sudanese
troops to protect them from attacks by Christian and animist rebels
who are fighting for autonomy in southern Sudan.
   Amin had about 100,000 opponents killed before he was ousted in
1979 and replaced by President Milton Obote. Ugandans continued to
flee their country in the 1980s because of fighting between
government troops and guerillas led by Yoweri Museveni.
   The refugees began returning after Museveni seized power in
February 1986.

   Experts estimated that nearly 129.5 million Americans were
registered to vote, or slightly less than 71 percent of the eligible
population, a decline from four years ago. On that basis, the
non-partisan Committee for the Study of the American Electorate
predicted turnout would fall to its lowest level in 40 years, or
slightly over 50 percent.
   That didn't deter the candidates who toed the starting line for
the 1988 presidential race in the days following Reagan's 1984
re-election landslide. The marathon eventually consumed hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   After the tumult of the primary campaigns _ Bush and Dukakis both
took early lumps before triumphing _ the presidential race came down
to a bare-knuckled battle between the 64-year-old vice president and
the 55-year-old Massachusetts governor.
   Not to mention their running mates _ the 41-year-old Quayle and
the 67-year-old Bentsen for the Democrats.
   It fell to them to produce the most riveting moment of the
campaign, doubtless to Quayle's undying regret. The Indiana senator
had just finished comparing himself favorably to John F. Kennedy
when Bentsen turned to him in campaign debate and said, ``Senator,
you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   Bush campaigned as the loyal, logical heir to Reagan and his
two-term conservative revolution. He promised to extend the peace
and prosperity the president claimed as their legacy, but with an
emphasis on education, child care and other issues that would make
America a ``kinder, gentler nation.''
   But he also turned on his rival with commercials of unsurpassed
toughness and employed tough-guy rhetoric in made-for-television
campaign appearances. He said his reply to the Democrats in Congress
would be, ``Read my lips, no new taxes.''
   He trashed Dukakis freely, evoking images of Jimmy Carter when he
said, ``Let's not gamble on another liberal governor coming out of
nowhere who will take us back to the bad old days.''
   Behind in the polls as the summer conventions were ending, he
flicked on the attack ads. Soft on crime, soft on defense, soft on
the Pledge of Allegiance and soft on the environment _ the Bush ads
depicted Dukakis as a quintessential Massachusetts liberal, a man
``outside of the mainstream.''
   Bush made Massachusetts furlough escapee Willie Horton a
household name, and one memorable advertisement depicted the state's
prison system as a revolving door.
   Dukakis had won the Democratic nomination as the architect of the
``Massachusetts Miracle`` and touted his accomplishments in housing,
welfare reform, mandatory health insurance and other concerns. And
he set out to win the fall campaign the same way.
   He absorbed Bush's punishing blows for weeks before heeding the
pleas of Bentsen and other prominent Democrats to fight back. By the
time he did he was far behind in the polls and in need of another
miracle.
   After a lackluster performance in the second and final
presidential debate, he charted a new, populist course and began
waving Republican brochures in the air to dramatize his complaints
that Bush was resorting to ``garbage'' to defeat him.
   ``I'm on your side,'' he said over and over to the average man
and woman. Bush ``wants to help the people who have it made, I want
to help every American family make it,'' he added.
   He attacked Quayle as a risky man to have so close to the Oval
Office, and made the unprecedented move of placing his own running
mate on network television for a five-minute commercial. Dukakis
criticized Bush and Quayle in new, tougher ads.
   All this was a far cry from the man who stood before the
Democratic National Convention and said the election ``isn't about
ideology. It's about competence.'' Bush swiftly rebutted that at his
own political coronation, saying the race was about ``the values we
honor.''
   Bush had a campaign machine that hummed _ even while spitting
political nails at Dukakis.
   The Dukakis machine was a clunker in the judgment of many
Democrats around the country who faulted its advertising, speeches
and scheduling, and finally its candidate.
   By the end, the polls agreed the election was turning voters off.
   Still, neither Bush nor Dukakis hit the level of Senate
Republican candidate Jay Wolfe in West Virginia. He aired a
commercial juxtaposing Byrd and a bloody fetus, and the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee ordered him to stop airing it.
   Bush hoped for a ``mainstream mandate,'' but if there was a
national trend in was difficult to discern in advance.
   Some Democrats in Senate races in Florida and elsewhere distanced
themselves from Dukakis, fearing they would be swept away if they
did not. But in Ohio and Washington, Democrats ran as liberal and
proud.
   Some of the most powerful and best known members of Congress were
retiring voluntarily.
   The list ran to Democrat John Stennis in Mississippi; William
Proxmire in Wisconsin and Lawton Chiles in Florida _ committee
chairmen all. The roster also included Republican Rep. Jack Kemp,
who made a career of espousing conservative causes and harbors
presidential hopes of his own, as well as Democratic Rep. Peter
Rodino. He led the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings
against President Richard Nixon in 1974.
   The prediction was that whoever the new president was, the
Congress that greeted him would be Democratic.
   Eighty-one incumbents faced either no major part opposition or
only third-party rivals. That included 61 Democrats and 20
Republicans.
   Republicans said they hoped to eat into the Democrats' Senate
majority, but had scarcely the faintest hopes of re-creating the
Reagan landslide in 1980 that swept a dozen Democrats out of office.
   Reagan turned the White House into an arm of the Bush campaign.
   He appointed Cabinet officers that would be attractive in an
election year and swallowed his objections to Democratic-inspired
plant closing legislation that Bush didn't want vetoed for fear of
the damage to his campaign.
   With a final campaign stop in California the day before the
election, the president racked up 25,000 miles for Republican
candidates.
   ``We need you to ride with us,'' he told a crowd at a rodeo
center in Texas. ``And if you would, I hope you'll help win just one
more for the Gipper.''
   Some sounded like they couldn't wait to saddle up for another
ride.
   Jesse Jackson spoke for ambitious Democrats everywhere when he
said a few days before the election that if Dukakis lost on Tuesday,
``the next political season will begin on Wednesday.''

<HEAD>Oyster Industry Switching Fish To Survive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SHELLPILE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The air is pungent with the smell of the
sea and seagulls busily pick through piles of crushed oyster and
clam shells, but the pervading mood is mournful because the oysters
are dying out.
   Since the late 1950s, oysters in the Delaware and Chesapeake bays
have been plagued by a parasite known as MSX _ ``multinucleated
sphere, unknown.''
   Off southern New Jersey, the problem has become so bad that
oyster fishing has been almost entirely eliminated for the past two
years. People who make their living from the shellfish are hoping
that a parasite-resistant strain of oysters can be introduced, but
meanwhile, packing houses have had to modify their operations to
survive.
   At Robbins Bros. Oysters, for instance, newly painted signs
announce that ``fresh seafood'' is now the main business.
   ``We have 25 people working here now, but at one time we had
about 100,'' said co-owner George McConnell, who fished for oysters
for 20 years. ``Many have gone to work for the sand plant down the
road, some local factories or gone to Atlantic City to work in the
casinos.''
   Down the road in Port Norris, the Peterson Packing Co. now shucks
and processes oysters trucked in from Connecticut, where the disease
has not had an effect.
   ``It's a harsh reality _ there has been no oyster harvest last
year or this year,'' said manager Harold Bickings, a former
oysterman. ``The last time we went to check on seed oysters in
Delaware Bay, they virtually had all died.
   ``There aren't any New Jersey oysters around here. They can't be
called a thing of the past, but they are definitely not a thing of
the present.''
   Oystermen in these small bay towns are holding out hope that
Rutgers University researchers, stationed in nearby Bivalve, will
find a solution.
   ``We have a great amount of expectations that they can produce
immune oysters,'' Bickings said.
   John Kraeuter, associate director of the Rutgers Shellfish
Research Laboratory, said, ``We're making pretty good headway on
such an oyster, but it's not going to revive the industry within the
year.''
   When researchers found a way to breed a resistant strain of
oyster, local oystermen banded together to form a non-profit
corporation that put samples of the strain in an oyster bed to
continue the research.
   ``Rutgers has the technology, but they needed the physical work
to continue this,'' said Robert Morgan Sr., 61, a former oysterman
who now manages the Port Norris Oyster Co., a packing house that
survived by switching to clams.
   Kraeuter said the test oysters ``are showing pretty good
resistance once they are `planted' in the (Delaware) bay, but we've
only got one batch so far. We have a bunch more sitting on racks
still to be planted.''
   In the meantime, some loyal oystermen like 75-year-old Fenton
Anderson of Port Norris have been ``just relaxing'' during the MSX
crisis.
   ``A lot of the younger people have gone crabbing and some have
left the area and found other jobs but, of course, some people like
me are too old to do anything else,'' he said.
   ``But there's always hope in the midst of despair,'' Anderson
said. ``I think they might be on to something now down at the
Rutgers lab. In the meantime, I'm not moldering. I've still got my
boat and I still lease my oyster beds from the state, because you
never know.''
   Morgan added: ``Nobody's really happy about what's happened here,
but nobody's shedding tears, either. We all shifted to something
else _ seafood, clams, crabs.
   ``Nobody's sitting around waiting for something to happen.''

   The national soccer team should
accept an invitation to play in Britain, even though hard feelings
still exist with the country because of the 1982 Falklands War, the
foreign minister.
   ``It seems to me that we should get closer in sports activities
while looking for a (political) dialogue, keeping in mind that
that's not going to produce magic solutions,'' Foreign Minister
Dante Caputo said Monday evening in a radio interview.
   The Argentine Soccer Association was invited last month to
participate in the 1989 Sir Stanley Rous Cup.
   No Argentine soccer team has played in Britain since the war,
although players from both countries have competed against each
other in soccer, tennis, boxing and golf.
   In the 1986 World Cup quarterfinals in Mexico City, Argentina
defeated Britain 2-1, en route to victory over West Germany, 3-2, in
the finals.
   The 1982 war was fought over the Falkland Islands that Britain
has ruled since 1833. Argentina claims it inherited the archipelago
it calls the Malvinas, located off its south Atlantic coast, upon
asserting independence from Spain in 1810.
   Argentina invaded the islands in April. Britain recovered them 74
days later. About 1,000 soldiers from both sides lost their lives in
the fighting.
   Argentina has refused to end hostilities with Britain, which has
substantially fortified its military positions on the islands.
Diplomatic relations broken in 1982 have not been resumed.

   Scores of novice anglers are attracted to a
course at Valdosta State College that allows students to earn
college credits while fishing.
   Titled Freshwater Fishing 315, the course is filled to capacity
each quarter with students who want to bait hooks and reel in
catfish, bluegill, perch and bass.
   ``It's a fun course,'' said instructor Lindy Evans, 45. ``The
homework is excellent _ meaning go fishing.''
   Evans covers all the basics of the sport, from matching rods with
reels to selecting appropriate fishing lines, lures, hooks and bait.
His classes also focus on techniques for catching fish.
   Before graduating from the course, students make one or two
visits to fishponds in the area to test their skills.
   Evans' two-credit-hour course is sponsored by the college's
Physical Education Department as a leisure activity, a category that
also includes such things as golf and tennis.

   Want a take-out supper? Maybe the hospital
could suit your palate.
   Hospital food may not have the world's greatest reputation, but
Lawrence Memorial Hospital, for one, is promoting a new frozen
dinner that it says offers healthy, tasty and quick eating.
   On Monday, the hospital began selling ``Light and Right''
dinners, created especially for sale through hospitals by Baxter
Health Care of Chicago.
   The meals, similar to those sold in grocery stores, are low in
calories, sodium, fat and cholesterol, said Nancy Donahey, dietitian
at the hospital.
   She said the meals are largely for the convenience of people
going home from the hospital on special diets.
   ``It may be the answer for their recuperation period when they
are not able to get up and prepare meals,'' she said.
   However, the dietary office at the hospital will sell the meals
to the public as well. Hospital employees were recently treated to a
sampling, and Judith Hefley, director of community relations, said,
``I liked them, actually.''

   Hohendorf, 33, is vice president of Roostertail catering in

   ``We had to hire an extra secretary just to staple fax papers

<HEAD>Drought Persists as Midwest Dry Season Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rainy autumn helped ease the dryness in the
East and some Central states, but large areas of the Upper Midwest
are facing winter still in the grip of long-term drought.
   ``Subsurface soil moisture is still very low in a lot of
states,'' Douglas LeComte, a meteorologist with the Department of
Agriculture, said Tuesday. ``That could come back to haunt us next
spring.''
   ``We still have lingering effects from the drought so we will
definitely have to watch the winter rainfall, to see if the soil
moisture gets replenished,'' he said.
   Fall rainfall eased the problem in the Southeast _ especially
rains from tropical storms, LeComte said. And moisture has improved
in the Ohio, middle Missouri and lower Mississippi valleys.
   But the federal Climate Analysis Center lists conditions of
extreme long-term drought as continuing in North Dakota, Idaho,
Wyoming, most of Montana and portions of South Dakota, Minnesota,
Iowa, Oregon and California.
   Much of that region received less than half of normal
precipitation during the year that ended Aug. 31, and an even larger
region received 75 percent or less during that 12-month period.
   Severe drought also extends to surrounding areas, as well as
parts of North Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
Virginia.
   The assessments are based on the Palmer Drought Index, a complex
long-term measurement that considers rainfall, evaporation, soil
moisture and other factors.
   Planting of the winter wheat crop _ which is done in the fall _
is about complete, LeComte says, but problems may be lurking.
   In Kansas, for example, he explained that seeding is near
completion, crop emergence is good, but lack of soil moisture may be
limiting root development.
   The West Coast, meanwhile, should be starting its normally wet
season as storms come ashore from the Pacific Ocean.
   ``The West Coast has had two dry winters in a row and this winter
is getting off to a slow start,'' LeComte added, noting that the
region depends on the winter snow pack to get through summer.
   Reservoir carryover in much of the West is poor, due to heavy use
for irrigation this summer, according to the fall western water
supply summary issued by the Soil Conservation Service and National
Weather Service.
   ``In most regions of the West, the 1989 water year begins with
low soil moisture reserves, low reservoir carryover and deficit
seasonal precipitation,'' the report states. The water year is
measured from autumn to autumn.
   The nation's overall shortage of moisture is no longer getting
the attention it did a few weeks ago, thanks largely to three
factors: the end of the major farm growing season; a rise in river
levels that improved barge traffic; and rains that eased the dryness
in eastern areas.
   But in the still affected areas, the outlook may be bleak.
   ``With the start of the normally dry fall and winter months in
the northern Great Plains, prospects for significant precipitation
to eliminate long-term dryness in the area appear unfavorable,'' the
Climate Analysis Center said.
   The Climate Analysis Center is no longer listing the drought in
the North Central states among major climate ``anomalies'' _ the
unusual weather or climate events it studies. But that's only
because dryness is normal at this time of year.
   In question is whether winter will bring sufficient snowfall, or
next spring will provide the rains needed to restore the soil
moisture to normal.
   Weather watchers are not making forecasts yet for spring, but the
National Weather Service's 90-day outlook through the end of January
calls for lighter than normal snowfall over much of the Upper
Midwest, particularly in the Great Lakes region, Idaho, Montana and
Wyoming.

   Army rescuers and medical teams finally reached
stricken villages Tuesday in a remote area near Burma where China's
worst earthquake in more than a decade killed at least 930 people
last weekend.
   Official Beijing radio said more than 100 people had been rescued
from the rubble of collapsed buildings and many more were believed
to be trapped.
   It said 1,000 soldiers were involved in the rescue operation and
the central government had allocated $53.6 million.
   Sunday night's temblor registered 7.6 on the Richter scale,
indicating a quake of tremendous destructive force. It was centered
in Lancang and Menglian counties of Yunnan province, about 240 miles
southwest of Kunming, the provincial capital.
   More than 170 aftershocks had been felt by Tuesday afternoon but
their strength was declining, said Li Xianhu of the State Seismology
Bureau in Beijing.
   About 14 counties were affected, covering 16,000 square miles in
a long corridor near Yunnan's southwestern frontier with Burma.
Officials said they did not know the population of the mountainous,
jungle-covered region, most of whose residents are farmers of the
Lahu, Va and Dai minorities.
   Lancang county alone has 400,000 people, the Civil Affairs
Ministry said.
   Information on casualties and rescue work was sparse and most
government offices refused to answer reporters' questions, but the
Civil Affairs Ministry told the U.N. Development Program and World
Food Program offices in Beijing more than 930 people were killed.
The two agencies said the ministry did not request assistance.
   Ministry officials initially gave the same figure to some foreign
reporters, but later denied issuing it, apparently because it had
been released without permission.
   Sun Shaocheng of the ministry's emergency rescue office said,
``The number is climbing.''
   Official media reported lower figures.
   A Beijing radio report late Tuesday said 796 people were dead and
840 injured. Xinhua, the official news agency, said 689 bodies had
been recovered by Tuesday evening and about 600 people were injured.
   Xinhua said the quake destroyed half the houses in the Lancang
county seat and nearby towns, and 90 percent of those in the small
towns of Fubang, Zhutang and Shangyong. It did not give the
populations of the towns.
   It was China's worst earthquake since one of 7.8 on the Richter
scale that leveled the northeastern city of Tangshan on July 28,
1976. It killed 242,000 people by official count.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A temblor
measuring 7 is capable of causing widespread, heavy damage in
populated areas. Each number on the scale means a tenfold increase
of intensity.
   Early Tuesday, rescue teams reached the village of Zhanmapo,
which virtually was destroyed by the quake, the radio reported.
   Xie Chao, an employee of the station, said he did not know the
population of Zhanmapo. On Monday, the station identified the
village as Shanmato.
   Xinhua's bureau in Kunming said the quake area had ample supplies
of food and water but its main road link to the outside remained
cut. Medical teams were flown in by helicopter, but the television
news showed soldiers driving in trucks through one heavily damaged
area.
   The news agency said medical teams were working to prevent an
outbreak of disease due to the large number of dead and poor
hygiene, but gave no details. The brief TV news report showed an
aerial view of a heavily damaged town, with victims being pulled
from the rubble, but the town was not named.
   It is an area of heavy rains, and most residents have wooden
homes on stilts in valleys between the Wuliang, Nu and other
mountain ranges.
   The Lahu, who live in Lancang, are Buddhists, related to Tibetans
and Burmans. The Va, also Buddhist, speak a language of the
Mon-Khmer family.

   Michael Dukakis, home for the final count after an
exhausting marathon run for the presidency, looked to Massachusetts
Tuesday for a safe 13 electoral votes in his Democratic column.
   Massachusetts voters also were deciding whether to ban nuclear
power in the state, mandate ``humane treatment'' of farm animals,
repeal a legislative pay raise and repeal a state law requiring
union wages on public construction projects.
   Dukakis, governor here for 10 of the past 14 years, led a
traditionally strong Democratic ticket in Massachusetts, where
voters were expected to re-elect Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to a sixth
term over Republican challenger Joseph D. Malone, along with all
incumbents in the state's liberal House delegation. Those
congressmen included Kennedy's nephew, Joseph P. Kennedy II, who was
seeking a second term.
   Dukakis was favored in the last Massachusetts opinion polls by a
double-digit margin over Republican George Bush, who was also born
in Massachusetts but turned the state's liberal reputation against
Dukakis in the general election.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   With a home-state candidate, Massachusetts politics was dominated
by the presidential contest, even though Dukakis rarely visited his
home state after Labor Day.
   Republicans, seeking to cast doubt on Dukakis' effectiveness,
pointed to problems his administration was encountering in balancing
the state budget. Bush fueled that campaign by venturing into Boston
twice in the campaign, to highlight the pollution of Boston Harbor
and to claim the Boston police union's endorsement.
   By late August, Dukakis saw his lead in Massachusetts polls
evaporate. But with a late counter-offensive of radio advertising,
field organizing and appeals to home-state pride, Dukakis regained
the edge by mid-October and widened it in the closing days.

   Michigan voters cast ballots Tuesday in two hotly
contested races, a neck-and-neck Bush-Dukakis showdown for the
state's 20 electoral votes and a yes-or-no decision on banning
state-funded abortions.
   Late polls showed Republican nominee George Bush with only a
slight edge over his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, in the
presidential race in Michigan, an industrial state targeted by both
campaigns for personal appearances by the candidates in the final
days.
   Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle was favored as he sought a third
term against former Republican Rep. James W. Dunn Jr.
   In the U.S. House races, all incumbents _ 11 Democrats and seven
Republicans _ sought re-election.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Both presidential nominees visited Michigan in the campaign's
closing days. Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis made 11 trips here between
his nomination and Election Day, including a rally at dawn in
Detroit Tuesday before he flew home to Boston. Vice President Bush
made eight trips to Michigan.
   The outcome of Proposal A, the abortion proposition, was closely
watched by pro-choice and anti-abortion forces in other states as a
gauge of sentiment for their causes.
   At issue was about $6 million spent annually by the state for
about 18,600 abortions for poor women.
   Supporters of the ban argued state funding made Michigan an
advocate of abortion. Opponents said a ban would discriminate
against poor women.
   Riegle raised $4 million for his campaign, while Dunn was forced
to spend about $260,000 from his own pocket.
   Riegle's campaign stressed experience. Dunn accused the senator
of working in Washington for his own wealth and power at the expense
of Michigan interests.

   President Reagan announced Tuesday that he is
giving Joseph Wright Jr. a recess appointment to succeed James C.
Miller III as director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   Wright has been acting director since Miller's resignation on
Oct. 15. Miller is now affiliated with Citizens for a Sound Economy,
a Washington-based research organization.
   Before becoming acting director of OMB, Wright was deputy
director. Before that he was deputy secretary of commerce.
   The recess appointment gives him the position of director without
the need of his being confirmed by the Senate. Congress has
adjourned until January, when Reagan's term will end.
   Reagan will submit the fiscal 1990 budget to Congress before he
leaves office.

<HEAD>Man Who Accepted Dare Pleads Guilty To Bus Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bus passenger who took the wheel after
the driver pulled over in a fit of anger, challenged him to take
over and stormed off the bus was fined $1,151 when he pleaded guilty
to a misdemeanor theft charge.
   James Biddle drove the bus, loaded with 31 passengers, for about
a mile and a half Oct. 19, making all the proper stops and
collecting all the proper fares, but a city attorney said it was
still wrong because the passengers could have been hurt.
   Biddle, 52, entered his plea to the misdemeanor charge Monday in
North Orange County Municipal Court. In addition to the fine, Judge
Robert Hutson placed Biddle on three years of informal probation.
   Biddle, a Hughes Aircraft engineer, took over the bus after an
argument with driver Kim Dale Miller, 36, who was later fired.
   Several passengers offered this account of what happened: Miller
was yelling at a passenger for his failure to board with the right
fare. When Biddle urged Miller to make smoother stops, Miller became
even more incensed, pulled the bus over to the curb, challenged
Biddle to drive and stormed off the bus.
   After driving for a while, Biddle flagged down a police officer
and told him what happened.
   ``Even though I pleaded guilty, it does not mean that I feel
guilty in my own eyes,'' Biddle said Monday.
   ``I had to relieve the other passengers of the jeopardy that the
driver was putting them in. I only wanted to get out of the area as
quickly and as far as possible,'' he said.
   Anaheim Deputy City Attorney Terese Scanlon disagreed. ``He
endangered the lives of all the other people,'' she said. ``I have
empathy with his frustration, but I can't condone his conduct. Two
wrongs don't make a right.''
   She agreed to dismiss a misdemeanor count of driving a bus
without a proper license in exchange for his guilty plea to the
charge of unlawfully taking a vehicle.
   Biddle said he chose to plea bargain after he talked to an
attorney who told him it would cost $1,500 in attorney's fees and he
might be fined up to $2,000 and sentenced to two years in jail if
convicted.

   An Indian MiG-21 fighter jet crashed into
a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital on
Tuesday, killing a 3-year-old girl, a news agency reported.
   At least eight other people on the ground were injured, six of
them seriously, as the plane hit three houses, United News of India
said.
   The pilot of the single-seat plane, Squadron Leader R. Malhotra,
bailed out safely before it crashed and burned in a cluster of
houses near a state-run health center in Najafgarh, about 15 miles
west of central New Delhi, said Defense Ministry spokesman T.G.
Nallumuthu.
   The girl, identified as Sunita Singh, died of burns, UNI said.
   Press Trust of India, another news agency, said eight other
people remained hospitalized, six of them in serious condition.
   The plane was one of 24 scheduled to participate in a fly-by
salute as President Ramaswamy Venkataraman presented colors to an
air force squadron at New Delhi's Palam air force base. The fly-by
was canceled after the crash, an air force spokesman said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The cause of the crash was not known, but UNI said the plane was
hit by a bird. High-flying vultures and other birds of prey pose
hazards to aircraft in the New Delhi area.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The condition of Emperor Hirohito deteriorated
Tuesday when his blood pressure plummeted, but it later improved
slightly, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old emperor discharged a small amount of blood early
in the afternoon and his blood pressure fell, as it has several
times before. But this time it did not recover despite an emergency
blood transfusion, palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
   Later in the afternoon, Hirohito's blood pressure still was only
68 over 30, a level that can cause brain damage if not raised.
   ``This is not an unexpected development, but I'm concerned about
how it will turn out,'' Maeda quoted the emperor's chief physician,
Akira Takagi, as saying.
   Vice Grand Steward Iwao Miyao said the emperor's vital signs were
improving in the evening, and his upper blood pressure reading had
risen to about 90. A normal blood pressure reading is about 120 over
80.
   Maeda said the emperor remained conscious during and after the
blood discharge, which occurred while he was watching his regular
daily 15-minute television drama.
   His temperature, normally 95.9 degrees, soared to 102.2 degrees
this afternoon but dropped to 99.1 degrees by evening, palace
sources said.
   ``His condition has slightly improved since 5:30 p.m., but we are
still concerned about his condition and we will continue to monitor
it carefully and give necessary treatment,'' Maeda said.
   The 1.26-pint transfusion Tuesday brought the total amount of
blood Hirohito has received to more than 41 pints since he first
began suffering from internal bleeding Sept. 19.
   Palace sources say it will be difficult to continue giving him
blood because doctors are having difficulty finding suitable veins
to administer the transfusions.
   Also Tuesday, Prince Aya, the emperor's 22-year-old grandson,
visited Hirohito with his family. Aya has been studying at Britain's
Oxford Univerity and returned to Japan on Monday.
   Aya's return ``was rather hastily decided because of the
emperor's worsening condition,'' Maeda said.

<HEAD>Newspaper's Drug, Alcohol Testing Policy Ruled Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The implementation of drug and alcohol testing
policies by the Star Tribune without bargaining with the local guild
has been ruled an unfair labor practice, in a case that could become
a national precedent.
   The company's refusal to provide information about the policy's
enforcement at the union's request also is an unfair labor practice,
Administrative Law Judge Wallace Nations ruled last week in
Washington.
   He said such testing meets legal definitions of issues that must
be negotiated between employers and unions.
   The case has the potential to be precedent-setting nationwide
because the National Labor Relations Board has not yet ruled on any
appeals involving the issue, said Diane Williams, assistant director
of the NLRB's information division.
   If the company does not appeal Nations' ruling by Dec. 1, the
NLRB will adopt it routinely, probably in early December, and
Nations' recommendations will take effect, said Joe Moore, the
board's deputy executive secretary.
   If the company does appeal, a panel or the full board will
consider it, he said.
   John Dennison, vice president of labor relations for the
newspaper, said Monday that the company was disappointed by the
ruling but had not decided whether to appeal.
   The judge recommended that the company be ordered to revoke its
drug and alcohol testing policies covering applicants and employees
in jobs covered by its contract with Local 2 of the News Guild of
the Twin Cities and to negotiate future policies with the guild. The
local represents about 350 newsroom and circulation employees of the
Star Tribune.
   Nations also recommended that the newspaper be required to offer
a job to any applicant rejected under the policy since it was
imposed on Jan. 1, 1987, and pay the applicant for related losses.
He also recommended that the company rescind any punishment that
might have been imposed on employees under the policy and compensate
them for their losses.
   The Star Tribune's policy requires a medical exam, including drug
and alcohol screening, for applicants to whom the company offers a
job. If applicants test positive, the company will withdraw the job
offer.
   The policy also provides that current employees may be asked to
undergo screening when management believes that job performance or
conduct is impaired by alcohol or drug abuse.
   Dennison said no employee has been tested under the policy since
it took effect and that he knew of only one job applicant who had
withdrawn after learning about the policy.
   Under Nations' recommendations, the newspaper would be required
to give the union the names and addresses of people who have applied
for guild-covered jobs at the paper since the policy took effect and
identify those who refused to take the tests.

<TEXT>
   The parents of Mohammed Hamadi
testified at his trial Tuesday, with his father saying the confessed
hijacker was under 21 at the time of the incident and his mother
saying he was innocent.
   The defendant burst into tears when his mother entered the
courtroom.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut. U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem, 23, was killed and 39 Americans were held
hostage for 17 days.
   Stethem's parents also attended the trial Tuesday. His father,
Richard, took notes and his mother, Patricia, watched the
proceedings with little show of emotion.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger told Hamadi's mother, Fatima,
that relatives can refuse to testify ``because it's easy to give
false statements out of love.''
   She replied: ``I know that my son is innocent. I know that he's
very young and that we live under terrible conditions'' in Beirut.
   Of the case itself, she said: ``I don't know anything about this.
I can't read or write.''
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied
killing Stethem.
   Fatima Hamadi and her 59-year-old husband, Ali Hassan, traveled
to Frankfurt from Beirut last week to testify. When she walked into
the courtroom Tuesday, in a black dress with a white shawl covering
her head, Mohammed Hamadi stood up until she was seated in the
witness stand.
   He held his hand to his heart and bowed as she began replying to
Mueckenberger's questions in a soft, shaky voice, then suddenly he
burst into tears and dried his eyes with handkerchief.
   Those accused of terrorism in the Middle East seldom face trial
and it is even rarer for parents of a defendant to appear in court.
   Ali Hassan Hamadi testified his son fought with the Shiite
militia Amal in Beirut ``because war had begun and everyone fought.''
   ``Mohammed was injured in the fighting,'' said the father. ``He
was hit in the head and we all thought we had lost him.''
   Asked by Mueckenberger if he thought the young man had recovered
fully from the head injuries, he replied: ``I don't know exactly if
he's right in his head.'' His son and others in the court laughed at
the response.
   Both parents testified in Arabic, which was translated into
German by a court interpreter.
   The judge asked Ali Hassan Hamadi about the work of Mohammed's
older brother, Abdul Hadi Hamadi, Beirut security chief for the
Shiite group Hezbollah, which is allied with Iran and is believed to
be an umbrella group for those holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I know about Amal and I know about Hezbollah, but I don't know
who works for them and I'm not interested,'' the father said.
   He said he lives in Bourj el-Barajneh. The south Beirut district
is a Hezbollah stronghold.
   Court records show Mohammed Hamadi was born June 13, 1964. The
father, when asked the birthdate, said:
   ``He was born on Lebanon's Independence Day, Nov. 22, in 1964. I
can remember because it's a holiday and I did not have to work that
day.''
   His age at the time of the hijacking _ whether he was an adult _
is important in determining the length of the prison sentence if
Mohammed Hamadi is convicted.
   If it is determined that he was 21 at the time of the hijacking,
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison; if it is found that
he was younger at the time of the crime, the maximum sentence is 15
years in prison.
   The defendant's Lebanese wife, Najad, said in the spectator
section, which is separated from the main courtroom by bulletproof
glass, wearing a black chador that covered her hair but not her
face. They were married in late 1986.
   His oldest brother, Adnan, also was present. The father said
Adnan was born ``sometime in 1951'' and all the family's 11 children
were delivered at home by midwife.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at the Frankfurt airport Jan. 13,
1987, after customs agents found liquid explosives in his luggage.
The United States requested extradition but West Germany refused,
fearing for the lives of two West German hostages held in Beirut at
the time.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was convicted by a Duesseldorf court in April
of planning the kidnappings to gain Mohammed's freedom and was
sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   He also was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987, two
weeks after his brother. Both West German hostages have been
released.

<HEAD>Chun Ready to Surrender Assets, Party Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan is ready
to surrender his wealth to stop escalating demonstrations demanding
his punishment, ruling party sources said Tuesday.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Chun
would surrender most of his assests if President Roh Tae-woo ensures
the former president's safety.
   ``Mr. Chun still thinks he has no ill-gotten wealth, but he is
willing to donate most of his assents if he is assured that it would
quiet down the raging public protests,'' the ruling party sources
said.
   Chun has about $5.7 million in personal assets, including a $1.4
million residence in Seoul, the sources said.
   Chun and his family have been embattled by allegations of
corruption and human rights abuses under his government. The
National Assembly is conducting an unprecedented investigation into
the allegations.
   Chun, a former general who took power in 1980 and left in
February after seven years of authoritarian rule, denies embezzling
public funds.
   Thousands of people took to the streets last week and battled
riot police to press for Chun's arrest. Dissidents plan more
protests this week.
   The mounting public pressure caused the ruling Democratic Justice
Party to persuade Chun to atone for his misrule, surrender his
wealth and move out of Seoul to live in the countryside, party
officials said.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, violent protests broke out in
downtown streets after college students attacked a government tax
office with firebombs and rocks, according to Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency. No injuries were reported.
   High school students and grade-school kids in Kwangju joined
protesters, Yonhap said, adding bands of youths armed with firebombs
and rocks battled riot police, shouting ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!''
and ``Drive out U.S. imperialists!''
   Chun also is under parliamentary investigation for his alleged
role in putting down a 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju in which
nearly 200 people were killed. Dissidents claim the United States
condoned the South Korean army's suppression of the uprising.
   Also on Tuesday, police arrested eight students who briefly
occupied a government prosecutor's building in the central city of
Taejon and demanded Chun's arrest.

   Neither snow, nor wind nor midnight

   The townsfolk trooped to the polls in a room at the Balsams

election since the early 1970s.
   Results showed they favored Republican George Bush over Democrat
Michael Dukakis 34-3, with one write-in vote for Rep. Jack Kemp of
New York, a conservative who had sought his party's presidential
nomination.
   Dixville Notch, located in extreme northern New Hampshire, has 28

<HEAD>DiPrete's Son Arrested For Tearing Down Sundlun Campaign Signs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 21-year-old son of Rhode Island's
Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly
tearing down a sign belonging to his father's Democratic opponent
from the second story of a house.
   But campaign workers for Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun were also
red-faced after they were caught pulling down DiPrete's signs,
officials said.
   The two candidates have been competing fiercely in a close race.
   Thomas DiPrete was arrested on charges of malicious mischief
after Richard Simons, an auctioneer, said he saw DiPrete face to
face through his second-story window. Simons said the Providence
College student climbed scaffolding outside his East Side house.
   DiPrete was arrested and ordered to appear in court Nov. 15,
according to the police report. Simons said he would not press
charges. Providence police would not comment.
   ``I have severly reprimanded my son Thomas,'' the governor said.
``He has gone at my request to the Sundlun headquarters personally
to apologize for what he did, to make restitution and offer to put
the sign up.''
   John Taylor, a staffer in the governor's press office, caught two
of Sundlun's campaign staffers tearing DiPrete signs off telephone
polls, said DiPrete spokeswoman Nanci Martin.

   George Bush was the favored favorite son of Texas
going into Tuesday's presidential election, but polls showed the
other Texan on the national ballot, Lloyd Bentsen, leading in his
second race _ for re-election to the U.S. Senate.
   Final opinion polls showed the Republican with a double-digit
lead in his adopted home state over Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis. The Massachusetts governor chose Bentsen as his
running mate in a bid to win Texas' 29 electoral votes, the
third-largest haul in the country.
   Bentsen, up for a fourth term, consistently led in his Senate
contest against Rep. Beau Boulter, who was outspent almost 6-to-1.
   In congressional races, Democrats were hoping to pick up one or
two seats to expand their 17-10 lead in the Texas delegation in the
U.S. House.

   Texas' best-known congressman, House Speaker Jim Wright, was
headed for his 18th term with no opposition in his Fort Worth
district, despite being the target of a House Ethics Committee
investigation.
   Democrats urged Texans to vote for Bentsen twice. The double
entry was permitted under a 1959 law passed to allow Lyndon Johnson
to seek re-election to the Senate and run for the White House at the
same time.
   In choosing Bentsen as his ticketmate, Dukakis tried to revive
the 1960 ``Boston-Austin axis,'' when John F. Kennedy chose Johnson
as his vice presidential nominee. But several Democratic politicians
noted that Bentsen's double entry allowed his Texas supporters to
vote for Bush and still vote for Bentsen, on the Senate line.
   Bush, born in Massachusetts, maintains a hotel suite in Houston
that he claims as his voting address.

<HEAD>U.S. Skeptical Of Vietnamese Promise Of Pullout From Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is doubtful that Vietnam will
keep its promise to pull 50,000 troops out of Cambodia this year,
and the Soviet Union has refused to press its Vietnamese allies for
a detailed withdrawal timetable, the State Department said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said Assistant Secretary of State Gaston
Sigur and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev discussed the
matter last week. The two met for 10 hours in Paris to discuss the
Cambodian situation and the recent thaw between North and South
Korea, he said.
   In an unrelated development, Redman announced that Sigur had
canceled a planned trip to Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul because of
``pressing business here.'' He declined to elaborate and said he did
not know whether the visit would be rescheduled.
   Those governments will be briefed on the Sigur-Rogachev meeting
by other U.S. officials, he said.
   Sigur urged Rogachev to press Vietnam for an exact timetable on
the withdrawal from Cambodia, Redman told reporters.
   ``The Soviet side expressed confidence that Vietnamese military
forces will be out of Cambodia by early 1990, but declined to make a
commitment to urge Hanoi to adopt a detailed withdrawal timetable,''
the spokesman said.
   Earlier this year Vietnam said it would pull all its estimated
120,000 troops from Cambodia by 1990, 50,000 of them by the end of
this year. But Redman said that since June 1, only 10,000 to 15,000
have left.
   ``There are signs that Vietnam is preparing to withdraw more
troops in coming months, but we remain skeptical that the 50,000
pledge will be met,'' Redman said.
   U.S. officials were hoping that a Vietnamese timetable would help
move forward talks between the three major opposition groups and the
Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia on a peace settlement.
   The United States is especially seeking to prevent a return to
power of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, a faction that ruled
Cambodia in the late 1970s and is believed to have killed as many as
1 million Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge is one of the three major
opposition groups conducting the talks on the country's future.
   Sigur ``emphasized the importance of effective safeguards to
prevent the Khmer Rouge from regaining control of Cambodia, and the
need for an international presence to monitor any settlement,''
Redman said.
   ``Both the United States and the Soviet Union are prepared, along
with other countries, to participate in international guarantees,
and favor international monitoring of the implementation of
agreements among the parties to the conflict,'' he added.
   The United States had hoped that a credible Vietnamese pullout
schedule would put pressure on China to end its support for the
Khmer Rouge. The Soviet Union, in talks expected to lead to the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years, has also discussed with the
matter with the Chinese.

<HEAD>Villagers Pray For `Michalis' Miracle in Dukakis Hometown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PELOPI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this mountain village that
calls itself the hometown of Michael Dukakis gathered around cafe
radios Tuesday night, clinging to hopes of a Democratic victory in
the U.S. presidential election.
   Earlier in the day, several hundred villagers dressed in their
Sunday best made a pilgrimage to a whitewashed 18th century
monastery six miles from Pelopi to kiss a silver-plated icon of St.
Michalis.
   The election coincided with the Nov. 8 feast-day of St. Michalis
_ Greek for Michael _ who is the patron saint of Pelopi. The village
is located on the northern Aegean island of Mytilene, also known as
Lesvos.
   ``I lit a candle for Michalis and said a prayer for his electoral
success, but whether he wins or not he has made Greece and our
village proud,'' said Costas Stefanou, the president of the village
council.
   Dukakis, whose grandfather was born in Pelopi, is known as
Michalis to villagers who met him during a brief visit to the island
in 1976.
   Stefanou said he had been ``more than optimistic'' about Dukakis'
chances, but other villagers were less hopeful as they waited for
the returns.
   ``We're a bit discouraged by the latest polls and we'll be in
despair if he doesn't win,'' said Efstratios Patsis, the village
butcher, as he downed a glass of ouzo.
   The villagers gathered around wood-burning stoves in three cafes,
toasting each other with ouzo to keep out the cold.
   Stefanou said that no matter what the outcome, Dukakis would be
offered a plot of land in Pelopi for a summer home. He said the
village also had made plans to build a hotel _ ``50 rooms if he
wins, smaller if he doesn't.''
   Dukakis' cousins on the island, who all live in Mytilene town,
also awaited the election results via radio.
   ``We're hoping that Michalis has been able to catch up enough
over the final days to win,'' said Elly Petridou, a second cousin.
   In Athens, the Friends of Michael Dukakis organization held an
election watch in their offices, with telephone links to the
Massachusetts governor's campaign headquarters.
   The group helped more than 30,000 Americans living in Greece with
registering to vote in the U.S. elections.
   ``Their votes may be very important, since many of these people
were registering in states like California, New York, and Ohio which
are crucial to the outcome,'' said Nikos Revezoulis, the group's
chairman.
   Many Athenians stayed up late to watch the election results on
satellite television channels which started broadcasting to Greece
just two weeks ago.
   Several thousand people attended an all-night election watch at
an Athens hotel organized by Greek Americans and American
expatriates with help from the U.S. Embassy.
   Dukakis was the favored candidate over Vice President George Bush
by a wide margin among American voters living in Athens.
   ``This time we've been lucky to catch a 20 percent Republican
vote in Greece because of the local factor,'' said Katy Angelis of
Republicans Abroad International.

   Scores of novice anglers are attracted to a
course at Valdosta State College that allows students to earn
college credits while fishing.
   Titled Freshwater Fishing 315, the course is filled to capacity
each quarter with students who want to bait hooks and reel in
catfish, bluegill, perch and bass.
   ``It's a fun course,'' said instructor Lindy Evans, 45. ``The
homework is excellent _ meaning go fishing.''
   Evans covers all the basics of the sport, from matching rods with
reels to selecting appropriate fishing lines, lures, hooks and bait.
His classes also focus on techniques for catching fish.
   Before graduating from the course, students make one or two
visits to fishponds in the area to test their skills.
   Evans' two-credit-hour course is sponsored by the college's
Physical Education Department as a leisure activity, a category that
also includes such things as golf and tennis.

   Want a take-out supper? Maybe the hospital
could suit your palate.
   Hospital food may not have the world's greatest reputation, but
Lawrence Memorial Hospital, for one, is promoting a new frozen
dinner that it says offers healthy, tasty and quick eating.
   On Monday, the hospital began selling ``Light and Right''
dinners, created especially for sale through hospitals by Baxter
Health Care of Chicago.
   The meals, similar to those sold in grocery stores, are low in
calories, sodium, fat and cholesterol, said Nancy Donahey, dietitian
at the hospital.
   She said the meals are largely for the convenience of people
going home from the hospital on special diets.
   ``It may be the answer for their recuperation period when they
are not able to get up and prepare meals,'' she said.
   However, the dietary office at the hospital will sell the meals
to the public as well. Hospital employees were recently treated to a
sampling, and Judith Hefley, director of community relations, said,
``I liked them, actually.''

   It started with the sending of a few pictures to
people on the other end of his fax line, but Paul Hohendorf got into
correspondence in a big way after his story appeared in a Chicago
newspaper.
   Hohendorf, 33, is vice president of Roostertail catering in
Detroit, and the office facsimile machine normally is used for
business. Sometimes, his business dealings are with women.
   ``I get to know people and talk to them maybe 50 times, and I
send them a picture of myself,'' he said. In one instance, Hohendorf
said he met a woman who ended up accompanying him on a trip to New
York.
   A Chicago Sun-Times column earlier in the week detailed
Hohendorf's fax exchanges and published the number. Hohendorf got
300 responses from Chicago women.
   ``We had to hire an extra secretary just to staple fax papers
together,'' said Hohendorf's boss, Tom Schoenith.
   ``Let's see what you got, big guy,'' one message read.
   ``I can't believe it: I get to pick and choose _ finally _ my
women,'' Hohendorf said. He said he plans to put together a party in
Chicago to meet his new fax friends.

   Rebecca Beasley was late getting to the polls in Dexter, Iowa,
because the horse got loose.
   Scott Arrington warmed his hands with a cup of hot coffee as he
waited in the dark to vote in Kearns, Utah, attracted in part by a
hot campaign over a tax-cutting proposal.
   ``I've had a habit of sitting back and complaining about state
government, so at least this way I know I spoke out by voting,''
said the 30-year-old carpenter and father of two.
   In the devastated South Bronx in New York City, only one voter
had turned out at the 69th Election District by mid-morning, but
poll worker Mercedes Quinones promised at least four more from her
family would participate. ``Six, if my in-laws come,'' she said.
   It was morning in America, Election Day 1988. Time to make
choices _ for president, for U.S. representative, for a senator in
33 states, and for countless local candidates and ballot issues.
   The voting began in the wind-blown snow of Dixville Notch, N.H.,
at midnight and ended 25 hours later on blustery Adak Island in
Alaska, a ritual of democracy that spanned the continent and the
generations.
   In Brownsville, Texas, 59-year-old Beto Jimenez cast his first
vote as an American citizen. ``It seems there is not much enthusiasm
for voting,'' Jimenez said. ``I think the Mexican-Americans have
more enthusiasm for voting than the Americans.''
   In Fostoria, Ohio, 98-year-old Harry Sprout cast his 20th ballot
for president _ dating back to 1912 when he helped put Democrat
Woodrow Wilson in the White House. Who this time? The venerable
voter wouldn't say. Sprout's secret ballot stayed secret.
   Laura Brace, 95, was out early to vote in Huntingburg, Ind., but
couldn't match Sprout's string. She voted for the first time in
1920, when Republican Warren G. Harding was the winner _ the first
presidential election in which women participated.
   ``They called it women's suffrage at that time. Yes, I thought
that was a big deal,'' Mrs. Brace said.
   Tommy Caudill, 81, of Waynesfield, Ohio, recalled selling his
vote _ as many as 30 times in one election _ during the Depression.
This year, he said he was casting his first legal ballot _ he hadn't
voted since the 1940s _ to help a friend in her campaign for a state
judgeship.
   ``A lot of people died for this right,'' said Michael Campanile,
74, who voted at Sunrise Lakes Satellite Clubhouse No. 5 in Sunrise,
Fla. ``A lot of our own people died overseas,'' the World War II
veteran said.
   In Dixville Notch, 34 of the 38 votes went to Republican George
Bush. Michael Dukakis got three votes _ in a town with six
registered Democrats _ and Republican Rep. Jack Kemp got the other.
   Dixville Notch was incorporated in 1960 strictly for purposes of
voting. At midnight, voters who took refuge from the snow and cold
to cast ballots at The Balsams resort were nearly outnumbered by
reporters.
   ``Whether it's the first vote or the last vote doesn't make any
difference,'' Neil Tillotson, the 89-year-old town moderator, said
before casting the first ballot.
   Three presidents _ John Adams, John Quincy Adams and John F.
Kennedy _ were born in Norfolk County, Mass., and both Bush and
Dukakis were born there, too.
   But the talk at the Oakdale Elementary School gym in Dedham,
where refreshments were served under the basketball hoop, was about
dress.
   ``We were going to get dressed up to vote, but we wanted to take
a walk and then go to work. That's the new age,'' said Kay Riley,
whose red sweatsuit matched the one worn by her husband, James.
   ``When I grew up, you had to have a necktie and a shirt and a
jacket to vote. You wouldn't come casual,'' said Hank Persson, 67, a
retired sales manager for a shoe company, who wore a tan suit and
brown tie.
   For some, it was an important social occasion.
   ``The only time I see some of these people is weddings, funerals
and voting, '' said Edward Hartnett, 76, a retired postal foreman
who wore a red, white and blue ``U.S.A.'' cap.
   In Southmost, a heavily Hispanic neighborhood near the Rio Grande
in Brownsville, Democratic posters appealed, ``Dale Gas con
Dukakis-Bentsen'' (``Give it the gas with Dukakis-Bentsen'').
   Wanda Chiles, a hairdresser in Spangle, Wash., felt a sense of
relief at her polling place. ``It's nice to have it over with,'' she
said with a grin, ``and I hope it continues to be over with soon.''
Why? ``Because it was a dirty campaign.''
   At P.S. 29 in the South Bronx, voting inspector Rachel Dorson
wasn't suprised by the low turnout.
   ``This is choice?'' she said, taking a reporter to an empty
voting booth and pointing to the line for state Supreme Court
justice. The candidates were Burton C. Hecht, Democrat; Burton C.
Hecht, Republican; Burton C. Hecht, Conservative Party, and Burton
C. Hecht, Liberal Party.
   Paul Gresante, standing on line at a fire station in Malibu,
Calif., had a celebrity scoop. ``Sean is registered but Madonna
isn't,'' said Gresante, who lives next door to the famous Penns but
said his information came second-hand from a neighborhood canvasser.
   Sam Dowey was a glum Democrat as he waited to vote at the Malibu
Park School auditorium. ``The Dukakis group really blew it,'' he
said. ``If he was to run the country like this campaign we'd be in
trouble.''
   Asked why he was voting for Dukakis anyway, Dowey said, ``I had
to kill my wife's vote.''

<HEAD>Bank Regulator to Set Rules on Financing Leveraged Buyouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
is preparing guidelines requiring nationally chartered banks to more
carefully consider their involvement in leveraged buyouts.
   Within the next several weeks, the agency will be sending new
guidelines to its examiners and to banks to help them evaluate when
an institution is vulnerable because of highly leveraged lending,
said Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for Comptroller Robert Clarke. His
office regulates 4,450 of the nation's 13,400 commercial banks.
   In a leveraged buyout or LBO, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co.'s $20.6 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group
borrows heavily in order to buy out stockholders and take over the
company.
   Often the investment group is composed of the target company's
management, which is acting to thwart a threatened takeover by
outsiders. The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off
pieces of the company to pay back the loans.
   The popularity of such deals and the resulting proliferation of
debt has led to growing concern about the prospects of heavily
burdened companies in an economic downturn.
   Critics of leveraged buyouts say most of the deals have been put
together since 1982, when the economy began expanding, and have not
been tested by a recession.
   If a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn, the value of
its stock falls. However, a highly leveraged company suffering a
setback could be forced into bankruptcy to pay creditors.
   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company that monitors
large bank loans to corporations, banks have lent $70 billion to
highly leveraged transactions since mid-1987. LBOs and takeover
lending comprised 59 percent of the banks' big corporate loans in
the July-September quarter.
   Last month, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose
agency regulates bank holding companies, told the Senate Banking
Committee that he had warned banks making leveraged buyout loans to
consider borrowers' prospects ``in a range of economic and financial
circumstances.''
   Ms. Cross said the comptroller's office began revising its
leveraged buyout guidelines after surveying the practices of 11
large money center banks and five regional institutions in late
spring and early summer.
   ``We found that so far the banks that have been involved seem to
have taken a pretty reasonable approach. Our concern now is going
forward as competition in this area heats up,'' the spokeswoman
said. ``No bank was perfect ... but we did not see any really
substantial problems.''
   The new examiniation guidelines will not impose limits on LBO
lending, but Ms. Cross said they will direct examiners to determine
if a banks' policies include limits on LBO lending as a whole and
limits for single deals.
   She said examiners also will be checking to see if banks are
establishing adequate reserves against expected LBO losses and
whether they have systems in place to adequately track the
performance of the loans.
   ``We want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis of
exactly what the risks are,'' she said.
   Another concern is that large banks often sell interests in the
loans to smaller institutions, which should be doing their own
independent credit analysis rather than relying on the originating
bank, the spokeswoman said.
   One problem in developing the guidelines is that banks have
widely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveraged
lending, she said.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is working on a definition
of highly leveraged debt, which will be ready in several months,
said spokesman Peter Bakstansky. It could serve as guidance to other
federal regulators.

<HEAD>Austrian Says Instability, Anti-Semitism Paved Way for Nazi Terror</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political instability and anti-Semitism in
Austria helped pave the way for the annihilation of Jews that began
with the violence of Kristallnacht 50 years ago, Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky said Tuesday.
   Nazi thugs ran rampant on the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, in
Germany and Austria, which Adolf Hitler had annexed to his Third
Reich eight months before. They burned synagogues and shops, killed
scores of Jews and arrested thousands for deportation to
concentration camps.
   The Nazis named it Crystal Night, boastfully, for the shattered
glass that littered the streets.
   Austria's head of state normally would give a nationally
broadcast address and attend other events on such an anniversary,
but President Kurt Waldheim has been accused of involvement in Nazi
atrocities.
   He issued a statement through his press office saying ``the
devastation and destruction'' of Kristallnacht ``as well as the
mishandling and the horrific deaths of numerous people showed the
regime of that time in its entire brutality.''
   ``The nearly complete expulsion and destruction of the Jewish
people has left deep wounds in the country up to the present day,''
Waldheim said.
   Vienna had 180,000 Jews on that night that began the
extermination of 6 million European Jews by Adolf Hitler, who was
born in Austria. About 7,000 now live in the city.
   In West Berlin, 5,000 people held a solemn procession to mark the
anniversary. Communist East Germany observed it by honoring Jewish
leaders.
   Avi Weiss, an American rabbi and outspoken opponent of Waldheim,
said the Austrian observances are hypocritical while he is president.
   Weiss, who came to Vienna for the occasion, said: ``it is a false
commemoration, since 50 years after the event strong elements of
Nazism remain here.'' He called Waldheim ``an unrepentant ex-Nazi.''
   Vranitzky took over the ceremonial duties because of the
controversy about Waldheim, who was a German army lieutenant in the
Balkans during World War II but denies committing war crimes.
   An international panel of historians said it found no evidence of
Waldheim's direct involvement, but left the question of guilt open.
   On Kristallnacht, 42 synagogues were completely destroyed in
Vienna alone. The city now has only one.
   In a speech to his Cabinet broadcast nationally on radio,
Vranitzky said at least 27 Jews were killed in Vienna, 88 seriously
injured and 6,547 arrested.
   Looking back on this year of anniversaries, including that of the
``Anschluss'' with Hitler's Germany, Vranitzky said Austria had
``sincerely tried to understand the truth.''
   ``We have learned to differentiate between our role as the victim
of a military aggression and the culpable involvement of many
Austrians who more or less voluntarily were prepared to do the dirty
work ... for an inhuman and criminal regime,'' the chancellor
declared.
   ``We must be careful not to perceive this night of horror as a
single event,'' he said, because ``too much happened in the
preceding years and the path had already been paved.''
   Vranitzky cited events of 1918-38: the end of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, establishment of the Austrian republic,
the ``deep uncertainty of the Austrians, the doubt over the state's
ability to exist (and) the economic and social destitution.''
   He said Austria owes it the victims ``not to end this
commemoration year on Dec. 31. We want to keep in our heads and in
our hearts the content of what we have worked through in this
commemoration year, also in the future.''
   Waldheim's statement warned against spreading ``a cloak of
silence'' over the Nazi years.
   ``The commemoration of this pogrom and the suffering of the Jews
during the era of National Socialism (Nazism) must be a warning and
a charge ... to prevent anything similar from ever happening
again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Says Contras `Far From Defeat'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Contra leader insisted Tuesday that the Nicaraguan
rebels are far from defeat despite the cutoff of U.S. aid, their
mass retreat to Honduras and the pessimism of some of their own
leaders.
   The divided rebel movement has appeared stalled since Congress
voted to cut off military aid in deference to the Central American
peace plan sponsored by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez.
   Contra Director Alfredo Cesar last month called for further peace
talks with the Sandinistas, saying the military fight against
Nicaragua's leftist rulers is no longer viable.
   But on Tuesday, Wilfredo Montalvan, another of the Contras' seven
directors, strenuously denied the rebels have lost their war against
the Sandinistas.
   ``Some believe we suffered a hard blow with the suspension of
U.S. military aid, but we are far from being defeated,'' Montalvan
said.
   The Contras, he emphasized, are not merely instruments of U.S.
policy in Central America, to be discarded when they are no longer
useful in pressuring the Sandinista government.
   ``We cannot and should not permit our people to continue
sacrificing themselves only for pressure,'' Montalvan warned. ``That
is immoral. When wars are waged, it is to win or to lose, nothing
else.''
   He called for renewed military aid to the Contras, saying the
Soviet Union was giving the Sandinistas $40 million a month. And he
said he would meet with whoever wins the U.S. presidential election
to get a definition of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua.
   Since the aid cutoff, the vast majority of Contra troops, as many
as 10,000, have retreated from Nicaragua in favor of camps along the
Honduran border.
   Their host, Honduras' President Jose Azcona Hoyo, said last week
the lack of military aid had resulted in ``the defeat of the
Nicaraguan Contras.''
   The movement, known formally as the Nicaraguan Resistance, has
long been divided between hard-line and moderate factions, and now
they no longer appear to be communicating with each other.
   ``Many in the resistance see now this isn't working; the
resistance is withering, this is lost,'' said former Contra
spokeswoman Marta Sacasa, who lost her job to the hard-line wing
earlier this year.
   But the Contras' current spokesman, Bosco Matamoros, dismisses
the divergent views within the movement as simply ``an exploration
of new strategies.''
   And he insists that the rebel army, despite its problems, remains
viable.
   ``Our forces are still intact,'' he said. ``There is still
command and control.''

   Police questioned one man Tuesday and
searched a heavily wooded area of Faulkner County for suspects in
the shooting death of a Conway policeman.
   Ray Noblitt, 42, of Vilonia, an 11-year veteran of the force, was
shot late Monday, authorities said.
   Police Chief Vonnie Taylor said Noblitt had stopped to
investigate a suspicious vehicle at Loveless Tractor Co. He said
someone apparently was trying to steal a trailer or a
tractor-trailer rig.
   After the shooting, the suspects fled north on a U.S. highway,
police said. The Faulkner County Sheriff's Department set up
roadblocks during the night on that highway and another road.
   ``We still don't know how many suspects that there are. We feel
there are more than one,'' said Conway officer Kerry Pool.
   Officials searched Tuesday near the community of Barney, about 15
miles northeast of Conway, which is about 20 miles north of Little
Rock.
   ``It's very rural. If you blink your eyes, you miss it. It's
heavily wooded,'' said Pool.
   The man in custody was questioned, ``but not necessarily in
connection with the shooting itself,'' Pool said. He declined to
name the man.
   Taylor said Noblitt was shot after he got out of his car.
   ``We believe he returned fire,'' the police chief said. ``We
haven't checked his weapon, so we're not sure.''
   Police were notified of the shooting when someone used the
officer's police radio to call the station.

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne,'' Roseanne Barr's new
blue-collar comedy of wedded strife, grabbed second place behind
traditional leader NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings for the week ended Nov. 6.
   The show, in only its third outing, nosed out such usual
front-runners as NBC's ``A Different World'' and ``The Golden
Girls'' and CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' The previous week, ``Roseanne''
was in eighth place. It made its debut in fifth place during NBC's
World Series coverage.
   NBC, which retained first place, took five top slots. The
network's new comedy ``Empty Nest'' was in the Top 10, but the
highly touted ``Dear John,'' another new entry, dropped out of the
top rank and placed 16th. The new drama ``Tattingers'' plunged to
54th place after placing 26th the week before.
   Two chapters of NBC's political thriller, ``Favorite Son,'' were
in the Top 20. The second part tied for 19th place with CBS' ``Knots
Landing'' and the third part was 16th. The first chapter of another
NBC miniseries, ``The Great Escape II: The Untold Story,'' was 27th.
   Part one of CBS' ``Internal Affairs,'' broadcast Sunday, was
17th. The two-part miniseries features Richard Crenna reprising the
role of world-weary detective Frank Janek from an earlier
miniseries, ``Doubletake.''
   The second part of the CBS miniseries ``Dadah Is Death'' was 52nd.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 14.6. ABC was second
with 13.0 and CBS was third with 12.7. A ratings point represents
904,000 homes with television. The share is a percentage of the sets
in use.
   NBC also led in the opening days of the November sweeps. In five
days counted by Arbitron the ratings were NBC 14.5, CBS 13.2, ABC
12.0. In four days counted by Nielsen the ratings were NBC 15.1, CBS
13.7 and ABC 11.3. For the season to date, NBC leads with a rating
of 16.7. ABC is second with 13.1 and CBS is third with 12.1.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ABC's
``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``A Different World'' and CBS' ``60 Minutes''
tied, NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss,'' NBC's
``Cheers,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and
ABC's ``Growing Pains.''
   The Moscow visit of ABC's ``Head of the Class'' was 13th.
   ``Roseanne,'' ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John'' were the only new
shows in the Top 20. The next highest-rated new show was NBC's
``Baby Boom'' in 48th place. ABC's ``Mission: Impossible'' was 49th.
Most of the new shows finished near the bottom of the ratings.
   The return of Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, once one of
America's most popular TV couples, in back-to-back shows on CBS is
looking more and more like only a short visit. ``The Van Dyke Show''
was in a three-way tie for 61st place and Moore's ``Annie McGuire''
was 64th.
   CBS had the lead among the evening news shows. The ratings: CBS
11.7, ABC 10.9, NBC 10.2.
   The lowest-ranked show in 70th place was NBC's ``Decision '88.''
Here are the five bottom shows: ABC's ``88 Vote,'' CBS' ``West 57th
Street,'' CBS' ``Raising Miranda,'' ``CBS' ``Simon & Simon'' and
NBC's ``Decision '88.''

   Republican Connie Mack, conservative grandson of a
Baseball Hall of Famer, and Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, a Democrat
loaded down with endorsements, battled Tuesday for a U.S. Senate
seat from Florida.
   It was a test of George Bush's coattails, since the Republican
vice president was confident of claiming Florida's 21 electoral
votes in his presidential race against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   MacKay called himself the logical successor to the retiring Sen.
Lawton Chiles, a three-term Democrat. Mack's late-campaign strategy
was based on Bush's large lead in the Florida opinion polls, and on
President Reagan's popularity here.
   Floridians also voted on a proposition to make English the
official state language, a measure controversial in a state with a
large Hispanic population.

<TEXT>
   Mack, 48, a former Cape Coral bank president, and MacKay, 55, an
Ocala lawyer, both were elected to the U.S. House in 1982. They
offered different philosophies and styles.
   Mack's campaign commercials often had the tag line: ``Hey Buddy,
You're Liberal,'' and President Reagan did a five-minute satellite
feed for Mack on Monday that charged MacKay had a record that was
``liberal, liberal, liberal.''
   MacKay blasted Mack as an ideologue with a far-right agenda that
was ``anti-Florida.'' He cited his endorsements from senior
citizens' groups, children's advocates, women's groups, teachers,
the state Fraternal Order of Police, and 27 of 30 Florida daily
newspapers that made recommendations.
   MacKay jumped into the Senate race after longtime ally Reubin
Askew, former two-term governor, dropped out. The ensuing six-way
Democratic race led to a runoff in which MacKay defeated 1980 Senate
nominee Bill Gunter.
   Mack had gotten into what appeared to be a longshot race against
Chiles in October 1987. He is the namesake of a grandfather who was
the beloved owner and manager of the Philadelphia Athletics baseball
team.

<HEAD>9,000 Tourists Evacuated After Theatened Hotel Attacks By
Extremists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese extremists threatened to
attack resort hotels on Sri Lanka's south coast, prompting the
evacuation of nearly 9,000 foreign tourists, officials said.
   A senior official of the government tourist board called the
evacuation an ``unnecessary panic.'' The government and embassies
denied reports that all foreign tourists were advised to leave the
country.
   The tourist official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the board only had instructed tourists to avoid travel in the south.
He said southern hotels had been advised to transfer their guests
north to Colombo and Negombo.
   Most of the evacuated tourists were from West Germany, Britain,
France and Italy.
   The tourist board issued its warning after 10 hotels in the
Kalutara district received leaflets or telephone calls threatening
attacks unless the tourists left. The district is 25 miles south of
Colombo, the capital.
   Hotel staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
threats were issued by the People's Liberation Front.
   The front called a four-day strike starting Monday to press its
demands for the resignation of President Junius R. Jayewardene and
his government. Most businesses heeded the strike call.
   Authorities have blamed the radical Sinhalese group for the
killings of more than 550 people, mostly Sinhalese who support the
government, in the last 15 months.
   The government said the front had killed 16 people in a series of
attacks in southern and central Sri Lanka on Monday and Tuesday.
   The front is not known to have singled out any foreigners since
it launched a series of bombings and assassinations following the
government's announcement of a peace accord for the island nation's
Tamil ethnic minority on July 29, 1987.
   The front denounced the accord, saying President Junius R.
Jayewardene, a Sinhalese, had sold out the interests of the
Sinhalese majority in his attempts to pacify Tamil separatist
guerrillas.
   More than 8,000 people _ mostly Sinhalese _ have been killed
since Tamil rebel groups mounted their campaign of civilian
massacres and attacks against the government in 1983.
   The mainly Hindu Tamils, who compose about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population, say they are discriminated against by
the Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   Tourism this year is running about 50 percent below what it was
before ethnic tensions turned violent in 1983.
   Despite the trouble, Sri Lanka's beaches and mountain retreats
have drawn 200,000 foreign visitors so far this year, compared with
182,000 for all of 1987, according to tourist board figures.
   The evacuated tourists filled hotels in Colombo and in the beach
resorts in Negombo, 20 miles north of Colombo.
   Negombo's mixed population of Sinhalese and Tamils have lived
peacefully together for many decades.

   The high-level advisory commission on the
federal budget deficit, beset by deep divisions among panel members,
may delay issuing its recommendations for several months, the
co-chairman of the group said Tuesday.
   Democrat Robert Strauss, one of two leaders of the bipartisan
National Economic Commission, said the group's report may not be
issued until March 1 or later.
   This would mark a turnabout from the commission's original goal
of issuing its recommendations by Dec. 21, in time to influence the
first budget submitted by the incoming administration.
   Strauss, in a speech to an investment conference sponsored by the
American Stock Exchange and in later comments to reporters, said the
timing of the panel's report would be left up to the wishes of the
next president.
   Supporters of the 12-member commission, created by Congress last
December, believed that it offered the best hope of breaking through
the seven-year political deadlock over reducing the federal budget
deficit. The commission was expected to come up with a package of
spending cuts and tax increases that would be acceptable to the
White House and Congress.
   Congress gave the commission a deadline of March 1 for issuing
its recommendations. The law allows the next president to extend
that deadline to Sept. 1.
   However, at its first meeting last May, the commission announced
it had agreed to an accelerated schedule that would have a final
report completed by Dec. 21 so the panel's recommendations could
help shape the president-elect's first budget submission to Congress.
   Strauss' comments Tuesday were the first public confirmation of
reports that the commission would not meet that self-imposed
deadline.
   Strauss conceded that the panel was a ``rather stormy
commission'' and said ``we are going to have a hard time'' coming up
with an acceptable package.
   He said that while he was concerned, he was not pessimistic that
the commission would be able to draft a deficit-reduction plan by
the March 1 deadline or Sept. 1, if the new president decides to
extend the deadline.
   Two members of the panel, former defense secretaries Caspar
Weinberger and Donald Rumsfeld, have made it clear that they favor
faster growth in military spending than Congress has allowed while
at the same time they oppose higher taxes.
   Another panelist, Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm
Bureau Federation, has said in speeches that he would work to block
recommendations for tax increases.
   In comments to reporters after his speech, Strauss said he was
not totally ruling out an attempt by the commission to complete its
work by the Dec. 21 date, but he said such an effort would not be
launched without approval from the president-elect, who will appoint
the final two members of the panel.
   ``Whatever he wants, he can have,'' Strauss said of the
president-elect.
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush has been openly
skeptical of the commission, saying he would not accept
recommendations for tax increases.
   Strauss refused comment when asked about reports that he has
discussed the commission's role with Bush campaign chairman James A.
Baker III.

   A state where Democrats once hoped for landslide
numbers, New York instead became a cliffhanger Tuesday for Michael
Dukakis in his presidential battle against George Bush.
   But New York's two-term Democratic senator, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, appeared headed for an easy re-election over Republican
Robert McMillan.
   New York's 36 electoral votes, second-biggest prize after
California, were up for grabs, according to pollsters and political
professionals.
   Going into the election, Democrats held a 19-14 congressional
edge, with one vacancy created by the resignation of Bronx Democrat
Mario Biaggi following his Wedtech racketeering conviction.
   While Biaggi remained on the general election ballot on the
Republican line, he did not campaign and Democratic state
Assemblyman Eliot Engel was expected to capture the seat.
   Upstate, Republican Assemblyman L. William Paxon was favored over
Erie County Clerk David Swarts, a Democrat, for the Buffalo-area
House seat surrendered by former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jack Kemp
when he decided to run for the GOP presidential nomination.
   New Yorkers were also voting on Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo's $3
billion bond issue proposal for highway work.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   With Moynihan's seat appearing safe _ he had 10 times the money
of his challenger _ attention centered on the Dukakis-Bush struggle.
   In the campaign's early stages, with the popular Cuomo heading
his New York campaign and a 3-2 Democratic enrollment edge, Dukakis
appeared in little danger here.
   By mid-October, however, polls indicated Bush had a shot at New
York and Dukakis began devoting valuable campaign time to the state.
Meanwhile, Cuomo spent at least one day a week crisscrossing the
nation for Dukakis with stops in such key states as Texas,
California and Illinois.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service is considering
launching a high-speed money order service that would allow people
to transfer funds anywhere in the country almost instantly.
   The service would compete with Western Union's widely advertised
money transfer service.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said Tuesday that the agency
is preparing to file a request with the independent Postal Rate
Commission for permission to launch the new ``express money order''
service.
   The service would permit a customer to purchase a money order in
one office for delivery, ``within minutes,'' to someone in another
location, anywhere in the country.
   ``We plan to provide express money order service at postal
windows on a cash basis, through an 800, toll-free telephone number
with a major credit card and through qualified independent service
providers,'' Frank told the monthly meeting of the service's board
of governors.
   ``A postal express money order will, in effect, extend the
benefits of emergency funds transfer to virtually every American,
regardless of location or banking status, and we see this as a
valuable public service,'' Frank said.
   No date for filing the formal application to start the service
was disclosed, and consideration by the Postal Rate Commission can
take several months.
   Western Union's service permits consumers to transfer money
instantly among 12,000 outlets across the country.
   That service handled about 10 million transactions last year,
moving $3 billion from one place to another and netting the company
about $200 million in revenues, according to Western Union.
   Western Union officials had no immediate comment about the
potential competition from the Postal Service.

   A referendum on Maryland's unique gun control
law came down to a dead heat Tuesday after the most expensive
election campaign in the state's history.
   The battle over the gun law dominated a campaign that also
produced a close race between George Bush and Michael Dukakis for
Maryland's 10 electoral votes. Late opinion polls showed the
presidential contest too close to call.
   Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes was a strong favorite to win a
third term against Republican Alan L. Keyes. The eight incumbent
members of the House of Representatives were also favored to win
re-election. 6-2.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The gun law, passed last April, set up a nine-member board
appointed by the governor to prepare a list of handguns that could
be sold in the state. Maryland gun groups, with the backing of the
National Rifle Association, collected enough petition signatures to
force a referendum on the law.
   The bill was intended to ban Saturday Night Specials, cheap
handuns that supporters of the law say are often used by street
criminals and young teen-agers.
   Faced with early polls showing that almost 80 percent of voters
favored the law, the NRA mounted a $4-million-plus campaign to
convince Marylanders that the board could ban sales of all handguns,
a claim hotly disputed by supporters.
   Backers of the law had only about one-tenth as much money to
spend as the NRA, and by Election Day their early lead in the polls
had all but evaporated.
   Both sides said the outcome in Maryland could affect the future
of gun control efforts nationally.
   ``Either way it goes, it's going to have some impacts in other
states,'' said Richard Gaardiner, an NRA counsel in Washington.
   Michael Beard of the National Coalition to Ban Handguns called
the referendum ``the most significant vote in the last five to 10
years'' on gun control.

<HEAD>Court Postpones Execution of Sikhs For Gandhi Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India's Supreme Court Tuesday stayed the
executions of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, the United News of India reported.
   It was the third time the executions have been delayed.
   A two-judge panel granted the stay after hearing an appeal that
the men not be hanged until a murder charge filed by one of them is
investigated, the report said.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed at her New Delhi residence Oct. 31, 1984.
   Satwant Singh, who was convicted for pulling the trigger on the
weapon that killed her, charged that security men disarmed him and
the other alleged assassin, Beant Singh, then fired on them.
   Satwant Singh was injured in the shootout, and Beant Singh was
fatally wounded.
   All Sikhs have the name Singh, meaning ``lion'' in Punjabi, by
doctrine of the faith.
   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who was convicted of conspiracy in
Mrs. Gandhi's killing, were sentenced to death in 1986. The sentence
was upheld by the Delhi High Court last year and by the Supreme
Court in August.
   On Oct. 12, Satwant Singh filed a complaint in a magistrate's
court charging the security guards with murder and attempted murder.
The magistrate is to rule on it Nov. 15.
   The men first were scheduled to be hanged Oct. 19 in New Delhi's
Tihar jail, but the Supreme Court stayed the execution until Nov. 1,
then delayed it for another week.
   The Gandhi killing apparently was in revenge for an army raid the
prime minister ordered four months earlier on the Golden Temple in
Amritsar, the holiest Sikh shrine in the northern state of Punjab.
   The shrine was being used as a base by Sikh militants, who since
1982 have waged a violent campaign for a homeland in Punjab. At
least 1,200 people were killed in the raid, most of them Sikhs.
   Sikhs, who make up only 2 percent of India's 880 million people,
form a majority in Punjab and claim they are discriminated against
by the majority Hindus.
   More than 2,230 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
Sikh violence this year.

   A woman whose newborn baby was abducted
from her arms at a hospital by a phony nurse went home Tuesday, and
authorities said they were no closer to finding the frail infant.
   A week after the kidnapping at Doctors Hospital, Annette
Thomas-Jones appealed to the woman who took the baby to ``call a
friend, call the police, call a minister and tell them ... `I've
done something wrong.'''
   Ten-day-old Christopher Michael Jones was born six weeks
premature. Doctors have said he could die if he did not get proper
medical attention.
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones, 32, called for a nationwide effort to find her
child.
   ``It's a matter of a whole country being involved. This is
something that could happen to anyone,'' she said.
   Flashing a brief, subdued smile when she and her husband, Willie
Jones, 39, appeared at a hospital news conference Tuesday, she said
she would never give up hope that her son would be found.
   ``I leave with a charge to continue the search, continue the
fight. Once my health gets to the stage where I can physically, if
it's necessary, search every home in Little Rock, I'm going to find
my child,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones, who previously had maintained her composure in
public, then broke into tears. Later, outside the hospital, she
sobbed freely.
   Authorities said a woman dressed in a white sweater and white
pleated skirt and posing as a nurse went to Mrs. Thomas-Jones' room
on the night of Nov. 1 and took the baby, saying he needed to be
weighed. A hospital employee discovered the baby missing about a
half-hour later and notified police.
   Police Lt. R.L. Jenkins said the police department had received
hundreds of calls about the case, but none had produced a
significant lead to the baby's whereabouts.
   ``A number of calls looked very promising when we got them, but
fizzled out,'' Jenkins said.
   ``At this point in time, to be perfectly candid, when that woman
left the hospital with that baby, we're not a whole lot closer to
finding the baby than we were then,'' Jenkins said.
   Hospital administrator Perry Kinder said a $26,500 reward being
offered for the baby's safe return would be in effect indefinitely.
He said the hospital would continue to provide assistance to the
family in keeping the case before the public ``as long as it takes.''
   He said that while Mrs. Thomas-Jones was sent home by her
doctors, her son would probably not have been well enough to have
accompanied her if he were still in the hospital's nursery.

   After a bitterly negative campaign,
Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg was favored to win a second term
Tuesday against Republican challenger and ex-football hero Peter
Dawkins.
   But Republicans appeared in far better shape in the presidential
race, in which George Bush was expected to defeat Michael Dukakis to
claim the state's 16 electoral votes.
   Opinion polling in May had shown Dukakis with a 14-point
advantage, but then the Democrat radically cut back his campaigning
here in an effort to outflank Bush elsewhere. The vice president,
meanwhile, visited the state eight times and built a commanding
lead, which rose to 19 points in a poll released Monday.
   In the 10th U.S. House district, Democrat Donald Payne of Newark
was considered an easy favorite to become the state's first black
congressman. The city councilman would replace Democrat Peter
Rodino, who is retiring after 40 years in the House.
   New Jersey currently has seven Democrats and six Republicans in
the House.

<TEXT>
   Lautenberg and Dawkins waged a harsh battle marked by sniping and
spending put at about $7.5 million. Only in the last two weeks did
they turn to issues, and debate about their ideological differences.
   Lautenberg accused Dawkins of deceiving voters, starting with a
lack of candor about his motive for moving to the state last year.
Dawkins said the senator mishandled his large personal fortune and
accused Lautenberg of using his office for personal gain.
   Dawkins, a 50-year-old retired Army general, ex-Rhodes Scholar
and Heisman Trophy winner as a West Point football player, reduced
Lautenberg's 20-point September lead, but still went into Tuesday's
voting with a 12-point deficit measured in a Monday poll.
   Lautenberg, a 64-year-old former computer tycoon, all but
declared victory in the last days of the race.

   George Bush appeared to be the slight favorite
over Michael Dukakis on Tuesday as Californians awarded the nation's
biggest batch of electoral votes _ 47 _ and settled 29 statewide
ballot issues ranging from AIDS to auto insurance.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson sought a second term against a
longshot Democratic challenger, Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, a race dubbed
the ``battle of the blands'' because neither candidate excited much
enthusiasm.
   Five conflicting initiatives on auto insurance reform, sponsored
by insurers, trial lawyers and consumer groups, were the subject of
a $76 million campaign, the most expensive state initiative contest
ever. Other ballot propositions included two AIDS-reporting measures
and a proposed 25-cents-per-pack cigarette tax hike.
   Little change was expected in the makeup of the congressional
delegation of 27 Democrats and 18 Republicans.

   Wilson, a former San Diego mayor who won his office in 1982 by
defeating former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was bucking a jinx that
has seen nearly 40 years go by without anyone winning re-election to
his Senate seat.
   Wilson led McCarthy by comfortable margins in every poll over the
past 21 months, with the final pre-election survey giving the
freshman Republican a 14-point edge.
   Bush had trailed Dukakis by margins of up to 17 percentage points
in every poll of California voters until their final debate in Los
Angeles Oct. 13. That catapulted Bush into a narrow lead which stood
at 6 percentage points in the final pre-election poll.
   Reagan, his popularity remaining high in his home state, made a
final campaign swing to California Monday on behalf of Bush.

   In the costliest Senate race in Ohio
history, liberal Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum was favored to
survive a challenge Tuesday from George Voinovich, Cleveland's
Republican mayor.
   Republican George Bush was expected to prevail over Democrat
Michael Dukakis in the contest for the state's 23 electoral votes.
   None of the 11 Democrats and nine Republicans seeking re-election
to the U.S. House was considered in danger.
   In the 5th District, Ohio Senate President Paul Gillmor, a
Republican, battled Sandusky lawyer Thomas Murray, a Democrat, for
the seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Delbert Latta after 30
years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Metzenbaum, aided by the Ohio Democratic Party and strong labor
backing, had spent more than $7 million in seeking a third term. The
71-year-old Cleveland millionaire said the race would be his last.
   Voinovich matched Metzenbaum in spending, but his campaign
nosedived after a television ad that sought to paint Metzenbaum as
soft on child pornographers. Newspapers statewide deplored the
tactic, and the Metzenbaum campaign answered with its own ad: a spot
in which fellow Democrat Sen. John Glenn called the Voinovich charge
``disgusting.''
   Bush and Dukakis campaigned right up to election eve in Ohio.
Bush had help from President Reagan, who made two campaign stops on
behalf of his vice president.

<HEAD>Israeli-backed Militia Kills Three Guerrillas in South Lebanon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's surrogate militia killed three
Palestinian guerrillas Thursday in south Lebanon and pro-Syrian
leftists said they expect Israeli retaliation for an attempt to
assassinate the militia's commander.
   Police said the dead guerrillas were members of the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council led by terrorist Abu Nidal, whose real
name is Sabry al-Banna.
   They were trying to infiltrate west of Jezzine, a Christian
mountain town controlled by the South Lebanon Army, a predominatnly
Christian force of 2,000 men led by Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, a
61-year-old former Lebanese army officer.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said he had no information about casualties among the
militiamen, who patrol Israel's ``security zone'' just north of the
border along with about 1,000 Israeli soldiers.
   Israeli army headquarters said there were no SLA casualties.
   A statement earlier Tuesday from the Lebanese National Resistance
Front, a coalition of Syrian-backed leftist groups, said it
anticipated ``an Israeli strike'' because Lahd was shot and wounded
Monday night.
   It said a woman member of the front shot Lahd with a pistol at
his home in Marjayoun, four miles north of the border in the Israeli
zone, which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles. She was captured
by Lahd's militiamen.
   Zvi Ben-Ishai, spokesman for the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, said
Lahd was in stable condition Tuesday after surgery on his right arm
and upper chest to repair a damaged blood vessel.
   In the pro-Syrian group's statement, the woman was identified as
Soha Fawaz Bishara, 21, a Christian teacher from Deir Mimas village
in the zone. The statement, accompanied by a photograph of Ms.
Bishara, said she was a member of the Lebanese Communist Party in
1982-1987 and then joined the front, which includes the communists.
   Beirut newspapers published the statement, which said the attack
on Lahd was in support of the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Lahd, a Maronite Catholic, took over the militia in September
1984 after his predecessor, Maj. Saad Haddad, died of cancer in
Israel. Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon in June
1985, after three years of invasion and occupation.
   The statement by the pro-Syrian group claimed Lahd was preparing
to declare an independent state in territory his militia holds to
support the government led by Lebanon's army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun.
   President Amin Gemayel named Aoun head of a caretaker Cabinet
when his six-year term expired Sept. 23 and Parliament had not
elected a successor.
   Christian lawmakers had boycotted Parliament, protesting
Syrian-backed Christian candidates on the grounds they would turn
Lebanon into a Syrian satellite.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem,
rejected Aoun's appointment and insisted his own Cabinet was the
legitimate authority. Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions
supported him, deepening Lebanon's partition along sectarian lines
after 13 years of civil war.
   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the prime
minister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.
   Voice of the South, the radio station of Lahd's militia, said Ms.
Bishara worked at a health club supported by the general's wife,
Minerva.
   It said Mrs. Lahd had invited her to tea Monday along with Caesar
Saqr, a militia spokesman, and Lahd's sons Rabih and Ron. When Lahd
got home at 8 p.m., it said, Ms. Bishara shot him twice.
   The radio said Ms. Bishara was being interrogated by
investigators for the militia in Marjayoun, the main city in the
security zone. Pro-communist pamphlets, leaflets and posters were
found at her house, the broadcast said.
   On Sunday, Lahd's militiamen killed three guerrillas near
Naqoura, about two miles north of the Israeli border. Israel said
the guerrillas were planning to attack a civilian target.

   A Brussels police strike spread
throughout the country Tuesday following a call by the National
Police Union.
   The strike began Monday in Brussels to back demands for better
pay and working conditions and more staff. The union said it would
affect administrative police services nationwide.
   For a second straight day, Brussels police answered only calls
for help if lives were at stake or did basic administrative work but
dropped routine patrol or traffic control work.
   The action spread to two Brussels suburbs and to Antwerp, where
patrol cars circled the city but did not report their location.
   Brussels Mayor Herve Brouhon asked for an emergency meeting with
Interior Minister Louis Tobback on the strike.
   The National State police joined in the protest, although not in
the walkout, saying in a statement released by its union that
``there can be no efficient State Police nor sufficient security if
state policemen are discredited on professional, family and social
levels.''
   The State Police union implied the corps could also go on strike
and would not replace striking city policemen or prison guards.

<HEAD>Soccer Fan Says British Felt Threatened by Italians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of 26 Liverpool soccer fans charged
with manslaughter in a stadium riot told a court Tuesday the
defendants had ``every reason'' to attack Italian fans.
   Thirty-nine people were killed in the May 28 riot at the European
Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus of Turin, Italy, at the
Heysel stadium.
   ``Britons should never have been given access to the same part of
the stadium as the Italians,'' said Terence Wilson, 22. ``The police
were not up to the task.''
   ``We had every reason to attack the Italians,'' Wilson added,
``all the more since British supporters felt threatened, for they
were in smaller numbers.''
   Among those criticized for improperly organizing the match were
the mayor of Brussels, his deputy, the president of the Belgian
Soccer Union and two top officials of the European Soccer Union.
   Officials had tried to separate the Italians from the Britons by
selling tickets to different parts of the stadium and setting up a
fence between the two sides.
   But, as several Liverpool fans have testified, the Britons ended
up in the Italian camp after buying tickets on the black market.
   The fragile separation between the two sides collapsed when the
few police officers guarding the fence fled when the British fans
began charging.
   ``We attacked the Italians because we were provoked. They not
only abused us verbally, but threw stones at us and hit us,''
testified Liverpool fan Timothy Williams.
   He said it was then that the Liverpool fans charged the Italians.
   Two Belgian police officers also are on trial for not reacting
properly to the incidents that led to the fatal stampede, which
caused a stand holding the fans to collapse.
   ``The stadium was also in poor condition,'' Wilson said.
   The trial, which is in its fourth week, is expected to run
through December.

   Rain and a little snow blew across the Northwest on Tuesday, and
rain was spread over a wide area of the East. Clouds covered much of
the nation.
   A cold front spread showers and gusty wind across the Northwest
and a gale warning was posted along the coast.
   Parts of Washington state got snow showers, and snow continued
through the day at higher elevations of the Cascade Range.
   Early in the morning, Spokane, Wash., got its first measurable
snow of the season, accumulating to as much as an inch.
   In the East, showers developed along and ahead of a cold front.
Showers were scattered from southern Louisiana to east-central
Georgia, and from northern Virginia to New York state.
   A cold front in the central part of the nation created a few
showers in the central Rockies, and more than 6 inches of snow was
possible in the central and northern mountains of Colorado.
   As that cold front moved eastward, showers and thunderstorms were
expected to develop across much of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
during the night and into Wednesday.
   By contrast, Midland, Texas, equaled its record high for the date
of 87 degrees by early afternoon. But afternoon temperatures were
only in the 30s and 40s around the Great Lakes and in the 30s in the
northern Rockies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 28
degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 89 at Harlingen, Texas.
Tuesday morning's official low was 9 degrees above zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
across much of the Great Plains region and Mississippi Valley.
Showers were forecast from the northern and central Pacific Coast to
the northern Rockies. A few rain and snow showers were forecast for
northern Maine.
   High mostly in the 40s were predicted from eastern Washington
state through Montana and Wyoming to Upper Michigan, and across
northern New England; above 70 from southern California through much
of Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast; in the 80s in the desert
Southwest, and from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas through Louisiana
and southern Arkansas to Florida; and in the 50s and 60s in most of
the rest of the nation.

   Egypt deported eight Palestinians for
plotting terrorist attacks against Israel, the official Middle East
News agency said Tuesday.
   An Egyptian court upheld a decision by Zaki Badr, the interior
minister in charge of police, to deport the eight unidentified
Palestinians, the agency said. It did not elaborate.
   The eight were accused of planning ``commando attacks'' inside
Israel and trying to blow up the Israeli consulate in the coastal
city of Alexandria.
   The court said the minister had the legal right to ``take all
measures against unwanted foreigners to guarantee the safety,
security and stability of the country.''
   Interior Ministry officials were not available for comment, and
Palestinian and Israeli sources denied knowledge of the incident.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Tuesday
urged the next U.S. president to be realistic and deal with the
Soviet Union when it is in America's self-interest.
   ``We shouldn't be afraid to do it,'' he said in an election day
speech to young political leaders from around the world.
   He praised the reform efforts of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and said that, if Gorbachev succeeds, ``the Soviet Union
will be a very different place.''
   But later, opening an exhibit of a Soviet photographer, Sergey
Petrov, who is barred from leaving his country, Shultz criticized
emigration restrictions.
   ``We will continue to press hard for Sergey's release as long as
he is held against his will,'' Shultz said.
   Petrov was denied a visa on the grounds he worked in a physics
laboratory years ago. The photographer and his mother also were
refused permission to attend the exhibition of his work at the State
Department.
   ``At least I feel when my works get out part of me gets out
too,'' Petrov said in a letter to a friend that Shultz quoted.
   In his foreign policy speech, Shultz said Gorbachev and his
supporters ``deserve credit for recognizing the problems and trying
to solve them.''
   As a result, he said, ``the environment for democratic values,
peace and freedom is probably healthier than it has been for some
time.''
   Within the Reagan administration, Shultz has played a leading
role in promoting arms-control agreements with Moscow and seeking
other ways to reduce tensions.
   His speech, which had the earmarks of a valedictory, was aimed at
presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and George Bush as well as
foreign leaders. Shultz said everyone should recognize the dangers
of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons proliferation.
   ``When we see an opportunity for problem-solving, when there is
an opportunity to do something that they (the Soviets) want to do
and that we think it is in our interest, in the interest of friends
around the world, we shouldn't be afraid to do it. In other words,
engage,'' Shultz said.
   He said whether Bush or Dukakis won, the United States should be
vigilant in dealing with the Soviet Union. ``We're going to be
realistic but, at the same time, pragmatic,'' Shultz said.
   On a related subject, Shultz said he was confident the Soviets
would complete their withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan despite
an announcement last week that the pullout had been suspended.
   The Soviets last spring committed themselves to remove by Feb. 15
the last of the more than 100,000 troops they have had in that
country.
   Meanwhile, the leader of the Afghan resistance alliance met with
State Department officials. Burhanuddin Rabbani appealed for U.S.
aid for Afghan refugees and to rehabilitate the war-torn country.
   Petrov, 35, first applied to emigrate from the Soviet Union in
1981 and was refused on grounds of state security. His photographs
have been shown in Paris and Washington, but he has never been
permitted to attend.
   In a statement distributed at the exhibit, Petrov said: ``My
problem as an artist and as a professional is that I like challenge
and it doesn't do me any good when I think that I am probably the
best photographer in the Soviet Union.
   ``It doesn't do me any good professionally and I don't want to be
that big fish in a small pond. I`d rather come to the United States
and start from the bottom because then I could see how far I could
go and I would know my real value.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Prosecutor Seeks Extradition of Palestinian</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor on Tuesday called for the
extradition of a Palestinian wanted by the United States for the
1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
   Mohammed Rashid is charged with planting a bomb that exploded
aboard a Pan American World Airways jetliner on a Tokyo-Hawaii
flight. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 other people were
injured.
   Panayiotis Theodoropoulos, president of the five-member Supreme
Court panel, said a decision on the extradition would be issued Nov.
15.
   United States officials have said they view the extradition of
Rashid, 39, as a test of Greece's determination to fight terrorism.
   ``The prosecutor's view is a blow against the Palestinian people
and the Palestine Liberation Organization,'' Rashid told the court.
   He was arrested at Athens Airport on May 29 with a forged Syrian
passport and says he is Mohammed Hamdan, an officer in the military
wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   A PLO diplomat based in Athens told the court his organization
believes that ``the American evidence and charges are false. We know
he is Hamdan, a soldier since 1967 and an officer in our army.''
   Moustafa Batik, a second secretary at the PLO mission in Athens,
said, ``I don't believe he had anything to do with the bombing.''
   Defense lawyers argued the Greek Constitution forbids the
extradition of foreigners ``prosecuted for their actions as freedom
fighters.''
   But on Oct. 10, a lower court approved the extradition and said
sending Rashid to the United States was not unconstitutional.
   A Supreme Court decision to extradite the Palestinian would have
to be approved by Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas before it
can be carried out.
   Police believe Rashid may also be linked to the attack on the
City of Poros cruise ship July 11 that killed nine people and
injured 98.
   American officials claim Rashid also was involved in the 1986
bombing of a TWA jetliner over southern Greece that killed four
Americans. The TWA blast is not mentioned in the extradition request.

   Workers in two shipyards went on strike
Tuesday in support of the doomed Lenin Shipyard, and they defied an
appeal by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to go back to work.
   Walesa, meanwhile, said he might begin talks with the government
even without receiving a guarantee by the authorities for the
continued operation of the yard _ the birthplace of the banned trade
union.
   Several hundred impatient young workers began strikes Tuesday
morning at the Wisla and Repair shipyards in Gdansk to protest the
scheduled Dec. 1 closing of the Lenin Shipyard.
   Strikers said they had waited long enough for the authorities to
start talks promised to consider the banned union's future.
   ``This is a warning to the authorities that we want the
government to set about talks right away,'' said Jan Stanecki,
strike leader at the 1,000-worker Wisla yard, which makes yachts and
small craft.
   Stanecki said 400-500 workers at the yard supported the strike.
As evening fell, some strikers huddled over fires at the gates
roasting sausages and half a dozen police vans drove up to seal off
the shipyard. Temperatures were around freezing.
   About 150 strikers at the 4,500-worker Repair Shipyard also vowed
to stay off the job ``to the end,'' they said.
   Through emissaries, Walesa urged the strikers to end the
protests. He said there was time to solve the Lenin Shipyard problem
and that strikes could hinder resolution of the more pressing issues
of the talks with the authorities and Solidarity's future.
   Walesa spoke with management of the Lenin yard Tuesday and was
told that its liquidation could take two years or more. The
information has convinced him not to demand an immediate reversal of
the decision, he said.
   ``At first we had one month. Now we have two years,'' he said.
``We will fight for it (the shipyard) and we will save it. But the
blade is not at our throats. ... We have time and we can talk about
the shipyard later.''
   But Walesa said that for the climate for talks with the
government to improve, officials must make good on promises to
reinstate about 100 coal miners in southern Poland fired for
striking in August.
   Walesa said he would not allow interference in the composition of
Solidarity's delegation to the talks.
   The government proposed the talks during the August strikes,
Poland's worst wave of labor unrest in seven years.
   Walesa agreed to end the strikes after the government promised
that Solidarity's future could be on the agenda for discussion, as
well as broader issues of political and economic reform.
   Government objections to longtime Solidarity advisers Adam
Michnik and Jacek Kuron as part of the Solidarity delegation have
stalled the talks, and the union views the government decision to
close the Lenin yard as a provocation. The government says the
shipyard is being closed because it was losing money.
   At a rally at the Lenin Shipyard, Walesa said he would like to
start talks with authorities immediately. At a later news
conference, he said strikes would not be advantageous now, and he
indicated that he could lose control of the situation if strikes
spread.
   ``I don't want to go on strike. I want to solve the problems of
the round table and of the Solidarity trade union, not to get the
country into deeper crisis,'' he said.
   Walesa appeared annoyed that the strikes had started and said he
might resign if workers did not follow his decisions.
   ``Perhaps if strikes spread ... I will be ready to resign,'' he
said. ``If they don't follow my decisions, it means I am losing my
control.''
   Walesa sent Jacek Merkel, one of the senior Solidarity leaders in
Gdansk, to the Repair Shipyard to persuade workers to end their
protest action. Later, workers at the gate said the decision to
strike was their own and they planned to continue.
   ``We will stay to the end. We waited two months and that was
enough to get the round-table talks started. We can't wait any
longer,'' said one worker, who did not want to give his name.
   ``The strikes in August were not finished ... We believe other
enterprises and other regions will join us. If we don't win now, the
next generation of young people will do it,'' said Stanecki, at the
Wisla yard.
   In Warsaw, government spokesman Jerzy Urban repeated statements
that the decision to close the Lenin Shipyard was ``final and
irreversible.'' He said workers would benefit in the long-run from
more efficient use of state resources.
   However, Urban praised Walesa for not following through on a
threat to declare a nationwide ``strike alert'' Tuesday.
   Urban, at a news conference, said Walesa's forebearance showed
``reason and realism. ... We are learning democracy.''

   Eight advocates for the homeless on Tuesday
ended 48-day, water-only fasts staged as a protest over funding cuts
in government housing programs.
   Carol Fennelly, a moving force behind the capital city's
Community for Creative Non-Violence shelter for the homeless, was
the first to break the fast, at 9 a.m. EST with a meal of pea soup,
apple juice and sourdough bread sent by well-wishers from San
Francisco.
   She then checked into Howard University Hospital, where she was
listed in critical condition after undergoing a series of tests that
revealed a dangerously low blood potassium level. Her condition was
later upgraded to serious.
   Hospital spokesman Norman Brooks said Fennelly, 39, would likely
survive.
   ``She looked weak, but she was conscious,'' Brooks said.
   ``She is not in great shape,'' said Mitch Snyder, founder of the
shelter. ``Her veins are completely shot and she has no blood
pressure,''
   Three hours after Fennelly ate her first meal since September,
seven other activists, including Snyder, ended similar fasts. Snyder
said the protest was staged to get Congress to restore the 75
percent of the nation's housing budget that has been cut over the
past seven years and, in general, to draw attention to the plight of
the homeless.
   ``We did what we believe is right,'' Snyder said. ``We aren't
concerned about the impact ... we just hope something will happen.''
   Snyder, whose life story was told in a network television movie,
has fasted numerous times to protest the conditions that homeless
people endure. Fennelly, Snyder's longtime companion, lost more than
40 pounds during the fast, which was designed to end on Election Day.
   A week ago, Snyder conceded that the group's fasting tactics
might seem a bit crazy to some. ``Yeah, it's nuts that some people
have to do this in order to get housing for people and shelter for
people,'' he said.

   A delegation of Estonians headed to Moscow on
Tuesday to complain about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
constitutional reforms, Baltic activists said.
   Representatives of the People's Front in the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia complain the reforms are a step
backward in their drive for greater autonomy.
   ``Historians, representatives of the People's Front, all the
people, say it's worse than the Stalin constitution of 1934,'' Felix
Undusk, an editor for state-run Estonian television and official of
the People's Front said in a telephone interview from Tallinn, the
Estonian capital.
   He said two members of the Estonian People's Front left for
Moscow on Tuesday evening along with Communist Party and government
officials to attend a Wednesday meeting on the topic at the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.
   The Presidium is the Soviet Union's collective presidency, and
Gorbachev is its chairman.
   Undusk said he understood that representatives of five other
republics were called to the meeting, but that could not be
confirmed.
   In Riga, Latvia, a spokesman for that republic's People's Front
said representatives from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia gathered for
a one-day meeting Tuesday to determine their response to the
proposed constitutional changes.
   The Latvia organization has come out strongly against them.
   Latvian spokesman Janis Dinevich said the results of the meeting
at the headquarters of the Latvian creative unions would not be
known before Wednesday morning.
   The constitutional reforms create a new national legislature and
a powerful presidency _ changes Gorbachev proposed in June to the
Communist Party conference in Moscow.
   But the Estonian and Latvian People's Fronts have condemned the
plan, saying it removes their constitutional right to secede from
the Soviet Union, and shifts control of the economy and other
aspects of the republic's life to the central government.
   The People's Front organizations that sprang up in the Baltics
earlier this year have been striving for just the opposite: greater
local control and autonomy from Moscow. Some members privately say
their eventual goal is independence from Moscow.
   Top Soviet officials generally have praised the People's Front as
a healthy outgrowth of Gorbachev's effort to restructure Soviet
society and encouragement of greater openness.
   But Gorbachev's top Politburo adviser, Alexander N. Yakovlev, was
quoted in an interview late last month as saying Moscow would not
permit them to take any major steps toward independence.
   The traditionally Westward-looking Baltic states were independent
after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution until 1940, when Soviet tanks
rolled in on the basis of a secret agreement between the Soviet
Union and Nazi Germany that carved Eastern Europe into spheres of
influence.

<HEAD>College Stuck With 94,000 Cookbooks And Printing Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small women's college launched a
cookbook project a year ago with hopes of bringing in $1 million but
is now stuck with 94,000 copies of the book and a $400,000 bill from
the printers.
   The cookbook, compiled by officials of Our Lady of the Elms
College in this Connecticut River city, included more than 400
recipes, many contributed by local and state politicians.
   The Roman Catholic school had planned to use the money raised for
student financial aid and to bring some attention to the 750-student
college, founded in 1928 by the Sisters of St. Joseph.
   College officials ordered 100,000 copies printed. But since last
fall they have sold only 6,000 copies at $10 a copy.
   Sister Mary Dooley, college president, was attending board
meetings of the Association for Independent Colleges and
Universities and could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Sister
Mary Lou Lacey, director of public relations, said no other college
officials would have any comment on the cookbook.
   Earlier, Sister Dooley told New England Monthly magazine that
``we probably did make a mistake in over-ordering.'' She then
provided the magazine with the telephone number at the college at
which orders could be placed. ``They're very attractive,'' she said
of the cookbooks.
   Thomas D. Murphy Jr., chairman of the board of trustees, who
earlier had said a special committee has been established to
``examine all possibilities _ including going outside the state and
country'' to market the book, declined further comment Tuesday.
   The Chicopee attorney said that he and other trustees have been
instructed by their lawyer not to comment on the affair.
   ``It is a very, very sensitive issue for the college,'' he said,
adding that lawyers for the college and the printer were attempting
to resolve the matter of the bill ``and I would hate to say anything
that would thwart those efforts.''
   Earl Alpert, an attorney for the printer, Michael J. O'Malley, a
former trustee of the college, said that his client took the job on
credit and is now looking for his $400,000. He has received
``nothing of consequence'' from the college on the bill, Alpert said.
   Alpert said college officials initially wanted to order more
copies, and O'Malley ``talked them down to 100,000.''

<TEXT>
   The new director of the state's police
training program that has been blamed for the death of a cadet vowed
Tuesday to have a proposal for totally revamped training ready by
month's end.
   ``I have attended a number of police funerals, and never have I
felt the depth of feeling as in that church and outside,'' Peter W.
Agnes Jr. said after the services Monday for cadet Timothy Shepard,
25. ``As the bishop (Joseph Maguire of Springfield) said in his
eloquent message, we can't miss the opportunity to use this
tragedy.''
   ``We have a great need to demonstrate to the public quickly and
in a most decisive way possible that the training programs will be
made safe and the best they can be,'' Agnes said in a telephone
interview from his Boston office.
   Agnes, assistant secretary of public safety, took over the
Criminal Justice Training Council following the resignation last
week of director Gary Egan. Shepard of Pittsfield died the same day.
   He had lingered for 44 days and undergone a liver transplant
after collapsing with heat stroke on the first day of training at
the state's Agawam police training academy.
   State Attorney General James Shannon has sought an inquest into
Shepard's death to determine whether criminal charges should be
brought against State Police instructors. He blamed the rigorous day
of stress training, including punishment laps and pushups, and
inadequate water, for the hospitalization of Shepard and 15 other
cadets out of the class of 50.
   After he was named, Agnes outlawed the use of physical activity
as punishment and asked for the resignation of Agawam director Earl
Harrington. When Harrington declined to quit, Agnes transferred him
and began dismissal proceedings.
   ``We will not teach someone to cope with stress by putting them
under stress. We will do it by giving them the skills and
reinforcement they need,'' Agnes said Tuesday.
   ``We want the people who graduate and become police officers to
continue a lifelong regimen of physical fitness. We don't want them
to think of pushups and situps as some part of hazing or a hellish
experience.''
   Hundreds of Pittsfield residents, unable to squeeze inside the
church, silently lined the street outside during Shepard's funeral
Monday. Many said they did not know the young man, but were outraged
by his death.
   Agnes said Tuesday that he planned to have an outline for the new
curriculum ready for the council's Nov. 30 meeting. It could be
launched as a pilot program beginning in January.
   ``It would be a terrible mistake to put this on hold and study it
for a year,'' Agnes said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scope of a key federal anti-racketeering
law was at issue Tuesday when the Supreme Court was urged to revive
a lawsuit by Minnesota customers against Northwestern Bell Telephone
Co.
   ``This case involved bribery over five years,'' lawyer Mark
Reinhardt of St. Paul contended.
   He told the justices that a federal lawsuit under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, should not be
blocked just because a public utility, rather than the Mafia,
allegedly paid the bribes.
   But John D. French of Minneapolis, a lawyer for Northwestern
Bell, said RICO is aimed at thwarting organized crime and should not
be used against otherwise legitimate businesses accused of fraud.
   The law, as interpreted by the nation's highest court in a 1985
decision, provides a broad right to file private lawsuits.
   Today, it is not unusual to find at least one RICO claim in
lawsuits involving virtually any business dispute. Such businesses
as American Express Co., E.F. Hutton & Co. and Lloyd's of London
have been accused of racketeering in lawsuits invoking RICO.
   And the stigma attached to being linked in public court documents
to alleged racketeering has proved to be powerful leverage for
out-of-court settlements.
   Winners of RICO lawsuits may collect triple damages and lawyers'
fees, both of which generally are not available under state
anti-fraud laws.
   The Minnesota phone customers have accused Northwestern Bell of
bribing state public utility officials. They say the company began
in 1980 trying illegally to win rate increases by offering gifts,
employment and other favors to members of the Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission.
   Their suit was thrown out by a federal judge, and the dismissal
was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year.
   The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failed
to allege a ``continuing pattern of racketeering activity'' required
to make a case under RICO.
   ``A single fraudulent effort or scheme is insufficient'' ground
for a suit, the appeals court said, adding that the dismissed
lawsuit ``alleges no more than a series of fraudulent acts committed
in furtherance of a single scheme.''
   French urged the justices to uphold the 8th Circuit court's
ruling, stating that the allegations against Northwestern Bell
involve ``no threat of organized crime infiltrating legitimate
business.''
   Noting that the state's attorney general is investigating past
rate proceedings involving the phone company and other legal action,
French said exposing Northwestern Bell to RICO liability is not
needed.
   Reinhardt, however, argued that legitimate businesses that engage
in fraudulent acts ``forfeit the right to call themselves
legitimate.''
   He also challenged French's contention that reviving the
Minnesota lawsuit will add dramatically to the growing number of
RICO lawsuits being filed. Reinhardt said RICO lawsuits represent 85
of the 23,000 new federal lawsuits filed each month.
   ``There's been no opening of the floodgates,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration, in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted last May, sided with the phone customers in urging the
justices to interpret the law broadly and reinstate the lawsuit.
   The court's decision is expected by July.
   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov underwent
cardiovascular tests Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital to
determine if he needs to be given a pacemaker before he returns to
the Soviet Union.
   A spokesman for the 67-year-old physicist and Nobel laureate,
making his first visit to the West, said there was no immediate word
on the results of the tests.
   Sakharov has kept up a taxing schedule since arriving Sunday and
appears to be in generally good health. But he has chronic angina,
or chest pain, and is believed to have suffered a minor stroke three
years ago when Soviet authorities force fed him during a hunger
strike.
   If doctors determine that he needs a pacemaker to regulate his
heartbeat, he will return to Boston for surgery later this month,
after visiting Washington and New York, and may extend his stay in
the United States by a few days, said Matthew Bannister, Sakharov's
spokesman.
   Implantation of a pacemaker usually requires a two-day hospital
stay.
   Sakharov's son-in-law, Efrem Yankelevich, said last week that
pacemakers are not generally available in the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov's wife, physician Yelena Bonner, said in a June 1985
letter to relatives in the United States that he had suffered an
``arterial spasm or a stroke and lost consciousness'' when
authorities held his nose and forced liquid down his throat in an
attempt to end a hunger strike.
   Sakharov reportedly had gone without food for several weeks to
protest the Soviet government's refusal to allow Bonner to travel
abroad for medical treatment. The authorities relented and allowed
her to travel to Boston for heart bypass surgery in January 1986.
   Joshua Rubenstein, a specialist on Soviet dissidents for Amnesty
International, said Sakharov also was weakened by a prior hunger
strike in 1981. That 18-day fast led the Soviets to allow his
stepson's fiancee, Liza Alekseyeva, to come to the United States to
marry the stepson, Alexei Semyonov.
   ``But it wasn't just the hunger strikes themselves that caused
the damage,'' Rubenstein said. ``It was the psychological pressure,
the isolation, being force fed, the stroke. Being force fed is a
form of torture, after all.''
   Sakharov, himself, has said little about his heart ailment. Asked
at a news conference Monday about his health, he said only that ``it
hasn't changed either way'' recently.
   Sakharov spent almost seven years in internal exile in the
industrial city of Gorky, which is closed to foreigners. He was
banished there in January 1980 for his outspoken opposition to
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and was called back to Moscow by
Mikhail Gorbachev in December 1986.
   Sakharov's living conditions in Gorky were difficult and he
frequently had to carry around a 30-pound bag with his possessions,
according to Rubenstein.
   Sakharov is scheduled to travel to New York on Friday for a
luncheon sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists. He is to go
to Washington on Saturday for a board meeting of the International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he
is a director.

   Oil well equipment pulled from an Ashland Oil
Inc. field and found to be coated with low-level radioactive silt
will be stored until some agency establishes guidelines for its
disposal, company officials said.
   The muddy silt on equipment recovered from the Martha oil field
contains small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive minerals,
including uranium, and does not pose a health hazard, Ashland
officials said.
   However, workers at the field since August have worn dosimeters
to measure exposure to radiation.
   Company officials said no attempt has been made to keep the
problem a secret, although as of last week the company had not told
Martha residents about the radiation.
   ``We've been very above-board with what we've found,'' said Roger
Schrum, an Ashland spokesman.
   Edsel Moore, director of the state division for radiation and
product safety, said reports indicated low-level radioactivity that
would pose no danger to area residents or people driving past the
storage site.
   There are no state or federal regulations regarding naturally
occurring radioactive materials on in oil-well equipment.
   The radioactive silt was discovered by Ashland Exploration Inc.,
a subsidiary of Ashland Oil, while plugging 1,432 oil wells that
have polluted ground water in Martha, a small community in Lawrence
County in eastern Kentucky.
   The contaminated pipes and other drilling equipment are being
stored on Ashland land, about a half-mile from a state highway.
   No signs indicate the presence of radioactive material, but
Ashland officials say access to the property is controlled by a
clearly marked private bridge across Blaine Creek.
   State officials said they have no reason not to take Ashland's
word for the radiation levels. Inspectors have been instructed to
``go down sometime, the next time we're in the area, so we can say
we've been there, for our own edification,'' said Don Hughes,
manager of the radiation control branch of the state Cabinet for
Human Resources.
   L. Max Scott, a Louisiana State University nuclear scientist
hired by Ashland Exploration, told workers that if they were to lie
on the contaminated pipes 10 hours a day for 200 days they would
receive a dose of radiation equal to one dental X-ray.
   Scott told the company to stockpile the material until the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission publishes guidelines for disposing of
it.
   NRC officials have said it may take two years to produce such
guidelines.
   The radiation problem was discovered a year ago.

   FERE-EN-TARDENOIS, France (AP) _ The leaders of two Cambodian
rebel factions and the Cambodian premier agreed Tuesday to establish
a ``working commission'' to pursue peace efforts.
   Participating in the two-day meeting at this village 70 miles
east of Paris were Vietnamese-backed Premier Hun Sen and resistance
leaders Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann of the anti-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Their talks ended Tuesday.
   They said the new commission will be based in the former
Cambodian Embassy building in Paris and would include three to six
representatives from each group.
   The radical communist Khmer Rouge, which has the largest
guerrrilla force in Cambodia, did not participate in the talks but
the three said it would be invited to send representatives to the
commission.
   The Khmer Rouge had been invited to join in the talks here, but
the three other leaders rejected the organization's proposed envoy
saying he was not ``qualified'' for a summit meeting. The Khmer
Rouge had said it would send Ok Saukun, a delegate to the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
   In a joint statement the three men said they supported calling an
international conference on Cambodia and were prepared to meet again
in France next year.
   No date was set for that meeting but Sihanouk's son, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, told reporters it would not be before September.
   Ranariddh said some means had to be found to include the Khmer
Rouge in the negotitiations on Cambodia's future despite its brutal
rule from 1975-l979.
   ``We shouldn't drive the Khmer Rouge into the forest,'' Ranariddh
said. ``To exclude the Khmer Rouge would be to pass from a war
against Vietnamese occupation to a civil war.''
   The Khmer Rouge came to power in the spring of 1975, defeating
the U.S.-backed government. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
perished as the Khmer Rouge purged opponents and forced millions of
people from the cities in an effort to establish an agrarian
communist society.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge
and established another communist government. The Khmer Rouge,
Sihanouk and Son Sann formed an uneasy alliance to battle more than
100,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.
   Hun Sen, speaking at a news conference, said Cambodians must be
vigilant against a Khmer Rouge return to power ``or else they will
be the instrument of future massacres.''
   ``The Khmer Rouge must put down their arms in exchange for a
political role,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's national security adviser,
paraphrasing one of Vice President George Bush's campaign phrases,
said Tuesday it is uncertain whether Mikhail Gorbachev's reform
policies will ``lead to a kinder, gentler Soviet Union.''
   In a speech prepared for delivery to the American Stock Exchange
Conference on U.S. Perspectives, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell said the
United States may applaud the Soviet leader's appraisal of his
country's problems but ``must nevertheless reserve judgment on both
his economic goals and how he intends to achieve them.''
   ``It is the failure of past Soviet policies _ because there was
effective resistance to their aggression _ that led the Soviets to
reassess those policies,'' Powell said.
   ``Will perestroika, to paraphrase words used in our election
campaign, lead to a kinder, gentler Soviet Union?'' he asked. ``What
advice should the U.S. government give its businessmen who wish to
compete in the Soviet Union?''
   ``These are tough questions,'' he said. ``We cannot forget that
our overall relationship continues to be both competitive and
adversarial. This is unlikely to change within our lifetimes.''
   While the Soviet leaders ``are still Leninists, who think very
much in political terms ... it should be possible _ and may even be
desirable _ to improve economic relations,'' Powell said.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``a system of centralized state control
and planning is inconsistent with both vigorous entrepreneurship and
political freedom.''
   ``Even under perestroika, the Soviets have recognized this truth
only partially,'' Powell said.
   ``It is wrong to think that economic relations by themselves will
moderate Soviet foreign policy,'' he added.
   Powell took issue with what he called ``a groundswell of opinion
that says `help Gorbachev _ sell him whatever he needs'.''
   ``The Soviet Union shows no evidence as yet of changing its basic
military force structure, its emphasis on expanding and modernizing
its weapons systems, or its aggressive, illegal program for
acquiring strategic technologies,'' he said.
   ``Until the Soviets can establish convincingly that it has made
significant changes in these areas, it is not in our interest to
change our policy.''
   ``Some officials seem to be suggesting that we might even have an
obligation to help ensure the success of perestroika,'' the national
security adviser said.
   However, he said, it might be decades before the West has firm
evidence that Gorbachev's policies will ``lead to a more open,
peaceful and democratic society.''
   ``Until we do, those whose legitimate business it is to make
profits through international trade will have to recognize national
security guidelines,'' he said.
   Asked whether he believes Gorbachev aims at world domination by
the Soviet Union, Powell said, ``As a personal matter, I don't think
he does that. I thin he is fully committed to a political philosophy
that has that as its original and continuing goal, but I think it's
a goal that he knows is not achievable.''
   He said one of his major recommendations to the new
administration will be to seek more economic and security aid funds
for countries of Central and South America and for African
countries, principally below the Sahara.
   ``I am going to list it in my transition notes as a number one
item for the next administration to engage the Congress on,'' he
said.
   Asked whether he foresaw resumption of diplomatic relations with
Cuba, he said, ``Not in the near future. Not without significant
change in the nature of the regime.''

<HEAD>Armed Services Claim Safety Record For Aviation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a series of crashes involving
high-performance jet fighters, the armed services enjoyed their
safest aviation year in history in fiscal 1988, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   The Navy, Marine Corps and Army each set individual records for
aviation safety, and the Air Force came close to matching its
all-time best, the Pentagon added.
   Combined, the four services flew their aircraft almost 7.3
million hours during the year ending Sept. 30, experiencing 137
so-called Class A accidents. That amounts to a rate of 1.88 mishaps
per 100,000 flying hours, the standard military measurement.
   A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or
damage exceeding $500,000 to an aircraft.
   The previous record for aviation safety was set by the four
services a year ago, when they reported a combined rate of 2.21 per
100,000 flying hours based on 164 serious mishaps.
   ``The current performance reflects a 35 percent reduction in
major accidents since 1982, with an increase of 4.9 percent in
flying hours, from 6.9 million to 7.27 million hours,'' the Pentagon
said.
   The number of fatalities reported by the Air Force, Marine Corps
and Army declined from a total of 119 in fiscal 1987 to 103 in
fiscal 1988.
   The Navy could not say how many aviators died in fiscal 1988,
said Lt. Janet Mescus.
   The new fiscal year statistics were being ballyhooed at the
Pentagon on Tuesday about the same time that an Air Force B-1B
bomber crashed near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. The crash was the
second involving a production model of that new long-range bomber.
   While the overall news was good, the Navy and Air Force each
reported some problems in fiscal 1988 with one of their jet
fighters. The Navy lost five F-14 Tomcats during the month of
September alone and at least six in all for the year, while the Air
Force lost 23 F-16 Fighting Falcons.
   Service officials said a month ago there was no common thread
among those accidents.
   On a service by service base, the Pentagon said the Army set a
new record safety rate of 1.84 serious mishaps per 100,000 flying
hours in fiscal 1988. The Navy's new record was 2.08 per 100,000
flight hours, and the Marine Corps' new record was 3.18 per 100,000
flying hours.
   The Air Force experienced 1.63 serious mishaps per 100,000 flying
hours, slightly worse that its all-time best of 1.53 set in fiscal
1986.
   Setting aside the statistical rates, the Army experienced 32
serious aviation accidents in fiscal 1988 compared with 38 in fiscal
1987; the Navy, 37 compared with 49 the year before; the Marine
Corps, 14 compared with 20, and the Air Force, 54 compared with 57.
   The Army said there were 39 fatalities in its crashes, compared
with 42 in fiscal 1987. Forty-eight individuals died in Air Force
accidents in fiscal 1988 compared with 57 in fiscal 1987, and 16
died in Marine Corps accidents compared with 20 the year before.
   The Army aircraft experiencing the worst accident rate was the
Vietnam-era UH-1 Huey transport helicopter. The Army said 10 of
those choppers crashed in fiscal 1988 compared with nine in fiscal
1987.
   The Pentagon, in a prepared statement, said the military services
managed to lower their accident rates ``despite increasing
operational demands on aviators, forcing them to fly ... faster,
lower and often in conditions of limited visibility.''
   It attributed the gains to the number of modern aircraft entering
the inventory and to the fact that those aircraft, ``more so than
their predecessors, have been engineered for safety'' from a very
early point in the design cycle.

   Eleven-year-old Stormie Jones, the world's only
survivor of a heart-liver transplant operation, underwent surgery
Tuesday to repair a blockage in a bile duct, hospital officials said.
   Doctors at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh said the five-hour
operation went well. Stormie's liver function will continue to be
monitored, and she will be watched closely for any signs of
post-surgical problems, they said.
   The child in 1984 became the first person in the world to undergo
a simultaneous heart-liver transplant. The landmark procedure was
performed at Children's Hospital by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who
performed Tuesday's operation.
   Two other people had the operation but neither survived.

<HEAD>Anti-Gun Control Groups Question Study On Handgun Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA BLANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-gun control groups and some U.S. law
enforcement officials are questioning the validity of a study that
says the Canadian city of Vancouver is safer than Seattle because of
gun control laws.
   A study to be published Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine concludes that the number of handgun deaths in Vancouver,
British Columbia, 120 miles to the north, between 1980 and 1986 was
nearly one-fifth that of Seattle.
   Dr. John Henry Sloan, chief investigator for the study, said 388
homicides occurred in Seattle during the study period, while 204
occurred in Vancouver. The number of gun-related deaths in Seattle
was 139, compared with 25 for Vancouver, he said.
   Sloan, 34, a researcher at the Injury Prevention Research Center
at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, stopped short Tuesday of
saying his findings prove Seattle's laxer handgun control laws cause
more deaths, but said ``it virtually explains it.''
   Gun control activists were quick to seize the opportunity.
   ``I think that the study clearly puts to rest the notion strong
handgun control laws don't have an effect on levels of crime,'' said
Susan Whitmore, spokeswoman for Washington, D.C.,-based Handgun
Control Inc.
   John Hosford, executive director of the Seattle-based Citizen's
Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, dismissed the study
as a political ploy to help a gun control initiative on Maryland's
ballot.
   ``It's not new research,'' Hosford said. ``I don't think the
study is valid, since it doesn't take into account the cause and
effect of many issues.''
   And Dr. Paul Blackman, spokesman for the National Rifle
Association in Washington, D.C., criticized the study for not
looking at the period before Vancouver's new gun control laws went
into effect in 1978.
   Sloan said Vancouver's laws were made stricter in 1978, but
didn't change significantly.
   In Seattle, handguns may legally be purchased for self defense.
After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a
handgun as a concealed weapon. Recreational uses are minimally
restricted.
   In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a legal reason to
purchase a handgun. Concealed weapons are not permitted and
recreational use of handguns such as target shooting and collecting
are regulated by the province. The weapons may only be fired at a
licensed shooting club.
   In addition, criminal offenses carry stricter penalties than in
the United States, said Vancouver police Sgt. Robert Law.
   Hosford said that what Seattle needs is not more gun control
laws, but stricter penalties for people convicted of crimes
involving guns.
   Jim Deschane, commander of the Seattle police West Precinct, said
he believes the process of allowing people to carry handguns in the
city is ``far too lax'' because police can't check applicants'
medical records.
   Dr. Stanley Abrams, a forensic psychologist who has been involved
in investigations of serial murders in Portland, Ore., said easy
availablity of guns can cause more deaths, because it is
psychologically more difficult for someone to use a knife to kill
than to just shoot a gun.
   ``People who use knives have to be more destructive _ it's
definitely more difficult to kill with a knife,'' Abrams said.
   And since only 5 percent of murders are planned, a person
carrying a gun makes it that much more likely a murder will occur,
Abrams said.

chairman's visit to Israel and his talks with Israeli leaders.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Palestine National
Council will declare an independent Palestinian state in
Israeli-occupied land this month but delay announcing a provisional
government, a council official said Tuesday.
   ``The PNC will ... determine the proper time for announcing the
provisional government and forming it,'' said Salim Zaanoun, deputy
speaker of the 450-member council, which acts as a legislature for
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   It is to convene Saturday in Algiers to determine a new political
strategy following King Hussein's July 31 decision to cut Jordan's
administrative ties with the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   There have been reports for weeks that the PNC would declare an
independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, where an uprising
against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million
Palestinian residents. Israel captured the territories from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   Israel has said it will not accept an independent Palestinian
state, and gains by rightist parties in last week's Israeli
elections have hardened positions.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli leaders told Foreign Minister Giulio
Andreotti of Italy the PLO cannot be a party to peace talks until it
recognizes Israel's right to exist. Andreotti arrived Tuesday for a
24-hour visit in his capacity as chairman for November of the U.N.
Security Council.
   Andreotti told reporters he decided on the visit after PLO chief
Yasser Arafat asked him at a meeting last month to explore the
possibilities of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
   Khaled Hassan, head of the Palestinian council's foreign
relations committee, was quoted by the London-based newsletter
Mideast Mirror as saying the Palestinian state would co-exist with
Israel and a confederation with Jordan is envisaged.
   The Mirror said Bassam Abu Sharif, a close aide to Arafat, told
it the declaration of a state would be issued Nov. 15 and would mark
``national independence day'' for Palestinians.
   Zaanoun said the proposed Palestinian state ``will be ready to
adopt a positive stand ... and exert all possible efforts to reach a
peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli struggle'' at an international
peace conference.
   Asked about international recognition for such a state, Zaanoun
said: ``Declaring an independent country does not need recognition,
but declaring a provisional government does, and the Palestinian
leadership will take this into consideration.''
   He said contacts by the Palestinian leadership show ``the
majority of the world countries support the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state.''

   The Justice Department on Tuesday moved to
strip U.S. citizenship from an Illinois man for concealing his
alleged service as an armed SS guard at a Nazi concentration camp in
World War II.
   The department instituted denaturalization proceedings against
Michael Schmidt, 65, of Lincolnwood in U.S. District Court in
Chicago.
   The department's complaint said Schmidt hid from U.S. immigration
authorities when he came to this country in 1952 his membership
during the war in the SS Death's Head Battalion. It said he hid the
activities from authorities again in 1968 when he applied for U.S.
citizenship.
   Schmidt served at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in
Oranienberg, Germany, the scene of executions and grotesque
pseudo-medical experiments on Jews, Slavs and political prisoners,
Neal Sher, director of the department's Office of Special
Investigations, said in a statement.
   Thirty Nazis have been stripped of U.S. citizenship as a result
of investigations by the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit.

<HEAD>Rushdie Wins Literary Prize for Book Moslems Denounced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie's novel ``Satanic Verses,'' banned
as blasphemous in India and some Arab countries, won the Whitbread
literary prize Tuesday.
   ``We knew about the controversy but we didn't take any notice of
it and we judged the novel on literary merit only,'' said John
Hitchin, one of three judges.
   Hitchin, novelist Fay Weldon and literary editor Nicholas
Shakespeare of the London Daily Telegraph chose the novel from a
list of 80 for the prize, which carries an award of $2,650.
   The novel is named for verses the prophet Mohammed removed from
the Koran, the holy book of Islam, on grounds they were inspired by
Satan.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay and has won prizes for earlier
novels, including ``Midnight's Children'' in 1981.
   He said Tuesday he had received death threats from Moslems when
``Satanic Verses'' was published in September.
   ``I hope the prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, is
listening,'' Rushdie said. ``I'm still optimistic that the ban will
be lifted and every bit helps. This prize certainly will.''
   Hitchin, manager of a bookstore chain, said in a telephone
interview: ``There have been protests in our shops by Moslems. We
have had threats of boycotts, picketing and arson.''
   He described the novel as ``remarkable and totally exceptional,
with wonderful passages about Asian communities in London. There's
nothing blasphemous in it against any religion.''
   Ms. Weldon, who announced the winner in a ceremony at
Whitbread's, a brewing company, called the novel an ``extraordinary
outburst of literary energy.''
   It is about the conflict of good and evil, represented by two
Indian survivors from an airliner blown up by terrorists. The
survivors take on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.

   Famed celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin
Mitchelson says a State Bar investigation of his conduct is ``a
witch hunt.''
   The bar is investigating complaints that he files frivolous legal
appeals and mishandles his clients' money.
   ``There is no question this is a witch hunt,'' Mitchelson said
Monday as he emerged from a two-hour mandatory conference with two
bar prosecutors and a referee.
   Mitchelson, 60, gained fame with his landmark ``palimony''
lawsuit on behalf of Michelle Triola Marvin, who sued her former
live-in boyfriend actor Lee Marvin in 1976.
   Mitchelson has since represented many celebrities and the wives
and girlfriends of actors and sports stars. He represented Joan
Collins in her divorce earlier this year from Peter Holm, and he
counseled Carrie Leigh, former playmate to Playboy founder Hugh
Hefner.
   The bar, which said it had more than 20 complaints about
Mitchelson, contends the attorney failed to deposit clients' funds
in trust accounts; charged ``unconscionable'' fees; failed to
perform promised work; lied to a client; and twice improperly asked
a client to withdraw her complaint to the bar over the return of
unearned fees.
   Mitchelson was represented at the meeting by Arthur Margolis, who
said Mitchelson will face a disciplinary hearing, probably in
January, since the allegations were not resolved at the conference.

   Death-penalty foes sang and prayed
Tuesday for convicted killer Jeffrey Joseph Daugherty and his
victims, one day after the prisoner was executed in Florida's
electric chair.
   Meanwhile, the Florida Supreme Court issued stays of execution
Tuesday after hearing appeals by two other death-row inmates
scheduled to die Thursday morning.
   The court granted an indefinite stay for John Marek, who was
sentenced to die for the June 1983 rape and strangulation of Adella
M. Simmons in Broward County.
   The justices also granted a temporary stay, effective through
noon Monday, to Leo Alexander Jones, who was sentenced to die for
the sniper shooting of Jacksonville police Officer Thomas J.
Szafranski in May 1981. Jones' death warrant is effective through
next Wednesday, and he could be executed if the Supreme Court or a
federal court doesn't extend the stay.
   The warrants issued for the two men's executions were originally
good for the period Nov. 9 through Nov. 16, but none of the 19
inmates executed since 1979 has died under their initial warrants.
Six other inmates on Florida's death row are scheduled to be
electrocuted in the next two months.
   About 35 clergy and other anti-capital-punishment activists
gathered in the Capitol rotunda for the protest Tuesday. They
emphasized also that they were praying for Daugherty's four victims,
as well as Daugherty and the other men Florida has executed in the
last decade.
   ``Our intention is not to diminish the gravity of his crimes.
Jeffrey took the lives of four innocent human beings during an
inexcusable crime spree, and was deserving punishment,'' said
Elizabeth Dawson of the Florida Clearinghouse on Criminal Justice.
``Yet Jeffrey did not deserve to die, even at the hands of the
state.''
   Several protesters said Daugherty's execution, originally
scheduled for late last week, was timed deliberately to take place
close to Election Day, and that Gov. Bob Martinez was playing
politics with human life.
   Roberta Christie, a member of the Tallahassee chapter of Amnesty
International, a worldwide human rights group, said the timing of
the execution demonstrates ``that political leaders cynically use
the death penalty to further their careers.''
   An aide to Martinez said legal considerations, not political
factors, played the only part in Martinez's decision to sign
Daugherty's second death warrant last month.
   ``If you wanted to be cold about it and analyze it that way, it
was a terrible day politically because it got buried in the news,''
said Brian Ballard, director of operations for Martinez.
   Daugherty, 33, was electrocuted shortly after 5 p.m. Monday for
the March 1, 1976, murder of Lavonne Patricia Sailer, a 48-year-old
hitchhiker from Minnesota whom Daugherty picked up in Brevard County.
   She was one of four people Daugherty killed during a three-week
crime spree.
   He also was under life sentences for the slayings of Betty
Campbell, 50, in Volusia County; Carmen Abrams, 60, in Flagler
County; and Elizabeth Shanks in Hollidaysburg, Pa.
   Daugherty was the 103 person to be executed in the United States
since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Agree To Begin Exchanging Sick, Wounded POWs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq joined Iran Tuesday in offering to begin
immediately the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners captured
during their 8-year-old war.
   But the foreign ministers of both countries made it clear after
another meeting with U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson that there was no
progress in efforts to consolidate the truce that took effect Aug.
20.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after the
4{-hour meeting that the two sides discussed how to proceed with
implementation of the U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   He said discussions were continuing but indicated Iraq opposes a
four-point compromise proposed last month by U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Negotiations are stalled over border disputes.
   Perez de Cuellar's proposal seeks to gain a breakthrough by
linking a military disengagement and the exchange of prisoners to
Iranian assurances to cease searching ships for war-related cargo
for Iran and the dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab estuary. The
Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only waterway to the Persian Gulf.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said after the joint
session that ``the main problem is that Iraq has not accepted the
four-point plan of the secretary-general.''
   He said that Iran, independent of the negotiations and on the
basis of an agreement with the International Committee of the Red
Cross, was ready to begin returning sick and wounded Iraqi prisoners
``tomorrow.''
   Aziz, speaking to reporters after a meeting with ICRC officials,
said the repatriation could begin with the 411 sick and wounded
Iranians held by Iraq and registered by the ICRC and 1,115
registered Iraqis held by Iran.
   ICRC spokeswoman Francoise Derron confirmed those numbers of
prisoners had been registered by the Red Cross but said ``since we
have not been able to visit all POWs we may assume there are more''
ill and injured prisoners.
   The ICRC has registered a total of 50,182 Iraqi prisoners in Iran
and 19,284 Iranians in Iraq. It has estimated that an additional
20,000-30,000 unregistered prisoners are held by each side.
   On Oct. 21 Iran said it would be willing to immediately
repatriate sick and and injured POWs ``on a reciprocal basis.''
Tuesday was the first time Iraq said publicly that it would do the
same.
   Ms. Derron said the ICRC would not make a statement on the
possible repatriation of POWs ``until an agreement is concrete. We
are not going to comment in the middle of negotiations.''
   Aziz said the repatriations should be started by each side at the
same time ``in accordance with a proportion to be agreed upon.''
   He said the repatriation should not be used by Iran ``as a
pretext to block the comprehensive exchange operation in accordance
with the Geneva Convention, as more than 100,000 POWs from both
sides still suffer from captivity.''

   A Supreme Court justice on Tuesday temporarily
excused former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, from obeying federal grand jury subpoenas.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall granted an emergency request by the
Marcoses, who are seeking to stay out of jail on contempt-of-court
charges.
   Marshall did not say how long his order would remain in effect.
But the justice said he was referring the issue to the full Supreme
Court.
   The justices are scheduled to hold a private conference Thursday
and likely will review the Marcoses' emergency request then.
   ``We thank God for this development,'' Marcos said in a statement
released by his spokesman, Gemmo Trinidad.
   ``We firmly believe that the American system of justice can be
depended upon to stand for every citizen's rights under American law
and international law, which include the precedence rooted firmly in
the character and tradition of the American people,'' Marcos said.
   Marshall's action means the Marcoses, who have been living in
Hawaii since leaving the Philippines in 1986, may not be jailed or
fined for contempt, at least until the full Supreme Court acts on
the couple's request.
   Marcos and his wife had been ordered by the subpoenas to provide
financial records to the grand jury and to provide fingerprints,
palm prints and handwriting and voice samples.
   A federal judge in New York ruled on Aug. 11 they must honor the
subpoenas and no longer have immunity as ruler and first lady of a
foreign country. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
judge's ruling on Oct. 19.
   The Marcoses were indicted by the New York federal grand jury on
charges of racketeering and that they plundered $103 million from
the Philippine treasury, funneled it to foreign bank accounts and
used it to buy prime New York City real state and art.

   George Bush won Kentucky's nine electoral
votes Tuesday, continuing the state's Republican habits in
presidential elections despite the Democrats' 2-1 edge in
registration.
   With 47 percent of precincts reporting, Bush had 353,706 votes or
57 percent and Michael Dukakis had 262,536 votes or 43 percent.
   The Massachusetts governor was hurt by his liberal image in
Kentucky, especially on the issues of gun control and crime, while
Bush benefited from President Reagan's popularity.
   Kentucky has gone Republican in five of the last seven
presidential elections.
   The only statewide contest to generate interest was a proposal to
lift the constitutional ban on a lottery.
   All four Democrats and three Republicans in the state's House
delegation appeared headed for re-election.

<HEAD>Say Soviet Moves May Have More Political Than Military Significance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's deployment of new
weapons in Afghanistan and the delay of its troop withdrawal may
have more political than military significance, Western diplomatic
sources said Tuesday.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets appeared to be pressing for a political solution of the war
while trying to boost the morale of beleaguered Afghan communists
with a ``wonder weapon.''
   Soviet forces on Nov. 1 rolled two SS-1 Scud-B missiles on their
massive launchers through the streets of Kabul, the Afghan capital.
It was the first time they had been seen there.
   Rebel and Western sources had reported a few days earlier the
deployment of new Soviet MiG-27 fighter-bombers in western
Afghanistan.
   Last Friday the Soviet first deputy foreign minister, Alexander
Bessmertnykh, said in Moscow that his country had suspended its
military withdrawal because of the ``current political situation in
Afghanistan.''
   But neither he nor other Kremlin officials backed off the Soviet
commitment to complete the withdrawal by Feb. 15.
   The Soviet Union agreed under a U.N.-mediated accord in April to
remove its more than 100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan between
May 15, 1988, and Feb. 15, 1989. U.N. observers said the Soviets met
their promise to withdraw half of the force by Aug. 15 but that no
major units have left since then.
   ``The Soviet announcement ... was not a surprise,'' said one
diplomatic source in Islamabad.
   ``There has been no evidence on the ground for preparation of
further withdrawal for nearly three months now. The announcement
probably has more political than military significance.''
   Another diplomatic source said the remaining Soviet troops could
be evacuated in a matter of weeks.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help the Marxist government battle anti-communist rebels.
   About nine Scud missiles reportedly have been fired in
Afghanistan since Nov. 1 but there have been no reports of major
damage.
   The Western sources said the missiles, with a range of 100-175
miles, are not suited for guerrilla warfare.
   One source said the Scud ``was designed as a nuclear delivery
vehicle ... (and) is not a precision weapon. The purpose of Scud
seems to be to bolster the morale of the regime with a wonder
weapon.''
   Afghanistan's official news media said the Afghan army acquired
the missiles and new jet fighters to counter increases in U.S. and
Pakistani arms deliveries to the rebels.
   Western diplomats said the latest developments reflect a
worsening political and military situation for the Afghan government.
   One said he saw the developments ``more as a political maneuver,
designed to foster a political settlement, than as a prelude to a
Soviet decision not to withdraw from Afghanistan.''

<HEAD>Police Arrest Ex-Wife, Housekeepers in Paul's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police said Tuesday they have
arrested the ex-wife, maid and gardener of Jean-Claude Paul, the
former army colonel who died over the weekend after eating a bowl of
soup.
   Col. Georges Valcin, the Port-au-Prince police chief, said the
three suspects would be held for questioning until the circumstances
of Paul's death were clarified. No charges had been lodged as of
late Tuesday.
   Paul, a 29-year army veteran who until his forced retirement in
September was one of Haiti's most powerful commanders, died Sunday
at his surburban Fermathe home. Paul had been under indictment in
the United States on drug charges.
   Initial reports said Paul, 49, died of a heart attack, but a
family friend speculated he was poisoned.
   Radio Metropole, an independent station, reported Tuesday that
the leftover soup was sent to a Miami laboratory for analysis. It
did not say which laboratory.
   Paul's brother, Antonio, an auto mechanic, said in an interview
Tuesday with independent Radio Metropole that his brother died one
hour after eating a bowl of soup for lunch.
   He did not speculate on the cause of death, but said Paul
appeared in good health before the meal. Afterwards, Paul complained
that ``since I drank that soup my body feels stiff,'' Antonio Paul
said. He said his brother went to bed and had severe convulsions
before dying in his arms.
   Radio stations reported Tuesday that Mireille Delinois, twice
divorced from Paul and mother of his 13-year-old son, was arrested
along with an unidentified maid and gardener at Paul's residence. It
was believed the couple, who had divorced, were living together at
the time of Paul's death.
   Ms. Delinois initially was under police protection for fear of
reprisals from Paul's relatives, but was arrested Monday, Radio
Metropole said.
   In March, a federal grand jury in Miami indicted Paul on three
charges of conspiring to import 220 pounds of cocaine into the
United States. Ms. Delinois and Antonio Paul were named in the same
indictment.
   Federal authorities had sought to put Paul on trial, but the
United States and Haiti have no extradition treaty.
   An autopsy on Paul's body was performed Monday at a state-run
morgue. Valcin, the capital's police chief, said Tuesday that the
results would be made public within 48 hours.
   A government official said Paul's funeral was tentatively set for
Thursday.
   Haiti's new military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, fired Paul
on Sept. 30 in a purge of repressive commanders who served under Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Avril replaced Namphy as president in a Sept. 17 coup that was
led by rank-and-file officers demanding democratic reforms and an
end to state-sponsored violence.
   Paul was commander of the Dessalines Barracks, the most powerful
and brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, and was linked to the
Tonton Macoutes, the dreaded private police of the 29-year Duvalier
dictatorship.

   Charles S. Robb, a former governor and
son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson, defeated a longshot GOP
opponent Tuesday to become Virginia's first Democrat elected to the
Senate since 1966.
   Republican George Bush overwhelmed Democrat Michael Dukakis for
the state's 12 electoral votes.
   With 14 percent of the precincts counted, Bush had 166,202 votes
or 58 percent and Dukakis had 118,962 votes or 42 percent.
   With 14 percent of the precincts counted, Robb had 203,493 votes
or 73 percent, and Republican Maurice Dawkins had 76,874 votes or 27
percent.
   Robb and Dawkins, a retired black minister and Washington
lobbyist, competed for the seat of Republican Paul S. Trible Jr.,
who passed up a bid for a second Senate term and plans to run for
governor in 1989.
   Robb outspent Dawkins by about 10 to one.
   Also on the ballot was a pari-mutuel referendum. Virginia voters
narrowly defeated horse-track wagering 10 years ago, but a lottery
referendum passed easily last year.
   Five Democrats and five Republicans were expected to win
re-election to the U.S. House.

   Israel's Supreme Court criticized the army
Tuesday for overcrowding at its main prison for Palestinian
activists but rejected claims that detainees were being held in
violation of international law.
   In the Arab village of Taibe in northern Israel, residents
angered by the demolition of 15 houses built without permits threw
firebombs and stones at police who fired tear gas, the Itim news
agency said.
   It was the first serious riot by Israeli Arabs since January
protests in solidarity with the 11-month uprising of their
Palestinian brethren in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the occupied territories, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 12
Palestinians, including a 16-year-old who was in serious condition
with a plastic bullet in the head, Arab hospital officials said. The
army confirmed seven wounded in clashes, but did not provide details.
   Underground Palestinian leaders called for a general strike in
the occupied lands Wednesday to mark the beginning of the 12th month
of the uprising. At least 309 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been
killed since the uprising began last Dec. 8.
   The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by 14 Palestinians from the
occupied territories held at the Ketziot tent prison in Israel's
southern Negev Desert.
   The detainees had argued they were being held illegally because
Geneva conventions on human rights bar the transfer of prisoners
across borders.
   About 1,700 prisoners are at Ketziot, including 1,558 detained
for up to six months without trial in administrative detention.
   The United States has criticized administrative detention as a
violation of due process.
   In a 45-page ruling, Chief Justice Meir Shamgar singled out
administrative detentions, noting 28 percent of administrative
detentions have been overturned on appeal.
   ``Negating freedom without the approval of a judicial authority
is ... a drastic and serious step which the law allows only where
there are essential ... security concerns,'' he wrote.
   Shamgar also appeared to criticize Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
for scrapping a requirement in January that administrative detainees
be seen by a judge within 96 hours of their arrest.
   Detainees have the right to appeal detention orders, but urged
the army to ensure that appeals are heard within three weeks of
arrest.
   Shamgar, who toured the Ketziot in August, wrote that complaints
about overcrowding were justified.
   The justices found 28 men into a tent at Ketziot where inmates
were forced to sleep pushed against each other with no room for
personal belongings.
   The court decision was expected to have little impact because the
army said the number of prisoners has been sharply reduced in recent
weeks.
   In Taibe, Arabs threw firebombs and stones at hundreds of police
who responded with tear gas. Two police officers and an Arab were
injured and 13 people were detained, Israel radio reported.
   Taibe residents went on strike Tuesday to protest Monday's house
demolitions.
   In the West Bank shantytown of Jiftlic, the army bulldozed about
a dozen shacks of Palestinian migrant workers in retaliation for a
stabbing attack in which an Israeli soldier was killed by an Arab
laborer Monday, the army said. About 100 people were left homeless,
Arab reports said.
   Jiftlic is about 25 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   In Haifa, police detained a 27-year-old American Jewish woman who
tried to smuggle weapons into the country, Israel radio reported. It
described the woman as a U.S. citizen who had an apartment in
Jerusalem.
   The woman, whose name was not released, was detained on Monday
after tax authorities found two Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault
rifles, a pistol and ammunition in her luggage, it said.
   The woman claimed she needed the weapons for self-defense, the
radio said.

   A B-1 bomber, the Air Force's most advanced
strategic aircraft, crashed Tuesday and all four crew members
ejected safely, one man getting out seconds before impact, officials
said.
   The crash was the third since the B-1 began flying three years
ago as the nation's first new long-range bomber in more than 25
years.
   The crew members ``were taken to the Dyess hospital and are in
good condition,'' said Air Force spokesman Linda Gellnere of Dyess
Air Force Base, where the long-range bomber was based. The plane
crashed about 3:30 p.m., about eight miles northwest of here.
   Lou Paulsen of Abilene, who witnessed the crash, said the plane
appeared to be making a normal flight away from the base when smoke
starting coming out a left engine as the craft was circling.
   ``At first there was just a puff of smoke, then fire,'' said
Paulsen, who was about two miles away. ``It looked like it started
to go out, then it flared up big.''
   Paulsen, who is an Air Force reserve member, said the pilot
apparently abandoned hope of returning to Dyess and decided to ditch
the plane in an unpopulated area.
   ``It banked back toward the left, then they started ejecting,''
said Paulsen, who was watching with his wife. ``Three chutes came
out, right after another. Then the plane started veering left into
the country.
   ``The last parachute came out seconds before the plane crashed in
a ravine in an unpopulated area,'' he said.
   When it hit, the plane exploded in a fireball 10 stories high.
White smoke could be seen for more than 20 miles, filling the sky
west of Abilene, witnesses said.
   The crew's dramatic escape was captured by a television film crew.
   ``We looked out our window to the west and we saw a B-1 aircraft
with flames coming out of the back,'' said Joyce Heiser of KTAB-TV
in Abilene. ``We followed it with a camera. It headed off to the
north and the east.''
   The plane went down a couple of miles north of Interstate 20 in
an open field. Emergency and rescue vehicles were at the scene less
than half an hour after the crash.
   The base was the first in the country to get the B-1 and is still
the flight training center.
   The B-1, built by the Rockwell International Corp., is the first
new long-range bomber to be produced by the United States in more
than 25 years.
   The Air Force ordered 100 of the planes at a total cost of $27
billion, but lost one in an accident on Sept. 28, 1987, at a
training range in Colorado when the bomber ran into a migrating
pelican. Three aviators were killed in that accident.
   Before that accident, a prototype of the new plane _ designated a
B-1B _ crashed in August 1984 at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif,
killing one person and injuring two.
   The four-engine, swing-wing bomber is designed to fill the gap
between the aging B-52 and the B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber in the Air
Force arsenal.
   The plane has a maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of
more than 7,000 miles. It is smaller than the B-52 but capable of
carrying more bombs, and already holds a number of world aviation
speed records for a plane of its size.
   The B-1B is designated as ``a low-altitude penetrator,'' meaning
it is expected to fly at almost the speed of sound at altitudes of
only 200 feet above the ground. During a nuclear war, the B-1B would
be the bomber expected to actually fly missions inside the Soviet
Union.
   The Air Force has been criticized over the past two years for its
handling of the B-1B program, primarily because of acknowledged
problems in developing the bomber's radar-jamming gear. However, the
service insists the plane is still the best long-range bomber in the
world.

   A 230-pound weightlifter diagnosed as a

150-pound father to death in a bear hug, police said.
   Joseph Saraceno, 37, apparently clasped John Saraceno, 68,
breaking six ribs and a vertebra, police Lt. Bob Banks said.
   ``It's difficult when you're dealing with the mentally ill,''
said homicide detective Jack Hoffman.
   On Friday, Saraceno stood outside his family's home for 14 hours,
swaying side-to-side in the rain, neighbor Angie Renna said. The son
eventually went into his home.
   His mother discovered the body on Saturday and Saraceno was
arrested.

   Republican Rep. Pat Swindall fought to save his
political career Tuesday as George Bush captured all 12 electoral
votes in Georgia, the state where the Democrats nominated Michael
Dukakis.
   With 13 percent of the precincts counted, Bush had 75,278 votes,
or 56 percent, to Dukakis' 58,133 votes, or 44 percent. Only John
Kennedy in 1960 and native son Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980 have
broken the GOP candidates' string of wins in Georgia since 1960.
   Swindall was expected to lose his 4th Congressional District seat
to Democratic challenger Ben Jones, a recovered alcoholic who played
``Cooter'' in TV's the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' and narrowly lost to
Swindall in 1986.
   This year's race, called one of the nation's nastiest, was marked
by Swindall's references to Jones' drinking and arrest record, and
Swindall's indictment on federal perjury charges stemming from a
grand jury investigation of drug money-laundering. Jones says he
hasn't had a drink since 1977 and that the arrests date to his
drinking days.
   Democrats hold eight of the state's 10 U.S. House seats.

   George Bush won Alabama's nine electoral
votes Tuesday, but Republicans had little hope of making substantial
gains in state and local races.
   With 15 percent of the precincts counted, Bush had 92,837 or 56
percent of the votes, to Dukakis' 73,769 or 44 percent.
   A record 274 GOP nominees were running for office in Alabama, but
state GOP political director Steve French predicted only modest
coattails from the national ticket even in a landslide.
   Alabama went for President Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and Bush was
the lopsided favorite over Democrat Michael Dukakis in a series of
polls over the past two months.
   The makeup of the state's congressional delegation _ five
Democrats and two Republicans _ was not expected to change. The
closest race was in the 1st District between Republican Rep. Sonny
Callahan and Democratic challenger John Tyson.

   A fire started by a welder's torch in an
evidence storage room at the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice
forced authorities to evacuate the building Tuesday and transfer
1,800 jail inmates.
   No one was seriously injured, but 30 firefighters and six
sheriff's employees were treated at hospitals for smoke inhalation,
said Fire Department spokesman Dean Kathey.
   Sheriff Sherman Block said narcotics, particularly cocaine,
burned in the 45-minute blaze. Authorities will conduct an inventory
of the evidence to determine how much was lost, he said.
   The blaze began in a seventh-floor storage room that contained
documents and narcotics seized as evidence in sheriff's department
investigations, said Vince Marzo, a city fire department spokesman.
   Greg Acevedo, a fire dispatcher, said officials were concerned
that runoff water from the storage room might be contaminated by the
narcotics evidence.
   Heavy, black smoke poured from the building, in the Civic Center
district of government and public buildings.
   An estimated 1,800 county prisoners were housed in the upper six
floors of the 13-story building, which is more than 60 years old,
county officials said.
   The inmates were transferred to the county's main jail, the Men's
Central Jail, a few blocks away, Sheriff Sherman Block said at an
impromptu news conference.
   The sheriff said there was no automatic sprinkler system in the
building, although he noted that fire hoses were installed on each
floor.
   The building was originally the county's main justice building,
holding jail, courts and law enforcement offices. Now, courts are in
other buildings and the hall is used primarily as headquarters of
the sheriff's department and a jail for short-term prisoners.
   The building shares a busy intersection with City Hall, the
Criminal Justice building and the U.S. District Courthouse.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis won the District of Columbia's
three electoral votes Tuesday with a wide margin over Republican
George Bush.
   With 100 percent of the precincts counted, Dukakis had 75,494
votes or 84 percent and Bush had 14,564 or 16 percent.
   The Democratic candidate had piled up big majorities among the
overwhelmingly black voting population in each of the last five
presidential elections since residents gained the right to vote in
national contests in 1961.
   For example, Walter Mondale received 85 percent of the vote in
1984, while he was trounced nationally by President Reagan.
   Walter Fauntroy, the city's non-voting delegate to Congress,
appeared on the way to easily retain his seat. The Democrat, a black
minister and veteran of the civil rights movement, had only token
opposition to his bid for a 10th term.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts Denounce Animal Killings But Do Not Ban Them</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National Boy Scout officials concede the
slaughter of chickens and rabbits during a wilderness survival
weekend should not have happened, but say the organization will not
ban the practice.
   The disclosure that scouts were shown how to kill chickens and
rabbits and then butcher them for eating raised the ire of
animal-rights activists who wanted the Scouts to prohibit such
training.
   The killing techniques were demonstrated during a camping trip
held Sept. 30 through Oct. 2 in Perry County, Afterward, five to 10
scouts tried it themselves, beating the animals on the head with
sticks, slitting their throats and hanging the carcasses upside down
to drain.
   ``We agree with you completely that the incident involving the
rabbits and chickens should not have happened,'' national Boy Scout
spokesman Frank Hebb wrote last week to Edward J. Blotzer Jr., of
the Pittsburgh office of the Humane Society.
   ``For 78 years as a part of our training, we have demonstrated
the sixth point of the Scout law: a scout is kind. He does not hurt
or kill harmless things without reason, and we hear about it when
there are isolated violations,'' Hebb wrote.
   G. John Giba, who did not attend the camp but is scoutmaster for
one of the troops involved, said the killings were done properly and
without malice.
   But George Cave, president of Trans-Species Unlimited, a
state-wide animal-rights group, said the killings were unnecessary,
cruel and not good training for young boys.
   ``We object to desensitizing children to the killing of animals
for no good purpose,'' he said.
   Hebb said in a telephone interview Monday that the Boy Scouts
will not change current policy or discipline the Scout leaders who
led the exercises.
   ``We do not endorse what they did, but I don't think that there's
going to be any action because I think that what they did at the
time was perfectly legitimate within our policies,'' he said.
   Cave said he was disappointed with the Boy Scout leadership's
lack of action on the issue.
   ``Naturally we're very disappointed in this decision, or the lack
of one,'' Cave said.

<HEAD>Dole Says Quayle Fine But Bush Could Have Found More Able Person</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said Tuesday
night he hasn't changed his opinion that George Bush could have
found a more qualified running mate, but he also said Dan Quayle
would be a good vice president.
   After the Bush-Quayle ticket was sealed at the Republican
National Convention last summer, Dole said of the Indiana senator:
``You could find better qualified people.''
   In an interview on CBS Tuesday night, Dole said, ``I didn't say
anything critical of Dan Quayle. He's an outstanding young man. But,
let's face it, if you're looking for the ablest person, I assume
that George Bush could have found others.''
   ``But Dan Quayle has done a good job. He's going to be a good
vice president,'' he added.
   Dole, R-Kan., had been on Bush's short list of possible running
mates after his own bid for the GOP presidential nomination failed.
   On another subject, the Senate Republican leader said on NBC
Tuesday night that the deficit and long-term health care will be at
the top of Congress' agenda next year.
   He said Bush's promise not to raise taxes may be difficult to
keep if that means ruling out all revenue sources.
   ``My view is that we don't have to touch tax rates on individuals
or corporations. But when you rule out everything _ user fees,
excise taxes, any kind of a tax that might even support a program _
that's going to be difficult to do.''
   ``But George Bush has said, `No new taxes.' I'll be willing to
help him in that effort, and we'll see what the Democrats have to
say,'' Dole said.

   In a likely Republican sweep, Sen. John

for a second term, and George Bush was leading in the race for
Missouri's 11 electoral votes.
   With 25 percent of the votes counted, Danforth won a third term
with 98,568 votes or 54 percent and state Sen. Jay Nixon had 84,348
votes or 46 percent.
   Recent polls showed Republican Ashcroft enjoying as much as a
35-point lead over challenger Betty Hearnes, wife of a former
governor.
   Democrats who held five of nine U.S. House seats _ including
one-time presidential candidate Richard Gephardt _ were expected to
win re-election.
   Republican Rep. Bill Emerson faced a tough rematch with
Democratic farm activist Wayne Cryts in southeast Missouri's 8th
District.
   Missourians also were asked to decide the fate of the so-called
MedAssist proposal, a $296 million tax increase to finance a

   Evan Bayh became the first Democrat in 20
years to win the Indiana governorship, but Sen. Daniel Quayle's home
state voted solidly for Republican George Bush in the presidential
race Tuesday.
   Two-term Republican Sen. Richard Lugar also was re-elected.
   Bayh, the 32-year-old son of former Sen. Birch Bayh, defeated
two-term Republican Lt. Gov. John Mutz. With 60 percent of the
precincts reporting, Bayh had 622,148 votes, or 53 percent, and Mutz
had 533,771 votes, or 47 percent.
   Lugar had 768,557 votes, or 67 percent, and Democrat Jack Wickes

   In the presidential race, Bush had 704,724 votes, or 59 percent,
to Dukakis' 484,294 votes, or 41 percent. The victory gave Bush 12
electoral votes.
   Indiana voters also repealed the state's 137-year-old
constitutional ban on lotteries.
   GOP Gov. Robert D. Orr was barred from seeking a third term.
   In House races, Indiana Democrats tried to protect their 6-4

   With 31 percent of the precincts reporting, Martin had 304,056,

   Martin, 52, is a former college chemistry professor and six-term

who served four terms in the state Senate.
   In the hottest congressional race, Rep. Howard Coble, a
Republican from Greensboro, faced a stiff challenge by former state
legislator Tom Gilmore, a Democrat. Coble won a second term in 1986
by 79 votes in one of the nation's most volatile districts. The

   Evan Bayh, the 32-year-old son of a former U.S. senator, was
elected Indiana's first Democratic governor in 20 years and the
youngest governor in the nation Tuesday, while a newcomer ousted
West Virginia's GOP warhorse, Gov. Arch Moore.
   Democrats also fought to oust Republican governors in Rhode
Island and Utah, while Montana offered the GOP its best hope of
retaking the office there as voters in 12 states filled their top
office.
   With 71 percent of the vote counted, Bayh, who as the son of
former Sen. Birch E. Bayh is heir to a popular name in Indiana
politics, defeated Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, 761,768 votes
or 53 percent to 672,003 votes or 47 percent.
   In West Virginia, Gaston Caperton, a wealthy insurance executive
seeking his first political office, denied the 65-year-old Moore an
unprecedented fourth term in a state with a slumping economy.
Caperton, 48, styled himself an outsider with a businessman's
approach to the job and portrayed Moore as an old-school politician.
   With 48 percent of the vote counted, Caperton led 157,940 votes
or 60 percent to 103,621 votes or 40 percent for Moore.
   In scoring the Democrats' first victory in an Indiana
gubernatorial race since 1964, Bayh overcame a GOP landslide for
George Bush and Sen. Richard Lugar in vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle's home state.
   Bayh, Indiana secretary of state, succeeds Robert D. Orr, who at
70 is the nation's second oldest governor. The youngest U.S.
governor in office is John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, who was not up
for re-election Tuesday. He is 40.
   Democrats held 27 of the 50 governorships and hoped for a net
gain Tuesday of two to four seats, which would put the party in good
position to influence the state congressional redistricting battles
after the 1990 census.
   Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and three Democrats _ were on
the ballot. Orr is barred by law from a third term; Montana Democrat
Ted Schwinden and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are retiring.
   In Rhode Island, businessman Bruce Sundlun began his second
effort to unseat Gov. Edward DiPrete as a distant underdog, but
turned the race into a cliffhanger by pressing allegations of
unethical conduct against the incumbent. Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter,
stigmatized by a big tax increase, battled back and reached Election
Day in a tight race against Democrat Ted Wilson, former mayor of
Salt Lake City. Independent Merrill Cook, who ran on a
tax-limitation platform, battled for the support of conservatives.
   Montana's Thomas Judge, Democratic governor in 1973-81, battled
former GOP state Sen. Stan Stephens over how best to revive the
state's farm and railroad economy.
   In other races:
   DELAWARE _ Republican Gov. Michael N. Castle trounced Democrat
Jacob Kreshtool, a retired labor lawyer and political newcomer. With
86 percent of the vote, Castle had 139,044 votes or 71 percent, to
Kreshtool's 57,173 votes or 29 percent.
   MISSOURI _ Republican John Ashcroft was re-elected by a
landslide. With 45 percent of the vote in, Ashcroft received 339,721
votes or 61 percent to 217,958 votes or 39 percent for Democratic
state Rep. Betty Hearnes, wife of a former governor.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Judd Gregg, a congressman and son of a
former governor, defeated Paul McEachern, a lawyer and fierce
opponent of the Seabrook nuclear plant who nearly rode the issue
into the governor's office two years ago. With 42 percent of the
vote counted, Gregg received 82,508 votes or 62 percent to
McEachern's 50,291 votes or 38 percent.
   NORTH CAROLINA _ Republican Jim Martin was re-elected over Lt.
Gov. Bob Jordan, a Democrat. With 64 of the vote counted, Martin had
700,730 votes or 56 percent to Jordan's 546,273 votes or 44 percent.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Gov. George Sinner expected a landslide victory
over Republican Leon Mallberg, a businessman making his first run
for statewide office.
   VERMONT _ Democrat Madeleine Kunin, the state's first woman
governor, was elected to a third two-year term. With 33 percent of
the vote counted, Kunin received 26,787 votes or 54 percent to
22,423 votes or 45 percent for House GOP Leader Michael Bernhardt.
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic Gov. Booth Gardner expected a landslide
victory over Republican state Rep. Bob Williams.

   The GOP hoped a big Bush-Quayle victory in Quayle's home state
would help pull Mutz through in Indiana, where Bayh was favored by a
margin that had narrowed dramatically in the closing days of the
race. It was Quayle who ousted the elder Bayh from the Senate in
1980.
   Mutz claimed credit for the state's prosperity and argued that
Bayh was too inexperienced and saw the governor's office as ``one
more jewel for his political crown.'' The Democrat argued that Mutz
should be held responsible for the two biggest tax increases in
state history and that he negotiated deals that gave away too many
economic development incentives to foreign companies.
   The coattail effect of the Republican national ticket resulted in
a net loss of five Democratic governorships in 1980 and one in 1984,
said Charles H. Dolan Jr., executive director of the Democratic
Governors' Association.
   In West Virginia, Caperton, an insurance executive who portrayed
the election as a referendum on state's slumping economy, led by
double digits throughout the campaign against Moore, who sought an
unprecedented fourth term in predominantly Democratic West Virginia.
   In Rhode Island, Sundlun, a communications executive who lost to
DiPrete by a landslide in 1986, robbed the governor of an early,
commanding lead in the polls by raising questions about DiPrete's
private business deals, alleged favoritism in the awarding of state
contracts and the hiring of the ex-wife of a reputed mobster for a
state job. DiPrete stressed the state's economic recovery.
   The Bangerter campaign in Utah also counted on a strong showing
by Bush. The governor's comeback from an early, 30-point deficit in
the polls largely coincided with Bush's surge since the Republican
National Convention in August.

   Insurance executive Gaston Caperton
ousted three-term Gov. Arch Moore as Democrats swept West Virginia
on Tuesday.
   Michael Dukakis won the state's six electoral votes and Sen.
Robert Byrd handily won a sixth term.
   With 48 percent of the precincts counted, Byrd, who intends to
step down as Senate majority leader, had 173,807 votes or 68 percent
and freshman GOP state Sen. Jay Wolfe had 82,854 or 32 percent.
   In the governor's race, with 48 percent counted, Caperton had
157,940 votes or 60 percent and Moore had 103,621 votes or 40
percent.
   Dukakis had 147,038 votes or 56 percent with 48 percent counted,
and Bush had 115,40-3 votes or 44 percent.
   Caperton, a Charleston insurance executive seeking his first
political office, spent $2.1 million to win a seven-way primary and
more than $1.7 million against Moore.
   The state faces high unemployment and has had to borrow $80
million to keep operating this year.
   All four of the state's Democratic congressman were returned to
office.

   Bush, who first ran for the White House a decade ago and lost in
the 1980 primaries to Reagan, awaited the nation's verdict in
Houston. He said ``no predictions'' as he voted earlier in the day,
and described and described the election as ``a referendum on a
philosophy, a way of life,'' and then awaited returns with family
members in his hotel suite.
   Dukakis campaigned even as the vote totals mounted. ``It's a
fight to the finish, a cliffhanger,'' he said. ``It reminds me of
1960,'' when John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon battled down to
the finish, Dukakis said before concluding a final round of TV
interviews fed back to the battleground states.
   But as the night wore on, it looked less and less like 1960 _ and
more like four of the five previous White House elections that ended
in Republican victory.
   Bentsen said on ABC that Republicans ``did a job on Michael
Dukakis with the negative ads....And they distorted his record, to a
remarkable degree.'' Bentsen was a cinch to win a new term in the
Senate from Texas no matter which side claimed the White House.
   Quayle wanted the last laugh after being on the receiving end of
endless Democratic jokes and sharp public scrutiny. Dole wasn't the
only Republican who expressed concern that the 41-year-old Indiana
senator was not seasoned enough to be vice president.
   But for all the controversy Quayle provoked, election-place polls
suggested this election held to form, with the running mates swaying
few votes.
   Democrats were renewing majorities in both the House and Senate
that will comprise the 101st Congress. The two parties vied for
gains in 12 gubernatorial contests, races that held significance for
a nationwide redistricting that takes place after the 1990 census.
   Democrats held a 54-46 edge in the old Senate and an overwhelming
255-177 advantage in the old House, with three vacant seats.
   Democratic senators winning re-election included Edward Kennedy
in Massachusetts; Paul Sarbanes in Maryland; James Sasser of
Tennessee; Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York and Don Riegle in
Michigan, Howard Metzenbaum in Ohio, Jeff Bingaman in New Mexico and
Quentin Burdick in North Dakota. Frank Lautenberg fought off a
spirited challenge from Pete Dawkins to hold his New Jersey seat.
   Robert Byrd of West Virginia also won, as did Maine's George
Mitchell _ one of three men who hope to succeed him as Senate
Majority Leader.
   Republican senators re-elected were Richard Lugar in Indiana,
John Danforth of Missouri, John Heinz of Pennsylvania, William Roth
in Delaware and John Chafee in Rhode Island.
   There were tougher races, of course.
   Republicans hoped to spring an upset in Montana against John
Melcher and Democrats targeted Malcoln Wallop in Wyoming.
   Democratic millionaire Herbert Kohl led state Sen. Susan
Engeleiter in early returns in Wisconsin. Rep. Mike Lowry battled
former GOP Sen. Slade Gorton for an open Republican seat in
Washington.
   Political pros on both sides agreed the House would live up to
its reputation as a citadel of security for lawmakers seeking
re-election. Dozens of Democrats and Republicans had either no
opposition or only minor party rivals.
   Democratic Speaker Jim Wright of Texas was among them, even
though he is under investigation by the House ethics committee. GOP
Leader Bob Michel of Illinois faced a rematch against his close 1982
rival, G. Douglas Stephens.
   The most powerful among the endangered incumbents was Rep.
Fernand J. St Germain, a 28-year congressional veteran from Rhode
Island under fire for allegedly accepting gifts and trips from
savings and loan industry officials subject to his committee's
jurisdiction.
   Second-term Republican Pat Swindall, under indictment for
perjury, fell to Ben Jones in a rematch of their 1986 Georgia race.
   Most of the mystery surrounding House races concerned the 27 open
seats, 15 held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats.
   Democrats hoped to improve their current 27-23 numerical
superiority in the statehouses, and Bayh and Caperton got them off
to a fast start.
   Republican Gov. Michael Castle won a new term in Delaware. Ditto
Jim Martin in North Carolina and John Ashcroft in Missouri. Judd
Gregg kept the New Hampshire statehouse in Republican hands.
   Madeleine Kunin kept Vermont safely Democratic.
   Reagan, still popular after eight years in the Oval Office, was a
full participant in the Republican campaign effort, crisscrossing
the country for Bush and the GOP congressional candidates.

   Typhoon Skip killed at least 73 people
and left thousands homeless as it swept across the central
Philippines into the South China Sea, relief agencies said Wednesday.
   The death toll brought to more than 300 the number of people
known to have been killed by three storms that have ravaged the
Philippines in two weeks.
   Late Tuesday Skip was about 260 miles southwest of Manila and was
moving west-northwest at 19 mph, the government weather service said.
   Its peak winds had weakened to 88 mph, compared to 108 mph when
it came ashore Monday in the central island of Samar.
   The storm's center moved across the islands about 100 miles south
of Manila, sparing the capital much damage.
   But the Office of Civil Defense reported seven people drowned in
floods in the Manila suburb of Pasig.
   The Social Services Department reported at least 1 million people
were affected by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property were
destroyed or damaged. The Office of Civil Defense said more than
30,000 people were homeless.
   Red Cross officials said 36 people were killed on Palawan, where
Skip triggered widespread flooding on the southern part of the
remote island.
   The Red Cross said the next hardest-hit area was Camarines Sur
province on the southeastern edge of Luzon island, where 19 people
were killed in landslides and a tornado triggered by the typhoon.
   The other deaths reported were seven drownings on Panay Island, a
person electrocuted by a downed power line, and three drownings on
Marinduque Island and in Agusan del Norte province.
   Casualty reports from Philippine relief agencies often conflict
because of differences in reporting and in standards for accounting
for deaths. The Red Cross reports casualties only if they can
identify the victims by name.
   The overall death toll of 73 included seven in Manila's Pasig
suburb and eight on Panay island which were reported by the
government Office of Civil Defense but not by the Red Cross.
   Typhoon Ruby struck the Philippines on Oct. 24 and Tropical Storm
Tess swept through the Visayas Islands on Saturday.
   Officials said Typhoon Ruby killed at least 181 people on land
and at least 64 others perished and more than 200 are missing from
the passenger ship Dona Marilyn that sank. They said the tropical
storm caused floods that killed 11 people.

   The marauding computer virus unleashed last week
has jolted many academics into realizing that ethical values are
critical in a field where brilliant minds can turn dangerously
arrogant, careless and naive.
   ``I would like to see students more sensitized to this,'' said
Peter Yee, a member of the experimental computing center at the
University of California's Berkeley campus, one of the targets of
the virus. The virus, believed spread by a graduate computer science
student at Cornell University, clogged an estimated 6,000 computers
at universities and research institutes by spreading via electronic
mail networks and making copies of itself.
   Others queried in an informal sampling of top U.S. universities
said they believe most computer science students have a fundamental
grasp of proper ethical conduct. But several said computer advances
are moving so quickly that questions of right and wrong often have
not been discussed in depth.

   Human rights champion Andrei Sakharov warned on his
first trip to the West that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
reforms face a domestic backlash, but dismissed the personal risks
of continuing his outspokenness.
   ``If perestroika does not succeed, then the question of my return
to (exile in) Gorky is totally insignificant,'' Sakharov said
through a translator Monday. Gorbachev released Sakharov from
internal exile nearly two years ago.
   Perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economic and
political system, is ``at a very critical phase,'' the 67-year-old
Nobel Peace Prize winner told reporters during a two-hour news
conference. He said there are ``sharp debates in the press and at
all levels'' over political and economic issues. ``The fate is being
decided of which direction our development will go,'' said Sakharov.

   Only two people received free needles on the
first day of a program for drug addicts that seeks to stem the
spread of AIDS, but an official declared the nation's first
government needle giveaway ``an enormous success.''
   Dr. Stephen Joseph, the city's health commissioner, said he
anticipated a slow start for the experiment, which calls for
participation by 400 of the city's estimated 200,000 drug addicts.
The experiment is an attempt to learn whether giving intravenous
drug users clean needles will limit needle-sharing among addicts.
AIDS can be spread through the use of contaminated needles, and
health officials say drug abusers are a major conveyor of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome to heterosexuals.
   The program has drawn opposition from the city's top police
official and some black and Hispanic leaders, who say giving out
needles encourages drug abuse.

wine-producing states are thinking of organizing. They say they need
a lobbyist. Soybeans, beef, pork and even catfish enjoy special
benefits from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they say, so wine
should, too.
   While the market for premium wines is exploding, vinters outside
California have been without Washington representation to fight for
favorable tax, trade, pesticide and labeling laws, says Richard J.
Feeney, who used to lobby for the meat industry and is now
organizing a trade association for winemakers.
   ``Until now,'' he says in a letter to prospective members of the
National Vintners Association, ``wine has not been looked upon as
agricultural and has not been able to share these benefits. The time
has come for wine to take its place with other agricultural
commodities.''

<HEAD>Vatican Crackdown Claimed Against Progressive Brazilian Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN LEHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite Vatican denials, theologians
here say Pope John Paul II is out to discipline the predominantly
progressive and independent-minded church in the world's largest
Roman Catholic country.
   Jose Queiroz, a theologian and philosopher at Sao Paulo's
Catholic University, said in an interview ``the Holy See has
embarked on an offensive to force the Brazilian church to follow the
conservative positions he favors.''
   On Oct.19, the Vatican officially denied reports, published in
the Brazilian press, of the existence of a so-called ``conservative
offensive'' against Brazilian bishops considered too progressive.
   The pope repeatedly has stressed he wants the church to
concentrate on its traditional role of spiritual salvation. Queiroz
and other theologians say the pope seeks to curb the largely
left-of-center leaders of Brazil's church.
   The pope recently appointed conservative cardinals to head two
key Brazilian archdioceses. He is reported preparing to pull the rug
out from under one of Brazil's most influential clergymen, the
outspoken and highly progressive archbishop of the city of Sao
Paulo, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns.
   Theologians say the Vatican plans to divide Sao Paulo's huge
archdiocese, the largest in the world. This would open the way for
the appointment of new bishops who would toe the pope's dogmatic
line, and it would undermine Cardinal Arns' influence.
   Also irritating the pope is the growth of the activist liberation
theology in Brazil _ a grass-roots theology based on Jesus' concern
for the poor. It promotes greater social, political and economic
awareness among poor people.
   The Vatican has said there is no place in the church for the
political-religious cocktail promoted by some liberation theologians
and has censured Brazil's leading exponents of that approach, the
Rev. Leonardo Boff and Spanish-born Bishop Pedro Casaldaliga.
   A leading spokesman for the progressive wing of the church, the
Most Rev. Tomas Balduino, bishop of the city of Goias, said in a
telephone interview:
   The Vatican is ``determined to restore the centralized and
authoritarian structure of the church _ a structure which does not
tolerate original thought or any divergence from the traditional
doctrine of saving souls.''
   The Most Rev. Luciano Cabral Duarte, archbishop of the
northeastern city of Aracaju and a conservative, says the church in
Brazil was divided ``between those who remain faithful to the
ecclesiastical institution such as Christ created it, and those who
want a more modern church which would work as a democracy.''
   The second option is not valid ``because the church was never
meant to be a democracy'' Duarte said in a signed opinion column in
the influential conservative newspaper, O Estado de S. Paulo. ``The
apostles were not elected by popular vote. The church is a
hierarchy.''
   Queiroz said, ``The conservative forces in the Vatican are slowly
but surely gaining ground.
   ``This became very clear when the pope named Cardinal Lucas
Moreira Neves as archbishop of (the large northeastern city of)
Salvador and Cardinal Jose Freire Falcao as archbishop of Brasilia
(the capital).''
   He also sees in the rumored carving up of the Arns' archdiocese
of Sao Paul a move to curtail the influence of the progressive wing
of the church in Brazil.
   Arns, an ardent defender of liberation theology and human rights,
currently exercises his influence over an area inhabited by some 15
million people.
   ``According to the Vatican's plan, the archdiocese would be cut
to just five districts concentrated in the city's metropolitan
area,'' Queiroz said.
   ``The rest of greater Sao Paulo, inhabited by the kind of
low-income workers pro-liberation theology forces want to reach,
would be divided into four separate dioceses with their bishops
named by the Vatican.''
   Arns has declined comments on the planned division of his
archdiocese.
   The Most Rev. Boaventura Kloppenburg, bishop of the city of Novo
Hamburgo in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul and another
recognized conservative, welcomed the division of Sao Paulo's
archdiocese for the same reasons progressives condemned it.
   In a phone interview, he said the Vatican was concerned with
Brazil's liberation theologians ``who refuse to follow the pope's
guidelines and who adopt positions that are irreconcilable with the
official doctrine.''
   Kloppenburg said it was ``evident'' and ``obvious'' that by
naming new conservative cardinals and by splitting up Cardinal Arn's
archdiocese ``the pope will reassert his authority over Brazil's
church.''
   ``The church's goal is to bring about mankind's spiritual
salvation and not, as liberation theology would have it, create a
social consciousness among the people,'' Kloppenburg said.
   Queiroz says, ``There are reactionary forces inside the Vatican
trying to nullify the church's active participation in the social,
economic and political problems of the country. In this sense they
are trying to restrict and police the actions of the progressive
clergy.''

   Most modern architects don't seem to know
much about what a church should look like, according to leaders of a

   ``We have been troubled in recent years by the number of new

   An official of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops discounts a survey claiming Catholic women have
disproportionately more abortions than Protestant or Jewish women.
   The Rev. John W. Gouldrick, head of the NCCB pro-life offices,
says the survey by the Alan Guttmacher Institute was flawed since it
failed to gauge the degree of church involvement of the women
counted as Catholic.
   He says an investigation into a similar 1981 survey found that
most of the women identified as Catholics actually described
themselves as ``non-practicing'' Catholics or ``ex-Catholics.''
   That survey, like the new one, found that women with no religious
affiliation have the highest abortion rates.

   Many American Jews foresee new efforts to stiffen
definitions of ``who is a Jew'' as a result of the recent Israeli
elections, which have given additional leverage to the country's
religious parties.
   ``We strongly urge the leadership of both major parties ... not
to use the Law of Return as a bargaining chip to form a new
coalition,'' says Robert K. Lifton, president of the American Jewish
Congress.
   Orthodox Jewish parties want the law admitting Jews limited in
regard to converts to those converted under Orthodox requirements,
which are stricter than those for Conservative and Reform Jews.
   Lifton says, ``Any action to change this law would be a grave
error, a betrayal of Jewish unity and would certainly alienate the
American Jewish community.''

   Leveraged buyout funds have been cropping up like
summer corn stalks, but whether there will be a prolonged harvest of
profits for investors is another matter altogether.
   By some estimates, there are over 100 funds in existence, more
than half of which were established in the past five years to cash
in on the latest craze in takeovers.
   Just a few years ago, big leveraged buyouts were a scarce
commodity. In 1981, 15 buyouts were announced worth at least $25
million each for a total of $3.1 billion. By 1987, the figure jumped
to 114 such buyouts totaling $59.1 billion, according to Russell
Reynolds Associates Inc., a New York recruiting firm.
   In the past year alone, among those to announce their intentions
to enter the fray by creating funds that invest in LBOs are
Manufacturers Hanover, Citibank, General Electric Credit Corp., and
Merrill Lynch & Co., which is specializing in a fund for small
investors, among others.
   LBO funds attract investors ranging from well-heeled individuals
to pension funds to university endowments often with the promise of
returns as high as 50 percent. With such strong backing, LBO funds
have been able to amass $25 billion to $30 billion in assets, which
is enough to leverage 10 times that amount.
   But the proliferation of these funds is putting pressure on
managers to turn deals.
   ``There's no question that when you buy an LBO fund, you are
buying because you want those funds to make (takeover) offers and be
part of offers,'' said Hugh Johnson, first vice president at First
Albany Corp.
   ``The returns in many LBO funds have been substantial, so as
result it has driven a lot of expectations of returns for those
funds in future,'' he added.
   Despite the availability of money for financing, most LBO funds
find it challenging to find good deals at appropriate prices, said
Steven B. Potter, a managing director at Russell Reynolds.
   So much money chasing deals is bound to boost the price of
transactions and cut into profit margins. Ultimately there is the
danger that these funds may not be able to rake in the double-digit
returns they advertise.
   Johnson said he believes investors have developed ``expectations
well beyond what is realistically possible.'' That means, as Johnson
notes, that ``maybe not so far down the road, there are going to be
some disappointments.''
   In the case of RJR Nabisco Inc., three potential bidders have
emerged, including two major leveraged buyout firms. The RJR deal
has pretty much carved up Wall Street _ Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
and Salomon Bros. Inc. are working with RJR managers, while LBO
powerhouse Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. has its own entourage of
backers for its $20.7 billion bid.
   Rival buyout firm Forstmann Little & Co. also is considering a
bid, which could push the price tag of the deal even higher.
Analysts already are concerned that any higher offer could make the
deal financially unfeasible.
   In a leveraged buyout, a portion of a company's assets are used
to finance the acquisition. The deal also relies on taking on a
substantial amount of debt, which typically forces managers to sell
off assets and slash overhead to meet their obligations to banks and
bondholders.
   More troubling than RJR is the case of Campeau Corp.'s takeover
of Federated Department Stores Inc. After investors looked askance
at the $1.15 billion in junk bonds needed to finance the deal,
Campeau scurried to restructure the package to make it more
attractive.
   If Campeau or its financial backers lose money on the deal,
Johnson said, financiers will probably take a harder look at LBOs.
Large pension funds and other investors ``will withdraw from those
funds, and then the acquisitions could dry up,'' he said.

<HEAD>Traditionalist Movement Seems Undeterred By Vatican Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICKENBACH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four months after Archbishop
Marcel Lefebvre was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic church,
his traditionalist supporters seem largely undeterred by papal
warnings that they will face the same punishment if they do not
break with him.
   The titular head of Lefebvre's St. Pius X Fraternity of Priests
says a total of 15 priests and 18 seminarians _ less than 10 percent
_ have left the movement since the rebel prelate consecrated four
traditionalist bishops June 30 in defiance of the Vatican.
   Lefebvre and his followers say that the church has embarked on a
course of ``auto-destruction'' since the Second Vatican Council of
1962-65. They reject many reforms introduced then, including the
replacement of Latin with the vernacular in the liturgy and
relations with Protestant churches.
   The archbishop argues that he continues to recognize papal
authority but that the consecrations were a legitimate ``emergency''
act to save the church and that therefore the excommunications were
invalid.
   The defections leave 210 priests in the fraternity and 255
students in the fraternity's six theological schools in Australia,
the United States, France, Switzerland, and West Germany, according
to the Rev. Franz Schmidberger.
   ``Percentage-wise, the number who left us is small but every
defection hurts us, of course,'' Schmidberger, who succeded Lefebvre
as superior general of the fraternity in 1984, said in an interview.
``It hurts particularly at a time when we need more and more priests
to help us in our work.''
   That need is growing, he said, because of a growing attendance at
traditionalist services in the churches, chapels and other places of
worship founded by the fraternity.
   ``We estimate that attendance at holy Mass celebrated in our 530
centers worldwide has increased between 5 to 10 percent since the
consecration,'' Schmidberger said.
   ``In some places, like in St. Louis which I visited during a
recent tour of the United States, the increase is even higher, the
local priest told me.''
   Schmidberger said Lefebvre had expected that attendance would
decline by 25 percent while the Vatican had figured that 80 percent
would renounce links with the archbishop should he defy the pope.
   There is no firm figure on the number of Lefebvre's active
supporters, as they do not register. The Vatican estimates the
number at between 60,000 to 80,000. But two years ago, a
pro-Lefebvre petition addressed to the Vatican was backed by 135,000
signatures. Estimates have put sympathizers in the millions.
   The consecration of the four bishops created the first major
schism in the church in more than a century. It resulted in the
automatic excommunication, or expulsion from the church, of Lefebvre
and the four bishops, and of Monsignor Antonio de Castro Mayer, a
Brazilian prelate who assisted Lefebvre in the ceremony at the Swiss
seminary in Econe, birthplace of the fraternity.
   Pope John Paul II, in an apostolic letter made public two days
later, warned Lefebvre's followers that they, too, will be
excommunicated if they stay with him. At the same time, he promised
the church will permit their traditionalist practices if they remain
loyal to Rome.
   A special eight-member commission was set up by the pope to bring
Lefebvre's priests back into the church. A new ``St. Peter's
Fraternity'' features tradionalist liturgy under the Vatican's
auspices.
   But the inauguration of the fraternity's first seminary in West
Germany has run into problems because of reported disagreements
between the superior, the Rev. Joseph Bissig, and the local
hierarchy. Bissig, former head of a Lefebvre seminary, broke with
the archbishop the day after the consecration.
   ``That fraternity will never get off the ground,'' said
Schmidberger. ``These people sit between all chairs.''
   He voiced confidence that the traditionalist movement will
continue to grow. By the end of the year, he said, all four new
bishops will have ordained 15 new priests, in Switzerland, West
Germany, Argentina and Australia, where a seminary opened only
recently. In 1989, about 40 new ordinations are scheduled and the
level of enrollment at the seminaries is unchanged, he said.
   The fraternity's activities are exclusively funded by private
donations, according to Schmidberger. ``We do not benefit from the
church tax. In fact, our followers, for example in Germany and in
some Swiss cantons, pay twice.'' The church tax is collected by
authorities in some countries on behalf of the church from
registered members of religious community.
   Schmidberger, a German national, is also confident that
eventually the Vatican will seek a new dialogue with his fraternity.
He estimates that at least 10 of the 156 members of the College of
Cardinals secretly sympathize with the traditionalists
   ``But we will not take the initiative,'' he said. ``We are not
under time pressure. And we are in a relatively strong position.''

   Threads of an invisible Jonestown have been
so successfully woven into society's fabric that most people remain
unaware of the proliferation and destructive power of cults in
America.
   ``People think the cult problem died in Jonestown,,'' said
Patricia Ryan, daughter of U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan, who was killed by
Peoples Temple gunmen hours before 912 people swallowed poison at
the cult's jungle compound. ``But problems like this are happening
everyday on a smaller scale. Cults are a huge problem.''
   A decade since the shock and horror of the Jonestown massacre,
myths persist about cults and the people who become trapped in them.
   The two most pervasive misconceptions: that cult members are
glassy-eyed flower peddlers, easily recognizable from everybody
else, and that people who become involved in cults were emotionally
weak or defective to begin with.
   ``People don't realize that destructive cults blend in very well
with society. They don't realize they may be working with someone in
a cult, that they may have relatives in a cult,'' said Cynthia
Kisser, executive of the Chicago-based national Cult Awareness
Network, a clearinghouse for information about that most of the Rev. Jim
Jones'
followers were good people who wanted to do good, said journalist
Tim Reiterman, who spent more than four years investigating the
Peoples Temple before and after the mass death, and who was wounded
in the Port Kaituma airstrip ambush that killed Ryan and four others.
   The Peoples Temple had its share of former drug addicts and
ex-cons; it also attracted college professors, white-collar
professionals and Ivy League lawyers. Between these extremes were
decent, hard-working, middle-class folk who believed in interracial
harmony and helping others.
   ``People still have the tendency to dismiss the people of the
Peoples Temple as a bunch of crazies and kooks and worse. But when
you've spent a whole lot of time with the subject, you understand
they're a whole lot like the rest of us,'' said Reiterman, who wrote
eloquently about Jones and the Temple in his 1982 book with
co-author John Jacobs, ``Raven: The Untold Story of the Rev. Jim
Jones and His People.''
   Afterward, his descriptions of Temple members were met with
amazement. ``People would say, `From the way you're describing these
people, they sound just like regular people.' Well, most of them
were, and but for circumstances or a weak moment in their lives or a
desire to help other people, they would never have ended up with Jim
Jones.''
   For some, the beginning was Indiana in the 1950s, when Peoples
Temple was an interracial ministry with heavy evangelical and
Pentecostal overtones. Eventually, the Temple became less a
religious group than a political one, and always, it was the
handsome, charismatic Jones who inspired his diverse flock.
   ``There was no way to separate (his) warped world from his
idealized vision and his social conscience, nor the real threats
from his paranoia, his benevolence from his cruelty, his genius from
his madness,'' Reiterman and Jacobs wrote.
   A master manipulator, Jones used classic mind-control techniques
on his followers, including isolation, fear and denial of sleep,
protein and privacy. By Nov. 18, 1978, the leader's paranoid belief
that death was the only way to avoid destruction by outside forces
had been adopted by many people far more rational than Jones.
   ``They were drawn to Jim Jones as a father, as a priest, as a
hero, as someone who could complete their lives,'' said California
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier, who also was wounded at Port Kaituma.
``In one way or another, we're all seeking that.''
   The fact that search continues is reflected in the volume of
calls providing or requesting information of the Cult Awareness
Network: 10,000 this year, twice as many as 1987. The kinds of
groups eliciting the most inquiries include satanic, Bible-based,
New Age and self-awareness, Kisser said.
   The network believes destructive cults meet four criteria: the
use of deceptive recruiting; financial exploitation of recruits for
the group or leader's benefit; use of mind control or brainwashing
techniques, and a feeling by members of being trapped.
   The Peoples Temple fulfilled those, as do others now. Public
ignorance and denial of that fact make another Jonestown a real
possibility, Kisser said.
   ``We do have these deaths occurring regularly, but it's one here
and two there,'' she said, citing last month's beating death of
8-year-old Dayna Lorae Broussard, whose father, Eldridge Broussard,
founded the Ecclesia Athletic Association.
   Through Ecclesia, more than 50 children were moved from
inner-city Los Angeles to a house near Portland, Ore., where
authorities said the youngsters were beaten and starved.
   ``For every child who died in Jonestown, many more have died
since in similar circumstances,'' Kisser said. ``Tragedies are being
perpetrated one person at a time.''

   The world's largest newsprint maker, pressured by
weak demand and resistance from American newspapers, says it is
reducing and delayint its latest announced price hike.
   Abitibi-Price Inc. of Toronto said Monday it had told its
customers it decided to increase prices for newspaper customers by
$30 to $680 a metric ton effective Feb. 1.
   Last September, Abitibi announced it was raising its newsprint
prices to $695 a metric ton, a 6.9 percent increase, effective Jan
1. Several other manufacturers, including Bowater Inc., the largest
U.S. producer, followed suit.
   But newspaper officials balked, arguing that the price hikes were
unjustified because of weak demand for newsprint stemming partly
from a drop in advertising.

   Last week's computer virus attack, the biggest
ever, has caught the attention of leaders in business and government
and should lead to improvements in computer security, according to
several consultants.
   Security consultants said Monday they had received far more
inquiries than usual since the end of last week.
   But they said computer security is a wide-ranging matter that
cannot be solved simply by assigning passwords and installing some

   Maurizio Gucci, an heir of the founder of the
Gucci luxury goods company, has been convicted of attempted tax
fraud and given a $750 fine and a one-year suspended sentence.
   Vittorio Ajello, the lawyer for Gucci, said Monday's decision
means Gucci will regain control of shares that will give him half of
the company.
   Gucci was accused of having arranged the falsification of the
signature on the documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by
making it appear that his father, Rodolfo, transferred ownership of
the shares before his death in 1983.

<HEAD>Stocks, Dollar Falls in Advance of Preidential Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Uncertainty about the results of today's presidential election is
keeping the lid on activity in the stock and foreign exchange
markets.
   Stock prices tumbled and the dollar fell in restrained
election-eve dealings on Monday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 21.16 points to close the
day at 2,124.64. In the broader market, four issues fell for every
one that gained in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks.
   Analysts said investors withdrew from the market early on Monday,
neither buying nor selling, to await the outcome of today's vote.
They said while Wall Street felt relatively certain of a victory by
Republican George Bush, investors were cautious after weekend polls
suggested Democrat Michael Dukakis had narrowed the gap in some
areas.
   Those concerns also were cited for a decline in the dollar
against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar.
   The dollar finished lower in European trading and continued to
drift steadily downward as activity shifted to the United States.
Despite the depth of the currency's drop, trading was quiet.
   In the bond market, prices slipped and interest rates rose.
   Rates also finished at the highest levels in more than three
years at the regular weekly Treasury bill auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.54 percent, up from 7.37 percent last
week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.71 percent, up from 7.48 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since May 13, 1985, when three-month
bills sold for 7.69 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.9 percent.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve said in a new economic report
that Americans took out $1.88 billion more in consumer debt than
they paid off in September, the smallest advance in 10 months.
   The September increase in consumer debt was down from an August
rise of $5.32 billion and was the smallest monthly advance since a
$1.79 billion rise in November 1987.
   While much of the decline in September was traced to weak auto
sales, economists said the pattern of the past several months
indicated consumers had grown more cautious in their buying plans.
   From July through September, consumer debt rose at an annual rate
of 6.75 percent, down significantly from a 10.2 percent growth rate
in the first six months of the year.

   Energy futures prices have gained some ground,
with most of the buying interest was focused on unleaded gasoline.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
unleaded gasoline gained 0.91 cent to settle Monday at 47.25 cents a
gallon, after rising 1.14 cents on Friday.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
the December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which fell
0.24 cent on Friday, was up 0.05 cent to 44.13 cents a gallon.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, closed at $14.06 a barrel, up 2 cents. The contract
increased 14 cents on Friday.
   Most traders continued to take a low profile ahead of the next
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting scheduled for
Nov. 21, analysts said. OPEC is likely to discuss cutting production
as a way of increasing sagging worldwide oil prices.

<HEAD>Computer Virus Episode Raises Ethical Questions At Leading Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The marauding computer virus evidently unleashed
last week by a top graduate student has jolted many academics into
the realization that ethical values are becoming critical in a field
where brilliant minds can turn dangerously arrogant, careless and
naive.
   ``I would like to see students more sensitized to this,'' said
Peter Yee, a member of the experimental computing facility at the
University of California's Berkeley campus, one of the targets of
the mass infestation.
   The virus, believed spread by a computer science student at
Cornell University, clogged computers at universities and research
institutes by spreading via electronic mail networks and making
repeated copies of itself.
   ``Before this incident, students felt that security and privacy
were somebody else's problems,'' Yee said Monday. ``Now that one of
our own has done this, I expect more in-depth discussion.''
   Others queried in an informal sampling of top U.S. universities
said they believe most computer-science students have a fundamental
grasp of proper ethical conduct. But several said computer advances
are moving so quickly that questions of right and wrong often have
not been discussed in depth.
   ``Harvard takes very seriously the issues of moral and ethical
behavior, not only in the area of computer science education, but in
all aspects,'' said John Shattuck, vice president for government,
community and public affairs at the prestigious institution.
   ``I think there's a broad consensus among students and faculty at
Harvard that tampering with major computer information systems is a
very bad thing to do, and it can cause disruption within the whole
social structure,'' he said.
   At the same time, Shattuck said, ``I think the technology is
moving so rapidly here that it's somehow gotten ahead of the
discussion and careful weighing of principles, as reflected in the
slow evolution in the law in this area. This case will certainly
draw attention to the questions.''
   Eugene Mallove, spokesman and chief science writer for the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the virus incident
compelled the school's authorities to reiterate their policy on the
misuse of computers, which will be published Wednesday in the campus
newspaper, Tech Talk.
   ``We're going to send out a message loud and clear that this is
not to be tolerated, this is not a matter to be taken lightly,'' he
said.
   The virus incident occurred just a few weeks after MIT held a
symposium on ethics in high-technology fields, titled ``How to Be
Good,'' although the specific question of spreading computer viruses
wasn't discussed, Mallove said.
   James Ball, director of computing facilities at Stanford
University, another key virus victim, said most students and
researchers were awed by the infestation and how easily it spread.
   ``A lot of us have talked about what could have happened. If this
had been a malicious attack, it could have been a real disaster,''
Ball said. ``For us, the reaction was wiping the sweat off our brow
and saying `woooh.'''
   But Ball said that underlying ethical and legal questions about
why spreading such a virus was wrong, or even whether it was wrong,
haven't been discussed much, reflecting an important weakness in the
discipline.
   ``There's a great deal of naivete among computer science people.
They spend an enormous amount of their lives in front of a screen.
Some are somewhat introverted,'' he said. ``Computer scientists, I
don't believe, have the foggiest notions about laws on things such
as copyright infringements.''
   Still, Ball said, ``I think there's a general impression it was
wrong. People were talking about the possibilities of fines and
imprisonment. People realize the severity of the potential outcome
for people who do it, sort of like if I'm speeding and I see a crash
where people burned to death.''

<HEAD>Bottled Draft Beer Reshaping Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co., which revolutionized the
industry with the success of its low-calorie beer, is reshaping the
market again with its hot-selling bottled draft beer.
   And industry observers say packaged draft sales should continue
climbing as companies search for ways to snatch portions of a
stagnant beer market.
   ``They (Miller) know how to experiment, and I think it becomes
more important as the market goes sideways,'' said Robert Weinberg,
a former Anheuser-Busch Inc. executive who now heads a St.
Louis-based brewing industry research firm.
   Miller, owned by Philip Morris Companies Inc., introduced Genuine
Draft in 1986 and sold about 1.4 million barrels that year. Sales
nearly doubled last year, and company officials say there could be
50 percent growth in 1988.
   Sales still are small when compared with the top-selling beers in
the country, such as Budweiser from Anheuser-Busch Inc. and Miller's
Lite beer.
   But the success of Genuine Draft has led Adolph Coors Co. to
revamp its strategy and market its premium and super-premium beers
as draft products.
   ``We think packaged draft could be the emerging growth category
of the 1980s into the 1990s,'' said Ralph Kytan, General Draft brand
manager. By next spring, the company expects to have spent more than
$80 million in equipping its breweries for Genuine Draft production.
   Draft beer, which is not pasteurized, and the concept of selling
it in bottles and cans is not new. Analysts say companies attempted
to sell packaged draft beer in the 1960s and 1970s but they did not
give it the same push as now, largely because the market was growing
and there was less pressure to sell new products.
   Miller, which has been struggling with the decline of its
flagship High Life brand, got the idea to introduce Genuine Draft
after witnessing a surge in packaged draft sales in Japan, Kytan
said.
   ``When you're in a flat industry, obviously you have to be
turning over every stone,'' he said.
   Coors, based in Golden, Colo., long has promoted its
non-pasteurized beer, which company officials say has helped sales.
But the Coors premium line had eroded over the past decade, and the
company recently introduced a second premium brand _ Coors Extra
Gold _ advertised as a bolder-tasting beer.
   Now, both products are being marketed as draft beers in the wake
of Miller's success.
   Michael Marranzino, a brand director at Coors, described the
change more as an evolution rather than a dramatic departure,
``since draft is really a process which we've been using for many
years.''
   Marranzino acknowledged that when Miller introduced its
non-pasteurized beer, officials at Coors hoped their Milwaukee-based
competitor would succeed in hooking the consumer on draft beer.
   ``We had a natural tie-in,'' he said.
   John Collopy, president of the Milwaukee investment firm, Cleary
Gull Reiland McDevitt & Collopy Inc, said Coors has been ``drafting
on Miller's marketing,'' but he also said Coors must get its
products to grow on their own if they are to succeed.
   With competition for market share continuing to tighten, analysts
say Anheuser-Busch, the nation's No. 1 brewer, obviously is watching
the developments at Miller and Coors.
   An Anheuser-Busch spokesman, Mike Fleming, said the company's
policy is not to comment on the competition or whether any new
strategies are planned.
   But Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an
industry newsletter, said he has strong information indicating
Anheuser has investigated the packaged draft market to some degree.
   ``It makes sense,'' he said. ``If you have competition doing well
with something, you check it out.''
   In gaining rapid success with its product, Miller has tapped into
public perceptions that draft beer tastes better, analysts say.
   ``I think most beer drinkers think draft beer is better,'' said
Weinberg. ``There is a magic there.''
   Kytan claims Miller's process of filtering the beer instead of
sterilizing it with heat gives the brew a ``darn close'' taste to
draft beer from a keg.
   But Weinberg says Miller might be capitalizing more on the image
than the product, and contends the average consumer could have a
difficult time telling the difference between packaged draft and
another premium beer.

<HEAD>Analysts Skeptical Of Pillsbury Plan To Spin Off Burger King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say they doubt whether Pillsbury
Co.'s plan to spin off its troubled Burger King subsidiary will
thwart Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5.23 billion hostile takeover bid,
but a judge's ruling may have given the company more time to fight.
   Pillsbury announced Monday morning that it would spin off
Miami-based Burger King as a separate public company owned by
Pillsbury shareholders, under a plan approved by the board of
directors.
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Pillsbury fell
$1.37{ to $59 a share.
   After the market closed, a Delaware judge denied Grand Met's
request Met to block Pillsbury from using its ``poison pill''
takeover defense against the tender offer. Grand Met's takeover bid
was conditioned on the defense being lifted.
   But retired Justice William Duffy sided with Pillsbury in
Delaware Chancery Court. He ruled that the company's directors, 12
of whom are independent of the company, were abiding by their
fiduciary responsibilities in keeping the plan in place.
   Ian Martin, chief of Grand Met's U.S. operations, said his
company has asked Duffy to reconsider his ruling because it did not
take into consideration Pillsbury's plan to spin off Burger King.
   Steve Carnes, a former Pillsbury executive who is an analyst for
Piper Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis, said Monday's events
favored Pillsbury, but the food and restaurant company's battle
against Grand Met was far from over.
   Carnes and other analysts criticized the Burger King plan. They
said it would weaken the already troubled restaurant chain and
amount to a combined $40 value for shareholders, compared with the
$60 in cash Grand Met has offered for each share of Pillsbury common
stock.
   Under the plan, Pillsbury said it would distribute one share of
Burger King common stock for each share of Pillsbury common stock,
payable on Jan. 27 or earlier for shareholders of record on Dec. 2.
   The company also said Burger King would declare special dividends
of cash and securities payable after the spin-off. The size of the
special dividends was not disclosed.
   Pillsbury has the right to cancel the dividends, but the company
said the payout would provide ``immediate value to shareholders
while at the same time allowing Burger King to grow and develop
values in the future.''
   Pillsbury's board also directed management to continue exploring
other alternatives for boosting shareholder values.
   Martin said Pillsbury's plan is ``vague and does not contain
sufficient information to evaluate the separate Pillsbury and Burger
King companies.''
   He also said debt resulting from the plan would weaken both
companies, possibly leading to large-scale layoffs, plant closings
and a reduction in philanthropy.
   Carnes and analyst Malcom Knapp, who heads his own firm in New
York, said the debt the plan would add to an already troubled Burger
King would make a turnaround of the world's second-largest
restaurant chain less likely.
   ``It's a desperate thing,'' Knapp said. ``It doesn't make any
sense.''
   Burger King accounts for about one-third of Pillsbury's sales and
about two-thirds of its profits but has not done well recently. In
the fiscal year ended May 31, the chain's pre-tax profits plunged
more than 50 percent from a year earlier, to $48.2 million.
   The company's stagnant sales have been blamed partly on
inconsistent advertising. Burger King dumped its advertising agency,
J. Walter Thompson, last fall after an association of 11 years.
   Burger King Chairman Jerry W. Levin acknowledged the marketing
problems but praised the new business arrangement at a news
conference in Miami, where the chain is based.
   ``We think it makes us best equipped to create a full turnaround
for Burger King,'' he said.
   Separately, Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith said the company's
remaining operations will be streamlined, with its well-known brands
becoming its principal business. Products included in Pillsbury's
packaged foods unit are Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice
cream, among others.

   Pillsbury Co.'s proposal to spin off its Burger King
fast-food business to shareholders would relieve it of a prized
business that has caused Pillsbury problems with its weakening
earnings.
   Pillsbury announced the planned spinoff on Monday, as part of its
strategy to try to thwart a $5.23 billion hostile buyout bid by
British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Jerry W. Levin, Burger King chairman, told a news conference
Monday that the plan marked a positive change for the chain, which
he said apparently had suffered from marketing problems and
inability to achieve consistency in all its 5,578 outlets.
   ``It is clear we're going to have to change. There should be some
corporate streamlining,'' he said.
   Burger King will be adding departments to replace corporate
services formerly provided by Pillsbury even as it eliminates other
positions to tighten its operation, Levin said.
   Analysts say Burger King, which accounts for about one-third of
Pillsbury's sales and two-thirds of its profits, is a prime example
of the parent company's recent problems with some of its food
operations.
   Since Pillsbury took over the Miami-based chain in 1967, it has
had five chairmen and eight presidents. Most recently, Charles S.
Olcott resigned the presidency last month after two years.
   William Maguire, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York,
said Olcott ``wasn't a marketing man when they needed a marketing
man badly.''
   Burger King's pre-tax profits were down more than 50 percent in
the year ended May 31, to $48.2 million, from $119.2 million in the
previous year.
   Its systemwide sales rose 7 percent to $5.40 billion in the year
ended May 31, but net sales _ which includes sales only at
company-owned restaurants as well as royalties and fees from
franchised restaurants _ dropped 5.4 percent to $1.84 billion from
$1.95 billion the previous year.
   Average sales per store also fell 1 percent to just over $1
million.
   The company concedes that part of the problem has been
inconsistent marketing.
   Burger King dumped its advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson,
last fall after an association of 11 years.
   Thompson had created advertising in the early 1980's that
compared Burger King's flame-broiled approach to cooking with that
used by McDonald's. The campaign was credited for helping lift
Burger King sales.
   But campaigns in more recent years failed to provide the same
spark. Burger King's search for the nerdy Herb bombed, and its
subsequent ``This is a Burger King Town'' and ``Best Food for Fast
Times'' failed to produce sales gains.
   In late September 1987, Burger King selected N.W. Ayer & Co. as
its new agency. In early 1988, it rolled out its new ad theme ``We
Do It Like You'd Do It.'' The company said that the campaign has
helped boost awareness of Burger King's name even if sales have not
shot higher.
   Other problems also have arisen. Last month, twelve of the
chain's black franchisees sued the company on the grounds it
assigned black operators unprofitable locations, reserving more
lucrative outlets for white franchise holders.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Board Considering Sale Of Food Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. is adding another element to the
epic takeover battle for the food and tobacco conglomerate, with its
board of directors considering the possible sale of its food
businesses in advance of any takeover.
   The possible sale of the food businesses, which last year
accounted for about 60 percent of the company's $15.8 billion in net
sales, was announced Monday by the special committee appointed by
the board to evaluate the unprecedented multibillion-dollar buyout
offers already made for RJR Nabisco.
   The committee also said it had set a Nov. 18 deadline for
submission of any proposals to acquire either the entire company or
just its tobacco businesses, and warned bidders that it would not
consider their offers if they did not agree to the terms it set for
the auction.
   RJR Nabisco already is the target of a record $20.3 billion
tender offer _ worth $90 a share _ by the New York investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. and a rival proposal by Nabisco
management to acquire the company for $20.7 billion, or $92 a share.
   The New York buyout firm Forstmann Little & Co. announced last
week it led an investor group _ including consumer products giant
Procter & Gamble Co., the investment firm Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
Ralston Purina Co. _ interested in a possible counteroffer that
would surpass both existing bids.
   RJR stock rose $1.75 a share to $87.37{ in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading on Monday.
   The special committee said that if the board decided to sell
RJR's food businesses, the after-tax proceeds would be paid to
shareholders before any acquisition of RJR.
   ``Accordingly, parties are invited to submit proposals on a basis
which, in effect, would involve acquiring RJR Nabisco as a
stand-alone tobacco company,'' the committee stated.
   Furthermore, the committee has ordered its financial advisers to
explore available alternatives other than a buyout of the company.
   Industry analysts have estimated RJR Nabisco's food businesses
would bring a sale price ranging from $12.5 billion to $15.5 billion.
   Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco makes such well-known brands as Winston
and Camel cigarettes, Oreo cookies and Del Monte vegetables.
   The committee said it had made no final decision on whether to
sell the company or any of its parts, and that the board had decided
to take no position on the pending tender offer by Kohlberg Kravis.
   In addition, the committee stated it was inviting the inclusion
in bids of a ``substantial common stock-related equity component.''
The panel's announcement did not elaborate on the reasons for the
request, although including stock in their offers would enable
bidders to increase the value of their bids without having to come
up with more cash.
   The panel also warned that it would consider any attempt to bid
for the company outside of its guidelines would be considered a
hostile overture, and neither the special committee nor the board
would consider offers from any bidders that had not agreed to those
terms.
   A buyout of the RJR Nabisco food businesses would mirror the
recent trend that has seen the acquisitions and sometimes breaking
up of the nation's biggest food companies.
   Last month, Kraft Inc. agreed to be acquired by food and tobacco
giant Philip Morris Companies Inc. in a $13.1 billion buyout, the
second-biggest U.S. corporate acquisition ever. There also is a
battle being waged by Pillsbury Co. against a $5.2 billion hostile
buyout offer by Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC, a food, liquor and
real estate conglomerate.
   The big food companies are considered attractive because of their
established brand names and relative steady businesses, which are
regarded as recession proof.

   The dollar was slightly lower but stable against
most major currencies in lethargic European trading this morning as
the market awaited the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said the market was focused almost exclusively on the
election, leaving little room for other factors to influence the
dollar.
   They predicted that if Vice President George Bush is elected as
is expected, the dollar would fall by a few pfennigs against the
West German mark.
   ``I can imagine that the dollar will drop to 1.75 marks and then
we'll have to see at what point the central banks step in,'' said a
dealer at a large Frankfurt bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.34 yen to a closing 124.73 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 125.25 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7780 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7755 late Monday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Monday's rates, included: 1.7825 West German marks, down from
1.7840; 1.4950 Swiss francs, down from 1.4965; 6.0815 French francs,
unchanged; 2.0060 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0148; 1,324.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,327.75; and 1.2330 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2374.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $422 a troy ounce, up
slightly from a late bid price of $421.75 on Monday. At mid-morning,
the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$421.85.
   In Zurich, gold rose and was trading at a mid-morning bid
$422.05, compared with $420.65 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where the metal
was trading at a mid-morning bid price of $6.48 a troy ounce,
compared with Monday's $6.45.

   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen
today and share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.73 yen, down 0.34 yen from Monday's
close of 125.07 yen. Opening lower at 124.50 yen, the currency moved
between 124.45 and 124.75 yen.
   Currency trading was cautious ahead of today's U.S. presidential
election, said Takamasa Yamasaki with the Daiwa Bank.
   ``But I guess traders in Tokyo seemed to have bought too many
dollars, considering it's right before the election,'' he said.
   Although the dollar moved below the 125-yen level all day, the
Bank of Japan did not intervene, Yamasaki said, ``probably because
the central bank did not want to make any move before the election.''
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 180.39-point
loser the previous day, regained 140.91 points, or 0.51 percent, to
move back to 28,007.27. The index was lower in early trading but
gradually recovered afterwards. On Monday, the Nikkei closed at
27,866.36 points.
   Market players also had been quite cautious ahead of the U.S.
election, but the index started to recover as more people came to
believe Republican Vice President George Bush will win, said a
dealer with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   ``Investors are expecting no major change in the U.S. monetary
policy if Bush wins,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The election pits Bush against Democratic Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   Trading volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million
shares, with high-tech issues attracting investors.

<TEXT>
   The 4,800 unionized pilots for Northwest
Airlines have begun voting on whether to support a strike deadline
set by their negotiators, a union spokesman said.
   Pilots have until 3 p.m. CST Thursday to cast their ballots for
or against the strike deadline of midnight Sunday. The deadline was
set after contract talks between the Eagan-based airline and the Air
Line Pilots Association reached an impasse Nov. 1. No new talks are
scheduled.
   ``We're very encouraged at the participation level to this
point,'' Jim Halverson, an ALPA representative, said Monday. ``There
are a lot of pilots who are still out and about and flying.''
   Results won't be announced until balloting closes, he said. A
majority of those voting must support the strike deadline for the
measure to pass.
   Nothwest has said it is considering mediation as an option to
settle the dispute, but spokesman Red Tyler said Monday that no
request has been made. Halverson said the union isn't interested in
mediation.
   Talks have been held 102 times during the last 19 months and
Halverson said more than half the contract issues are unresolved.
   The carrier and union are negotiating for a combined contract
covering 2,800 pre-merger Northwest pilots and 2,000 former Republic
pilots. The two pilot groups have been working under separate
contracts since Northwest's acquisition of Republic in 1986.
   There are differences over wages, work schedules, fringe benefits
and length of contract.
   Tyler said Northwest does not expect a work stoppage, regardless
of the outcome of the strike vote.
   Northwest wants a contract effective through June 30, 1993, while
the union is seeking a pact that expires June 30, 1990.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, airline contracts continue in effect
until they are amended by the parties or until efforts to reach new
contracts are exhausted.

   A maker of components used in high-tech
weapons systems has been ordered to pay $725,000 in fines and
restitution for selling untested parts to the U.S. Navy and Coast
Guard.
   Genisco Technology Corp. was also placed on five years probation
Monday after company officials pleaded guilty last month to one
count of conspiracy to defraud the government.
   Genisco, based in Rancho Dominguez, about 12 miles south of
downtown Los Angeles, also pleaded guilty to three counts of
submitting false statements in 1986 and 1987 to the Navy regarding a
torpedo and underwater target device.
   Three former Genisco employees pleaded guilty to the charges and
were scheduled for sentencing Nov. 21.
   In another defense fraud case, a company vice president pleaded
guilty Monday to submitting false claims for payment on a military
contract, causing more than $220,000 in losses to the Defense
Department.
   Howard Garner, 45, of Diversified Container Corp. admitted
wrongdoing on two counts, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Hennigan
said.
   The company was awarded a contract to build floodlights for the
Defense General Supply Corp. in Richmond, Va., and submitted claims
saying 90 percent of the job had been completed.
   The company, based in La Puente, about 20 miles east of downtown
Los Angeles, received more than $226,000 as a result and later went
bankrupt after delivering only a few floodlights.

   Stock prices were higher Tuesday, but institutional
buying interest was light amid uncertainty over how the market will
react to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.
   Market makers were busy marking prices higher in an attempt to
generate excitement and draw buyers into the market, dealers said.
But there were few takers, and much of the turnover came as market
makers moved to trim their books ahead of the election results, they
said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 15
points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,834.7 at midday.
   Volume was light, as 288.3 million shares changed hands, compared
with 186.4 million shares at the same time Monday.
   Traders generally expected a U.S. election victory by Vice
President George Bush. While confirmation of these expectations
could give the market a temporary boost, questions lingered about
whether the new U.S. president would take the necessary measures to
correct the country's economic ills, especially the massive budget
and trade deficits, they said.
   ``A post-election skepticism is already creeping into the
market,'' said one equity salesman. ``Is he (Bush) really the man to
change things?''

<TEXT>
   New World Entertainment Ltd. said it has
reached a tentative agreement to sell its Marvel Comics division for
$82.5 million to a company controlled by Revlon Chairman Ronald O.
Perelman.
   New World, which is trying to come back after losses in 1987 and
the first half of this year, said Monday said it expected to close
the deal soon.
   Marvel makes comic books featuring such characters as Superman,
G.I. Joe, the Incredible Hulk and Spiderman. The sale will not
include the company's Marvel Productions unit, which produces two
Saturday morning animated cartoon programs, New World said.
   At a price of $82.5 million, New World would make a sizable
profit on its investment of $46 million paid less than two years ago
when it acquired Marvel from Cadence Industries.
   In 1987, Marvel generated $2.3 million in operating income, while
New World's other core businesses showed an operating loss of $4.1
million.
   Last year, New World lost $18.5 million on revenue of $384.3
million. It lost $24.2 million on revenue of $203 million in the
first half of 1988.

   The stock market rebounded in early trading this
election day, after two days of sharp declines influenced by
investor concern about the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 11.56 points at
2,136.20 after the first 30 minutes of trading at 10 a.m.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining issues by about 11 to 4 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 709 issues up, 256 down and 446
unchanged.
   Analysts said the market appeared to be bouncing back from
declines the two previous days sparked by last Friday's economic
data and pre-election worries. An unexpectedly low jobless rate
suggested the economy might be heating up again, reviving concern
about higher inflation and interest rates.
   This morning's early rebound also came on technical factors as
bond prices opened higher on the first day of the U.S. Treasury's
refunding.
   Observers said they expected volume to be light during most of
the day, with many major players out for election day and other
investors awaiting the outcome of the presidential poll.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial average lost 21.16 points to
close the day at 2,124.64 on what analysts said was pre-election
nervousness and lingering concern about last week's unemployment
report.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,200 issues
down, 314 up and 444 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 133.87 million shares, down from
143.58 million in Friday's session.

   Stock prices were higher in moderate trading
today, in what observers predicted would be a relatively quiet
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 10.32 points at
2,134.96 at 11 a.m. The blue-chip indicator was up more than 11
points an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining issues by about 7 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 811 issues up, 346 down and 542
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 50.99 million shares.
   Analysts said today's presidential elections would take many
players out of the market, while others would remain noncommital
until after the poll results.
   Late Monday, some observers said that Wall Street already had
built a George Bush victory into the market and had begun to turn
its attention to post-election concerns, like the federal budget
deficit.
   Analysts had attributed Monday's broad declines partly to
pre-election jitters following weekend polls that suggested Michael
Dukakis might be closing in on George Bush's lead.
   This morning, analysts said investors seemed to put aside their
nervousness about the election's outcome.
   ``In some sense it's a no-win situation in the election,'' said
Larry Wachtel, vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``If Dukakis wins the market is down 100 points. If Bush wins, the
market yawns.''
   Analysts said today's market appeared to be bouncing back from
declines the two previous days sparked by recent economic reports.
An unexpectedly low jobless rate for October combined with other
data suggested the economy might be heating up again.
   A stronger economy could signal higher inflation and, in turn,
higher interest rates if the Federal Reserve moves to slow the
economy.
   This morning's early rebound also came on technical factors as
bond prices opened higher on the first day of the U.S. Treasury's
refunding, analysts said.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.83 at
155.11. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market index
gained 1.44 to 294.91.

<TEXT>
   Under pressure from creditors who threatened
court action to oust him, the trustee appointed to run Sharon Steel
Corp. during the company's reorganization in bankruptcy court
announced his resignation Tuesday.
   ``The job has been far more demanding than I expected, and I
don't want to continue in a role that takes such a heavy toll on my
life,'' trustee James W. Toren said.
   His resignation, filed Monday in Erie with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Warren Bentz, takes effect when a successor is appointed and
confirmed by the court.
   Creditors told Toren, 73, at an Oct. 7 meeting that they would
petition the court for his removal if he did not resign.
   Toren, who was appointed in January, infuriated creditors in June
when he suspended negotiations in which the company was seeking
contract concessions from 2,100 members of the United Steelworkers
union. He reasoned that the workers should not be asked for
concessions until the company's financial condition was clear.
Creditors argued that enough was known to seek wage and benefit
givebacks.
   Among other actions, Toren sued Sharon Chairman Victor Posner for
the return of 14 Norman Rockwell paintings that hung in Posner's
Miami Beach office and for a refund from the $16.2 million Posner
paid himself between 1983 and late 1987.
   Chief Operating Officer Walter Sieckman says Sharon, whose lone
steel plant is in this western Pennsylvania community, is marginally
profitable. Creditors claim the company is still losing money.
   Employment at the Victor Posner Works has increased by several
hundred in recent months to about 2,500.

   Coleco Industries Inc. plans to close
its Canadian subsidiary and rely on a Toronto toy company to market
its products in that country.
   The move, announced Monday, is part of cost-cutting steps by
Coleco, which filed in July for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
   About 50 employees of Coleco (Canada) Ltd. will be affected by
the closing.
   J. Brian Clarke, Coleco's president and chief executive officer,
said sales from the Canadian subsidiary are typically about 10
percent of Coleco's total sales.
   Coleco had total sales of $504 million in 1987.
   The West Hartford toymaker said it reached an agreement with
Irwin Toy Ltd. to become the exclusive distributor in Canada of toys
and games sold by Coleco.
   Coleco's major products include Cabbage Patch Kids and ALF
stuffed toys.
   The agreement with Irwin is subject to approval of bankruptcy
Judge Prudence Abram in New York, who is handling Coleco's case.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher,
then turned mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Follow-through buying from Monday's late rally evaporated shortly
after the opening, leaving prices to drift in narrow ranges.
   ``It's a pretty quiet affair,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The rally that ended Monday's session was based on a news report
that the Soviet Union was considering buying 2 million metric tons
of U.S. soybeans or soybean meal, analysts said. After Monday's
close, the Agriculture Department announced the Soviets had
purchased 300,000 metric tons of meal.
   The sale announcement ``doesn't seem to have much influence in
today's market,'' Gustafson said.
   Traders were exercising caution ahead of Wednesday's USDA crop
production report, which is expected to show slight increases since
last month in the government's estimates for 1988 U.S. corn and
soybean production.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.19 a bushel; corn was {

73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher
with November at 81.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower

<HEAD>Trade Official Sharply Critical Of Germany's Decision On Airbus
Subsidy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.S. foreign trade representative has
sharply criticized the West German government for its decision to
take over an increased share of Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium.
   ``I find this a very disturbing development,'' Clayton Yeutter
said Monday. ``Such a unilalteral action by the West German
government at this time and in this manner will greatly increase
tensions in the trade arena,'' he added.
   Yeutter's statement followed the Bonn government's decision to
take over an increased share of Messerscmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB),
the weapons producer which is the parent company of Duetsche Airbus,
the German Airbus consortium partner.
   The decision is designed to offset potential losses on Airbus
manufacturing programs which West German officials blame on the high
exchange rate of the West German mark to the U.S. dollar.
   ``A decision to provide additional Airbus subsidies is
particularly unacceptable, coming as it does during ongoing
discussions between the Airbus partner governments and the United
States,'' the statement said.
   The lengthy negotiations within the framework of GATT, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is designed to determine
government subsidy levels for civilian aircraft manufacturers.
   The United States believes the French, German and British
governments' support for Airbus is unfair competition to Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas, two American companies that are Airbus' biggest
competitors.
   ``It is an essential tenet of private enterprise that business
firms absorb the risks associated with commercial ventures,
including exchange rate risks,'' Yeutter said. ``Why should Airbus
be singled out for special treatment?''
   Exchange rate fluctuations are part of the risks of international
business, Yeutter said, and they should not be borne ``by German
taxpayers or workers in other industries, either in Germany or the
United States.''
   When the U.S. dollar was strong, the United States did not
subsidize American manufacturers despite their loss of
competitiveness, Yeutter said. ``Similarly, we expect other
countries to avoid such temptations,'' his statement said.
   Yeutter said he would be meeting soon with West German officials
to review their decision ``and examine the consistency of such
support with the Federal Republic of Germany's international
obligations.''

<HEAD>EEC: Ban On Hormone-Treated Meat Is On</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said
Tuesday a ban on imports of hormone-treated meat will take effect as
planned Jan. 1, despite threats of retaliation from the United
States.
   ``One must count on a total ban of hormones from the beginning of
next year,'' a spokesman for the EEC executive Commission said.
   Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative, and Richard Lyng,
the U.S. agriculture secretary, are to arrive in Brussels Nov. 18 to
discuss the hormone ban and other trade issues with senior EEC
Commission officials.
   The EEC ban on meat treated with growth hormones stems from fears
such meat causes cancer.
   But the United States claims there is no scientific justification
for a blanket ban on hormones in meat and argues the EEC ban amounts
to an unfair trade practice.
   The ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988 but was delayed by
a year in the hope a compromise solution could be negotiated.
   But as negotiations reached a deadlock in recent months, five
U.S. industry groups have asked the administration to restrict or
cutoff imports of EEC meat or meat products if the EEC imposes its
hormone ban.
   President Reagan has already announced, but not enacted, 100
percent tariffs on EEC meat and meat products if the ban is imposed.
   The United States exports about $100 million worth of meat and
meat products to the EEC each year. By comparison, EEC exports to
the United States total some $450 million.
   The EEC Commission spokesman reiterated the EEC view that growth
hormones must be banned from meat for health reasons and that no
proof has been offered to show that the use of hormones is safe.
``There are no new elements as far as we're concerned,'' he said.
   He added Italy, Denmark, West Germany and Belgium had already
banned domestic sales of hormone-treated meat before the EEC
decision was implemented EEC-wide on Jan. 1 of this year.

<HEAD>Icahn Still Potential Bidder for Eastern, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Carl Icahn, the chairman and owner of
Trans World Airlines Inc., still is considering making a bid for
ailing Eastern Airlines after abandoning an earlier effort,
according to a published report.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted TWA General
Counsel Mark Buckstein as saying a bid by Icahn for Eastern is ``a
possibility.''
   Last month, Icahn broke off efforts to acquire Eastern, after
failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the airline's
militant unions.
   Texas Air Corp., the parent of Eastern, recently agreed to sell
Eastern's profitable shuttle service to developer Donald Trump for
$365 million in cash.
   Buckstein told the Post that an Icahn bid for the rest of Eastern
would depend on the financier's ability to conclude favorable labor
contracts at TWA and on working out an agreement with Eastern's
unions.
   Icahn said in a statement issued Monday that the best way for TWA
to achieve needed growth is through acquisitions, although he did
not specifically mention Eastern.
   ``There was no question TWA must grow to thrive, and ... by far
the most preferable way for the airline to grow is through
acquisitions,'' he said.
   TWA announced Monday that its president, D. Joseph Corr, has
resigned and it is restructuring its top management. The airline,
which was privatized on Oct. 24, created a new ``office of the
chairman'' comprised of Icahn and two other top officials.
   Icahn's statement fueled speculation on Wall Street that he is
seeking to sell part or all of TWA, the Wall Street Journal said
today.
   Icahn, who holds 90 percent of the shares of TWA, told the
Journal that the airline isn't for sale. ``I've been saying that for
three years. I can't make it any plainer,'' he said.
   The Journal and the Post also noted rumors in financial circles
that more than half a dozen other potential bidders for Eastern may
be on the horizon.
   Corr, the departing TWA president, was mentioned as an interested
party, as well as Morton Ehrlich, who recently resigned as TWA's
executive vice president.
   The Post quoted union sources as saying a group of St. Louis
investors also are trying to make a bid for Eastern.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo told the Journal that Eastern is
not for sale. When he agreed to sell the shuttle to Trump, however,
Lorenzo indicated that the rest of Eastern might be sold if the
price were right.
   ``There are all kinds of coconuts out there that can be dressed
up as a buyer (for Eastern),'' Lorenzo said.

   The stock market was up slightly in subdued
trading today, but had given up most of its earlier gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.63 points at
2,129.27 at noon EST. The blue-chip indicator had advanced more than
11 points 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining issues by about 12 to 7 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 794 issues up, 460 down and 541
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 73.34 million shares.
   Analysts said the market opened stronger in anticipation of a
George Bush victory in today's presidential election. But by midday,
investors seemed to be taking more of a wait-and-see posture.
   ``The market has given back earlier gains because even if Bush
wins, the outlook for interest rates is higher,'' said C. Beth
Cotner of Kemper Financial Services.
   Analysts said that even with a Bush victory, investors were
restrained as they began looking ahead to the post-election economy.
   Trading was relatively quiet with many banks and insurance
companies closed for election day.
   Stock prices had declined sharply in the previous two sessions on
what analysts said were concerns about inflation, interest rates and
the federal deficit.
   Recent statistics have suggested the economy is growing more
briskly than expected, renewing fears of higher inflation. A
stronger economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to slow growth by
raising interest rates.
   This morning's early rebound also came on technical factors as
bond prices opened higher on the first day of the U.S. Treasury's
refunding, analysts said.
   At noon EST, the New York Stock Exchange composite index was up
0.59 at 154.87. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market
index gained 1.09 to 294.56.

<HEAD>Harris Announces Definitive GE Semiconductor Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harris Corp. on Tuesday said it has signed
a definitive agreement covering its previously-disclosed plan to buy
General Electric Co.'s solid state semiconductor business for $206
million.
   Purchase of the unit, initially announced Aug. 15, will boost
Harris' semiconductor sales by $550 million to $850 million, said
John T. Hartley, Harris chairman and chief executive officer.
   Harris, which had overall sales of $2.1 billion last year,
supplies information, communication and semiconductor systems,
products ansd services to government and commercial markets
worldwide.
   The deal has come under fire from some Wall Street analysts who
question the company's commitment to the volatile semiconductor
market, and say that the purchase will dilute earnings.
   ``You either want to be in the semiconductor business or you
don't, and we do,'' Hartley responded. ``This is a chance to take a
major step forward, a giant leap to become one of the major American
players in the semiconductor business.''
   The new division, which takes the name Harris Semiconductor, will
make Harris the nation's sixth largest producer of semiconductors,
the company said.
   Hartley said the GE business was particularly attractive because
of its close fit with Harris, adding an international dimension to
company sales _ especially in Europe and the Pacific Rim _ and
expertise in specialized market sectors, such as high-power
conductors used in the automotive industry.
   He acknowledged that the semiconductor market was cyclical in the
short run, but said it has shown excellent long-run growth, and that
Harris has learned to manage around the sector's volatility.
   Another doubt surrounding the deal is the forecast for flat or
declining budgets in the Defense Department, one of the industry's
largest clients.
   But Hartley said while defense expenditures overall are expected
to be stagnant, the electronic components sector is projected to
show modest growth.
   ``And it's a very large budget,'' he added.
   The company, which has committed itself to raising
earnings-per-share, said the purchase will not dilute shareholders'
return.
   ``We do not expect this to be dilutive,'' Hartley said. ``We
expect this to be a contributor to earnings in both the long run and
the short run.''
   Hartley said he expects to sign a financing agreement for the
deal in 30 days. He said Harris expects to have some increase in
debt, which could come from some combination of public financing,
bank borrowing or internal cash generation.
   Hartley also said that while Harris does not currently compete
directly with the Japanese, who dominate the high-volume,
lower-price end of the semiconductor market, the purchase positions
Harris to fend off any future such competition.
   ``I think you have to be a certain size to fight with the
Japanese, and this will help,'' Hartley said.

   Share prices rose sharply Tuesday on the London
Stock Exchange on speculation that Republican George Bush would win
the presidential election in the United States.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 20.9
points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,840.6. The narrower Financial Times
30-share index was up 16 points at 1,491.
   Volume rose to 502.8 million shares from 334.5 million shares
Monday.
   Over the past several sessions, shares fell as polls showed
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis was closing the gap on Bush.
But, with voting under way, market watchers bet on Bush.
   ``Suddenly, there seems to be a bit more confidence seeping into
the market and with another Republican in the White House, buying is
back in style,'' one market maker said.
   Another market-maker said, ``People seem to have come to the
conclusion that if Bush wins, we'll see some sort of rally, so we're
all a bit loath to get caught short.''

   Manville Corp. on Tuesday announced it plans to
sell its Newark, Ohio-based Holophane lighting systems division.
   Alfred B. Gough, who heads Manville's Specialty Products Group,
said Holophane has been profitable but its ``specific market niche
no longer strategically fits our core businesses or future growth
plans.''
   Holophane is expected to have sales in excess of $100 million
this year, Manville said.
   Gough said Manville, which has just emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, has received considerable unsolicited
interest in Holophane in recent years.
   Holophane designs and makes lighting fixtures and accessories for
commercial and industrial use. It employs more than 1,200 people at
plants in Edison, N.J.; Newark, Pataskala, Utica and Springfield,
Ohio; Brampton, Ontario; St. Hyacinthe, Quebec; and Milton Keynes,
England.
   Manville makes fiber glass, forest products and specialty
products including mining, filtration and roofing products. It
acquired Holophane, which was founded in 1895 in Paris, in 1971.

   Societe Generale de Belgique announced
Tuesday that it has purchased an additional 40 percent interest in
the zinc company Vieille-Montagne, raising its stake in the metals
concern to 90 percent.
   Societe Generale said that it made the purchase at the price of
about $320 per share. Since Vieille-Montagne has 810,000 shares
outstanding, the total value of the latest purchase was about $103.7
million.
   The investment is one of the largest investments made by Societe
Generale in the wake of the unsuccessful takeover attempt earlier
this year by Italian entrepreneur Carlo De Benedettti. Societe
Generale is Belgium's largest holding company and Vieille-Montagne
is a major metals processor.
   The decision was made ``in conformity with the strategy of SGB to
reinforce its presence in the non-ferrous metals sector,'' according
to a company statement.
   SGB has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Union Miniere, through which
it held its previous stake of 50 percent in Vieille-Montagne.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of new export
sales of wheat and expectations of a new long-term grain agreement
with the Soviet Union.
   Analysts cited speculation that the Agriculture Department was
prepared to target China for a large amount of wheat at subsidized
prices. Rumors of upcoming wheat sales to China and Iraq also
surfaced.
   Also, with the U.S. presidential race over, many traders expected
the United States and the Soviet Union to finalize a new long-term
grain agreement within the next 10 days, said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``I think there seems to be a lot more expectation that next week
they'll meet again and settle their differences,'' he said.
   Corn followed wheat higher while the soybean market gained on
indications of increased overseas buying of vegetable oils, which
include soybean oil, Gustafson said.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 7{ cents higher with December
at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents higher with December
at $2.79 a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with

   Stock prices rose slightly in relatively quiet
trading today, as many investors stayed away from the market
awaiting the results of the presidential election.
   Analysts said the market opened higher on an enthusiastic note as
Wall Street anticipated a George Bush victory in the presidential
election. Stock prices declined throughout much of the day, but
regained some strength in the last half-hour of trading.
   Volume was light with many banks and insurance companies closed
for election day. Activity in blue-chip issues was duller than in
the broader market with institutional activity at a near standstill.
   The early excitement stemmed from a combination of factors,
including the results of a New Hampshire poll showing Bush an easy
victor. The polls closed in the tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch, N.H.,
while most people on the East Coast were still on their way to work.
   ``The market is waiting for the election results,'' said Eldon A.
Grimm, senior vice president at Birr, Wilson & Co. ``There are quite
a lot of people sitting on the sidelines waiting for movement one
way or the other.''
   The stock market had declined sharply in the previous two
sessions amid concerns that the economy is growing faster than
expected.
   Last Friday's Labor Department report showed that more people
found jobs in October than in the previous month, suggesting the
economy might be overheating. That report revived inflation worries
and concern that the Federal Reserve might move to slow the economy
by raising interest rates.
   This morning's early rebound came partly on technical factors as
bond prices opened higher on the first day of the U.S. Treasury's
refunding, analysts said. Those early gains later faded with many
Japanese investors withdrawing from trading activity to await word
on Emperor Hirohito's health.

   Limited Inc. announced Tuesday its third-quarter net income rose
1.7 percent as its sales began to recover from a year-long slump.
   Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has thrived while other
retailers stagnated, said its earnings rose 33 percent during the
quarter.
   Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, said it earned $70.4 million,
or 39 cents a share, during the quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $69.3
million, or 36 cents a share, in the same period of fiscal 1987.
   Sales at the specialty apparel retailer totaled $1.01 billion, up
13.5 percent from $891.7 million in the third quarter a year earlier.
   Limited showed signs of recovery during September and October
following a year of dismal sales. Many apparel retailers have seen
their sales slump and profits decline since the third quarter of
1987 as women shied away from the stores' fall and spring fashions.
   Some observers believe Limited, whose divisions include Limited,
Limited Express, Lerner, Victoria's Secret and Lane Bryant stores,
will lead the industry recovery.
   Limited Chairman Leslie Wexner said ``things began to feel
normal'' during the latest quarter.
   The company _ and other retailers _ will be hoping for continued
improvement during the fourth quarter, when storeowners earn more
than half their annual profits.
   Limited reported its earnings for the first three quarters fell
27.3 percent to $125 million, or 69 cents a share, from $171.9
million, or 90 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1987.
   The year-to-date figures reflect the slump in the apparel
industry.
   Sales for the period rose 7.5 percent to $2.71 billion from $2.52
billion for the first three quarters last year.
   There were no surprises in Wal-Mart's earnings report, as the
discount store chain performed as well as industry analysts expected.
   Wal-Mart, which has more than 1,300 stores in 25 states, said it
earned $180.9 million, or 32 cents per share, during the quarter
ended Oct. 31, up from $136.1 million, or 24 cents per share, a year
earlier.
   The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., reported sales of $4.99
billion, up 24.1 percent from $4.02 billion in the third quarter of
1987.
   Although most general retailers have had sluggish sales for more
than a year and a half, Wal-Mart's low-price strategy has helped the
company escape the problems its competitors have encountered. The
company, which has some of the lowest expenses in the business, has
not had to undergo the cost-cutting steps that other retailers have
been forced to implement.
   Wal-Mart reported year-to-date earnings of $514 million, or 91
cents per share, up 35 percent from $380.5 million, or 67 cents per
share, in the same period of 1987.
   The discounter said its sales increased 28.2 percent to $14.12
billion from $10.96 billion in the first nine months of 1987.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and former White
House chief of staff Howard Baker said Tuesday they have conferred
professionally about Drexel's internal operations, but denied a
report that the discussions were related to a criminal investigation
of the Wall Street investment giant.
   The Washington Post, quoting sources it did not identify, said
Drexel was negotiating with Baker about becoming its chairman, a
move that some of the firm's officials reportedly see as a say of
escaping criminal charges.
   Drexel, one of the biggest U.S. investment companies, has been
under intense scrutiny for nearly two years by Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani as a result of its relationship with
Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned insider trader who has turned
state's evidence.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Drexel two months
ago of numerous securities fraud violations. A grand jury impaneled
by Giuliani has sent so-called target letters to the firm and other
prospective defendants, a strong signal that criminal charges may be
filed.
   Drexel has denied wrongdoing.
   The Washington Post story implied Drexel might be tapping Baker
as part of a broader strategy to convince Giuliani that criminal
charges are unwarranted. Baker knows Giuliani and offered him the
SEC chairmanship last year, but the prosecutor declined.
   Baker, a highly respected statesman and former Tennessee senator
who quit the White House job July 1 for personal reasons,
acknowledged through spokesman Thomas Griscom that he and his
Knoxville law firm had been working with Drexel on ``internal
governance matters of corporate operations. There is no involvement
with the impending legal action.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder also issued a statement saying
the firm has been working with Baker and his law firm, Baker
Worthington Crossley Stansberry & Woolf, on ``matters relating to
internal corporate governance.''
   The statement said those discussions are ``unrelated to either
the ongoing investigation by the U.S. attorney or any Washington
matters.''
   Both spokesmen said it would be inappropriate to comment further.
   Giuliani said through spokesman Edward Schwartz that he would
have no comment.
   Securities lawyers familiar with the Drexel case and Giuliani's
record expressed strong doubts that the firm would even contemplate
recruiting Baker to avoid an indictment or negotiate a plea bargain.
   For one thing, they said, such a move would smack of impropriety.
Moreover, they said, it was inconsistent with Baker's irreproachable
reputation and Giuliani's tough record on white collar defendants.
   ``If Drexel thinks it can influence the outcome of an
investigation that has gone on for nearly two years by doing that,
they're nuts. They've got to be out of their minds to think that,''
said Ira L. Sorkin, a former SEC regional commissioner and federal
prosecutor who is now in private practice.
   ``The target letters have already gone out,'' he said. ``Now
comes Howard Baker and waves his magic wand? It makes no sense to
me. It's crazy, insane.''
   Some lawyers speculated Drexel had retained Baker's firm as part
of a broader policy of seeking highly respected public figures to
help make corporate policy changes and enhance its public image to
combat the negative publicity of a possible indictment.
   Other major firms have recruited well-known Washington
personalities. Former White House budget director David Stockman,
for example, was hired by Salomon Brothers Inc.; former
Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis was tapped to head Union Pacific
Corp; former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker joined the
investment banking firm of James D. Wolfensohn & Co.
   ``I don't believe any one at Drexel would be talking to Howard
Baker for any influence in the criminal investigation,'' said Gerald
Walpin, a securities-law attorney and former federal prosecutor in
New York.
   ``If they are talking to him, they may be looking for something
to add to the response to the attacks made on them in the media.
They're trying to put the best face forward,'' Walpin said. ``That's
not unusual, to seek out somebody who has a fine reputation in the
public in order to create the best possible image.''

   The dollar rose in foreign exchange trading
Tuesday as dealers adjusted their positions in anticipation of a
presidential victory by Republican Vice President George Bush.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $418.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from
$422.25 on Monday.
   Dealers around the world attributed the dollar's gains to
increased confidence that Bush would defeat Democrat Michael Dukakis
in the presidential election.
   ``The anticipation of a Bush victory has led to some position
adjustment ahead'' of the official results, said James McGroarty, a
vice president at Discount Corp.
   ``There's been some anticipatory buying on the feeling that if
Bush is elected and there are a fair majority of Republicans in
Congress, the dollar could to higher,'' he added.
   Currency traders have the impression that Bush will extend the
prosperity of the Reagan years, while Dukakis's tough stand on trade
issues provokes fears of protectionist legislation. McGroarty noted
that foreign investors, therefore, remain more comfortable with the
Reagan-era policies.
   The U.S. currency also drew some support earlier overseas from
rumors that Japanese Emperor Hirohito had died, prompting some
players to switch out of yen and into dollars.
   There was concern that the death of the emperor, who remained
critically ill Tuesday, would require businesses to close for a
mourning period in Japan just when currency dealers would be
reacting to the U.S. election.
   The mood in the market was described as ``moderately cautious''
by David Ogg, a vice president at Credit Suisse in New York.
``Everybody thinks there's news coming out, but that's not 'til the
polls close.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.34 yen to a closing 124.73 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted at 125.59 yen. In New York the dollar jumped to 125.70
yen, from 124.63 yen on Monday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7707 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7755 late Monday. In New
York, it cost $1.7705 to buy one pound, less expensive than Monday's
$1.7804.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.7893 West German marks, up from 1.7772; 1.5026
Swiss francs, up from 1.4888; 6.1060 French francs, up from 6.0675;
1,328.50 Italian lire, up from 1,320.38, and 1.2341 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2358.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.7990 West German marks, up from 1.7840; 1.5005
Swiss francs, up from 1.4965; 6.1065 French francs, up from 6.0815;
2.0190 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0148; 1,330.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,327.75, and 1.2350 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2374.
   Gold prices slumped. On New York's Commodity Exchange, the price
of one troy ounce of gold fell to $419.10, from $422.80 on Monday.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid of $418.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $421.75 late on Monday. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $418.50, compared with $420.65 late Monday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold rose 40 cents to close at a bid $422.35 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices on New York's Comex slid to $6.393 a troy
ounce, from $6.490 on Monday. In London the metal was trading at a
late bid price of $6.41 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $6.45.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Prices Tumble On Election-Day Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of platinum, gold and silver futures fell sharply Tuesday
as nervous traders cashed out of the precious-metals markets to
await the presidential election results.
   On other markets, copper futures posted strong gains after three
days of declines; energy futures fell; grains and soybeans were
mostly higher; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   The platinum market led the precious-metals complex lower, partly
on speculation that a likely Republican presidential victory would
mean continued low inflation and low investment demand for precious
metals, and partly on profit-taking by traders unwilling to bet on
the outcome of the presidential race.
   ``On the eve of the results of the presidential election, some
people just determined there was too much risk involved in having
any position and they went to liquidate,'' said Richard Levine, vice
president of precious metals and foreign exchange trading with
Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   After a month of solid gains, traders who had bought platinum
futures in late September at prices below $500 a troy ounce realized
substantial profits.
   The contract for January delivery of platinum on the New York
Mercantile Exchange settled at $573 a troy ounce, $14.80 below
Monday's final price.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was $3.60 to $3.70 lower
with December at $421.20 a troy ounce; silver was 9.7 cents to 10.6
cents lower with December at $6.425 a troy ounce.
   The dollar's gains Tuesday against other currencies and the
weakening oil market also contributed to the sell-off of precious
metals, said Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with
Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   Despite Tuesday's decline, platinum supplies are tight and are
expected to remain so for the next several years.
   So ``no matter who wins, I would not be surprised to see the
rally pick up again,'' Levine said.
   Copper for December delivery jumped 3.4 cents to $1.423 a pound
on the Comex on reports of an escalation in the Peruvian miners'
strike.
   Late Monday, news circulated that banking and petroleum industry
workers might join the strike, which has brought copper mining and
smelting operations to a halt. The strike in Peru, the world's
seventh-largest copper producer, entered its fourth week on Tuesday.
   The price advance followed three days of declines and analysts
said the market was headed higher.
   ``Copper had three days of a good correction and the market is
just settling down and waiting for the next move to the upside,''
Cardillo said.
   Oil futures prices retreated in thin, choppy trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Nov. 17 price-committee
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the
Nov. 21 gathering of the full cartel.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 26 cents
lower with December at $13.80 a barrel; heating oil was 16 cents to
60 cents lower with December at 43.53 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent to .85 cent lower with December at 46.40 cents
a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid rumors of new export sales of wheat and
expectations of a new long-term grain agreement with the Soviet
Union.
   Talk circulated that the Agriculture Department was preparing to
target China for a large amount of wheat at subsidized prices,
analysts said. Rumors of upcoming wheat sales to China and Iraq also
surfaced.
   Also, with the U.S. presidential race over, many traders expected
the United States and the Soviet Union to finalize a new long-term
grain agreement within the next 10 days, said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 7\ cents higher with December at $4.26\
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2\ cents higher with December at
$2.78} a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.23 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 9} cents higher
with November at $7.96\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures finished
mixed in thin, featureless trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .22 cent higher with December at
73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with November at 81.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with December at 42 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .03 cent to .23 cent lower with February at 45.95
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 finished .35 point higher at 275.05.

<HEAD>New Bidder Would Sell Sunbeam-Oster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York merchant banking group vying to
acquire troubled Allegheny International Inc. said Tuesday it is
confident the company's Sunbeam Appliance and Oster buisnesses can
be sold off as part of the deal.
   Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn & Levy has proposed acquiring Allegheny
International in a deal valued at $703.5 million, of which $662.3
million would be in cash.
   The offer comes a week after Allegheny International's board
agreed to merge with a corporation formed by the investment firm
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette for $698 million, $537.6 million of
which would be in cash.
   Paul S. Levy, a principal in Gilliam Joseph, said the sale of the
Sunbeam-Oster division would be necessary for ``a very, very safe''
leveraged buyout of Allegheny International.
   The company has been operating under protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since early
this year.
   In a leveraged buyout, loans used to buy the company are secured
by the company's assets.
   Allegheny International management declined comment on the Levy
offer, although management is know to oppose the sale of its
Sunbeam-Oster business. Divesting the flagship operation would
reduce the company to a maker of patio furniture, electric blankets,
barbecue grills, weather instruments and bathroom scales.
   Levy said the offer would expire on Dec. 1.

   Almost 3,000 Gulf service stations in Texas,
Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico will be converted to the Chevron
brand at a cost of more than $50 million, a Chevron spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
   Spokeswoman Sherri Zippay said the switch should be concluded in
1989 and will give customers a ``consistent product coast-to-coast.''
   Houston's Gulf stations will be the first to undergo the change,
starting in January, she said.
   Only Chevron's Gulf stations in Oklahoma will survive the
conversion, Zippay said. In Oklahoma, the Chevron's Gulf business
accounts for less than four percent of the market and the cost of
converting there would outweigh the benefits, she said.
   Chevron Corp. and Gulf Oil Corp. merged in 1984.

<HEAD>Stocks Hold Slight Gains on Election Day</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market held on to slight gains after a
strong election-day opening Tuesday in anticipation of a victory by
Republican George Bush in the presidential vote.
   But analysts said that once the election is over, the market will
refocus on interest rates and other worries that have chilled the
market recently.
   The Dow Jones Industrial average advanced 2.85 points to close at
2,127.49, near its low of the day. The blue-chip indicator had
gained more than 14 points in early trading.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines by
about 3-to-2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 852 issues up, 578 down and 532 unchanged.
   ``It's a strange thing. We almost have to get the election out of
the way in order to focus on the issues,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior
vice president for First Albany Corp. ``People are taking a deep
breath and just starting to think about that.''
   Analysts attributed the early burst of enthusiasm partly to
anticipation of a Bush win after the nation's first poll showed the
vice president an easy victor.
   ``There was a little rebound in the market with returns from New
Hampshire. Based on that the market popped up,'' said Emmanuel
Geronimous, senior vice president with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The polls closed in the tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch, N.H.,
before most of the nation was awake.
   The stock market also got early support from higher bond prices
and a stronger dollar in foreign exchange trading as well as
technical factors. The market had declined sharply in two previous
sessions on what many analysts said was concern about the economy
and uncertainty about the outcome of the presidential election.
   Despite the early gains, stock prices faded early with few
institutional investors to lend the market support. Many banks and
insurance companies were closed for election day and volume was
relatively light.
   In addition, analysts said investors returned to a cautious mode,
preferring to wait for the election results before making new
commitments.
   ``It was kind of a fearful session,'' said Eldon A. Grimm, senior
vice president for Birr, Wilson & Co. ``After this long, bitter
election the market was waiting to get it over.''
   Analysts were mixed in their projections for Wednesday's market.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 141.66 million shares, up
from 133.87 million in Monday's session. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional
exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 167.795
million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market was $2,710.343 billion, up
$10.180 billion, or 0.38 percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index closed up 0.56 point at 154.84.
   Among blue-chip issues, IBM gained | to close at 119} and RJR

<HEAD>Zenith Amends Complaint Against Brookhurst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. said Tuesday it
had amended its lawsuit against Brookhurst Partners LP to include
new challenges to the dissident shareholder group's plan to sell the
company.
   The amended complaint, filed late Monday in U.S. District Court
in Chicago, charges that Brookhurst's ongoing consent solicitation
continues ``a consistent course of bad faith'' designed to mislead
other Zenith shareholders and fraudulently manipulate the price of
the company's stock.
   Brookhurst said through spokesman Thomas Franco that it ``knows
of no basis for Zenith's allegations ... and intends to vigorously
defend itself against what the partnership believes is a baseless
lawsuit.''
   Zenith originally filed the lawsuit on Sept. 29.
   Brookhurst, an investment group headed by New York stock-market
speculators Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L. Ihasz, is seeking
written consents from a majority of Zenith shareholders to reduce
the size of Zenith's board of directors from 10 to six and to have
three of its own people named to the board.
   The Brookhurst board members would be committed to selling
Zenith's ailing television-manufacturing division and, failing that,
to selling the entire company.
   Shareholders have until Dec. 4 to respond to the consent
solicitation.
   Zenith, the nation's last major manufacturer of televisions,
claims Brookhurst is really interested only in driving up the price
of Zenith's stock so it can sell its 6.1 percent stake in the
company at a substantial profit.
   The amended lawsuit says Brookhurst is misleading other
shareholders with its consent solicitation and challenges
Brookhurst's characterization of Paul Street, a Brookhurst nominee
to Zenith's board, as an expert on the consumer electronics industry.

Brothers, a predecessor to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He had served 21 years at Lehman Brothers, rising to the posts of
chairman and chief executive. Lehman Brothers was sold to
Shearson-American Express in May 1984.
   ``The opportunity to join Smith Barney and work with Frank Zarb
represents just the kind of challenge I've been looking for in the
industry I know and love best,'' Glucksman said in a prepared
statement. ...``I've thrived for many years for many years on
adapting to, and capitalizing on, the constant changes in this
industry, and look forward to the chance to do it again.''

the Copper Mountain ski resort, to a Canadian company, Horsham Corp.
of Toronto.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Barry S. Schermer approved the sale in a
68-page opinion issued late Monday afternoon. His ruling concludes a
key element of Apex's 10-month reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy lawes.
   Schermer overruled objections raised by Getty Petroleum Corp.,
which had a competing bid for the assets.
   Horsham will pay $536.5 million, while Getty was offering $588.5
million. But Horsham said its deal is worth an additional $150
million because of a discount it is getting on Apex's bank debt.
   Twelve banks agreed to sell $550 million in loans to Horsham for
$396 million, or 72 cents on the dollar. By buying the loans,
Horsham will eliminate bank liens on Clark, Copper Mountain and the
other assets it is buying, as well as on assets that will remain
part of Apex.
   Clark Oil owns three refineries, 1,000 service stations and 15
petroleum terminals. Copper Mountain is a ski resort in Colorado.
Horsham also is buying oil-exploration and -production companies and
interests in pipelines.
   The assets are expected to change hands by Nov. 25, which is a
deadline set by the banks for completion of the loan sale.
   Apex would be left with coal, real estate and shipping
operations. The company would remain in bankruptcy with proceedings
to focus on how much Apex's creditors would be paid.
   Unsecured creditors have filed about $900 million in claims
against Apex, one of the nation's largest private companies. Apex
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy law on Dec. 24, 1987.

   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
is preparing guidelines requiring nationally chartered banks to
consider more carefully their involvement in leveraged buyouts.
   Within the next few weeks, the agency will be sending new
guidelines to its examiners and to banks to help them evaluate when
an institution is vulnerable because of highly leveraged lending,
Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for Comptroller Robert Clarke, said Tuesday.
   Clarke's office regulates 4,450 of the nation's 13,400 commercial
banks.

   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn is reemerging as a
potential suitor for ailing Eastern Airlines after abandoning an
earlier effort.
   Analysts said Tuesday they expect Icahn, the owner and chairman
of Trans World Airlines Inc., to keep pursuing Eastern in light of
his pledge to press for acquisitions that would expand TWA's route
system and fleet of aircraft.
   Icahn is believed to be interested in Eastern's north-south
routes, especially between New York and Miami, as possible feeders
into TWA's trans-Atlantic system.

   The Supreme Court has upheld the authority of
the states to tax corporate income derived from sales of oil and
natural gas extracted from offshore wells under federal jurisdiction.
   By a 9-0 vote, the court approved Tuesday a tax method in Iowa
that is virtually identical to that used by most other states.
   The so-called unitary method, challenged unsuccessfully by Shell
Oil Co., allows a state to impose a tax on that portion of a
company's income calculated to come from the amount of business it
does within that state.

   The scope of a key federal anti-racketeering
law was at issue when the Supreme Court was urged to revive a
lawsuit by Minnesota customers against Northwestern Bell Telephone
Co.
   ``This case involved bribery over five years,'' lawyer Mark
Reinhardt of St. Paul contended Tuesday.
   He told the justices that a federal lawsuit under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act should not be blocked just
because a public utility allegedly paid the bribes.

   The high-level advisory commission on the
federal budget deficit, beset by deep divisions among panel members,
may delay issuing its recommendations for several months, the
co-chairman of the group says.
   Democrat Robert Strauss, one of two leaders of the bipartisan
National Economic Commission, said Tuesday that the group's report
may not be issued until March 1 or later.
   This would mark a turnabout from the commission's original goal
of issuing its recommendations by Dec. 21, in time to influence the
first budget submitted by the incoming administration.

   A New York merchant banking group vying to
acquire troubled Allegheny International Inc. says it is confident
the company's Sunbeam Appliance and Oster businesses can be sold off
as part of the deal.
   Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn & Levy has proposed acquiring Allegheny
International in a deal valued at $703.5 million, of which $662.3
million would be in cash.
   Paul S. Levy, a principal in Gilliam Joseph, said Tuesday that
the sale of the Sunbeam-Oster division would be necessary for ``a
very, very safe'' leveraged buyout of Allegheny International.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and former White
House chief of staff Howard Baker say they have conferred
professionally about Drexel's internal operations, but deny a report
that the discussions were related to a criminal investigation of the
Wall Street investment giant.
   The Washington Post said in Tuesday's editions that Drexel was
negotiating with Baker about him becoming its chairman, a move that
some of the firm's officials reportedly see as a way of escaping
criminal charges.
   Drexel has been under intense scrutiny for nearly two years by
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani's office as a result of
its relationship with Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned insider
trader who has turned state's evidence.

   A rainy autumn helped ease the dryness in the
East and some Central states, but large areas of the Upper Midwest
are facing winter still in the grip of long-term drought.
   ``Subsurface soil moisture is still very low in a lot of
states,'' Douglas LeComte, a meteorologist with the Department of
Agriculture, said Tuesday. ``That could come back to haunt us next
spring.''
   The federal Climate Analysis Center lists conditions of extreme
long-term drought as continuing in North Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming,
most of Montana and portions of South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa,
Oregon and California.

   The U.S. dollar edged up against the Japenese yen
Wednesday morning, while share prices also rose on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, encouraged by reports of George Bush's early lead in the
U.S. presidential election.
   The dollar by late morning was changing hands at 125.50 yen,
after opening at 125.52 yen, up from Tuesday's close of 124.73 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
140.91 points on Tuesday, was up another 154.98 points from
Tuesday's close at 28,162.25 to finish the morning session.
   The index rose on news of Republican Bush's early lead over
Democrat Michael Dukakis in the presidential election, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Many market players' expectations that a Bush victory would bring
no major change in the U.S. economic policy encouraged buying in the
Tokyo market, the dealer said.
   The dollar also was supported Wednesday by news of Bush's lead,
dealers said.
   However, many investors were waiting on the sidelines because of
concerns over a Japanese trade report due out Thursday, said a
dealer with a major commercial bank.
