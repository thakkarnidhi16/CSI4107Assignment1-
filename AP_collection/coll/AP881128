   Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, returned Monday from a five-day
visit to Cuba that he said may have provided a ``tiny nudge'' toward
improved relations.
   Pell's trip included a three-hour meeting with Cuban President
Fidel Castro, who he said is eager to resume normal diplomatic
relations with the United States.
   Pell, a Democrat, said he probably would report on the trip to
Secretary of State-designate James Baker when the two meet Wednesday.
   ``I think we may have given it a tiny nudge,'' Pell said in a
telephone interview after his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington. ``I think some little improvements could be
made, and out of those little improvements, big improvements could
follow.''
   He refused to cite specifics, but when pressed said the United
States and Cuba ``both need to pull in our horns a little bit and
(the United States should) tone down Radio Marti and not start TV
Marti.''
   Radio Marti aims American government-generated programming into
Cuba. A Pell aide said that during the senator's discussion with
Castro, the Cuban leader was very angry about plans to expand Radio
Marti to a television service and claimed that was one of the major
stumbling blocks to diplomatic relations.
   Pell said he doubted much could be done to stop the Reagan
administration's plans to launch the TV service.
   The senator said he suggested to Castro that releasing four
political prisoners remaining from the revolution in which Castro
came to power would be a good first step to improve relations with
the United States.
   `I don't want to be too optimistic about that. I certainly didn't
come back with any firm agreements,'' Pell said.
   It was Pell's third trip to the island and his first since 1974.
He said the change in presidents in this country and Cuba's recent
agreement to pull its troops out of the African nation of Angola
provide a window to improve relations.
   ``Peace seems to be breaking out in all parts of the world. There
is no reason it cannot break out in that little corner of the
Caribbean,'' he said.

   An ancient bronze vessel that was to be auctioned
in New York had been stolen in June from a Chinese museum, an
official report said Monday.
   China's Interpol office notified its U.S. counterpart Saturday of
the theft, and Chinese police met Monday with a U.S. Embassy
official to ask the U.S. government's help in recovering it.
   The ritual vessel, called a dui, was to be auctioned at Sotheby's
in New York on Tuesday, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   A Sotheby's spokesman in New York, Matthew Weigman, said the
auction house withdrew the vessel from its Tuesday sale of ``Fine
Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art'' at least two weeks ago. He said
Sotheby's was holding it pending a resolution of the dispute between
the owner and the Chinese government.
   Weigman said the owner had requested anonymity and that Sotheby's
withdrew the artifact after receiving a description of the missing
museum piece from a representative of the Chinese government.
   The vessel was made during China's Warring States Period, from
475 B.C. to 221 B.C., a period of conflict among rival princes
before what is now northern China was unified under the first
emperor.
   Xinhua said the vessel and 226 other Chinese antiques have been
on display at Sotheby's in New York since Thursday, but Weigman said
the vessel was not publicly displayed.
   The Xinhua report said Chinese police identified the dui from a
color photograph in a Sotheby's catalog, which did not identify the
owner and said it was expected to sell for $60,000 to $80,000.
   Chinese police say the dui in the catalog is identical in shape,
decoration and patina spots to one that was stolen June 4 from the
Qu Yuan Museum in Zigui County in central China's Hubei province.
The thieves were never caught.
   The dui was excavated in the county in 1983.
   An expert at Beijing's Palace Museum said craftsmen at the time
the piece was made were unable to cast identical bronze pieces.
   Millions of dollars worth of artifacts are smuggled out of China
each year, mostly through Hong Kong. Some are stolen from museums,
but most are discovered by peasants in their fields or by tomb
robbers, and the sites are wrecked before archaeologists can study
them.
   Weigman said an auction ``would actually be the worst possible
place'' to dispose of a stolen object because the process _ which
includes the publication of photographs and detailed descriptions of
every item _ is so public.

   An alleged drug dealer on Monday became the first
witness in the Joel Steinberg murder trial to claim to have
witnessed Steinberg hit his illegally adopted 6-year-old girl.
   Charles Scannapieco said Steinberg whacked the girl for no
apparent reason while she was asleep in Scannapieco's arms on Oct.
23, 1987, while they were driving in a car.
   Demonstrating the blow, Scannapieco slammed the back of his hand
against the bench of the trial judge, state Supreme Court Justice
Harold Rothwax. The judge, Steinberg and the jurors seemed startled.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is on trial for murder
in the beating of Lisa Steinberg, whom he illegally obtained from a
Long Island teen-ager. He smiled and shook his head as if in
disbelief at Scannapieco's dramatic gesture.
   Steinberg denies that he hit the child. He says she fell
unconscious after choking on food she had thrown up the night of
Nov. 1, 1987, and that he caused bruises on her chest and back while
trying to revive her.
   His former live-in lover, Hedda Nussbaum, who was dropped as a
defendant and is scheduled to testify against Steinberg, also filed
a $3 million civil lawsuit that was served Monday on Steinberg.
   The lawsuit alleges that Steinberg used humiliation,
brainwashing, drugs, and the withholding of food to teach Nussbaum
that ``she was a worthless person who could only be saved through
his wisdom and special powers.''
   Scannapieco, indicted on federal narcotics charges, said he and
Steinberg were driving together because he had hired Steinberg to
represent him at his arraignment in Albany the following morning,
Oct. 24, 1987.
   The witness said the child was cold in the car and he allowed her
to snuggle against his chest for warmth. After 10 to 15 minutes she
fell asleep.
   ``Right after she fell asleep,'' Scannapieco said, ``right out of
the clear blue sky, Mr. Steinberg took his hand and went ...
(demonstrating the blow) SMASH!''
   Scannapieco said the slap was ``enough to bring tears to your
eyes,'' but ``she didn't show any reaction whatsoever'' except to
open her eyes and look at Steinberg.
   Scannapieco said Steinberg told him he hit the child because she
sometimes slowed her heart and her breathing, putting herself into a
near coma.
   Earlier Monday, Scannapieco's brother-in-law, Glen Koncelik of
New Baltimore, N.Y., testified he saw Steinberg drop Lisa about
three feet to the ground, telling her, ``You're heavy.''
   Koncelik, a supervisor in a sheet metal factory in Coxsackie,
said the incident was Oct. 24, 1987, in his grassy backyard. He said
Lisa was unhurt.
   Lisa was removed unconscious from Steinberg's apartment in New
York City on Nov. 2, 1987. She died three days later at St.
Vincent's Hospital of head injuries, according to testimony.

<HEAD>Agency Says The Blind Need Not Apply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, after a decade of
accepting foreign service job applications from blind people, has
ruled that diplomacy is not a suitable profession for them.
   The decision was a disappointment to Avraham Rabby, who has
passed five State Department entrance examinations since 1985 and
has other credentials that normally would make him an ideal
candidate for a diplomatic career.
   ``I am absolutely outraged,'' Rabby said in a telephone interview
after the State Department informed him that blind people no longer
will be permitted to take entrance examinations in Braille or to use
outside help.
   ``It is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government
has shown itself to be able to employ blind people constructively,''
Rabby said. ``The State Department is still in the 19th century.''
   Rabby, who lives in New York City, is a graduate of Oxford
University in England with degrees in Spanish and French and has a
master's degree in business administration from the University of
Chicago.
   Born in what is now Israel 46 years ago, he has been blind since
age 8. He lived for 15 years in England and six months each in
France and Spain and he speaks with the elegantly phrased
formulations of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits. He has
his own consulting business, helping disabled people find employment.
   State Department officials agree that they had been following a
contradictory policy toward the blind, allowing them to take the
written and oral examinations but never accepting them as foreign
service officers.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said a department task
force ruled recently that blind candidates must demonstrate an
ability to work with original documents ``effectively and
independently.''
   That meant Rabby would not be provided with any materials in
Braille for an admissions test, that a reader would not be provided
for him and he could not bring his own reader with him.
   Rabby had been taking _ and passing _ State Department written
and oral examinations since December 1985. He said his score on his
written tests had improved each time. He was informed of the rule
change earlier this month shortly before he was to take another
``oral assessment'' test.
   The officials said the policy of rejecting blind applicants after
allowing them to take admission tests was not as cynical as it might
seem.
   They said blind applicants were routinely advised that permission
for them to take admission tests did not mean that medical standards
requiring ``visual acuity'' for all diplomats would be relaxed.
   The State Department view is that all foreign service officers
must be ``worldwide available'' and that a blind person cannot be
expected to deal with the myriad demands diplomats face.
   One official said the United States has facilities for helping
the blind overcome their handicap but that most foreign countries
lack such accommodations.
   Another said that much of diplomacy involves reading the ``body
language'' of foreign envoys during diplomatic discussions. Such
gestures as winks and nods form part of the overall message a
diplomat must assimilate, the official said.
   Rabby said the blind are no less able than sighted people to read
other people's language, be it ``silent or verbal.''
   Accepting a blind person for diplomatic service ``would be a
terribly unfair thing to do to that individual,'' said another
official, who cited high risk posts, such as Lebanon, as
particularly inappropriate for a sightless person.
   The State Department officials commented only on condition their
names not be used.
   Kenneth Jernigan, executive director of the National Federation
of the Blind, has little patience with such arguments.
   ``Everybody says it's wonderful what blind people can do so long
as they work somewhere else,'' Jernigan said from his office in
Baltimore.
   He said dealing with reading material is the principal activity
of diplomats and blind people are capable of handling ``mountains of
paperwork.'' Beyond that, he said, the blind require no more
secretarial help than sighted persons.
   Jernigan added that the federation is prepared to take the State
Department to court but he hopes that course can be avoided.
   James Gashel, director of government affairs for the federation,
said federal law requires that all government and
government-assisted programs conduct their employment practices
without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The blind and other
disabled persons, he said, must be provided with ``reasonable
accommodation'' to help them overcome their handicap.
   But, he said, the State Department wants a general exemption from
this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats
must work.
   He said the last time a blind person threatened court action
against the State Department on the basis of discrimination, the
agency decided on an out of court settlement worth $165,000 to the
complainant.
   His account could not be confirmed by State Department officials.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Incentives To Hold On To Military Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, struggling to keep military
doctors from quitting for better money elsewhere, soon will
establish a hefty bonus system under which some surgeons could earn
$112,250 a year while in uniform.
   Under the program, which takes effect Jan. 1, physicians with
critical skills now in short supply _ such as surgeons _ can boost
their salaries by up to $20,000 a year if they agree to re-enlist
for four years.
   Smaller ``retention bonuses'' will be paid to physicians who
re-enlist for two or three years.
   A surgeon who signs up for another four-year hitch under the
program would see his total monetary compensation rise from roughly
$92,250 a year to $112,250 a year.
   ``The Department of Defense and the Congress believe we have
spotted a problem here in time to do something about it,'' says
David Newhall, the No. 2 executive in the Pentagon's health affairs
office. ``There are other severe non-salary problems that contribute
to the loss of military physicians, but this is a key start.''
   Congress authorized the new bonus program in the Pentagon's
fiscal 1989 budget authorization and earmarked $30 million for the
effort as long as the Defense Department meets certain requirements.
   The most important was a report to Congress by Nov. 15 comparing
military and civilian salaries along with a plan for divvying up the
money among different types of physicians.
   Another report focusing on military health professionals other
than doctors is due by Dec. 1.
   Newhall said the Pentagon met the Nov. 15 deadline for the first
report and will meet the deadline for the second. The Pentagon
official declined to release the first report, but a copy of the
25-page document was obtained by The Associated Press from other
sources.
   The report concluded that the new bonus program authorized by
Congress is desperately needed because the last major overhaul of
military physician salaries occurred in 1980.
   During the intervening years, it said, inflation has totaled 35
percent and the net income of civilian doctors has climbed 47
percent. In some specialties, such as heart surgery, the difference
between military and civilian pay now exceeds 100 percent.
   ``The result is a general loss of buying power for all military
physicians, and a significant loss of competitive compensation for
certain highly paid specialists,'' the report states.
   The report said that while losses of experienced physicians were
widespread, the most critical shortages were among doctors with
specialty skills.
   ``The lure of readily attainable, significantly higher pay is an
attractive incentive for military physicians to leave the service at
the completion of their obligated service,'' the report said. ``In a
12-month period commencing in 1987, the Navy lost 76 percent of its
trained specialists completing their initial training obligation.''
   The Pentagon said it would use the money authorized by Congress
to pay annual bonuses ranging from $20,000 down to $1,500 in
exchange for re-enlistment contracts.
   The various medical specialties have been divided into seven
groups for calculating the bonuses, based on where ``the Defense
Department is suffering the worst shortages,'' the report said.
   The top group includes only two specialties: surgery and
orthopedics. The second tier will include anesthesiology,
ophthalmology, otolaryngology and urology. The third group covers
radiology and obstetrics-gynecology.

   The near-collapse of Israel's largest industrial
conglomerate, owned by the Histadrut labor federation, has forced a
rethinking of the pioneering socialism on which the nation's economy
was built.
   Koor Industries, with annual sales of more than $2 billion,
controls 150 firms and employs 27,000 people making products ranging
from high-technology electronics to tires, fruit juice and
refrigerators.
   Koor lost $250 million last year. In October, it defaulted on a
$20 million loan from New York Bankers Trust Co., and the bank
demanded its liquidation.
   Like the successful plan by Chrysler Corp. in the United States,
Koor is trying to stave off bankruptcy with a government bailout and
a court-backed reorganization plan.
   But Koor's problems are symptomatic of the growing financial ills
that have afflicted Israel's economy.
   Even the kibbutzim, the communal farms that were the backbone of
Israel's pioneering ideal of sharing work and profits, are in
serious financial trouble. The Kibbutz Industries Association
announced last week that its members were struggling to pay off $4
billion in debt.
   The economic shakes have prompted increasing calls for a more
capitalistic, free enterprise system.
   ``The economy has suffocated,'' Stef Wertheimer, a wealthy
businessman, wrote in the Jerusalem Post.
   Israel's tradition of ``work as a source of employment rather
than a source of profits'' has failed, Wertheimer wrote. ``The only
way to save Koor is to turn it into a private enterprise.''
   Even Shimon Peres, leader of the left-leaning Labor Party, which
controls the Histadrut and founded the socialized economy, says he
favors selling off some state-owned companies.
   The Histadrut and state-owned companies account for up to 40
percent of Israel's $35 billion gross domestic product, economic
analysts say.
   Reducing such concentration could take years, said Zeev Refua,
director of the Israel Government Companies Authority, which
oversees the state-owned firms. The authority has launched a program
to ``privatize'' many state enterprises within five years.
   Israel's socialized economy began even before the state was
formed in 1948.
   Jewish immigrants, most from Eastern Europe where Marxist
philosophy was taking hold, arrived early this century with the idea
that collectively they could build enterprises and recycle profits
to create more jobs.
   They started in construction, and their early cooperatives grew
into Solel Boneh, now the nation's largest contracting firm.
   ``Histadrut did start as a trade union, but with no state it soon
became apparent that it had to create employers to create jobs,''
said Efran Kleiman, an economics professor at Hebrew University.
   The Histadrut, which has 2.5 million members in the nation of 4.2
million, represents 80 percent of the labor force. It employs
160,000 people in its companies.
   When the state was founded, extensive government involvement was
needed to build roads, water systems and other infrastructure.
   ``It was necessary to build a country,'' Kleiman said.
   The first steps toward more free enterprise came in 1977, when
the right-wing Likud Party came to power and passed reforms that
dismantled exchange rate controls and removed some trade barriers.
   But high inflation in the mid-1980s forced Likud, with Labor's
backing, to reimpose financial restraints.
   Economists argue that some of the crisis today is a result of a
program that began in 1985 to stabilize the economy.
   The program has squeezed profits by raising interest rates and
other production costs while freezing the exchange rate at 1.6 new
shekels to the dollar.
   Most, however, acknowledge inefficiency and mismanagement.
   ``We feel that if there is no reason the government needs to own
something, it should go,'' said Refua.
   The government reduced its corporate holdings this year with the
sale of its Paz Oil Co. for $97 million. Stock has been sold in
three other companies, and a study sets out a five-year plan to sell
or reduce ownership in 24 other firms.
   If carried through, the government will control enterprises
responsible for just 15 percent of current production by state
companies, Refua said.
   According to the Koor court reorganization plan, the conglomerate
can become profitable again only with extensive pruning. It has
proposed selling $130 million in assets and dismissing 6,000
employees through 1990.
   Such moves are unprecedented in a country where workers believe
they have a right to a job and unemployment has been held to about 6
percent despite recent economic austerity.
   But Histadrut economist Roby Nathanson said it must be done.
   ``Even if these difficult steps are not in accordance with the
historical and philosophical ideas of Histadrut, we have to try and
save the healthy parts,'' Nathanson said. ``If we don't do it, we
take the risk of losing everything.''

   When the 55 Democratic senators meet Tuesday to
select a new leader, one of the things they'll be looking to improve
is the supposedly poor ``quality of life'' in the U.S. Senate.
   Don't count on it, says the outgoing majority leader, Robert C.
Byrd of West Virginia.
   Addressing complaints from some senators that, under his
leadership, the Senate met too often and too long into the night,
Byrd responded:
   ``I believe first in the quality of work. We can't operate on a
punch-the-clock basis. I did that once when I was a welder in a
shipyard.''
   At age 71, Byrd is winding up 12 years as a leader of Senate
Democrats, including six years as majority leader. His replacement
will be elected in a secret vote by the 55 Democratic senators who
will take their place in the 101st Congress next January.
   Senators being courted for their votes often tell the three
candidates they want a leader who will improve the quality of life
in the Senate. By that, they mean fewer long evening sessions and
erratic schedules that often keep younger men away from their
families and Western state senators away from their home bases.
   ``A majority leader doesn't have many options,'' Byrd said in a
recent interview. ``He has the responsibility to get a legislative
program in action and to meet the needs of the nation. One can't
adjust the needs of the nation to one's comfort.''
   Byrd, displaying a 1988 Senate calendar, said the Senate met for
137 days this year. ``That's a quality of life that's not too bad. I
don't know how much one can improve on that,'' he said.
   The three who would try are Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana and George Mitchell of Maine.
   There's no predicting how the voting will go in the secret
balloting.
   ``I think no one, candidates included, has the faintest idea
who's winning,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., who has previously
spoken of the need to improve the ``quality of life.''
   Inouye is the oldest and most experienced Senate candidate. At
age 64, he has served in the Senate since 1962, on the Watergate
committee during the collapse of the Nixon administration and most
recently as co-chairman of the Iran-Contra investigating committee.
   Johnston, 56 and a three-term senator, has been pushing hard for
the job for years and tried briefly to unseat Byrd in 1986. Since
Election Day, he's achieved near frequent-flyer status, making the
rounds of television news shows to demonstrate his ability to speak
for the party.
   Mitchell, 55, a former federal judge with eight years in the
Senate, also is regarded as a strong candidate among those senators
looking for a new spokesman for the Democratic Party, which now has
House Speaker Jim Wright at the top despite ongoing ethics
investigations into his financial dealings.
   The balloting Tuesday will be held in a locked room in the
Capitol. A simple majority is needed to win, and if no one can claim
that after the first ballot, the one with the least votes drops out
and the voting begins anew.
   Republicans also will be electing their leader Tuesday, but Bob
Dole of Kansas has no opposition and is almost certain to return for
his third two-year term as GOP leader.

<HEAD>Bush Urged To Let States Take Lead On Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush should reduce the
federal role in public education and let states take the lead
because ``states can best respond to the unique needs of their
citizens,'' a conservative group says.
   The Heritage Foundation, in a book to be released next month,
said Bush could increase state responsibility for education by
``removing federal oversight authority from federal money for
specific programs, and instead, giving solid amounts of money to
states to distribute as they see fit.''
   The conservative think tank said federal strings ``need to be
detached to restore parental authority and involvement to the
nation's public schools.'' It recommended that parents be given a
choice as to where their students go to school.
   ``By stimulating competition, schools will be immediately forced
to improve or suffer the consequences,'' the report said. ``Vouchers
and tuition tax credits empower the parent, as do state and
community-sponsored open enrollment plans for public schools of
choice.''
   The recommendations, written by C. Ronald Kimberling, a former
assistant secretary of education, are contained in a chapter of the
book ``Mandate for Leadership III: Policy Strategies for the 1980s.''
   The book, copies of which have been distributed to the Bush
transition team, is the third in a series of policy guides published
by the Heritage Foundation. The first, published after President
Reagan was elected in 1980, was considered a blueprint for the
Reagan administration.
   In the chapter on education in the latest book, Kimberling said
Bush should urge Congress to create tax-free savings accounts to
help low-and middle-income families meet future college costs, and
allow tax deductions for businesses that pay their employees'
college tuition to improve U.S. competitiveness.
   Ultimately, the new savings accounts might reduce demand for
direct federal student aid and ``significantly increase the pool of
private savings,'' he said.
   Kimberling also urged the Bush administration to consolidate all
federal education programs, currently spread throughout several
agencies, within the Education Department and to give the education
secretary ``more authority for planning and coordinating education
programs throughout government.''
   The secretary should use his position as the top education
policymaker to ``bring to light problems and solutions for education
reform,'' and use its resources to help states and communities
improve education programs, he said.
   The book says the biggest education policy disappointment of the
Reagan administration ``was its failure to keep or even seriously
pursue its election campaign vow to abolish the (Education)
Department.''

   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, which
has ruled Mexico for almost 60 years, is fighting to retain its grip
even as its presidential candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
prepares to be sworn in.
   To overcome public discontent, internal party divisions and newly
aggressive opposition, Salinas will have to strike quickly on both
the economic and political fronts after he takes office Thursday.
   ``The PRI is in a battle to modernize the country ... and
itself,'' said Juan Enriquez, the party's international
communications director.
   The PRI, as it is known for its Spanish initials, has ruled with
few challenges since its founding in 1929, interlocked with the
government in a system that allowed its tentacles to reach every
nook and cranny of society. It turned out the vote and channeled
favors, including high-level jobs, and in many places succumbed to
corruption.
   It also brought decades of stability and expansion to Mexico, but
its power has been shaken by a continuing economic crisis that has
cut the average Mexican's earning power by 50 percent since 1980.
Salinas scraped by in the July 6 presidential election with just
over 50 percent of the vote.
   ``In the past 48 years there has not been a transfer of the
federal executive power in a political crisis like this,'' wrote
Rodolfo Gonzalez Guevara, leader of a reform movement within the
party, in a recent front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior.
   Still, the party remains powerful, taking sweeping victories in
municipal elections in several provinces since October. Despite
accusations of fraud most of the wins are recognized as genuine.
   For almost 60 years the PRI's pillars _ labor, peasants and a
catchall of bureaucrats, teachers and others _ have wheeled and
dealed, sharing leadership, power and the rewards of power.
   ``The PRI was a type of cushion between the political power and
the citizens,'' said Raul Trejo, a professor at the National
University's Social Research Institute and a labor specialist.
   Election victories were taken for granted and ensured, if an
opposition candidate or apathy stood in the way, by fraud and
campaigns that could depend on access to state funds, vehicles and
employees.
   With transition from a largely illiterate rural population to an
urban society came a political awakening, a desire for more
competitive elections and an end to corruption. In response, PRI
governments gave more opportunities, including congressional seats,
to the small opposition parties.
   Adding to the discontent was the jolt of an economic crisis
brought on by the oil boom and bust. Outgoing President Miguel de la
Madrid's six-year term has been a period of austerity for most
Mexicans.
   On July 6, the PRI was stung with its narrowest federal election
win ever, setting three firsts.
   Salinas won with a scant 50.36 percent of the vote, the first
time the party got less than 70 percent of the vote. It gave up
Senate seats, four of the 64, for the first time. And it had to
settle for 260 of the 500 seats in the lower house, the first time
it failed to gain a two-thirds majority needed for constitutional
reforms.
   The opposition _ both the conservatives and the left _ charged
electoral fraud and that Salinas' victory wasn't legitimate.
   ``Society changed. It's not the apolitical society of 20 years
ago,'' said Luis Javier Garrido, who has written one history of the
party and is working on another.
   Many opponents were former PRI members, such as leftist
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who felt they'd been
dealt out of the circle of power during de la Madrid's conservative
administration, which introduced free market economic policies and
attempted to reduce government subsidies.
   Salinas, who will be the 13th consecutive PRI president, has
pledged greater democracy and changes to make the party more
responsive to the needs of the people.
   ``Our purpose is to modernize so as to retain our majority
position, and so as not to be weakened and exhausted by
parliamentary coalitions, which always end up by succumbing to the
rule of the minorities,'' he said in a campaign speech.
   Even the attempt to open up the party meets tough opposition from
what are known as the party's ``dinosaurs,'' the still-powerful old
guard.
   Labor, traditionally the sector that could be relied upon to get
out the vote and maintain stability, in part in exchange for public
offices, is a foundation of that old guard.
   Before the economic crisis, ``unions could negotiate more or less
satisfactory salaries'' because they were part of the system, Trejo
said. But now, he said, ``there isn't enough for more salaries or to
maintain employment levels. It means there are more protests.''
   More than 20 labor candidates lost in the July 6 election. Recent
violent incidents, including a shootout between rival unions in the
lobby of one of the city's most luxurious hotels, showed either
defiance of de la Madrid and Salinas or loss of control by top labor
bosses, analysts said.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the past decade, seven South American
nations pried themselves loose from the dictatorial grip of military
men.
   The march of freedom seemed inexorable.
   For the 210 million people in the seven nations _ Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Suriname _ the return of
elected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom and
the restoration of human rights.
   Now the bright, shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished.
   Growing disenchantment is evident in several countries, mostly
because of dashed expectations that an end to political repression
would bring economic improvement. It hasn't proved that simple.
   Nonetheless, democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure,
spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule.
   Chile's citizenry, rallying behind the slogan ``the joy is
coming,'' voted to end Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 15-year tenure as
president and hold elections in December, 1989.
   Only tiny Paraguay, run by aging, authoritarian Alfredo
Stroessner since 1954, remains totally outside the democratic fold.
   And despite the occasional rattling of sabers, and a few dramatic
but isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries, few
observers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent.
   ``When you have inflation of 1,000 percent a year, you obviously
get unhappy people, but that doesn't mean they're inviting a return
to military rule,'' said Paul Sigmund, a politics professor at
Princton University and an expert on the Latin American armed forces.
   ``The military doesn't have a solution to these problems,'' he
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``In the
1960s they thought they had the answers. They don't think they do
today.
   ``The notion that somehow they could do it better has been
disproved by their own experience.''
   In most South American countries economic mismanagement or
corruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributed
to the return of civilian rule. But some of the new civilian
governments have not proven much more adept at handling the
continent's most urgent, and persistent, problem: grinding poverty.
   Peru is considered the most volatile example. The inflation rate
is expected to surpass 1,000 percent, the economy is stagnant and
little if any headway has been made in improving the plight of a
hungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a Maoist guerrilla
organization, the Shining Path.
   President Alan Garcia was considered one of Peru's new generation
of charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985. But his
popularity has plummeted because of what critics see as a
vacillating economic policy, especially since he alienated
conservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalize
foreign banks in 1987.
   A recent survey by a Lima-based polling firm, Datum, found that
60 percent of Peruvians don't believe a military coup is likely
before Garica's term ends in 1990. But 28 percent do _ a sign that
democracy's foundations are less than rock-solid.
   ``If our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutions
continue demonstrating ineffectiveness, the totalitarian temptation
will visit us sooner or later,'' said a Peruvian political analyst,
Luis Pasara.
   Brazil and Argentina also are plagued by economic and social
instability, with sky-high inflation rates and tens of thousands of
workers striking daily for better pay, paralyzing many basic
services such as transportation and the mail.
   Brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of government
corruption, nepotism and waste. Retired Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the
last in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985,
told citizens to ``forget me'' when he handed over power to a
civilian. Now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him to
return to office.
   A popular bumper sticker in bustling Rio de Janeiro wistfully
recalls military rule: ``I was happy and I didn't know it.''
   President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, another charismatic symbol
of democracy's return when he assumed office in 1983, was shouted
down by hecklers during a recent speech and his Radical Party trails
the Peronist Movement in popularity as the nation prepares for
elections in May.
   But such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflect
perhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the new
democracies. Freedom of expression and action has been a pledge kept
by the new governments.
   Most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass media
suffers few if any restrictions. The systematic arrest, torture and
killing of dissidents that took place when troops kept order under
military rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and human
rights.

   Participation in party politics, labor federations and other
social groups both pro- and anti-government is active and
broad-based across the continent. The problem, according to some
analysts, is that such groups often work at cross-purposes.
   ``The primary problem in South America's democratic
reconstruction is the capacity to stabilize the political system,''
said the Chilean political scientist Juan Somavia. ``And the
capacity to stabilize the political system depends on achieving
basic accords among political parties and the different social
sectors.''
   Until a country achieves a working, stable political system ``the
possibility of a coup will remain present,'' said Somavia. He is
president of a Latin American study group sponsored by the Academy
of Christian Humanism.
   Somavia cited Uruguay as an example of a new democracy where
``political arrangement is basically working.'' Under Julio
Sanguinetti, who took office in 1985 and is considered one of the
most widely respected new presidents, Uruguay's political, labor and
business groups have reached a basic understanding that has provided
stability and economic improvement.
   Bolivia also is often cited as a democratic success story.
President Victor Paz Estenssoro has overseen an economic austerity
program that slashed annual inflation from an astounding 20,000
percent to about 10 percent.
   The Bolivian reforms were painful and politically risky, with
thousands of workers at unprofitable state-run mines laid off and
new taxes imposed. But the government's predictions of stability and
growth are slowly coming true and, as Bolivians prepare for new
presidential elections in May, no one considers a coup even remotely
possible in what traditionally has been South America's most
political unstable country.
   Not that the military hasn't made its presence felt. Paz
Estenssoro's predecessor, Hernan Siles Suazo, was kidnapped by
police and military officers in 1984 but freed hours later because
of a vast public and official outcry.
   In Ecuador, Gen. Frank Vargas Pazzos of the air force led two
short-lived revolts in 1986 before the government arrested him. A
year later, his followers abducted President Leon Febres Cordero and
held him for 11 hours, freeing him only after an amnesty was granted
to the rebellious Vargas Pazzos.
   Two brief but dramatic garrison revolts in Argentina, in 1987 and
1988, were defused when President Alfonsin agreed to limit human
rights trials of soldiers.
   In each crisis, it is widely accepted that the civilian
governments emerged strengthened.
   And although military rumblings persist, experts contend there is
a new, less threatening tenor.
   ``The saber-rattling is now related to issues that directly
affect the armed forces as an institution,'' such as human rights
trials and military spending, said Sigmund. He said they no longer
are taking public issue with general government policy, or
presenting themselves in the role of national saviors as they did in
the 1960s.
   Sigmund said he does not subscribe to the notion of an inevitable
political cycle of military and civilian rule.
   ``The pendulum has stopped swinging,'' he said.
   According to Somavia, the military also lacks the broad-based
civilian support for a takeover they enjoyed during the social
turmoil that affected many South American countries two decades ago.
   ``They have less social force,'' he said. ``No one is asking for
a coup.''
   But Somavia called the antagonistic relations between the
military and civilians ``a central problem that is going to be with
us for a very long time.'' Re-establishing a constructive
relationship in which the armed forces fully accept civilian control
``is something you can't accomplish in one government.''

   A monthlong spate of incidents involving U.S.
military forces has touched a raw nerve in Japan, provoking outraged
newspaper editorials and a sharp protest from the government.
   On Okinawa, the southern island where 35,000 U.S. troops jostle
for training space with 1.2 million Japanese residents, civilians
complain that houses were hit by bullets in October and two tear-gas
canisters exploded at a nightclub Nov. 19. The canisters sent scores
of people into the street, coughing and choking.
   The tear-gas incident, which U.S. Marine Corps authorities said
was under investigation, came one day after the abrupt transfer of a
U.S. Navy skipper. His ship had embarrassed the Navy command by
firing practice shells that hit about 1,000 feet from a Japanese
coast guard vessel.
   The Navy immediately expressed regret for the shelling, which
occurred in Japanese waters near the entrance to Tokyo Bay on Nov.
9, but the Japanese government reacted strongly.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with the U.S. Embassy,
while several major newspapers published blistering editorials.
   The Mainichi Shimbun daily called the shelling ``the result of
the unbelievably slack discipline and lack of moral concepts of the
U.S. forces in Japan.''
   Said the Asahi Shimbun: ``It would definitely be risky if things
of this sort were left as they are. Even a single miscalculation
would endanger human life. Besides, it would gravely affect the ties
of genuine friendship that exist between the United States and
Japan.''
   About 64,000 U.S. troops are in Japan under a security treaty
that obliges the United States to help defend this country, with an
added major role in security for northeast Asia. The treaty also
obliges Japan to provide the bases and training areas needed by the
U.S. forces.
   The vast majority of the Japanese support the U.S.-Japan security
treaty and the country's anti-war constitution, which give the
United States a prime role in defending Japan.
   But this country never was occupied by foreign troops until its
defeat in World War II, and Japanese are sensitive to the U.S.
presence.
   Leftists demonstrate against visiting U.S. ships that may be
carrying nuclear arms, and the public reacts strongly when a
dangerous accident involves U.S. forces or when the bases appear to
be encroaching on Japanese life.
   The U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka wants to build more than 800
apartments but faces resistance from the neighboring town of Zushi,
which has repeatedly elected a mayor who opposes taking forest land
for the military housing.
   On Okinawa, prefectural Gov. Junji Nishime has blamed a string of
troubles on ``something wanting in the U.S. military's chain of
command or a decline of discipline.''
   U.S. commanders on the southern island are reportedly reviewing
safety measures following a forest fire that occurred in a training
area in October and the discovery about the same time that a
residential area near a Marine Corps firing range had been hit by
bullets even though firing on the range is supposed to be in the
opposite direction.
   Two Foreign Ministry officials went to Okinawa on Thursday to
meet with U.S. generals, inspect the firing ranges and talk to local
officials.
   Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said the local people's
attitude was a ``crucial element in the presence of the bases'' and
was important to the wider issue of U.S.-Japan security relations.
   Okinawans also have asked that some land now in U.S. bases be
returned to civilian use for the growth of the island's tourist
industry. About 20 percent of the island's 300,350 acres is
controlled by U.S. forces.
   An Okinawa official who requested anonymity said there were
numerous small annoyances like parachutists landing by accident in
someone's backyard or losing equipment that plummets to the ground.
   ``Things may not be completely improved in a day or two, but we
understand that the U.S. military is at least trying,'' the official
said in a telephone interview.
   The Foreign Ministry commended the Navy for relieving Cmdr.
Frederick H. Michaelis Jr. as captain of the guided missile
destroyer USS Towers, which fired practice shells in Japanese
waters. But the ministry spokesman said Japan was still awaiting a
full report from the U.S. government.
   The U.S. command said it was reviewing its investigation of the
Towers incident and would not comment until the review was finished.
Pending the review, Michaelis was reassigned to shore duty at the
Yokosuka base.

   Federico Fley prays for the soul of
his lost son, a Sandinista army officer killed in a rebel ambush,
and for the health of another, a leader in the same rebel fight to
oust the leftist government.
   ``I pray to God he will leave the Contras,'' Fley said of his son
Luis, known in the rebel ranks as Commandante Johnson. ``He was a
good boy. But it's difficult. One son is dead and the other is
away.''
   The divisions in the Fley family are common in Nicaragua, site of
a 7-year-old civil war that has pitted brothers against brothers on
the battlefield.
   Hundreds of thousands of people have fled, leaving behind loved
ones, for reasons varying from repression to opposition to the
10-year-old leftist government.
   Fley, 83, and his wife, Teodora, 68, raised 14 children in
Matagalpa, a north-central mountain city. In addition to Enrique,
who was killed, and Luis, with the Contras, two are officers with
the Sandinista army.
   Enrique died last year at age 30 when rebels attacked the truck
he was riding. Luis, 37, once a staunch Sandinista supporter, left
Nicaragua almost eight years ago to join the Contras.
   They are not alone.
   Christiana Chamorro runs the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
while her sister Claudia Chamorro is the Sandinista ambassador to
Costa Rica.
   Brother Carlos Fernando Chamorro edits the official Sandinista
newspaper, Barricada; their other brother, Pedro Joaquin, supports
the Contras.
   The Defense Ministry spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, is the
sister of Marta Sacasa, who until recently was a Contra spokeswoman.
   Finance Minister Luis Carrion, one of nine members of the
Sandinista Directorate, is a nephew of Arturo Cruz, a former Contra
Directorate member.
   The Fleys are deeply religious rural folk, retired farmers who
typify the majority of Nicaraguans divided between the
U.S.-supported Contras and the Soviet-backed Sandinistas.
   ``One of our sons died because of the war and another is away. We
can't solve this,'' said Mrs. Fley, sitting on a rocker in her
sparsely decorated home.
   Mrs. Fley hasn't seen her son Luis since he left in 1981. She
spoke with him by telephone after Enrique died last January.
   ``He called me to offer his condolences,'' she said.
   Her son Luis, interviewed in a Honduran rebel camp three months
earlier, remembered that phone call well.
   ``My mother told me to come home, that she didn't want to see
another son killed,'' the rebel commander said. ``I told her I was
away from all that. I meant that I was away from the battlefield. I
later found out (Sandinista Intelligence Chief) Ricardo Wheelock
told people I had left the Contras. The phone was tapped.''
   Mrs. Fley said she resisted Sandinista requests that she write or
phone her son to plead for his return.
   Her husband, his white hair tucked beneath a faded blue cap,
recalled why Luis left.
   ``He sold coffee at a low price, so the other salesmen said he
was selling to the Contras. That's a lie. They were going to kill
him,'' Fley said. ``He knew it was better to leave.''
   The 37-year-old rebel commander, interviewed at the Contra camp
in August, said he had questioned the freedom and equality promised
by the Sandinistas, and was put in prison in 1981.
   ``Why did they have everything and we, in the rural regions,
still had nothing? I took the rifle I used to fight against Somoza
and fought against the Sandinistas, '' he said.
   ``I'd like to go back to my country,'' he said.
   When told that her son had recently been seen at a rebel camp in
Honduras, Mrs. Fley gasped. ``If you see him, please tell him we are
well ... old, poor, but well,'' she said.
   Sitting in the same small room was Maribel Rodriguez Mercado, the
widow of the slain Enrique. She has never met her brother-in-law.
   ``In the beginning, I blamed Luis personally for killing him,''
she sid. ``But I also have brothers with the Contras ... We don't
talk about it much here. What can we say?''

<TEXT>
   Marian Welch, who edited two publications
for the ultraconservative John Birch Society, which her husband
helped found, has died at age 88.
   Mrs. Welch died Tuesday at Glover Memorial Hospital in Needham.
   She was editor of the society's weekly newspapers, The New
American and Review of the News and was a contributing editor of the
society's Conservative Digest.
   She was born in Akron, Ohio, and graduated from Wellesely College
in 1922, studying at the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of
Chicago. The society was founded in 1958 by 12 men, including her
husband, Robert, who has since died. It was named after a young
American missionary who was killed in China in 1954.
   The group is headquartered in Belmont, where the Welches lived
for 40 years.
   The society first gained national attention when it accused
then-President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
of being implicated in a Communist plot to take over the U.S.
government in the 1950s.

   NASA began the countdown early Monday
for launching the space shuttle Atlantis on Thursday with five
astronauts and an intelligence-gathering satellite.
   The clock begin ticking at 12:01 a.m. EST as test director Jerry
Crute issued the traditional ``call to stations'' that summoned more
than 100 controllers to their computer consoles in the launch
control center four miles from the launch pad.
   ``We're pressing on; the countdown has started,'' said George
Diller, a NASA spokesman.
   The call also was a signal for workers at the pad to begin
servicing the main engines and removing work platforms from around
the base of the spaceship.
   Because the mission is classified, the Defense Department and
NASA are disclosing few details of the flight. A brief statement was
issued Sunday describing the preparations completed earlier in the
day with the inspection and closure of the engine compartment.
   U.S. officials are mum on the length of the flight and what the
astronauts will be doing in orbit, but the official Soviet news
agency Tass said Sunday the mission's main task is to put a new
generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse, into
near-Earth orbit.
   ``The satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the
Soviet Union with the help of updated radar,'' Tass said in a report
from Moscow.
   ``The Pentagon plans to deploy in the next few years four other
similar spy satellites which will play the role of an `eye' for the
new strategic bomber B-2, known as stealth,'' the Soviet agency said.
   As for the timing of the launch Thursday, reliable sources have
said that it should take place about 7 a.m. EST if weather and other
conditions are adequate. But officials will say only that launch is
scheduled to occur sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. They say
they will make the time public when the clock reaches the 9-minute
mark.
   A preliminary weather forecast for Thursday was not favorable,
calling for overcast sky, brisk winds and a chance of showers.
   Once Atlantis reaches space, NASA plans only two public
announcements. The first, four hours after launch, will report
briefly on the condition of the spaceship. The second will be a
24-hour advance notice on when the astronauts will land at Edwards
Air Force Base in California.
   The silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops.
   The Pentagon contends the secrecy makes it more difficult for
Soviet satellites and spy ships prowling off Cape Canaveral to
monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the
Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already
know a great deal about the mission and that once Atlantis'
satellite is in its own orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it
precisely and know what it is doing.
   The satellite reportedly will gather extremely sharp radar images
of military targets as it follows a path that will carry it over 80
percent of the Soviet Union.
   The five military astronauts who will fly the mission are
scheduled to arrive here Monday from their training base in Houston
to make final preparations for launch. They are Navy Cmdr. Robert L.
Gibson, the commander; Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the pilot;
and Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L.
Ross and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   The flight will be the 27th for the space shuttle, the third
dedicated totally to the military and the second since the
Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986.
Following the accident, NASA held up flights for 32 months while
management and hardware changes were made.
   Discovery and a five-man crew returned the shuttle to space with
a flight that began Sept. 29.

   Though Clarence Charlton is homeless, he knows he
has a warm and dry place to sleep _ as long as he doesn't mind
waking up several miles away from where he laid his head down.
   Charlton, like hundreds of New York's street people, calls the
city's subway system home, and officials say they expect the numbers
to surge as winter sets in.
   ``I can always get on the subway. I usually have the fare,'' said
Charlton, 78, a former mental patient who was wearing a black-knit
cap, grimy pants, no shirt, a sweater and tweed coat one day last
week. Bedroom slippers failed to cover his swollen feet.
   ``In the daytime I'm out on the bench, and at nighttime I get in
the subway,'' he said, lighting a cigarette butt, which he says
helps his asthma. ``In bad weather, I'll go underground.''
   Charlton had company that day at the 179th Street Station in
Queens. Another homeless man was at the other end of the platform,
and at least eight already were on the E train when it rolled up to
start its run to Manhattan.
   As the winds get colder, New York's subways are drawing ever more
homeless people. The attraction: a warm, relatively safe
environment, all for a dollar. Trains like the E line, whose route
never goes above ground, are particularly popular because they stay
warmer.
   For many riders, the disheveled and often unbathed passengers are
not welcome on the nation's largest transit system.
   ``They stink. They're dirty. They can smell up a whole train,''
said passenger Bernard Nashofer.
   Transit police walk a thin line, rousting homeless people who
cause trouble but letting the others sleep. Maintenance crews find
themselves cleaning the kinds of messes that subways weren't meant
for. Subway passengers learn to select cars by scent.
   In response, the Metropolitan Transit Authority approved a plan
last week to hire the Volunteers of America, a social service group,
to patrol subway platforms and trains. Members plan to talk to the
homeless and offer them the group's shelter as an alternative to
sleeping underground. But many homeless people shun shelters, saying
they don't feel safe in them.
   Last summer, the transit authority estimated there were 1,400
people using its trains and stations as home. Advocates for the
homeless say that's far too low an estimate, and the authority
admits the number will be much greater this winter.
   The problem is not unique to New York, but mainly is an issue
only in cities where buses and subways run all night. In Los
Angeles, transit officials say, many homeless people, drifters and
alcoholics ride buses from one end of the line to the other all
night long.
   ``Because the homeless situation has increased in the community,
I would expect public transit would get its share,'' said Leilia
Bailey, transit director of the Southern California Rapid Transit
District.
   There is no policy against riding the buses over and over as long
as people pay the fares, she said. New York's transit system also
has no such ban.
   On a Manhattan-bound E train at midnight one day last week, at
least 18 homeless men and one woman were sleeping. Among them was a
gray-haired man with a cane and a man face down over four seats, his
right foot in a cast and his crutches under the seats.
   An Asian man with few teeth in his mouth and few English words in
his vocabulary wrapped paper napkins around a bleeding hand. ``I
hit,'' he explained. Another man had his head wrapped in a black
scarf, topped by a fake-fur cap and a hard hat. Three large
suitcases surrounded him.
   ``It's like a hotel on wheels,'' said Robert Torres, a
27-year-old platform conductor.
   ``Eight years ago, you'd see one or two in the whole train. Now
you'll see six or seven in one car,'' he said.
   Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, a lawyer who is on the transit
authority board of directors, said the transit police must exercise
more authority over the homeless.
   ``If they've paid their dollar they have a right, providing they
comport themselves with dignity,'' he said. ``But if they take up
several seats, urinate, defecate, then they should be removed.''
   But Transit Police Chief Vincent Del Castillo, noting that
``homelessness is not a crime,'' said criminals and fare-beaters
take precedence among his force of 3,800.
   One homeless man said he had little choice but to use the transit
system as his home.
   ``There's no other place you can stay in the winter,'' said Ray
Smith, 31. ``It's safer in the street than it is in the shelter.
This is one of the few places where you can live in harmony. And
it's clean.''

<TEXT>
   Economists predict that Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, just like President-elect George Bush, will have a short
honeymoon unless his new government can bring down the budget
deficit.
   Concern about the deficit is troubling forecasters in both
countries despite the Canadian economists' general optimism produced
by the favorable election outcome for the Canada-U.S. free trade
agreement.
   The Canadian dollar strengthened once election uncertainty was
out of the way but prices declined on the Toronto stock exchange for
two days after the Nov. 21 balloting.
   ``I think it's a similar situation to what happened in the United
States,'' Patty Croft, economist for Burns, Fry, Ltd., said. ``The
overriding concern is the budget deficit.''
   The election gave the Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party
its second consecutive majority government and cleared the way for
final parliamentary approval of the trade agreement. The pact,
already ratified by Washington, would eliminate most trade barriers
between the two countries.
   The agreement's benefits, however, are expected to be most
visible over the long term.
   Economists say a Canadian decision to back away from the
agreement scheduled to start taking effect Jan. 1 would have
negative repercussions, but positive impact will be less easy to
spot in the short term.
   Business expansion in Canada, as in the United States, has lasted
for six years and the debt per capita in Canada is higher than in
the United States, raising fears of higher inflation and a possible
recession.
   During Mulroney's first term, Canada's government deficit fell
from a record $31.8 billion in the 1984-85 fiscal year to an
estimated $24 billion for 1988-89.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson has said it will be reduced
further to $23.7 billion next year, although economists caution it
could go higher if interest rates increase more than the government
planned and growth is lower.
   ``We're in no better shape than they are,'' Marc Meagher of
Merrill Lynch Canada's research department said. He said the markets
in both countries are looking for signs that there are credible
plans to reduce the deficits.
   Croft at Burns, Fry noted that among industrialized countries
only Italy exceeds Canada with a higher rate of deficit to gross
domestic product. The gross domestic product is the value of the
nation's annual output of goods and services, excluding returns from
investments abroad.
   The Scotia Bank's forecasts say real gross domestic product
growth will slow from 4.0 percent last year and 4.3 percent in 1988
to 2.5 percent next year. More dramatically, it predicts business
investment will drop from 8.8 percent in 1987 and a soaring 18.3
percent this year to 6.1 percent in 1989.
   The Ottawa-based, private Conference Board of Canada, which
surveys 14 economists, projected growth of 4.2 percent for 1988
slowing to 2.3 percent next year.
   James Frank, the board's chief economist, said the slowing growth
rate was ``due to the Bank of Canada's policy of high interest
rates, the longevity of the current expansion _ now at 23 quarters _
and a weaker housing industry.''
   Thirteen of the 14 economists surveyed said they expected
inflation and interest rates to increase next year.
   The board found a consensus that the slowdown will not slip into
a mild recession, but Frank said: ``The risk is certainly rising.''
   Inflation is projected to be 4.1 percent this year and increase
to 5.0 percent in 1989.
   The prime minister announced rapidly after his victory that
Wilson will stay on as finance minister.
   ``We know better than to spend the country into recession,''
Mulroney said at a Toronto appearance Thursday night. ``We will
maintain our commitment to gradually reduce the federal deficit. .
.. It won't be easy.''

   Emergency shelters house a growing throng of
homeless Americans, but the need now, in the words of a National
Academy of Sciences study, is for ``a stable residence'' for those
who have none _ in other words, permanent housing. Noting that
federal funds for low-income housing have been cut by more than
three-quarters since 1981, advocates say the need for lasting
shelter is critical. Some see potential in unused government-owned
houses and in the shells of once-sturdy buildings that stand vacant
in inner cities.

   Taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses
standing empty. At the same time, tens of thousands of American
families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the
streets.
   Now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are
being brought together _ in a project that is housing families from
the Minnesota cold, in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a
dwelling in Chicago, in New York City's restoration of entire
tumbledown blocks.
   Activists, while encouraged, are pressing housing officials to do
more, and a major decision could come in federal court next week.
They say the government is skirting a law that pledges available
space to those without homes.
   ``I think thousands of buildings could and should be usable,''
said Robert Hayes, counsel for the National Coalition for the
Homeless in New York, a city that owns, mostly through tax default,
5,000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of
apartments and has an estimated 60,000 homeless people.
   One of the abandoned buildings was on Leggett Street in a sorry
corner of the South Bronx, a national symbol of blight.
   One of the homeless was Susan Thomas, placed in a shabby welfare
hotel room in Manhattan a few years ago with her two sons, then 6
months and 2{ years old, after she split from their father and ended
up on the street.
   ``I used to cry 'cause I didn't want to be there,'' she says.
Their hotel room was broken into, and drug dealing and fear were all
around.
   After 18 months, she boarded a city van for Leggett Street, to
look at an apartment in a building that had been restored.
   ``I wasn't expecting anything like this,'' the 24-year-old woman
said, talking to a reporter in her tidy, bright two-bedroom
apartment, her boys playing across a room that's still mostly bare
of furnishings. It was Ms. Thomas' day off; she's a clerk in a
nearby store.
   Her building, whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning
fluid, had been a ruin not long before.
   Another Bronx site still is _ but not for long. Workers there are
gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block, to create 220
apartments for families like the Thomases.
   Vince Campisi, construction supervisor, outgrowled the demolition
equipment as he described getting started: ``You literally couldn't
get in for the junkies. ... Crack? Vials by the garbage-pailful.''
   Leading a reporter on a tour, Campisi crunched up rubble-strewn
steps to the remains of what? a parlor? Its ceiling was burned
through to the sky. A green upholstered sofa stood upended in a
corner. The windows let in a drizzle. ``No air-conditioning
needed,'' he deadpanned.
   Still, he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have
abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like New
York. The gutting-and-rehab job that Campisi is overseeing is to
cost the city $15 million. How much would comparable new buildings
cost? ``Maybe $50 million,'' he guessed.
   Halfway across the country, in Minnesota, the vacant, publicly
owned houses being readied for the homeless look different.
   In Duluth, a three-bedroom ranch house that had reverted to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development when its owners failed
to make payments on a federally backed loan is being readied for a
family that has been on the streets.
   ``We're offering properties that are in good condition,'' said
Patricia Mack of the HUD office in Minneapolis, which hopes by next
spring to lease 15 houses rent-free to non-profit groups that house
the homeless.
   Such efforts have strong support, according to a survey earlier
this year by the National Housing Institute, a non-profit think tank
based in Orange, N.J. One thousand adults were surveyed by phone.
   Eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for
homeless Americans, who number 450,000 to 3 million, estimated by
the government and advocacy groups, respectively. Sixty percent said
they'd willingly pay an extra $120 apiece in taxes each year to
expand housing efforts.
   ``The need for permanent housing cannot be met,'' says a
September report by the National Coalition for the Homeless, without
an increase in the federal budget for low-income housing _ $7.538
billion this year, down 77 percent from 1981's budget of $32.2
billion.

   Beyond dollar allocations, however, an ``enormous pool of unused
(federal) property,'' in the words of U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch in Washington, is not even being considered for use by the
homeless, despite a year-old law requiring that surplus government
property be made available for them.
   Gasch made that observation in issuing a preliminary injunction
two months ago, stopping HUD, the Veterans Administration and three
other agencies from disposing of federal property that is eligible
for use under the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.
   To Maria Foscarinis, a lawyer representing the National Coalition
in the suit, ``it seemed very peculiar'' that agencies all over the
United States, when pressed to list unused or underused property,
found only 12 parcels and to date have turned over only four to
groups aiding the homeless.
   ``There are literally tens of thousands of pieces of property
across the country. We can't be watchdogs on every one. That's why
we need an aggressive order,'' she said, referring to hopes of a
permanent injunction at a hearing before Gasch on Dec. 5.
   ``The winter is hard upon us,'' the judge said, noting the
urgency of the case in a Nov. 18 hearing on a request for an
updated, complete list of underused property. ``What the court is
fundamentally interested in ... is to make some housing available
for these people.''
   He added, ``I know bureaucrats. ... The thing you've got to do
with bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it that they do the
job.''
   Not included under the McKinney Act's broad mandate are thousands
of houses the federal government owns through default on mortgages
that it guarantees.
   Nevertheless, advocates sought in a separate lawsuit to stop the
sales of those houses until they could be considered for use for the
homeless. They were turned down by Gasch, and an appeal is pending.
   In fiscal 1988, HUD sold 80,164 of these foreclosed homes at an
average price of $38,000.
   Currently, HUD holds more than 45,000 properties, according to
department spokesman Rod Hiduskey, who noted that the sales revenue
goes mainly into a fund that repays lender banks that HUD has
guaranteed against loss.
   HUD officials argue that the fund would be bankrupted by 1990 if
sales were stopped.
   There are federal programs that discount house prices for
homeless-help agencies, like Ms. Mack's in Minnesota and the
agency's Urban Homesteading Program. Hiduskey said 200 federally
owned homes have been sold at 10 percent below market value under
another program for the homeless.
   Advocates say it's not enough.
   ``Homes have been disposed of with agency coffers in mind, and
not national housing goals,'' asserted the report from the National
Coalition for the Homeless. ``By and large, programs to divert parts
of the inventory to aid the homeless are unpromoted and unused.''
   As a result, some advocates have grown more militant.
   Michael Marubio of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless said
that group is secretly rehabilitating an abandoned HUD apartment and
will turn it over to a homeless family.
   ``Later on, we'll have a housewarming party and we'll ask HUD
officials and anyone else who wants to come,'' he said.
   Nor is the federal government the only public landlord of vacant
housing.
   According to checks by The Associated Press, as many as 60,000
vacant or near-vacant dwellings may be in local government hands
because of tax delinquency.
   Besides New York City's roughly 5,000 empty and 4,000 partly
occupied buildings, there are 6,500 in Philadelphia, 3,000 in
Detroit, 1,600 in Washington, D.C., and smaller numbers in Boston,
Denver, Miami and other cities, say housing officials.
   In Chicago's Cook County, 41,000 residential properties have been
declared tax delinquent for more than five years, according to
Barbara Grau of the Chicago Rehab Network, a coalition of non-profit
developers.
   ``If America put its mind to it,'' said Marubio, ``we could house
the homeless.''
   In the last three years, the Boston Public Facilities Department
has turned 12 abandoned buildings, out of 100, into shelters for the
homeless.
   The purchase of 50 houses from the Veterans Administration is
part of a $3.1 million Philadelphia plan to provide 490 units of
permanent housing for the homeless.
   In New York City, ``by 1993, every vacant, city-owned building
that can be rebuilt will be renovated already or in a program to
rebuild,'' said Catie Marshall of the city Department of Housing
Preservation and Development.
   In 1986, Mayor Edward Koch announced a 10-year housing plan,
costing more than $5 billion. But that plan, meant to produce
housing for many income groups, should be redrawn to direct more of
the money toward the homeless, says Andrew Scherer, a lawyer
representing an advocacy group, Housing Justice Campaign, in a suit
against Koch.
   Even so, the plan's provision for rehabilitating old buildings
instead of constructing new ones ``economically ... makes sense,''
Scherer said.
   If those squeezed out of homes because of high prices and other
factors are to be saved from the streets, he said, ``The vacant,
abandoned stock that the city has taken title to is the key.''

   The countdown began today for
Thursday's launch of shuttle Atlantis, which will carry five
astronauts and a secret satellite that reportedly will gather
military intelligence over the Soviet Union.
   The clock began ticking at 12:01 a.m. EST as NASA test director
Jerry Crute issued the traditional ``call to stations'' that
assembled more than 100 controllers at computer consoles in the
launch control center four miles from the launch pad.
   The call also was a signal for workers at the pad to begin
servicing Atlantis' engines and removing work platforms from the
base of the spaceship.
   ``We're pressing on; the countdown has started,'' said George
Diller, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman.
   Because the mission is classified, the Defense Department and
NASA are disclosing few details of the flight, including its length
and what the astronauts will be doing.
   As for the launch time, sources speaking on condition of
anonymity have said it should take place about 7 a.m. EST if weather
and other conditions are adequate. But officials will say only that
launch is scheduled for sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m.
Thursday. They say they will make the time public when the clock
reaches the nine-minute mark.
   A preliminary weather forecast for Thursday called for
unfavorable conditions: overcast sky, brisk winds and possible
showers.
   Atlantis' crew, all military officers, planned to fly here this
afternoon from their training base in Houston to make final
preparations for launch. Instead of making the usual arrival
comments to the news media, they have been advised to say nothing.
   The crew commander is Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson. The pilot is
Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, and the mission specialists are
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force,
and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   After Atlantis reaches orbit, NASA plans only two public
statements. The first, four hours after launch, will report briefly
on the condition of the spaceship. The second will be a 24-hour
advance notice on when the astronauts will land at Edwards Air Force
Base in California.
   The silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops.
   Defense Department officials contend the secrecy makes it more
difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships operating off Cape
Canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the
Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, already know a great
deal about the mission.
   In fact, the official Soviet news agency Tass said Sunday: ``The
main task of the secret mission is to put into near-Earth orbit a
new generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse. The
satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the Soviet
Union with the help of updated radar. The Pentagon plans to deploy
in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will
play the role of an `eye' for the new strategic bomber B-2, known as
stealth.''
   U.S. critics also say that once Atlantis' satellite is in its own
orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what
it is doing.
   Much already has been published about the satellite, based on
reports from sources who say it will gather extremely sharp radar
images of Soviet military targets as it follows a course that covers
80 percent of the Soviet Union.
   The flight will be the 27th for a U.S. space shuttle, the third
dedicated totally to the military and the second since the
Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986.
   The Challenger accident kept the shuttle fleet grounded for 32
months. Discovery and a five-man crew had a successful flight that
began Sept. 29.

<BYLINE>USDA Says Demand Still Up For Rail Cars, River Barges
^By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says that in
the wake of this summer's drought, demand for rail cars and river
barges has kept shipping prices at relatively high levels.
   ``Navigation on the upper Mississippi River has nearly returned
to normal,'' said T.Q. Hutchinson of the department's Economic
Research Service. ``Rain has restored most channels and reservoirs
to navigable depths, although they are still low.''
   The river's carrying capacity was still low going into this
fall's harvest, and barge operating costs are still high. And the
lesser flow forced authorities to limit the number of barges
permitted in a single tow.
   Grain shipments on the Illinois and Mississippi rivers during
July and August averaged 3 million tons per month, down 30 percent
from May _ the month before navigation was impaired _ and 17 percent
below June.
   ``Some of the reduction stemmed from limited barge capacity, but
reduced exports also contributed,'' Hutchinson said in the current
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   According to export inspection figures for June, July and August,
monthly grain exports averaged about 20 percent below May. Shipments
through Mississippi ports dropped 16 percent to 140 million bushels
in June, rose slightly to 144 million in June and then to 148
million in August.
   Barge rates, meanwhile, were up from a year earlier by about 24
percent during the first five months of 1988. In June, as river
problems developed, the rates soared. At Peoria, Ill., rates to New
Orleans averaged $17.44 per ton, compared with $6.37 the week before.
   Hutchinson said the hike was shortlived, although the average for
all of June was $9.86 per ton, up 59 percent from May. By August,
rates were down to $7.61, only 45 cents more than the January-May
average. However, prospects for large corn sales to the Soviet Union
pushed barge rates above $10 again in September.
   In late June, he said, the Burlington Northern railroad announced
a series of increases to achieve ``barge competitive'' rates for
hauling wheat. For shipments to New Orleans, for example, the new
rates would have amounted to an additional $197 per rail car in
August and a further increase of $276 per car in September, a 26
percent increase from June.
   For some destinations, the rates announced by the Burlington
Northern would have driven up rail rates in December to 80 percent
above last June, Hutchinson said.
   ``When announced, the rate hikes appeared likely to prevail
because demand for rail service was record high and the drought had
sharply curtailed barge capacity,'' Hutchinson said. ``Moreover,
other railroads were expected to raise their rates by like amounts.''
   But rates for grain remained nearly level during July and August
as demand for rail services declined sharply, he said. Preliminary
data showed, in fact, that grain rates actually fell slightly in
July and then edged back up in August to their June levels.
   Hutchinson said that Burlington Northern's rail rates for October
and November, based on sales of transportation certificates, may be
up less than 2 percent from August and that they could decline in
December. Certificates are fixed-price contracts for service to be
provided in future months.

   Orville L. Freeman, president of the
Agriculture Council of America, says one of the most important tasks
for the incoming Bush administration should be the formation of a
new Third World policy.
   ``Since World War II, multiple government and private programs
have evolved to deal with economic, political and military
objectives along with a variety of humanitarian and social needs,''
says Freeman, who was secretary of agriculture during the Kennedy
and Johnson administrations of the 1960s.
   Freeman added in a recent council newsletter: ``It is time now
for the United States, in its own self interest, to set forth a new
overall Third World policy and restructure its programs to that
end.''
   The council is a private, non-profit organization based in
Washington. Agricultural trade policy and programs are among its
interests.
   Freeman said the council and many others would like ``to push
agriculture trade and development policy to a high position'' on the
agenda of the Bush administration.
   ``Certainly, if this country is to renew its historic position in
international trade, new attention must be paid to a Third World
that even in the 1980s has accounted for one dollar in every three
in U.S. foreign sales _ 40-plus percent in the case of farm
products,'' he said.

   Global milk production is expected to increase
further in 1989, says the Agriculture Department.
   Milk output rose slightly this year to an estimated 428.2 million
metric tons and could increase to 431.7 million tons in 1989,
according to a report by the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service.
   The production estimates were based on forecasts for 38 selected
countries.
   Production in the 12-nation European Economic Community was
forecast next year at 107 million tons, down fractionally from 107.8
million tons this year. Milk output in the Soviet Union was
indicated at 107.3 million tons, up from 105.5 million in 1988.
   The U.S. output was forecast at 65.3 million tons, down slightly
from 65.5 million tons indicated for this year.

<TEXT>
   Surrealist painter Salvador Dali,
suffering from pneumonia and possible heart failure, was
hospitalized on Sunday, news reports said.
   Carlos Ponsati, Dali's personal physician, said Dali, 84, was in
stable condition at the Hospital Comarcal in Figueras, according to
the official Spanish news agency EFE.
   A spokesman at the hospital declined comment but said the
hospital would make a statement Monday morning, the French news
agency Agence France-Presse reported.
   Dali, who was born in this small Catalonian town in northeastern
Spain near the French border, is known for his scenes of limp
watches draped over troubled landscapes and hundreds of other works
of surrealism.
   Since the death of his wife in 1982, Dali's physical condition
has deteriorated to the point where he requires constant medical
supervision. A fire at his home in nearby Gerona in 1984 gave him
serious respiratory problems, and he has been on a respirator the
past two years.

<HEAD>Health Official Sees Medicare Savings Without Cuts To Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The doctor who now oversees the nation's
Medicare program and who may play a role in the next administration
says he sees no conflict between George Bush's desire for a kinder
America and indications the president-elect will seek major Medicare
savings.
   ``Of all the list of problems of our health care system, I for
one don't believe one of the problems is too little money,'' William
L. Roper said in an interview last week. ``The problem is we're not
spending as best we could the money we are spending.''
   Bush, pressed by reporters about his budget chief's assertion
that Medicare cuts are likely to be a part of a deficit-reduction
drive, said only that he wants to make the program ``more
efficient.''
   Roper, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, has a
working relationship with several members of Bush's staff, including
Deborah Steelman, the vice president's chief health policy adviser
during the campaign.
   Prior to the election, Steelman offered one example of how Bush's
so-called ``flexible freeze'' on federal spending might affect
Medicare. Given the spiraling cost of health care in general, she
said, Medicare might grow by 8 percent while other programs were
held below the general inflation rate.
   In last week's interview, Roper threw out the same hypothetical
figure to illustrate possible spending for Part B, the portion of
Medicare that pays doctor bills and has been growing at about 15
percent a year.
   ``It's the idea of saying in 1989 we're going to spend what we
spent this year plus 8 percent and that's all we're going to
spend,'' he said. ``That's all there is. There ain't no more.''
   Whatever the final approach, both Democratic and Republican
health experts in Congress agree that Part B is ripe for scrutiny if
only because of its headlong growth.
   Despite widespread criticism that Reagan administration cuts in
Medicare spending threatened the welfare of the nearly 32 million
elderly and disabled Americans covered by the program, the thrust of
the approach has been to cut into the profits of providers such as
hospitals rather than reducing benefits.
   Roper, the first physician to head the Medicare program,
acknowledges that the next target will be doctor fees and that the
outcry will be intense.
   ``HCFA is the favorite four-letter word of the health care
community and I think it is probably always going to be that way,''
he said ruefully.
   Still, he said, ``It makes no sense for me as a political manager
of this huge program to say we're going to willy-nilly spend money,
write a blank check to whoever and at the same time be confronted
with the present reality of the problems in the health care system
and no dollars to do anything about it.''
   Among those admitted problems, he said, are infant mortality
rates higher than other industrialized nations, lack of full access
to health care for 37 million uninsured Americans and inadequate
long-term care programs for a rapidly aging population.
   ``If the kinder, gentler America is going to be able to respond
to the problems the vice president has seen, we've got to have some
money to do it with,'' said Roper. ``If the flexible freeze is going
to work, then on average, programs have to go at the inflation rate.
And if we've got problems like Part B of Medicare that are growing
at several times the inflation rate, something has got to give.''
   He acknowledged that wringing significant savings from the
program will not come quickly.
   The eventual answer, he maintains, is getting more value for
dollars spent, which requires a more questioning attitude to the way
medicine is practiced _ a highly emotional topic for doctor and
patient alike.
   ``Up until recently, the presumption has been if a doctor orders
it, it must be necessary, it must be effective,'' he said. ``Now
we're saying maybe so, maybe not and lets get the information
together to judge that question.''
   To support that approach, Roper recently established programs to
accumulate massive amounts of data on which procedures and tests
work and which don't, with an eye toward possibly revising Medicare
payment policies.
   While the HCFA job is widely acknowledged to be one of the major
``no win'' posts in the health bureaucracy, Roper said he's ``had a
ball'' serving there.
   He is guarded about his prospects during the Bush administration.
   ``I am a longtime admirer and supporter of George Bush and wish
him every success,'' he said. ``... If there is some way I can be
useful in this department, I'd certainly like to hear about it.''

<HEAD>Energy Officials Plan For New, Safer Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As engineers struggle with the aging plants
that now produce U.S. nuclear weapons material, Energy Department
officials are drawing up plans for two new, safer reactors expected
to cost a total of $6.8 billion.
   One proposed design, the smaller and more expensive of two
envisioned, involves technologies that some engineers believe will
lead to commercial reactors that drastically reduce the dangers of
meltdown and contamination.
   Building new reactors has assumed new urgency since April, when
engineers last were able to safely operate the remaining three
production reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.
   ``We feel that we can make the plants at the Savannah River Plant
operate safely, although they are nearing the end of their
operational lives,'' said Ron Cochran, head of the Energy Department
office for the new reactors.
   The first of the Savannah River reactors is not expected to
resume production of tritium, a critical nuclear weapons material,
before January. The new reactors should begin operation in about
1999, said Cochran.
   However, persuading Congress to approve funding for both reactors
may be impossible, given the budget deficit and the $110 billion the
Energy Department says it will need to clean up the existing complex
and make it safe.
   An Energy Department advisory panel, in a report last July, found
``that one of the challenges was to get a new production reactor
built before the Savannah River Plant reactors reach the end of
their useful lives,'' said Cochran.
   The Energy Research Advisory Board recommended building two new
reactors, a heavy-water reactor at Savannah River for an estimated
$3.2 billion and a gas-cooled reactor at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory Reservation, an Energy Department site near
Idaho Falls, Idaho, for about $3.6 billion.
   ``The point of having two is to provide the maximum level of
assurance ... at two geographic locations, so that nothing like a
seismic event could shut down production,'' said Cochran.
   Like the three existing reactors, the new one at Savannah River
would use heavy water as a moderator. It have new safety and design
features, but rely on tritium extraction techniques that have been
proven since 1954.
   The new Savannah River reactor would be adequate to make all of
the tritium needed for nuclear weapons and the gas-cooled reactor in
Idaho would produce at half that rate.
   Both would be built with containment vessels, steel-reinforced
concrete domes like that which prevented the escape of nearly all
the lethal materials from the Three Mile Island accident in March
1979. The current Savannah River Plant reactors rely instead on
thick concrete walls and air-filtration systems to confine
radioactivity.
   Despite its smaller production capacity and igher cost, the
gas-cooled reactor planned for Idaho has many advantages.
   In high-pressure light-water reactors, fuel can reach 4,100
degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt the casing and turn the fuel
into an uncontrollable molten mass if the flow of cooling water is
interrupted.
   In a gas-cooled reactor, meanwhile, uranium grains can reach a
maximum temperature of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit while the shells in
which they are encased do not deteriorate below 3,300 degrees,
making a meltdown or radiation leak theoretically impossible even if
the flow of coolant stops for an indefinite period.
   The gas-cooled reactor at Idaho Falls also could generate dollars
by generating commercial electricity through the year 2038, Cochran
said.
   Lawmakers from South Carolina and Idaho already are beginning to
maneuver to make sure that their states are not left out as plans
for the reactors move forward.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., at an Oct. 5 hearing before the
Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Strategic Forces and Nuclear
Deterrence, said he wanted to ``commend the Department of Energy on
its recent decision to locate the New Production Reactor at the
Savannah River Plant'' and would keep an eye on its progress.
   But Idaho's Sen. James McClure, also a Republican, has charged
Energy Department officials at the South Carolina field office with
suppressing a 1985 report on problems at Savannah River in order to
derail plans for a new production reactor elsewhere.
   If the facts had come out in 1985, McClure said in an Oct. 7
speech on the Senate floor, ``we would be breaking ground right now
on a New Production Reactor. And it would not be at Savannah River.''
   The Energy Department is holding local hearings near the proposed
sites, including one scheduled for Tuesday in Aiken.

   The irreverent march of loonies that made
up this year's 12th Occasional Doo-Dah parade featured chain-saw
wielding marchers ready to attack the crowd.
   But not to worry: The chains had been removed from the saws, so
the blades weren't running.
   The Texas Chainsaw Chainsaw Massacre Drool Team and Night Of the
Living Dead Dishonor Guard showered Sunday's crowd with fake blood
and charged at spectators with the roaring chain saws.
   An old favorite at the Doo-Dah gala, the Synchronized Briefcase
Drill Team, celebrated its 10th appearance at the parade with a new
routine, ``The Big O,'' in which the young executives in business
suits piled their briefcases in a stack and marched around them in a
circle.
   A child driving a toy truck was billed as hauling the
radar-evading stealth bomber, unveiled last week by the Air Force.
The tow hook was attached to nothing.
   The parade was started in 1977 as an answer to what organizers
felt was the stuffy Tournament of Roses, the Pasadena showcase held
on New Year's Day, except when Jan. 1 falls on a Sunday.

   When Harriet Brown answered a knock at her
door Thursday night, it wasn't a late arrival for Thanksgiving
dinner.
   Instead, it was Man Chuan Li looking for help. His wife, Feng
Juan Li, was in the back seat of his car, in labor with the couple's
baby.
   ``He came to the door and said, `Call the hospital,''' Ms. Brown
said. ``When I got out to the car, she was in labor. I said, `You've
got to push. You're having the baby now!'''
   Anna Lynn Li was born in the car shortly thereafter, with the
help of about 15 friends and neighbors who provided blankets and
boiling water.
   ``It was a beautiful scene,'' neighbor Louis Lugo said.
``Everyone was out there half-naked in their pajamas helping. It's
like the community did it.
   ``I was boiling water for no reason. I had a pot of boiling
water, but I didn't know what for. I did it because that's what they
always do on television.''
   An emergency squad took Mrs. Li and Anna Lynn to Grant Medical
Center, where they stayed Friday and were well enough to go home
Saturday.
   Ms. Brown said despite all the excitement, her Thanksgiving Day
ended better than it had begun.
   ``When I got up at 7 in the morning to cook a 25-pound turkey and
my oven blew up, I thought it was going to be a bad day,'' she said.
``But it turned out pretty good.''

<HEAD>Sununu Receives School Benefits Six Years After Leaving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six years after he last taught at Tufts
University, John Sununu remains on the school faculty in what one
official calls an ``extremely rare'' arrangement that allows his
children to receive tuition waivers and other aid.
   Sununu, the New Hampshire governor chosen to serve as White House
chief of staff in the Bush administration, last week declined to be
discuss the arrangement but said last summer, ``I never asked for
any different treatment. This was all done by the board of
trustees.''
   Sununu has had two children enrolled in Tufts since he left the
university and also has children attending the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., and Stanford University
in Palo Alto, Calif.
   The children attending Tufts are granted full tuition waivers and
those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from Tufts as part
of faculty benefits Sununu has received during his six years on
leave from the school, according to Tufts officials. Tuition at
Tufts in the 1987-88 school year was $11,750.
   An official who oversees faculty benefits at Tufts said general
school policy is to grant leaves for up to two years.
   But policies governing such extended leaves by faculty at private
colleges and universities vary greatly, with the longest leaves
generally granted to professors who quit their academic posts for
high-profile government assignments.
   Sununu announced in May that he would not seek a fourth term as
governor and has spent much of his time since then working for Bush.
During the presidential campaign he served as a chief Bush surrogate
attacking the record of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democrats' nominee.
   In announcing that he would not seek another term, Sununu cited
his $68,000 a year gubernatorial salary as too small. His wife
specifically said college tuition bills were a factor in her
husband's decision to leave his post.
   As White House chief of staff, Sununu can earn up to $89,500,
according to government pay scales.
   Tufts officials confirmed Sununu remains on leave from his
tenured teaching post in the mechanical engineering department but
referred most questions about the circumstances of his leave to
President Jean Mayer, who did not return repeated messages from The
Associated Press.
   Mayer's secretary said the school president told her he would
have no comment on Sununu's status.
   Sununu said last summer he intended to eventually return to
teaching at Tufts but had not discussed a date with school
officials. In the school's latest catalog, published in Aug. 15,
1988, Sununu remains listed as an associate professor of mechanical
engineering.
   ``Why not?'' he answered when asked if he believed it was
appropriate for his children to continue to receive tuition waivers
and assistance from Tufts.
   Attempts to reach Sununu this week to discuss his status at Tufts
were unsuccessful. Jerry Little, the governor's spokesman, said
Wednesday that Sununu did not have time to conduct an interview.
   Children of Tufts faculty members, and most other colleges and
universities, are allowed to attend that school free of charge.
Tufts policy also allows children of Tufts faculty to receive $1,250
a semester for a maximum of $2,500 a year to help pay their bills at
any other accredited college, according to Bernice Segal, academic
affairs officer at Tufts.
   Whether those benefits are extended to faculty members on leaves
varies from school to school, according to an informal survey of a
dozen private colleges and universities.
   Sununu said he believed his children at Stanford and MIT received
$1,250 a year from Tufts. He said he did not believe, as Ms. Segal
said, that they were eligible for $2,500.
   The school, citing confidentiality guidelines, refused to say how
much assistance was given to Sununu children attending schools other
than Tufts. But it released the amount which they are eligible to
receive.
   Ms. Segal, to whom all questions about faculty benefits were
referred, said all benefits are available to faculty on full leaves,
including health and disability insurance. Sununu does not receive a
salary from the school.
   She termed it ``rare'' for a faculty member to be granted a leave
of more than two years and ``extremely rare'' for a leave to be
approved for five years or more.
   A department chairman must recommend a faculty member for a leave
and the recommendation must be approved by the school's dean, she
said. Leaves are reviewed annually, she said.
   Tufts spokeswoman Rosemarie Van Camp disputed parts of Ms.
Segal's account and said extended leaves are ``routinely'' given to
faculty members who enter the Foreign Service, an apparent reference
to those who leave Tufts' Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy for
diplomatic jobs.
   Ms. Van Camp said she could not recall any current or former
faculty member except Sununu who had been granted an extended leave
while holding elective office.
   Frederick C. Nelson, dean of Tufts School of Engineering, said
Sununu's leave ``was not an action of my office. I suppose he asked
for it to be continued but that was handled by the president's
office.'' He referred all other questions to Mayer.
   Sununu joined the Mechanical Engineering faculty at Tufts in 1967
and remained in the post until he was first elected New Hampshire
governor in November 1982.
   His daughter Cathy graduated from Tufts in 1982, while Sununu
still was teaching there.
   Another daughter, Elizabeth, graduated in 1983, the first year of
her father's leave of absence and first year as governor.
   A third daughter, Christina, a graduate of the University of
Vermont, is currently enrolled in a graduate program at Tufts,
according to school officials who refused to discuss her specific
course of study.
   Sununu's son, John, attends MIT and another son, James, attends
Stanford.

   The editor of the Orange County Register in
California is the winner of the National Press Foundation's ``Editor
of the Year'' award and the chairman and chief executive of C-SPAN
will receive the foundation's excellence in broadcasting award.
   The awards, announced Sunday, will go to N. Christian Anderson at
the Register and to Brian P. Lamb at C-SPAN, the public affairs
cable network.
   The foundation also voted a special citation for Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who has
been held hostage in Lebanon since March 16, 1985. The two Andersons
are unrelated.
   Christian Anderson was honored for his role in transforming the
Register from a ``voice of libertarian philosophy'' into one of the
nation's most respected newspapers, the foundation said.
   Anderson joined the Register in 1979. Under his leadership, the
foundation said, the newspaper is now ``nationally recognized for
its layout, photos and graphics.'' The Register also won a Pulitzer
Prize for its photo coverage of the 1984 Olympics.
   The foundation described C-SPAN as ``the answer to sound-bite
journalism'' because of its extensive public affairs broadcasting,
including coverage of the House and Senate, congressional hearings,
news conferences and political conventions.
   Lamb helped the cable television industry organize C-SPAN, a
non-profit cooperative, in 1977.
   The foundation's citation for Terry Anderson said he was being
honored ``for his courage and inspiration to journalists around the
world.''
   Christian Anderson and Lamb will be honored at the foundation's
annual awards dinner Feb. 22. Anderson's prize for the George D.
Beveridge Editor of the Year Award includes $5,000 cash, as does
Lamb's prize for the Sol Taishoff Award for Excellence in Broadcast
Journalism.
   Beveridge was a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the
now-defunct Washington Star. Taishoff was founder and longtime
editor of Broadcasting Magazine.
   The foundation, organized in 1975, is an independent non-profit
foundation.

   If clothes make the man, an inmate with
nothing to wear but stained jeans and a T-shirt doesn't cut a very
impressive figure in court.
   Assistant Public Defender Connie McGhee says her clients'
wardrobes have troubled her for years. By last spring, she had seen
too many of her clients _ many in jail since their arrest _ come
poorly dressed to court.
   So Ms. McGhee and another Essex County public defender, Melody
Merola, organized a clothes service in a hall closet.
   ``I decided, `Why not have a few things here at the office?'''
Ms. McGhee recalled. ``We call it `the PD boutique.' The name
stuck.''
   Defense attorneys say they know clothing can prejudice a jury,
and they are wary of clothes-conscious judges. Ms. McGhee said she's
seen clients reprimanded from the bench for improper attire.
   ``I think there's always a difference between a person who's
neatly dressed as opposed to one who comes to court in cutoffs and a
T-shirt,'' she said. ``A court of law is a place of respect.''
   With donations from 40 attorneys and the public, the closet has
begun to fill up. The office now can loan six suits, 17 pairs of
pants and 20 shirts for men. Many more clothes are available for
women, but they are a small portion of the office's clients.
   Located in New Jersey's largest city and representing a clientele
often too poor to post even the lowest bail, the public defenders'
clothes service was an immediate hit, the lawyers say.
   About 15 defendants have made use of the clothes so far, and not
all have returned the garments.
   ``We represent indigent clients and a lot of them really don't
have very much,'' Ms. McGhee said. ``When they are arrested, they
are literally arrested with the only clothes they have _ usually a
pair of pants and a shirt.
   ``One time, I had a guy who came to court in lime-green stretch
pants and navy blue sweat shirt turned inside out. He said he had to
borrow it from someone else,'' she said.
   The public defenders want their clients wearing ``the kind of
clothes that, walking down the street, you wouldn't look at them
twice,'' Ms. Merola said. ``It becomes very, very important that the
client is afforded the basic dignity of looking decent.''

   Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis
Jr. raised $1 million in a charity appearance during their national
tour.
   The money will go to the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center, which
is in Rancho Mirage and cares for sexually and physically abused
children, said Susan Reynolds, a tour spokeswoman.
   Saturday's sold-out show was at the Forum, home of the Los
Angeles Kings hockey team and the Los Angeles Lakers NBA basketball
champions.
   ``Last time I was in this building I was trying out for the
Lakers,'' joked Davis, who also delighted the audience with a spoof
of Michael Jackson's ``Bad.''
   After the show the three performers had dinner with 400 guests
who paid $2,500 to charity for the concert and banquet. Among those
in attendance were Tom Selleck, Chevy Chase, Milton Berle, Gregory
Peck and George Hamilton.
   For the show's finale, all three joined in ``New York, New
York,'' considered a signature tune for Sinatra and Miss Minnelli.

   World chess champion Garri Kasparov of
the Soviet Union dismissed the wedding of a top Soviet player and
the captain of the U.S. chess team as a ``private matter.''
   ``You can do what you like,'' Kasparov told reporters Sunday at
the Chess Olympiad, a team tournament.
   On Friday, Elena Akhmilovskaya, the second-ranked player on the
Soviet women's team, secretly married John Donaldson, an
International master from Seattle. Donaldson served as a non-playing
captain for the U.S. team.
   The couple left Greece on Saturday as news of their marriage
leaked out and flew to Frankfurt, West Germany, relatives said.
   ``They had to leave quicker than they had planned,'' said
Donaldson's father, William, in Philadelphia. ``The story (of the
marriage) got leaked and they were worried about her being able to
come to America.''
   Donaldson and Ms. Akhmilovskaya met during a competition in
Havana, Cuba, in 1985. The elder Donaldson said he expected the
couple to return to the United States this week.

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson donned a white
robe and was baptized in a pool of water with 24 other people at a
Baptist church in Cleveland, where he has been living recently.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, boxing promoter Don King and about 700
people attended the service at Holy Trinity Baptist Church.
   ``Mike, now your job is to take the message of Christ to the
people,'' said the Rev. Henry Payden, who presided with Jackson at a
four-hour service.
   Tyson did not speak during the service and did not comment
afterward.
   Last month, Tyson attended services at the church and prayed with
Payden, who gave him a Bible. ``Mike, you have a way of knocking men
down. But Jesus has a way of picking people up,'' Payden told the
champion at the time.
   The boxer has been beset by personal problems in recent months,
including his much publicized marital problems with actress Robin
Givens, and their subsequent divorce filings.

   Former Green Bay Packer kickoff-return
star Travis Williams spent a few years on the streets himself, but
today he's straightening out his life and wants to help other
homeless.
   ``I get a natural high off of it,'' Williams said last week after
returning from a protest by the homeless and their advocates in
Washington, D.C. ``One day I want to be another Mitch Snyder'' _ a
leading homeless advocate.''
   Williams, 42, quit the National Football League and returned to
his hometown in 1975 to open an arcade that folded a few months
later.
   After that, he was troubled by unemployment, alcoholism and the
drug overdose death of his wife of 23 years.
   Recently, activist Susan Prather met Williams, and encouraged him
to patch up his life. She helped get him a job as a security guard
at a soup kitchen, allowing him to afford a $200-a-month hotel room.
   Now, he's rallying on behalf of those who need homes. ``We'll
still keep campaigning,'' he said. ``We'll still put on the
pressure. We need another year-round shelter ... more low-income
housing.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States.
   The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer. Interviews
were conducted with the adult in the household who had the most
recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The
error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example, for
Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, percentages may not
total 100:

<HEAD>Poll Finds Doubt for Quayle as Drug Czar</HEAD>

   Americans want military patrols and a crackdown
on users to combat illegal drugs, but many doubt the choice of Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle to run the effort, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Although George Bush made a campaign pledge to put his running
mate in charge of the fight against drugs, only 32 percent of the
1,084 adults surveyed said Quayle was the right man for the job.
   As many weren't sure about the selection, and 36 percent said
Quayle was not the right choice to lead the drug war. Republicans
were more supportive of Quayle, but fewer than half of them backed
him as drug chief.
   Although the bill creating the Cabinet-level drug czar prohibits
the official from holding another federal post, Bush has indicated
he might have the drug czar report to Quayle.
   The nationwide poll's respondents far and away said reducing the
federal budget deficit should be Bush's to priority as president _
10 times as many as picked drugs. Majorities backed a tax crackdown
and cuts in defense spending to address the deficit.
   The survey also found support for restrictions on foreign
investments in the United States, and broad backing for aggressive
measures to address the federal trade deficit, including higher
import taxes and quotas.
   On drugs, six in 10 favored drug testing of all federal employees
and two in 10 favored testing some of them. The government now
conducts random tests of federal workers in sensitive jobs, and has
proposed testing privately employed transportation workers.
   There also was support for other drug-fighting efforts. Eight in
10 said Bush should push for a crackdown on illegal drug users and
as many or more backed more federal spending for drug enforcement,
education and treatment.
   Three-quarters said the military should patrol the nation's
borders for drug smugglers. But considerably fewer, 40 percent, said
the military should strike at illegal drug operations abroad.
   In addressing the deficit, respondents firmly opposed most new or
higher taxes. Most also opposed cuts in spending for domestic
programs such as welfare or a freeze in Social Security benefits.
   Strong majorities, however, supported higher taxes on cigarettes
and alcoholic beverages. And a narrow majority, 52 percent, favored
defense spending cuts.
   The survey also found overwhelming support for an Internal
Revenue Service crackdown to collect taxes, an approach urged by
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis in the presidential campaign but
ridiculed by Bush.
   The poll, conducted Nov. 10-20, had a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Those polled were asked: ``What do you think should be George
Bush's No. 1 priority once he takes office?'' Thirty-four percent
said the deficit, an unusually high rate of agreement in an
open-ended question.
   No other category drew a response rate in double digits. Seven
percent cited other economic matters, 5 percent said poverty or
homelessness, 5 percent said defense and the rest were other issues.
   Only 3 percent said drugs, an issue that ranked far higher in
importance in pre-election polls during the summer but then faded in
the fall.
   Respondents gave mixed signals on how to address the deficit.
Two-thirds, for example, favored higher corporate taxes _ but a
third of that group said they would change their minds if
corporations responded by raising prices.
   Opposition to other taxes was stronger: Eight in 10 opposed
higher personal income taxes, three-quarters opposed higher gasoline
taxes, three-quarters opposed taxing the Social Security benefits of
higher-income Americans and 64 percent opposed a national sales tax.
   Only defense cuts were favored by a majority, with particular
support from liberals and Democrats but also backing from moderates
and independents. When respondents were asked specifically if they
supported cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense
program, or Star Wars, 56 percent did.
   On the foreign trade deficit, 65 percent said the United States
should impose higher taxes on imports, and most said they would hold
to that position even if it increased prices for some goods and U.S.
trading partners retaliated.

   A Delta Air Lines jetliner
with 137 people aboard made an unscheduled refueling stop at this
military base because of heavy fog, officials said.
   Flight 1437 was flying from Atlanta on Sunday night when it
encountered heavy fog at Fresno, one of its scheduled stops, said
Delta spokeswoman Rhona Dillon. No injuries were reported.
   The Boeing 737 circled Fresno airport while waiting for the fog
to lift but was forced to refuel at Edwards, an Air Force base 60
miles north of Los Angeles where the space shuttle often lands, she
said.
   ``Apparently, the conditions were such that it was too foggy to
land in Fresno requiring refueling at Edwards,'' the spokeswoman
said. ``We just had to bypass Fresno and go to Los Angeles.''
   Flight 1437 was scheduled to land in Fresno at 7:34 p.m., and
then take off for Los Angeles. It had already stopped in St. Louis,
Salt Lake City, and Reno, Nev., before the unscheduled stop at the
air base, Ms. Dillon said.
   ``The passengers had to wait inside base operations for 30
minutes before they were back in the air again,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jerry Guess.
   Guess said the jet headed for Los Angeles International Airport
at 9:55 p.m.
   Ms. Dillon said she had no further details.
   ``It's not an out of the ordinary thing,'' she said of the
refueling stop.

<HEAD>Former President Vows To Appeal Conviction For Corruption</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President
Salvador Jorge Blanco said he will return from the United States
this week to appeal his conviction and 20-year sentence on
corruption charges.
   The former president and businessmen Leonel Almonte and Juan
Tomas Pena Valentin were found guilty Sunday of embezzling about $5
million in government funds by selling equipment to the armed forces
and the national police at inflated prices during the last two years
of Jorge Blanco's 1982-1986 term.
   In a televised interview from Atlanta, where he has been living
for the past 1{ years, Jorge Blanco called his conviction
``monstrous'' and vowed to return to the Dominican Republic on
Wednesday. He was tried in abstentia.
   Judge Juan Maria Severino sentenced the three to 20 years in
prison and ordered them to pay a total fine of $17.3 million.
   Six of the other eight alleged co-conspirators in the case were
found innocent, and the other two were to be tried separately for
the same charges.
   Jorge Blanco, 60, is the first former Dominican head of state to
be convicted of corruption.
   Under Dominican law, the former president could not present a
defense or witnesses without appearing before the court.
   Defense lawyer Ramon Morel Cerda said Jorge Blanco will be jailed
as soon as he arrives. But the appeal will put the sentence on hold
during a retrial.
   Jorge Blanco was charged with ordering the country's military
chiefs to buy 75 percent of the vehicles, uniforms, foodstuffs and
other necessities for the armed forces and national police from
firms owned by Pena Valentin and Almonte.
   Almonte, a millionaire banker with interests in automotive
dealerships throughout the Dominican Republic, and Pena Valentin,
who has supplied materials to the military and police for 20 years,
listened calmly as the judge read the sentence.
   They were transferred under heavy police escort to La Victoria
Prison, 12 miles from the capital. The businessmen's lawyers said
they will appeal.

   A Georgia businesswoman who found love with
a veteran 82-year-old musher through Alaska's Iditarod dog-sled race
has sold her company to train for this winter's Arctic race.
   Carolyn Muegge, 46, met Norman Vaughan about three years ago when
she and a friend attended a party in his honor.
   Vaughan, a retired Air Force colonel, was working with an
Atlanta-based expedition to try to salvage seven World War II
aircraft buried in Greenland's ice pack. He drove a dog team during
one of Adm. Richard Byrd's Antarctic expeditions in the 1930s and
helped transport wounded soldiers from the front lines in the World
War II Battle of the Bulge.
   ``We were just crashing the party, but he made us stay,'' Muegge
recalled in a recent interview.
   ``After about 15 minutes, he said, `I need somebody to be my
handler over the winter, drive up over the (Alaska) highway with me.
Can you come?'
   ``I thought, Oh God, I had a business to run. But here was this
intriguing, alluring offer to go to Alaska to spend some time with a
man like him.''
   A few days later she agreed, and they spent three weeks preparing
for the 1986 Iditarod race over the 1,049 miles from Anchorage to
Nome.
   ``I'd never been in the snow. Here I am, this girl from the
South, up there in 17-below cold,'' she said.
   She rode in a second sled towed by Vaughan's team during the
first 20 miles out of Anchorage, which is required by race rules.
   ``It just killed me'' when Vaughan went on without her, she said,
``so I decided some day I've got to run a race.''
   In 1987, she ran her own team alongside Vaughan _ ``he was kind
of like my security blanket'' _ but they finished last after the
official time limit expired.
   ``I had a budget rent-a-team. They were a slow team and it was a
small team and we had some problems along the way and we ran into a
snowstorm out on the Yukon that detained us for four days,'' she
said.
   The couple married Dec. 31, 1987, at Vaughan's cabin at Trapper
Creek, Alaska. ``All the guests came by dog team or snow machine,''
Muegge said.
   Muegge didn't run in this year's race. Vaughan, who has been
mushing dogs for 60 years, was the oldest competitor but abandoned
the race when some of his dogs went into heat. He has finished three
races in 10 tries, usually at the back of the pack.
   Muegge, a self-described ``adventure junkie,'' is a skilled
whitewater paddler, bicyclist, outdoor adventurer and judo expert.
She ran Executive Expeditions in Marietta, just outside Atlanta,
taking corporate executives to the outdoors.
   ``I don't really know what draws me to that sort of thing, except
it's the personal challenge to me to see if I can survive,'' she
said.
   Muegge sold her business earlier this year. She and her husband
plan to train four months with their dogs for next March's race.
   Another woman, Susan Butcher, has won the race the past two years
and is the only three-time winner, but Muegge isn't aiming to win.
She does hope to improve on her previous effort and beat her husband.
   ``It's sort of like you gotta go for it when it's there and take
the opportunity and somehow find a way to do it. The worst that
happens is that I have to start all over again,'' she said.

   Researchers and AIDS support groups say they are
concerned that discrimination could result from a legal expert's
contention that AIDS dementia may become a public health hazard in
the workplace.
   Edward P. Richards, a public health lawyer and visiting professor
at the University of Denver, wrote in the Preventive Law Reporter
that employers should transfer people with the AIDS virus out of
``physically risky'' jobs.
   Otherwise, he maintained, the companies could be liable in case
of an accident caused by AIDS dementia, a complication in which the
virus attacks the brain and neurological system.
   ``An employee who is unfit for hazardous activity endangers
himself and other employees,'' Richards wrote in September's issue
of the periodical put out by the University of Denver's National
Center for Preventive Law.
   ``In jobs such as driving a truck or providing professional
services, an impaired employee may also endanger customers and the
general public,'' he said.
   But researchers dispute Richards' view that AIDS virus carriers
run a significant risk of developing AIDS dementia, particularly to
a degree that would impair their job performance.
   They say too little is known about AIDS dementia to begin
regulating it in the workplace.
   Only a tiny minority of carriers who haven't developed other
symptoms of AIDS show signs of dementia, said Bill Bailey, AIDS
policy officer at the American Psychological Association in
Washington, D.C.
   He added that Richards' proposal is ``running the risk of
discriminating against one population group unduly.''
   AIDS dementia was recognized last year by the national Centers
For Disease Control as a formal diagnosis for AIDS. It can strike
people who carry the AIDS virus, also known as HIV, leading to
memory loss, impaired motor functions and other mental and
behavioral problems. AIDS dementia is comparable to other
progressive neurological diseases like Huntington's and Parkinson's,
researchers say.
   It is most common among people who have developed AIDS, they say,
and studies show up to 90 percent of people who die of complications
from AIDS show symptoms of dementia.
   Richards stressed that little or no danger of spreading AIDS in
the workplace exists. But, he said, advanced AIDS dementia can make
people unfit for certain jobs just as diabetes, epilepsy or back
injuries can be grounds for denying someone a particular job.
   He recommended that employers ``routinely screen employees and
job applicants for evidence of HIV infection.''
   Dr. Joyce Kobayashi, who counsels many HIV-positive patients as
director of psychiatric consultation services at Denver General
Hospital, said the data ``is still very sparse'' as to how severe
the manifestations of AIDS dementia will be.
   ``Even if there were some changes, it's not at all clear the
dysfunctions would be significant enough to disqualify (HIV-positive
people) from working,'' Kobayashi said.
   ``I'm not discounting it as an issue. But just because HIV may be
present in the brain doesn't mean a person is demented or that their
cognition will be affected.''
   The World Health Organization in March said: ``There is no
evidence that asymptomatic, HIV-1 infected individuals pose special
problems in safety-related occupations.''
   The WHO report noted that factors including stress, fatigue,
aging, psychological disorders, and drug and alcohol use can affect
job performance.
   ``The critical issue is not the cause of impaired job
performance, but the ability to detect impairment whatever the
cause,'' it concluded.
   Lynne Vance of the National AIDS Network in Washington said
Richards' ideas contradict ``a trend where organizations and
corporations are working out various accommodations so people with
the virus can stay on in their jobs. ...
   ``What we're finding is that people (with the HIV virus) are
functioning very well in the workplace and I think you'd be hard
pressed to find any incidents that would support what he is saying.''
   Richards said having the virus wouldn't disqualify people from
performing most tasks.
   ``In general, ADC (AIDS dementia complex) would disqualify an
employee from performing any activity where being drunk or under the
influence of other drugs would be a disqualification,'' he said.
   ``As a preventive lawyer, I think it's critical that employers
learn about these problems before plaintiffs' lawyers do.''

   Salmonella poisoning may have killed a
psychiatric patient and sickened about 100 other people who ate a
pre-Thanksgiving turkey dinner, according to preliminary tests.
   An autopsy on 61-year-old Ina Duncan's body found salmonella
bacteria in the intestines, Nancy McPartlin, a spokeswoman for the
Westchester County Department of Health, said Sunday.
   The exact cause of death has not been determined, she said.
   Those sickened were served meals Wednesday at three Westchester
County clinics of the Rockland Psychiatric Center and the Archway
Alcoholism Treatment program in Mount Vernon, officials
said.Salmonella bacteria was found in the turkey, stuffing and sweet
potatoes served.
   The food was prepared for about 200 people by the Flik
International Corp., a Mamaroneck catering company that also serves
Iona College in New Rochelle.
   The turkey dinner was cooked at the college and eaten by about 30
students, but as of Sunday none had reported any illness, officials
said.
   Ms. McPartlin said Flik used frozen turkeys supplied by Norbest
Inc., which recalled 20,000 of its fresh turkeys sent to the
Northeast because of possible salmonella contamination. Frozen birds
were not affected by the recall.
   Ms. Duncan showed many symptoms common to food poisoning,
including vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration, and suffered a heart
attack, Ms. McPartlin said.
   Tests on some of the others who fell ill also found elevated
levels of salmonella bacteria, Ms. McPartlin said.
   Ms. McPartlin said health officials had not determined the source
of the salmonella. Samples were to be sent to the state Health
Department for additional tests.

   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen Monday,
and stock prices were sharply lower due to concern over higher oil
prices and the possibility of a U.S. interest rate increase.
   At the end of trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.00 yen, up
0.85 yen from Friday's close of 121.15 yen. It opened higher at
121.60 yen and moved between 121.58 yen and 122.00 yen throughout
the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 43.06-point loser during Saturday's half-day
session, fell another 380.27 points or 1.3 percent to close at
28,983.32 points.
   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar ``was being bought
in expectation that U.S. monetary authorities may (raise) prime
lending rates and the nation's discount rate,'' the rate the Federal
Reserve Board charges on loans to commercial banks.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told reporters
that Japan's central bank was closely watching for a possible move
by the Federal Reserve, Kyodo News Service said.
   The dollar's strength paralleled the firmness of the British
pound despite an increase in British interest rates after news last
week of London's wider-than-expected current account deficit, the
dealer said.
   The firmer dollar, expectations of a move by the Federal Reserve
and higher oil prices encouraged investors to take profits from the
recent rally on the Tokyo stock market, pushing prices lower,
analysts said.
   Volume during morning trading was a relatively heavy 750 million
shares, with most activity in heavy industrials like Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, said Nick Ganner of Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers
International Ltd.
   Steels and heavy industrials were mixed, while the broader market
was weaker.
   Fisheries were helped by press reports over the weekend that said
the Soviet Union's state-owned fish processing company and Taiyo
Fishery have reached an agreement to set up a joint venture on the
Soviet island of Sakhalin to process catches from Japanese and
Soviet vessels.

   ``Andy Answer'' is a cartoon dog in a
medical lab coat who dispenses information about AIDS to school
children.
   He tells kids it's OK to be around people who have AIDS, to play
with them, hug them, and study with them, and he assures them they
needn't worry about getting AIDS because they don't share needles
and aren't ready to have sex.
   ``Andy Answer' is the star of ``A is for AIDS,'' a new videotape
for children that will be shown this spring to about 4,000
fifth-graders in the San Francisco Unified School District.
   ``If kids are playing `AIDS-tag' in the playground, and they
start thinking some guy's going to give them AIDS by touching them,
we have to do something about correcting it,'' says Alissa Ralston,
a member of the California Department of Education's AIDS Advisory
Committee.
   Several other school districts around the country, including in
California, Washington state, Montana, Indiana, Georgia, are
considering the tape for children, some as young as second grade.
   ``We need to reassure young children who worry about AIDS because
of the kinds of comments they hear adults making,'' said Joan
Haskin, administrator for health programs for San Francisco's
schools. ``This videotape is very positive, in good taste with
appropriate language.''
   Charlotte K. Beyers, a journalist and video producer in Palo
Alto, made ``A is for AIDS'' with co-writer and director Aron Ranen
of Los Angeles after Surgeon General C. Everett Koop urged that AIDS
education begin as early as elementary school.
   ``We haven't been talking about AIDS very much at the fourth and
fifth grade levels because it's a sensitive issue,'' says Roy
Bueler, coordinator of the school library program for the
29,000-student Tacoma, Wash., Unified School District. ``Everything
we looked at was for older people in the work place or in high
school, but this tape looked pretty good for our students.''
   In the videotape, Andy takes children on a trip inside a human
body to explain how the disease works. Animated ugly germs with
fangs attack armies of white blood cells led by mustachioed
``generals,'' or T4 cells, that direct the body's immune system.
   The animation shows the panicked white cells overcome by germs,
and Andy explains that it sometimes takes a long time for people
with AIDS to become really sick.
   ``The AIDS virus destroys the immune system, leaving the body
with no protection against disease. And that's why many people with
AIDS become very sick and even die.''
   Dr. Roger Peeks, assistant dean at Stanford University's Medical
Center, appears on the tape to explain, with an air of authority,
that AIDS cannot be caught by touching a person or a doorknob, by
swimming, sitting on a bus or getting bit by a mosquito.
   The tape does not refer to homosexuality. Its only hint that AIDS
can be transmitted sexually is that the children in the tape, who
are about 11 years old, ``aren't ready to have sex.''
   The tape also features visits with two children _ a 9-year-old
girl in New York born with AIDS because her mother shared a needle
with an AIDS victim, and 16-year-old Ryan White of Indiana, a
hemophiliac who got AIDS from a blood transfusion. Both segments
show the children surrounded by family and friends not afraid about
catching the disease.
   Of the 78,985 AIDS cases reported since 1981, 1,257 have been
children under 13, including 1,020 under age 5, according to the
national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Nine hundred
seventy-seven other children have parents with AIDS or are
considered at risk of getting the disease. More than 44,000 AIDS
patients, or 56 percent of all cases, have died.
   ``It's scary stuff,'' said Ralston, who wrote a parents'
guidebook on AIDS. ``You don't want your kid walking around worried
unnecessarily that they're going to catch this disease. At the same
time you want to let them know what the risks are, like if you find
a needle at the playground, you don't touch it. That's AIDS
prevention for kindergartners.''

<TEXT>
   Charging too few Iranian prisoners of war
were being returned by Iraq, Iran said it has halted its exchange of
prisoners from the Persian Gulf conflict.
   Tehran Radio said in a report monitored in Cyprus on Sunday that
Iran's Foreign Ministry sent a letter to the International Red
Cross, sponsor of the exchange, demanding the immediate release of
an additional 67 Iranians.
   Under a Nov. 11 accord, Iran and Iraq agreed to release up to
1,570 sick and disabled POWs in batches of about 150, who would fly
home aboard a plane chartered by the International Committee for the
Red Cross.
   The 10-day operation started Thursday, but Iran freed 52 Iraqi
prisoners instead of 110 due for repatriation that day.
   Iran said the remainder asked for asylum in Iran or recovered
from their wounds and no longer were eligible for exchange.
   In retaliation, Iraq sent back 19 instead of 41 Iranian POWs.
   The third prisoner swap took place Sunday with 52 Iraqis and 19
Iranians being released.
   ``By continuing this behavior, Iraq in effect will keep
imprisoned many sick and wounded Iranian prisoners, and their
release will not be guaranteed,'' the Iranian radio quoted the
letter as saying.
   The radio also quoted the head of Iran's committee for war
prisoners, Ataollah Mohajerani, as saying ``the continuation of the
prisoner exchange depends on Iraq's release of 67 Iranian POWs.''
   The Red Cross and Iraqi officials had no immediate comment on the
Iranian announcement.
   U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations following an Aug. 20 cease-fire
in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war are stalled, but the prisoner
exchange agreement was reached in separate talks with the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross has registered names of 50,182 Iraqi and 19,284
Iranian POWs, but estimates the total number on both sides at
100,000.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 22 Iraqi POWs
due for release on Sunday were ``ineligible'' because they had
recovered from their disability.
   The agency, also monitored in Cyprus, said nine others stayed on
for further medical examinations while three more were granted
asylum in Iran.
   IRNA said only 10 soldiers were among the 19 Iranians repatriated
Sunday. It described the others as civilians _ some aged over 60 _
who were captured by Iraqi troops shortly after they invaded Iran in
September 1980.
   Before the current exchange, the two gulf war foes repatriated
765 Iraqi and 613 Iranian sick and wounded prisoners since 1981.

<TEXT>
   Chip Sprague and his nine Plott hounds are having
trouble finding steady employment guiding would-be bear hunters.
   Despite a resurgence in the state's black bear population,
restrictions on guide licenses and the length of the state's hunting
season have limited bear hunts.
   ``Nobody makes a living guiding bear hunters with dogs,'' said
Sprague, a 36-year-old logger from Ashfield. ``It's got to be
something you love. It's for the sport not the money.''
   Sprague's job helps pay for his avocation and the costs that go
along with owning the Alaskan-bred hounds.
   The 500 black bears found in 400 square miles north of the
Massachusetts Turnpike between the Connecticut River and the
Berkshires form one of the densest populations in New England,
wildlife officials say.
   Hunters had nearly eliminated the bears in Massachusetts before
the hunting season was trimmed in 1969 from 10 weeks to one _ the
third week in November when most bears are hibernating.
   But the bears' acquired taste for corn, which provides them with
a stable food source, began taking a bite out of some farmers'
harvests. So in 1982, the state authorized a second week of hunting,
during late September.
   Unlike the November season, when just two or three bears are
killed, hunters are allowed to track with hounds in September.
Thirty-five black bears were killed in September and 32 in September
1987.
   About half were caught with the help of hounds, said Wayne
MacCallum, acting director of the state Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife.
   He said about 1,100 bear hunters are licensed in Massachusetts,
and each is limited to one bear per season _ hence, the dearth of
work for hunting guides.
   Sprague, who has tagged or shot about 1,000 bears during the last
15 years, said he occasionally guides hunters on six-day excursions
in British Columbia, often camping out in the deep woods when a bear
has led them far from their base camp.
   ``It's an extremely strenuous sport,'' he said. ``You're
following a pack of hounds and you have to go where they're going.
They're following the bear and he's going to go anywhere he can find
to get away.''
   As a child, Sprague began hunting woodchucks in his neighbors'
fields. Lacking for recreation in his rural hometown, Sprague's love
for the sport grew as his father took him hunting on weekends.
   But after hunting in 17 states and all the Canadian provinces,
most of the bear chasing Sprague does is for wildlife researchers
who collar bears to track them and analyze their behavior.
   ``I run bears and tree them. We let most of the bears we get go _
very few bears do we ever actually harvest,'' he said.
   Killing female or young bears endangers the population and
research shows a hound pursuit is preferable to baiting traps and
stalking.
   Some farmers in western Massachusetts try to bag bears wandering
into their cornfields by shooting from behind blinds set up along
paths a bear is known to frequent. But by chasing a bear up a tree,
Sprague can take the time to determine the animal's sex and age.
   ``A still hunter has no way of making that judgment because he
has three to five seconds to make a shot,'' Sprague said. ``They all
look big to somebody the first time they see one.''

   A woman says she has forgiven her husband,
who is accused of killing their two young sons by placing them in a
1,300-degree foundry ladle, and will deal with the criticism for
taking him back.
   Susan Dobben, 29, sat in a car on Thanksgiving Day 1987, while
her husband, Bartley James Dobben, 27, took their children into the
Muskegon foundry where he worked. He told her he wanted to pick up a
Bible and show off his workplace to the children.
   As she waited, he placed Bartley Joel, 2, and Peter David, 15
months, in the hot foundry ladle, authorities said.
   Mrs. Dobben said earlier this month that she has had to deal with
criticism over how she has handled the ordeal, forgiving her husband
and ending divorce proceedings he initiated in April 1987.
   ``One of my friends told me if I stopped the divorce, I'd have
the whole community against me,'' she said. ``But I couldn't live
with myself if I did. People who knew him before will understand.''
   Some therapists also have suggested she was too understanding.
   ``One of the first counselors in Ypsilanti told me that I
couldn't `just forgive' him,'' she said. ``I asked him, `Why not?' I
said, `You're telling me I can't be a Christian? I can't forgive?'''
   Before the deaths, Dobben had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic
and paranoid, she said.
   ``He wasn't taking his medicine (prescribed for schizophrenia and
paranoia),'' she said. ``That was it. That was it. We may end up
having to move away from here, but I want him home. With me.''
   She gave birth to their third son, Jacob, in July.
   More than a year after the deaths, Mrs. Dobben still is unable to
call Bartley Joel and Peter David by name. She refers to them as
``the kids.''
   As difficult as the ordeal has been, it promises to intensify
when her husband goes on trial next year on two counts of murder.
   His trial was to have started Nov. 29 but was postponed until
January.
   Dobben is confined in the Michigan Center for Forensic Psychiatry
near Ypsilanti.
   Terry Nolan, Dobben's court-appointed attorney, has said he will
maintain Dobben was innocent by reason of insanity.
   Mrs. Dobben said she would tell the court the man who killed her
two children ``was not the Bart I knew.''

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke today urged
immigrants to forget their prejudices and act like Australians after
a 16-year-old Croatian boy was shot during a protest outside the
Yugoslav consulate.
   Hawke said newcomers have a right to demonstrate, but cautioned,
``We do not want to see Australia become a battleground in terms of
people trying to live out and act out ancient rivalries that might
still to some extent bedevil their places of origin.''
   On Sunday, 1,500 ethnic Croatians demanding a homeland in
Yugoslavia demonstrated outside the Yugoslav consulate. Police said
a security guard at the consulate shot and wounded the youth while
about five protesters climbed the wall of the compound.
   In a separate demonstration earlier Sunday, about 2,000
protesters threw eggs and placards at a limosine carrying visiting
Greek President Christo Sartzetakis. The protesters demanded Greece
grant Macedonian autonomy.
   Police charged one demonstrator with assault.
   Macedonia, an ancient kingdom in southeastern Europe in the
Balkan Peninsula, is now a region divided among Greece, Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia. The Macedonian language is related to Greek.
   Yugoslavia protested to Australia over the demonstration, said
Yugoslavia's state news agency Tanjug. The report from Belgrade said
demonstrators entered the compound and tried to desecrate the
national flag while police stood by.
   The shooting victim, wounded in the neck and throat, was listed
in satisfactory condition at St. Vincent's Hospital, police said.
   The shooting occurred as protesters demanding a Croatian homeland
marked Yugoslav National Day, the anniversary of the communist
government.
   Yugoslavia was proclaimed a nation on Nov. 29, 1945, with Croatia
and Serbia as two of its six republics.
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, Tanjug said that in the
absence of police intervention the consulate staff ``physically
confronted the attackers. In self-defense, warning shots were fired
in the air from the building.''
   No arrests were made, police said.
   Australian Associated Press said Yugoslav Ambassador Boris Cazal
was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra, the federal
capital, for an explanation.
   Sydney has a large immigrant population from Yugoslavia, which
has been rocked by ethnic strife and economic troubles in recent
months.

   A hushed candlelight march by 15,000 people
rekindled painful memories of the day 10 years ago when two leaders
of the city's progressive political revolution were slain by a
former colleague.
   Led by the doleful beat of five drummers, the procession followed
the 1{-mile route along which 40,000 people marched on Nov. 27,
1978, in a spontaneous outpouring of grief hours after Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were shot to death.
   Milk was the city's first openly homosexual elected official and
a leader of the national gay rights movement.
   Hope rather than despair was the dominant mood Sunday night.
   ``Our purpose as a city 10 years after the deaths is to pledge
that violence will not be the answer in our city,'' Mayor Art Agnos
told the crowd outside City Hall.
   Agnos ordered the doors to the building kept open through much of
the night and invited marchers to observe a moment of silence in the
rotunda.
   Describing Moscone and Milk as politicians who wanted to give all
groups a voice in local government, Agnos declared to wild cheers,
``The doors are open to honor them and you.''
   A large black-and-white photograph of the two men was displayed
inside the building, along with portions of The Names Quilt, made to
honor those who have died of AIDS. Most victims of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome have been homosexuals.
   ``The deaths of Moscone and Milk I think taught us how to deal
with death, in the sense that we learned not to let grief defeat
us,'' said Chris Cunningham, 31.
   ``It hurts to remember this, but we've learned, and it's really
hit home with AIDS, we must all care for each other; that no one is
a reject; everyone's part of the human race,'' he added. ``That's
what San Francisco is about.''
   Folksinger Joan Baez, who had sung to the crowd on the steps of
City Hall a decade ago, sang a folk song about the killing of a
union activist, and the crowd cheered the line, ```I never died,'
says he.''
   Memorials for Milk also were scheduled in at least 10 cities
nationwide for Sunday and today, including Washington, New York,
Kansas City, Mo., Atlanta, Houston and San Diego.
   Former Supervisor Dan White, a conservative Catholic who had been
a policeman and a firefighter, killed Moscone and Milk just before
the populist mayor had planned to announce he would not reappoint
White to the Board of Supervisors seat he had resigned 17 days
earlier.
   Under pressure from Milk and his newly formed homosexual
political machine, Moscone had planned to appoint a neighborhood
activist instead, creating the first liberal majority on the
11-member commission.
   White escaped a first-degree murder charge and was convicted of
involuntary manslaughter after defense lawyers, using what was
called the ``Twinkie'' defense, convinced jurors that eating junk
food had diminished White's mental capacity. The verdict triggered a
riot by 5,000 people.
   White served five years of his 7-year, eight-month sentence. He
committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage on Oct.
21, 1985, 19 months after getting out of prison.

   Helmeted policemen fired tear gas at
bomb-throwing demonstrators outside Dhaka University today during a
half-day general strike to demand the ouster of President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad, witnesses said.
   At least five people, including a policemen, were injured by
fragments from small homemade bombs, police said. Twenty people were
arrested by the time the strike ended at 12 noon, police said on
condition of anonymity.
   The strike was sponsored by two of Bangladesh's main opposition
groups as part of their year-long effort to force Ershad to resign.
   Most stores failed to open, and cars stayed off the streets
during the six-hour strike.
   The city of 6 million people was generally calm except around
Dhaka University, where police confronted roving bands of youths who
threw stones, bricks and homemade bombs.
   Paramilitary troops from the Bangladesh Rifles patrolled the
streets in trucks.
   About 50 protesters hurled small bombs that generally exploded
harmlessly in the street in front of the university's arts building,
witnesses said.
   Police responded by firing at least a dozen tear gas shells to
disperse the bomb-throwers, according to Mohammad Alam Said, a
photographer for the Bengali-language newspaper Ittefaq.
   The strike was called by Jamiaat-e-Islamic, a Moslem
fundamentalist party, and a seven-party alliance led by Khaleda Zia,
head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   The third main opposition group, an eight-party alliance headed
by Sheik Hasina of the Awami League, did not join the strike but
planned to hold rallies across the nation as part of a ``resistance
day against the autocratic regime.''
   Mrs. Zia and Hasina put aside their personal differences a year
ago to cooperate in an ``Ershad must go campaign.'' Their series of
often violent strikes failed to budge the former army general,
leaving the opposition divided and fractious. The women blamed each
other for the failure and have pursued separate protests.
   Rain helped ease the tension in the early hours of today's
strike, with both protesters and police staying off the streets in
large numbers. Some people walked to work, since most public
transport halted. A few state-run buses and some privately owned
bicycle-powered rickshaws plied the streets.
   A senior official at the Bangladesh Secretariat, the government's
administrative center, said employee turnout at government offices
and banks was thin in the early morning but increased later.

<HEAD>President Says Her Government Is Stable Despite Failed Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
her government was stable despite what the military called a failed
bid over the weekend to duplicate the mass uprising that toppled
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, said troops and police blocked convoys late
Saturday carrying about 1,000 civilians into Manila. He speculated
many were supporters of Marcos, now in exile in Hawaii.
   Oxales said convoy leaders planned to surround military garrisons
in the capital, much like the February 1986 ``people power''
uprising that ousted Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
Leaflets promised establishment of a ``constitutional military
government,'' he said.
   Police said today five people remain in custody, facing charges
of illegal assembly. Sedition charges were being prepared against
the suspected organizer, Jose Ocampo, who remained at large,
authorities said.
   ``The situation now is normal,'' Oxales said. ``But the military
is on alert to prevent any further attempt.''
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she did not consider the incident a
coup attempt.
   ``They were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed,''
she said. ``I guess people will keep on trying (to undermine her
government), but I think they should realize now that the people are
against them and they will not support them in something like this.''
   Oxales said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewards
of up to $200,000 for the capture of senior military officers who
remained loyal to Mrs. Aquino.
   ``The armed forces of the Philippines is now taking over the
government,'' Oxales said, reading fromn the leaflets.
   He said the participants appeared to be civilians and there was
no evidence any soldiers joined the move.
   Oxales quoted participants as saying they were offered money to
join the convoy and were told they would attend rallies at the
presidential palace and elsewhere to protest ``economic grievances.''
   Participants, mostly from agricultural areas near the capital,
were also given ``liberation bonds'' that could supposedly be
redeemed after the new government was installed, Oxales said.
   Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs.
Aquino. The most serious took place Aug. 28, 1987, when about 2,000
mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital.
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded,
including Mrs. Aquino's only son, Benigno Aquino III. Mutiny leader
Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan was arrested in December 1987
but escaped last April.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Cambodian Refugees Flee Shelling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shelling along the Cambodian border has
forced 5,000 Cambodian refugees back to a U.N.-sponsored camp from
which they had been forcibly moved by communist Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, a Thai official said today.
   International aid officials on the Thai-Cambodian border said one
report claimed there were hundreds of casualties, but that report
could not be confirmed. No casualties have been taken to
internationally-aided medical facilities, the officials said.
   The shelling is believed to have come from Vietnamese forces
occupying Cambodia or forces of the Vietnamese-installed government
in that country.
   The refugees fled the Khao Phlu area, in Thailand's eastern Trat
province about 3{ miles from the Cambodian border, after the
artillery and rocket attacks peaked Nov. 15-19, said a Thai military
officer who requested anonymity.
   They fled back to Ta Luan, a camp several miles west from which
the Khmer Rouge had forcibly moved them, Thai military officers said.
   From Nov. 16-19, 249 artillery rounds crashed into the area, said
an officer of the Eastern Chantaburi-Trat Field Force.
   Reporters visiting the Trat border last week could hear the
sporadic boom of shelling in the jungled hills. Thai officers said
today the shelling had ended.
   They said Thai authorities were working with the International
Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Border Relief
Operation to help any Cambodians who may have been wounded.
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting the
Vietnamese, moved the population from Ta Luan from June to
September, leaving behind 1,000-2,000 disabled, elderly or sick
people.
   In a radical bid to fashion a new agrarian society, the Khmer
Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled Cambodia
from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978.
   It moved the Ta Luan population apparently to try to populate
areas just inside Cambodia that were evacuated by Vietnamese forces
beginning last year. The international relief agencies and the U.S.
State Department have condemned the movements to Khao Phlu, a
heavily mined, malarial region.
   Thai military officers said Thursday that fighting has picked up
since early October, with shells striking six Thai border provinces.
Fighting is expected to intensify further in the next few weeks with
the approaching dry season.
   Vietnam has withdrawn some troops 19 miles from the Thai border
area to ease tensions with Thailand.
   But Lt. Patana Jiranant of the Eastern Chantaburi-Trat Field
Force said, ``Fresh units being sent in to free others near the
(Thai-Cambodian) border would suggest Vietnam's new readiness to
engage in escalated fighting with the Cambodian resistance groups.''

   Traffic accidents killed more than 400 people on
the nation's highways during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend.
   A preliminary count put the number of deaths at 415 nationwide.
   The National Safety Council had estimated that between 450 and
550 motorists could lose their lives during the period, from 6 p.m.
Wednesday to midnight Sunday local time.
   During a similar non-holiday period at this time of year, 390
traffic deaths could be expected, council statisticians said.
   Last year, there were 494 people killed in highway accidents
during the Thanksgiving holidays. The deadliest Thanksgiving weekend
was in 1968 when 764 died.

Opponent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A longtime opponent of North Yemen's
U.S.-backed military government said shots fired at him and three
friends outside a restaurant here represented an assassination
attempt.
   ``I know that's true. I'm against the military dictatorship in
North Yemen and I've always stood for freedom and democracy. I have
received death threats,'' Ibrahim Alwazir said Sunday, adding that
past attempts have been made on his life.
   ``The government spends a lot of money on terrorist attacks and
they always follow people who are in opposition to the government.''
   Police said they were looking for two men who were driving a
black Cadillac, but they couldn't determine the reason for Saturday
night's attack.
   ``No motives have been established. We're still interviewing
witnesses,'' said Police Lt. Ray Wysocki.
   North Yemen, a country of about 5.9 million in the southwestern
Arabian peninsula, is a U.S. ally. Its southern neighbor, South
Yemen, has a pro-Soviet government.
   Telephone calls to the North Yemen Embassy in Washington were
unanswered Sunday.
   Gunfire from a passing car missed Alwazir but a companion, Naji
Isa, 30, was shot in the left leg. He remained in serious but stable
condition at Oakwood Hospital early today, a nursing supervisor said.
   James Heckelman, who was near the restaurant shortly before the
shooting, said a man drove past and scrutinized him.
   ``He said to a man with him, `He's not the one,''' Heckelman
said. Minutes later, Heckelman said, he saw the man start shooting.
   Alwazir, 56, was entering the restaurant for an informal meeting
during his three-day visit to the Detroit area from his home in
Washington. Dearborn is home to many in the area's large Arab
community.
   The gunmen ``were spraying bullets all over the place. There were
not competent. A lot of the bullets went into the wall. They were
very scared,'' said Abdul Galil Ahmed, one of Alwazir's three
companions.
   Alwazir said his father and an uncle were executed in 1948 for
espousing democracy in their Middle Eastern country. He said he
escaped from the country in 1954 and has lobbied for democracy in
North Yemen since then.

<TEXT>
   The Central Committee, the policy-making body of
the ruling Communist Party, convened today to consider proposals for
revamping the central government's relationship to the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Critics say such revisions, which come after weeks of controversy
over proposed constitutional amendments, would concentrate too much
power in the Kremlin.
   The official news agency Tass said today that President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev was delivering a report to the 300-member body, but
gave no further details.
   The Central Committee meeting, known as a plenum, is a prelude to
Tuesday's meeting of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, but it is
not known whether it will take up the issue of ethnic unrest now
sweeping the southern republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia. At least
six people died in protests there last week.
   The news agency said the party meeting is considering ``measures
to effect political reform in state development,'' but made no
mention of the unease in the Caucasus.
   The proposed constitutional changes have stirred controversy
particularly in the Baltics, where the Estonian parliament on Nov.
16 declared the republic ``sovereign'' and claimed authority to
conduct its own business except in regard to foreign policy and
defense.
   The parliaments in neighboring Lithuania and Latvia stopped short
of approving similar measures, but activists there still oppose more
centralized power and are agitating for defeat of the constitutional
changes.
   In addition, thousands in the southern republic of Georgia have
protested the proposed amendments and many have expressed support
for Estonia's action. Soviet newspapers have contained numerous
letters objecting to proposals that readers say could produce a
dictator.
   Gorbachev appeared at a Saturday meeting of the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet and pronounced the Estonian action unconstitutional,
saying it ``must be rejected as mistaken, not having any legal
force.''
   He said the Presidium, which is the nation's highest executive
body, had made several changes.
   None of the reports has given details of the revised plan, but a
special legislative commission recommended conciliatory language to
remove some of the most oft-stated objections.
   The news agency said the Presidium ordered development of a
system to widen and protect the rights of the 15 republics that make
up the Soviet Union.
   Tass said the system would ``secure the political, social and
economic interests of the constituent republics and broaden and
uphold their sovereign rights in the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.''
   The current law theoretically provides a mechanism for republics
to secede from the Soviet Union, but Moscow's hold has been too
strong for any republic to consider exercising that provision. The
draft constitutional amendments would eliminate the provision
altogether.
   The latest round of violence in Azerbaijan has resulted in at
least six deaths, firebombings and reported beatings. Soviet
soldiers have cordoned off Armenian districts within Azerbaijani
cities.
   Ethnic fighting in the area began in February over control of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is populated mainly by Armenians but
lies within Azerbaijan's borders.

<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali
was resting today after a quiet night in Figueras Hospital, where he
was taken a day earlier suffering from pneumonia and a heart
condition, his doctor said.
   Dr. Carlos Ponsati said the 84-year-old Dali's condition, though
serious due his advanced age, was stable. ``He spent a calm night
and his fever has gone down'' since his hospitalization Sunday,
Ponsati said.
   Dali, who was born in this small Catalonian town in northeastern
Spain near the French border, is best known for his paintings of
limp watches over troubled landscapes and other disturbing works.
   He was one of the leaders of the surrealist movement and is one
of the last surviving members of an outstanding generation of
Spanish painters that included Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro.
   Dali has lived in seclusion since the death of his wife, Gala, in
1982. Since then his physical condition has required constant
medical supervision.
   He has been wheelchair-bound in his Galatea Tower mansion since
suffering severe burns in a 1984 fire that left him with serious
respiratory problems.
   In July, 1986, Dali underwent surgery to install a permanent
pacemaker after a mild heart attack.

   Cardinal John O'Connor says the United States
should let Yasser Arafat speak if the United Nations wants to hear
him, but a Jewish group praised the Reagan administration's decision
to deny a visa for the PLO leader.
   ``If the U.N. is prepared to listen to someone, then I think, on
principle, it's good to give that opportunity,'' O'Connor,
archbishop of the Roman Catholic church New York Archdiocese, said
Sunday.
   Speaking Sunday after Mass in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral,
O'Connor said, ``I think I can understand both sides, but ultimately
_ given the greatness of this country and the ease with which we can
make known our position on various things _ on principle I would
rather see us admit people (and) state what our national position
is.''
   But he conceded that ``whether that should be done in the Arafat
case is complicated.''
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith, issued a statement calling the visa
rejection ``a courageous blow by the Secretary of State against
international terrorism and a reminder by the United States that the
PLO still advocates and practices terrorism.''
   The State Department on Saturday denied a visa to the Arafat,
saying the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman ``knows of,
condones and lends support to'' terrorist attacks.

<HEAD>EPA Plan For Bruin Lagoon Cleanup Questioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUIN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional office and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency are divided over the adequacy of
cleanup plans for one of the nation's worst toxic waste dumps with
work set to begin in a few months.
   Under the plan drawn up by the EPA, a contractor is to dig out
highly acidic sludge in the four-acre Bruin lagoon 45 miles north of
Pittsburgh, mix it with lime and soil to neutralize and immobilize
it, and then bulldoze it back in place.
   ``It was our feeling this would be just as protective of human
health as other measures and would be less expensive,'' said Ray
Germann, a spokesman for the EPA's Region 3 headquarters in
Philadelphia. ``It can be a permanent remedy, insofar as it can
prevent hazardous substances from reaching the public into the
forseeable future.''
   But some independent experts say the cleanup method chosen for
the old oil refinery dump is a short-term, low-cost and
low-technology effort. They say a more permanent solution would be
appropriate for what is listed as No. 3 on the government's priority
list of 1,175 Superfund hazardous waste sites.
   ``Over the short term, it may limit movement of materials from
the site,'' said Joel Hirschhorn, a senior associate for the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment, who reviews the
effectiveness of Superfund cleanups.
   ``In the long term, all such capping and cover systems break
down, and water will get in. Continued money will have to be put in
that site, and any lapse in vigilance will cause problems,'' he said.
   The lagoon is filled with a highly acidic sludge that has the
consistency of soft asphalt. It is composed of oils, grease, other
petroleum byproducts, solvents and toxic metals, and it is saturated
with several organic compounds and a termite pesticide in
concentrations far above the EPA's drinking water standard.
   More than 30 homes stand within 500 feet of the lagoon.
Pollutants from the dump have not shown up in the wells of nearby
homes so far, the EPA has found.
   Work on the site is expected to begin next spring and last a
year. It will cost up to $5 million, with the federal Superfund, a
pool of money from petroleum and chemical industries and large
manufacturers, paying 90 percent of the cleanup costs. The state
will pay the rest and will maintain the site after the first year.
   Bruin residents not only consider the plan sufficient, they say
any cleanup is a waste of money that draws unfavorable publicity to
their town.
   ``We don't worry. We've lived with it all our lives. We knew
that's a place you don't go near,'' said Beverly Hawk, who lives
within a few hundred yards of the lagoon and whose childhood dog had
to be shot when it got stuck in the sludge.
   ``I don't care if they do anything or not,'' said Betty Lou
Moser, whose back yard borders the dump. ``We lived here all our
lives and it never bothered anybody. They could have bought the town
for the money they spent.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan said
today that 429 bodies were recovered from storm-ravaged villages of
southern Thailand in the country's worst natural disaster in decades.
   ``We need aid from foreign countries,'' he said after an
emergency Cabinet meeting. The United States and Britain provided
initial assistance today with relief checks totaling $43,400.
   Floods and mudslides from a week of heavy rains starting Nov. 19
struck 12 southern provinces. Dozens of people are still buried in
the mud, Chatichai said.
   More than 380 people remain missing and 2,050 others were
injured, said Maj. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya, deputy commander of the
Fourth Army Region in the south.
   The same weather system that battered southern Thailand moved
through Malaysia a few days earlier, killing 31 people and forcing
tens of thousands from their homes.
   Chatichai said the flooding and mudslides affected about 600,000
people, destroyed 7,000 houses and caused $120 million in damage.
   Kitti said 16 helicopters were dropping food and medicine to
isolated villages. Hundreds of troopers were sent to clear routes to
transport emergency supplies to the villages, he said.
   Many of the dead were in villages in Nakhon Sri Thammarat
province, where mud and thousands of logs cascaded down hillsides
left barren by illegal logging, slamming into houses and crushing
people.
   Chatichai today ordered a search for the poachers responsible,
but little has been done despite repeated promises by successive
Thai governments to control the problem, which involves widespread
official corruption.
   Today, the British Minister for Construction, David Trippier,
told Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila that Britain was
providing $90,500 in immediate assistance. He presented Siddhi a
check for $18,400 and said urgent steps would be taken to transfer
the remainder.
   ``This is an appalling tragedy, which has shocked and saddened
the British government,'' Trippier said.
   Also today, U.S. Ambassador Daniel O'Donohue gave Siddhi a check
for $25,000 in emergency aid and said the United States would
provide $40,000 more. The additional aid was recommended by a U.S.
Embassy team that flew to the ravaged areas Saturday.
   In a related development, officials in Malaysia said the
situation there was rapidly improving with flood waters subsiding
and only about 10,600 storm victims still in relief centers.

   Gang violence during the Thanksgiving holiday
weekend left two men dead and five others wounded, while three
officers escaped injury in drive-by shooting attempt, police said.
   Clifford Newell, 22, of Los Angeles, died Saturday from a gunshot
wound suffered on Thanksgiving in a drive-by shooting, Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies said.
   A teen-ager whose body was dumped on a street in North Hollywood
on Friday night was identified as Angel Roman, 18, of Los Angeles,
the coroner's office said.
   Roman, who was shot in the head in an execution-style slaying,
was a known gang member but detectives had not determined a motive
or arrested anyone, city police said.
   Elsewhere, an unidentified 18-year-old reputed gang member was in
stable condition after he was hit in the head by shotgun fire from a
passing car early Sunday near downtown, police Sgt. Hal Butler said.
   On Saturday, six reputed gang members opened fire on two people
returning from a concert during an argument, Sgt. Paul Hernandez
said. The two victims, not known gang members, were hospitalized in
stable condition, he said.
   Also Friday night, two sheriff's sergeants and a deputy escaped
injury when they were targeted in a drive-by shooting, Sheriff's
Deputy Detta Roberts said. But a teen-ager and a 21-year-old man
were slightly wounded when bullets struck a wall and showered them
with debris.
   After a car chase, deputies arrested Angel Ernest of Los Angeles
for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon, Ms. Roberts said.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said ethnic
strife is threatening his program of economic and social reforms,
and he said restructuring is the cure for the violence, not the
cause.
   Gorbachev was reacting to a wave of nationalist unrest that has
swept across the country from the Baltic republics in the northwest
to the Caucasus in the southwest.
   In a related development, the policy-making body of the ruling
Communist Party, the Central Committee, met today to review
proposals for revamping the central government's relationship to the
15 Soviet republics.
   Official media said Gorbachev was delivering a report today to
the 300-member body, but no further details were available.
   Among the draft proposals before the Central Committee are
constitutional amendments that critics say would concentrate too
much power in the Kremlin and eliminate the legal possibility for
republics to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev said in a speech broadcast on state television Sunday
that ``attempts are being made to kindle dislike in the interethnic
sphere.''
   ``This would be disastrous, it would put perestroika in
jeopardy,'' he said, referring to his reform campaign. ``It would
even make some people think that it is, perhaps, perestroika that is
to blame for all that.''
   He said his policy of opening up information and opinion is the
solution to ethnic tension, which exists in many of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Gorbachev's remarks come during violent tensions between the
neighboring southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan and during
demands for increased autonomy in the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
   He made his speech Saturday before the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the nation's top executive body.
   Saturday's session of the Presidum struck down an Estonian
declaration of limited sovereignty made earlier this month, official
media reported. Estonia declared then that it had the right to veto
Soviet laws.
   Official media said Gorbachev acknowledged before the Presidium
that national constitutional amendments he has proposed may have
angered Estonians and others by curtailing local rule.
   But his remarks Saturday also carried a veiled warning. ``I must
say we receive a great number of letters from working people in
every republic with remarks that we are at times too tolerant with
regard to extremists,'' Gorbachev said.
   In Azerbaijan on Sunday, two Communist Party officials were
reported fired.
   Soviet newspapers charged that local authorities were not helping
soldiers halt the ethnic violence in the republic.
   Rallies of up to 500,000 people were reported Sunday in Baku, the
republic's capital.
   The military newspaper Red Star said local officials are not
helping troops trying to keep the clashing Azerbaijanis and
Armenians apart in the Azerbaijani city of Kirovabad.
   At least seven people were killed and 160 injured in Kirovabad in
last week's violence between the mainly Christian Armenians and
Moslem Azerbaijanis, reports have said.
   A duty officer at the Azerbaijani Communist Party headquarters in
the city of Baku denied charges that local authorities were not
helping the military quell the violence, saying ``The party is in
control.'' He refused to give his name.
   Ethnic fighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians first began in
February and culminated in last week's massive demonstrations.
   The Armenians, who dominate the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan, are demanding that it be annexed to neighboring Armenia.
   Tass reported Sunday that building materials were being removed
from a construction site for an Armenian workshop and recreation
center in Azerbaijan's Topkhan Natural Preserve. The official news
agency said the construction of the center at an Armenian-controlled
aluminum factory contributed to last week's unrest.

<HEAD>Worker Compensation Official Rules that Judge Died of Overwork</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's widow was awarded $21,000 a
year in workers' compensation by a commissioner who ruled her
husband died of overwork and stress from his numerous state tasks.
   Commissioner Rhoda Loeb ruled recently that Superior Court Judge
Frank J. Kinney's fatal heart attack two years ago was caused by
stress and overwork from the legion of jobs he performed for the
state Judicial Department.
   She described Kinney as ``the epitome of the work ethic.''
   ``I would rather have my husband than the money,'' said Kinney's
wife, Joan. ``That means nothing to me. ... He was a very
self-sacrificing person, and we always got along on very little.''
   Kinney, who served 14 years on the bench, died in September 1986
at the age of 54. At the time, Kinney served as presiding criminal
judge and administrative judge for the New Haven Judicial District,
administrative judge for state criminal courts, chairman of a panel
on grand juries and chairman of a commission on alternative
sentencing.
   Chief Court Administrator Aaron Ment, a witness at the
compensation hearing, said that after Kinney's death, it was decided
that no one judge would ever again be asked to assume so many jobs
for the department.
   Loeb's ruling marked the first time in state history that a judge
was found entitled to benefits under the Workers Compensation Law,
said Brewster Blackall, the assistant state attorney general who
opposed the claim.
   The state, which is appealing, had argued that judges are
appointed officials who do not fit the compensation law's definition
of employees.
   Loeb awarded Mrs. Kinney a stipend of $408 a week for life,
retroactive to her husband's death. She was already receiving
$20,000 a year from her husband's pension benefits.

<TEXT>
   Afghan resistance leaders and top
Soviet representatives will meet in the next week to discuss
exchanging prisoners, the withdrawal of Soviet troops and postwar
Afghanistan, a rebel spokesman said today.
   The Soviets on Sunday held their first direct talks with Moslem
insurgents over the exchange of prisoners of war since Red Army
troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan in May.
   The rebels have offered as a ``goodwill gesture'' to exchange
four Soviet prisoners of war for 100 guerrillas, said Shah Mahmood
of the hard-line Hezb-e-Islami group. He said the offer was made at
the meeting but the Soviets did not respond.
   Guerrilla spokesmen Abdul Rahim and Ghairat Bahir, representing
two rebel groups, met four Soviet embassy officials, including naval
and air attache Col. Victor Belyi, at the Pakistani Foreign Ministry.
   Rahim, of the fundamentalist Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group, said
the Soviets wanted talks split between military issues, specifically
prisoners of war, and problems such as the political makeup of a
postwar Afghanistan.
   Rahim refused to divulge details except to say a high-level
meeting ``will be outside Pakistan ... within the next week.''
   The rebels and the Soviets refused to say whether the prisoner
exchange meeting ended with any commitment on the release of all or
part of some 300 soldiers Moscow has said are missing in Afghanistan.
   Rahim said the Soviet delegation wants specifics on prisoners
being held by the guerrillas, and ``we were trying to tell them
there are other issues of Afghanistan, not only prisoners of wars.''
   ``They are talking about peace and in the meantime they are
bringing in new weapons,'' said Rahim. Moscow introduced MiG-27
fighter jets and surface-to-surface Scud missiles into Afghanistan
in October despite its pledge to remove its forces by Feb. 15.
   ``We hope this meeting will convince them to start to speed up
the withdrawal and stop the escalation of the war,'' said Rahim. The
Soviets were promised ``that any move seen from the Russian side
will be matched by movement from the mujahedeen,'' or guerrillas,
Rahim said.
   Makeup of the rebel contingent to meet with the Soviets has yet
to be decided, although Rahim said Burhanuddin Rabbani, the current
spokesman of the loose, guerrilla alliance, would meet alone or head
a delegation.
   Nickolai Portikov of the Soviet Embassy's political section
refused to confirm or deny the impending meeting.
   ``I am not going to make any specific statements on the future,''
he said. Today's talks ended only ``with a promise that there will
be a continuation of meetings,'' Portikov said.
   Rahim said the Soviet representative had not been decided either,
but he speculated the job might go to Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet
ambassador to Afghanistan and Moscow's deputy foreign minister.
   Shah Mahmood said Vorontsov was appointed ambassador to Kabul
``just for the purpose of talking to the mujahedeen.''
   ``There is no other need for such a powerful man to be ambassador
in Afghanistan,'' he said.
   In the past month, Soviet statements from Moscow and Kabul have
warned that stepped up attacks by U.S.-backed guerrillas threaten to
derail a withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   In an agreement signed in Geneva last April, the Soviet Union
promised to withdraw an estimated 100,000 troops from Afghanistan
from May 15 to Feb. 15.
   Half left by Aug. 15 and despite strongly worded warnings by the
Soviet Union, it promised to meet the February deadline.

   New hearts made sweethearts of Donald
Homrich and Terri Nelson.
   Both received transplants to replace hearts destroyed by
cardiomyopathy, a degenerative disease. The couple met when Homrich,
who was involved in a support group, called Nelson in November to
offer encouragement and tell her about the group.
   Nelson, 28, received her new heart at the University of Michigan
Medical Center in Ann Arbor on Sept. 14, 1987.
   When Homrich called, ``I was still having some rejection problems
with my new heart and I wasn't the least bit interested in the
support group,'' Nelson recalled.
   ``But I was interested in meeting this man with the very sexy
voice,'' she said.
   The phone call lasted three hours ``because we had so much in
common,'' Nelson said. The two agreed to meet a couple of days later.
   ``We didn't talk a lot about our heart transplants, but Don was
an inspiration to me in the way he had gone on with his life after
his operation,'' Nelson said.
   The two are now planning cross-country ski trips, a Christmas
vacation to the Bahamas, and college courses in January.
   Homrich, 30, underwent heart transplant surgery in April 1984 at
Presbyterian University Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   He said the couple may consider marriage.
   ``Things all came crashing down on each of us once already, and
we just take one day at a time,'' he said. ``We've done so much
together, and we're thankful just for that.''

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias resumed
fighting today, killing five people and wounding 15 others in
clashes despite a Syrian shoot-to-kill threat, police said.
   Gunmen of the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, fought for 40 minutes before dawn around
the Iranian Embassy in west Beirut's seaside Jnah district,
authorities said.
   Police said two people were killed and six wounded. Syrian
peacekeeping troops then intervened and halted the flare-up.
   Three other people were killed and seven wounded in a 20-minute
mortar duel shortly after midnight in south Beirut, police said.
   The new casualties raised the total to 40 killed and 87 wounded
since the latest Amal-Hezbollah confrontation resumed Wednesday.
   The command of the Syrian army's 12,000-man contingent in charge
of security in west and south Beirut set a 1 p.m. deadline Sunday
for the warring militiamen to withdraw from the streets.
   ``The Syrian army has orders to shoot on sight any gunman on the
streets in Beirut and the southern suburbs after the deadline,'' the
ultimatum said.
   Police said the Syrians have not yet opened fire despite the
violations.
   The leftist daily As-Safir said today the Syrian command was
seeking to disarm the militias in west Beirut and then deal with the
southern slums.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified high-ranking Syrian security
source as saying Syria will take ``radical measures, least of which
is the disarmament of Beirut and the expulsion of the combatants.''
   ``Then, we will deal firmly with the situation in the southern
suburbs,'' the source was quoted as saying. As-Safir did not
elaborate.
   The Syrian army that intervened in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League since has made several
futile attempts to disarm the militias and end the nation's 13-year
civil war.
   Israel could not disarm the militias when it invaded Lebanon in
1982 to dislodge Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat's guerrillas from their main Middle East power base.
   A multinational peace force that involved U.S. Marines and
French, Italian and British troops also failed to restore stability
to the capital in a 17-month duty that started in September 1982
after the Israelis withdrew from Beirut.

<HEAD>Likud Tries To Woo Labor Into Joint Government</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: CORRECTS first graf to say Likud bloc, not party.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the right-wing Likud bloc gave Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir approval today to make a major concession to
lure the rival Labor Party into a governing coalition, party leaders
said.
   Shamir was scheduled to meet Labor leader and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres today to discuss the proposals, Israel radio reported.
Such a meeting could be a major step toward forming a broad-based
government similar to Israel's outgoing Cabinet.
   The 10 Likud ministers decided at a two-hour meeting to offer
Labor two powerful Cabinet jobs, defense minister and either the
finance or foreign portfolio, said Welfare Minister Moshe Katsav of
Likud.
   Likud earlier refused to concede more than the Defense Ministry
to the left-leaning Labor. The turnabout came after Shamir's
negotiations with seven smaller parties bogged down in conflicting
demands for Cabinet posts.
   ``We all believe we should build a government under own
leadership, a government that will lead the country with our
strength,'' Shamir told the ministers, according to a party
statement.
   ``But because we are not only concerned with party interests but
for the country's general welfare, from this standpoint a
broad-based government is preferable,'' Shamir said.
   Labor broke off talks with Likud last week after Likud refused to
reach a power-sharing agreement.
   But Katzav said after today's meeting of Likud leaders: ``Now we
can be more open. We are ready to give two ministries which we were
previously not ready to.''
   The ministers, however, made no decision about what foreign
policy a joint government would have. Israeli news reports said
Likud would insist that Peres be barred from openly advocating an
international Middle East peace conference.
   Labor legislator Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said on army radio the two
parties could find common ground with a proposal for a four-year
autonomy plan for Palestinians in the occupied territories pending
negotiation of a final settlement.
   Ben-Eliezer also said a joint government was needed to break a
lengthy stalemate in Middle East peace contacts. ``Without a
Likud-Labor agreement there are no possibilities for this,'' he said.
   During the election campaign, Peres called for trading land for
peace and negotiating under the umbrella of an international
conference. Shamir rejected any territorial compromise and urged
direct talks aimed at granting the Palestinians limited autonomy.
   In the Nov. 1 elections, Likud edged Labor 40 to 39 in the
120-seat Parliament. The rest went to small parties, with the 18
seats won by ultra-Orthodox religious parties making them possible
kingmakers in a right-wing coaltion.
   Likud's decision today left the door open for the party to form a
government with religious and right-wing factions, the party
statement said.
   Shamir met today with members of four small parties, the Torah
Guardians, Degel Hatorah, Tehiya and the National Religious Party.

   Prince Hitachi, second son of Emperor Hirohito,
canceled celebrations for his 53rd birthday today out of deference
to his ailing father, palace officials said.
   The prince called off a traditional birthday news conference and
tea party. He will celebrate the event with a few family members and
friends, said an official of the Imperial Household Agency.
   Hitachi is fourth in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne after his
older brother, Crown Prince Akihito, and Akihito's two sons.
   Hirohito lay in weakened condition in his chambers at Fukiage
Palace on the 71st day since he fell seriously ill with intestinal
hemorrhaging.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda has said the 87-year-old monarch
sleeps most of the time and rarely speaks. Hirohito also suffers
from anemia and jaundice. Since he underwent abdominal bypass
surgery in September 1987, palace officials have refused to comment
on persistent reports that Hirohito suffers from cancer.

<HEAD>Nixon Memos Reveal Concerns About Press, Wines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon wrote myriad
memoranda while in office on subjects ranging from reporters to the
quality of French wines served at state dinners, according to a new
book.
   Excerpts from ``FROM: The President, Richard Nixon's Secret
Files,'' edited by Bruce Oudes and published by Harper & Row, appear
in People magazine's Dec. 5 issue. They show that Nixon showered his
staff and family alike with memos signed ``The President'' and often
referred to himself as ``RN.''
   After more than a decade of battling to keep some of his memos
from the public, Nixon relented last year and did not object to the
National Archives releasing the majority of the documents.
   Some examples:
   June 16, 1969, to Domestic Affairs Assistant John Ehrlichman:
``On an urgent basis I need the press list before the press
conference on Thursday. I intend to start ... calling on those
pressmen who are not anti rather than constantly calling on those
who are trying to give us the hook.''
   Jan. 9, 1970, to U.S. Information Agency Director Frank
Shakespeare: ``What is the situation with regard to the horrible
modern art in some of our embassies? I realize we can't censor this
stuff, but I would like a report as to what embassies have some of
these atrocious objects.''
   March 16, 1970, to Nixon assistant H.R. Haldeman: ``Would you
please have the Bordeaux years checked? I know that '59 is an
excellent year, even with my unsophisticated taste; but my
recollection is that '66 is one of the poor years. The reason I ask
is that we seem to have a huge stock of '66 Bordeaux on hand, and I
wondered why.''
   June 15, 1971, to Haldeman (marked EYES ONLY): ``In view of The
New York Times irresponsibility and recklessness in deliberately
printing classified documents (the Pentagon Papers) without regard
to the national interest. ... Until further notice under no
circumstances is anyone connected with the White House to give any
interview to ... The New York Times without my express permission. I
want you to enforce this without, of course, showing them this
memorandum.''
   July 24, 1972, to daughters Tricia and Julie: ``It occurs to me
that from time to time you may be asked for anecdotes which would
relate to some of the political events that have occurred over the
years. ... On a personal side, you might mention some of our
Christmas parties when I played the piano for group singing, etc.,
always by ear. ... You can say that these kinds of events are not
publicly known, but they have been part of the Nixon story that is
to you most heartwarming.''
   Memos from Nixon's aides also were among the documents, for
example:
   Feb. 9, 1971, from Haldeman to Nixon deputy Alex Butterfield:
``In seating at State Dinners, the President feels that Henry
(Kissinger) should not always be put next to the most glamorous
woman present.''

   A judicial committee ordered President
Saddam Hussein's eldest son released from jail during an inquiry
into the slaying of one of Hussein's bodyguards.
   Hussein ordered establishment of the judicial committee last
week. He said his 25-year-old son Odai, killed the bodyguard, Kamel
Hana Gegeo, on Oct. 18.
   Odai was jailed three days after the killing. The sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that he was freed Sunday
night.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported the three-man judicial
committee investigating Odai had ordered Sunday that he be freed
without bail on condition he appear for questioning later.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the committee referred the
case to a criminal tribunal.
   Hussein said Odai hit Gegeo with a wooden bat because he refused
to stop shooting at a party near the presidential palace. The
bodyguard died at a hospital several hours later.
   The president said Odai tried to commit suicide after learning of
Gegeo's death. He tried to take his life twice more while in prison,
but was saved by doctors, according to his father.
   Hussein has refused clemency petitions for his son, including one
from the victim's father, who reportedly is the president's cook.
   Also today, the Iraqi News Agency reported Hussein has ordered a
general amnesty pardoning all political prisoners, except spies.
Odai's release was not linked to the amnesty.
   Addressing a group of Arab lawyers gathered for a seminar in
Baghdad, Hussein said today: ``Every convicted political prisoner or
fugitive sought for political reasons is hereby pardoned, be he in
Iraq or abroad, except for those who spied for Iran and its army.''
   He did not say when the prisoners will be freed, nor give the
reason for the amnesty.
   It also was not immediately clear how many prisoners and
fugitives would be affected.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Official's Visit To Soviet Union Not Authorized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Ministry officials said today a visit to
the Soviet Union by its director-general, Avraham Tamir, was not
authorized by the Israeli government.
   Tamir, who arrived in Moscow Sunday to meet with Israel's
consular delegation, is the highest-ranking Israeli to visit the
Soviet Union since the Kremlin cut ties with the Jewish state after
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Tamir's 36-hour visit was not scheduled to include meetings with
Soviet leaders, said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   They said the trip was not cleared with Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres or other government leaders and has provoked angry reactions.
   ``Mr. Peres wasn't happy. He was very surprised,'' one Foreign
Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We
only heard about this visit shortly after Mr. Tamir took off.''
   Tamir was first reported headed for Zaire and Mozambique. But he
turned up in Moscow, traveling on a tourist visa, the Foreign
Ministry officials said.
   ``He apparently thought there was no need to coordinate it
because it was a visit of a technical nature ... but not everyone in
the ministry agreed with this view,'' the official said.
   Another Foreign Ministry source said Tamir's action could put
Israel into an uncomfortable position with the Soviets. ``It could
be quite embarrassing if the Soviets thought the trip was
coordinated,'' the official said.
   He said the feeling in the Foreign Ministry was that Tamir, who
is expected to leave his post shortly, had taken the action to
generate headlines.
   Israel sent a five-member delegation to Moscow in July, a year
after the Soviet Union sent a consular delegation to Tel Aviv.
   The Israeli mission, located in the Dutch Embassy, has been
officially limited to looking after the closed Israeli Embassy
building and processing visas for emigrants and visitors.
   The Soviet mission, located in the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv,
has been handling matters relating to Soviet property, visas and
passports.

<HEAD>Actor John Carradine Dies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines previous. </NOTE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Carradine, the patriarch of an American
acting family who appeared in more than 500 films, has died at age
82, a spokeswoman at a Milan hospital said today.
   The spokeswoman at Fatebenefratelli Hospital, who declined to
give her name, said Carradine died Sunday. She said he had been
hospitalized since Thursday, but she would not disclose the cause of
death.
   She said two of his sons, actors Keith and David, had come to
Milan.
   Tony Renis, an Italian pop singer who said he is a close friend
of David Carradine, called The Associated Press from a Milan hotel
and said, ``David is here with me. He does not want to talk to the
press immediately. He confirms that his father died yesterday in
Milan.''
   Carradine appeared in such classics as ``Stagecoach'' with John
Wayne and ``Grapes of Wrath'' with Henry Fonda. He also played leads
in numerous B-movies, often horror, and portrayed Count Dracula
three times on the screen.
   John Carradine was born Richmond Reed Carradine in New York
City's Greenwich Village on Feb. 5, 1906. His father was an
attorney, poet and printer who become an Associated Press
correspondent in London. His mother was a surgeon.
   As a young man, Carradine hitchhiked his way across America,
drawing sketches of people he met to pay for food, and ended up in
Los Angeles aboard a banana train.
   He became known as a lean character with gaunt features who
strolled Hollywood Boulevard in a velvet suit and cape, reciting
Shakespeare to anyone who would listen. He was known as ``Bard of
the Boulevard.''
   He made his film debut in 1930 with the talkie remake of
``Tol'able David.''
   By 1935, he had changed his name to John Carradine, and his
glorious voice attracted the attention of John Ford and other
directors, making him one of Hollywood's busiest character actors.
   ``I never made big money in Hollywood; I was paid in hundreds,
the stars got thousands,'' he said in a 1986 interview. ``But I
worked with some of the greatest directors in films, and some of the
greatest writers. They gave me freedom to do what I can do best and
that was gratifying.''
   He always returned to Shakespeare, touring the country with his
own company.
   He gave this advice to the four of his five sons who became
actors: ``Read all the Shakespeare you can. If you can play
Shakespeare, you can play anything.''
   His acting sons are David, best known for playing a half-Chinese
priest in the television show ``Kung Fu,'' Robert, Keith, and Bruce.
Only Christopher Carradine, an architect, is not an actor.

<HEAD>Leaders Meet to Review Economic Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's Communist leaders met in
Bucharest today to review the country's economic plans until the
year 2000, the official Agerpres news agency reported.
   The three-day plenary meeting of the Commmunist Party Central
Committee, chaired by leader Nicolae Ceausescu, ``will establish
action for fulfillment of the country's economic and social
development programs, evaluate the current situation in Romania and
specify the political and organizational measures for the future
work of the party,'' the report said.
   Agerpres did not say why the meeting, originally scheduled for
September, was delayed for two months.
   Western observers suggested the delay may have been caused partly
by mounting international criticism of the government's scheme to
destroy thousands of Romanian villages in order to gain more
farmland for state-owned collective farms.
   According to the plan, made public in April, some 7,000 villages
in Romania are to be razed and their residents resettled in new
housing in so-called agro-industrial centers.
   The scheme has met harsh criticism from Western governments and
from neighboring Hungary, which fears the ethnic traditions of 1.7
million ethnic Hungarians in Romania will be destroyed.
   Romanian officials recently have appeared to back off from the
original plan, saying fewer villages would be demolished.
   Another reason for the delay in the meeting may have been
continued food and energy shortages. Western visitors to Romania say
such shortages have worsened in recent months.
   Even bread was hard to find in the capital for a week in July,
Romanians and Western diplomats in Bucharest said.
   Last month, the Communist government announced new energy rations
as the country's population of 23 million prepared for a fifth
straight winter of restrictions and hardships.
   The decree stipulated that centrally controlled heating systems
in the apartment blocks where most urban Romanians live not operate
more than four hours on workdays and five hours on Sundays.
   Over the past four winters, Romanians have experienced drastic
heating and lighting cuts, including daily power cuts lasting from
two to eight hours.

<TEXT>
   A black nationalist leader freed
after 12 years in prison today challenged the government to lift its
ban on his movement and release all jailed activists, including
Nelson Mandela.
   ``Long live the Pan-Africanist Congress'' chanted supporters of
the outlawed organization as Zeph Mothopeng, its ailing 75-year-old
president, arrived for his first news conference since his release
Saturday. The government said it freed him unconditionally on
humanitarian grounds.
   For years, Mothopeng's group has been at odds ideologically with
Mandela's African National Congress. Both organizations use armed
resistance against the white-led government. But the Pan-Africanists
favor black self-reliance, while Mandela's larger organization
supports a multiracial approach.
   Mothopeng took a conciliatory approach. ``My first task, which I
am going to do everything in my powers to discharge, is to unite the
African people,'' he said. ``We don't look at the color of a person
_ we consider his convictions.''
   In calling for the release of all political prisoners, Mothopeng
mentioned Mandela and Jess Masemola, a Pan-Africanist Congress
leader.
   ``I am naming them as symbols of all other prisoners of
conscience who should be out here and working for the return of our
land,'' Mothopeng said. ``They should be released not on the grounds
of compassion or mercy, but because they are held illegitimately.''
   For several months Mothopeng has been seriously ill with cancer,
but he said he would remain politically active.
   ``I issue a direct challenge to (President P.W.) Botha,'' he
said. ``Let him unban the PAC and all other political
organizations.''
   Mothopeng urged foreign governments to intensify economic,
cultural and sporting boycotts of South Africa until the government
made major political concessions. Currently, the black majority has
no vote in national affairs.
   He declined to assess political changes during his imprisonment,
when the government claims many reforms. But he said, ``I am calling
on the international community not to be fooled by cosmetic change.
   ``The only item we are prepared to negotiate is the return of the
land and the wealth to its rightful owners.''
   A former teacher, Mothopeng advised black students to think
carefully about using classroom boycotts as a political tactic.
   ``Use the schools wisely as an arena for the struggle,'' he said,
wishing students good luck in examinations.
   The simultaneous, unconditional releases of Mothopeng and
longtime African National Congress member Harry Gwala, 69, were the
latest in a series of government moves apparently aimed at improving
Pretoria's international standing.
   In the span of a week, the government:
   _ Announced Mandela would not return to prison when he completes
his recovery from tuberculosis at a Cape Town hospital. Officials
said Mandela will remain in custody at a ``suitable'' location,
possibly a private home on prison grounds.
   _ Granted clemency with lengthy jail terms to the Sharpeville
Six, a group of blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984
mob killing.
   _ Endorsed a regional peace plan to grant independence to
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.

   An American Airlines jetliner
carrying 275 people made an emergency landing after a fire alarm
went off, the airline reported today. At least 14 people were
slightly injured.
   American Airlines spokesman Keith Harrell said Flight 1158 took
off from San Juan International airport Sunday at 9:10 p.m. and
returned to the airport 20 minutes later.
   ``The plane received a fire warning and the pilot put the alert
signals and returned. He did what he had to do,'' said Harrell.
   He said the Airbus A300 was examined after the landing and there
was no evidence of a fire. The spokesman said investigators were
trying to determine why the alarm went off.
   Harrell said 14 to 15 people suffered bruises and scratches when
they left the plane by the emergency exit chutes.
   He said the injured were treated at hospitals and released and
that all the passengers later returned to New York.

   Soon, you could swoon to the tune ``Sam'' crooned
for Bogey and Bergman _ right in your own living room.
   The peeling blue-green piano that graced La Belle Aurore Cafe in
the Paris flashback scene in ``Casablanca,'' the instrument whose
ivories tinkled ``As Time Goes By'' to Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey
Bogart, goes on the block at Sotheby's auction house next month.
   The piano, valued at as much as $100,000 for the Dec. 16 sale, is
just 42 inches high and has only 58 keys.
   ``The size of the piano makes you realize how small Humphrey
Bogart was,'' Dana Hawkes, director of the collectibles department
at Sotheby's, said. ``It came up to his waist.''
   The seller is a fan of the 1942 movie who bought the piano from
Warner Bros. The piano was also used in late 1943 in a U.S. Savings
Bond drive which included Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Lucille
Ball.
   Also up for sale is the black hat worn by the Wicked Witch of the
West in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' _ valued at up to $50,000.
   And Clark Gable's leather-bound script from ``Gone with the
Wind'' _ complete with photos of Gable and co-star Vivien Leigh
tucked inside _ is valued at around $4,000.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union today signed an
extension of their long-term grain agreement, providing for the
Soviets to purchase more than 20 million tons of grain and soybeans.
   Ambassador Alan F. Holmer, the deputy U.S. trade representative,
said the agreement extends the grain agreement by two years and
three months _ until the end of 1990. The previous agreement expired
Sept. 30.
   Under the agreement, the Soviet Union is obligated to purchase 4
million metric tons of corn, 4 million metric tons of wheat and 1
million metric tons of corn, wheat or soybeans a year at prevailing
market prices, Holmer said.
   He said those were the same figures included in the previous
agreement.
   The agreement also was announced at a Soviet Foreign Ministry
news briefing by spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   Negotiations on the new agreement began in March in Washington,
and the signing today by Holmer and Soviet Deputy Foreign Economic
Relations Minister Yuri Chumakov concluded the sixth round of talks.
   ``We found the Soviets very business-like and constructive
throughout the negotiations,'' Holmer said by telephone.
   Negotiations will begin at a time not determined yet on an
agreement to follow the new accord, he said.
   The Soviet Union's grain harvest this year, although not
officially announced, is expected to be slightly smaller than the
210 million metric tons harvested in each of the past two years.
   Much of the country's prime grain-growing land was affected by a
severe drought this summer.
   Those figures are much higher than the 1981-1985 annual figure of
about 185 million metric tons, but far below Soviet targets. The
1986 target was 232 million tons and the Soviet Union is trying to
boost production to 250 million metric tons.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to reform
agriculture by giving families and farm workers more responsibility
and the opportunity for greater earnings.
   The Soviet leader hopes to encourage farmers to work harder by
offering them a chance to earn more money and live better.

   Israeli soldiers wounded three Palestinians
today when dozens of masked youths hurled stones at troops in the
West Bank city of Nablus, hospital officials said. A Palestinian
general strike shut down the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The army confirmed two Arabs were wounded.
   More than 300,000 Arabs were confined to their homes under a
curfew aimed at curbing violence during the general strike, Arab
reports and Israel radio said.
   The 6,000 Palestinian residents of the Al-Amari refugee camp in
the West Bank were under curfew for the 10th straight day. Curfews
were reported on eight Gaza Strip refugee camps, parts of Gaza City,
and the West Bank towns of Tulkarem and Qalqilya.
   The army used the strike day for house demolitions, military
officials said.
   Residents of the West Bank village of El-Khadr near Bethlehem
said soldiers had imposed a curfew on the village and were razing
several houses.
   An army official could not confirm the report but said: ``I know
there are house demolitions today. We will have the details later.''
   The army said one house was demolished Sunday in the Gaza Strip
village of Beit Hanoun. It said the house belonged to Yazid Wahi,
who was arrested and accused of leading an outlawed committee and of
taking part in a firebomb attack on Israeli troops.
   The army demolishes Palestinian houses to deter attacks and as
punishment.
   In the west Bank city of Ramallah, pictures of PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat were plastered to walls, and slogans complained of
U.S. Secretary George Shultz's refusal to grant the Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman a visa to address the U.N. General
Assembly.
   ``Shultz, you will never frighten us,'' said one slogan signed by
the PLO.
   ``American is the enemy of all the world,'' said another.
   Two teen-agers and a 20-year-old man suffered bullet wounds in
the clash with soldiers in Nablus, officials at Ittihad hospital in
Nablus said. One of the victims was a 17-year-old shot in the
stomach, they said.
   Stores were closed and public transportation came to a standstill
in response to a call by underground Palestinian leaders to honor
the more than 5,000 Palestinians jailed in the nearly year-old
Palestinian revolt.
   At least 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed during
the uprising, which began Dec. 8.

<TEXT>
   For the second time this month, the Supreme
Court today refused to grant husbands legal power to prevent their
wives from having an abortion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a Michigan man
who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged
wife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down a
companion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus.
   The justices on Nov. 14 declined to hear arguments in a similar
appeal by an Indiana man.
   In the case acted on today, Carlton Lewis attempted to block an
abortion for his then-estranged wife, Shawn.
   She was granted a divorce on Oct. 24. She accused Lewis of
physically abusing her, refusing to contribute financially or
otherwise to the support of the household and abandoning her and the
couple's infant son, Christopher.
   Lewis, 25, a school custodian, went to court last summer to block
Ms. Lewis' from having an abortion after he learned she had become
pregnant during the couple's brief reconciliation last July.
   Court orders barred her from having the abortion for seven weeks
until a Michigan appeals court allowed her to go ahead with the
operation. She had the abortion in October.
   The appeals court cited the Supreme Court's famous 1973 ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide, and a 1976 high
court ruling that struck down a Missouri law requiring spousal
consent for a wife's abortion.
   ``Although the issue of abortion raises important moral
questions, such questions are not applicable to the decision here,''
the appeals court said. Judges ``must apply the law of the United
States Constitution as announced by the United States Supreme
Court.''
   Lawyers for Lewis said the appeals court ruling
``unconstitutionally deprived the father of his unborn child by
sanctioning abortion on demand.''
   The cases are Myers vs. Lewis, 88-555, and Lewis vs. Lewis,
88-683.

   Tony DeVita still clutched his ``tornado
pillow'' hours after killer storms ripped through the Raleigh area
today, killing five people and injuring about 150 others.
   The tornadoes scoured a five-mile path through the heavily
populated northern section of North Carolina's capital city and its
suburbs before leaping to neighboring counties. Along the way, the
tornadoes ripped up DeVita's town house.
   ``It sounded like a rush of water, followed by a bunch of
shaking,'' DeVita said. ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors
were gone and every window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up
like someone was going to replace it.''
   DeVita, 34, grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door. He
still held the pillow during an interview at a shelter in a central
Raleigh school.
   Forty-six people stayed at the shelter after the storms hit
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.
   ``If you felt a big, hot hair dryer blowing by you and the whole
place was shaking apart and if this (pillow) was the only thing that
protected your face, you'd hold onto it,'' DeVita said, calling it
his ``tornado pillow.''
   ``I had to dig my way out'' from the corner of the room, he said.
``I was kind of buried in rubble. In fact, I later found plaster in
my ears.''
   DeVita left his town house wearing only pajamas. He borrowed
clothes from neighbors _ a pink jacket from one, gray sweatpants
from another and socks from someone at the shelter. He still was
without shoes.
   Residents of the complex where he lived were told to evacuate
because of a gas leak. Mayor Avery Upchurch said at midmorning that
the danger of gas leaks had passed.
   DeVita and others weren't allowed to drive out because of the
leak, so they walked and waited for buses to take them to the
shelter.
   Elsewhere, when the sun rose, dazed residents emerged to survey
the destruction.
   ``My God, my God,'' said Ellie Sprankel, as she stood on a ridge
for a sweeping view of her town house subdivision and an adjacent
apartment complex in north Raleigh.
   Ms. Sprankle said she had lived eight years in Illinois and was
accustomed to tornado watches and warnings but had never experienced
one.
   ``They used to tell me it's like a freight train coming, but what
it's really like is a train on top of you,'' she said.
   Carolyn Davis surveyed her two-story town house by candle light
before sunrise. A large pine tree had slammed into her roof and its
top protruded through the ceiling into a bedroom.
   ``My insurance company is going to love this,'' she said. ``One
month, I've been here just one month. I can't believe it.''
   Jerry Thornton gasped in disbelief when he saw that a section of
his town house roof was gone.
   ``I didn't need to see that,'' Thornton said. ``What a way to end
the Thanksgiving weekend.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Jewish Group Display Menorah at Pittsburgh
Building</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let a Jewish
organization display a menorah, symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on
the steps of a Pittsburgh government building next month.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency request
aimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun was the lone vote to allow the display.
   The court agreed in October to decide whether displaying the
menorah at the City-County Building and a Christmas nativity scene
at a nearby government building violate the constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
   That decision is expected by July.
   But lawyers for Chabad, the Jewish organization that owns the
menorah, asked the justices to set aside a federal appeals court's
order that bars its display pending the high court's review.
   The menorah had been displayed each year since 1982.
   The nativity scene depicting the birth of Jesus Christ has been
displayed inside the main entrance of the Allegheny County
Courthouse for about six weeks during the Christmas season since
1981.
   A federal trial judge refused to order the dismantling of the
displays when they were challenged last Christmas. But the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, by a 2-1 vote, that the displays
unlawfully promote religion.
   The nativity scene, or creche, is owned by the Holy Name Society,
a Roman Catholic men's group. It has not sought emergency action
that would allow display of the creche during the Christmas season
this year.
   The Supreme Court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to
include nativity scenes and other religious symbols in officially
sponsored holiday displays.
   In that ruling, the justices let Pawtucket, R.I., officials place
a creche in a Christmas display because such decorations as Santa
Claus, reindeer and snowmen also were included.
   But lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow
one, and have disallowed various government-sponsored Christmas
displays deemed too religious.
   The case is Chabad vs. ACLU, A-384.

<HEAD>Deficit Falls For 3rd Straight Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank by 5.4 percent
from July through September, the third consecutive quarterly
decline, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that the imbalance between imports
and exports narrowed to $28.5 billion in the year's third quarter.
   It was the lowest quarterly deficit since the first quarter of
1985 and reflected the continued improvement the country has enjoyed
in trade this year.
   The decline followed a revised 14.3 percent narrowing in the
second quarter, when it shrank to $30.15 billion. In the first three
months of the year, the deficit had fallen by 14.6 percent.
   For the first nine months of this year, the trade deficit has
been running at an annual rate of $125.2 billion, down 22 percent
from the record deficit of $160.3 billion in 1987.
   Economists believe this trend will hold for the final three
months of the year, marking the first annual improvement in the
country's trade balance since President Reagan took office in 1981.
   The new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in the
department's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures showed
the deficit declining by 3.2 percent to $32.2 billion in the third
quarter, compared to $33.2 billion in the second quarter.
   Today's figures are smaller because they subtract such factors as
shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers.
   The new report said that U.S. exports climbed 3.4 percent to
$82.3 billion. It was the seventh consecutive quarterly increase in
U.S. sales abroad and pushed exports to a record level.
   Imports also rose, but by a smaller 0.9 percent to $110.8 billion
as a drop in oil shipments helped offset a rise in non-petroleum
imports.
   The average number of barrels of oil imported daily rose to 7.54
million, up from 7.4 million. However, the average price of a barrel
of oil fell from $15.16 to $14.22. The price drop helped to narrow
the country's foreign oil bill by 4 percent to $9.9 billion in the
third quarter.
   Offsetting the decline in oil imports were widespread increases
in car shipments.
   Foreign car shipments from Canada climbed by 12 percent while the
number of passenger cars from West Germany increased 34 percent. Car
imports from South Korea were up 29 percent and Japanese shipments
rose 16 percent.
   The average price of a Japanese car edged down by 1 percent while
the price of West German cars dropped a sharp 18 percent after
posting big gains for several quarters.
   Most U.S. export categories showed increases. Sales of farm
produce rose 8 percent to $10.4 billion, the highest level since the
second quarter of 1982.
   The increase was more than accounted for by higher prices,
reflecting the drought in the farm belt.
   Corn exports increased 48 percent and total soybean sales were up
49 percent.
   The average price of corn rose by 30 percent while soybean prices
were up 28 percent and wheat prices rose 25 percent.
   As usual, the largest deficit was recorded with Japan, an
increase of $100 million to $12 billion for the quarter.

<HEAD>Court Allows New York Prosecutors to Use Union Membership Lists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed prosecutors
investigating labor union corruption in New York to use subpoenaed
membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights of
the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to
turn over the lists.
   A Manhattan grand jury in February 1987 issued subpoenas for the
membership lists of Locals 17, 135, 257 and 608 in connection with a
probe of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners by
District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau.
   The New York Court of Appeals ruled last July that Morgenthau's
office could keep the lists pending completion of the grand jury
investigation.
   The state court said forcing the unions to turn over the lists
and allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did not
violate free-association rights of the union and its members.
   The union was forced to turn over the names, addresses, home
telephone and social security numbers for some 10,000 members.
   The state court noted that the investigation is aimed primarily
at high-ranking union officials. But it said some rank and file
members may also become targets.
   ``The membership lists have a substantial relation to the
investigation because they will enable the grand jury to locate and
identify union members, the potential witnesses for grand jury
testimony, without unduly burdening or delaying the search and
without having to proceed through the traditional channels of first
notifying the union leaders and exposing witnesses to possible
intimidation,'' the state court said.
   The state court added that if the subpoenas were narrowed to
include only some union members, job sites or locals it ``would
immediately signal the suspected parties.''
   Also, the state court said, a more restricted subpoena would make
it hard for prosecutors to uncover possible witnesses to illegal
activities, such as bribe-taking.
   The union said the subpoena will chill the rights of members
because carpenters in New York City will assume a connection between
being a union member and being called before the grand jury.
   That perception will deter people from joining the union and
discourage members from attending union meetings and engaging in
robust debate with other members, the union said.
   The Justice Department's Brooklyn-based Organized Crime Strike
Force and the FBI also have been investigating the carpenters union
in a probe begun in 1984 of the construction industry in the New
York metropolitan area. The investigation has produced numerous
indictments charging extortion and payoffs from employers.
   The case acted on today is Local 17 vs. New York, 88-400.

<HEAD>Newspaper: DEA Supervised Fake Drug Seizures, Staged News Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undercover federal drug agents have helped smuggle
drugs and then staged police seizure of the contraband, and have
helped drug manufacturers obtain needed chemicals before arresting
them, newspapers report.
   The staged drug seizures, represented to news reporters as drugs
taken from real smugglers, helped undercover agents gain the
confidence of drug lords by convincing the bosses the loss of the
drugs was legitimate, the Houston Chronical reported Sunday.
   ``The Colombians, the only way they'll believe you is to show
them the stuff (drugs), the money or the newspaper clips,'' Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman Maurice Hill said in Washington.
   The Houston Post reported today that the DEA has given suspected
drug dealers the required chemicals and even built a drug laboratory
for one target.
   Houston attorney Philip Greene told the Post that DEA agents
watched a suspected dealer in Dallas make and deliver
methamphetamines and Quaaludes but did not intercept the drugs. The
dealer, however, was arrested, he said.
   ``If the point of the DEA is to get drugs off the street, they
violated policy,'' said Greene, who specializes in drug cases.
   ``I'm saying our basic goal is to infiltrate drug dealers,'' said
Marion Hambrick, the DEA chief in Houston. ``We can't expose what we
do undercover.''
   The practice of staging fake seizures and feeding the information
to reporters apparently began several years ago to resolve a dilemma
for undercover agents posing as cocaine importers for Colombian drug
lords, the Chronicle reported.
   Often DEA operatives deliver drugs according to instructions from
Colombian exporters, but keep the shipment under surveillance in
hopes of intercepting it before it hits the streets, officials said.
   The DEA sometimes ensures that a shipment of drugs never reaches
the street by ``dropping the load'' in cooperation with local
authorities, who stage phony seizures and allow the undercover
operation to proceed without detection, the newspaper said.
   In 1984, DEA agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into the
country, then abandoned their van at a prearranged Harris County
roadblock set up by the Texas Department of Public Safety. On Aug.
2, 1984, the DPS alerted news reporters that troopers had discovered
a record cache of drugs.
   On Sept. 29 of this year, 60 kilograms of cocaine were planted in
an abandoned car and ``left to be discovered'' by the Harris County
Sheriff's Department, which notified reporters.
   Harris County Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen praised the bogus
seizures as ``very productive in taking illicit drugs off the
street.''
   Because of its success, he said, the practice has gained national
acceptance.
   ``If the DEA is willing to lie to the media and public about this
issue,'' said Houston Chronicle Managing Editor Tony Pederson,
``what else might they be willing to lie about?''
   Pederson acknowledged that extraordinary measures are necessary
to fight drug trafficking, but said government agencies must
maintain credibility.
   Hill said the technique is used in high drug traffic areas
including Florida and Texas.
   ``It's a procedure that is used, but I can't begin to tell you
with what frequency. It's not a new technique, I can tell you
that,'' Hill said.

<HEAD>Welsh Extremist Group Says It Planted London Firebombs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Welsh extremist group claimed responsibility
today for firebomb attacks that damaged five London real estate
agencies.
   ``More attacks will follow unless the English leave Wales,'' a
man claiming to represent the Sons of Glyndower warned in a
telephone call to a national newspaper in Cardiff, the Welsh capital.
   Police said five crude devices which exploded Sunday in London
were pushed through letter boxes at real estate offices in Mayfair,
Chelsea and Notting Hill. One blast extensively damaged Strutt and
Parker's building in Mayfair where a firefighter injured his back
falling through a floor, police said.
   The Sons of Glyndower, named after a Welsh hero, previously
claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on real estate agents
near the Welsh border to protest sales of rural Welsh property to
English buyers.
   The organization says most English buyers are part-time residents
who are not part of the community and only push up house prices,
driving local people out of the market.
   North Wales police have formed a special detective squad to track
the Sons of Glyndower but have made no arrests.

   A man apparently annoyed by a boy making
faces and pointing a toy gun at him from a window got a rifle and
killed the child, state police said.
   Carl Furguson, 31, of Sloansville was charged with second-degree
murder in the death Sunday of 7-year-old John Effner, said Trooper
L.D. Teetz.
   The boy was shot with a .22-caliber rifle at the window of his
home in the Schoharie County hamlet of Howes Cave, about 30 miles
west of Albany, said state police Investigator Joseph Karas.
Furguson had been visiting at the house next door, Karas said.
   Schoharie County District Attorney Michael West said that when
Furguson saw the boy pointing a toy gun at him and making faces, he
``apparently went to his truck, took the rifle out and aimed it at
the boy without checking the chamber to see if there was a bullet
there and fired.''
   Investigators speculated that Furguson did not think the gun was
loaded.
   After the shooting, Furguson fled and was arrested in Guilderland
in Albany County, police said. Furguson was arraigned Sunday and was
held in lieu of $25,000 bail, state police said.

<HEAD>Court Won't Block Retrial in NY Drug, Racketeering Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to block the
retrial of a federal drug and racketeering case against 10 men,
including the brother of reputed New York crime boss John Gotti.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that putting the
defendants on trial again will not violate their double-jeopardy
rights.
   Prosecutors charged the defendants took part in a
multimillion-dollar heroin-smuggling operation.
   Three defendants, Gene Gotti, Angelo Ruggiero and John Carneglia,
have been on trial twice.
   The first time, a mistrial was declared last January after nine
months when the government charged jury tampering. All 10 defendants
were on trial in that case.
   The second trial, involving only Gotti, Ruggiero and Carneglia,
ended in July when the jurors failed to reach a verdict.
   Gotti is the brother of John Gotti, the reputed boss of the
Gambino crime family. Authorities describe Ruggiero as a captain in
the crime syndicate and Carneglia as a member.
   The other defendants are Edward Lino, Mark Reiter, Joseph
LoPresti, Anthony Moscatiello, Oscar Ansourian, Anthony Gurino and
Cesar Gurino.
   The appeal acted on today focused on the first mistrial, declared
by U.S. District Judge Mark A. Constantino after he found evidence
the defendants attempted to identify and influence the jury.
   Constantino dismissed three jurors from the panel on grounds of
bias and then said that left an insufficient number to try the case.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last April that a
retrial would not subject the 10 defendants to double jeopardy in
violation of their rights.
   The appeals court noted that the disqualified jurors denied they
had been approached but said they no longer could be impartial.
   The trial judge ``properly could have concluded that leaving
these individuals on the jury was not a reasonable alternative,''
the appeals court said.
   The appeals court said the judge's finding that there was ``a
distinct possibility'' of jury tampering is enough to warrant a
mistrial.
   The appeals court also said it would be impractical to conduct a
mini-trial to determine whether the allegedly tainted jurors
actually were influenced improperly.
   The case is Ruggiero vs. U.S., 88-374.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact North Dakota Law on Teaching Children at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a North
Dakota law that requires parents who teach their children at home to
be certified by the state.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents who
said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely.
   The North Dakota law was challenged by Lawrence and Deborah
Anderson of Jamestown and Mark and Lynette Dagley of Mandan.
   The couples said they believe that God has given them
responsibility for their children, including their education, and
that sending them to school away from home would violate their
religious convictions.
   The Andersons were fined $1,000 and the Dagleys $500 for
violating the state's compulsory school attendance law.
   North Dakota requires school attendance for children 7 to 16. The
law also requires that religious schools be approved by the state
and that such schools employ teachers who are certified by the state.
   The law permits parents who are certified as teachers to conduct
schools at home for their children.
   The North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the statute last June. It
said North Dakota's ``compelling interest in the education of
children'' permits some restriction on the free exercise of religion.
   The only question is ``whether or not the state has chosen the
least restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest,''
the state court said.
   It said North Dakota could choose another system, such as
authorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring the
children's educational process.
   But the state court said those alternatives might mean a more
intrusive role for the state in supervising the religious training
of children taught at home.
   The Andersons and Dagleys said North Dakota is the only state in
the nation that requires parents who teach their children at home to
be state-certified.
   ``Scientific and educational evidence points unanimously to the
same conclusion _ home-schooled children taught by uncertified
parents are receiving an excellent education,'' they said.
   The parents said a less-restrictive alternative for the state
would be to require parents to disclose at the outset that they are
teaching their children at home and then require the children to
take periodic tests given by public school officials.
   The case is Anderson vs. North Dakota, 88-350.

   A Red Cross official today wound up talks
with Lebanese and Palestinian officials over the fate of a kidnapped
Swiss colleague.
   Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss employee of the Red Cross, was
abducted by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17 in Sidon, 25 miles
south of Beirut. No group has claimed responsibility for the
kidnapping.
   Angelo Gnaedinger, the International Red Cross regional
representative, has been in Lebanon seeking information about
Winkler. He held final talks today with Mustafa Saad, leader of the
Nasserite Popular Organization militia which has controlled Sidon
since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975.
   Saad said after the meeting that Gnaedinger, a Swiss, plans to
fly to Geneva today. Gnaedinger declined to speak to reporters.
   Police in Sidon have suggested Winkler might have been abducted
by some group that is seeking to trade him for Mohammed Ali Hariri,
a 22-year-old Shiite Moslem awaiting trial in Switzerland. Hariri is
charged with murdering a French passenger during the hijacking to
Geneva of an Air Afrique jetliner in July 1987.
   Besides Winkler, 14 foreign hostages are being held in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. Longest held is Terry Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher met Iranian
leaders in Tehran today for talks that West German officials said
would include the issue of the foreign hostages.
   Genscher arrived in Tehran on Sunday.
   A government source in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Genscher would make ``a strong appeal'' to Iranian leaders to
use their influence to win freedom for the hostages.
   Many of the Shiite groups holding foreign hostages are loyal to
Iran.

<HEAD>Second Suspicious Fatal Fire In Two Days Kills Two Women At
Boardinghouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arson is suspected in two weekend fires that
killed six people and sent nine others to hospitals, police said.
   Both fires began on the porches of the buildings, said Deputy
Fire Chief David Norling. The fire Sunday killed two women at a
boardinghouse, and the fire Saturday at a duplex killed four people
and critically injured a fifth person.
   Later Saturday, a third suspicious fire that also began on a
porch damaged a home a few blocks from the duplex, authorities said.
   But Sgt. Tom Skala of the police homicide division said it is not
known whether the blazes were related. Police had no suspects.
   Fourteen people, several of whom were mentally ill, lived at the
boardinghouse in the low-income neighborhood near downtown, said
Mike Harris, its manager.
   Al Bates, who said he owns the boardinghouse, said he was told by
investigators that the fire was caused by flammable liquid spilled
on the front porch of the two-story wooden building and ignited.
   The body of one of the dead women was discovered a few feet from
the front door.
   ``She almost made it,'' said resident Jim Fitzgivens. ``If she
would have gone to the back door, she would have made it, but she
went to where the fire was.''
   He escaped by breaking through a first-floor window.
   ``I couldn't make it another two seconds,'' Fitzgivens said.
``The smoke was so black. I took one inhale of that smoke, and I
knew I would die, so I didn't take another.''
   The two dead women were identified by the Hennepin County medical
examiner's office as Judith Peck, 47, and Patricia Sjorgren, 51, who
lived in the building.
   Eight people were brought to the Hennepin County Medical Center
from the boardinghouse. Two were in serious condition, one in
satsfactory condition and the others were treated and released, the
hospital said.
   Homicide Sgt. Michael LaVine said the duplex fire deaths Saturday
were being investigated as a multiple homicide.
   The medical examiner's office identified the victims as Carol Ann
Kugel, 41; her sons, Don Smith, 22, and Wayne Kugel, 10; and a
family friend, James Jackson, 21.
   All four died from smoke inhalation. Jackson's twin brother,
Joseph, who also was visiting, remained in critical condition at
Hennepin County Medical Center.
   Six people who were downstairs in the wooden duplex escaped
unharmed after a fire alarm sounded, fire officials said.

<HEAD>Indian Remains Re-Buried After Three Years Of Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALLON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of more than 130 ancient Indians
have been reburied after three years of research provided scientists
with new knowledge about pre-historic humans in Nevada.
   The remains showed a record of continuous human occupation of the
Stillwater Marshes for at least 5,000 years, said anthropologists
and archaeologists at the Nevada State Museum in Carson City.
   They said the bones and artifacts also showed that the ancient
Stillwater people were more numerous, less nomadic and healthier
than many scientists originally thought.
   The graves of the people believed to be the ancestors of the
modern-day Paiute Indians were exposed by floods during the
record-wet winters of 1982-84 in the Stillwater Marshes near here.
   The bones were quietly reburied in a private Paiute ceremony
earlier this month at an undisclosed site in the marshes 60 miles
east of Reno.
   Anthropologists were able to identify more than 130 individuals,
the most ever found at a prehistoric site in Nevada, officials said.
   Anan Raymond, archaeologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service at Stillwater, said that gives the site national
significance and makes it one of the most important archaeological
finds in Nevada.
   Sheilagh Brooks, a University of Nevada-Las Vegas anthropologist,
said the 4,000 bones temporarily removed from the marshes could have
represented as many as 416 people. But she said no more than 133
individuals were confirmed since there were too few bones and they
were mixed up.
   Using carbon dating at the University of California-Riverside,
scientists found some bones as old as 3,200 years and some buried as
recently as three centuries ago, Raymond said.
   However, Raymond said the type of artifacts found at the sites,
mainly arrowheads, pushes those dates back ``a couple thousand more
years.''
   Anthropologists were unable to establish a direct genetic link
between the remains and the modern Paiutes, but found ``a lot of
similarity in the skulls and faces,'' Brooks said.
   She said remains of prehistoric Indians found at various
locations in northern Nevada, including Stillwater, are quite
similar to today's Indians, ``big-boned, what we call well-built,
sturdy people, with big noses. They show very little change in
time.''
   Richard Hicks, chairman of the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, said he has
no doubts the remains belong to his ancestors.
   The tribe still was burying some of its dead in the marshes as
late as the 1930s, he said. ``Some of us in our 50s can remember
that when we were little guys, they would take them back out that
way, toward the desert.''
   The marsh also yielded house foundations, hearths, roasting pits,
food storage pits, garbage heaps and extensive stone tools.
   ``This is not a burial site, per se, but a bigger picture: a
place where people lived, hunted and fished and buried their
kinsmen,'' Raymond said.

   Tornadoes today ripped through a department
store, destroyed mobile homes and churches and damaged apartment
buildings, killing five people and injuring more than 143 others,
authorities said.
   Three of the deaths, including an 11-year-old boy, were in Wake
County, which includes Raleigh, and the others were in neighboring
Nash County, officials said.
   Gov. Jim Martin said three storm systems hit the state and at
least 15 tornado touchdowns were reported in seven counties. In
north Raleigh, tornadoes raked a path through a five-mile area. Four
three-story apartment buildings and a department store were
flattened.
   ``I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and
then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought, `Oh God, this is
it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said Betty Bell
of Raleigh, who was in bed when a tornado hit.
   Tony DeVita, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex said he grabbed a
pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed.
   ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every
window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going
to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the
corner of the room.
   Raleigh City Manager Dempsey Benton Jr. said 62 people were taken
to hospitals in Wake County, including three who required surgery.
At least nine houses were destroyed and 44 damaged, he said.
   Benton said city officials received no warning from the National
Weather Service about the possibility of tornadoes. ``We did not
have a tornado watch nor warning before the storm struck,'' he said.
   He and Raleigh Mayor Avery Upchurch flew over the affected area
today and Upchurch said, ``It looked like a big bouncing ball had
gone through there.''
   Roger Friedenson of the Insurance News Service said it appeared
that damages could be as serious as tornadoes that struck
southeastern North Carolina in 1984 and caused about $65 million in
damage. City officials said 500 people were homeless.
   Martin, at a 6 a.m. briefing, said six people had died, but
later, officials said one of those deaths was not storm-related.
Officials at the state Division of Emergency Management said 143
people were taken to hospitals. Uncounted others were treated for
minor injuries.
   The tornadoes first struck Raleigh around 1:15 a.m., Benton said.
City buses transported more than 300 people to two shelters, he said.
   Later in the morning, the storms moved into eastern Virginia,
pushing over trees and bringing heavy wind and rain, the weather
service said. A tornado warning there expired at 6 a.m.
   The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down near
Windsor, Va., cutting power to much of the area. There were reports
of damage to mobile homes, but no injuries were reported.
   Power outages were widespread in North Carolina, authorities said.
   ``We've had churches that have been demolished, some trailers and
some homes,'' said Franklin County Sheriff Arthur E. Johnson, who
added that Red Cross personnel were on their way.
   In northern Raleigh, a K mart store was flattened, and three
people were trapped inside, said police Sgt. J.D. Everett. All three
were rescued, but one man suffered a broken leg, said Assistant Fire
Chief Robert Whittington.
   Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap
with racks of clothing and other merchandise.
   Police dispatched officers to nearby neighborhoods to look for
people in need of help and to prevent looting.
   ``It appears that we've got extensive damage all over the area,''
Everett said. ``We do have some extensive injuries, but I can't tell
you how many, or who, or where.''
   In addition to the flattened apartment buildings, numerous others
suffered structural damages, said Deirdre Bolling, manager of the
Cooper's Pond complex. No one in those buildings was seriously hurt,
and residents were given lodging at hotels, she said.
   The first rescue workers on the scene there pulled people from
third-floor windows. Several residents wandered around dazed, with
visible cuts. One man wore only a bath towel.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact System for Giving Congress Members Pay Raises</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 20-30, In other action, with other cases</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact the current
system for giving members of Congress pay raises.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the process _
which produced a $12,000 congressional pay raise last year _ gives
too much power to the president to determine salary levels.
   The justices also declined to use the case to examine what power
members of Congress have to challenge the constitutionality of
federal laws.
   The system for approving congressional pay hikes, established by
a 1967 law, was challenged by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and five
Republican House members after congressional pay was raised $12,000
last year to $89,500.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the pay-raise
system last May 31.
   The system also controls salary increases for federal judges and
high-ranking executive branch officials. But the challengers to the
law did not attack those provisions.
   The appeals court said the system is constitutional because it
allows Congress to override salary increases granted by the
president.
   From the founding of the nation until 1967, Congress passed
legislation to set its salary scale.
   Seeking to share the responsibility for giving itself pay raises,
Congress passed the Federal Salary Act in 1967.
   The law calls for convening every four years a salary study
commission appointed by all three branches of government. The
commission makes a recommendation to the president, who then submits
his pay plan to Congress.
   The president's recommendations become effective unless Congress
disapproves them within 30 days of receiving them.
   The act was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses to
override the president's recommendations. The original law permitted
either house to veto a pay hike. But the so-called legislative veto
was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1983.
   The appeals court here said the elimination of the legislative
veto causes ``marginally increased practical difficulty'' for
Congress to override a presidential recommendation.
   But the fact remains, the appeals court said, ``Congress is
afforded the opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all
of the president's recommendations before they go into effect.''
   The appeals court also rejected the challenge to the pay-hike
statute on independent grounds. It said federal courts have an
obligation not to rule in disputes where Congress has the power to
remedy the problem itself.
   The court also rejected an argument that delegating a role to the
president in setting congressional salaries violates the
constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of
government.
   Challenging the law along with Humphrey were Reps. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Beau Boulter, R-Texas; Jack Davis,
R-Ill.; and Clyde Holloway, R-La.
   They were joined by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and the
National Taxpayers Union.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to uphold the
pay-raise system.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Refused to let a Jewish organization display a menorah,
symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a Pittsburgh
government building next month.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency request
aimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah.
   _ Agreed to referee an important railroad industry dispute
affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and
reduce their work forces.
   The court said it will use appeals involving the small Pittsburgh
& Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issues
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.
   _ For the second time this month refused to grant husbands legal
power to prevent their wives from having an abortion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a Michigan man
who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged
wife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down a
companion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus.
   _ Allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in New
York to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four
carpenters union locals.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights of
the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to
turn over the lists.
   _ Left intact a North Dakota law that requires parents who teach
their children at home to be certified by the state.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents who
said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely.
   The congressional pay-raise case is Humphrey vs. Brady, 88-352.

   A couple accused of taking a premature
baby from a hospital were arrested after they showed off the infant
to relatives who became suspicious and called police, authorities
said.
   Sharon and Robert Newkirk were arrested Saturday on charges of
kidnapping 2{-month-old Debra Lynn Moore on Friday evening from her
crib at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. They were to be
arraigned later today.
   The Newkirks on Friday took a child to the home of Robert
Newkirk's sister and brother-in-law, Judy and Gerald Edmundson.
   ``Robert was so excited,'' Judy Edmundson said. ``He held her and
said, `Daddy loves you.'''
   But in retrospect, ``We had a funny feeling about it,'' Gerald
Edmundson said. ``The next day, we heard the report on the news that
a baby had been kidnapped. We put two and two together.''
   Police picked up the Newkirks as they pulled into the driveway of
their home in Howell, about 20 miles away. Police said they found
the baby in the couple's car.
   The baby was returned to C.S. Mott, where her twin brother also
is a patient, and was listed in good condition.
   Police Sgt. Jim Tieman said authorities did not know a motive for
the abduction.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker is likely to be
indicted by a federal grand jury investigating how the ministry's
leaders raised and spent millions of dollars in contributions, his
attorney said.
   ``It's a question of when, and what the particular allegations
will be,'' lawyer Jim Toms said.
   The 23-member grand jury reconvened this morning in Charlotte.
   Toms said Friday that the indictment is likely to come the week
of Dec. 12.
   Bakker, who resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after the
revelation that he had a tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn
and paid her hush money, has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and has
called the investigation ``a fishing expedition.''
   Three months ago he predicted, ``I don't think I'll be indicted.
I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.''
   Charles Alexander, the federal prosecutor handling the
16-month-old investigation, wrote Bakker and at least two of his
former associates last month informing them that they were targets
of the probe and inviting them to appear before the grand jury this
week, The Charlotte Observer reported.
   Toms said he has had several telephone conversations with
Alexander, and his expectation that Bakker will be indicted is
``just my impression based on my experience and the conversations. I
think that's consistent with the kind of talk he's (Alexander) given
me.''
   Bakker is preaching at his new church, New Covenant Church, in
Charlotte.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said today the
United States violated international law by denying him a visa to
address the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   He said Jordan will seek to move the U.N. session to Geneva or
Vienna for the debate on the Palestinian issue.
   He said the United States committed ``a grave violation of the
1947 headquarters treaty with the U.N.'' by rejecting his visa
application.
   Arafat spoke to reporters after arriving from Amman, Jordan,
where he met with King Hussein. Baghdad is the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military headquarters.
   ``Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and
explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' Arafat said of U.S.
officials.
   He called rejection of the visa ``a sheer violation of the
international law and the U.N. charter.'' He maintained the Reagan
administration was ignoring international backing for the newly
proclaimed state of Palestine.
   More than 30 governments have declared support for the
independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories
declared Nov. 15 by the Palestine National Council.
   The PLO leader said Secretary of State George Shultz rejected the
visa application in response to an Israali request.
   Shultz said Saturday the United States had rejected Arafat's visa
application. He accused Arafat of being ``an accessory to
terrorism'' by ``PLO elements.''
   The PLO leader said his U.N. speech is being drafted by a special
committee but declined to say whether it will contain any new
initiatives or proposals.
   Arafat described the Palestine National Council decisions to
implicitly recognize Israel by endorsing United Nations Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338 and renounce international terrorism
as ``the last chance for peace'' in the Middle East.
   He said that if the initiative failed to win a response from the
United States, he may call another council meeting to review
Palestinian policy.

   A leading Soviet chess player who
secretly married the U.S. chess team captain and defected during the
Chess Olympiad was in Frankfurt with her husband today awaiting a
U.S. visa, a U.S. official said.
   Elena Akhmilovskaya, the second-ranked player on the Soviet team,
married John Donaldson, the U.S. team's non-playing captain, in
Greece on Friday during the Olympiad.
   The couple flew Saturday to Frankfurt after a secret wedding in
Salonica's town hall.
   ``They have initiated the process for obtaining an immigrant visa
for Mrs. Donaldson,'' U.S. Consulate spokesman Craig Springer told
The Associated Press.
   He said the couple were expected to spend several days in
Frankfurt waiting for the visa. They asked consular officials not to
disclose where they were staying.
   Donaldson, a 31-year-old international master from Seattle, met
Akhmilovskaya during a chess competition in Cuba in 1985.
   Apparently fearing the reaction of Soviet team officials, the
couple decided to leave Greece before the Olympiad ended after news
of their wedding started becoming public.
   ``They had to leave quicker than they had planned,'' said
Donaldson's father, William, in Philadelphia. ``The story (of the
marriage) got leaked and they were worried about her being able to
come to America.''

   Killer tornadoes swept through North Carolina today, destroying
churches and homes and killing five people, and a blizzard in
Minnesota halted thousands of holiday travelers, stranding many of
them in small towns overnight.
   The tornadoes left at least 143 people injured, officials said.
Raleigh City Manager Dempsey Benton Jr. said nine houses were
destroyed and 44 damaged.
   Gov. Jim Martin said 15 tornado touchdowns were reported in seven
counties. The last tornado strikes were near Bayboro in Pamlico
County and near Manteo in Dare County, both on the Atlantic Coast.
   ``It was like a train, like you hear people say. It was like a
jet coming down too low,'' said Lisa Lanier, who lives at a Raleigh
apartment complex struck by a tornado.
   Later in the morning, the storms moved into eastern Virginia,
pushing over trees and bringing heavy wind and rain, and a tornado
near Windsor cut power to much of the area, the National Weather
Service said.
   In the southern Minnesota town of Jackson, with a population of
4,000, at least 2,000 motorists stranded by snowstorms spent part of
the night in a National Guard Armory, a school, four churches and
many private homes, said Police Chief Richard Seim.
   At Rothsay, Minn., a 50th wedding anniversary celebration at
Hamar Lutheran Church was canceled because of the weather and the
family donated the food to 250 stranded motorists, said Pastor Paul
Magelssen.
   At least 500 people waited out the storm at the Jackson Best
Western motel in the lobby, coffee shop, dining room and lounge,
said manager Darrell Gilbert.
   Snow blasted by wind gusting to 70 mph cut visibility to 100 feet
at times Sunday in Morris, where the University of Minnesota-Morris
was closed today.
   The Minnesota State Patrol closed 80 miles of Interstate 90 from
the South Dakota border to Fairmont in southwestern Minnesota during
Sunday afternoon because of whiteout conditions and a 20-mile
section of eastbound I-94 from Fergus Falls to Rothsay in western
Minnesota following multicar pileups. The patrol reopened I-94
Sunday evening but I-90 remained closed until early today.
   On the blocked section of I-94, it was ``one big accident with
more than 100 cars involved,'' said patrol Lt. Wes Geve. No injuries
were reported.
   Most people resumed travel late Sunday night and early today
after the wind dropped to 10 mph, said dispatcher Denny Vollan at
the state highway office in Windom.
   The 1,000 people sheltered at the armory in Jackson left in
groups during the night as conditions improved, and the last two
cars left before 8 a.m., said Staff Sgt. Jeff Gay. Most of the 500
to 600 people stranded at the high school in Sherburn left late
Sunday, head cook Dorothy Miller said today.
   The snowstorm that began Saturday in Minnesota dumped up to 16
inches of snow at Aitkin. An accident Saturday that killed an
Illinois man was blamed on ice and poor visibility.
   There were snowdrifts 5 feet high in Rothsay, residents said.
Blizzard conditions and near-blizzard conditions were present in
some southwestern and central Minnesota communities, Harrison said.
   Temperatures dipped into the teens and winds gusted to 35 mph
over much of the state, lowering wind-chill readings to minus 30 in
some areas, he said.
   Patti O'Leary, of suburban Minneapolis, was traveling home with
her daughter after visiting her parents for Thanksgiving in Fargo,
N.D., and ended up at the church in Rothsay.
   ``There was a semi in the ditch on my right, a semi in the ditch
on my left and that was enough for me,'' O'Leary said. ``I went to
the gas station and they said the church was open so I thought that
is where I'm going and that is where I'm staying until it's clear to
go.''
   Elsewhere, a snowstorm in Utah that began Friday night dropped up
to 50 inches at the Alta Ski Resort east of Salt Lake City. The
storm caused numerous traffic accidents, including a collision that
killed a 21-year-old Brigham City man.
   In California, dense fog at Fresno's airport forced a Delta Air
Lines jetliner with 137 people aboard to be diverted for refueling
at Edwards Air Force Base, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
   In Florida, a small plane flying into stormy weather with
apparent engine trouble broke apart as it crashed Sunday into a
swamp in the Panhandle, killing all four aboard, officials and
witnesses said.
   In Texas, a man was killed Saturday and another injured when
their single-engine airplane plunged into a house in fog in Port
Lavaca, authorities said. Two people in the house were not injured.
   In the small northern Mississippi town of Ruleville, Gov. Ray
Mabus declared a state of emergency Sunday, a day after a tornado
destroyed four homes and damaged at least 38 others as well as three
schools.

   OPEC oil ministers today approved a new
production accord that will sharply cut their output and raise crude
oil prices.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, emerged from a session
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and said the
deal was formally completed.
   All 13 members of the cartel signed the accord, which sets a
target price of $18 a barrel although crude has been selling at $14
a barrel and less.
   Analysts have said the agreement, which goes into effect Jan. 1
and runs for six months, could send crude prices climbing by $1 or
$2 a barrel.
   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an
increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although
oil companies do not always pass along the full increase.
   The agreement sets the cartel's total production at 18.5 million
barrels a day in the first six months of the year. It currently is
running at 22.5 million barrels a day.
   The ministers' aim is to curtail their production in an effort to
reduce the glut on the market and lift sagging prices.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said the accord would have a
``positive, very positive'' effect on the oil market and predicted
prices could reach $18 a barrel ``maybe by June.''
   If all 13 countries curb their production as provided under the
accord, prices will get a strong lift, he said.
   ``It's a hell of a lot of oil to take out of the market,'' he
said. ``It should shock the price sharply up very quickly.''
   Saudi Arabia had tried to set a minimum price of $15 in the
accord, but that effort met resistance.
   Nazer said late Sunday the Saudi proposal was designed to prevent
prices from falling below $15. But other ministers said the minimum
price could become the ceiling price.
   Barkeshli said Sunday the Saudi proposal was ``a major divergence
from OPEC resolutions so far'' and could ``totally sabotage the
agreement.''
   ``Iran is not going to accept this type of idea,'' he said.
   Under the accord, each country would be given a production quota,
or ceiling, within the total limit of 18.5 million barrels a day.
   Many OPEC countries need more money from their oil sales. Iran
and Iraq want additional revenues to rebuild their economies, which
were badly damaged in their eight-year war. They agreed to an August
cease-fire.
   Under the new agreement, Iran and Iraq each will get the same
quota of 2.64 million barrels a day.
   Iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with Iran,
which repeatedly said no.
   Under the new accord, Iran will retain its production share at
14.27 percent of the cartel's total output. Other countries would
give up some of their share to bring Iraq up to the same level as
Iran.
   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter of
OPEC's total output.
   Under the current accord, Iran has a cap of 2.4 million barrels a
day. Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels but ignored it.
Analysts estimate its production at 2.7 million barrels a day.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,
and Venezuela.

   Prince Ludwig Rudolf of Hanover, the
32-year-old great-grandson of Germany's last emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm
II, took his own life today after his wife apparently died of a drug
overdose, police said.
   Isabelle of Hanover, 26, was found dead by her husband in the
so-called Queen's Villa at Gmunden, a lakeside resort in Upper
Austria.
   A spokesman for Upper Austria security police who asked not to be
identified said the Austrian-born woman died of lung and brain
edema. He said her death was most likely caused by a drug overdose.
The type of drug was not identified.
   The prince was found shot to death in a wooded area some 20 miles
from Gmunden on Lake Traunsee, the police spokesman said. His
hunting rifle was beside him, police said.
   The couple married in October 1987. They are survived by an
8-month-old son.
   In West Germany, the secretariat of the dead nobleman's brother,
the Prince of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick and Luneburg, said in a
statement that Isabelle died of a circulatory failure caused by
taking ``too strong medication.''
   ``In shock due to the sudden death of his wife, my brother, His
Royal Highness Prince Ludwig Rudolf of Hanover, thereafter took his
life,'' the statement said.
   The villa where Isabelle of Hanover died is a favorite meeting
place of European aristocracy.
   At 2:45 a.m. today, Ludwig Rudolf informed the Red Cross in
Gmunden of his wife's apparent death, the police spokesman said.
   When a Red Cross physician arrived, the prince had vanished, the
police spokesman said. His dead wife was found in her bedroom.
   Police said after making the telephone call, the prince took his
hunting rifle and drove away. His body was found at 6:30 a.m. with a
bullet wound to the head. Police ruled out involvement by another
person.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISES
   
   The court left intact the current system for giving members of
Congress pay raises.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that the
process _ which produced a $12,000 congressional pay raise last year
_ gives too much power to the president to determine salary levels.
   The justices also declined to use the case to examine what power
members of Congress have to challenge the constitutionality of
federal laws.
   The case is Humphrey vs. Brady, 88-352.
   
   MENORAH
   
   The court refused to let a Jewish organization display a menorah,
symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a Pittsburgh
government building next month.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency request
aimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah.
   The case is Chabad vs. ACLU, A-384.
   
   RAILROADS
   
   The court agreed to referee an important railroad industry
dispute affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines
and reduce their work forces.
   The court said it will use appeals involving the small Pittsburgh
& Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issues
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.
   The cases are Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Co. vs. Railway
Labor Executives, 87-1589, P&LE Railroad vs. RLE, 87-1888, and RLE
vs. C&NW, 88-464.
   
   ABORTION
   
   The court, for the second time this month, refused to grant
husbands legal power to prevent their wives from having an abortion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a Michigan man
who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged
wife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down a
companion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus.
   The cases are Myers vs. Lewis, 88-555, and Lewis vs. Lewis,
88-683.
   
   CARPENTERS
   
   The court allowed prosecutors investigating labor union
corruption in New York to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained
from four carpenters union locals.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights of
the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to
turn over the lists.
   The case acted on today is Local 17 vs. New York, 88-400.
   
   HOME SCHOOLS
   
   The court left intact a North Dakota law that requires parents
who teach their children at home to be certified by the state.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents who
said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely.
   The case is Anderson vs. North Dakota, 88-350.

   U.S. Sen. Quentin Burdick was undergoing tests
today in a hospital where he was taken by ambulance after
complaining he was not feeling well, an aide said.
   Burdick, 80, was admitted to St. Luke's Hospitals about 10 p.m.
Sunday, said Tom Stallman, an assistant in the senator's Fargo
office.
   He ``was admitted for evaluation following complaints of not
feeling well,'' according to a statement read by Stallman. ``The
senator will undergo tests today. Senator Burdick is alert and had
improved since admission and his condition is stable.''
   Burdick was conscious when he was taken to the hospital, Stallman
said.
   The aide said he had no other information. The hospital staff
referred callers to the senator's staff.
   Burdick had a portion of his colon removed in August at Bethesda
Naval Hospital in Maryland because of cancer and was hospitalized in
Fargo a year ago after slipping on ice and hurting his head.
   A Democrat, he was re-elected to the Senate on Nov. 8.

   The shooting spree began in front of the disco early Sunday when

   Police chased Caille to the front of his apartment, where he shot
and seriously wounded a 20-year-old bystander. Caille finally turned
the gun on himself, and he died shortly after being admitted to the

<HEAD>Freed Black Leader Dares Botha to Remove Bans on Opposition Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A black nationalist leader freed
after 12 years in prison Monday challenged the government to
legalize outlawed black opposition groups.
   Zeph Mothopeng also urged blacks to unite, and he called for
freedom of all jailed activists, including his rival Nelson Mandela.
   ``Long Live The Pan-Africanist Congress!'' supporters chanted as
the ailing 75-year-old president of the banned organization arrived
for a news conference. It was his first public appearance since 1976.
   The government said it freed him unconditionally Saturday for
humanitarian reasons.
   For years, followers of Mothopeng's group have been at
ideological odds with Mandela's African National Congress. Both
organizations train guerrillas to fight white-minority domination.
But the Pan-Africanists favor black self-reliance, while the larger
African National Congress supports a multiracial approach.
   Mothopeng, who quit the ANC in 1959, adopted a conciliatory tone
Monday.
   ``My first task, which I am going to do everything in my powers
to discharge, is to unite the African people,'' he said. ``We don't
look at the color of a person _ we consider his convictions.''
   In calling for the release of jailed activists, Mothopeng named
Mandela and fellow Pan-Africanist leader Jess Masemola ``as symbols
of all other prisoners of conscience who should be out here and
working for the return of our land.''
   ``They should be released not on the grounds of compassion or
mercy but because they are held illegitimately,'' he said.
   Mothopeng has been seriously ill for months with cancer of the
thymus gland, but he said he would remain active politically.
   ``I issue a direct challenge to (President P.W.) Botha,'' he
said. ``Let him unban the PAC and all other political
organizations.''
   Mothopeng urged foreign countries to intensify economic, cultural
and sporting boycotts of South Africa until the government made
major political concessions. Currently, the black majority has no
vote in national affairs.
   He declined to assess political changes during his imprisonment,
when the government claimed significant reforms. But Mothopeng
warned: ``I am calling on the international community not to be
fooled by cosmetic change.
   ``The only item we are prepared to negotiate is the return of the
land and the wealth to its rightful owners,'' he said.
   A former teacher, Mothopeng cautioned black students to think
carefully about classroom boycotts as a political tactic. ``Use the
schools wisely as an arena for the struggle,'' he said, wishing them
good luck in examinations.
   The simultaneous, unconditional releases of Mothopeng and
longtime ANC member Harry Gwala, 69, were the latest in a series of
government moves aimed partly at improving its international
standing.
   In the span of a week, the government:
   _ Announced Mandela would not return to prison when he completes
his recovery from tuberculosis but will remain in custody at an
unspecified location.
   _ Reprieved with lengthy jail terms the Sharpeville Six blacks
sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984 mob killing.
   _ Endorsed a regional peace plan to grant independence to
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.

   New CBS programming executive Barbara Corday
hopes to bring the network out of the ratings cellar by appealing to
a younger audience.
   ``A lot of producers think of CBS as a lot older and a lot more
rural than it actually is,'' said Ms. Corday, the new vice-president
in charge of prime-time entertainment. ``But CBS has begun to turn
around a little bit in the areas of slightly younger, slightly more
upscale, more female-oriented shows.''
   Among the new projects is a series based on the hit Tom Hanks
movie ``Big.''
   It's too early to tell whether this new network attitude will
help make CBS competitive. Ms. Corday, 43, former president of
Columbia@Embassy Television and co-creator of the Emmy-winning
``Cagney and Lacey,'' came on board too late to influence this
season's shows.

   Important matters of state were not always
uppermost in the mind of former President Richard M. Nixon.
   The glamour of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's dinner
partners and the quality of the White House's wine cellar also
concerned Nixon, according to a new book.
   Excerpts from ``FROM: The President, Richard Nixon's Secret
Files,'' edited by Bruce Oudes and published by Harper & Row, appear
in People magazine's Dec. 5 issue.
   The memos show Nixon was particularly concerned about the press.
After the publication of the Pentagon Papers, he told his assistant
H.R. Haldeman to make sure no one spoke to the New York Times
without the president's permission.
   But Nixon had other interests as well.
   In a March 1970 memo, he asked Haldeman: ``Would you please have
the Bordeaux years checked? I know that '59 is an excellent year,
even with my unsophisticated taste; but my recollection is that '66
is one of the poor years. The reason I ask is that we seem to have a
huge stock of '66 Bordeaux on hand, and I wondered why.''
   Memos from Nixon's aides revealed even the attractiveness of
Kissinger's dinner companions did not escape the former president's
notice.
   A Feb. 1971 message from Haldeman to Nixon deputy Alex
Butterfield stated, ``In seating at State Dinners, the President
feels that Henry (Kissinger) should not always be put next to the
most glamorous woman present.''

   Gospel singer Amy Grant had helped build
several Habitat for Humanity homes, but until this weekend she had
never seen the finished product.
   ``It takes it a lot closer to the bone,'' said Ms. Grant after a
Sunday visit to Americus, headquarters for the agency that helps
build houses for low-income families. ``It really comes alive when
you actually see it and the people whose lives it has changed.''
   Habitat for Humanity, founded by Millard Fuller and Clarence
Jordan, is an ecumenical housing agency that has provided more than
4,000 homes since 1966.
   During her 1988 tour, Ms. Grant promoted the the agency's work.
She also has helped local Habitat workers build homes in Cleveland
and Rochester, N.Y.
   During Sunday's visit to a 50-house project in Americus, 90 miles
south of Atlanta, Ms. Grant watched Lillie Mae Bowen hug Fuller and
say, ``I have to thank the good Lord and this man right here for
this home.''
   ``In a selfish world it's good to see that something like this
can happen,'' said Ms. Grant's husband, Gary Chapman.

   The nation's biggest banks raised their prime
lending rates a half percentage point to 10.5 percent today, the
fourth increase this year.
   The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate
to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half
percentage point to 10 percent.
   Chase Manhattan was the first institution to announce the hike,
with several other major banks joining the move, including Citibank,
Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Bankers Trust and
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
   Reaction in the financial markets was restrained. At noon on Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.33 points to
2,069.35, while bond prices were mixed. The dollar initially rose in
foreign exchange trading, but quickly retreated.
   Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady
increase of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks.
   ``It comes as no surpise given the rise in short-term rates,''
said William V. Sullivan, economist for the investment firm Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Sullivan said there also was ``building perception in the
marketplace'' that the Federal Reserve might push rates even further
by raising its discount rate, or the interest charged to member
banks for loans, to support the dollar.
   Concerns about the growing federal budget and trade deficits have
pushed the dollar sharply lower against most major currencies in
recent weeks.
   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money and
trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.
   But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types
of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular
home-equity loans.
   ``It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing
costs in December or early next year,'' said Sullivan.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush announced today
that White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater would remain in his post
in the new administration.
   Bush said he selected Fitzwater because ``I think he's the best.''
   His appointment marked the latest in a series of high-level
holdovers from the old administration to the new. But Bush promised
fresh faces for his turn in the Oval Office, telling reporters,
``Stay tuned for the changes.''
   Fitzwater, a stocky, balding 46-year-old career government
spokesman _ who worked for Bush before becoming President Reagan's
spokesman _ said the incoming president would hold news conferences
``as much as possible. They should be as regular as possible.''
   Bush, after his announcement, went to a private lunch with former
GOP primary rival Bob Dole, R-Kan., whose help he will need in the
new Congress.
   ``The election is over. I vowed to the president-elect we'd work
together,'' Dole said as the two began their meeting in Bush's suite
in the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House.
``There's a lot of work to do. That's the way it works.''
   For his part, Bush said that with the campaign now past, ``the
focus is properly on the future.''
   Bush announced the selection of his press spokesman in an
appearance in the White House briefing room from the podium where
Fitzwater stands daily to answer questions about Reagan
administration policy, personnel and controversies.
   Bush said he had asked Fitzwater ``to remain as press
secretary,'' the title the president's chief spokesman usually has.
   Although Fitzwater has been Reagan's main spokesman, he has had
the title of assistant to the president for press relations. James
Brady, who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt on the
president in March 1981, has kept the title of press secretary.
   When asked whether Brady would have a role in the new
administration, Fitzwater said, ``I know the vice president is very
interested in Jim and concerned about his well being and has raised
the question internally.''
   ``I think they have some ideas of things they would like him to
do, but haven't fleshed them out,'' he said. ``I would recommend we
sit down with Sarah (Brady's wife) and Jim and see what their plans
are,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president-elect said he had no other announcements to make
during the day, despite speculation that he soon would appoint
former Sen. John Tower as defense secretary and name longtime
associate Robert Mosbacher to head the Commerce Department.
   He said of Fitzwater: ``He represents the old and the new ... the
Reagan administration and also the Bush administration.''
   The president-elect added, ``We'll have a lot of changes as I
said. This is continuity in the best sense.''
   Other high-level holdovers from the Reagan administration include
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. Also, James Baker III, who
served as Reagan's chief of staff and then treasury secretary, will
be Bush's secretary of state.
   At the beginning of his meeting with Dole, Bush indicated he
wasn't expecting an easy time on Capitol Hill. Mentioning the budget
deficit specifically, Bush said, ``As we start, there are going to
be some problems. There are plenty of problems out there.''
   He said he intended to work with both Republicans and Democrats
in Congress in forging solutions to those problems. ``That's exactly
the spirit that this end of Pennsylvania Avenue is going to have,''
Bush said.
   He said Richard Darman, his choice for budget director, would be
joining them at the lunch meeting to discuss budget issues.
   Fitzwater is a longtime government spokesman whose resume
includes stints at the Treasury Department and Bush's vice
presidential office. He left Bush's staff in February 1987 to become
Reagan's White House spokesman.
   He said was contacted by the vice president at 8:30 a.m. today.
``He made the offer and I quickly accepted,'' Fitzwater said.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary during the transition period,
will remain in that job until Jan. 20, Fitzwater said.
   When reporters bombarded him with questions, he joked: ``A two
minute honeymoon. Amazing.''
   He promised frequent contact with reporters. ``I love to brief. I
brief every day. The vice president has been holding press
conferences at the rate of one every five hours.''
   The announcement came after Bush returned from his Thanksgiving
Holiday vacation at his family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, and
marked the beginning of a busy period for the president-elect.
   In addition to his meeting with Dole later in the day, he
arranged a session with all Senate Republicans for Tuesday in the
Capitol. He also is expected to continue working on assembling his
new team, and is traveling to the United Nations next week to
participate in meetings between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Although Dole endorsed Bush after being overwhelmed by the vice
president in last winter's GOP primaries, the two have had little
contact since then.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart said the meeting was arranged by Bush
but that both men had wanted it for some time. ``It's of mutual
interest,'' Hart said.
   Bush already has met with House Speaker Jim Wright and has
promised a meeting with the new Senate Democratic leader as soon as
he is chosen.
   The president-elect will join Reagan for a Dec. 7 luncheon with
Gorbachev in New York during the Soviet leader's visit to address
the United Nations.
   In his campaign, Bush urged wariness in U.S. dealings with the
Soviet Union, saying that just because current Soviet leaders seem
more reform-minded is no reason for the United States to let down
its guard.

   A former fund-raiser for Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. testified today that he was instructed to tell people
lending money to LaRouche organizations that they couldn't be repaid
right away because LaRouche was fighting for the human race and ``in
war there are casualties.''
   Christian Curtis, of Alexandria, Va., told LaRouche's conspiracy
trial that the instruction came from LaRouche fund-raising chief
William Wertz, one of six LaRouche associates on trial with the
political maverick in U.S. District Court here.
   The defendants are accused of devising a scheme to avoid
repayment of loans made to LaRouche organizations. LaRouche alone is
accused of defrauding the Internal Revenue Service by failing to
declare personal services, paid for by his organizations, as income.
   Curtis said he spoke to Wertz about the failure to repay loans
after a retired school teacher complained to him that she lived off
her savings and needed her money back.
   Curtis said Wertz told him he didn't want to hear complaints
about loan repayments.
   ``We're in the midst of a war fighting for the human race. We're
at war. In war there are casualties. You have to tell your contacts
that.''
   ``Did you tell them this?'' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Markham.
   ``No sir,'' Curtis replied. ``We didn't tell them there would be
casualties.''
   Curtis was the third former employee of the three-time
presidential candidate to paint an unflattering picture of LaRouche.
   Curtis, who sought contributions in telephone solicitations, told
jurors that he and other LaRouche staffers were instructed to find
ways to get the money _ and to accept no stories of financial
hardship.
   ``The minute you listen to their excuses, you're dead,'' Curtis
said he was told by superiors in the LaRouche organization.
   LaRouche and his co-defendants are charged with conspiracy to
commit mail fraud and mail fraud, in an alleged scheme to avoid
paying back more than $30 million in loans to LaRouche
organizations. The mail fraud counts result from promissory notes
sent to lenders through the mail.
   LaRouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service, by failing to declare as income the personal and
household services he received from his organizations. LaRouche has
not filed an income tax return since 1979, according to the
indictment.
   The defendants contend that they had planned to pay back the
loans, but had to use the money to defend themselves against
harassment from the federal government and the news media.
   LaRouche also says he's innocent of the tax count because he has
not earned any taxable income since 1979.
   During the first three days of testimony last week, prosecutors
called witnesses who said they were defrauded by LaRouche staffers
who did not keep promises to repay their loans. Then the prosecution
called former LaRouche employees, including a former security aide
who described his onetime boss as paranoid and as a man who lied to
his staff.
   However one prosecution witness, Franklin Harrison Bell, still
works for LaRouche. He testified there was an attempt to pay back
those who lent money to LaRouche's political campaigns, but funds
were scarce.
   Prosecutors introduced into evidence an internal memo by Bell,
which made derogatory remarks about the contributors.
   Conviction for LaRouche could bring a maximum prison term of 65
years and fines of $3.25 million.
   His six co-defendants would face lesser sentences if convicted.
   On trial with LaRouche are his fund-raising chief, William Wertz;
legal adviser Edward Spannaus; and fund-raisers Michael Billington,
Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge To Congressional Pay-Hike System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to disturb
the current system for giving pay raises to members of Congress _ a
system that produced a $12,000 salary hike last year.
   The justices rejected arguments that the process gives too much
power to the president to determine salary levels. The court, also
without comment, declined to use the case to determine what power
members of Congress have to challenge the constitutionality of
federal laws.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and five Republican House members
challenged the pay-raise system after congressional salaries were
raised $12,000 last year to $89,500.
   The pay-raise system, which was established by a 1967 law, also
controls salary increases for federal judges and high-ranking
executive branch officials. But the challengers to the law did not
attack those provisions.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington upheld the
pay-raise system last May 31, ruling it is constitutional because it
allows Congress to override salary increases granted by the
president. The Supreme Court left that ruling intact Monday.
   In other action, the court:
   _Heard arguments about the rights of unwed fathers whose children
are put up for adoption by their mothers.
   _Refused for now to let a Jewish organization display a menorah,
symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a Pittsburgh
government building next month. The court is reviewing the
constitutionality of the display.
   _Agreed to use a case involving a small Pennsylvania and Ohio
railroad to resolve an important railroad industry dispute affecting
the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their
work forces.
   _For the second time this month refused to grant husbands legal
power to prevent their wives from having an abortion. The court
rejected an appeal by a Michigan man who sought unsuccessfully last
summer to stop his then-estranged wife from ending her pregnancy.
   _Allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in New
York to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four
carpenters union locals.
   Prior to 1967, Congress had set its own salary scale. But the
lawmakers, seeking to share responsibility for giving themselves pay
raises, passed the Federal Salary Act in 1967.
   The act calls for a study commission to be convened every four
years with members appointed by all three branches of government.
The commission sumbits recommendations to the president, who in turn
proposes a pay plan to Congress.
   The president's recommendations become effective unless Congress
acts within 30 days to disapprove them.
   The law was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses to
override the president's recommendations. The original law permitted
either house to veto a pay hike. But the so-called legislative veto
was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1983.
   In its ruling in May, the appeals court said the elimination of
the legislative veto causes ``marginally increased practical
difficulty'' for Congress to override a presidential recommendation.
   But, the appeals court said, Congress still is ``afforded the
opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all of the
president's recommendations before they go into effect.''
   The appeals court also rejected the challenge to the pay-hike
statute on grounds the federal courts should not rule in disputes in
which Congress has the power to remedy the problem itself.
   The appeals court also rejected an argument that delegating a
role to the president in setting congressional salaries violates the
constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of
government.
   Challenging the law along with Humphrey were Reps. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Beau Boulter, R-Texas; Jack Davis,
R-Ill.; and Clyde Holloway, R-La.
   They were joined by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and the
National Taxpayers Union.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to uphold the
pay-raise system.

<HEAD>US Willing To Shift UN Debate On Palestinians To Geneva</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, while reaffirming
its judgment that Yasser Arafat is an ``accessory'' to acts of
terrorism, today said it would not oppose the United Nations
shifting its debate on the Palestinian issue to Geneva.
   Even so, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said, the
shift was unnecessary since there were other spokesmen for the
Palestine Liberation Organization in New York who could speak on the
subject apart from chairman Arafat.
   ``We do not oppose the General Assembly considering the
Palestinian question,'' Redman said. ``It's an important matter.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that if the
U.N. session is moved to Geneva, ``we would participate.''
   Arafat was denied a visa on Saturday by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz because, the secretary said, Arafat ``knows of, condones
and lends support'' to acts of terrorism.
   On Sunday, President Reagan said he agreed ``very much'' with the
decision.
   Despite criticism from Arafat and a number of Arab leaders,
Redman said today the decision was ``firm and final.'' He said
denial of the visa was based on the PLO's record. The Palestinian
issue and Middle East peace are separate issues, Redman said.
   ``Probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at
the peace process as the United States has,'' Redman told the State
Department's daily news briefing.
   He rejected the argument of Arab and other critics that the
decision was in conflict with U.S. arrangements with the United
Nations. Redman said the United States reserved the right to protect
its national security even while making arrangements in 1947 to have
the U.N. headquarters in New York.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said the United States intended no
affront to the United Nations.
   ``We were making no kind of statement about the United Nations
but about Yasser Arafat and terrorism,'' Reagan's spokesman said.
   Fitzwater took questions on the U.S. policy on the PLO shortly
after Arafat told reporters in Baghdad, Iraq that he thought the
Reagan administration had violated international law by refusing to
grant him permission to visit the U.N. General Assembly and to
address that body early next month.
   The U.S. dcision has been assailed by Arab groups. But all three
Democrats seeking the top party leadership post in the Senate
offered their support. A spokesman for President-elect George Bush
said Bush had not been consulted in advance of the weekend State
Department announcement.
   Fitzwater said today that ``I don't think many Americans are
having much trouble understanding this decision.''
   Boarding Air Force One as he headed back to Washington after a
six-day vacation at his California mountaintop ranch, Reagan
stressed that the decision on whether to admit Arafat was ``in the
province of the secretary of state'' under U.S. law.
   In rejecting Arafat's request Saturday, Shultz said he could not
waive a legal provision that rules ineligible for a visa any person
considered by the United States to be a threat to its security.
   ``No participant in a peace process can wave the flag of justice
in one hand and brandish the weapons of terrorism in the other,''
the State Department said in a weekend statement.
   Arafat last addressed the United Nations in 1974.
   Asked Sunday whether the United States was sending sufficient
constructive messages about the Middle East peace process, given the
PLO's recent moderate statements, Reagan replied, ``I think the
other would have sent a wrong signal _ that we're patsies.''
   ``We are available and we have been ready to negotiate, when the
conditions are right, at any and all times,'' he said. ``We're the
ones with the peace plan.''
   Reagan did not cite any specific acts of terrorism attributed to
Arafat's PLO in recent weeks or months, although he did say that ``I
think the record shows the things the law is supposed to be
protecting against are still going on in spite of the recent
statements'' by the PLO along more moderate lines.
   Asked what he meant by that, the president said, ``Well, the
approval and use of terrorism and that sort of thing.''
   Meeting in Algiers recently, the Palestine National Council, the
parliamentary arm of Arafat's organization, endorsed resolutions
implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist and renouncing
terrorism. The administration said it found the statements
promising, but too vague.
   When asked point-blank whether he believed the PLO still was
behind terrorism, Reagan said: ``I think there is enough to justify
not granting a waiver.''
   The State Department said the U.S. government had ``convincing
evidence'' that the PLO continues to engage in terrorism, and cited
the presence at the Algiers meeting of an executive committee member
convicted in connection with the hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the
murder of U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer in 1985.
   Sens. J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Daniel K. Inouye of
Hawaii and George Mitchell of Maine _ all guests on Sunday's ``Meet
The Press'' program on NBC-TV _ said they agreed that Arafat should
be denied permission to enter the United States.
   ``The United States should indicate to one and all that we stand
against terrorism, and I think this was a very dramatic way of doing
it,'' said Inouye, who will be vying with Johnston and Mitchell for
the post of Senate majority leader in an election later this week.
   Said Johnston: ``The PLO has members ... who are engaged actively
in terrorism, and as long as that organization does, I don't think
they should be allowed to speak at the U.N.''

   Extra rain and snow are expected in
drought-plagued areas of the Midwest, Appalachia and the Northwest
this winter, the National Weather Service said today.
   The winter forecast, covering December through February, said the
extra precipitation could help those areas in recovering from the
drought of last spring and summer.
   Continued dryness is likely, however, along the southern edge of
the country, the agency reported.
   The forecast calls for a mild winter in the Southeast and
Southwest, while saying that parts of the Northern Plains and upper
Midwest can expect unusually cold conditions. Below-normal
temperatures are considered likely in upper Michigan, Wisconsin,
Minnesota and neighboring parts of Iowa and the Dakotas.
   Areas where warmer-than-normal winter weather is likely range
from the Ohio River and central Pennsylvania southward to Florida
and the Gulf Coast and west through Arkansas, Louisiana, southern
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.
   The best chance for a wet winter was in Michigan, Indiana and the
upper Ohio Valley as well as in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and the
northern Rocky Mountains. A wet winter also was likely from
Wisconsin and Illinois to upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and the Appalachian mountain regions of Virginia, North Carolina and
Tennessee.
   Below-normal precipitation is expected from Southern California
eastward through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana to the
Georgia coast and Florida.

   The U.N. General Assembly will move swiftly
to provide a forum for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who has been
denied a U.S. visa to address the body, the assembly's president
said today.
   Arafat, in his first public comments since the U.S. denial
Saturday, called the U.S. move ``a sheer violation of the
international law and the U.N. charter'' and claimed Washington was
ignoring international backing for the newly proclaimed state of
Palestine.
   ``Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and
explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' asked Arafat. He spoke to
reporters in Iraq.
   Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina, president of the
General Assembly, said today in a written statement that the United
States ``is under the obligation to grant the visa'' sought by
Arafat.
   ``As soon as we receive a special request from the Arab group we
shall proceed in the best possible manner to ensure that Chairman
Arafat is able to address the General Assembly,'' he said.
   The 159-member General Assembly was expected today or Tuesday to
overwhelmingly support a request from the Arab nations to convene a
special assembly in Geneva to hear Arafat. The Arab nations were to
meet today to formulate their request.
   The special session, which would be unprecedented for the United
Nations, would be held either later this month or in January.
   Also today, the U.N. Committee on Relations with the Host Country
was to meet to consider the U.S. decision, which U.N. officials call
a violation of the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement.
   Under the agreement, the United States agrees not to impede with
the transit or work of U.N. diplomats or guests on U.N. business.
   The State Department denied a visa to the Arafat on Saturday,
saying the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman ``knows of,
condones and lends support to'' terrorist attacks.
   President Reagan lauded the decision, saying: ``I think the other
way would have sent out the wrong signal _ that we are patsies.''
   Reaction from other nations was largely negative.
   Speaking today on CBS ``This Morning,'' a member of the PLO
delegation at the United Nations called the U.S. charges of
terrorism ``nonsense.''
   ``It is not serious ... because he (Secretary of State George
Shultz) cannot substantiate his allegations,'' said the PLO
official, Hassan Rahman.
   A U.N. statement said that denying Arafat a forum ``would be
unfortunate at a time when, in the view of the secretary-general,
the recent meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers
provides fresh opportunities for progress towards peace in the
Middle East.''
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed an independent Palestinian state during its meeting in
Algiers on Nov. 15. More than 30 countries, most of them Arab, have
formally recognized the state.
   The Palestine homeland proclamation implicitly recognized Israel
by endorsing a U.N. resolution that guarantees all Middle East
states the right to exist in peace. It promised to restrict
guerrilla activity.
   The Arab League's U.N. ambassador, Clovis Maksoud, said Sunday he
has enough votes to reconvene the General Assembly in special
session in Geneva so Arafat can address the group.
   The non-aligned group in the U.N. has 101 of the 159 voting
members in the General Assembly. The PLO has non-voting observer
status.
   Earlier this year, Arab and developing nations considered moving
the current session to Geneva when a U.S. attempt to close the PLO's
U.N. observer mission was working its way through U.S. courts.
   In March, the General Assembly voted 148-2 to condemn the U.S.
attempt to evict the PLO Mission by attempting to enforce an
anti-terrorism law. Only Israel joined the United States in voting
against the resolution.
   King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have
agreed to spearhead the effort to reconvene the General Assembly
elsewhere, the official Jordan News Agency said Sunday.
   Soviet bloc nations also are likely to side with the PLO.
   Israeli leaders praised the decision, but Algeria, China, Egypt,
France, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Australia were among other nations that protested it.
Italy summoned a U.S. Embassy official to explain the decision.
   China's official Xinhua news agency today called the U.S. move
``another unwise decision.'' Australia said it regretted the move.

   Jim Newlin says some men are shocked when
they learn he is the president of the Kentucky National Organization
for Women, but women tend to take it in stride because they ``don't
keep score the way men do.''
   ``Most men that I know either don't know how to handle it or, I
would say, some are envious and confused ... Some will just say:
`Oh, he's president, congratulations,' based strictly on the fact
that it's an office. They still don't know what the heck it is.''
   Newlin, 56, was elected president in October. He is the second
man to serve as president of a state chapter of NOW, joining lawyer
John Katz, who heads what is called the 51st state chapter in
Washington, D.C.
   Newlin, an administrative assistant for a large Louisville firm,
joined NOW in 1985.
   ``NOW has everything,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It's
peace and economic justice. It's civil rights for everybody _ women,
children, gays, lesbians ... All of the things I really just
automatically believed in because that's the way I grew up. It's not
like I'm a big hero or something. It's just the way I am.''
   Newlin, who is married and has two grown children, grew up during
the Depression.
   ``We weren't rich by any means,'' he said, but when people came
to his home, his mother would feed them.
   ``It wasn't just at Christmas. I remember mother taking our
clothes and giving them to poor people ... I mean, it wasn't a big
deal. You just did it. There was never any hero about it. ... It was
just the people next door didn't have as much as you had and so you
helped them out.''
   Newlin got his start in the women's movement in the early 80s
when, fearing ``the world (was) just going to whiz right by me,'' he
decided to join an organization. He jumped at the opportunity to
work with a Presbyterian Church women's concerns group simply
because it was the first organization he encountered.
   Newlin considers himself a feminist, but said he won't speak for
women.
   ``I will speak on behalf of women the same as I would any other
group who is struggling,'' he said.
   He said he was concerned that winning the presidency would make
it appear he was trying to bully his way into a leadership position.
   ``I'm not a flash in the pan and I'm not ... in here for self
gain.''
   Newlin's NOW colleagues agree.
   ``He goes out of his way not to even participate in a lot of
discussions at our board meetings and things,'' said Stacey Jarbeau,
president of the Jefferson County chapter, the largest in Kentucky
with over 330 members.
   ``He's tried very hard to not let anyone think he's trying to
come in and take over.''
   Patricia Ireland, NOW's executive vice president, said Newlin's
presidency ``is perhaps a reflection of the maturing of the
organization and of our movement that some women and the men who are
members can look at this man and say he has a valuable skill and
he's a strong feminist ... and we want to learn from him and want
him to be our leader and we are not threatened by that.''

<HEAD>12 Injured in Protests to Demand Ouster of President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters rioted Monday during a strike
to demand the ouster of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and 12
people were injured in clashes with security forces, police and
witnesses said.
   Police said 94 people were arrested and charged with rioting
during the six-hour strike, which ended at noon.
   Most stores failed to open, and cars stayed off the streets. In
other parts of the country, ferry, train and air traffic was
disrupted.
   Helmeted police officers fired tear gas at bomb-throwing
demonstrators outside Dhaka University, said the witnesses, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Among those injured were two police officers, one of whom was hit
by fragments from homemade bombs, police said.
   Witnesses said security forces with batons charged a procession
by members of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   They said the mainly young protestors also damaged eight vehicles
and burned a bus.
   The strike halted most public transportation in Dhaka. A few
state-run buses and some privately owned bicycle-powered rickshaws
plied the streets.
   The city of 6 million people was generally calm later Monday
except around Dhaka University, where police confronted roving bands
of youths who threw stones, bricks and small bombs.
   Paramilitary troops patrolled the streets in trucks.
   A senior official at the Bangladesh Secretariat, the government's
administrative center, said employee turnout at government offices
and banks was thin in the early morning but increased later.
   The strike was sponsored by two opposition groups _
Jamiaat-e-Islamic, a Moslem fundamentalist party, and a seven-party
alliance led by Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party.
   The protests were part of the opposition's effort to force Ershad
to resign in favor of a caretaker government that would oversee free
elections.
   The third main opposition group, an eight-party alliance headed
by Sheik Hasina of the Awami League, did not join the strike but
planned nationwide rallies as part of a ``resistance day against the
autocratic regime.''
   Zia and Hasina put aside their personal differences a year ago to
cooperate in an campaign against Ershad, but a series of often
violent strikes failed to remove the former army general. The women
blamed each other for the failure and have pursued separate protests.
   Ershad, 59, seized power in a March 1982 coup and imposed
military law, which was lifted in November 1986 in favor of a
civilian government.
   His Jatiya Party won a parliamentary majority in disputed March 3
elections that were boycotted by the 20 major opposition parties _
including those led by Zia and Hasina _ that have no vote in
Parliament.
   Parliament has passed a law making Islam the official religion of
this 85 percent Moslem nation, drawing strong protests from
opposition politicians, women, students and representatives of
Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities.

   An enraged man who broke out of an
ambulance early today fatally shot two police officers with their
guns before fleeing in a squad car, authorities said.
   The man ditched the squad car a few miles away, stole a second
car at gunpoint and was recaptured in nearby Dania, said Broward
Sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.
   ``He threw down his guns and said, `Please don't shoot me,'''
Leljedal said.
   The suspect gave his name as Charles Street of Boynton Beach,
police said.
   The man had earlier been involved in a domestic disturbance and
was picked up by a police ambulance to be transported for
psychiatric evaluation at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, said
Metro-Dade investigator Arthur Locke.
   ``He broke away and began running through the street yelling and
screaming,'' said Locke. At the time the man had not been charged
with any crime, Locke said.
   When two officers drove up to arrest the man, he managed to grab
both their guns and shoot both of them before driving off, said Fred
Taylor, Metro-Dade police director. He earlier had said the man
initially was armed with a pipe.
   The assailant fired seven shots at the officers, Taylor said.
   Both officers were airlifted to Jackson Hospital.
   Richard Boles, 41, died en route from a chest wound, officials
said.
   David Strzalkowski, 34, underwent surgery for head wounds and was
pronounced dead about noon, police said.
   Street was taken to the Broward County sheriff's office in Fort
Lauderdale, and was charged with minor violations. He later was
transferred to the Dade County Justice building in Miami.

<HEAD>Dealer Trial Challenges Casino Right To Fire at Will</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The right of Nevada casinos to hire and fire
casino workers at will _ something enjoyed since the industry was
legalized more than 50 years ago _ is on trial in a suit brought by
37 dealers and floormen axed by the Las Vegas Hilton.
   The casino workers, swept out five years ago in a housecleaning
sparked by a sharp drop in the casino's blackjack win percentage,
contend they were replaced by younger, mostly female, workers and
are the victims of age and sex discrimination.
   The Hilton claims the firings are just part of life in the casino
business, a cash-fed industry where a bad day's win may get a dealer
fired and where greed and suspicion often dictate personnel
decisions.
   Historically, the resort contends, casino workers have accepted
the implied tradeoff between job security in exchange for the cash
tips they take home every day.
   ``In return for the high compensation, there is little job
security,'' argued Hilton attorney Raymond Kelly. ``Changes of
personnel are frequent in this industry.''
   Casino workers such as dealers and floormen are non-union. Other
hotel workers, such as kitchen help, waiters and others in the
service industry, are generally members of the powerful Culinary
Union.
   The fired workers _ who the Hilton says averaged $100 a day in
tips in addition to $45 a day salary _ are asking a federal court
for reinstatement, back pay and damages that could run into the
millions of dollars.
   The case is being watched as a possible precedent in a state
where the idea of wrongful termination is an evolving area of law
with only a few recent Supreme Court decisions to go by.
   ``We will show that they were fired based only on the date of
hire,'' said Brian Berman, an attorney for the plaintiffs. ``They
didn't even try to make any individual determination at all.''
   ``Out of the 37 fired workers, all but five were over the age of
40,'' said Berman. ``They were replaced by 24 females and only one
of the replacements was over the age of 40. If they had been firing
just at random, there was a one-in-four-million chance they would
fire that many old people.''
   Kelly, however, said the average age of the fired workers was 40,
while the replacements averaged 37.4 years of age.
   The dealers and floormen working the day and swing shift
blackjack pit were fired without notice when they arrived at work
Sept. 2, 1983.
   ``Almost all of them had good evaluations and some of them were
legends in the industry,'' said Berman. ``They were the best of them
all.''
   The firings, both sides acknowledge, came after a period in which
the casino's ``drop,'' or percentage of money it wins, fell to 1
percent at the blackjack tables.
   The Las Vegas average house percentage win in blackjack games is
generally between 18 and 20 percent.
   ``Something drastic was occuring here,'' Kelly said. ``We're
talking about thousands of dollars a day and millions of dollars
over the long term.''
   The resort finally decided to clean house.
   ``Following the termination of the plaintiffs in this case, the
`P.C.' (casino term for percentage) returned to normal,'' Kelly said
in opening arguments.
   Kelly acknowledged that the hotel never pinpointed any dealer
cheating.
   The dealers contend middle management was stealing money,
although they also cannot prove their charges.
   ``Losses of the magnitude they were having could not be explained
by a dealer scam,'' said Berman. ``We're talking about wheelbarrows
full of chips they would have had to be hauling out of there.''
   The trial, which began last week, is expected to continue for at
least three months before U.S. District Judge Roger Foley.

<HEAD>Negotiations on U.S. Bases to Resume in December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman said Monday the next
round of talks on U.S. bases in Greece will take place in Athens in
mid-December.
   Negotiators are trying to forge an agreement that would extend
U.S. control of four bases in Greece beyond the Dec. 31 expiration
date.
   ``The base negotiations are very difficult and no one can exclude
the possibility that they might be suspended at some stage,'' said
government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   The last round of negotiations ended earlier this month in
Washington.
   Talks broke off in September when Greece announced the Hellenikon
base near Athens would have to close after the current pact expires
Dec. 31.
   About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700
Greeks work at the base, which was set up in the 1940s.
   Negotiations resumed Oct. 3, after Secretary of State George
Shultz met Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias, who was on a visit to
Washington.
   Since the 1950s, the United States has operated four military
bases in Greece, two near Athens and two on the southern island of
Crete. In addition to Hellenikon, there is a navy communications
base at Nea Makri near Athens, a navy installation at Souda Bay on
the island of Crete, and an Air Force communications base at
Gournes, also on Crete.
   As compensation, the United States pays Greece more than $430
million a year in military credits.

<HEAD>Missing University Chandelier Reappears At City Library</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brown University has asked police to find
out how a turn-of-the-century chandelier that disappeared from the
school sometime in the late 1970s has reappeared in the newly
renovated Providence Public Library.
   The 175-pound chandelier, whose value is estimated at $15,000 to
$20,000, is the centerpiece of the library's periodicals atrium,
which was opened to the public with much fanfare two weeks ago.
   After the ceremony, Brown officials realized the chandelier was
identical to one that had hung in Alumnae Hall from 1927 until it
was taken down during restoration work about 10 years ago, said
university spokesman Robert Reichley.
   ``Someone took a photo from our archives and compared it,''
Reichley said. ``There doesn't seem to be any doubt whether it's one
and the same.''
   Joseph Enright, a Providence dealer in light fixtures, told The
Providence Journal in a story published Monday that he bought the
fixture in 1985 from a Brown maintenance man who said he would take
the chandelier to the junkyard if Enright did not want it.
   Enright later sold the chandelier to Arthur Groger, a Newport
antiques dealer, who rented it to Trinity Repertory Theater in
Providence for a production of ``All the King's Men.'' The library
purchased the chandelier from Groger last year after a staffer saw
it at the theater, the newspaper said.
   John Kuprevich, Brown's director of police and security, said his
department has asked city police to help investigate. ``It is our
belief that it was not authorized to be disposed of in any way,
shape or form,'' he said.
   Reichley and Howard E. Walker, chairman of the library's board of
directors, said it was too early to tell whether Brown would attempt
to recover the chandelier.
   ``We're working cooperatively and amicably in trying to solve
this issue,'' Reichley said.
   ``I think it looks splendid. We certainly think it's an ideal
fixture for our location,'' Walker said.

<HEAD>Presidential Elections Set for Dec. 12, No Immediate Candidates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Presidential elections will take place
in two weeks, officials announced Monday, but there were no
immediate contenders for the mostly ceremonial post.
   The job is open to any Moslem aged 45 years or more. None of the
parties that contested this month's general elections has put
forward a candidate.
   The current president is Ghulam Ishaq Khan, 73, formerly chairman
of the senate who took over Aug. 17 after Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq
died in a plane crash.
   The president will be chosen by an electoral college of members
of the senate, national assembly, and four provincial legislatures
of Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan, and North West Frontier province. Each
will meet separately and simultaneously to elect the president Dec.
12.
   No party or group has enough of the 807 electoral votes to choose
a president, should more than one candidate emerge.
   Ishaq Khan, a senior civil servant and internationally known
economist and diplomat, has indicated he may not seek election.
   ``I am tired and will like to have rest instead of being
president,'' he said recently.
   But analysts say he could be persuaded to continue in the post if
several political parties ask him.
   Benazir Bhutto, whose popular Pakistan People's Party won a
majority of 93 national assembly and 184 provincial legislative
seats, said her party wants a president supported by others.
   ``We want a consensus candidate, a person who knows all the
policies and how the administration works,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto's biggest rival is a nine-party grouping called the
Islamic Democratic Alliance which won 55 national and 145 provincial
seats.
   Both parties are trying to win over independents who garnered a
large number of seats in national and provincial assemblies. The
party commanding the biggest majority probably will be asked to form
a government by Ishaq Khan in an announcement scheduled Dec. 1.
   Ishaq Khan is expected to ask Ms. Bhutto to be prime minister,
the holder of real political power in Pakistan, though the president
can fire the prime minister.
   Presidential candidates must be nominated before Dec. 6.

<HEAD>State Department Says Blind Need Not Apply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avraham Rabby had high hopes that his
impressive academic and linguistic credentials would qualify him for
a career in diplomacy.
   But the State Department, after showing interest in Rabby for
three years, finally ruled against him.
   Diplomacy, the State Department believes, is not a suitable
profession for the blind.
   ``I am absolutely outraged,'' Rabby said in a recent interview.
``It is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government
has shown itself to be able to employ blind people constructively.
The State Department is still in the 19th century.''
   The State Department had been accepting job applications from
blind people for 10 years and Rabby himself had passed five entrance
examinations since 1985. He recently was scheduled to take another.
   But the department ruled that the blind would not be permitted to
take examinations in Braille or use other outside help, thus making
it impossible for Rabby or others with similar disabilities to meet
the entrance requirements.
   Rabby, who lives in New York City, is a graduate of Oxford
University in England with degrees in Spanish and French and has a
master's degree in business administration from the University of
Chicago.
   He was born in what is now Israel 46 years ago and lived for 15
years in England and six months each in France and Spain. He speaks
with the elegantly phrased formulations of a man accustomed to
intellectual pursuits. He has his own consulting business, helping
disabled people find employment.
   State Department officials, speaking only on condition they not
be named, said the policy of rejecting blind applicants after
allowing them to take admission tests was not as cynical as it might
seem.
   They said blind applicants were routinely advised that permission
for them to take admission tests did not mean that medical standards
requiring ``visual acuity'' for all diplomats would be relaxed.
   The State Department view under the recent ruling is that all
foreign service officers must be ``worldwide available'' and that a
blind person cannot be expected to deal with the myriad demands
diplomats face.
   One official said the United States has facilities for helping
the blind overcome their handicap but that most foreign countries
lack such accommodations.
   Another said that much of diplomacy involves reading the ``body
language'' of foreign envoys during diplomatic discussions. Such
gestures as winks and nods form part of the overall message a
diplomat must assimilate, the official said.
   Rabby said the blind are quite capable of picking up ``non-verbal
signals.'' Nervousness, he said, ``can be read by projection of
voice'' as can a smile.
   He said the blind are no less able than sighted people to read
other people's language, be it ``silent or verbal.''
   But a department official said accepting a blind person for
diplomatic service ``would be a terribly unfair thing to do to that
individual.'' He cited high-risk posts, such as Lebanon, as
particularly inappropriate for a sightless person.
   Perry Shankle, president of the American Foreign Service
Association, the union of career diplomats, agreed.
   ``It's dangerous out there,'' Shankle said, emphasizing he was
speaking for himself and not the association. ``It's one of the
facts of life for the diplomatic service. You have to be constantly
on the alert.''
   He suggested that the State Department could resolve the problem
by admitting the blind not as career diplomats but as civil
servants, who generally do not receive overseas assignments.
   Kenneth Jernigan, executive director of the National Federation
of the Blind, has little patience with the arguments of State
Department officials.
   ``Everybody says it's wonderful what blind people can do so long
as they work somewhere else,'' Jernigan said from his office in
Baltimore.
   He said dealing with reading material is the principal activity
of diplomats and blind people are capable of handling ``mountains of
paperwork.'' Beyond that, he said, the blind require no more
secretarial help than sighted persons.
   Jernigan added that the federation was prepared to take the State
Department to court but he hoped that recourse could be avoided.
   James Gashel, director of government affairs for the federation,
said federal law requires that all government and
government-assisted programs conduct their employment practices
without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The blind and other
disabled persons, he said, must be provided with ``reasonable
accommodation'' to help them overcome their handicap.
   But, he said, the State Department wants a general exemption from
this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats
must work.
   He said the last time a blind person threatened court action
against the State Department on the basis of discrimination, the
agency decided on an out of court settlement worth $165,000 to the
complainant.
   His account could not be confirmed by State Department officials.

<HEAD>Investigator Hopes to Probe Church Vault for Wedding Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Records of William Shakespeare's ``shotgun
wedding'' may be hidden beneath a disused church near
Stratford-upon-Avon, says an investigator who probed beneath the
floor with radar and optical-fiber photography.
   ``If you can find where he was married, you might stumble across
something else,'' Arthur Marlow said Monday.
   Marlow, 69, is seeking permission from the Redundant Churches
Fund to open the vault beneath All Saints Church at Billesley, four
miles west of Stratford. Pictures taken through a fiber-optic probe
inserted into the vault show several coffins and what appear to be
two chests in the vault.
   ``If they decide in my favor, we can start work in the new
year,'' he said by telephone from his home in Market Harborough,
about 50 miles north of the Bard's town.
   Excavation won't prove or disprove the authorship of the plays, a
question which Marlow considers settled in favor of William
Shakespeare of Stratford.
   ``What I want to know, what thousands of people want to know,
they want to know about his background, his life. What did he do?
Where did he live?''
   Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway in 1582, when the playwright
was 18. Their first child, Susanna, was baptized May 26, 1583. A
bond dated Nov. 28, 1582, taken as security for the bishop to issue
a marriage license, is the principal surviving document of the
marriage.
   ``She was three months pregnant, Anne Hathaway was at the time
they married. It was what you would call a shotgun wedding,'' Marlow
said.
   Where the couple exchanged vows is a mystery, and two other
churches west of Stratford are candidates. Temple Grafton is listed
beside the name of ``Annam Whateley,'' intended bride of William
Shakespeare, in the bishop's register. Marlow believes this is a
different William Shakespeare; some scholars think the bride's name
is just badly misspelled.
   A 19th century tradition places the marriage at Luddington, which
like Temple Grafton has no records surviving from Shakespeare's time.
   Anne's pregnancy, Marlow said, may account for the couple's
choice of a rural church instead of the notoriety of a wedding in
Stratford.
   The Hathaway family lived at Shottery, a hamlet just west of
Stratford that had no church. Billesley is one of three churches
within a few miles to the west.
   Billesley, Marlow noted, is just a half-mile from Wilmcote, the
home of Shakespeare's mother.
   Susanna's daughter, Elizabeth, Shakespeare's only grandchild,
took her second husband in the church in Billesley. Marlow suggests
that her first marriage may have been there as well _ following what
he believes is a family tradition started by the playwright.
   It's thought that Shakespeare may have used the library at
Billesley Hall, now a tourist inn. The owners have pledged about
$180 toward the cost of digging into the vault, Marlow said.
   Marlow, a retired metallurgist, is an old hand at opening tombs.
In 1969, he said, he located the grave of Mary Fitton, one of the
women who may have been the mysterious ``dark lady'' of
Shakespeare's sonnets.

   Air traffic over the Kansas City area was
rerouted for about an hour Monday after fire damaged the main
computer at the Federal Aviation Administration's Traffic Control
Center in Olathe.
   About 20 flights scheduled to fly over Olathe's airspace were
rerouted after fire and sparks developed in the computer about 4
a.m., said Sandra Campbell, the center's public affairs officer. The
rerouting caused delays at airports in St. Louis, Chicago and Denver.
   A backup computer was installed about an hour after the fire, but
FAA officials said slowdowns were expected to continue through the
day.
   The Olathe center monitors all flights in a 200-mile radius,
except those being handled by nearby Kansas City International
Airport. No flights to or from Kansas City were affected because
they are controlled by a separate operation, said David Napoli, the
airport operations manager.

<HEAD>U.S. Foreign Trade Imbalance Improves for Third Consecutive Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drop in oil prices and higher costs for U.S.
farm products helped provide a 5.4 percent improvement in America's
trade deficit from July through September, the third consecutive
quarterly decline this year, the government reported Monday.
   The Commerce Department said the imbalance between what America
imports and what it sells abroad narrowed to $28.53 billion in the
third quarter, the best showing in 3{ years.
   The deficit had fallen by 14.6 percent in the first quarter and
declined another 14.3 percent in the second quarter to a revised
$30.15 billion. Through the first nine months of the year, the
deficit is running at an annual rate of $125.2 billion, compared
with last year's record $160.3 billion deficit.
   Analysts predicted the deficit for all of 1988 should be at least
20 percent lower than 1987, marking the first time since President
Reagan took office in 1981 that the trade deficit has shown
improvement.
   That gain has contributed significantly to the economy's
momentum, providing almost half of total growth this year. But many
analysts believe the rapid trade improvement will slow in 1989 and
as a result they are looking for a much more sluggish economy next
year.
   ``The trade deficit has definitely turned around, but we ost of his
career in government, was tapped by
President-elect George Bush Monday to be his press secretary.
   Bush said he chose Fitzwater, who was his vice presidential press
secretary from 1985 to 1987, because ``I think he's the best.''
   The spokesman has received high marks from many reporters
covering the White House. But there also have been complaints that
he is too easygoing and too often skips his daily White House
briefings for reporters.
   Fitzwater was philosophical about the criticism.
   ``Facing the White House press corps every day is no day at the
beach,'' he said.
   As to how long he would remain, he said, ``I figure you do this
job the way you run the quarter mile. You run as long and hard as
you can and as fast as you can, and when you drop they bring in
someone else.''
   He said the offer from Bush, which came in a telephone call to
his office at 8:30 in the morning, came as a surprise.
   ``I was making plans to leave,'' he said. He said he planned to
call his two children and tell them the news as soon as they got out
of school.
   Fitzwater's selection marks the first time any incoming president
has chosen as his permament press secretary the same individual who
did the job for his predecessor. President Kennedy's press
secretary, Pierre Salinger, stayed on briefly after Kennedy's
assassination 25 years ago, but President Lyndon B. Johnson soon
replaced him with Bill Moyers.
   Fitzwater grew up on a farm in Abilene, Kan.
   As a high school student, he planted tulips at the Eisenhower
Library in Abilene. ``There was a huge picture of Ike and Jim
Hagerty (Eisenhower's press secretary),'' he said in an interview
last year. ``Even then I wondered what it would be like'' to have
that job.
   He landed it in February, 1987, after Larry Speakes resigned.
Speakes had taken over the duties from James Brady, who was
seriously wounded in an attempt on the president's life in March,
1981.
   The job pays $77,400 a year.
   Bush said he had asked Fitzwater to remain as press secretary,
the title that normally goes with the position of presidential
spokesman. In the Reagan administration that title had been reserved
for Brady.
   Asked if Brady would have a role in the new administration,
Fitzwater said Bush had ``raised the question internally'' and that
the vice president and his advisers ``have some ideas of things they
would like him to do.''
   From 1981 until 1983, Fitzwater was press spokesman at the
Treasury Department.
   Earlier, he served nine years as a spokesman at the Environmental
Protection Agency after working as a speechwriter for
then-Transportation Secretary John Volpe and at the Appalachian
Regional Commission.
   He was a deputy White House press secretary from 1983 to 1985,
when he joined the vice president's staff.
   He was a correspondent and editor with a number of Kansas
newspapers before coming to Washington.
   Fitzwater made no commitments as to how often Bush would meet
with reporters, but said, ``I knew him before to be an open person
willing to deal with the press and I think he will be again.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday dismissed as
``absurd'' a former state senator's request for a reduction in his
seven-year sentence, saying ex-fugitive David Friedland has been
toying with the legal system for too long.
   Friedland, convicted of pension fund fraud, contends he should
have his sentence reducted to probation because he cooperated with
the government, putting his life in danger.
   His attorney, Brian Shaughnessy, also argued that the sentence
would have been reduced three years ago, when a reduction first was
requested, if Friedland had not been indicted a second time for
fraud. He said an assistant U.S. attorney sabotaged chances of a
reduction by telling the court of the second case.
   Friedland faces sentencing Friday for his guilty plea on that
charge. Both cases involve his bilking of the same Teamsters fund,
New Brunswick-based Local 701, at different times.
   Friedland, 51, feigned a drowning accident weeks before the
original sentence reduction hearing in September 1985 and the return
of the second fraud indictment. When Friedland failed to appear in
court, U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise dismissed the
reduction motion but gave him a 30-day grace period.
   Friedland was recaptured last December in the Indian Ocean nation
of the Maldives after a globe-trotting year on the run.
   ``Frankly, I find this an absurd position,'' Debevoise said of
Friedland's request for a sentence reduction.
   Debevoise said the ``absurd and irresponsible conduct of the
feigned death and flight alone'' was enough to deny the motion. He
also cited the fact that while Friedland was cooperating with the
government, starting in 1982, he was engaged in the second fraud.
   ``Mr. Friedland has been toying with the court system, the
justice system, for so many years,'' he said.
   After his 1980 conviction for receiving payoffs to arrange loans
from the pension fund, Friedland signed an agreement to cooperate
with the U.S. attorney's office in 1982. He subsequently provided
information on corruption in Hudson County.
   His efforts helped convict former Weehawkin Mayor Wally Lindsley
and did not go much beyond that.
   ``I think in retropspect it's very hard to say he rendered
complete cooperation,'' First Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael
Chertoff said after the hearing.
   ``This guy was always figuring who he wanted to give up, who he
didn't want to give up,'' said Chertoff.
   On Friday, Friedland is to appear before U.S. District Judge John
Gerry in Camden. He faces a 20-year sentence for his guilty plea,
which he entered in September after four days of trial.
   In that case, Friedland was charged with heading a scheme to
defraud $20 million from the Teamsters pension fund.

   A Cuban human rights activist said Monday that
Cuban authorities have arrested about 30 people who testified before
a United Nations delegation which reviewed the rights situation on
the island two months ago.
   Ricardo Bofill, who heads an independent human rights group in
Cuba, told reporters the arrests violated a government promise not
to punish anyone who provided information to the delegation from the
U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   The six-member delegation will issue a report on its findings
when the full commission reconvenes for its next session in February.
   Bofill, who said he has been to prison many times, acknowledged
that Cuban authorities may take action against him on his return to
the island for speaking about the alleged abuses.
   ``All these things have a price but we have to keep on
fighting,'' he said.
   Efforts to obtain comment by telephone from Cuban diplomatic
officials in Washington were not immediately successful.

   Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands wounded
five rioters Monday during a general strike honoring the 5,000
Palestinians imprisoned in a year of rebellion, hospital officials
reported.
   Dissension increased between rival Palestinian factions in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip over the declaration of an
independent state Nov. 15 by the Palestine National Council, which
acts as a legislature for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Security forces cracked 13 Palestinian guerrilla groups that
operated in the occupied West Bank, a military spokesman said. The
groups were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and
civilians, as well as on Arabs suspected of collaborating with
Israel, he said.
   Troops demolished the homes of 10 of the suspected guerrillas and
sealed the homes of three others, the spokesman said. House
demolition is a routine punishment meted out to suspected guerrillas.
   Palestinians scrawled anti-American slogans and pasted up
pictures of PLO chief Yasser Arafat to protest the refusal by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to grant Arafat a visa to
address the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   Rioters at Nablus in the West Bank set tires ablaze and flew
dozens of outlawed Palestinian flags in the public market, a maze of
alleys and stone-stepped passageways where battles between soldiers
and young Arabs are common.
   Two teen-agers and two men in their 20s suffered bullet wounds,
officials at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital reported. They said one
victim was a 17-year-old shot in the stomach.
   Another 17-year-old was wounded in the right thigh during a
confrontation at the Beach refugee camp in Gaza, officials there
reported.
   At least 316 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000
wounded in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven Israelis
also have been slain.
   In Ramallah, another West Bank city, underground leaders of the
rebellion distributed leaflets urging merchants to ignore a call by
Islamic extremists and a Marxist PLO faction for another strike
Tuesday.
   The purpose of Tuesday's strike is to protest a U.N. plan adopted
Nov. 29, 1947, for the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab
states. The Palestine National Council implicitly recognized Israel
by making that and two other U.N. resolutions part of its
independence declaration.
   Underground leaders backed by the PLO called the strike Monday
while more than 300,000 Palestinians _ 20 percent of those living in
the West Bank and Gaza _ were confined to their homes under army
curfews.
   Military spokesmen announced that soldiers demolished several
Palestinian homes Monday, but said they had no details.
   Residents said soldiers put a curfew on El-Khadr, a village near
Bethlehem in the West Bank, and demolished several houses.
Townspeople in Tulkarem said troops sealed the house of a
50-year-old Arab butcher who was arrested with his son last month
for anti-Israeli activism.
   Hamas (Zeal) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine issued the strike call for Tuesday to protest the nature
of the independence declaration. They oppose any negotiations with
the Israelis and want all of Palestine as an independent state,
including what is now Israel.
   Leaflets distributed by the PFLP over the weekend urged
Palestinians to wage a ``a war of Molotov cocktails, acid, knives
and stones'' against Israel.
   One anti-American slogan painted on a wall in Ramallah said:
``The United States is the enemy of the Palestinian people.''
   Ten American peace and human rights activists visiting the
occupied lands met with U.S. Consul Philip Wilcox and handed him a
statement criticizing the ``represensible action'' by Shultz.
   ``This decision violates the U.N. charter, seriously damages U.S.
credibility in the Middle East and limits opportunities for a
political and peaceful solution to the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict,'' the statement said.
   The group, which includes representatatives of churches and the
YWCA, is on a two-week tour sponsored by the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee.

<HEAD>Ten New Senators: Looking, Lunching and Lobbying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 10 men who will become new senators in
January gathered in the Capitol Monday for a hectic orientation tour
that, for Democrats, included lobbying by the three veterans who
want their votes for majority leader.
   ``It's a special day you'll never forget,'' said Sen.-elect
Herbert Kohl, D-Wis. ``But it's also like going to college as a
freshman.''
   The newly elected senators, five Republicans and five Democrats,
were quickly embroiled in Senate politics as they eyed coveted
committee assignments, prime office locations and other perquisites
of life in the Senate.
   For Trent Lott it wasn't necessarily a step up in life. The
veteran congressman gave up his position as House Republican whip to
run for, and win, the Senate seat vacated by the retiring John
Stennis.
   ``You look at the House and the Senate and there certainly are a
lot of differences,'' Lott said. ``Like why it takes three months in
the Senate to move in 10 guys, when in the House they move in 43
people in 30 days.''
   The five freshmen Democrats hadn't even had time to sit down for
lunch before being lobbied by the three men who want their votes
Tuesday when the majority party elects its leaders.
   Kohl announced he would support Sen. George Mitchell of Maine for
the job because ``he's a person I'm confortable with.'' Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut said he hadn't made up his mind and called
it ``the first major decision I'll have to make as a senator.''
   ``I honestly don't know them very well,'' Lieberman said.
``They're all saying roughly the same thing. It comes down to a
decision in your gut.''
   Mitchell, 55, also picked up the endorsements of Sens. Edward
Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts and Bob Graham of Florida
over the weekend. But Sens. Daniel Inouye, 64, of Hawaii and Bennett
Johnston, 56 of Louisiana also have support and no one is predicting
the outcome.
   ``I haven't the vaguest notion who's going to win,'' said Sen.
Alan Dixon, D-Ill. ``There must be 75 of us if you add up the
promised votes,'' he said, suggesting that some of the 55 Democrats
were playing multiple choice in the verbal straw balloting.
   ``My experience, my seniority should be in my favor,'' Inouye
said in an interview Sunday.
   ``Clearly, my centrist approach is an advantage,'' Johnston said.
``It would be a good message for the country, it would be a good
message for the Democratic party.''
   Most of the freshmen were more interested in lobbying for office
space and committee assignments, and in finding their way through
the labyrinth of hallways, corridors and subways that honeycomb the
Capitol.
   Senator-elect Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican who unseated
veteran Democrat John Melcher, wasn't too concerned with seeking out
plum offices and assignments. Under complicated Senate rules and
procedures, he stands at the bottom of the seniority ladder.
   ``Everybody's worrying about numbers _ whether they'll be number
97, 98 or whatever,'' said Burns. ``I said, `Boys, you can't get any
lower than 100.'''
   Burns hadn't yet acquired the Senate uniform of dark suit, red
tie and cufflinks. The former farm radio broadcaster showed up in
brown pants, a sportcoat and Western belt buckle and said he was
busy ``getting your feet on the ground, learning what you can do and
what you can't do.''
   Kohl said that, despite the rounds of meetings, receptions,
introductions, tours and speeches, ``it's a very personal day, a
red-letter day for me. My father and mother were immigrants. Sixty
five years ago they had nothing, and now their son is a United
States senator.''
   ``That's what I was thinking about as I listened to Byrd and Dole
speak,'' Kohl said, referring to Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd
and Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   ``I feel the sense of history,'' said Lieberman. ``It's not going
to be an easy time to be a United States senator,'' he said, citing
budget deficits, taxes and environmental problems.
   Dixon, an eight-year Senate veteran, was asked if he had any
advice for the freshman Class of 1989.
   ``I'll tell them to pray a lot,'' he said with a grin.

<HEAD>Solidarity Agrees to Terms for TV Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides have agreed to terms for a
nationally televised debate Wednesday night between Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa and the head of the official trade union
alliance, a Solidarity spokesman said.
   The debate between Walesa and Alfred Miodowicz is to take place
immediately after the main evening news show.
   If it comes off as planned, it would be the first time that
Walesa has ever been allowed to appear live on state-controlled
Polish television to present his reasons for wanting the banned
union made legal again.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity's national spokesman, said he
reached agreement Monday on general terms for the meeting during a
telephone conversation with Miodowicz's representative, Jan Bogutyn.
   Bogutyn and the television director, Marek Tumanowicz, were not
immediately available for comment, according to spokesmen at their
offices.
   Earlier in the day, Miodowicz, who is also a member of Poland's
ruling Polish United Workers (Communist) Party Politburo, told a
news conference that he was ready for the debate on trade union
issues.
   Walesa also said he is ready to face Miodowicz.
   ``I've already bought tickets for the morning train'' to Warsaw,
said Walesa, speaking by telephone from his home in Gdansk.
   Onyszkiewicz said the Solidarity side agreed to his federation's
proposals that the debate be broadcast live from Warsaw, that
Miodowicz be allowed to speak first, that there will be no
moderator, and that Miodowicz and Walesa mutually decide how the
tape of the broadcast would be used in the future.
   According to Onyszkiewicz, the official union did not oppose a
Solidarity proposal that film director Andrzej Wajda be allowed to
have a film crew inside the state TV studio and make a backup tape
of the debate, but said it would leave that decision to TV officials.
   ``We would expect TV to agree,'' Onyszkiewicz said. Solidarity
says it needs such a backup as a record, in case state TV somehow
manipulates the broadcast to Walesa's disadvantage.
   Walesa's last appearance on Polish TV was in 1983 when he was
allowed to speak from the floor at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk
after a speech by then-Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   Rakowski, who became Poland's prime minister in September,
answered Walesa and Walesa was cut off when he tried to reply.
   Miodowicz proposed the TV debate with Walesa on Nov. 14 during an
interview with the official communist party daily Trybuna Ludu.
   Miodowicz's federation says it represents 7 million Polish
workers. The official unions were formed by the government in 1982
to replace Solidarity, outlawed following the 1981 martial-law
crackdown.
   Solidarity has remained active despite the ban, and argues that
it should be relegalized alongside the official unions.
   Miodowicz maintains there should be only one union in one
enterprise and says Solidarity supporters should join his unions and
attempt to influence them from within.

   A painting of two circus acrobats by Pablo Picasso
sold for 20.9 million pounds ($38.46 million) at auction Monday
night, becoming the most expensive 20th century work of art.
   The buyer was not immediately identified by Christie's auction
house, and the seller was an unidentified private owner.
   The 1905 painting from Picasso's Rose Period called ``Acrobat and
Young Harlequin'' was sold in 3{ minutes, with the bidding starting
at 5 million pounds ($9.2 million).
   The price topped the previous 20th century painting record, also
for a Picasso, set Nov. 14 when his ``Maternity'' sold in New York
for $24.75 million.
   After being shown in Paris in 1905, ``Acrobat and Young
Harlequin'' found its way into a German museum and was confiscated
by the Nazis in 1937 as an example of decadent art.
   They sold it at auction in Switzerland to a Belgian collector and
it had been in private hands since them.
   Christie's sale rooms were crowded for an auction of 69
Impressionist and modern works of art by 40 artists.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Monday the
United States violated international law by refusing him a visa to
address the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week.
   ``Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and
explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' Arafat said to reporters in
Baghdad, where the Palestine Liberation Organization has its
military headquarters.
   At a meeting Nov. 15 in Algiers, the Palestine National Council
declared an independent Palestinian state and implicitly recognized
Israel. The council acts as the PLO legislature.
   Arafat called the U.S. rejection of his visa application ``a
sheer violation of international law'' and ``a grave violation of
the 1947 headquarters treaty'' between the United States and United
Nations.
   He said the United States chose to ignore international approval
of the new Palestinian policy. Palestinian officials say 67 nations
have declared support for an independent Palestine.
   Only Israel has welcomed a statement by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz denying the visa on grounds that Arafat was ``an
accessory'' to terrorism ``by PLO elements.''
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said: ``Maybe now part of
the world will have to re-examine the situation and take another
look at the record of the PLO. It's quite a bloody record.''
   In his comments to journalists Monday, Arafat said Jordan was
seeking to have the General Assembly debate on the Palestinian
issue, scheduled to begin Thursday, moved to Geneva or Vienna so the
PLO chairman could attend.
   Jordan's official daily Al-Sha'b said in an editorial: ``This
American decision against Palestinians and Arabs and many other
countries in the world aims at suffocating the moderate and positive
Palestinian voice ... the voice of peace that everyone in the Arab
world is calling for.''
   Arab criticism of the visa refusal was echoed by communist
nations and by Western allies of the United States, which urged
Washington to reconsider. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a U.S.
ally who supports moving the debate, also said he had asked Shultz
and President Reagan to change the decision.
   Mubarak said he hoped ``the United States will respond because
that will help to push the peace process in the region.''
   Arafat called the Palestine National Council declarations, which
include renunciation of violence outside Israel and Israeli occupied
territory, ``the last chance for peace'' in the Middle East.
   U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations in the Persian Gulf
region asked Washington to revise a decision ``which does not
harmonize with its principles of peace, justice and harmony inthe
world,'' a Saudi official said in a statement carried by the
kingdom's official news agancy.
   Syria, which has feuded with Arafat for years, accused the United
States of favoritism toward Israel and declared: ``We all know ...
the Americans laud the strong and despise the weak.''
   Saud Osaimi, Kuwaiti minister for state for foreign affairs,
summoned U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell to ``express Kuwait's deep
regret.'' A government statement said Howell was told the decision
``does not conform with the responsibilities of the United States
and its role toward the world community in preserving world peace
and stability.''
   In Bahrain, the Foreign Ministry expressed ``surprise and
astonishment.'' Qatar said Washington should ``revise its
unjustified decision ... to prove its credibility in a serious quest
for a just and lasting settlement.''
   Sheik Hamdan Bin Zayed, foreign undersecretary of the United Arab
Emirates, said reconsidering the decision was ``a necessity to
bolster the efforts exerted for establishing a just and lasting
peace in the Middle East.''
   North Yemen's parliamentary urged Arab and Islamic governments,
along with ``peace-loving countries,'' to make a unified response to
the U.S. action.
   It said denying a visa was ``no response to the positive steps
that the Palestinian leadership took and the sincere desire it
demonstrated for ... a just peace.''

   The government announced Monday the inflation rate
has risen to 26 percent in October, despite an austerity program
that began two months ago.
   The new figure is the highest monthly inflation rate since the
1950s and likely will continue rising through December, the official
State Statistical Bureau said.
   In September, government leaders began an austerity drive
designed to curb inflation below 10 percent.
   However, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted the bureau as
saying panic buying in August and September has ``almost ended'' and
bank savings, which went down sharply, was returning to normal.
   Authorities have imposed rationing after reports of panic buying
of textiles in Shanghai and salt in 19 other areas.
   The inflation statistics came as the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, which has charted economic reforms, and
the State Planning Commission, in charge of economic planning, met
on Monday.
   A television news broadcast said Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier
Yao Yilin, who head the commissions respectively, reported progress
was being made but more work was needed to reign in the overheated
economy.
   The report did not say if the commissions were considering new
measures to reduce inflation.
   State Statistical Bureau spokesman Mao Youfeng told Xinhua that
China's retail price index in October was 26.1 percent higher than
in October 1987. The last time China released comparable figures, it
said June prices were up 19 percent over June 1987.
   Mao said prices in October were up 17 percent from Jan. 1 and the
annual inflation rate is believed to be about 40 percent.
   The official China News Service has said that September retail
prices in the southern commercial city of Canton were up 44 percent
from a year earlier, and inflation in other cities also was above
the national average.
   China has not experienced such high inflation since the initial
years after World War II and the 1949 communist takeover. Although
inflationary pressures existed, the government kept prices
artificially low and subsidized farmers and factories.
   In recent years, the government has raised some prices and
decontrolled others in an effort to develop a market-style economy.
Prices have been pushed up by growing industrial demand for limited
raw materials, fuel and transport services, as well as by high
consumer demand for household appliances.
   In addition, inflation was fueled by widespread hoarding and
profiteering.
   In an effort to curb demand, the government in late September
ordered a halt to thousands of construction projects nationwide and
told government offices to cut spending.
   However, industrial output still grew more than 20 percent in
October over the previous year, indicating the policies have not yet
been effective.

<HEAD>FBI Tried To Buy Employment Lists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI tried to buy names of unemployed
workers in the Portland area last year in hopes of tracking down
fugitives, but Oregon Employment Division officials rejected the
request, a newspaper reported Monday.
   FBI officials said the proposal was a routine technique for
catching criminals, but an employee approached at the division's
office in Portland's Skid Row said she was concerned about violating
the confidentiality of the agency's mostly impoverished clientele,
the Salem Statesman-Journal reported in a copyright story Monday.
   ``I'm all for helping the police and the FBI,'' said Patti
Sherman. ``But on the other hand, this is a homeless shelter where
individuals come and want to feel safe. I would have felt like a spy
if I sold their names. That's the most dishonest thing I personally
could have done.''
   Employment Division director W.E. Hunter disclosed the FBI's
proposal after a division worker in Springfield was fired last month
for notifying law enforcement officials that a client was wanted on
a probation violation charge in Washington state.
   Karen Hulsey, a 12-year veteran of the division, has appealed her
firing. Hunter said she violated the division's privacy policy,
which he re-emphasized after the FBI's proposal was made last year.
   In October 1987, FBI agents tried to obtain lists of unemployed
people visiting the state office in Portland's Skid Row. That action
was part of a national FBI effort to purchase names, Social Security
numbers and birth dates of clients and employees of private
companies and government agencies, said James Dietz, a special agent
in the FBI's Portland office.
   The state agency said the FBI wanted more than lists of clients.
   If the names of fugitives appeared on the lists, the FBI wanted
division workers to contact the fugitives and tell them to visit the
downtown office for job interviews, according to state officials.
FBI agents would be waiting to arrest the job applicants.
   Hunter rejected the request on the advice of his staff and an
assistant state attorney general who said it could violate state
privacy laws and endanger division employees.
   The FBI offered to pay $2 for the name of each client and $300 to
$400 for a name if it turned out to be that of a wanted felon,
division officials said.
   Hunter said he would be willing to release such information on a
case-by-case basis.
   ``But they wanted more than just information,'' he said. ``This
was a sting-like operation.''
   During the past 20 years, the FBI has caught thousands of
fugitives by feeding such information into a national computer
system that checks the data against a list of about 25,000 currently
wanted criminals, said Charles Mathews, the assistant special agent
in charge of the Portland office.

   Saying the U.S. decision to bar PLO leader
Yasser Arafat from the country was ``firm and final,'' the State
Department on Monday gave its reluctant consent to moving the United
Nations debate on Palestinian issues to Geneva.
   There the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization could
air his views despite a U.S. finding that he was an ``accessory'' to
acts of terrorism against Americans and did not qualify for a visa
to enter the United States.
   ``It's unnecessary,'' department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
of the attempt by Arab diplomats to move part of this year's General
Assembly session to Geneva.
   He said other PLO officials present in New York could speak for
Arafat's group and, besides, a shift to Geneva would be costly.
   But, Redman acknowledged, if the United Nations decided to move
the debate out of the country ``the same factors would not be
applied in the same way.''
   Arafat would not require U.S. permission in order to speak, and
the judgment of L. Paul Bremer, director of the department's office
to counter terrorism, that the Palestine National Council has not
renounced terrorism would not be applicable.
   ``While we do not favor such a move we do not oppose it,'' Redman
said. He called discussion of a shift at this point only
hypothetical.
   The decision to bar Arafat was made Saturday by Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   Turning down an appeal from the United Nations for favorable
consideration, he concluded that Arafat ``knows of, condones and
lends support'' to terrorist acts against Americans by units of
Fatah, the dominant group in the PLO headed by Arafat. ``He is,
therefore, an accessory to such terrorism,'' Shultz said.
   The rebuff provoked criticism from Arafat and several Western
European and Arab governments as well as allegations the United
States was not living up to the terms of its 1947 agreement to be
the host for the U.N. headquarters.
   Redman said, however, ``this is a question of terrorism, security
and the security of American citizens.''
   The spokesman said the United States conditioned its acceptance
of the 1947 agreement on the right to bar entry of aliens ``in order
to safeguard its own security.''
   Redman sought, meanwhile, to separate the issue of a visa for
Arafat from problems in the Middle East. He said ``probably no other
country in the world has worked as hard at the peace process as the
United States has.''
   Shultz made four trips to the area this year in an unsuccessful
effort to promote negotiations between Israel and a joint delegation
of Jordanian and Palestinian Arabs.
   ``We do not oppose the General Assembly considering the
Palestinian question,'' Redman said. ``It's an important matter.''
   He said U.S. diploamts would participate in any U.N. debate.
   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States intended no affront to the United Nations by denying
Arafat's request for a visa.
   Briefing reporters at the White House a day after President
Reagan said that he agreed ``very much'' with Shultz's decision,
Fitzwater said ``we were making no kind of statement about the
United Nations, but about Yasser Arafat and terrorism.''
   Fitzwater took questions on the PLO issue shortly after Arafat
told reporters in Baghdad, Iraq, that the administration had
violated international law.
   ``I don't think many Americans are having much trouble
understanding this decision,'' the spokesman said.
   Sheila Tait, spokeswoman for President-elect George Bush, said
Bush was informed of the decision and ``stands behind it'' as a
member of the administration. Bush did not respond to a shouted
question on the matter during a White House appearance Monday.
   On Sunday, Stephen Hart, a spokesman for Bush, said he had not
been consulted in advance of Shultz's announcement.

   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who
was operated on for breast cancer Oct. 21, appeared to be wearing a
wig Monday during court arguments.
   Court spokeswoman Toni House declined comment when asked whether
O'Connor was wearing a wig and whether the justice is undergoing
chemotheraphy or radiation treatment.
   Hair loss frequently results from these post-surgical treatments.
   O'Connor, 58, returned to the bench on Oct. 31, 10 days after
surgery for breast cancer.
   O'Connor said in a statement at the time of the surgery that the
cancer was detected in an early stage and the prognosis is for a
full recovery.
   But she has declined to confirm whether she underwent a
mastectomy or to provide details about any subsequent treatment.

<HEAD>Midwest, Northwest, Appalachia Could Get Welcome Moisture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snows this winter could provide welcome relief
to drought-plagued areas of the Midwest, Northwest and Appalachia,
the National Weather Service projected Monday.
   The Southeast and Gulf Coast, meanwhile, appear likely to bask in
warmer than normal weather for the next three months, according to
the long-range forecast for December through February.
   ``This particular season, we think, is more likely to be warm
than cold, more likely to be wet than dry,'' said Dr. Donald L.
Gilman, the agency's chief long-range forecaster.
   Large areas of the middle of the country, including the northern
plains, remain a major question mark, however, with the forecast too
close to call in those regions, Gilman said.
   A major factor in the prediction is a pattern of cooler than
normal ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, Gilman said. Unlike
years when this area has been warm, the cooler conditions tend to
steer weather systems from the Pacific across Mexico and into the
Southeastern states, pumping warm air into that region.
   But Gilman pointed out that conditions in the northern Pacific
and Gulf of Alaska are unsettled, and changes there could upset the
outlook for California and the Northwest.
   ``This is a zone of great doubt,'' he said.
   The best news is likely that there is little severe cold in the
forecast, Gilman said.
   But, asked if that means that the warmer than normal conditions
of the past summer were continuing, he said no. The above normal
winter temperature forecast is not a continuation of that pattern,
nor is it a result of overall climate warming, he said.
   For some drought-affected regions the outlook for a wet winter is
good news, he said. ``The Midwest outlook is favorable for helping
recharge the soil.''
   The strongest chance for wetter than normal weather is in
Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, Gilman forecast.
   Also anticipating a wet winter should be Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, western Montana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, New
York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, western North Carolina, western
Virginia and eastern Tennessee.
   Dry conditions are expected from Southern California eastward
through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Florida and the
southern portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
   The outlook is too close to call in other areas, including the
northern Great Plains states, which have also suffered from drought
this year. But, Gilman noted, in that region the heaviest
precipitation is usually in spring rather than winter, so the
farming outlook could still be good for next year.
   Turning to temperatures, the only region with a below normal
outlook is Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern Iowa and eastern North and
South Dakota.
   Warmer than normal conditions are expected in Utah, Arizona, New
Mexico, most of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia,
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and all states to the south and east of
those.
   The odds of warmer than usual weather increase to the south and
east, the forecast notes.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Says Sandinistas Declaring War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan rebel commander Monday
said the Sandinista government has ended an eight-month cease-fire
by staging offensive military operations in eastern and northern
Nicaragua.
   ``We have alerted our combatants that the Sandinistas are
declaring war,'' said Enrique Bermudez in a broadcast over the
rebels' clandestine Radio Liberacion.
   The director of the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance umbrella
organization also said the Sandinistas received new shipments of
Soviet military aid since August. These included large numbers of
ground-based AC-2 and AC-3 missiles and Mi-17 helicopters, he said.
   Bermudez accused the government of seeking a military advantage
over the rebels, who have gone without U.S. military assistance
since Congress voted to cut off lethal aid in February.
   Since 1981 the Reagan administration has supported the rebels,
known as Contras, in their bid to overthrow the leftist government.
   In March, the Sandinistas and Contras signed a cease-fire
agreement in the southern town of Sapoa. Talks on a permanent truce
broke down in September and each side accuses the other of
cease-fire violations.
   ``The Sandinistas are saying that the Sapoa accords ended
definitively and that they are not going to continue negotiations,''
said Bermudez. He said the Sandinista army was conducting offensives
against Contra forces in the northern province of Matagalpa and
eastern Chontales province.
   ``We are going to continue defending ourselves in cases when
we're attacked,'' he said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega said the army was
``fulfilling the orders of President (Daniel) Ortega regarding the
end to offensive military operations, but we must be ready to reject
with force each criminal action that the Contras make.'' He was
quoted Monday in the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario.
   A government official Sunday said four Contras were killed in a
clash with government troops east of Managua, the capital.
   Fernando Caldera, Interior Ministry representative in Chontales,
also said 12 soldiers and defense ministry personnel and eight
civilians have been killed in rebel ambushes over the past two
months.
   Another 22 people, including 10 rebels and 12 civilian militia,
died Wednesday when guerrillas battled local defense forces in the
remote hamlet of El Guabo, 137 miles east of Managua, the government
said.

<HEAD>Bush Keeps Reagan Spokesman Fitzwater, Lunches With Dole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush announced Monday
that Marlin Fitzwater, President Reagan's spokesman for the past two
years, would keep his job in an example of ``continuity in the best
sense.''
   Bush also sought to make peace with a former rival, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, inviting the Kansas Republican to a
private lunch and declaring ``the focus is properly on looking to
the future.''
   Dole, who lost the GOP presidential nomination to Bush, agreed to
set any past animosities aside. ``The election is over and we both
have obligations and certainly mine is to help him become a great
president and I intend to do that,'' he said.
   The naming of Fitzwater represented yet another Bush selection
from the ranks of veterans of previous administrations. Asked when
the new faces he has promised would begin to appear, Bush said,
``Stay tuned for the changes. We'll be getting to them soon.''
   Transition sources said they expect the naming of former Sen.
John Tower as defense secretary and Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher as
commerce secretary later this week. However, the vice president gave
no clue as to when he'd name additional Cabinet choices.
   He showed up unexpectedly at Fitzwater's usual 11:30 a.m.
briefing in the White House to announce his decision to retain the
46-year-old career government spokesman, who had been his press
secretary in 1985-87.
   ``I think he's the best,'' Bush said. ``He represents the old and
the new. He represents the Reagan administration and he also
represents the Bush administration. ... This is continuity in the
best sense.''
   Fitzwater, with his own brand of self-deprecating humor, called
the offer ``a wonderful opportunity'' but added, ``I think I
represent the old and the older.''
   ``The transition should be a smooth one,'' Fitzwater joked. ``I
have a lot of ideas for my successor, but I haven't had a chance to
think about them yet.''
   Fitzwater said the new president would have news conferences ``as
regular as possible.''
   ``It's a new administration, a new president. I'm sure we'll have
new ways of dealing with the press. I'm sure there'll be all kinds
of interviews and press conferences and meetings,'' he added.
   Fitzwater has had the title assistant to the president for press
relations since Febuary 1987, when he succeeded Larry Speakes.
   Although Bush said that Fitzwater would be retained as ``press
secretary,'' that title is actually still held by James Brady, who
was wounded in the March 1981 assassination attempt on the president.
   When asked whether Brady would have a role in the new
administration, Fitzwater said, ``I know the vice president is very
interested in Jim and concerned about his well being'' and that Bush
and his advisers ``have some ideas of things they would like him to
do.''
   Fitzwater said Sheila Tate would remain Bush's press secretary
through the transition, and he would take over on Jan. 20. Ms. Tate
has said she plans to leave government.
   Fitzwater said Bush telephoned him early Monday, ``made the offer
and I quickly accepted.''
   At lunch, Bush and Dole dined alone for awhile, then were joined
by Bush's choice for budget director, Richard G. Darman, for a
discussion of budget issues.
   Bush said he hoped to work with Dole as well as with Democratic
leaders in forging a compromise to ease the government's budget
deficit. ``We're going to address this budget deficit early on,'' he
said.
   Dole, who said during the primary campaign that Bush should
``stop lying about my record,'' said Monday, ``We've both been
through some pretty rough campaigns.''
   Now, he said, ``the election is over. I vowed to the
president-elect we'd work together.''
   Bush told reporters he had gotten ``some very good ideas'' from
Dole on dealings with Congress
   ``Neither of us is naive. There'll probably be some times when we
differ with the majority party up there,'' he said. But he added
that he was confident he could work as president with GOP leaders in
both Senate and House ``and reach out to the Democrats as well.''
   Dole said the two just ``talked generally about timing'' but that
as soon as Bush wanted to get into specifics ``I'll be happy to
round up some senators and go to work.''
   Asked whether taxes needed to be raised to eliminate the deficit,
Dole responded with a flat ``no.''
   Bush, who voiced repeated opposition to new taxes during his
campaign and has talked of freezing overall federal spending at the
rate of inflation, said he would talk about specific budget cuts
``later on, but nobody's going to get home scot-free on these
things. Everyone knows that.''
   Bush planned to meet with other Senate Republicans at the Capitol
Tuesday morning, and was to attend a congressional GOP dinner at the
Library of Congress Tuesday night.

   NASA set an invisible countdown clock
in motion Monday for Thursday's launch of space shuttle Atlantis
with five military men who reportedly will deploy the $500 million
Lacrosse satellite to spy on the Soviet Union.
   NASA and the Pentagon say the flight and its cargo are
top-secret, but reports have circulated widely about the satellite,
and even the Soviet Union has discussed the mission through its news
agency, Tass.
   The weather could be a problem for launch day. A preliminary
forecast for Thursday called for overcast sky, brisk winds and
isolated rainshowers _ unfavorable conditions that would prevent
NASA from giving the go-ahead for liftoff.
   The astronauts flew here Monday afternoon from their training
base in Houston and their commander, Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson,
told reporters, ``We're ready to go; the crew is excited about the
mission, and we're anxious to be under way.'' He said he hoped for
good weather on Thursday.
   The crew members have been instructed not to discuss their
mission publicly, and when a reporter shouted a question about the
flight, Gibson smiled and replied, ``Good to see you.''
   The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, and the mission
specialists are Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross
of the Air Force, and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   The countdown started shortly after midnight, but because the
mission is classified, countdown displays normally monitored by the
news media were blank.
   NASA and the Defense Department made periodic reports that all
was well but said they wanted to keep the precise progress of the
count secret to hide the exact time of launch. No information has
been made public about the number or length of planned ``holds,''
when the clock would normally be stopped.
   Officials have said Atlantis will lift off sometime between 6:32
a.m. and 9:32 a.m. Thursday. Reliable sources have said the launch
will occur about 7 a.m. if weather and other conditions are adequate.
   Defense Department officials contend the secrecy makes it more
difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships operating off Cape
Canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the
Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, already know a great
deal about the mission.
   In fact, the official Soviet news agency Tass said Sunday: ``The
main task of the secret mission is to put into near-Earth orbit a
new generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse. The
satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the Soviet
Union with the help of updated radar. The Pentagon plans to deploy
in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will
play the role of an `eye' for the new strategic bomber B-2, known as
stealth.''
   U.S. critics also say that once Atlantis' satellite is in its own
orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what
it is doing.
   Knowledgeable sources report the satellite will gather extremely
sharp radar images of Eastern Europe and Soviet military targets as
it follows a course that covers 80 percent of the Soviet Union. A
major assignment will be to help American intelligence officials
verify Russian compliance with arms control treaties.
   The sources say the satellite is huge, that it weighs more than
30,000 pounds and, once deployed, it will extend two solar panels to
a span of 150 feet. They say its radar will be able to penetrate
clouds and they estimate the cost at more than $500 million.
   The flight will be the 27th for the shuttle program, the third
dedicated totally to the Defense Department and the second since the
Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986.
   The secrecy about Atlantis' launch contrasts sharply with the
fanfare that surrounded last September's flight of Discovery on the
first post-Challenger mission.

<TEXT>
   An attorney plans to argue Wednesday for a new
trial for Randall Dale Adams, whose guilt in the killing of a
policeman was questioned by the documentary film ``The Thin Blue
Line.''
   Adams was convicted nine years ago of the 1976 murder of Dallas
officer Robert Wood, and sentenced to death for the slaying. His
sentence later was commuted to life in prison.
   ``The Thin Blue Line'' suggests that police and prosecutors
virtually framed Adams by suppressing evidence of his innocence and
using five questionable witnesses.
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, contends Adams did not receive a
fair trial, largely because prosecutors did not turn over documents
favorable to the defense, as required by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Schaffer also said he plans to use evidence generated in the
making of the film at the hearing.
   Schaffer said he will question the credibility of five witnesses
who testified against Adams, including key witness David Ray Harris.
Harris originally testifed that Adams shot Wood while Harris and
Adams were riding together in a stolen car.
   But Harris now claims that Adams was not even in the car when the
fatal shots were fired.
   ``David Harris has essentially admitted in the past month that he
committed the capital murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood,''
Schaffer wrote in his application for a writ of habeas corpus, which
would bring the case to court again. ``(Adams) has been incarcerated
for almost 12 years for an offense which he did not commit.''
   Schaffer is asking state District Judge Larry Baraka to recommend
a new trial and Adams' release pending the trial. The judge will
make a recommendation to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Major Survey on Sex Harassment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is about to launch one
of the most extensive surveys ever undertaken to spotlight sexual
harassment in the workplace.
   The written survey will be distributed in December to more than
34,000 men and women on active duty in the armed forces, plus 4,000
in the Coast Guard, an agency of the Transportation Department. It
will ask if they have ever been the victims of ``uninvited, unwanted
sexual attention.''
   By contrast, the Merit Systems Protection Board, which conducted
a similar survey among civilian government workers last year, polled
a sample of about 13,000 full-time federal workers and received
responses from 8,500.
   The military survey was ordered last February by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in response to a recommendation from a
special task force. The panel concluded that sexual harassment was a
serious problem for women in the armed forces and that the services
should open additional jobs to females.
   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, said the confidential
survey will be distributed to 8,900 enlisted personnel and officers
in the Army, 8,900 in the Air Force, 8,600 in the Navy, 7,700 in the
Marine Corps and 4,000 in the Coast Guard.
   Approximately 21,000 men and 17,000 women are slated to receive
the questionnaires.
   Researchers hope some preliminary results will be available by
April, but a final report is not expected before June, Super said.
   The spokesman said the questions in the four-part survey are
designed to determine whether sexual harassment has been a problem
in the past and how serious a problem it is today. Service members
who have been harassed within the previous 12 months will be asked
to provide details of the experience.
   Respondents will be asked to offer a frank appraisal of how their
work productivity was affected by any incident of sexual harassment;
whether they reported the alleged harassment and requested any type
of investigation, and in what region of the country or area of the
world the incident occurred.
   Completion of the survey will be voluntary, but the response rate
is expected to be high because the Pentagon will ask military
commanders around the world to encourage participation.
   The survey by the Merit Systems Protection Board, which was
released in July, concluded that sexual harassment in the civilian
government world was ``pervasive, costly and systemic.''
   The board said 42 percent of women and 14 percent of men who
responded to its survey of federal employees said they experienced
some form of sexual harassment from May 1985 to May 1987. That
figure was virtually identical to findings in the board's 1980
survey.
   Super said the $35,000 Pentagon survey should provide basic
information to defense officials about how serious the problem of
sexual harassment is inside the military, the effectiveness of
existing regulations and what changes might be helpful.

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Resigns After Allegation of Plagiarism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A graduate student reading 20-year-old medical
journals discovered plagiarized passages that have resulted in the
resignation from Harvard Medical School of one of the nation's top
psychiatrists, a Harvard official said Monday.
   Dr. Shervert Frazier, a former head of the National Institute of
Mental Health, resigned last week as a Harvard professor and
director of McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital affiliated with
the university.
   The resignation followed an investigation by the medical school's
Faculty Conduct Committee, which concluded that plagiarism occurred
in four papers written by Frazier and published between 1966 and
1975, according to a letter from Dean Daniel C. Tosteson to the
medical school faculty.
   The letter, dated Nov. 23, was made public by the university
Monday. Both Frazier and Tosteson were out of town and unavailable
for comment Monday, said Harvard spokesman Peter Costa.
   Dr. S. James Adelstein, dean of academic programs at the medical
school, said Frazier, 67, did not dispute the committee's findings
but said the plagiarism resulted from lax methods, not deceptive
intent.
   ``He said that when he read a paper, he would copy parts of it
out,'' Adelstein said. Later, ``he put the cards together and was
not always as careful as he should have been,'' the dean said.
   ``If you look at these papers, what you see is that there are
paragraphs within them that are more or less verbatim from some
other places,'' Adelstein said.
   The articles were brought to the attention of school officials in
August by Paul Scatena, a 28-year-old graduate student at the
University of Rochester who was researching medical literature on
pain.
   Scatena said Monday that he was pleased by the job Harvard did
checking out his complaints. He said he sent copies of the articles
to Harvard, using ``color-coded highlighting'' to note the
similarities.
   ``I'm very glad that Harvard seems to be in the forefront of
tackling some of these ethical issues that are plaguing science
these days,'' Scatena said.
   Three of the four papers are about phantom pain, the burning
sensation that people sometimes feel from a limb that has been
amputated. The fourth is on ``psychiatric emergency management.''
   The plagiarized portions were taken from earlier articles in
Scientific American, Clinical Neurosurgery and other publications.
   Adelstein said the four papers appeared in medical review
journals or textbooks, including the American Handbook of Psychiatry.
   Frazier was a professor of psychiatry at Harvard from 1972 until
1984, when he left to become director of the National Institute of

<HEAD>Military Says Marcos Supporters Staged Attempted Coup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police charged five people with
illegal assembly after what the military said was an attempt by
supporters of Ferdinand Marcos to stage a mass uprising like the one
that toppled their exiled leader.
   President Corazon Aquino brushed aside Saturday's events, in
which troops turned back bus and jeep convoys carrying about 1,000
civilians into the city with leaflets promising a ``constitutional
military government.''
   Military officials said the convoy was organized by supporters of
Marcos, who has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted in a 1986
popular uprising.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, said convoy leaders planned to surround military
garrisons in the capital, much like the February 1986 uprising that
propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   But he said there was no evidence any soldiers had joined the
convoys, made up mostly of civilians from agricultural areas near
Manila.
   ``They were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed,''
Mrs. Aquino said. ``I guess people will keep on trying (to undermine
the government), but I think they should realize now that the people
are against them and they will not support them in something like
this.''
   Officials said most of those in the convoy were allowed to return
home after police questioning, but five people were charged on
Monday with illegal assembly. Police were looking for the alleged
ringleader, Jose Ocampo.
   Oxales said troops remained on alert Monday as a precaution.
Troops armed with semi-automatic rifles and machine guns were seen
guarding roadblocks on the eastern edge of the capital.
   Oxales said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewards
of up to $200,000 for the capture of senior military officers loyal
to Mrs. Aquino.
   Participants were offered money to join the convoy and were told
they would attend rallies at the presidential palace and elsewhere
to protest ``economic grievances,'' Oxales said.
   Participants also were given ``liberation bonds'' they were told
could be redeemed after the new government was installed, Oxales
said.
   Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs.
Aquino. The most serious took place Aug. 28, 1987, when about 2,000
mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital. At
least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded.
   Mutiny leader Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan was arrested
in December 1987 but escaped in April.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell says he has
delivered to the White House a petition containing about 2 million
signatures urging President Reagan to pardon Iran-Contra figure
Oliver North.
   Falwell said a pardon would save the Bush administration years of
trouble.
   Reagan has said the legal process should be allowed to run its
course in the North case. Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss did not
respond immediately Monday to a telephone inquiry about whether the
petition prompted any reaction from the White House.
   In May, the former national security aide delivered the
commencement address at the independent Baptist preacher's Liberty
University. At the ceremony, Falwell compared the prosecution of
North to the persecution and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
   ``This entire case has become a travesty at the taxpayers'
expense,'' Falwell said in a statement Friday.
   ``These court proceedings were initiated during President
Reagan's term and should be concluded during his term,'' Falwell
said. ``Clearly, this is now an impossibility. We, therefore, urge
the president to pardon North and spare him what could easily be
several years of legal battles and a serious and unnecessary burden
for the Bush administration.''
   North's trial is expected to start early next year.

<HEAD>Ethiopia Moving 600,000 Peasants into Villages by June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marxist government plans to move
600,000 peasants into villages by June, the Ethiopian News Agency
reported.
   The new program would bring to 14.9 million the number of people
relocated in villages since the program begun four years ago, the
state news agency said. That would be 40 percent of Ethiopia's rural
population, ENA said.
   The new quota was approved during a weekend meeting of the
National Villagization Coordinating Committee chaired by Prime
Minister Fikre-Selassie Wogderess.
   The program would include 12 of the nation's 14 administrative
provinces, it said.
   It did not identify the two uninvolved provinces but government
sources identified them as Eritrea and Tigray _ two neighboring
northern regions plagued by civil war.
   Secessionist Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in
Africa's oldest civil war while Tigrean guerrillas took up arms 14
years ago to press demands for autonomy.
   ENA said plans involve building 341 primary schools, with
construction of 231 to be financed by the Swedish International
Development Agency, the only international organization helping the
program.
   Most relief and aid organizations operating in Ethiopia have
refused to get involved in the relocation program because of
previous allegations peasants were forced to leave their homes, some
at gunpoint.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government has admitted making
some mistakes, but promised this year that future exercises would be
strictly voluntary.
   Critics say peasants are taken to ill-prepared barrack-like
villages where there often are none of the schools, health clinics,
and piped water which the government says it can provide to
centralized communities. Officials say they cannot bring such
necessities to traditionally isolated parents with neighbors living
miles apart in often rugged terrain accessible only by foot or mule.
   The government's opponents say it wants to use the program it
calls ``villagization'' to give it more control over its 47 million
people, who since the 1974 Marxist revolution all are organized by
rural farming or urban district associations that control things
like food rations.
   Ethiopia's agricultural policy is based on establishing state and
cooperative farms through centralized villages though they have
proved less productive than peasant farmers.

<HEAD>Insurer Of Ferryboat To Cover Costs To Remove Vessel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The insurer of a wrecked ferryboat has agreed
to pay $4 million to remove the vessel from a coral reef in Puerto
Rico that is the home of Hawksbill sea turtles, an endangered
species, the Justice Department announced Monday.
   The 3,568-ton ferry A. Regina ran aground on the reef off Mona
Island on Feb. 15, 1985, on a daily trip from Puerto Rico to the
Dominican Republic.
   The hull carved a deep trench in the reef, killing coral, and
fuel oil and debris damaged the reef, seabed and beaches, the
Justice Department alleged in a civil complaint filed in U.S.
District Court in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   Hawksbills, more than any other turtle species, depend heavily on
healthy coral reef habitat for shelter and food, said the complaint,
adding that much of the hope for their survival and recovery depends
on maintaining nesting beaches and foraging habitat.
   Under a proposed consent decree reached with Standard Steamship
Owners Protection Indemnity Association (Bermuda) Ltd., the
insurance company will pay $4.03 million to remove the ferry and
clean up debris.
   The commonwealth of Puerto Rico also is a party to the consent
decree, under which it will receive at least $641,000 for damages to
its natural resources, cleanup costs and future costs related to the
removal project.
   The consent decree was filed simultaneously with the complaint
against Standard Steamship and Armatur, S.A., and Tourship Co.,
S.A., the owners and operators of the ferry.
   ``The agreement provides an excellent plan to prevent further
damage to the ecology and to improve protection of sea turtles that
live on and around Mona Island,'' Assistant Attorney General Roger
Marzulla, head of the Justice Department's land and natural
resources division, said in a statement.
   Congress passed legislation authorizing the Corps of Engineers to
transfer a surplus barge to a salvage company to help carry out the
removal operation.

<HEAD>Father Seeks Visitation Rights for Daughter Given Away for Adoption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The natural father of a girl who was adopted at
birth more than seven years ago asked the Supreme Court on Monday to
restore parental rights he contends were revoked unconstitutionally.
   Edward McNamara contends that San Diego authorities
unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl, who
was conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eight
months before the baby's birth.
   McNamara, now 42, did not learn that he had become a father until
after the infant's birth and the mother sought his consent to put
the child, named Katie, up for adoption.
   McNamara sought custody soon after he learned of Katie's birth,
but California limits the rights of an unwed father to block an
adoption.
   Attorney James E. Sutherland argued that California law
unconstitutionally discriminates against unwed fathers by making it
more difficult for them to assert rights as parents.
   ``Mr. McNamara's rights shouldn't be terminated except on the
same grounds as the mother's,'' Sutherland told the justices, noting
that a lower court that denied custody had concluded nevertheless
that his client was a loving father of two sons by a previous
marriage.
   McNamara, who is now seeking visitation rights, ``was denied any
opportunity to form any relationship with the child'' before she was
put up for adoption by the mother, who is not identified in court
records.
   But several justices expressed skepticism over McNamara's claim
that he was denied equal protection or denied his rights when
authorities allowed the natural mother to place Katie up for
adoption without McNamara's consent.
   ``None of our cases hold that a father in your client's position
has achieved a protected liberty,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist
told Sutherland.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor questioned why California didn't have
authority to adopt a policy ``that the state will consider the best
interests of the child over the alleged rights of the biological
father.''
   O'Connor asked Sutherland if McNamara could make the same claim
if the child's conception ``had been the result of a so-called
one-night stand.''
   ``If he had perfected all the rights manifesting significant
parental interest, he would be entitled'' to make the claim,
Sutherland replied.
   ``That would go significantly beyond the court's cases, where
there had been an established relationship'' between father and
child, O'Connor said.
   Lloyd Harmon Jr., counsel for San Diego County, defended
California's policy of giving an unwed mother the primary right to
decide whether to surrender a child for adoption.
   The legal distinction between unwed fathers and unwed mothers
furthers the ``state policy which is the speedy placement of
children by putting them in suitable settings so they can nurture,''
Harmon argued.
   Most unwed fathers are not easily identifiable and ``are not
necessarily interested in fatherhood,'' he said.
   ``Biology in and of itself does not not create a substantial
relationship or create a parental right,'' Harmon said. ``There must
be something substantial between the father and the child.''
   The decision to allow Robert and Pamela Moses to adopt Katie was
``not an intrusion into an existing family unit. Mr. McNamara and
his daughter were never a family. They never had any relationship.''
   ``The most they saw of each other may have been an hour and a
half some seven years ago,'' Harmon said.
   The justices are expected to decide the case by July.
   Outside the courtroom, Mrs. Moses, who attended the hearing with
her attorney, refused to comment on the case.
   McNamara said he feels a ``great loss'' by ``not being able to be
her father.''
   He said he has pursued the lengthy legal battle because ``it is
my right to raise my daughter and I am not going to give that right
up to anyone.''

   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart says his
ministries are running in the black after months of red ink that
followed reports of his sexual misconduct.
   And, although Jimmy Swaggart Ministries wouldn't say how much
money was brought in by Swaggart's four-day Thanksgiving Camp
Meeting, the Thanksgiving Day collection alone totaled $400,000.
   ``I am speechless. I don't know what to say,'' Swaggart told the
crowd that nearly filled the 7,500-seat Family Worship Center on
Thursday night. ``I thank you, you'll never know how much I thank
you. My faith has been too little.''
   It was the first big crowd at a Swaggart camp meeting since
February, when he stepped down from the pulpit for three months
after a weepy confession to an unspecified sin.
   Since then, church attendance and contributions have dropped;
some stations have dropped his television show and the Assemblies of
God dropped Swaggart and threatened to expel ministries who stay
with him.
   Swaggart surprised the congregation at the camp meeting's opening
rally Wednesday by announcing a new contract to broadcast his show
in China. It will cost the ministry $250,000 a month, he said.
   The Rev. R.W. Schambach of Texas, who preached during the
meeting's afternoon sessions, told Swaggart the following evening
that the Thanksgiving afternoon crowd had given more than $400,000.
   And in the November issue of Swaggart's magazine, ``The
Evangelist,'' Swaggart wrote that the ministries operated in the
black during October.
   ``I've got to shout hallelujah a thousand times over,'' Swaggart
wrote. ``Last month, the month of October, the ministry met its
budget ... we paid our bills for that particular month.''
   However, he said, debts remain from the summer and he appealed
for donations.
   ``All the miracles we've won for the past 33 years of ministry
... will come to a grinding halt in the next two weeks if we cannot
pay the television stations the money we owe them,'' he wrote.
   Noting that January marks the 33rd anniversary of his ministry,
he asked people to send contributions in amounts that contained the
number 33.

   The United States is willing to meet with
Ethiopian officials to discuss ways to improve the strained
relations between the two countries, the State Department said
Monday.
   Spokesman Charles Redman made the comment after Ethiopian
President Mengistu Haile Mariam said in a New York Times interview
that Vice President George Bush's election to the presidency offers
a ``new opportunity'' for friendlier relations.
   ``We have always been willing to meet with Ethiopian officials
and discuss outstanding issues in our relationship. We agree with
President Mengistu's apparent assessment that improved relations
must be a step by step process,'' Redman said.
   Ethiopia is one of the most pro-Soviet countries in Africa. The
United States has had no ambassador in Ethiopia since 1980.

   Tornadoes skipped without warning like a
``big bouncing ball'' across North Carolina's capital city early
Monday, smashing homes and churches before heading into rural areas.
Four people were killed and at least 151 injured.
   ``I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and
then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought `Oh God, this is
it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said Betty Bell
of Raleigh.
   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.
   Monday's twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches,
toppled several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto
houses and streets, leaving more 6,500 homes without electricity for
several hours. Trees were snapped several feet from the ground along
the storm's path.
   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh, where the storms
struck without any advance notice, said Mayor Avery Upchurch. The
National Weather Service issued no tornado warnings or watches
before the tornadoes struck.
   Roger Friedenson, a spokesman for the Insurance News Service in
Raleigh, said insurance companies anticipated a possible loss of $30
million in North Carolina from the twisters. The 1984 storms cause
$65 million in damage.
   Joe Dean, secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety, said
twisters touched down in 17 locations in Wake, Nash, Franklin,
Northampton, Halifax, Dare, Hyde, Pamlico and Currituck counties.
   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,
damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswick
and Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.
   The twisters first struck around 1 a.m., flattening a Raleigh K
mart store and four three-story apartment buildings nearby at the
start of a 10-mile path of destruction in northern Wake County.
   ``We flew over the area and it looked like a big bouncing ball
had gone through there,'' Upchurch said.
   Three K mart employees in the Raleigh store when the tornado hit
were all later rescued. One man was trapped in debris and had to be
pulled out.
   ``I went to the back of the store and saw I couldn't make it,''
said K Mart employee Michelle Jones. ``I got to the toys and hid.''
   Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap
with racks of clothing and other merchandise.
   Fire departments had crews out combing through damaged homes and
apartments in search of other victims.
   However, said Raleigh City Manager Dempsey Benton: ``To our
knowledge, all people have been accounted for.''
   Of 132 houses damaged, a third were destroyed, he said.
   Raleigh police were posted at areas of major damage to prevent
looting, authorities said.
   The Salvation Army in Wake County coordinated donations of
blankets and clothing for four temporary shelters set up for people
left homeless.
   Tony DeVita, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex, said he grabbed a
pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed.
   ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every
window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going
to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the
corner of the room.
   The Small Business Administration has been asked to assess
damages to determine if the counties will be eligible for
low-interest disaster loans, Dean said.
   ``What we are trying to do now is assess the damage and determine
how to help people affected by the storm,'' Dean said.
   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,
state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12
bulk tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber,and two hog operations
were destroyed, he said.
   The victims were identified as Pete Fulghum, 12, of Raleigh;
Janet Barnes, 8, of Raleigh; and Lee Roy Alston and his wife, Mary,
of Nash County.
   Authorities first said six people had been killed. They later
said one of the deaths turned out to be unrelated to the storm. The
toll was revised downward a second time, to four, after a second
check of Wake County hospitals, the State Emergency Response Team
said in a news release.

<HEAD>Decision Expected Soon In River-Dredging Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SNEADS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida environmental officials expect to
decide soon whether to grant a controversial 25-year dredging permit
for the Apalachicola River, considered vital by shipping interests
in three states.
   But the permit requested by the Army Corps of Engineers is
opposed by nearly everyone else, including environmentalists and
fishing interests.
   ``If navigation survives and prospers, the economy of the region
benefits,'' said Homer Hirt, chief of the Jackson County Port
Authority in this Florida Panhandle river town.
   Hirt also is interim executive director of the Tri-Rivers
Waterway Association, which is lobbying for the permit on behalf of
shippers in the Panhandle, Alabama and Georgia.
   Environmentalists oppose the permit because they believe 25 years
is too long and because they contend the Corps of Engineers has
failed to state exactly what it plans to do. They also are worried
that the dredging would destroy habitat for fish and wildlife.
   Corps biologist Curtis Flakes said the agency will safeguard the
environment and that it has indicated what it intends to do through
publication of a navigation maintenance plan.
   The state Department of Environmental Regulation is expected to
make an internal decision in a few days, said David Arnold, a
spokesman for the agency.
   Congress in 1939 authorized the corps to maintain a navigation
channel in the river 100 feet wide and 9 feet deep, keeping both the
river and its northern tributaries, the Chattahoochee and Flint
rivers in Georgia and Alabama, open to traffic.
   But the corps still must obtain permits from each of the states
for dredging and removing snags such as fallen trees.
   Florida, which benefits least from the river traffic but has the
most to lose from an environmental standpoint, has used its muscle
over the years to reject some proposals and demand concessions
before approving others.
   Such permits usually are granted for no more than five years. A
25-year permit is unprecedented. The corps' current two-year permit
expires Jan. 31.
   Opposing the permit request are the Florida Defenders of the
Environment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine
Fisheries Service, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,
and the Apalachee Audubon Society.

   Environmental groups are going to have more to
say than ever before about what goes into the next farm bill, two
analysts said Monday.
   The environment probably would benefit from the abolition of all
government farm programs if current conservation incentives were
retained, said the study by Resources for the Future, an
environmental research organization.
   But would those benefits outweigh the social costs to farmers?
``The answer is probably not,'' said Katherine Reichelderfer, one of
two authors of the study published through the research group's
National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy.
   Such a policy would ``increase the number of acres planted to
crops, but would result in environmentally beneficial relocation and
mix of production activities, with less intensive and less damaging
use of agricultural chemicals on expanded acreage,'' the study said.
   But it added, ``farm income would decline, agricultural exports
would fall and rural communities and agribusiness interests would
suffer.''
   In the last revision of farm programs in 1985, environmentalists
were influential in forbidding benefits to farmers who convert
grassland and swamps to crops and in establishing a conservation
reserve in which farmers are paid rent to conat strikers occupying company
facilities held more than 173,000 boxes of bananas destined for
export. It said each box was worth $10.
   Yanez charged that United Brands was sponsoring radio
advertisements offering unemployed Hondurans jobs. Honduran labor
laws forbid employers to hire laborers to replace striking workers.
   The company also has distributed leaflets from helicopters at the
plantations urging strikers to return to work, union officials said.
   Leaders of other Honduran unions declared their support for the
banana pickers' strike.
   The National Campesino Association was ready to join the strikers
if necessary, said association president Luis Lagos. ``We have more
than 25,000 laborers (available) to defend the strike'' at United
Brands, he said.
   The Coordinating Council of Campesino organizations of Honduras,
with more than 300,000 members, also declared its support Monday.

   OPEC oil ministers ended nearly two weeks
of tense discussions Monday with a formal agreement to limit
production and pump prices back toward the cartel's benchmark of $18
per barrel.
   But before the day was out, one oil minister indicated his new
quota was not official, causing prices to back off after a sharp
runup.
   The accord, which ended the winter meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, set an output ceiling of 18.5 million
barrels a day for the 13 OPEC members, well under the 22.5 million
that analysts estimate the cartel is currently pumping.
   The agreement also resolved a key issue in the talks by giving
former combatants Iran and Iraq equal quotas of 2.64 million barrels
a day.
   After the agreement was announced, futures prices for West Texas
Intermediate, a major U.S. brand, jumped as high as $15.80 dollars a
barrel, up more than $1.80 from its close last week on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   But prices slipped toward the end of the day after the oil
minister of the United Arab Emirates said the output level set in
the accord was not his official ceiling.
   The price of West Texas Intermediate for January delivery still
managed to settle up $1.06 per barrel at $15.03.
   A pickup in crude prices _ if it holds _ could mean higher
gasoline prices at the pump, although oil companies do not
necessarily pass along the full increase.
   Each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically
means a pickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices.
   The agreement takes effect Jan. 1 for six months. OPEC President
Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria predicted prices could reach $18 a barrel
``maybe by June.''
   ``I wouldn't mind it tomorrow,'' he told a news conference, ``but
it's not possible.''
   He said that if the countries cut their production as required,
prices will get a strong lift.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, predicted the accord
``will have a very positive effect on the oil market.''
   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, predicted the
$18 mark could be reached by next winter.
   ``It's a victory for OPEC,'' said Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi,
oil minister of Iraq.
   Feredoon Barkeshli, senior Iranian delegate, said, ``I'm happy
about it.''
   Iran, which until the agreement had vowed never to permit Iraq an
equal quota, had a cap of 2.4 million under the cartel's previous
agreement and Iraq, 1.5 million.
   Iran retains its 14.27 percent share of total OPEC output under
the new accord. Iraq has the same portion.
   Other countries, however, lost a bit of their share to Iraq.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, was given a 24.5
percent share of total output, compared to 26.2 percent previously.
Its daily quota will be 4.52 million barrels, up from 4.34 million
barrels.
   The new agreement promises steps will be taken to try to keep
prices up and countries from cheating on their quotas. Past OPEC
agreements have unraveled when the members cheated by exceeding
their ceilings.
   The statement by Mana Saeed Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates
minister, hinted at early trouble with the agreement. But Paul
Mlotok, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the
statement ``shouldn't surprise anyone'' because of the country's
repeated overproduction in the past.
   He said he expected the agreement ``to largely hold. There's
going to be one main cheater (the United Arab Emirates).''
   ``As long as that is all,'' he said, ``they won't fare too
badly.''
   A critical element of the agreement was the inclusion of Iraq. It
refused to join the accord arranged in 1986, because it wanted the
same production ceiling as bitter rival Iran.
   ``We are happy to be back,'' said al-Chalabi.
   The meeting closed Monday with the approval of the agreement. The
next ministerial meeting will be June 5.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,
and Venezuela.

   Six Iranian clerics and three other men
were executed in Iran this month after being convicted of
corruption, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Monday.
   The executions, the latest in a series of executions announced by
the government in the past five months, heightened speculation of a
new power struggle within the Tehran regime.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said the men were executed after they
made ``explicit admissions'' of guilt.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, quoted Iranian
Intelligence Minister Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri as saying the
nine had been ``implicated in various offences.''
   ``Several pseudo-clergymen, including Omid Najafabadi, who was
arrested some time ago, were condemned to death after being tried,
and the executions have been carried out,'' Reyshahri said.
   Najafabadi, a former deputy in Parliament, was arrested in
December 1986 in connection with a scandal involving Mehdi Hashemi,
the brother of the son-in-law of Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri,
the designated successor of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Hashemi was executed last year for treason, terrorism and
kidnapping after he exposed Parliamentary Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani's clandestine contacts with the United States in the
arms-for-hostages deal.
   His execution brought into sharp focus the infighting between
governing factions in Tehran.
   The IRNA report confirmed a claim earlier this month by Iran's
main opposition group, the Iraqi-based People's Holy Warriors, that
a group of clergymen had been executed on Khomeini's orders.
   Dissident Iranian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
claimed at the time that the victims were linked to Montazeri. The
sources said Montazeri had ``vehemently protested'' to Khomeini
``the wave of mass executions'' that began in July.
   The regime has blamed the stabbing death Wednesday of former
Health Minister Kazem Sami on the People's Holy Warriors, but the
dissidents said Monday that the killing was ``carried out on
Khomeini's personal order.''
   The Iranian dissident sources say that the recent executions are
part of a systematic campaign by Rafsanjani's faction to eliminate
Montazeri's supporters.
   The power struggle centers on efforts by various groups to gain
supremacy after the death of the 88-year-old Khomeini, who is
reported in poor health.
   Montazeri faces considerable opposition from powerful political
figures such as Rafsanjani. The power struggle appears to have
intensified after Khomeini's decision to accept a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war _ a move opposed by
hardliners in Tehran.
   The People's Holy Warriors claimed that Khomeini and Rafsanjani,
who as Iran's acting commander-in-chief is the most powerful figure
after the revolutionary patriarch, ``want to make it abundantly
clear ... that the consequence of non-conformity or dissent, even
within the regime, is death.''
   A U.N. report on human rights in Iran issued in early November
criticized Iran for carrying out ``a wave of executions'' of
opposition members following the cease-fire in the war.
   The dissident Iranian factions have said that more than 1,100
activists were executed before the cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   Iran announced Friday it will allow the first visit by U.N. human
rights investigators by the end of December in hopes of refuting the
reports of mass executions.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls for a New Look at Decentralization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With investigations of abuse going forward in
nearly a fifth of the city's local public school districts, Mayor
Edward I. Koch asserted Monday that decentralization should be
re-evaluated.
   ``I'm not telling you decentralization is all bad, but it can't
be all good,'' Koch told reporters at City Hall after a weekend in
which allegations of sexual extortion surfaced in the probe of
cocaine use and other misconduct in the Bronx.
   ``There's no question in my mind that the local school boards
leave a lot to be desired,'' Koch said.
   District Attorney Paul Gentile's revelation that school board
members in the Bronx have been accused of demanding sex from
teachers in return for jobs and promotions has made the burgeoning
scandal ``more shocking than when the matter first came to public
attention,'' Koch said.
   In another weekend disclosure, Robert F. Wagner Jr., president of
the central Board of Education, told the New York Post that the
schools' inspector general was investigating District Boards 4 and 5
in Manhattan and 16 and 32 in Brooklyn as well as Boards 9 and 12 in
the Bronx, already under investigation by the district attorney.
   Green has suspended the District 9 board pending results of the
investigation, an action the board planned to challenge in court.
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green reiterated Monday in a
television interview that ``decentralization is on trial.''
   ``These people are elected, they're not appointed,'' Green said
on the ``CBS Morning News.'' ``We would expect that if they're going
to make decentralization work, we're going to have to agree to a
different set of rules than have been operating in some school
districts.''
   Green, Koch and Wagner planned to go to Albany on Tuesday to
continue lobbying the Legislature to bar politicians from running
for local boards and using them as bases for power and patronage.
   They also want to return to the chancellor more power over
principals of elementary and intermediate schools.
   Decentralization took effect 18 years ago over the opposition of
50,000 teachers, whose bitter strike divided the city on racial
lines. It put control of the 800 schools for kindergarten through
eighth or ninth grade in the hands of 32 locally elected district
boards. The high schools remained under jurisdiction of the central
board.
   The principle of community control, in numerous instances,
yielded to the reality of 5 percent voter turnouts for school
elections, which effectively turned the boards over to the
politically organized.
   The current scandal began unfolding in the Bronx early this month
when Matthew Barnwell, principal of P.S. 53 in District 9, was
arrested on a charge of buying crack.
   Green suspended Barnwell, but was criticized for failing to
follow up politically by going to the district to show concern and
using the incident to seek power to get rid of inferior but
tenure-entrenched principals.
   In the days that followed, Green hardened his line, which
included reversing his opposition to drug testing.
   He announced last week that a new policy on testing for teachers
and principals suspected of drug use would be taken up by the board
Dec. 7.
   Gentile said over the weekend that at least two members of local
school boards in the Bronx have offered to cooperate with his
investigators. He did not identify either the members or their
boards.
   Among the main allegations reportedly before the grand jury in
the Bronx were that some school board members used cocaine regularly.

<DATELINE>VINA DEL MAR, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet lashed out
at the United States and its former ambassador to Chile, saying he
``did nothing but make political propaganda against the government.''
   Ambassador Harry Barnes left Chile on Saturday after three years
as the U.S. envoy without the customary farewell meeting with the
president.
   In a speech Sunday in Vina del Mar, a coastal resort city 120
miles northwest of Santiago, Pinochet said he had snubbed the
ambassador.
   ``I did not shake his hand, I did see him off, I did not say
goodbye,'' said Pinochet.
   During his tenure, Barnes had angered the government by promoting
greater political freedom and meeting with opposition leaders and
human rights activists.
   Barnes' replacement, Charles Gillespie, who is U.S. ambassador in
Colombia, is expected to arrive in early December.
   Pinochet, speaking to his right-wing supporters, accused the
United States of trying to subjugate Latin America by sowing dissent
and by keeping its inhabitants in debt.
   ``Why did they give millions of dollars to the opposition?'' he
said. ``Because they know this government ... doesn't accept that
they come to enslave us, to subjugate this tiny country of
12,500,000 inhabitants, that they impose an envoy who does nothing
but make political propaganda against the government.''
   Congress last year voted to provide $1 million to organizations
promoting democracy in Chile, which has been ruled by Pinochet since
he led a bloody 1973 military coup.
   Pinochet contends that foreign financing of the opposition helped
to defeat him in an Oct. 5 referendum.
   The ballot gave Chileans the option to vote ``yes'' if they were
in favor of the general remaining in power until 1997, or ``no'' if
they opted for a free election whose winner would take office in
1990.

   American farm export volume hit a six-year peak
of 147.5 million metric tons in the year ended Sept. 30, with Japan
again the biggest customer, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   In dollar terms, U.S. agricultural exports climbed from $27.87
billion in fiscal 1987 to $35.2 billion this past year, a gain of 26
percent, while imports of farm products were up 2 percent to a
record $21 billion, USDA said.
   That left the United States with a net agricultural trade surplus
of $14.2 billion in black ink for fiscal 1988, compared with $7.22
billion a year earlier.
   Export volume rose 14 percent from the 129.2 million metric tons
posted in fiscal 1987, with wheat accounting for two-thirds of the
increase, USDA said.
   A metric ton is equivalent to about 2,205 pounds.
   Wheat exports climbed from 28.2 million metric tons in 1987 to
40.5 million tons in the last fiscal year. The Soviet Union and
China together purchased a total of 14.6 million tons of that
amount, or 36 percent of all U.S. wheat shipments in fiscal 1988.
   The Soviet Union and China together imported 4.95 million metric
tons of American wheat, or 18 percent of total shipments, in 1987.
   Japan led all customers, importing 27.8 million metric tons of
U.S. agricultural goods. Other leading purchasers were: the European
Community, 25.5 million metric tons; the Soviet Union, 15.9 million
metric tons; South Korea, 8 million; and Taiwan, 7.3 million.
   In addition to wheat, considerable tonnage gains were posted by
corn, grain sorghum, feeds and fodders and vegetable oils. Among
products not measured on the basis of metric tons, the biggest gains
were in baby chicks, live animals, fruit juices, wines and malt
beverages.
   The surging gains, however, were moderated a bit by weakened
foreign demand for U.S. soybeans, soybean meal and rice.
   The Agriculture Department said all leading foreign markets grew
in fiscal 1988 except that of the European Community, whose imports
of U.S. agricultural goods dropped nearly 1.1 million metric tons.
The decrease mainly reflected fewer purchases of soybean and soybean
meal.
   Indeed, the Soviet Union and Japan were among the five
fastest-growing markets for U.S. agriculture, joining China, Algeria
and India.
   On the dollar value side, American high-value exports such as
livestock and horticultural products climbed to a record $16.4
billion in 1988, a gain of $2.7 billion or 19 percent over the 1987
level. It also represented a $1.1 billion gain over the previous
peak, reached in 1981.
   Exports of bulk commodities shot up 33 percent from 1987 to a
total of $18.8 billion. The level topped $25 billion in 1984 before
immense crop surpluses and stiffer foreign competition battered
prices and sent American agriculture into the doldrums.
   Increased purchases of wheat and corn were the main reason for
the increase, USDA said. It said the Soviet Union, China and North
Africa were the leading markets for wheat and Japan, while the
Soviet Union and South Korea were tops for corn.
   Agricultural imports of $21 billion were some $250 million or 2
percent above the 1987 level and about $100 million over the 1986
mark of $20.9 billion, the previous record high. USDA said the
increase was not limited to any single commodity group but instead
reflected modest increases in nearly all major competitive items.
   Top suppliers were: the European Community, $4.12 billion;
Canada, $2.37 billion; Mexico, $1.9 billion; Brazil, $1.9 billion
and Australia, $1.15 billion. Products reflecting increases were
vegetable oil, live cattle, beef and veal, wines and malt beverages
and nursery products.
   There were drops in imports of sugar, pork, fur, coffee and
spices.

<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice, the 3-month-old daughter of the
Duke and Duchess of York, will be christened by the Archbishop of
York on Dec. 20, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The christening will take place in the historic Chapel Royal in
London's St. James's Palace, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
were married in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, the palace said.
   The font was made for the christening in 1840 of Princess
Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria, and it has been used
to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children and grandchildren. The
christening robe has been worn by all royal babies since the baptism
of Victoria's eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, in 1842.
   The christening will take place shortly after the princess'
father, Prince Andrew, returns to Britain. A Royal Navy lieutenant,
he is serving on board the destroyer Edinburgh which has been in the
Far East.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of the prince,
the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Buckingham Palace said the royal couple chose Dr. John Habgood,
the archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the Church of
England, rather than the Archbishop of Canterbury, the church's
spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of ``personal
and appropriate'' reasons.
   The queen, as Princess Elizabeth of York, was also christened by
the then- archbishop of York but in the chapel at Buckingham Palace.

   A couple in this rural Rhode Island
community have stopped paying taxes on 11 acres of land because they
don't know where it is, but that hasn't deterred town officials from
plans to sell the parcel for back taxes.
   The land has been taxed since 1970 even though it apparently does
not exist.
   In that year, Victor Nascimento of East Providence and a brother,
now dead, bought the land, near an old Boy Scout camp, for $2,100.
   They obtained a quit-claim deed on the property, which protects
the seller from responsibility if a problem is revealed in the
title, because they did not have enough money to spend on a title
search and survey, Nascimento said.
   Nascimento and his wife, Lois, intended the purchase to be an
investment. Without ever inspecting the land, they paid a total of
$2,500 in taxes between 1970 and 1985, when a town official informed
Mrs. Nascimento that the lot's status was in question.
   The couple now are seeking to get their money back.
   Nancy Hinchliffe, the town's tax assessor, said the company that
drew up the town's first tax maps in 1972 left the Nascimento
property out because it couldn't find it. She said the Nascimentos
were informed ``back in the 1970s'' that the deed did not represent
specific property, but they paid their taxes anyway.
   Hinchliffe said taxes must be levied against all deeds registered
with the town, even if the deeds stand for nothing.
   Linda Czerkiewicz, the town tax collector, said the rules also
call for property to be sold if taxes are more than two years
delinquent.
   However, Czerkiewicz admitted, ``I can't understand people buying
property not knowing where it is.''

   A 17-year-old youth who was to be
tried as an adult pleaded guilty Monday to attempting to murder the
editor of Canada's largest Punjabi-language newspaper.
   Harkirat Singh Bagga told the provincial court bail hearing he
did not want a lawyer appointed to represent him. He will be
sentenced Dec. 12.
   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. If he was tried
as a juvenile, his maximum sentence would have been three years.
   Tara Singh Hayer, 52, was shot Aug. 26 at least three times at
close range with a .357 magnum revolver while in his office in this
Vancouver suburb. He was hit in the spine, arm and thigh and remains
in hospital, paralyzed from the waist down.
   Hayer is editor of the weekly Indo-Canadian Times, a
Punjabi-language newspaper with a circulation of 15,000. He also is
editor and owner of the weekly English-language Express and a
glossy, monthly Punjabi magazine.
   About 15,000 people of Punjab orgin live in Canada, including
10,000 in British Columbia.
   Only days before he was shot, Hayer had denied a published report
suggesting he was a target in a contract killing that went awry when
the hired assasin turned out to be a police informant.
   He was not under police protection at the time he was shot.

<HEAD>Chess Federation Delay Ban on Players Who Competed in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The congress of the International Chess
Federation on Monday decided to postpone a decision on whether to
ban a player for life and strip him of his grandmaster title for
competing in South Africa.
   Miguel Quinteros of Argentina, already banned from competitions
for three years following two visits to South Africa, played a
six-game exhibition match in Johannesburg in September.
   Silvanus Ebigwe of Nigeria, chairman of the federation's
Commission on South Africa, also recommended to delegates that
Quinteros's name be erased from all future documents of the
127-member governing body of chess, known by its French acronym,
FIDE.
   While the proposal received strong African support, others
questioned the severity of the proposed action against the
40-year-old Argentinian and whether a title gained in competition
could ever be removed for a political act.
   ``While I agree we should certainly not send teams to South
Africa, we are not talking about teams, we're talking about
individuals,'' said Ian Josephs, a British citizen representing
Monaco.
   ``We are not policeman. We are here because we love chess. You're
trying to stop the man working for the rest of his life and he's not
here to speak. He's got no representation. What kind of justice is
that?'' said Josephs, whose speech was applauded by some delegates.
   Georgios Makropoulos of Greece said the rights of one or two
individual players must be set against the rights of many others in
Africa.
   Eventually, the decision was postponed until the next FIDE
congress, scheduled for August in Puerto Rico.
   The proposed banning for one year of Grandmaster Karl Robatsch of
Austria for competing in a South African event also was postponed
until August.
   FIDE President Florencio Campomanes of the Philippines said he
would contact Robatsch and Quinteros before the August congress.
   South Africa membership of FIDE was revoked in 1982 because of
its policy of apartheid.

   Conservationists urged adoption Monday
of a rule that would reopen Florida waters to limited redfish
harvests after a 19-month ban, but commercial fishermen don't like
the proposed season.
   Gov. Bob Martinez and the state Cabinet are scheduled to consider
the rule Dec. 6. If approved, recreational anglers could be catching
redfish within a month. Commercial harvests would remained banned.
   Once sought for the famed Cajun-style blackened redfish, the fish
was overharvested and in danger of depletion when the state ordered
a halt in April 1987 to all redfish harvests from Florida waters and
sales of Florida redfish.
   Since stocks have rebounded, the Marine Fisheries Commission has
suggested allowing one redfish catch per person a day during the
nine-month season. Eligible fish would be 18 to 27 inches long to
protect breeding fish, and no sales of the fish would be permitted.
   ``We are convinced that this recommended rule is the most
equitable way to allow a very limited harvest while insuring the
protection and future of this valuable marine resource,'' said Ted
Forsgren, director of the Florida Conservation Association.
   But Jerry Sansom, director of the Organized Fishermen of Florida,
said the species has recovered more than enough to support
commercial harvests, and he accused the conservationists of trying
to mislead the public and state officials.
   He said the proposed daily bag limit could amount to 750,000
redfish caught each year _ up to 50 times the number harvested each
year of snook, the next most-abundant game fish.
   ``It's better for them certainly, but it's not better for us.
They're saying they can't allow the commercial fisherman to harvest
any because there aren't enough,'' said Sansom. ``If that's a very
limited harvest, we've just invented some new words.''
   Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas have banned redfish
harvests. Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico also are closed to
redfish harvests.

   Concerned calls from citizens about a
white goose stuck in the ice on a park lake precipitated an
elaborate rescue effort likened to the recent whale saga at Barrow,
Alaska.
   ``We had our own version of the Soviet icebreaker'' that
eventually freed the Alaskan whales, said police dispatcher Lori
Burbach of Sunday's episode.
   The goose was trapped in thin ice 40 feet from shore on the lake
adjoining the Littleton Historical Museum.
   The rescue took four hours of effort by three policemen, state
Division of Wildlife workers and parks employees.
   ``Patrolman Bill Christensen said that the wildlife division guy
and the South Suburban (Parks) guy put a johnboat on the ice, then
the two of them _ kind of like the whales _ they had to break it
(the ice) with shovels and an ax to get it to float'' to the goose,
said fire dispatcher Susan Jones.
   ``It probably cost the city $300,'' she added, but said the
public outcry would have been intense if the rescue had not been
undertaken.
   News that a television crew was on its way to the rescue scene
``helped step it up a little bit,'' Burbach said.
   The goose waddled off with the rest of its flock after the
rescue, Burbach said.

   Marlin Fitzwater had scarcely finished saying
how grateful he was to be asked to continue as White House spokesman
in the new administration when a reporter asked him:
   ``Will you keep avoiding briefings?''
   Fitzwater glanced at his watch. ``A two-minute honeymoon,'' he
grinned. ``Amazing.''
   The exchange illustrated two things about Fitzwater's two-year
tenure as President Reagan's chief link with the press: The job has
conflict built into it, and Fitzwater is good at deflecting the
conflict with humor.
   Fitzwater, 46, a cigar-smoking former Kansas journalist who has
spent most of his career in government, was tapped by
President-elect George Bush Monday to be his press secretary.
   Bush said he chose Fitzwater, who was his vice presidential press
secretary from 1985 to 1987, because ``I think he's the best.''
   The spokesman has received high marks from many reporters
covering the White House. But there also have been complaints that
he is too easygoing and too often skips his daily White House
briefings for reporters.
   Fitzwater was philosophical about the criticism.
   ``Facing the White House press corps every day is no day at the
beach,'' he said.
   As to how long he would remain, he said, ``I figure you do this
job the way you run the quarter mile. You run as long and hard as
you can and as fast as you can, and when you drop they bring in
someone else.''
   He said the offer from Bush, which came in a telephone call to
his office at 8:30 in the morning, came as a surprise.
   ``I was making plans to leave,'' he said. He said he would call
his two children and tell them the news as soon as they got out of
school. Fitzwater, divorced, has a son and daughter.
   Fitzwater's selection marks the first time any incoming president
has chosen as his permament press secretary the same individual who
did the job for his predecessor. President Kennedy's press
secretary, Pierre Salinger, stayed on briefly after Kennedy's
assassination 25 years ago, but President Lyndon B. Johnson soon
replaced him with Bill Moyers.
   Fitzwater grew up on a farm in Abilene, Kan.
   As a high school student, he planted tulips at the Eisenhower
Library in Abilene. ``There was a huge picture of Ike and Jim
Hagerty (Eisenhower's press secretary),'' he said in an interview
last year. ``Even then I wondered what it would be like'' to have
that job.
   He landed it in February, 1987, after Larry Speakes resigned.
Speakes had taken over the duties from James Brady, who was
seriously wounded in an attempt on the president's life in March,
1981.
   The job pays $77,400 a year.
   Bush said he had asked Fitzwater to remain as press secretary,
the title that normally goes with the position of presidential
spokesman. In the Reagan administration that title had been reserved
for Brady.
   Asked if Brady would have a role in the new administration,
Fitzwater said Bush had ``raised the question internally'' and that
the vice president and his advisers ``have some ideas of things they
would like him to do.''
   From 1981 until 1983, Fitzwater was press spokesman at the
Treasury Department.
   Earlier, he served nine years as a spokesman at the Environmental
Protection Agency after working as a speechwriter for
then-Transportation Secretary John Volpe and at the Appalachian
Regional Commission.
   He was a deputy White House press secretary from 1983 to 1985,
when he joined the vice president's staff.
   He was a correspondent and editor with a number of Kansas
newspapers before coming to Washington.
   Fitzwater made no commitments as to how often Bush would meet
with reporters, but said, ``I knew him before to be an open person
willing to deal with the press and I think he will be again.''

<HEAD>North Wants To Bar Prosecutors From Hearings on Secret Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential aide Oliver L. North on
Monday moved to exclude independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh from
closed court hearings on secret documents the Iran-Contra prosecutor
wants to use as evidence.
   In a brief filing, defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell for permission to file a motion to bar Walsh and
his associates from attending hearings set to begin Wednesday.
   Defense lawyers, meanwhile, dismissed as ``mere spin control'' a
prosecution allegation that the former National Security Council
aide was threatening to reveal government secrets to scuttle charges
against him.
   No reason was given for North's request to exclude prosecutors
from the hearings, which will consider defense objections to
deleting sensitive references from some 350 prosecution exhibits.
   But the former presidential aide's lawyers presumably are set to
argue that allowing Walsh and his associates to attend the hearing
would give them an unfair preview of the defense's case.
   The government has granted Walsh permission to use the 1,000
pages to 2,000 pages of classified material as evidence against
North in a public trial, provided certain sensitive information is
deleted.
   The references include names of countries, foreign officials and
U.S. intelligence agents operating abroad.
   North has objected to virtually all the proposed deletions, and
Gesell ordered him to show why the references are important for
defending charges he conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Last summer, Gesell gave North an opportunity to detail why he
needed classified documents at a closed hearing to which the
prosecution was not invited.
   A spokesman for Walsh's office said the independent counsel would
oppose North's request to bar prosecutors from the hearings.
   North, meanwhile, urged Gesell to reject Walsh's request that he
be prohibited from using as defense evidence some 40,000 pages of
classified documents.
   Walsh contended that North listed many of the documents in his
Nov. 14 notice simply to ``provoke a dismissal'' of the charges
against him by threatening to disclose some of the nation's
best-kept secrets.
   But North's lawyers said Gesell should reject Walsh's assertion
``that we have somehow threatened national security or engaged in
`graymail' by taking the first step, required by statute, to protect
this nation's secrets.''
   The lawyers urged rejection of what it called Walsh's ``frontal
assault on defendant North's fundamental Fifth and Sixth Amendment
right to present a defense.''
   ``Under the (independent counsel's) perverse regime, the trial
would not be a search for truth; witnesses could not tell what they
knew about the facts; critical documents would never be presented to
the jury; and the verdict would rest upon a distorted sliver of
information selected almost entirely by the prosecution.''
   No date has been set for North's trial, the first of four ordered
by Gesell for the conspiracy charges against the former presidential
aide, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.

   Nearly 440 Americans died on the nation's highways
over the long holiday weekend as millions took to the roads to visit
family and friends in celebration of Thanksgiving.
   The number of highway fatalities this year was 438, down from
last year's total of 494 during the four-day Thanksgiving period,
which for counting purposes extended from 6 p.m. local time
Wednesday to midnight local time Sunday.
   The highest toll for the holiday was recorded in 1968, when 764
people were killed.
   The National Safety Council said about 390 people could be
expected to be killed on the highways during a four-day, non-holiday
weekend at this time of year.
   California, with 59 highway deaths, reported more fatalities than
any other state. Florida was second with 35. Four states _ Alaska,
Idaho, Montana and New Hampshire _ reported no deaths.

<TEXT>
   A painting by Edouard Manet worth more
than $1 million was stolen from the wall of a Long Island museum,
probably as patrons in the same room watched a videotape, police
said Monday.
   The theft at the Heckscher Museum occurred between 3:30 p.m. and
4:40 p.m. Sunday, with the museum open, lights on and guards
patrolling.
   The Impressionist painting, ``Bouquet of Peonies,'' completed in
1880 by Manet, is a still life of red and pink flowers in a glass
vase. The painting's owner, who had lent it to the museum, wishes to
remain anonymous, said John Hadley, chairman of the museum's board
of trustees.
   ``She is sunk by the whole thing,'' he said.
   International art dealers, the FBI and the international police
agency Interpol have been contacted to help retrieve the oil
painting, according to Lt. William Kiley of the Suffolk County
police.
   A visitor said he had seen the painting at about 3:30 p.m., then
turned around to view a 15-minute videotape on an N.C. Wyeth exhibit
being shown in the same room.
   When he returned to look at the painting at about 4:40 p.m., it
was gone.
   Kiley said the painting probably was taken during a showing of
the videotape.
   The thief apparently took the painting from the wall, walked
about 35 feet to the front door and got away, said Kiley.
   He said the painting, in its gold antiqued frame, measures about
16{ by 21{ inches and could easily have been concealed under
someone's coat.
   Two uniformed security guards were patrolling the five display
rooms, Kiley said.
   Museum officials said alarm systems were in place and working,
although they would give no information about the alarms. But
Detective Frank Barreiro, one of the first investigators on the
scene, said there apparently was no alarm system on.
   A companion painting, Manet's ``Roses, Tulips and Lilacs in a
Crystal Vase,'' on loan from the same owner, was hanging to the
right of the stolen piece. It was immediately taken down by museum
personnel and placed in a storage vault.
   ``At first she (the owner) wanted it back, but I think now she is
content that we have it in a safe place,'' said Hadley.
   About 200 people, some from out of state, visited the museum
Sunday, and about 26 visitors were in the museum when the theft was
discovered. Many of the visitors who signed a guest book on Sunday
were being interviewed by police.
   ``At this point we have no suspects,'' said Kiley.
   The exact value of the work was not disclosed over concern of
possible ransom by the thieves or help in marketing the work. Kiley
and Hadley both said it was worth more than $1 million.
   Patricia Reiss, a spokeswoman for the town of Huntington, which
owns the museum, said town officials will be meeting with its
insurance company to discuss a settlement on the stolen property.
   It was the first theft of artwork from the museum, which was
built in 1920, Reiss said.

   Dustin Hoffman, known as a hard-working
perfectionist on a movie set, says his newest costar, Tom Cruise, is
equally driven.
   In the upcoming ``Rain Man,'' Hoffman, 51, plays an autistic man
with remarkable powers of memory _ and a $3 million inheritance.
Cruise, 26, plays his brother, who wants the money.
   Hoffman says he has read about how difficult he is to work with,
so obsessed with detail that one director reportedly called him a
``microsurgeon.''
   ``In this age we live in, one has to be labeled something,'' he
said in the December issue of Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``You have to
be either a drug addict or a perfectionist or a hothead or a rebel
or a helluva nice guy. And I really didn't have any moniker attached
to me for a long time, except for being short and funny-looking.''
   As for Cruise, Hoffman says, ``He's a demon. He gets up early, he
works out, he goes home early, he studies, he works out again at
night. ... And he always wanted to rehearse.''
   Cruise, who starred with Paul Newman in ``The Color of Money,''
said he learned from his experience.
   ``What you get from great actors like Newman and Hoffman is where
to focus your energies and what to worry about and what not to worry
about,'' Cruise said. ``Because as a young actor, you're worried
about everything.''

   Tahnee Welch says she won her part in ``Cocoon''
on merit _ not because she is the daughter of Raquel Welch.
   ``They said I never paid my dues,'' Welch said in an article in
the December issue of Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``It's like what I was
doing didn't count. Like I cheated. But the point is not the
advantages I had but what I'm doing with them.''
   Welch, 26, said it was difficult growing up the child of a sex
symbol, but did not fault her mother.
   ``She's a hard worker. She's always taken care of herself. My
mother has never, never, never been supported by anyone. ... So I
had it in my mind that I had to do it myself. I have this pride,''
Welch said.
   It irritates her ``when people say I got help from my mother in
my career. The people from ``Cocoon'' did call my mother to ask her
to convince me to take the film,'' Welch said.
   That was a futile gesture, because, she said, ``My mother
couldn't tell me to do anything.''

<TEXT>
   Estonia's Communist Party chief has defied Moscow
by saying his republic ``will not retreat'' just because the Kremlin
objects to its declaration of sovereignty.
   A spokesman said party leader Vaijno Vyalyas declared on Estonian
television Sunday night that the rejection of the republic's
declaration ``doesn't mean we'll accept the decrees of Moscow.''
   Vyalyas' statements intensified the constitutional crisis as the
federal parliament prepared to revise the charter.
   Estonia's legislature voted almost unanimously Nov. 16 to declare
the tiny Baltic republic independent of Moscow in all but defense
and foreign affairs. It said new laws passed by the national
parliament would not apply in Estonia unless the legislature
approved them.
   Valle Feldman, spokesman for the Estonian Foreign Ministry,
quoted Vyalyas as saying in the televised speech Sunday night: ``We
will not retreat.'' Feldman was reached by telephone in Tallinn,
capital of Estonia.
   The party leader's remarks were broadcast shortly after a report
on national television of the meeting of the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet at which Estonia's declaration of sovereignty was
declared unconstitutional.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, chairman of the Presidium, said
in his speech to the parliamentary executive body: ``If we took this
road to division, it would slow down development and result in huge
losses. It runs counter to the entire course of perestroika,
economic reform and democratization of public life.''
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's name for his program of economic and
social reform.
   Four related amendments to the Estonian constitution also were
rejected by the Presidium, according to a report Monday in the party
newspaper Pravda.
   The amendments give Estonia power to veto Soviet laws; claim the
republic's land, natural resources and industry as the property of
the republic; give citizens the right to challenge governmental
actions in court, and legalize private property.
   Gorbachev was particularly offended by the last item. ``Private
property is the basis of exploitation of man by man,'' he said. ``It
is a deeply erroneous decision.''
   Vyalyas, who had been considered a Gorbachev ally, said on
Estonian television he and other leaders in the republic had ``fully
expected'' a negative reaction from Moscow, Feldman reported, ``but
that doesn't mean we'll accept the decrees of Moscow.''
   ``Only the Estonian parliament can change the decisions of the
Estonian parliament,'' the spokesman said. ``We have rights and
Moscow has rights, too.''
   The Communist Party's 300-member Central Committee and the
1,500-member Supreme Soviet are meeting in Moscow about Gorbachev's
constitutional changes, which Estonia and some of the 14 other
republics say shifts too much power to Moscow.
   On Sunday, the populist Estonian Popular Front said the Presidium
attempt to cancel the Estonian amendments violated the Estonian
constitution, journalist Tarmu Tammerk of the Tallinn newspaper
Kodumaa reported.
   ``It violates the republic's right to self-determination,'' a
guarantee currently enshrined in the Soviet constitution, Tammerk
explained. That section is among those up for revision at Tuesday's
meeting of the national parliament.
   Although Gorbachev has favored ending central economic control
and encouraged greater local responsibility, he denounced the
Estonian notion that the republic rather than Moscow should control
land and factories.
   ``It would preclude the possibility of conducting a single
socio-economic policy, making it impossible to distribute production
forces rationally and to create single transport systems and power
grids,'' he said.
   He expressed shock at the notion of dividing railways and turning
over huge metallurgical operations, but did hold out the possibility
of local control in such light industry as food supply, local
transport and trade, medical care, schools and restaurants.
   Gorbachev also left the door open to future negotiations with the
Estonian leadership about the problems that prompted the challenge,
declaring to the Presidium: ``We ought to see the legitimacy of the
real questions which Estonia has come to face and which demand
solution,'' he said.
   Kremlin leaders ``share the indigation'' of Estonians about the
``cavalier use of nature'' by certain Moscow ministries, he said.
Pollution by factories controlled from Moscow was one of Estonia's
complaints.

   Some of Janet Barnes' third-grade classmates
wept when they learned that she had been killed in Monday's tornado,
while others asked questions no one could answer.
   ``They asked why _ why it had to happen to Janet,'' said Debbie
Gill, a teaching assistant. ``One girl said, `She's our leader.'''
   Pupils and teachers at Lynn Road Elementary School reacted with
grief at the death of the brown-haired, 8-year-old girl who, by all
accounts, was bright, outgoing and everybody's friend.
   She was one of two children who died when tornadoes hit Raleigh
early Monday. The other was Pete Fulghum, 12, who lived about two
mies from Janet. Two other people, a married couple, died in nearby
Nash County.
   Outside Pete's demolished house, neighbors remembered how they
helped the boy's mother, Patty Fulghum, look in vain for him after
the storm went through.
   ``This is kind of a quiet neighborhood; the people aren't real
close,'' said Craig Hunter, who lives across the street. ``We don't
socialize much, but we were all helping each other out then.''
   People dug with axes and crowbars while others combed nearby
yards with flashlights. More than an hour later, a man found Pete's
body.
   ``He pulled out his hands and there was blood on them,'' Hunter
said. ``He was crying. They had a fireman take a look at (Pete), but
he was gone.''
   Mrs. Fulghum and Pete's 15-year-old sister, Ruth, were treated
for lacerations and released.
   Carolyn Earp, principal at Janet's school, said the girl was
sleeping in an upstairs room when the tornado hit, collapsing a
brick chimney on top of her and killing her instantly. Her parents
and an older sister escaped serious injury.
   ``We all feel so empty,'' said Janet's teacher, Karen Brown. ``If
all students could be like her, teaching would be so different.''
   Janet impressed her teachers by being the only third-grader to
run for a Student Council office at Lynn Elementary this year. With
the other candidates, she had to give a short speech on the school's
closed-circuit television system. She lost to a fourth-grader but
handled it well, Ms. Gill said.
   ``She was a go-getter. ... She will be terribly, terribly
missed,'' Ms. Brown said.
   The students are dealing with the trauma well, but will need help
as the shock wears off, Ms. Earp added.
   Hunter described Pete as ``a typical kid'' who liked to go
fishing and set off firecrackers. Hunter said he owns two Labrador
retrievers and that Pete would often come over to play with them.
   ``The last time I saw him was maybe a week ago,'' Hunter said.
``He and his mom had been to a movie. He had seen a black dog
running loose and he thought it was one of mine. It wasn't, but he
wanted to let me know.
   ``He was a good kid.''

<HEAD>Two Men Arrested In Extortion Letter Scheme</HEAD>

   Two men were arrested for allegedly sending
extortion letters to hundreds of residents north of Los Angeles,
threatening the recipients with death unless they paid money,
authorities said Monday.
   Roman Makuch, 27, and Richard Faroni, 26, who moved from the
Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles to Las Vegas after the
threatening letters were sent, were arrested in Las Vegas, said
Deputy Eric Smith of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
   The men were arrested during the Thanksgiving weekend and were
booked for investigation of felony extortion, said Smith.
   Detectives from the sheriff's department served several search
warrants in the Las Vegas area during the weekend, but Smith said he
had no details.
   At least 265 residents of the Antelope Valley, a desert area 60
miles north of downtown Los Angeles, began receiving the
computer-generated letters Nov. 1.
   The letters, including personal information on the recipients,
demanded amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to $600,000.
The scheme generally targeted prominent citizens such as doctors,
dentists and lawyers.
   Authorities were besieged by telephone calls from recipients in
the Mojave Desert communities of Lancaster, Palmdale and Quartz Hill.
   The Antelope Valley Press newspaper offered a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the letters'
author. City Editor Larry Grooms called the threats ``an assault on
the entire community.''
   ``They're all worded the same. The threat is all the same,'' said
sheriff's Sgt. Bob Welch, who refused to discuss details of the
threats.
   But Lancaster Mayor Els Groves said some of them included
references to ``cutting hearts out.''
   Investigators didn't believe anyone complied with demands that
money be delivered to various locations or to people named in the
letters, Welch said. They also didn't believe any attempt was made
to carry out the threats.
   Smith said the two men had lived in Antelope Valley for three
years and moved to Las Vegas after the letters were mailed. The
letters bore a Mojave postmark.
   Smith said detectives will present evidence to the Los Angeles
County district attorney's office, which will file criminal
complaints.

<HEAD>Actor's Last Words: What A Beautiful Place To Die</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Carradine, the American actor known of
his roles in horror films, whispered ``Milan, what a beautiful place
to die'' moments before succumbing to heart and kidney failure, a
son said Monday.
   The 82-year-old actor with a Mephistophelean face and a deep
voice died Sunday at a Milan hospital. He had been hospitalized
since Thursday.
   Actor David Carradine said his father was stricken Thursday,
hours after climbing the 328 steps to the top of the Duomo, Milan's
gothic cathedral.
   ``He had climbed a steep flight of stairs to reach the top of the
Duomo. He was determined to do everything he could. He had a strong
constitution but he had possibly caught a virus in South Africa
which had weakened him,'' Carradine, in tears, told The Associated
Press.
   David and his brother, fellow actor Keith Carradine, flew to
Milan from Los Angeles on Sunday after learning their father had
been hospitalized. David Carradine said his father already was in
serious condition when they arrived, but that he was happy to have
been with him during the last hours of his life.
   Doctors at Milan's Fatebenefratelli hospital said John Carradine,
who appeared in more than 500 films, died of natural causes.
   ``His kidneys, his lungs, his heart were failing. If he was
younger he could have survived,'' said David Carradine. ``The
failure of three organs all at once was a little much.''
   John Carradine had traveled to Italy to begin a European tour
after completing shooting of his latest movie _ his 502nd _ in South
Africa.
   ``He was thinking of visiting Rome, Milan, Florence, Venice,
Paris and Athens. ... He could have sat on his rocking chair but he
chose instead to embarak on an adventure. He knew the dangers and
nobody could tell him sit down and be quiet,'' David said.
   David Carradine said he was reading his father passages from
William Shakespeare, ``the author he loved most,'' when the sick man
``swallowed, turned his head a little while and died.''
   Just minutes before the actor had said: ``Milan, what a beautiful
place to die,'' according to his son.
   A family friend said the body possibly would be flown to Los
Angeles, via New York, on Wednesday.
   ``We plan a strictly private funeral service in L.A. and a public
memorial service in St. Thomas Episcopal Church ... then we will
drink, cry and dance and his ashes will be cast into the sea. All
his sons will be there,'' said David Carradine.
   He said the date of the funeral has not been set.
   David Carradine, best known for playing a half-Chinese priest in
the television show ``Kung Fu,'' is one of the acting sons of John
Carradine. The others are Robert, who arrived in Milan Monday night,
Keith and Bruce. Only Christopher Carradine, an architect, is not an
actor.
   John Carradine appeared in such classics as ``Stagecoach'' with
John Wayne and ``Grapes of Wrath'' with Henry Fonda. He also played
leads in numerous B-movies, often horror films, and portrayed Count
Dracula three times on the screen.
   His film debut came in 1930 with the talkie remake of ``Tol'able
David.''
   By 1935 his glorious, deep voice attracted the attention of John
Ford and other directors making him one of Hollywood's busiest
character actors.
   ``I never made big money in Hollywood; I was paid in hundreds,
the stars got thousands,'' he said in a 1986 interview. ``But I
worked with some of the greatest directors in film, and some of the
greatest writers. They gave me freedom to do what I can do best and
that was gratifying.''
   He always returned to Shakespeare, touring the country with his
own company.

   A former fund-raiser for Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. testified Monday it became ``increasingly clear'' that
the LaRouche movement didn't plan to repay loans made to its
organizations, but acknowledged he had been far less critical in
previous court testimony.
   Christian Curtis of Alexandria testified at LaRouche's conspiracy
trial that the three-time presidential candidate's political
movement raised money under false pretenses and did not tell those
lending it money that their loans were not likely to be repaid.
   Curtis said he left the LaRouche organization in May 1986 after
``it became increasingly clear to me there was a policy they were
not going to repay'' the loans.
   LaRouche and six associates are on trial in U.S. District Court
on charges they conspired to defraud the lenders with a scheme to
avoid repayment of their loans. LaRouche alone is charged with
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by failing to pay
taxes and not declaring as income household and personal services
provided by LaRouche-run organizations.
   Curtis told the jury that he and other LaRouche fund-raisers were
instructed to tell those who complained about non-repayment of
loans, ``We're in the midst of a war fighting for the human race. In
war there are casualties.''
   Another prosecution witness, Audrey B. Carter, testified she
loaned a LaRouche organization $20,000 and received only $500 in
interest as a repayment.
   Ms. Carter said LaRouche fundraiser Michael Billington had
promised her the loan would be repaid in a year at 10 percent
interest. Billington told her, she testified, that her money was
``as safe as in the bank.''
   Curtis also said LaRouche organizers concocted a fund-raising
scheme in which potential givers were falsely told their money was
needed to publish a LaRouche anti-drug book because Latin American
leaders urged that the publication be rushed into print.
   But under cross-examination, defense attorney William Moffitt
showed Curtis statements he had made to federal and state law
enforcement officers and in testimony at a LaRouche trial in Boston
earlier this year.
   Curtis was forced to acknowledge repeatedly his earlier
statements that LaRouche operatives acted in ``good faith'' to repay
the loans but were unable to do so because the movement was engaged
in ``financial warfare.''
   The latter statement backs the contention of LaRouche and his
co-defendants that they intended to repay some $30 milliion in loans
but were unable to do so when they had to divert money to defend
themselves against harassment by the government and news media.
   Curtis also acknowledged to jurors that he testified in the
earlier trial that he did not believe the non-repayment was the
result of a scam but stemmed from the ``irresponsibility and
negligence'' of LaRouche staffers.
   ``You swore to tell the truth'' at the Boston trial, Moffitt
asked.
   ``I did,'' Curtis said.
   Under friendlier questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Markham, Curtis said chief LaRouche fund-raiser William Wertz, a
defendant in the case, established quotas for his subordinates.
   When quotas were not met, Curtis said, Wertz accused the staffers
of being ``impotent,'' with ``lacking killer instinct'' and being
``not sufficiently ruthless.''
   Asked by Markham to describe the reaction of LaRouche staffers to
such tirades, Curtis said: ``I saw a number of people break down and
cry. Some became hysterical over the telephone and started shouting
at contacts, calling them names. I saw organizers become visibly
distraught and become depressed.''
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of
credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.
Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years
in prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.
   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail
fraud and conspiracy charges.
   In the tax conspiracy count, the federal grand jury charged that
LaRouche has not filed a federal income tax return since at least
1979.

<TEXT>
   The ruling National Liberation Front
re-elected President Chadli Bendjedid as party chief Monday night
and a chose a new Central Committee to help him achieve political
reform.
   As secretary-general of Algeria's only party, Bendjedid becomes
the sole candidate in a presidential election the party congress set
for Dec. 22. The election, in which he seeks his third five-year
term, originally was to have been held in February.
   The new 155-member Central Committee's membership is roughly
one-third each from local chapters; government and party officials,
and associations and professional groups. Party professionals and
the army dominated the outgoing Central Committee.
   ``I need your help because the mission is difficult, the task is
long and the problems are great,'' Bendjedid, 59, told the 5,078
delegates as the sixth party congress ended.
   ``The renewal of your confidence is a support for the political
reform proposals, of which a part have already been applied and
others are going to be. I promise to do my best to implement your
political program.''
   Bendjedid's opening speech Sunday at the two-day congress was
less forceful than expected. Sources at the meeting said privately
he appeared to want a compromise with those in the army and party
apparatus who opposed his reform plans.
   Part of that compromise apparently involved postponing a
multiparty system in Algeria.
   For two years, Bendjedid has been trying to loosen the grip of
the National Liberation Front on day-to-day government operations.
The front, originally the military organization that won Algeria's
independence from France in 1962, later became the sole legal
political party.
   Momentum for change was increased by a week of riots in October
in which 176 were killed by official count and hundreds wounded.
There were numerous reports of torture by police.
   The first series of reforms, mostly changes to the constitution,
were approved in a nationwide referendum Nov. 3. Among the changes
were wider powers accorded the premier and making the premier
directly responsible to parliament instead of the president.
   In his opening speech, Bendjedid said a a multiparty state could
come at at a later date if all agreed on the need for it. A
multiparty system now, he said, represented a threat to the unity of
the nation.
   The foreign press has been barred from directly covering the
congress and denied access to the conference hall, although Algerian
news organizations are covering the event.
   Abdelhamid Mehri, the No. 2 man in the party, said at a news
conference the subject of introducing a multiparty system was not
raised before the 5,078 delegates to the congress.
   Instead, Bendjedid has focused on bringing new blood into the
existing party, noting that many ``honest and patriotic'' people
have not joined, Mehri said.
   ``The National Liberation Front is not going to withdraw from
political life,'' Mehri said. ``It will continue as a political
force that will be active at all levels.''
   He said the first step was to open a wider dialogue involving as
many people and groups as possible.
   ``For now, we can't talk about parties or associations because
now they don't exist,'' he said.
   He said that under the reforms to be proposed to parliament,
independent candidacies outside the party framework would be allowed
in elections for local and national assemblies.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc asked Labor on Monday to join a new coalition government,
offering the rival party two of the four most powerful Cabinet posts.
   Shamir met with the center-left party's leaders, Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It was the first
meeting since the Nov. 1 election between Shamir and Peres, who have
been in a tenuous ``national unity'' coalition since indecisive 1984
elections.
   Likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats Nov. 1 and Labor got 39.
The rest went to small parties, 18 of them to ultra-Orthodox
religious parties that could be kingmakers in a right-wing coalition.
   Neither Likud nor Labor ministers would reveal details of the
Monday's discussion. Peres said Labor would respond to the offer
later this week.
   ``We decided to bring the proposals, without any recommendation _
there is no need _ to the (party) bureau ... the body authorized to
decide, based on the offers we got, whether to go to negotiations or
not,'' Peres said after briefing Labor ministers.
   The government under discussion would be similar to the
4-year-old coalition, but Shamir would be prime minister all four
years rather than switching jobs with Peres at mid-tern, as happened
in 1986.
   Labor broke off coalition talks with Likud last week, calling its
offer of one senior Cabinet post insufficient. The prime ministry,
foreign, defense and finance are considered senior posts.
   Shamir subsequently offered Peres the Foreign Ministry, Israel
radio said, despite his opposition to his rival's proposal for an
international Middle East peace conference and differences on terms
of peace with the Arabs.
   Likud already agreed to offer Labor the Defense Ministry, so
Labor would have two senior posts and Likud would control the prime
minister's office and the Finance Ministry.
   The radio said that Likud, overall, insists on having Likud
ministers outnumber Labor ministers by at least one on the full
Cabinet.
   The latest offer from Likud comes after Shamir's efforts to
construct a coalition with small religious and right-wing parties
stalled, following squabbles over Cabinet posts and demands for
religious legislation that has split Jews worldwide.
   The religious parties were demanding a new immigration law that
would deny immediate Israeli citizenship to Jews converted by Reform
or Conservative rabbis, reserving citizenship only for Orthodox
converts.
   The Likud ministers made no decision in Monday's meeting about
what foreign policy a Likud-Labor government might formulate. The
issue is likely to be a major stumbling block in negotiations.
   Israeli news reports said Likud would insist that Peres be barred
from openly advocating an international Middle East peace conference.
   In the election campaign, Peres called for trading land for peace
and launching negotiations under the umbrella of an international
conference. Shamir rejected territorial compromise and called for
direct talks aimed at granting the Palestinians limited autonomy.

   President-elect George Bush, responding to a
best-wishes telegram from Democratic keynote speaker Ann Richards,
sent her a handwritten ``peace offering'' and a tiny silver pin
shaped like a foot.
   Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, declared in her keynote speech
at the Democratic National Convention that Republican Bush had been
``born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   After Bush's election on Nov. 8, however, Ms. Richards wished him
``the very best'' in his new administratrion.
   Bush wrote her a note dated Nov. 21, saying, ``You've probably
received a hundred of these `feet' but I want you to have this one
from me _ a peace offering; and as our daughter said, `It's real' _
just ask the Hunt Brothers.''
   ``Really, that was a nice telegram. Many thanks, George.''
   Ms. Richards said Monday: ``I think it was a kind and generous
gesture on his part. I was delighted that he saw and enjoyed the
humor in the keynote address.''
   The Hunt brothers from Dallas, three sons of the late oil
billionaire H.L. Hunt, were found by a federal jury to have engaged
in a scheme to corner the market on silver in the late 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of
West Germany urged Iranian leaders on Monday to help win the release
of all foreign hostages held in Lebanon, said an official
accompanying Genscher.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Iranians showed ``great readiness'' to discuss the matter in detail
in future talks with Genscher.
   Genscher, who arrived in Tehran on Sunday, met for four hours
Monday with Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and held separate
discussions with President Ali Khamenei and Velayati's deputy,
Mohammed Yavad Lariyani.
   He stressed in his talks that freeing the hostages is a
``humanitarian question that is independent of nationalities'' and
he ``urged the Iranians to continue their efforts toward ... (their)
release,'' said the official.
   Fourteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are believed held
by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon. Longest held is
Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   In addition Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss employee of the Red Cross,
was abducted by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17 in Sidon, 25 miles
south of Beirut. No group has claimed responsibility for the
kidnapping.
   Genscher is scheduled to meet with Velayati on Tuesday and is
expected to raise the hostages issue again. The West German is also
to hold talks Tuesday with Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and
Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   ``The issue of the hostages remains of the utmost concern to
us,'' said the West German source. ``We are ready to do whatever we
can to speed their release.''
   Velayati and Genscher discussed ``mutual political, economic and
cultural ties as well as international cooperation and regional
issues,'' according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia.
   Velayati told Genscher that Bonn-Tehran relations were
``consolidating daily ... on a basis of mutual respect,'' the report
said.
   The agency made no mention of the hostage issue.
   Velayati said West Germany, which has strong trade links with
Iran, could play a major role in the reconstruction following the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, the agency reported. A cease-fire went
into effect Aug. 20.
   Iran imports more goods from West Germany than from any other
country, according to the Bonn Economics Ministry.
   Genscher was accompanied by a 30-member delegation, including
West German industrial leaders.
   Genscher's diplomacy and his good contacts with Tehran throughout
the Persian Gulf war were seen as key factors in the release of two
West German hostages who had been held in Lebanon.
   In his meeting with Velayati, Genscher also ``stressed (West
Germany's concern) over the human rights situation in Iran,'' said
the West German source.
   He was referring to reports by Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights organization, of human rights violations
in Iran, the source said.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Extradition of Accused War Criminal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered the
extradition to West Germany of former Nazi SS Capt. Josef
Schwammberger, who is accused of killing at least 5,000 people, most
of them Jews, at forced labor camps.
   Schwammberger's lawyers said they would appeal Monday's ruling on
grounds his responsibility was limited because he was obeying orders
from superiors.
   Schwammberger, 76, commanded labor camps in occupied Poland
during World War II. He was arrested Nov. 13, 1987, in Huerta
Grande, a village 500 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, and has been
jailed since in this city 31 miles south of the capital.
   At a deportation hearing in July, three survivors of the Przemysl
and Mielec labor camps testified that Schwammberger personally shot
Jews, starved prisoners and set dogs on them.
   ``He was a sadist, an evil person,'' Edward Blonder of Miami
testified.
   At the time of his arrest, Schwammberger was among the
most-wanted Nazis on a list compiled by the Wiesenthal Center of
Vienna, Austria.
   ``We believe that the judge ruled correctly. We think the chances
of winning an appeal are remote,'' Rabbi Marvin Hier, director of
the Los Angeles branch of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust
Studies, said in a telephone interview.
   West Germany requested Schwammberger's extradition. Acourt in
Stuttgart issued an order for his arrest in 1973.
   ``We already have been asked by the government of West Germany to
find witnesses for his trial there,'' Hier said.
   ``It's usually difficult to find witnesses so many years after
the crime. To have so many witnesses that personally saw him commit
the crime of murder is an indication of the magnitude of his
crimes.''
   Many top Nazis fled to South America when it became clear that
Germany's defeat was in inevitable.
   Adolf Eichmann, architect of the ``final solution'' in which Jews
were rounded up and executed, was kidnapped in Buenos Aires in 1960
by Israeli agents, convicted at a trial in Jerusalem and hanged.
   Argentine police currently have been asked to find Abraham Kipp,
a former citizen of Holland sentenced to death for crimes committed
during World War II.
   Last month, A Dutch parliamentarian urged the arrest and
extradition of Kipp, who in 1949 was convicted for his part in the
arrests of dozens of Dutch Jews by German police during the Nazi
occupation in 1940-1945.
   Kipp became a naturalized Argentine in 1953. Schwammberger
arrived in Argentina in 1949 and obtained citizenship in 1965.
   Schwammberger lived in La Plata and worked for a chemical company
for many years, officials said.

<HEAD>Trade Battle Looms over Hormones in Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the European Economic Community
have decided against having talks in Washington this week to explore
prospects for averting a trade battle over the EEC's scheduled Jan.
1 ban of meat from animals treated with growth hormones.
   ``They just saw the Americans the weekend before last and they'll
see them again in another week,'' said Ella Krucoff, speaking for
the community's delegation in Washington.
   U.S. producers stand to lose meat sales which totaled about $169
million last year in the 12 EEC nations, and administration
officials say President-elect George Bush could retaliate with
restrictions against the sale of European meat products, or even
some industrial products, in the United States.
   Patricia F. Stolfa of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service said the value of the European meat exports
to the United States is higher, because they include high quality
items like Danish ham. The U.S. market in Europe, on the other hand,
includes a large quantity of cheaper cuts such as hearts and
kidneys, she said.
   The use of hormones to speed animal growth is forbidden in the
EEC's member nations, which include West Germany, Britain, Italy,
Holland, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Spain, Portugal and Greece.
   However, there have been widespread reports of illegal use of
hormones by European producers and Ms. Stolfa suggested it could be
appropriate to delay the import ban while the European Parliament
completes an investigation already in progress.
   Earlier Monday, U.S. officials said imminent talks were possible
in Washington, and the EEC would be represented by Willy De Clercq,
a Belgian in charge of external affairs for the European Commission,
and Frans Andriessen, a Netherlander and top agricultural official.
   But they apparently decided to wait for a meeting in Montreal,
beginning Dec. 5, when U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng are due to review trade issues
with representatives of nearly 100 nations.
   Lester M. Crawford of the Food Safety and Inspection Service said
the hormones used on U.S. cattle do not leave residues that are
harmful to humans. He said scientists in Europe have supported the
U.S. position.
   The Reagan administration has proposed that international
decisions on the safety of hormones be entrusted to the Codex
Alimentarius Commission, a United Nations body with 129 governments
as members.

   A Soyuz TM-7 spacecraft carrying a joint
Soviet-French team docked Monday with the Mir orbiting space
station, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The capsule, which will remained docked almost a month, was
manned by Soviet cosmonauts Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev and
Frenchman Jean-Loup Chretien. Tass said the Soyuz capsule was fitted
with a new guidance system that simplified rendezvous and docking
and cut down on fuel consumption.
   It said the three men entered Mir after checking air locks and
that they and the three cosmonauts already aboard Mir all were
feeling well.
   Volkov, Krikalev and Chretien blasted off from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia on Saturday, with French President
Francois Mitterrand on hand to watch.
   Tass said the Soyuz's engines were fired in the 32nd and 33rd
orbit Monday, bringing it 25 miles closer to the space station, and
then an automatic guidance system brought the capsule to within 400
yards of the space station.
   At that point, the Soyuz started circling until it reached a
distance of 150 yards, and mission control gave the order for its
crew to move in and dock.
   Tass said the Soyuz is attached to the Kvant orbiting laboratory,
which docked with the space station last March.
   Chretien is to return to Earth on Dec. 21 with cosmonauts Musa
Manarov and Vladimir Titov, who will be completing a full year in
orbit. Earlier this month they broke the space endurance record set
by cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko in 1987.
   Volkov and Krikalev will replace Manarov and Titov.
   Chretien is to make a space walk to install some equipment and
conduct tests during his month in space.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Space Flight Reduces Growth Hormone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID S. MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American scientist who tested rats
flown aboard an unmanned Soviet spacecraft said Monday he found
lower levels of a hormone affecting the rodents' bone and muscle
mass.
   Wesley C. Hymer, director of the NASA-funded Center for Cell
Research, said learning why growth hormone levels were reduced in
the rats could have implications on lengthy space missions and
osteoporosis research.
   Astronauts have experienced bone and muscle losses during space
flight, a possible hindrance to lengthy missions such as a manned
space station or journey to Mars.
   ``One could think about using space as a research laboratory for
studying osteoporosis,'' said Hymer, a 53-year-old biochemistry
professor at Penn State University who has worked with NASA since
1978.
   ``The changes that one sees in space with regard to loss of bone
mass and mineral density not only parallel and mimic what you find
here on Earth, but they happen quicker,'' he said.
   Some 24 million Americans, most of them elderly, suffer from
osteoporosis, a loss of bone tissue that results in brittle bones,
according to the Washington-based National Osteoporosis Foundation.
   Hymer's tests on cells from five rats aboard a 12{-day flight on
the Soviet Cosmos Biosatellite flight last October duplicated
results of an earlier experiment he conducted on 24 rats aboard a
U.S. space shuttle mission in 1985. Both experiments showed the
release of growth hormone reduced by about half in rats who were in
weightless conditions.
   ``The next step is to find out why,'' Hymer said.
   Next summer, Hymer plans to test cells of five more rats flown
aboard a Soviet biosatellite to see how they respond to a chemical
from the brain that causes growth hormone to be released from the
pituitary gland.
   Hymer also has received permission to conduct further research
about a future shuttle mission.
   In that experiment, expected to find a space shuttle berth
sometime in the next two years, Hymer plans to send growth hormone
producing cells from the pituitary gland into space to see how they
respond to weightlessness.
   Hymer's research was one of 27 American projects aboard the
Cosmos flight last year. He collaborated with three Soviet
researchers, who were to release the findings this week in Moscow.
   ``Man has been in space for over 30 years. We know that there are
changes that occur. We certainly don't know about the mechanisms
that are involved,'' said Hymer.
   ``We need desperately to do more research in the space
environment,'' he added.
   Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman, said that in the absence of
American missions, the availability of Cosmos flights has kept U.S.
life sciences research going in space.
   Americans have been able to conduct experiments aboard six Soviet
biosatellite missions under an agreement first signed during the
Nixon administration.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had
room for any life sciences research since the Challenger Spacelab 3
in 1985. A Space Life Sciences mission is scheduled for 1991,
Redmond said.
   NASA also has planned to launch biannual Lifesat flights similar
to the Cosmos missions beginning in late 1990 or 1991, Redmond said.
   Soviet scientists would be invited to participate in research
conducted aboard those flights, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will have to request a
2 percent real increase in defense spending next year unless it
wants to reduce military strength overseas and cut aircraft carrier
deployments, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Monday.
   ``At 2 percent real growth, our current defense budget is
executeable,'' Carlucci said in response to a question after
delivering a speech marking NATO's 40th birthday.
   ``Now, obviously, if you go from 2 percent real growth to zero
real growth (just matching inflation), you've got a problem, and
over a five-year period, that problem is about $116 billion in
programs,'' he continued.
   ``I think our force structure is about as low as you can sensibly
get it and still execute our military strategy around the world. If
additional force structure cuts are required, you're going to have
to look at such things as deployable carrier battle groups and some
force structure overseas.''
   The only alternative to cuts in strength would be ``the
unfortunate way that we did it in the 1970s, which is in effect to
hollow out our forces _ shortchange them in ammunition, readiness,
let the quality of our people erode _ and I hope we would avoid
that.''
   Carlucci spoke at a conference sponsored by the Institute of
Foreign Policy Analysis, lauding the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's success over the past 40 years in maintaining the
peace and offering his prescription for the future.
   As he has done previously, Carlucci said the alliance had to
maintain ``a firm sense of realism'' about the Soviet Union's
intentions, judging Russia's actions and not the promises of
glasnost.
   He also said all the members of the alliance needed to increase
their monetary and political support for defense and continue to
modernize their weapons systems.
   The U.S. government should not ask for greater European spending
with an eye toward reducing its own contributions to NATO, ``but as
a way of nurturing defense cooperation,'' Carlucci said.
   Carlucci, who has made it clear he expects to step down from his
post when Vice President George Bush is inaugurated as president on
Jan. 20, said he was proceeding with plans to submit a fiscal 1990
Pentagon budget request in January that would include money to
increase spending by 2 percent after inflation.
   The fiscal 1989 budget totals about $300 billion. Bush will be
free to accept or modify the fiscal 1990 proposal before Congress
considers it.
   ``My position is that we ought to continue to argue for the 2
percent real increase,'' Carlucci said.
   ``Domestic programs continue to rise at a rate of about 8
percent. I see nothing wrong with 2 percent real growth in our
defense budget, particularly coming on the heels of a 12 percent
total cut over the past four years.''
   At the same conference, Brent Scowcroft, named by Bush to be the
national security adviser in the next administration, said there are
``a lot of problems'' that the United States and NATO nations face
in the future.
   The two sides will have to work out ways to share the burden of
defense and keep their ``collective wits'' about them in regard to
the Soviets, he said.

   Two officers wearing bulletproof vests were disarmed
and fatally shot in the head Monday as they struggled with a man
released from prison 10 days ago, police said.
   The man, who had served eight years in prison for attempted
murder, fled in one of the officers' patrol cars and stole another
car at gunpoint before he was arrested in neighboring Broward
County, police said.
   One Metro-Dade police officer died at a hospital shortly after
the early-morning shooting; the second was pronounced dead about
noon.
   ``Both of the officers had head wounds, very serious head wounds,
as well as to the arms and shoulders and about the tops of their
bodies,'' said Fred Taylor, director of the Metro-Dade police
department.
   The officers, Richard Boles, 41, and David Strzalkowski, 34, were
shot a total of seven times, apparently with their own weapons,
Taylor said.
   Two counts of first-degree murder were expected to be filed
against Charles Harry Street, 34, of Boynton Beach, said Metro-Dade
Sgt. Russell Fischer.
   Police said Street had called an ambulance after reportedly
suffering stomach pains. He then declined to go to the hospital, and
emergency medical technicians and police left the scene.
   About an hour later, Boles and Strzalkowski were dispatched when
Street was spotted throwing rocks at homes in a nearby trailer park
and at passing cars. He eventually picked up what appeared to be a
pipe and residents chased him out of the trailer park, police said.
   ``We think they were charged by someone with a pipe, and then he
got rid of the pipe and they had to fight by hand, and that's when
they lost the guns,'' Taylor said.
   After the shooting, police charged, Street sped away in a patrol
car, abandoned it in the neighboring Broward County community of
Hollywood and stole a car there from a woman at gunpoint.
   Broward deputies were alerted by radio, and two officers on
patrol saw the man in the street about an hour later, said Broward
sheriff's spokesman George Crolius.
   ``They approached to try to find out what was going on, and at
that point the suspect dropped the gun and said to the deputy,
`Don't shoot me,''' Crolius said.
   Street was taken to jail and later transferred to Metro-Dade
police custody.
   Street had served eight years of a 15-year sentence for an
attempted murder in Palm Beach County, said Fischer, who did not
have additional details of the conviction. Fischer also said Street
has a police record over 20 pages long dating from 1972, including
assaults and other violent crimes.

<HEAD>U.N. Lawyer Says Washington Has No Right To Bar Arafat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.N. lawyer said Monday the United
States has no legal basis for denying a visa to PLO chief Yasser
Arafat, who sought to come to New York to address the General
Assembly on Palestine.
   U.N. lawyer Carl-August Fleischhauer said the State Department
was relying on a paragraph Congress added to the 1947 Headquarters
Agreement, in which America agreed to be the host country for the
world body.
   Section 11 of the agreement says local, state and U.S.
authorities must not impede the travel of U.N. diplomats or
``representatives of non-governmental organizations recognized by
the Unied Nations for the purpose of consultation.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has non-voting observer
status at the world body and represents the interests of
Palestinians in all debate on the Middle East.
   ``The Headquarters Agreement makes it clear that there is an
unrestricted right of the persons mentioned in Section 11 to enter
the U.S. for the purpose of proceeding to the headquarters,''
Fleischhauer said.
   On Saturday, the State Department said the agreement obligates
the United States to provide entry, transit and residence to guests
of the United Nations.
   It relied on the U.S. Congress' additional paragraph in denying a
visa to Arafat, who the State Department said ``knows of, condones
and lends support to'' acts of terrorism it claimed were perpetrated
by the PLO.
   Congress added the paragraph in 1947 upon U.S. ratification,
after the State Department and the United Nations signed the treaty
in 1946.
   The clause in U.S. law, however, seems aimed at restricting the
movements of aliens regarded as security risks and does not appear
to apply to a brief visit by an invited guest of the United Nations.
   It specifically exempts U.N. Headquarters, the immediate
neighborhood and travel to and from the headquarters from
interference by U.S. authorities on the basis of national security.
   The key wording of the clause, which is in the U.S. law but not
in the Headquarters Agreement, reads:
   ``Nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way
diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the United States
to safeguard its own security and completely to control the entrance
of aliens into any territory of the United States other than the
headquarters district and its immediate vicinity ... and such areas
as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in transit between the
same and foreign countries.''
   The State Department, on Saturday, merely cited its interest
under U.S. law in barring aliens invited by the United Nations ``in
order to safeguard its own security.''
   It did not quote the passages that specifically exempt brief
visits by leaders such as Arafat.
   Particia M. Byrne, the third-ranking ambassador at the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations, said the United States disagreed with
Fleischhauer's assessment but offered no evidence to support the
American position.

   Carrie Ward hopes the wheeling and
dealing on Wall Street will lure her 11-year-old son away from the
deadlier dealing on crack street.
   He was one of 31 children ages 10 to 15 who attended a one-day
class Saturday, learning about the financial rise of the fictitious
Puppy Ice Cream Co. and hearing about the stock market, bonds and
financial journals.
   The Dollars & Sense program _ in the group's logo, the ampersand
resembles a cents sign _ was brought here as part of the Riviera
Beach Police Department's drug abuse resistance education, or DARE,
program.
   The police department in this predominantly low-income city
thinks it's a small step toward snagging kids away from the
attraction of making easy money _ or spending hard-earned money _ on
crack and marijuana.
   ``They're going to realize that there are other ways to make
money beside drugs,'' said Ms. Ward, a deputy clerk for the city.
   On his way to school, she said, her son can watch drug dealers
flashing wads of money and driving fancy cars. But this Saturday, he
saw something else.
   Until now, the 3-year-old Dollars & Sense program has been aimed
at wealthier families and was held mainly at resorts and hotels.
Saturday's class, however, came to the low- and middle-income
students of predominantly black Riviera Beach.
   ``This was a chance to see what the rich children see, and learn
what the rich children learn,'' Ms. Ward said.
   ``I pray to God it works.''
   Jamie Brown, 13, said she wants to go to college and become a
defense attorney. After learning a little bit of money management,
she said what money she receives for Christmas is going into a
savings account for college.
   ``I learned most of all that money doesn't grow on trees,'' Jamie
said. ``I know I'm going to spend my money more carefully.''
   And that's just the attitude Riviera Beach juvenile officer
Sharon Vereen-Thomas hopes the kids took home from their seven-hour
lesson.
   ``We want to get the children to invest in their future,'' she
said. ``Come Christmastime, their parents are really going to be
shocked.''

   Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali
was hospitalized in extremely critical condition Monday with heart
and lung problems, doctors said.
   The 84-year-old artist was suffering from a weakened heart
aggravated by blood clots in his lungs, said a statement issued by a
five-doctor team at the Quiron Clinic in Barcelona.
   Dali became ill on Sunday and was taken to a hospital in his
hometown of Figueras, 60 miles north of Barcelona. He was
transferred to the Quiron Clinic on Monday.
   The transfer became necessary because of the painter's worsened
condition and the need for more sophisticated medical facilities,
Javier Lopez Schmid, a clinic spokesman, said on Spanish national
television.
   Dali has lived in the Galatea Tower attached to his Dali
Theater-Museum in Figueras since he left a hospital in September
1984 after recovering from burns suffered in an electrical fire.
   Figueras Mayor Mariano Lorca, a member of the board of the Dali
Foundation, told Spanish National Radio the painter's condition was
``very worrisome.''
   Dali, one of the founders of the surrealist movement, is the last
member of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that
included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a
decade late, and has lived in seclusion since the death of his wife
Gala in 1982.
   Since the 1984 fire, Dali has been confined to a wheelchair and
his fed through a tube in his nose.
   He entered the Quiron Clinic in July 1986 to have a pacemaker
installed following a mild heart attack.

<TEXT>
   About 300 women's rights activists from
throughout the world protested outside Premier Yitzhak Shamir's
office on Monday as he met with backers of a proposal to tighten
qualifications for being an Israeli Jew.
   Shamir also met separately Monday with American Jewish leaders,
who are upset that the proposal could alienate many U.S. Jews who
now strongly support Israel.
   Bella Abzug and Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman,
both New York Democrats and both former congresswomen, were among
those protesting while Shamir met with the leaders of the
ultra-Orthodox political parties, who are pushing for the stricter
Israeli immigration law.
   The proposed law would outlaw non-Orthodox conversions to Judaism
in Israel and has outraged many American Jews, most of whom belong
to the faith's Reform and Convervative movements. The ultra-Orthodox
parties have demanded the change as a price for joining a coaltion
government with Shamir's Likud bloc.
   Likud moved to reopen talks toward forming a government with the
rival, left-leaning Labor Party on Monday. Likud officials insisted
they will keep their promises to small religious parties to amend
the law.
   Shamir met Monday with the ultra-Orthodox Torah Flag, Torah
Guardians and National Religious parties. No details on the meeting
emerged.
   Outside his office, feminist protesters from more than 20 nations
waved signs, listened to speeches and chanted, ``Women say, don't
change the law!''
   ``This has no business on the political agenda,'' said Abzug.
``This has no business when you have an important crisis in the
country and you're trying to put together a coalition.''
   Abzug was referring to the nearly yearlong Palestinian uprising
in the Israeli-occupied territories and the efforts of Likud, which
narrowly won the most seats in Parliament in the Nov. 1 election, to
forge a coalition government.
   Holtzman argued against the Israeli government's view that a
change in the law is an internal matter.
   ``Israel has asked me many times in the United States to act in
the Congress to provide money, to speak out on behalf of Israel,''
she said.
   ``They want all of us to come here, and yet, on the other hand,
they thumb their noses now with this proposed amendment.''
   Abzug and Holtzman were in the country as part of a four-day
International Jewish Feminist Conference.
   Leaders of the B'nai B'rith met with Shamir shortly after the
protest to voice their concern.
   ``Israel is the centrality of our religion, whether we are
Reform, Conservative or Orthodox and we want to keep that feeling
alive,'' said Seymour Reich, president of B'nai B'rith
International. ``If the law changes the feeling might be
diminished.''
   Reich said B'nai B'rith's 500,000 members in 41 countries were
united in their opposition to the amendment. He said the American
Jewish community is likely to reduce its finiancial contributions to
Israel if the law is passed.
   Morris Abram, president of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations said: ``I don't believe that those who
proposed a change in the law recognize the depth of feeling felt by
many non-Orthodox Jews toward this law which they feel excludes
them.''

<HEAD>Army Trucks Ordered To Help Commuters Hit By French Tranist Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist government is ordering out army trucks
to carry suburban commuters stranded by a transit strike, Transport
Minister Michel Delebarre announced on national television Monday.
   Delebarre accused the Communist-led General Confederation of
Labor (CGT), France's largest union and the one which called the
strike, of waging ``a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment.
This is not in the French union tradition.''
   He said that besides paralyzing two lines of the regional express
rail network on Monday, striking transit workers blocked buses in
their terminals and flattened tires and sabotaged engines.
   He said management of the Paris regional transit agency will be
directed to stop paying strikers' salaries and to start disciplinary
actions against those who broke labor laws.
   More moderate unions have criticized CGT strike leadership, but
some members of other unions and non-union members are taking part
in the walkout.
   Transport Ministry officials said it will be Wednesday morning
before the first 140 army trucks were available, with eventually 400
vehicles and 1,000 soldiers to be put at the disposition of local
authorities to assure transport.
   The government of Premier Michel Rocard has been unsettled by a
wave of strikes by nurses, postal employees, government office
workers and other public service employees in recent months. But
Rocard insists that inflationary wage increases cannot be allowed.
   Socialist Party spokesman Jean-Jacques Queyranne said he wondered
``if the CGT really wants negotiations to succeed and does it want
the disruption to increase and the conflict to continue?''
   CGT Secretary-General Henri Krasucki dismissed as ``completely
stupid'' suggestions that the strikes were intended to increase
Communist chances at the expense of the Socialists in next spring's
municipal elections.
   Delebarre asked, ``Why would taking hundreds of thousands of
riders hostage, which is what has happened, lead these riders to
vote in the municipal elections for those who incited this kind of
union guerrilla warfare?''
   CGT members have said they want safety improvements and
across-the-board pay increases of $170 per month.
   Besides stopping two of the four lines of the Regional Express
Network, the strike also affected some Metro service, with between
67 and 85 percent of the normal number of trains running on five
lines.
   Michel Rousselot, director general of the transit agency, said on
French TV no new negotiations were planned with the unions
representing the workers.
   The CGT-led strike was to last at least through Tuesday.

as far south as Mississippi and Georgia, and snow to many parts of
the West and Northeast.
   Winds gusted to 78 mph near the summit between Cheyenne and
Laramie, Wyo., and high wind warnings and watches continued in parts
of Wyoming and Colorado. Snowfall in northwestern Wyoming, which had
begun Sunday, tapered off but accumulations of up to 8 inches were
seen.
   By noon, snow extended from Michigan across western New York
state, from western Pennsylvania across Indiana, and in West
Virginia, eastern Kentucky and northwestern North Carolina. Snow
also extended over Idaho and Nevada, and was scattered across
Wyoming.
   Rain stretched along most of the East Coast from New England to
Virginia. Snowfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included 3
inches at Burley, Idaho, 2 inches at Idaho Falls, Idaho, and South
Bend, Ind., and an inch at Pocatello, Idaho. Heavier rainfall during
the same six hours included about one-half inch at Rocky Mount,
N.C., and Fort Eustis, Va.
   By Tuesday, the National Weather Service said, temperatures were
expected to be 10 to 20 degrees colder than Monday from Maine to
North Carolina, and the chill was reaching well into the Deep South.
   Frost and freeze warnings were posted for overnight in South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, except for the coastal
regions of those states.
   Early Monday, a rash of tornadoes touched down in North Carolina
and one was reported in Virginia. There were four people reported
killed in and near Raleigh, N.C., and about 150 people injured and
extensive damage across North Carolina. Some property damage but no
injuries were reported in Virginia.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 87 degrees at West Palm Beach, Fla.
The low temperature for the nation Monday morning was 13 degrees
below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   The national forecast for Tuesday called for snow extending from
western Upper Michigan and Wisconsin across the northeastern third
of Iowa and the western two-thirds of Minnesota; and strong, gusty
winds in the foothills and eastern slopes of Colorado.
   Highs in the 20s were forecast in northern Maine, Upper Michigan
and the northern half of Minnesota; in the 30s and 40s from central
Maine to the Virginias, the remainder of the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley, most of the upper Mississippi Valley, most of the Plains,
the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies, to the northern half of the
Pacific Coast; in the 70s in southern parts of Florida, Texas,
California and Arizona; and in the 50s and 60s in most of the rest
of the nation.

<HEAD>Police Storm Hillside Slum for Drugs, Killing Eight</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) About 50 heavily armed state and
local police stormed a hillside Rio shantytown in daylong drug raids
on Monday, killing eight people and arresting five, officials said.
   Police burst into wood and brick huts in the Providence hillside
community, looking for drug runners and petty criminals, and
exchanged intense gunfire with traffickers hiding in the community
of about 3,000, according to federal police spokesman Geovanni
Azevedo.
   Azevedo said six drug runners, all under 25 years old, were
cornered and shot to death in a school, which was closed at the
time, and two others were killed by gunfire in a nearby cemetery.
   The action was part of a new local government policy of clearing
out drug runners from outlying and hillside slums. The Rio
shantytowns have become home to criminals, who set their own law
there and protect dwellers from routine crime. Critics accused
police of allowing drug runners to set deep roots in the Rio slums
and also of cooperating with organized crime in some cases.

   A federal grand jury investigating PTL
founder Jim Bakker and several of his former aides reconvened Monday
amid speculation that indictments could be returned as early as the
end of the week.
   ``It's anybody's guess,'' said Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms of
Hendersonville. ``All we can do right now is sit around and wait.
   ``I would think they're not quite to that (indictments) but
they're not far from it,'' he said. ``They're still taking
testimony. I guess we could all be surprised. We're certainly
getting closer.''
   Toms said earlier that he believes Bakker will be indicted.
   ``It's a question of when,'' he said, ``and what the particular
allegations will be.''
   The 23-member grand jury went back to work Monday morning,
hearing testimony from a number of PTL ``lifetime partners,'' people
who contributed money to the ministry in exchange for hotel lodging
at Heritage USA, the Christian theme park run by PTL.
   Bakker, who resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after the
revelation that he had a tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn
and paid her hush money, has denied any criminal wrongdoing. He has
called the grand jury investigation ``a fishing expedition.''
   Three months ago he predicted: ``I don't think I'll be indicted.
I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.''
   Charles Alexander, the federal prosecutor handling the
16-month-old investigation, wrote Bakker and at least two of his
former associates last month informing them that they were targets
of the probe and inviting them to appear before the grand jury this
week.
   Bakker declined the invitation, but one of the others, Roe
Messner, who was PTL's chief builder under Bakker, indicated last
week he might testify before the grand jury.
   As of late Monday, however, Messner had not shown up at the
federal courthouse in downtown Charlotte, where the special panel is
conducting its investigation behind closed doors.
   Toms said the timing of the indictments depends on whether
Messner agrees to testify or not.
   ``My feeling is that if he does (testify) it would eat up a good
deal of time,'' he said. ``At this point, I have not heard that he
is not (going to appear).''
   Toms said he has had several telephone conversations with
Alexander, and his expectation that Bakker will be indicted is
``just my impression based on my experience and the conversations. I
think that's consistent with the kind of talk he's (Alexander) given
me.''
   Toms speculated the indictments would be returned the week of
Dec. 12, but he did not dismiss the possibility that they could come
as early as this week.
   Bakker has been preaching at his new church, New Covenant Church,
in Charlotte.

<TEXT>
   ``Scrooged,'' the retelling of the Charles
Dickens Christmas classic starring comedian Bill Murray, opened to
huge box-office business in the first big week of holiday movie
going.
   According to preliminary figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co., ``Scrooged'' collected $13 million during the
weekend, easily topping second-place finisher ``The Land Before
Time.''
   ``Scrooged,'' based on Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' was
greeted coolly by critics, but set a record for the best five-day
Thanksgiving opening ($18.5 million) for a non-sequel movie. All
box-office proceeds, in fact, were significantly higher than last
weekend, thanks to the holiday and a flurry of new releases.
   ``The Land Before Time,'' which a week ago enjoyed the best
opening ever for an animated film, collected $8.1 million. The film
tells the story of a baby brontosaurus' dangerous journey through a
prehistoric world.
   Another animated movie, ``Oliver and Co.,'' finished third, up a
notch from last week. ``Oliver and Co.,'' employing a variety of
celebrity voices for the tale of a homeless kitten, grossed $6.3
million. The story was inspired by another Dickens tale, ``Oliver
Twist.''
   Debuting at No. 4 was the sequel ``Cocoon: The Return,'' an
updated look at a group of senior citizens enjoying everlasting
youth, with revenues of $5.6 million. It was followed by ``Ernest
Saves Christmas,'' in which an oddball cab driver (Jim Varney) saves
the holidays by driving Santa's sleigh. The movie had sales of $5.2
million.
   The horror movie ``Child's Play,'' featuring a homicidal doll on
the rampage, finished sixth with $4.6 million in sales. ``High
Spirits,'' starring Peter O'Toole as the proprietor of a
ghost-infested Irish castle, ended up seventh with receipts of $2
million.
   In eighth place was ``The Accused,'' starring Jodie Foster and
Kelly McGillis, with sales of $1.6 million. Rounding out the Top 10
were ``Fresh Horses,'' with Molly Ringwald, collecting $1.55 million
in ninth and ``Iron Eagle II,'' starring Louis Gossett, with a
reported gross of $1.35 million in 10th.
   The holiday film season continues to expand this week, with ``The
Naked Gun'' and ``Tequila Sunrise'' opening on Friday.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen for the weekend, total gross and number
of weeks in release. Total grosses include all days of release from
last Wednesday.
   1. ``Scrooged,'' Paramount, $13 million, 1,262 screens, $10,323
per screen, $18.5 million, one week.
   2. ``The Land Before Time,'' Universal, $8.1 million, 1,410
screens, $5,755 per screen, $18.5 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Oliver and Co.,'' Disney, $6.3 million, 952 screens, $6,658
per screen, $12 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Cocoon: The Return,'' 20th Century Fox, $5.6 million, 986
screens, $5,647 per screen, $7.7 million, one week.
   5. ``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' Disney, $5.2 million, 1,640
screens, $3,181 per screen, $6.4 million, three weeks.
   6. ``Child's Play,'' United Artists, $4.6 million, 1,490 screens,
$3,106 per screen, $22 million, three weeks.

per screen, $6.3 million, two weeks.
   8. ``The Accused,'' Paramount, $1.6 million, 851 screens, $1,880
per screen, $26.6 million, seven weeks.

   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand
a North Dakota law that the state has used to prosecute parents who
educate their children at home without being certified as teachers.
   North Dakota is considered to have the strongest restrictions on
home schooling, and Monday was the second time since 1985 the
Supreme Court has rejected without comment an appeal of the issue.
But opponents, saying the law violates their right to practice their
religion freely, said they remained hopeful of overturning the law
eventually.
   ``Like with a lot of other movements, it takes a while to get the
right case into the court at the right time,'' said the Rev. Clinton
Birst, executive director of the North Dakota Home School
Association. ``There are plenty of opportunities to get other
appeals there, too.''
   In challenging the law, Lawrence and Deborah Anderson, formerly
of Jamestown, and Mark and Lynette Dagley of Mandan said they
believe God gave them responsibility for their children, including
their education, and that sending them to school away from home
would violate their religious convictions.
   Mark Dagley said he and his wife will continue teaching their
five children at home, despite the setback Monday.
   ``We made a decision a long time ago that we were going to obey
God to the best of our ability,'' he said. ``We could be wrong. But
the way we understand what the Bible teaches is that we're supposed
to do this. ... Whatever has happened hasn't changed our viewpoints
at all.''
   The Andersons were fined $1,000 and the Dagleys $500 for
violating the state's compulsory school attendance law.
   The ruling shows it is not ``an unduly intrusive requirement to
ask that they (parents) provide a certified teacher or be one
themselves,'' said state Superintendent of Public Instruction Wayne
Sanstead.
   North Dakota is the only state that requires a parent to be a
certified teacher to educate a child at home, said J. Michael Smith,
vice president of the Home School Legal Defense Association, based
in Great Falls, Va.
   Iowa has a law requiring teacher certification in home schools,
but the state has stopped enforcing it for one year while
legislation is being considered to lift the requirement, he said.
   Most states require parents who wish to teach their children at
home to notify state officials about those plans, Smith said.
Students' progress is then monitored through standardized tests or
independent evaluations, he said.
   Most states have recognized the right of parents to teach their
children and ``what they have done is judged the product,'' Smith
said. ``How you get there is irrelevant.''
   Smith said the U.S. Supreme Court may have refused to hear
appeals of criminal convictions stemming from North Dakota's
compulsory attendance law because the issue affects so few people.
``North Dakota is an aberration,'' he said.
   At least 100 families are conducting illegal home schools in
North Dakota and 17 families have been prosecuted in the past five
years, Birst said.
   Fifteen home schools are operating with state approval, according
to the state Department of Public Instruction.
   The Andersons moved to Eau Claire, Wis., in part because of the
home school controversy in North Dakota and also for employment
reasons. The parents teach their children at home in Wisconsin,
Birst said.
   The North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the compulsory attendance
law last June, ruling the state's ``compelling interest in the
education of children'' permits some restriction on the free
exercise of religion.
   The only question is ``whether or not the state has chosen the
least restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest,''
the state court said.
   It said North Dakota could choose another system, such as
authorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring the
children's educational process. But the court said that alternative
might mean a more intrusive role for the state in supervising the
religious training of children.
   After the 1987 Legislature refused to change the compulsory
attendance law, a committee of leaders in education, religion and
law, appointed by Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth, failed to reach
a compromise in the longstanding dispute to recommend to the 1989
Legislature.

   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq on Monday
made his first visit to Egypt since taking office nine years ago for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak on Palestinian problems.
   Both leaders asked the United States to reconsider its decision
Saturday to bar Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, from entering the country to address the United
Nations in New York.
   Hussein said he was ``surprised by this narrow-minded attitude
from a superpower such as the United States which contradicts its
commitments to the United Nations,'' according to the Middle East
News Agency.
   The agency said Hussein expressed hope that Washington would
revise its action ``because this decision represents an offense not
only to Arafat but also to all Arabs and the whole world.''
   Mubarak made a similar appeal to the United States earlier in the
day.
   ``Arafat going to the United Nations would not cause problems for
the United States,'' Mubarak said. ``I think the United States
should have encourged this step because it is an important step by
the Palestinians.''
   Hussein told reporters at Cairo International Airport his visit
to Egypt was to discuss ``all matters of common concern to the two
countries and the Arab world in political, economic and other
fields,'' with top priority going to the Palestinian question,
according to the Middle East News Agency.
   Egypt and Iraq announced Sunday that their foreign ministers had
canceled plans to go to the U.N. for the debate on Palestinian
issues set to open Dec. 1.
   After meeting Hussein for lunch, Mubarak told reporters they
exchanged views on a number of issues including the Iran-Iraq peace
talks and the U.S. rejection of Arafat.
   Hussein's 10-hour visit to Egypt was his first since taking
office in 1979. Mubarak has visited Baghdad three times in the past
two years.
   Iraq severed diplomatic ties with Egypt in 1979 to protest its
peace treaty with Israel and resumed diplomatic relations in
November 1987.
   Despite the diplomatic break, Egypt supplied Iraq with nearly $2
billion in arms during Iraq's 8-year war with Iran. A
U.N.-negotiated cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20.

   Friend and foe alike criticized the United States on Monday for
denying PLO chief Yasser Arafat a visa to address the U.N. General
Assembly debate on the Palestinian issue. Only Israel supported the
decision.
   Most said the denial, announced Saturday by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, violated provisions of the 1947 U.N. Headquarters
Agreement requiring the United States not to interfere with U.N.
business.
   Many said the U.S. action countered what they described as the
Palestine Liberation Organization's move toward moderation with its
declaration of Palestinian independence Nov. 15 that also implicitly
recognized Israel.
   Arafat called U.S. rejection of his application ``a sheer
violation of international law.''
   ``Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and
explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' he said to reporters in
Baghdad, Iraq.
   Not even Britain, America's staunchest ally in Europe, expressed
approval. Friends asked Washington to reconsider and some Arab
nations pressed for the debate to be held in Geneva or Vienna so
Arafat could attend.
   A U.N. official said Arafat would be given a forum for addressing
the General Assembly but did not specify a location.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged Arab leaders to sever
relations with the United States.
   His official news agency quoted a letter to Arab kings and
presidents as saying: ``America has shown enough scorn towards the
Arab nation. Whenever she slaps our right cheek we turn the other
one. And therefore, relations with America have become ... a shame
in the face of every Arab.''
   The statement issued by Shultz said Arafat was denied a visa
because he was an ``accessory'' to terrorism committed by ``PLO
elements.'' Only Israel welcomed it.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said: ``Maybe now part of
the world will have to re-examine the situation and take another
look at the record of the PLO. It's quite a bloody record.''
   Canada formally conveyed its opposition to the U.S. decision to
both Washington and the United Nations, External Affairs Minister
Joe Clark said in a statement.
   ``We believe there is merit in hearing Mr. Arafat's views in an
international forum so that we and others can assess whether there
has been any change in the PLO's position on the peace process in
the Middle East,'' Clark said.
   Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
called the visa denial ``an unconstructive and illegal step.'' He
said it ``raises serious obstacles'' to peace in the Middle East and
``is deterimental to U.N. prestige and authority.''
   China's official news agency Xinhua said the United States ``has
failed to live up to the expectations of the world community, and
its decision has cast a dark shadow on the new hope for ending the
prolonged Arab-Israeli conflict.'' A British Foreign Office
spokesman said granting a visa was ``a matter for the United States
to decide'' but Britain ``would have liked to hear Arafat confirm in
New York that the PLO favored a settlement based on U.N. resolutions
242 and 338, and that it had renounced terrorism.''
   The resolutions implicitly recognize Israel and acceptance of
them has been a U.S. condition for U.S. contacts with the PLO.
Declarations issued Nov. 15 by the Palestine National Council, the
PLO legislature, restricted PLO attacks to military targets in
Israel and Israeli-occupied territories but did not specifically
renounce terrorism.
   West Germany said the decision was a blow to peace. Friedhelm
Ost, spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said: ``The universal
task of the United Nations and its function as a place for conflict
arbitration was not considered.''
   Other European nations criticizing Washington included Italy,
France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.
Australia, a U.S. ally, also complained.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Economic Community's
executive commission, said in Brussels he was ``surprised and
disappointed.'' He said he spoke as a private citizen.
   France's independent newspaper Le Monde said the decision was
``indefensible'' and Sweden's daily Aftonbladet called it ``an
appalling manifestation of imperialisti arrogance.''
   Tunisia, where the PLO has its headquarters, said refusing the
visa ``hinders the work of the United Nations as an instrument for
bringing about peace and security in the world.''
   Saudi Arabia's official news agency said the U.S. decision did
not ``harmonize with its principles of freedom, justice and peace in
the world.'' The Saudis are among the strongest U.S. allies in the
Persian Gulf region.
   Jordan and Egypt, two other Arab states with ties to Washington,
recommended moving the Palestine debate to Geneva.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said: ``Arafat's going to the
United Nations would not cause problems for the United States. I
think the United States should have encouraged this step because it
is an important step by the Palestinians.''

<HEAD>University's Dorm Rules Relax Overnight Guest Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ban on overnight dormitory guests that set off an
uproar at Boston University was slightly relaxed Monday, but
students still won't be able to play host to unrelated members of
the opposite sex.
   University President John Silber announced he had accepted with
``minor modifications'' recommendations of a task force appointed to
study the strict new rules after thousands of students demonstrated
against the policy.
   In his decision, Silber limited overnight guests of the opposite
sex to family members. Visits between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. will have
to be approved in writing by all roommates 24 hours in advance.
   ``The university recognizes and welcomes the fact that college
years are a time when young people change and mature _ in part
through testing their increased freedom and increased responsibility
for the conduct of their own lives.
   ``But this testing must be carried out within the bounds of good
manners,'' Silber wrote in a letter to the task force.
   The recommendations aren't substantially different than Silber's
original ban, said student Susheel Srikonda, who, along with another
student, formed a group called Active, Concerned, Together to fight
the new policies.
   The student group advocated a different approach that emphasized
roommate approval and gave the resident assistants who are in charge
of dormitories a larger role.
   University spokesman Kevin Carleton said he believed the task
force's recommendations were much more relaxed than the ban.
   ``The initial policy that was proposed was that there be no
overnight guests,'' he said. ``The tone of it was to discourage
overnight guests. This is saying that there certainly can be
overnight guests. It describes the format in which that can occur.''
   Controversy over the rules, which were announced in September,
was broadcast on national television after talk-show host Phil
Donahue visited campus to talk to administration officials and
student leaders.
   On Nov. 21, the task force gave Silber several recommendations,
including suggestions that overnight guests be allowed only at
certain times in the semester, a maximum of five times each semester
and only with approval from all roommates.
   Silber said in his letter he limited overnight guests to family
members out of consideration to parents ``who are, in a proportion
of about 30 to 1, opposed to overnight visitors of the opposite
sex.''
   He conceded that the university cannot police dormitories
rigorously but said the school is obliged to discourage certain
behavior.
   Carleton said the new rules probably will go into effect next
fall, although some technical details remain to be worked out.

   The English publishing rights to 14 books by
Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian writer who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in
literature, have been acquired by Doubleday, the publishing house
said.
   It also said that Doubleday U.K., a division of Transworld
Publishers Ltd. London, has acquired the English publishing rights
to a book on architecture by Britain's heir to the throne, Prince
Charles.
   Jacqueline Onassis, a Doubleday editor, and Alberto Vitale,
president and chief executive officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell
Publishing Group, who lived in Egypt for many years, acquired the
rights to Mahfouz's works from The American University in Cairo
Press, according to a news release.
   It was not immediately known how much Doubleday paid to acquire
the English rights to the works by Mahfouz and Prince Charles. The
publishing house could not be reached late Monday for comment.
   Nancy Evans, president and publisher of Doubleday, said in a
release last week that the company will publish 14 books by Mahfouz,
the first writer in the Arabic language to win the Nobel Prize in
literature.
   Mahfouz, 77, has written more than 30 novels and 12 volumes of
short stories. Doubleday will publish a collection of his short
stories and 13 of his novels, four of which have never been
published in English.
   Doubleday will publish three works by Mahfouz in fall 1989. In
1990, it will publish in hardcover the first volume of his
masterwork, ``The Cairo Trilogy,'' which was published in Arabic in
1957. The book depicts urban life in Egypt.
   The Press, which first published Mahfouz in English in 1978, is
the author's exclusive representative and will continue to publish
his books in English in Egypt.
   Prince Charles' book, ``A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of
Architecture,'' is based on his recent television documentary, which
sharply criticized modern architecture in Britain.
   It is to be published in Britain in March 1989, said Paul Sherer,
managing director of Transworld Publishers. Doubleday will publish
the book in the United States and Canada in fall 1989, said Evans.

   China and Mongolia signed a border treaty on
Monday calling for stability along their highly militarized mutual
border and the peaceful solution of territorial disputes.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said it was the first time China
signed a treaty on settling border issues.
   Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing and Mongolian First
Deputy Foreign Minister Daramyn Yundong signed the document, it said.
   Relations between China and the Mongolian People's Republic have
been strained for years because of Mongolia's close ties with the
Soviet Union and the presence of Soviet troops in Mongolia.
   The two countries have become closer with warming of
Chinese-Soviet relations and Moscow's withdrawal of about 12,000
troops from Mongolia last year. The Soviet Union still has about
50,000 troops stationed in Mongolia.
   Yundong told Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Mongolia wishes to
maintain friendly ties with both China and the Soviet Union and
hopes its two giant neighbors will further improve their relations,
Xinhua reported.

   Sen. Quentin Burdick, an 80-year-old Democrat
re-elected after a campaign in which his health was an issue,
underwent hospital tests Monday to find the cause of a seizure he
suffered at home, his staff said.
   Burdick was listed in stable condition in the intensive care unit
of St. Luke's Hospitals, where he was taken by ambulance about 10:30
p.m. Sunday, aides said.
   A CAT scan Monday showed no signs of a stroke, internal bleeding
or tumors, but Burdick was scheduled to undergo further tests on his
heart and brain, including an electroencephalogram, or EEG, said
David Strauss, the senator's chief spokesman.
   Burdick's health and competence were issues in the 1988 campaign,
during which he maintained he was in excellent health. He defeated
Republican Earl Strinden with nearly 60 percent of the vote.
   He had a portion of his colon removed in August at Bethesda Naval
Hospital in Maryland because of cancer and was hospitalized in Fargo
a year ago after slipping on ice and hurting his head.
   ``To the best of our knowledge none of this (the seizure) is
related to his colon surgery or other problems'' related to the
fall, Strauss said.
   Burdick was conscious when he was taken to the hospital and was
alert Monday, aides said. His wife was with him at the hospital,
Strauss said.

<TEXT>
   Opposition party supporters who seized 30 city
halls throughout Michoacan state during the weekend still occupied
five municipal buildings late Monday, state officials said.
   Michoacan state spokesman Armando Palomino said activists
voluntarily left most of the city halls. But the Excelsior news
service quoted other opposition activists as saying police and
military forces drove many away.
   Salvador Guzman, a spokesman for the State Attorney General's
Office, on Monday denied that police were sent to end the
occupations, saying ``it was the army.''
   Army officials in the Michoacan state capital of Morelia refused
comment.
   The city halls were seized by supporters of the National
Democratic Front on Saturday to demand the ouster of Michoacan Gov.
Luis Martinez Villicana, a member of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   No injuries were reported either during the takeovers. Palomino
said five town halls remained occupied but he didn't know which.
   Ricardo Saldana, Michoacan spokesman for the PRI, as the ruling
party is known, confirmed Monday that the state dispatched troops to
prevent more city hall takeovers.
   Saldana said small groups of soldiers were sent to ``protect''
city halls first occupied by Democratic Front supporters on
Saturday. He said troops also were dispatched to prevent activists
from taking over other city halls.
   Front activists said they were occupying the city halls to press
their demands that Martinez Villicana resign. The governor was
elected to a six-year-term in 1986.
   But Palomino said some activists told officials ``they were
invited to take over the installations to support Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas when he assumes the presidency on Dec. 1.''
   The Democratic National Front supported Cardenas in his
unsuccessful July 6 bid for the presidency. PRI candidate Carlos
Salinas de Gortari won the presidency in the disputed election and
is to take office Thursday.
   A statement signed by the Democratic National Front's 13 federal
deputies and two senators representing Michoacan called Martinez
Villicana's administration ``the most immoral, demogagic and
unworthy in the entire history of the state,'' according to Monday's
edition of the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada.

   A gold deposit containing a possible 2 million
ounces of gold has been discovered in central Idaho, a precious
metals company announced Monday.
   Meridan Gold Co., a subsidiary of Burlington Resources Inc.,
discovered the deposit at its Beartrack Joint Venture property near
Salmon, which is 150 miles northwest of Idaho Falls.
   Meridian said an independent consulting geologist estimated the
site could contain about 2.03 million ounces of gold.
   Meridian is the manager of the Beartrack venture, with a 60
percent share. Canyon Resources Corp. of Golden, Colo., and its
partners own the remaining 40 percent.
   More than 100 test holes have been drilled at the 50-square-mile
site. Meridian plans additional drilling and geologic studies before
deciding next year whether to develop a mine.
   Glenn Dobbs, an analyst with Neidiger-Tucker-Bruner in Bellevue,
Wash., said the discovery is significant by North American
standards. He said, however, it would have no effect on the world
supply or price of gold.
   Typically, he said, the gold would be mined over many years, at
rates up to 120,000 ounces, or 7,500 pounds, a year.
   The United States will produce about 130 tons of gold this year,
with world production of over 1,600 tons.

   A Japanese department store bought Pablo Picasso's
``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for $38.46 million Monday night at
Christie's, the highest price ever paid at auction for a 20th
century work of art.
   The painting was purchased by the Mitsukoshi Department Store,
store spokesman Yasuhiro Tanaka said in Tokyo.
   ``We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer
here in Tokyo,'' Tanaka said. Mitsukoshi, a major importer of art,
has not yet decided on specific plans for the display or sale of the
painting, Tanaka said.
   A picture by the French Impressionist Claude Monet, ``The
Railroad Bridge at Argenteuil,'' sold for $12.55 million, also
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at
auction.
   In June 28, another Monet painting, ``In the Field,'' sold at
Sotheby's in London for $24.90 million.
   Spokesmen for the auction house did not disclose the purchaser or
the seller of the Picasso painting. They only identified the seller
as a private owner.
   The 1905 work from the artist's Rose Period was sold in 3{
minutes. Bidding opened at 5 million pounds ($9.2 million) and ended
at 20.9 million pounds ($38.46 million). The price topped the
previous record for a 20th century painting, $24.75 million paid for
Picasso's ``Maternity'' Nov. 14 in New York.
   Monday's auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought 55.44 million
pounds ($102.01 million), a record for an Impressionist and modern
art sale in London. Individual records were set for works by
Picasso, Paul Gauguin, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee and Paul Signac.
   Christie's had offered 69 paintings for sale, but nine were
withdrawn or did not reach the minimums set by the owners.
   After being shown in Paris in 1905, ``Acrobat and Young
Harlequin'' found its way into a German museum and was confiscated
by the Nazis in 1937 as an example of decadent art. They sold it at
auction in Switzerland to a Belgian collector and it had been in
private hands since.
   Japan's imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years
as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of
investment.
   In March 1987, Vincent Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' painted in
1889, sold for $39.9 million at Christie's in London to Yasuda Fire
and Marine Insurance Co., a Japanese firm.
   Dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art sales
are to Japanese buyers _ often large corporations that buy for
tax-free investment purposes.
   Picasso did the painting in 1905 in his Paris attic studio at 13
rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque watercolor easier to handle
than oil paint.
   Auctioneer Charles Allsopp said the price paid for the painting
was by no means exorbitant.
   ``By any standard, Picasso was the towering figure of art in this
century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually
considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series
likely to come on the market,'' Allsopp said.
   ``In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture.
It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who don't
like Picasso.''

   The Arab Group of U.N. member states planned to meet today to

   President Reagan says PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat was denied permission to enter the United States because the
administration could not risk showing the world that ``we were
patsies'' to terrorism.
   Reagan said Sunday that he agreed ``very much'' with Secretary of
State George P. Shultz's decision that Arafat should not be granted
entrance to the United States because of the U.S. belief that the
PLO supports terrorism.
   Arafat sought an entry visa to address the U.N. General Assembly
Dec. 1-2 on the Palestinian issue. In the wake of the U.S. refusal
to admit him to this country, Arafat has urged that the General
Assembly move its Palestinian session to Geneva, Switzerland, and
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar accused the United
States of violating its U.N. treaty.
   The U.S. decision has been assailed by Arab groups. But all three
Democrats seeking the top party leadership post in the Senate
offered their support. A spokesman for President-elect George Bush
said Bush had not been consulted in advance of the weekend State
Department announcement.

   Saudi Arabia's proposal to lower the
benchmark price of crude oil from $18 to $15 a barrel threatens a
tentative accord aimed at reducing the world oil glut and driving up
prices.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said late Sunday the
proposal was designed to prevent prices from falling below $15. But
other ministers fear that a minimum price could become the ceiling
price.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries currently
maintains a benchmark of $18 a barrel, but prices recently have been
running at $14 or less.
   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means a
pickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although oil
companies do not always pass along the full increase.

   Gorbachev was reacting to a wave of nationalist unrest that has

   He said in a speech broadcast on state television Sunday that
``attempts are being made to kindle dislike in the interethnic

   As engineers struggle with the aging plants

   One proposed design, the smaller and more expensive of two
envisioned, involves technologies that some engineers believe will
lead to commercial reactors that drastically reduce the dangers of
meltdown and contamination.
   Building new reactors has assumed new urgency since April, when

candidate for a diplomatic career.
   ``I am absolutely outraged,'' Rabby said in a telephone interview

   ``It is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Japan Abuses Tropical Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONIKA JAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has abused the world's tropical forests in
flagrantly wasteful ways and in the long run may upset the global
ecological balance, a group of environmentalists contend.
   They also claim that with a recent shipment of banned giant raw
logs from Brazil, Japan has managed to open up the last major timber
frontier _ Latin America _ following the near depletion of forest
land in Africa and Southeast Asia.
   ``Japan is the largest importer of tropical hardwood and we
consume the biggest amount,'' said Saburo Okita, chairman of the
Japan chapter of the World Wide Fund for Nature, known as the World
Wildlife Fund in the United States, Canada and Australia.
   According to the International Tropical Timber Organization,
Japan imports 60 percent of the 421 million cubic feet of timber it
uses annually.
   Some of the wood goes into disposable chopsticks and panels for
poured-concrete forms on construction projects. Yuta Harago, a
wildlife fund consultant, calls these wasteful uses for which
alternatives can be found.
   ``Ten percent of Japan's industrial waste alone is made up of the
discarded wood used for the paneling,'' he said.
   Okita and fund officials spoke at news conferences marking the
recent meeting in Yokohama of the International Tropical Timber
Organization, which groups countries that produce and consume timber.
   Okita, a former foreign minister, said Japan overuses foreign
timber because it was easily available at low prices during the
reconstruction period after World War II. Because of that, the local
timber industry ignores the forests covering 70 percent of the
Japanese islands, Okita added.
   Gordon Shepherd of the World Wildlife Fund said the Japanese
forestry industry has limited cutting to try to sustain its supply
of trees, and so domestic hardwood is more expensive than imports.
   Most of the timber comes from Southeast Asia where some forests
have been virtually stripped clean.
   ``And Africa is also in very bad shape,'' said Julio Cesar
Centeno, director of the Latin American Forestry Institute in
Venezuela.
   ``So the interest of the world trade is turning toward Latin
America because the forests are still there and the possibility of
its exports are just beginning to show,'' Centeno said.
   According to the wildlife fund, Latin America has 60 percent of
the world's tropical forests while its exports constitute only 5
percent of the global trade.
   ``Many people agree that Latin America is going to play a very
important role in the tropical timber trade by the end of the
century,'' said Centeno.
   Over the past few years several Asian timber producing nations
have banned the export of raw logs to let their forests recover. In
October, Brazil also announced it will prohibit the sale of the logs
in answer to international criticism over the destruction of its
Amazon forests.
   But in early November, 386,100 cubic feet of Brazilian raw logs
arrived in Japan, the result of a loophole in Brazil's ban, said
Adam Markham, the wildlife fund's campaigns officer
   ``The reason given for the imported logs is that the land is
going to have to be cleared anyway because the forests will be
flooded by hydroelectric dams,'' he said. With a special permit, the
Brazilian timber industry was able to sell the logs to Japan.
   Centeno said other countries in Latin America will want to open
up their forests because of ``unfair competition'' from Brazil.
   ``If you can get a special permit with this argument (the dam
project), you can get another permit for expanding the agricultural
frontier or the building of ranches or any other argument
practically,'' he added.
   Uprooting trees worldwide will eventually have ``very strong
consequences on the environment,'' Centeno said.
   ``There is discussion whether destruction of the forests will
affect the temperature of the planet, the winds, rains. It may have
worldwide ecological damage,'' he said.
   Motokatsu Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry's liaison officer with
the International Tropical Timber Organization, said the private
sector in Japan has not seen the danger of deforestation.
   A major goal for the government, he said, is to increase public
awareness of environmental matters.

<BYLINE>Snail Farming in Britain: Is it Really Escargot?
^By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RODE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of tiny snail farms are popping up
across Britain, and the growing interest in the new industry is
threatening an escargot glut.
   Despite a lingering British prejudice against snails as mere
garden pests, consumption is growing at an estimated 10 to 20
percent a year, and a feud has already erupted over what constitutes
an escargot.
   On one side is a group led by a Frenchman backing the helix
snail, the traditional favorite of France. On the other are farmers
championing the fast-breeding achatina snail, which the French have
recently deemed unfit to be called escargot.
   ``The war is declared as far as the escargot is concerned,'' says
Jacques Aubree, the Frenchman whose British Snail Farmers
Association has enlisted 54 growers since 1986 to breed the helix
snails he calls the ``aristocrat of escargot.''
   ``What's an escargot anyway? It's a snail,'' retorts Roy Groves,
founder of The Snail Center, a Welsh-based group that claims 300
members worldwide, including 40 British farmers breeding achatina
indoors in pens.
   Aubree, who tells visitors to his farm in Rode, near Bath, to
tread carefully to avoid ``stepping on my profit,'' believes the
tropical achatina are less tasty than the helix he grows outdoors on
pesticide-free land.
   The French agree, and passed a law in May forbidding achatina to
be called escargot. The intent was to stop unscrupulous
restaurateurs from putting achatina meat in helix shells.
   ``If people in Britain are prepared to eat slugs in fancy shells,
I don't care,'' said Aubree, a former chef, speaking of the
achatina's larger shells.
   Says Groves: ``We don't have preconceived ideas in this country.
... The achatina is an excellent edible snail.''
   He notes that his snails can be harvested more quickly than the
helix breed, although they sell for 1.60 pounds ($2.90) a pound,
compared with 2.30 pounds ($4.15) a pound for helix.
   The National Farmers' Union estimates annual British consumption
at 90 tons at most, compared with 10,000 to 12,000 tons in France,
the world's No. 1 consumer, which imports half its supply, mainly
from Greece, the Soviet Union, Turkey and eastern Europe.
   ``There is no doubt that in the majority of British people's
minds, it's still that lump of rubber served in garlic butter,''
said Charles Wells, whose 72-member cooperative Britsnail was
founded this year to sell both achatina and helix snails.
   ``It will take time to establish the snail,'' he added. ``I think
if the industry is going to go ahead, it has to consolidate.
   ``I say, `Look gentlemen, forget your differences, we are trying
to produce a British crop like sheep and goats and anything else,'''
he said.
   With the National Farmers' Union estimating that each farmer
could produce six tons a year of helix and 15 tons of achatina,
officials worry about how many more snail farmers Britain can handle.
   ``There is room for expansion but ... we're very chary about
encouraging people in joining an industry so embryonic,'' said an
official of the government's Agriculture Development and Advisory
Service, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The farmers' union says it is worried about a snail surplus that
would lower prices and quality.
   Still, snail farmers like Judy Candy, a helix-grower in Aubree's
cooperative, believe their product has a future.
   The Candys, who saw snails as a way to branch out from dairy cows
and corn on their farm near Bristol, haven't sold any snails but are
optimistic.
   ``They're restful,'' she said. ``It's a bit like tropical fish.
You can't really get annoyed with a snail. ... They don't rampage
about and knock things over.''

<HEAD>Group in Spain out to Ban Bullfighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSE TINSLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ban bullfighting in Spain? It's as if
someone wanted to ban baseball in the United States.
   But a group of Spaniards, nevertheless, wants to put an end to
what it sees as cruelty in the bullring.
   The Spanish Animal Rights Association and several European
Parliament deputies have launched a Europe-wide petition drive
calling on governments to adopt legislation that would ban
bullfighting in Spain and France and fox hunting in Britain, France
and Ireland.
   The petition, which organizers say would carry half a million
signatures, is to be given to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain in January in Brussels, Belgium, shortly after Spain assumes
the rotating presidency of the European Economic Community for the
first time.
   While organizers want animal protection legislation passed in all
12 EEC member states, the petition is aimed specifically at ending
or ``modernizing'' bullfighting in Spain and doing away with the
torturing or killing of animals during many traditional religious
festivals around the country.
   Making bullfighting ``modern'' or acceptable to opponents would
involve eliminating the picadors on horseback who lance the bull to
weaken its neck muscles so its head goes down, the banderilleros who
spike the animal's neck muscles with three pairs of long darts, and
the final act _ the moment of truth _ when the matador stabs the
bull between the shoulder blades and through the heart.
   In neighboring Portugal, the bull is picked lightly by a
bullfighter on horseback, then grabbed by the tail by a group of men
called ``forcados'' and wrestled around until it is dazed. The bull
does not die in the ring but is slaughtered shortly afterward in
packing-house fashion.
   The proposed legislation would also eliminate the use of horses
during bullfights, prohibit young people from attending and force
televised fights into a late-night time slot when children are in
bed.
   Carlos Briones, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior which
oversees bullfighting, said the government had no official comment
on the subject.
   But Briones said he personally feels bullfighting is part of
Spanish culture and should be maintained.
   Bullfighting is considered an art rather than a sport in Spain.
   This past season, 23 million people attended bullfights in Spain,
3 million more than 1987. The capitals of 49 of Spain's 52 provinces
have permament bullrings, and during the summer months portable
rings are set up in thousands of towns and villages for their annual
fiestas.
   The number of major fights rose 11 percent this year to 566, the
highest number in the past decade.
   A first-class bullfighter earns from $27,000 to $35,000 to fight
three bulls in an afternoon during the big fiestas in Madrid,
Seville, Bilbao, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Malaga and Valencia.
   Spain's leading bullfighter of the moment, Espartaco, fought 82
``corridas'' _ three-bull afternoons _ during the past season.
   Bullfighting and animal sacrifice in religious festivals are
centuries-old traditions in Spain. Dona Mercedes de Borbon, the
mother of King Juan Carlos, is an avid bullfight aficionada, and the
king occasionally makes an appearance at Madrid's Las Ventas ring,
the world's largest.
   Last year the government of the autonomous region of Catalonia in
northeastern Spain banned the torturing and sacrificing of animals
in religious festivals but still permits bullfighting.
   The Spanish Animal Rights Association, an organization of 2,000
members and 8,000 contributors, says Spain is the only EEC country
that does not consider mistreatment of animals a criminal offense.
   The association's vice president, Consuelo Polo, said there has
been a resurgence of ritualistic street festivals since the death in
1975 of Gen. Francisco Franco, who banned animal taunting and
sacrifice connected with them during his 36 years of authoritarian
rule.
   ``They don't think it's a fiesta unless they have bulls running
through the streets,'' she said.
   On most Sundays during the bullfighting season _ March to October
_ association members stand outside bullrings, at Madrid's Prado
Museum and on the southern Costa del Sol beaches handing out
literature in an effort to discourage tourists from attending
bullfights.
   But Pedro Geraldo, a bullfighter for 14 years, says Spaniards not
only respect the bullfighters but the bull for its courage and
beauty.
   ``It's an art that is sometimes misunderstood by foreigners,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Making Money in Stocks Requires Consistency and Persistence</HEAD>

   The greatest financial gift that most young
people could receive is a lesson in how persistence and consistency
can lead to enormous rewards in the stock market.
   Alas, the course laid out is seldom followed. The route chosen is
often a bumpy one; shortcuts lead to dead ends and detours that
dissipate both the funds and a sense of the original goal.
   But in theory if not in practice, the route is a simple one of
investing, reinvesting dividends as they are earned, and waiting.
   A common stock investment of $1,000 made at the end of 1925, for
example, would have grown to more than $375,000 at the end of 1987
if left alone. That same $1,000 invested in small company stocks
would have reached $1.45 million.
   These calculations were made by Gerald Perritt, a mathematician
and chairman of the Chicago-based advisory firm Investment
Information Services. In the first instance the annual return was a
nominal 9.9 percent. In the second, the smaller company stocks would
have returned 12.1 percent.
   You can be certain, however, that few if any individuals ever
followed that simple route for the length of time required.
Dividends would have been spent rather than reinvested. Fundn 62 years.
And in real terms, it lost 60 percent of
its purchasing power.
   It is a lesson for all ages. If you are 20 years old you should
keep it in mind for your own retirement. If you are 65, put some
money away for your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
   And tie it up in a hands-off trust.

<HEAD>State of Stroessner's Health is a Whispered Topic in Paraguay</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Stroessner, a stocky,
vigorous man of robust health and immense appetite for his job,
walked out of the National Palace one Friday in late August and was
not seen again in public for two weeks.
   The absence was without precedent since Stroessner took power by
coup 34 years ago and was unexplained to Paraguayans accustomed to
seeing him virtually every day on television or the front page of
Patria, the newspaper of the ruling Colorado Party.
   What happened was that the 76-year-old Stroessner _ who,
according to government propaganda, never gets sick, never takes
vacations and spends part of almost every day on the job _ underwent
a prostate operation.
   To this day, that has not been publicly reported to Paraguay's 4
million people. Many officials won't speak of it even privately,
holding to the government version that Stroessner had a routine
medical checkup and is fine.
   ``We asked him, `Why don't we issue an official bulletin saying
you had a prostate operation?' '' Martin Chiola, vice president of
the Colorado Party, said in an interview.
   He said Stroessner refused on grounds that his health was his own
affair.
   Opponents hold, however, that Stroessner's health is a public
issue because it affects his capacity to rule, and they don't
believe he is well.
   He no longer arrives for work just after sunrise and leaves
before noon. He receives fewer people than before and passes on to
his aides the work he used to do himself. Those who have seen him
says he walks and speaks slowly, and looks pallid.
   ``For television, they only let the photographers take pictures
from far away, and at an angle,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, owner of the
newspaper ABC Color, which was closed by the government in 1984. ``A
year ago, the pictures were in clear focus.''
   ``He has aged visibly. He has lost his force,'' said Roman
Catholic Bishop Mario Melanio Medina, an outspoken critic of the
regime. ``There is a feeling that he won't be around for long.''
   Rumors swept this sleepy, steamy capital the first week of
September that he had died. Many were left dumbstruck.
   ``It demonstrated his fallibility,'' said Domingo Laino, leader
of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, a group denied formal
recognition by the government but which may be Paraguay's largest
opposition group. ``It pushed people to think post-Stroessner.''
   Colorado's Chiola, who also is vice president of the Chamber of
Deputies in the Congress, acknowleged as much in an interview in his
office at the Legislative Palace.
   ``Nobody in the country thought he could get sick,'' said Chiola.
``Now, people are thinking that at some point there will have to be
a succession.''
   Stroessner's seizure of power in 1954 ended a 22-year period of
anarchy and misrule in which Paraguay suffered a war with Bolivia, a
civil war, and a dozen presidents.
   For more than three decades, he has provided stability, if not
social peace, to a country that since independence from Spain in
1811 almost never has had free elections, independent political
institutions or fair party competition.
   Laino, a former congressional deputy who has been imprisoned and
exiled, and others see Stroessner in decline. They are pressing for
a transition to a representative government in which they can
participate.
   The Roman Catholic Church, to which the majority of Paraguayans
nominally belong, advocates constitutional reform, an amnesty of
political prisoners, a crackdown on contraband and corruption, a
raise in the minimum wage, equal rights for women.
   There's grumbling even within the Colorado Party, which claims a
membership of 1.4 million. Students at the National University are
joining dissident organizations, and party regulars are split
between ``militants'' who unswervingly back Stroessner and
``traditionalists'' who do not.
   ``The Colorado Party has abandoned many of its flags _ unions,
farmers _ and turned into a massive bureaucracy,'' claimed Leandro
Prieto Yegros, a Colorado member of Congress.
   Edgar Insfran, Stroessner's interior minister in 1956-66, said,
``Stroessner has lost a lot of support within the past few years. He
is seen as excessively authoritarian in a way that cannot continue.''
   ``Militant'' Colorados talk little of transition. They are
willing to wait, knowing that their constitutional two-thirds
control of Congress will allow them to choose Stroessner's
successor, if he cannot continue in office.
   There is no open challenger to Stroessner and no apparent
fissures in the military, the real power in Paraguay.
   The opposition seems hopelessly fractured and incapable of
uniting behind a single candidate or group.
   Prieto Yegros describes the opposition as ``infants'' and
``crazies,'' and dismisses them as a credible force.
   ``In politics, nobody gives anything for nothing,'' he said.
``People who can't even organize themselves won't participate in any
transition.''
   ABC Color owner Zuccolillo agrees his colleagues at the moment
cannot back up their demands for change.
   ``The post-Stroessner process is going to begin only after he
dies,'' Zuccolillo said. ``He's going to die in power, either as
president of the republic or commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
There is nothing that will stop that.''
   The presidential press secretary, Juan Jose Benitez Rickman, says
he sees no reason to doubt Stroessner will complete his term of
office, which runs through 1993.
   Asked about Stroessner's health, Benitez Rickman would only point
to a copy of a letter Stroessner signed recently with his signature
that looks like a capital H.
   ``Look, his hand doesn't tremble,'' he said. ``It shows firmness
and authority. President Stroessner is in perfect health and thanks
be to God for that.''

   Says Platt: ``You can't find someone in the hospital who doesn't
think about it frequently.''
   This doesn't mean that people with AIDS receive poor care from
quaking doctors and nurses. While some surgeons are reluctant to
operate and some nurses may try to minimize contact, experts say
there are plenty of others who selflessly put aside their
apprehensions. At many hospitals, teams of doctors and nurses have
evolved who are intensely protective of their AIDS patients,
treating them with compassion and skill.
   Often the most timid are those who have, perhaps by choice, the
least direct contact with the disease. Dr. Deborah Cotton of Beth
Israel Hospital in Boston says the intensity of this fear is often
out of proportion to the risk of catching it.
   ``As a group, health care workers are probably no more or less
fearful than the general public, and that's of great concern,'' she
says. ``They should clearly be less fearful. They have more
information.''
   Reasonable caution in the hospital makes sense. Ordinary contact
with infected people is safe, but doctors and nurses can catch the
virus if infected blood mingles with their own, entering their
bodies through a cut or a needle jab. The risk is probably highest
in the operating room, the emergency room and the delivery room, the
bloodiest places in the hospital.
   According to Dr. Julie Gerberding of San Francisco General, 23
cases of probable on-the-job infection of health care workers have
been reported around the world, although there undoubtedly are other
cases that haven't come to public attention. They are 14 nurses, six
lab workers, one non-surgical physician, one dentist and one home
health care provider. All had direct contact with AIDS-infected
blood, most often accidental needle sticks.
   The virus is hard to catch. Even when jabbed by a needle covered
with infected blood, the odds of infection are longer than 1 in 200.
However, jabs and cuts are common, especially in the operating room.
According to one estimate, emergency department surgeons who operate
on lots of infected people may have a 2 percent annual risk of
catching the AIDS virus while working.
   Outright refusal to treat infected people is rare, although it
does happen.
   ``It's hard to go near a teaching hospital in the United States
where somebody who treats persons with AIDS has not had somebody
refuse or hesitate to do an invasive procedure,'' says Daniel Fox,
who teaches humanities in medicine at the State University of New
York in Stony Brook.
   It is more than an understandable reluctance to get sick and die,
several doctors say. It is a reluctance to get sick and die for
people that physicians don't like.
   ``We associate the AIDS epidemic with drug abusers and
homosexuals,'' says Silverman. ``In the back of your mind, you say,
`I'm not going to die for this.'''
   There are strong ethical taboos against refusing to treat someone
solely out of fear of catching his disease. But doctors may safely
hide behind another shield _ simple ignorance. Some experts say that
many primary care physicians have failed to learn about AIDS so they
can refer infected people elsewhere. They can say, quite honestly,
that they are not competent to treat their condition.
   ``If it was some other disease, would physicians become more
rapidly informed about it?'' asked Dr. James Noble of New England
Medical Center. ``I think that a lot of what the patients perceive
as rejection at a very vulnerable time in their lives is more
reluctance on the part of doctors to get involved than it is
outright hostility toward them, although that occurs, also.''
   Many physicians complain that surgeons are more likely to say
that operations are unnecessary if patients are infected. At
hospitals with large numbers of AIDS patients, AIDS referral
networks have grown up. Internists send their patients to surgeons,
radiologists and other specialists who they know will take their
patients without quibbling.
   One of the few people to study these attitudes is Dr. R. Nathan
Link, an internist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. He
surveyed interns and residents at two New York hospitals and found
that about 40 percent reported moderate or major concern about
getting AIDS from their patients. A quarter say that if given a
choice, they would not take care of people with the disease.
   ``By far, the biggest issue was fear of contagion to
themselves,'' says Link. ``That's human nature. Above all else,
you're worried about your own hide.''

   When surgeons reach into patients' incisions, many
of them want to know if they are dipping their hands in
AIDS-infected blood.
   Doctors and nurses frequently worry about catching AIDS from
their patients. But the concern is probably nowhere deeper than in
the operating room.
   Surgeons frequently cut and puncture their fingers. Knives and
fine thread effortlessly slice through latex gloves, their only
protection.
   ``Talk to cardiac surgeons whose hands are often in blood,'' says
Dr. Sheldon Wolff, an infectious disease expert at New England
Medical Center. ``They often nick themselves and yeah, it bothers
the hell out of them. It's easy to say, `You've taken an oath that
says you've got to operate on everybody,' but these guys are putting
themselves at risk, and they make cogent arguments for wanting to
know the status of the patient in terms of HIV infection.''
   Infectious disease specialists such as Wolff urge surgeons to
assume that every patient is infected and take all possible
precautions with all of them.
   They and many other non-surgical physicians oppose broad-based
AIDS screening of hospital patients. They argue that results showing
infection may be hard to keep secret, and they could lead to
discrimination, even a refusal to perform an operation or other
procedure.
   There is also a minuscule chance that the test will fail to spot
people who are infected, so screening might encourage a misplaced
sense of security.
   Surgeons respond that when a patient is infected, they have a
right to know it. If they know they are operating on an infected
patient, they will be extra careful and take precautions that are
impractical for all operations.
   As a result, some surgeons ask patients for permission to check
their blood for the AIDS virus, HIV, before surgery.
   ``In the operating room, we have pump technicians, circulators,
anesthesiologists, scrub nurses,'' says Dr. Norman Silverman of the
University of Illinois. ``We are talking about a lot of people and a
big investment in their future and education. They have a right to
know if the patient is positive or not. You'll be five times more
careful and double-glove wherever you stick your finger.''
   Generally, doctors ask permission before AIDS testing, and in
some states such approval is legally required. Some surgeons screen
all patients, while others check only homosexuals, drug addicts or
anyone else who might be at high risk of infection. Doctors say the
patients rarely refuse.
   ``I think it's quite reasonable to ask a patient who is at some
risk if he can be tested. I think most of us do it,'' says Dr.
George Sheldon of the University of North Carolina. ``There may be
some patients you might ask, even though they aren't in a risk
group, if you have a reason that is more intuitive than factual.''
   Some surgeons, however, oppose this use of the test. For
instance, Dr. Albert Bothe of New England Deaconess Hospital says he
thinks AIDS testing is justifiable only if it helps the patient, not
the doctor.
   ``What about the patient who comes into the emergency room and
you don't know?'' Bothe asked. ``Do you wait until the test is done?
What about patients who have the virus and their test was negative?
And then what different is the surgeon going to do?''
   None of the 23 victims of probable on-the-job AIDS infection
among health care workers reported so far is a surgeon. Whether any
of the special precautions they take with infected patients will
keep them from getting the virus is unclear. Among those frequently
mentioned:
   _Wear two pairs of gloves.
   _Minimize passing sharp instruments between the surgeon and scrub
nurse.
   _Use automatic staplers rather than stitches.
   _Cut with an electric cautery rather than a scalpel.
   _Keep medical students out of the operating room.
   _Make sure the operation is performed by a seasoned surgeon, not
an inexperienced resident who might be more likely to cut other
people at the operating table.

   BOSTON (AP) _ New hospital procedures intended to keep doctors
and nurses from catching the AIDS virus are spelled out in an
evolving series of recommendations known as ``universal
precautions.''
   The rules are called universal because they are supposed to apply
to all patients. Outwardly healthy people may harbor the virus in
their blood, so the new practices encourage hospital workers to
treat all blood as though it is infected.
   These precautions, compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, include:
   _Gloves should be worn when touching patients' mucous membranes,
non-intact skin and a variety of body fluids, including blood,
semen, vaginal secretions, spinal fluid and amniotic fluid. They
should also be worn when handling items soiled with these fluids,
giving shots or drawing blood.
   _Hands should be washed immediately after gloves are removed.
   _Masks and protective glasses should be worn during procedures
when blood may fly into health workers' faces. Soak-proof gowns or
aprons should also be used if blood or other fluids are likely to be
splattered.
   _Health workers should be especially careful not to jab
themselves with needles, scalpels or other sharp instruments.
Needles should not be recapped. After they are used, they should be
put in puncture-proof containers. These containers should be
conveniently placed around the hospital.
   _Mouthpieces or resuscitation bags should be available to
minimize the need for emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When it comes to stamps, millions of citizens
seem to have ideas about what should go on them. Pressure and
controversy can get pretty intense (as in behalf of the Elvis
Presley stamp). That's why the committee that decides meets behind
closed doors and never explains its reasoning for picking one

   They are America's headstones, its family
albums.
   Stamps.
   It used to be the U.S. Postal Service would put George Washington
(282 times) or Ben Franklin (133) on its postage and hope they would
stick.
   But in the 2,500-plus stamps since the first Washington-Franklins
of 1847, postage has become more than just glued paper. Today's
stamps are colorful as rainbows, varied as flea markets and one of
the most exclusive portrait galleries in the world.
   Every year some 25-30,000 native sons, bypassed heroes, worthy
causes, deserving luminaries, memorable landscapes and happy
birthdays are proposed for a stamp. Only 25 or 30 make it.
   Once upon a time Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a collector, would
call up Postmaster General Jim Farley with an idea and tell him to
get printing. Today, in the course of human events, a committee
decides.
   Who, how, what, when, where?
   ``It's about as democratic a process as we have going,'' says
Dickey Rustin, manager for stamp information at the Postal Service.
   The deciders, appointed by the postal commissioners for the last
30 years, are the 13 members of the Citizens Stamp Advisory
Committee. They meet here six times a year to decide, by majority
vote, whom you will be sticking your tongue out at on the way to the
post office.
   The decisions tend to be upbeat. Wyatt Earp stands a better
chance of being postally canonized than Billy the Kid. (Jesse James
was proposed and turned down. So was a pretzel with beer-flavored
glue). It helps to be good looking. We've had cardinals and bald
eagles and poinsettias. No turkey buzzards.
   Beyond the certitude that there will always be a stamp in
circulation showing the American flag (54 times) it is difficult to
make book on who will make the postal hall of fame.
   Consider:
   We have had Abraham Lincoln but not Jefferson Davis; Babe Ruth
but not Roger Maris; Lewis and Clark but not Zebulon Pike; Crazy
Horse but not George Armstrong Custer; Canada but not Japanese
cherry trees; paddy wagons but not Bonnie and Clyde; Mary Cassatt
but not Jackson Pollack; John Harvard but not Elihu Yale; Jack
London but not Irving Berlin; jack in the pulpit but not skunk
cabbage; a Frank Lloyd Wright house but not an outhouse (proposed
and flushed); Nobelists Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner and John
Steinbeck but not Nobelist Ernest Hemingway; Duke Ellington but not
King Louis Armstrong; Hoover, Herbert but not Hoover, J. Edgar;
Feeding the Hungry but not fat farms.
   Conversely, or perversely, we have had population control and
baby carriages, Mexican independence and the Battle of San Jacinto.
   One might surmise that Custer and Jeff Davis are in limbo because
they lost, Hemingway because he took his own life, Maris because of
his asterisk. You'll never know because the committee doesn't
publicly explain its reasoning.
   When John Harvard was stamped in 1986 to celebrate his namesake
university's 350th birthday, that opened the door for Yalies and
loyal sons and daughters of Leland Stanford, Sophia Smith, Johns
Hopkins, Lord Jeffrey Amherst and Col. Ephraim Williams, et al., to
demand equal billing. To cool hot potatoes, the post office will not
henceforth immortalize college founders.
   Better news for others. Satchmo may make it because the post
office issues a stamp every year honoring the nation's black
heritage. The outhouse probably won't because, as Rustin says,
stamps are ``the nation's calling cards.'' Irving Berlin probably
will get there, but he's not dead yet. You have to be entombed for
at least 10 years to qualify unless you're a president. They're
eligible one year after their first posthumous birthday.
   ``We believe someone has to stand the test of time,'' Rustin
explains.
   Love has apparently met that standard. The annual ``love'' stamp
sells _S.W.A.K. _ a smashing one billion per issue.
   The advisory committee is, as are the stamps they select, a cross
section. Three are historians. One publishes a graphic arts
magazine. An executive of General Motors is a stamp collector.
Digger Phelps, a collector and Notre Dame basketball coach, is a
member. So is Belmont Fairies, former editor of the canceled
Washington Star, TV executive Jack Rosenthal and Dr. Douglas Lewis,
director of sculpture at the National Art Gallery.
   When the committee meets, Rustin and his staff present the
proposals that have flooded in over the transom from a stamp-minded
citizenry. Each has had a modicum of research. Some proposals are
obvious. Columbus stumbled upon the New World 500 years ago in 1992.
World War II for U.S. involvement will be 50 years old starting in
1991. D-day seems a likely choice. Japanese bombers over Pearl
Harbor don't.
   ``We get into some things controversial,'' says Rustin, ``but we
don't want to reflect badly on the U.S. We don't build a fire that's
not going to warm us.''
   There was a 1981 stamp, for instance, that said ``Alcoholism@You
Can Beat It.'' Would the recipient think there was a hidden message
beyond the one in the envelope?
   The committee's closed door discussions can get heated over
social concerns or a nominee's worthiness. Some proposals have
waited 40 years in the bullpen before making it to stampdom. If the
committee remains undecided, it may ask Rustin for further research.
   Some proposals are accompanied by petitions. ``We neither
encourage nor discourage them,'' says Rustin. The commission allows
no lobbying before it and doesn't credit any proposal.
   ``We don't want to get into who was first.''

   The post office sold about 38 billion stamps last year for
$10,743,000,000. Its employees process through dark of night and
mean dogs about half of the world's postal volume. The majority of
it is metered although there is a trend back to stamps. Business
surveys show people are more apt to open a stamped envelope.
   Three years ago then-Postmaster General Paul Carlin declared
America should beautify its postage. Actually the post office
started getting away from the blue-gray-rose eminences of
Washingtons and Franklins and Jeffersons in the late 1950s with
brighter colors and pleasing graphics. Some think the United States
is closing fast on the consensus world leaders in pretty postage,
Japan and Sweden.
   Stamps divide into definitive and commemorative categories. The
definitives portray national landmarks, human and geographic, and
are the every day stamps for all denominations from a penny to $8.75
for Express Mail, the biggest and most expensive. When they run out,
they are reprinted.
   Commemoratives are one-shot editions of 120 to 160 million
stamps. They honor everything from Navaho blankets to cigar store
Indians, Abigail Adams to Babe Zaharias, blue fin tuna to Boy
Scouts, appaloosa horses to ZlP codes, hot air balloons to certified
public accountants.
   Commemoratives are what the nation's 19 million stamp collectors
stick in their albums. Collectors provided a $157 million profit in
1987 for the post office whose stamps, incidentally, are not tax
supported. By law they pay their way. Since all stamps are changed
every time there is a postal increase, collecting is a growth
industry.
   Collectors like colors, as does the general public, and things
more than people. They are kept coming back by continuing series
such as transportation (iceboats, Stutz Bearcats, pushcarts), blacks
(Sojourner Truth, Roberto Clemente, Scott Joplln) and the arts
(Herman Melville, T.S. Eliot, Enrico Caruso).
   Size restricts what gets on a stamp. What does an artist do about
rivets in a commemorative of the U.S.-Russian space linkup? How do
you reduce an abstract concept like separation of church and state
to the size of a postage stamp? If you can get a social problem on a
stamp, will anyone buy it?
   Take CPAs, not notorious for color or sex appeal. Artist Lou
Nolan created a stunning design last year of an ink penpoint
diagonally intersecting the corner of a ledger sheet. Clever. Pretty.
   Nolan is one of hundreds of artists who design stamps. The
advisory committee has four design coordinators _ one is art
director for the National Geographic Magazine _ who farm out an
approved proposal to three or so artists. The winner gets an average
of $3,000. This is peanuts compared to what a duck stamp designer
can get. The post office atones for its parsimony by giving the
artist what all need and few get, publicity.
   Leafing through the post office guide to its stamps is an amble
through changing times. A Confederate didn't make the postage until
1936 when Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson showed up on a
4-center. A 20-cent postal rider in 1869 was the first non-president
besides Franklin who was famous if for nothing else by making a
profit as colonial postmaster. The rider's horse was the first
non-human. When Columbus, the first foreigner, landed upside down by
printing error in the Bahamas in an 1869 issue, the 14-cent stamp
became an instant rarity now worth some $145,000.
   The famous inverted Jenny on an airmail stamp of 1918 now fetches
some $114,999.76 more than its 24-cent face value. Queen Isabella,
who sent Columbus over here, was the first woman (1893); an unnamed
chief the first Indian (1923); Booker T. Washington the first black
(1940).
   Because perfection is a goal and not a commonplace reality, even
among printers, airplanes can always land upside down on a stamp, to
the delight of collectors and the embarrassment of the post office.
There was an engraver who etched an infinitesimal Star of David in
the beard of a 1986 stamp of Bernard Revel, founder of Yeshiva
University in New York, but he got into a lot of trouble for it.
   Once a stamp has been designed and approved, it goes to the
Bureau of Printing and Engraving. It can come out in rolls, booklets
or panels, all glued by an adhesive that must be approved by the
Food and Drug Administration. (The post office is working on a new
stickum).
   Although it takes up to three years to get a stamp to market,
there's no telling if it will take a licking.
   ``If the public doesn't like a stamp, we know about it,'' Rustin
says. Many people just take what's handed them, but the more
discriminatory _ favorites are history and color _ take pen in hand
and write, stamped, to Washington to express displeasure. The post
office does market surveys, but there's no sure thing in stamps.
There was a 1984 Christmas stamp of a Santa Claus drawn by a
schoolboy, winner of a nationwide competition among young pupils.
Cute as it was, it bombed.
   ``We won't be doing that again,'' says Rustin. Less certain is
what the post office is going to do about Elvis. He's been
officially dead, despite alleged sightings of a postmortem road
show, for more than the requisite decade. He certainly was an
American. And his fandom is clamoring for a Presley stamp. A radio
station in Boston got 10,000signatures on a petition. Rustin figures
he's been on at least 100 radio stations to discuss postalizing the
rock hero.
   The advisory committee, of course, will not be lobbied. Rustin,
their spokesman, firmly bars the door to the committee room.
   ``Some people have trouble with the way he died,'' he says
tactfully.
   And to those who have trouble even believing that Elvis is dead
it can only be reported that the man whose hips set a nation
twisting is, like 30,000 or so of his fellow citizens, national
monuments and assorted memorabilia, ``under consideration.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Four decades and one sexual revolution ago, the
first Kinsey report on sexual behavior burst on a startled American
public. Neither the findings nor the language in which it was
presented would raise many eyebrows today. Meantime the Kinsey
Institute for Sex Research carries on, amid some internal
controversy about aims and purposes.

   Fifty years ago, amid the limestone
bastions and gargoyled turrets of Indiana University, a most
unlikely man with a bow tie and a crew cut began a most unlikely
study _ what goes on behind the bedroom door.
   Ten years later he published the first of two books on American
sexual behavior that shook the American public to its primal roots
and inventoried everything from infidelity to masturbation.
   In retrospect, Alfred C. Kinsey was well suited to bring sexual
behavior out of the confessional in dispassionate scientific terms:
quiet, unassuming, straight, trustworthy, dedicated, a father of
four, a man of specifics, an expert, for instance, in every aspect
of the gall wasp. In 1938, he was asked by a women students'
organization to give a course on love and marriage.
   At the library he was dismayed to discover the lack of valid
information, a sign of the inhibited times. So he began gathering
data himself, interviewing colleagues, students, even the campus
police. People confided in him.
   His reports startled the American people and evoked attacks from
church groups, statisticians and sociologists. The Chicago Tribune
attacked him as a ``real menace to society,'' the Philadelphia
Bulletin killed its own reporter's story. Newspapers from the San
Francisco News to the Raleigh Times, from the Rocky Mountain News to
the London Daily Express either refused to print or edited out
offending passages. In a day when newspapers did not use the words
rape or syphillis, the idea of using explicit references to sexual
activities was unthinkable.
   Kinsey said that if the laws of the land were strictly enforced,
half of all white American males would be in jail as sex offenders;
between 50 and 85 percent of males engage in extramarital sex; by
the age of 40, nearly 40 percent of single males have engaged in
some homosexual activity although they are not homosexuals.
   The 1953 book on women found that 10 percent of married women
never reach climax, but 14 percent of women have multiple orgasms,
up to 20 an hour. Fifty percent of women have had premarital sex and
26 percent of married women had extramarital sex.
   Kinsey's Institute for Sex Research today is headed by a woman,
Dr. June Machover Reinisch, who once took dance lessons to become
the Gwen Verdon of her generation, sang with a group called the
Seagulls, learned to sky dive, earned a pilot's license, helped
manage the romantic soul duo Peaches and Herb and the rock group Sly
and the Family Stone. Later she turned to the study of psychology
and, at age 38, an associate professor at Rutgers, she was offered
the Kinsey job.
   She renamed the center the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex,
Gender and Reproduction, thereby redefining the goals of the
institute.
   ``If we could get back to biology, we'd find that the differences
between the sexes are quite small,'' she once told an interviewer.
``I believe that many of the biological propensities are related to
sensation and perception _how we see things, how we experience them.
Life is a continual interraction ... Eventually, some of the
original differences are highly magnified by experience and by
complicated interactions between organism and environment, while
others are distorted beyond recognition or completely ignored.''
   She also began a thrice-weekly column that appears in some 80 to
100 newspapers, answering questions about sex and reproduction.
   She has named to the board of trustees David Hendin, senior vice
president and editorial director of United Feature Syndicate, and
Sherry Hackett, president of The Ultimate Experience of Beverly
Hills, Calif., which plans to open a new restaurant in Santa Monica.
She is the wife of comedian Buddy Hackett.
   Obviously, they were not named to the board for their expertise
in sex research. Hendin is publisher of the columns, which is both a
source of income and has been called an extension of the Kinsey
Reports in modern dress. Sherry Hackett has a knack for raising
money. She says she raised $250,000 in her last project for the Los
Angeles Suicide Prevention Center and plans to have her first
fund-raiser for Kinsey in the spring.
   For all of this, Reinisch has stirred up a considerable furor,
which some say threatens her job and the reputation of the institute.
   Dr. Paul Gebhard, the former director who remained past
retirement as director emeritus and consultant, resigned Sept. 13
with a pointed letter to Reinisch.
   ``I have become increasingly disappointed in recent years with
the management of the institute,'' he wrote. He congratulated her on
increasing the space the institute occupies in the University's
Morrison Hall and on remodeling the premises.
   But he was critical of what he saw as neglect of the institute's
library, which has been called the world's second-largest repository
of sexual publications, erotica and pornography, the largest being
in the Vatican. He complained that the library staff had been cut,
threatening its value as an up-to-date resource for scientists and
clinicians.
   ``Frankly, it pains me to see journal subscriptions cut and other
austerity measures taken in the library while money is spent on
carpets, drapes, brass lighting fixtures and similar
non-essentials.''

   Reinisch's assistant director, Stephanie Sanders, says the only
money spent on remodeling was earmarked for that purpose by the
university. Reinisch herself says she spent twice as much in 1987 on
the library staff as Gebhard did in his last year and more than four
times as much on library acquisitions. She says the remodeling goes
in part to save the library where materials were endangered by water
leaks. Climate-controlled areas are being readied for the library
volumes, and a gallery is being set up for three-dimensional art.
   Secondly, Gebhard complained, ``in the past six years the
institute has produced very little research.'' He added:
   ``I had hoped that you would attract several competent sex
researchers as institute members or affiliates to undertake various
projects under the aegis of the institute ...Lastly you somehow
missed the one major area of funding for sex research. When the
federal government was seeking grant proposals for survey research
connected with AIDS, numerous applications were received, but I am
told none came from the Kinsey Institute ... the very institute
which became famous for its many survey research projects.''
   Reinisch has pointed out that she serves on an advisory panel for
a national survey, going to 50,000 American households, to better
define the AIDS problem, and has applied for grants to study
pregnant women and their offspring through the first year and a half
of life. Her aims are more toward the biological. Her studies,
including one she had begun earlier involving 9,000 pregnancies and
their issue in Denmark, seek to establish a link between whatever
barbituates and hormones the pregnant women took and the sexual
orientation and gender of their children.
   In addition, her researchers interviewed a group of lesbians and
among other findings discovered that many of them continued to have
heterosexual relations in spite of their self-labels.
   That led Reinisch to suggest that early AIDS research may have
been based on faulty history-taking which could have minimized the
AIDS transmission by heterosexuals.
   Gebhard didn't think much of those projects and with his
resignation severed ``any and all connections with the institute.''
   Earlier Reinisch had asked for and received one year's extension
on a regular five-year university review, the release of which is
now imminent. And over the past year the institute received a spate
of anonymous letters Reinisch characterized as vicious and critical
of her stewardship.
   In mid-year came the abrupt departure of the last three people on
the library staff, reassigned at their request to other campus
libraries.
   That sharply limited the institute library's availability to
scholars, all 64,000 volumes, 3,500 three-dimensional objects and
25,000 pieces of flat art, Japanese, Indian, Persian and Western
drawings and paintings. Beyond that the library houses pornographic
material from cartoons to stag films, fetish objects, prison art,
condoms, letters, diaries, photographs, the fantasies of
generations. Current periodicals stack up with no one to file them.
   What exactly is behind the unrest is unclear. Some say
differences in style and some say shortcomings in substance. There
is no question that there are differences in style.
   Kinsey, who poured every cent of profit from his studies back
into the institute (each hard cover copy of his books yielded a
dollar in royalties, a total of perhaps $500,000) and who pressed
his people to work on Saturdays without overtime, would be
considered old-fashioned in his approach today. When Gebhard first
moved in (in 1946) he had to share a room with Kinsey's gall wasp
specimens, piled in boxes nearly floor-to-ceiling.
   Kinsey was not a fund-raiser. He abhorred the socializing
necessary. What money became available went into expanding the
research base and adding to the collection. Kinsey was a
conservative in every aspect of life except sex research.
   He survived Congressional investigations in the communist-hunting
McCarthy era even when the Rockefeller Foundation, mindful of a
House committee investigation that sought to show that philanthropic
organizations were encouraging research by communists, cut off
further grants to Kinsey's institute.
   In 1957, Kinsey, with the university behind him, faced down U.S.
Customs in the courts over an attempt to stop the import of erotic
materials for research purposes. He did not live to see the landmark
decision. He died in 1956 at the age of 62.
   Kinsey's aim was to build up a reservoir of at least 100,000
personal sex histories. There were some 18,000 when he quit, the
source material for the major studies on American sexual behavior,
and, he hoped, for future studies as well. His notion was to have a
large enough statistical base so that researchers could dip in at
will to retrieve what they needed for any given study.
   Since Kinsey, Masters and Johnson and others have taken the sex
act into the laboratory, measuring scientifically everything from
the physiology of the orgasm to the nature of impotency. Books like
Alex Comfort's ``The Joy of Sex'' are best sellers.
   Both Gebhard and Reinisch had plans to go back to Kinsey's
original subjects and see how things had changed in the past 50
years. It was just too expensive, everyone seems to agree. But the
subjects are still out there, Gebhard and Reinisch agree, between 50
and 80 years of age.
   Reinisch says those she met thought that being interviewed by
Kinsey was one of the greatest experiences in their lives.
``Afterward they felt better about themselves.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Despite what most people think, the American
Public Transit Association recently cited the New York subway system
as the most improved system on the continent and the man in charge
received the manager of the year award. And despite the way the
subway is pictured on TV, filmmakers are having a hard time finding
the once-familiar graffiti sprayed on subway cars. What's going on
in New York's underground?

   Tune in ``The Equalizer'' and see a young girl
stalked by an attacker in a shadowy subway stop. Watch ``Cagney &
Lacey'' chase a suspect through a crowded train, or a video dancer
paint the name of Michael Jackson's album ``Bad'' on the wall of a
Brooklyn station.
   These images of the subway as a filthy bastion of thugs are
powerful. Only 25 percent of Americans surveyed thought the subways
are safe, and only one in three said they would use the underground
when visiting New York.
   But the subway is getting a bad rap, according to Transit
Authority officials. They say determined management and a $12
billion capital improvement program have resulted in a major success
story of the 1980s _ the rebirth of the New York subway system as a
relatively reliable, clean and safe mode of transportation.
   ``The turnaround and the elimination of graffiti from the subway
system has been near miraculous,'' says Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   Officials say subway reliability is five times better than it was
five years ago. Today 94 percent of all cars are clean and free of
graffiti. And less than 3 percent of the city's crimes occur in the
subway, which is used by 3.6 million people daily.
   Plenty of problems remain. Derailments are up after a four-year
decline. The homeless use the subways as dormitories. Beggars harass
passengers. And thieves jam turnstiles and steal tokens.
   And New Yorkers _ half of whom ride the subways daily _ remain
skeptical. A Transit Authority survey found they believe serious
crimes occur in the subway twice as often as they actually do.
   Some notorious crimes have fueled that fear: Bernhard Goetz
gunned down four teen-agers; a violinist's hand was severed when she
was pushed in front of a subway.
   But there is no disputing that the system's decline has finally
been stemmed. Gleaming new stainless steel cars and sturdy
rehabilitated ones painted proud red are rolling across 230 miles of
track that gradually is being replaced.
   The most noticeable change is the eradication of graffiti.
   Four years ago, there was not a single subway car in New York
that was not scarred with spray paint. Graffiti was in vogue at the
time and was considered, in some circles, an art form.
   Transit Authority President David Gunn declared war on graffiti,
ordering cars be cleaned one at a time. If a clean car was sprayed
again, it was removed from service and recleaned. He frustrated
legions of teen-aged spray painters proud of their rolling
``canvases.''
   Gunn is proud of the accomplishment.
   He likes to tell of a recent meeting between TA officials, the
mayor's liaison with the movie and television industry and a group
of major producers who wanted to deface subway cars for filming
purposes.
   ``I said, `No.' They said, `What do you mean, no?' And I said, `I
mean no.' And the car department people were cheering me on,'' Gunn
says.
   ``They said they'd use water colors to mark up the trains and
re-create graffiti and clean up afterward. But we are not going to
let them go in and mark up trains _ re-create the nightmare.
   ``If there is a graffitied train, they can use it. I can't stop
them from taking a picture. If they want to get footage of dirty
subway cars, they'd better hurry up because they aren't going to be
around much longer.''
   Not everyone is convinced that Gunn's approach is best.
   ``He still firmly believes in the cosmetics rather than the
reality of the system,'' says Sonny Hall, president of the Transport
Workers Union. ``He extended the preventative maintenance of the
buses from every 4,000 miles to 8,000 miles, but he won't let a bus
go out if it has gum on the floor, even if that means a gap in
service.''
   Still, the turnaround has made an impression on the American
Public Transit Association, an industry group representing managers
of transit systems in the United States and Canada.
   At a recent meeting in Montreal, the TA was cited as the most
improved system on the continent and Gunn received the manager of
the year award.
   ``The graffiti that had become the TA's international
identification mark has been nearly eliminated,'' says APTA Chairman
Reba Malone, a board member of VIA Transit in San Antonio, Texas.
``The industry looks with pride at the New York City Transit
Authority.''
   But getting the message to the public has proved more difficult.
   The TA now is using sophisticated market research and slick
advertising to change public perceptions.
   ``The image of the New York City transit system is outdated
across the nation,'' says John Linder, director of marketing for the
TA's parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ``But
there is no national advertising for the same reason that there is
no citywide advertising...We're not ready to advertise.''
   Although the system is open 24 hours a day and serves a huge
territory from the Bronx to the Rockaways, not all lines have been
rehabilitated.
   One recent ad campaign promoted six of the system's 26 lines,
three on Manhattan's East Side and three on the West Side that are
consistently rated the best by straphangers.
   The ads urged business riders to use the subways during midday
hours as a speedy alternative to a taxi stalled in traffic.
   The $1 million ad campaign was developed at the mayor's request
to try to ease midtown traffic and air pollution. The MTA considers
it money well spent.
   Some positive exposure is free.
   Michelob and Miller beers both chose the TA's sleek, stainless
steel subways cars as settings for their television commercials.
   The Style section of the Washington Post and Women's Wear Daily,
a fashion trade publication, published this tip: It's hip to ride
the subways.
   And Merrill Lynch, one of the major underwriters of MTA bonds,
produced a glitzy marketing video for potential bond buyers that
glowingly outlines the progress made, most of it financed by the
sale of bonds.
   Merrill Lynch ``wouldn't have touched us with a 10-foot pole five
years ago,'' Gunn says.

   David Gunn oversees the largest subway system in
the world with the enthusiam of a boy playing with a newan't get everything,
especially Japanese food and
fashionable clothes.''
   Itoh marvels at the size of American-grown vegetables, but
doesn't understand the popularity of hamburgers and fast food. He
follows U.S. politics but wonders, ``Can you tell a Democrat from a
Republican?.''
   ``The United States is super, other than its fast food,'' Itoh
says. ``When I brought my daughter home from three weeks at summer
camp with no Japanese food, I promised her a trip to the best sushi
restaurant in Chicago. She said, `No, Daddy, I want a hamburger and
a Coke.'''
   Loneliness can be a problem for people like Katsuhiko Kawasoe,
51, a Diamond-Star executive whose wife and children remained in
Japan.
   ``Sure I miss them,'' Kawasoe says. ``But for the time being,
there are many things to do at work and I play a lot of golf. It's
completely different kind of golf course here. It's so flat, and
it's much cheaper than in Japan.''
   The Japanese find the American educational system much less
demanding than their own. They worry their children will fall behind
upon returning home.
   To shore up perceived weaknesses in the American system, the
state has been spending $120,000 a year since 1986 to pay for a
special school at Illinois State University, operated by the Rev.
Nobukaza Tanaka, 45.
   Every Saturday, 73 Japanese in grades one through nine are
tutored in Japanese language and culture, mathematics, and social
studies.
   ``We focus on the Japanese language because we're afraid the
students might forget their Japanese writing, reading and speaking
skills,'' Tanaka says. ``After three years in the United States,
quite a large number of young people struggle with the language when
they return to Japan.''
   Diamond-Star also hired Todd Imahori, 32, an assistant professor
of communications at Illinois State, to train both its Japanese and
American workers.
   Japanese workers are schooled on body language, told to avoid
crossing their arms during conversations and avoid certain hand
gestures considered offensive in America.
   American workers are taught how to understand English spoken with
a heavy Japanese accent, to interpret common Japanese gestures and
the different Japanese work ethic.
   Imahori teaches the Japanese workers about American work habits
and attitudes, which are geared toward individual achievement and
reward rather than the group-oriented goals common in Japan.
   ``In Japan, if a worker gets behind he voluntarily stays late to
catch up. Here, workers go home at 5 p.m. whether the work is done
or not,'' he says. ``Then there are the family concerns of American
workers, which must be taken into consideration, and holidays.
Religious holidays do not exist in Japan.''
   Besides institutional help provided by schools and the company,
intergration into American life has occurred naturally with the
opening of Kiku, a sushi restaurant, and The Oriental Mart.
   The mart specializes in food for Asians and natives of the
Pacific Islands: spices, canned goods, hugh sacks of rice, frozen
fish, vegetables and all sorts of imported delicacies.
   It was opened in April by four Filipino women who came to the
area to work as quality-control inspectors at a local power plant
construction project in the 1970s. They stayed in the twin-cities
area, Bloomington-Normal, when the job was finished and became
naturalized Americans.
   ``There was a need for an Oriental store in the twin cities and
we were having a hard time finding jobs so we opened the store,''
says Laurita Walaskay, one of the owners.
   There are other signs the two cultural opposites are starting to
mix. The end of each tour of duty by a Japanese technician prompts a
party at a local bar with their American co-workers.
   ``We hate to see them go,'' Mrs. Gardner says. ``We all get
along. There's a mutual respect. And we go out and drink beer
together. I enjoy them and I'm looking forward to training in
Japan.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With its jails already overflowing and arrests
increasing, New York City has been scrambling to find places to
house its prisoners. One solution has been to build new jails and in
some cases this has meant transporting inmates hundreds of miles.
Here's a look at one such prison, which is a far cry from the Big
Apple's Riker's Island.

   Thieves, drug-pushers and other
hoodlums from New York City arrive in this scenic vacation land
aboard chartered jets. They stay in brand-new accommodations,
savoring the bucolic charm of the shore of the St. Lawrence River,
more than 300 miles from the Big Apple.
   They come to go to jail.
   They are men like 37-year-old Alan Foster, who says he has been
in and out of New York City's Riker's Island jail so many times he
has lost count.
   ``I'm not pleased about being so far away from home, but compared
to Riker's Island, this place is all right,'' says Foster, who was
sentenced this time to one year in jail for illegal possession of
stolen credit cards.
   Cape Vincent in upstate New York is now the home of Riverview
Correctional Facility, a 700-bed jail that was built in less than a
year to house criminals from this country's largest city.
   An identical jail was was also built by New York City in
Ogdensburg, about 40 miles to the north. Both opened in August and
were filled in a month.
   ``I don't know what we would have done without the upstate jails.
They opened up just in time,'' says Tom Antenan, a spokesman for the
New York City Department of Correction.
   New York City's jail population has surged to more than 17,000
inmates, largely because of beefed-up drug enforcement, Antenan says.
   He says the city is building more jails in lower Manhattan, on
Staten Island and is considering buying more barges to board
prisoners and adding more cells at Riker's Island.
   The city spent $110 million to build the jails and will pay $40
million a year to operate them under a 10-year contract with the
state Department of Correctional Services.
   H. Otis Radley, a town supervisor in this community of 1,800,
says the jail is providing jobs and should lead to more development,
maybe even a drug store or another gas station.
   ``We've been losing our young people because there's nothing for
them to do here,'' Radley says. ``Working in the prison is a
respectable job that hopefully will keep our young people from
leaving.''
   Critics of the jail, which is located on a main road near a high
school and a state park, included Radley's brother, Jerry, who runs
a trailer park. He and others were afraid it would hurt business.
   ``I wasn't too happy with the idea when it started,'' says Elmer
Gleason, manager of Cedar Point State Park and six other state parks
along the river. ``But now I just hope, once they put some trees in
and do some landscaping, that it will just be a forgotten thing.''
   He says that judging from reactions during the construction of
the prison this summer, the fears that a prison would drive away
tourists probably were unfounded.
   ``People see it as an attraction, just another thing to come and
look at when they're tired of sitting by the river,'' Gleason says.
   Some worry that the prison will change the homey atmosphere of
the community, where car keys are left in ignitions, bicycles are
not locked in garages and people are friendly.
   ``This is really hometown America,'' says Donald Brennan,
principal of Thousand Islands High School. ``If the prison is going
to change things, we hope whatever happens is positive.''
   Brennan says there has been little reaction among the high school
students, even though students pass the facility's fences on the bus
twice a day.
   Inside those fences, guards proudly show off the new washing
machines, the gleaming wood floor in the gymnasium and the walk-in
freezers in the cafeteria.
   Inmates talk about how good the food is, how professional the
guards are and how the toughest adjustment may be getting accustomed
to only being able to watch three channels on television.
   Inmate Foster says that when he stepped off the plane and looked
around he forgot about the whispers onboard of the trip being a
bluff, especially when he saw the shotgun-armed guards greeting him
as he stepped through the doorway.
   ``I didn't know where I was, but I knew wherever it was, we
weren't welcome,'' he said.
   That's the first signal to the prisoners that this jail is not
Riker's Island North.
   ``Most of them are pretty scared when they first look out,'' says
prison guard Pat Leconey. ``Especially when they see us standing
with the shotguns. Usually it takes a few weeks before they get the
New York City attitude back in them.''

   Although Candice Bergen learned comedy on her
father's knee across from Charlie McCarthy, she was frequently cast
as an ice princess.
   ``Look, I was never an obvious choice for comedy,'' she says.
   Now she has her chance. She stars as a television newswoman in
the new CBS series ``Murphy Brown.''
   ``What I love about Murphy is that she's a character part,''
Bergen says. ``She's not a straight leading lady. She has these
edges. She's testy, she has her frailties.''
   The role was not written for Bergen and CBS initially resisted
casting her, yet she has taken to it as though she was born to play
comedy.
   Which she may have been, being the daughter of ventriloquist
Edgar Bergen and being raised in the same household with Charlie
McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd.
   ``My father was this very private, very reserved man who
expressed this very trenchant and often bawdy humor through
Charlie,'' she says. ``He said things through Charlie he could never
say otherwise. I grew up around magic tricks and learning to throw
my voice. He and I would sit together and read cartoons from the New
Yorker and he'd ask me why each one was funny.
   ``I never had much chance to play comedy in films. I was always
cast as the ice princess. I think of my father a lot because we were
very much alike. Our humor is the same. Murphy is similar to Charlie
in that she's fairly fearless and sassy.''
   Bergen told of her growing up with Charlie McCarthy in her
best-selling 1984 biography ``Knock Wood.''
   ``Murphy Brown'' is Bergen's first venture into series
television, and it appears to be a good start. She plays an
anchorwoman on a television magazine show called ``FYI.'' She fits
perfectly into the character, who is the kind of person whose motor
is always running. Murphy is a little overwhelming, and certainly
larger than life. She's talented, bright and sophisticated, yet
ultimately vulnerable.
   Bergen takes chances with the role, as when she bursts into an
off-key rendition of a Motown tune. It's the kind of thing that
could make an actress look foolish, but she uses it as an
opportunity to reveal Murphy's human side.
   ``It's great to have a role you can do something with week after
week,'' she says. ``Our characters just keep growing and expanding.
That's a luxury I've never had before. The more I play Murphy the
more possibilities I find.''
   Her character also breaks new ground on television. The series
opened with Murphy just out of the Betty Ford Clinic, where she had
gone for alcohol addiction. She also gave up smoking during her
stay. It makes the point that people can kick addictions and
function well afterward.
   Bergen notes with some irony that 15 years after she was offered
a job as a correspondent on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' she is now playing
a fictional counterpart.
   ``I love being a journalist,'' she says. ``I've loved and
followed journalism for years, and have done some myself, so I don't
have to research the role. I did a photojournalism series for `The
Today Show.' So it's great to be doing a show with the texture of
network journalism. It's a very savvy show.''
   Her articles and photos have also appeared in a number of
magazines, and in the 1982 movie ``Gandhi'' she was an obvious
choice to play Life magazine photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White.
   In recent years Bergen's career has shifted toward TV movies and
miniseries. It's the kind of career move forced upon many performers
after they pass 40 because of the movies' preoccupation with youth.
She was in the miniseries ``Hollywood Wives'' and such movies as
``Murder: By Reason of Insanity,'' ``Arthur the King'' and
``Mayflower Madam.''
   Bergen, who's married to French director Louis Malle, took time
off for the birth of her daughter, Chloe, three years ago. She's
only recently returned to work.
   Although she studied art history and writing at the University of
Pennsylvania, it seemed inevitable she would go into the family
business. Her cool, blonde, Nordic beauty landed her modeling
assignments while still in college. She made her film debut in 1965
in ``The Group,'' director Sidney Lumet's adaptation of Mary
McCarthy's brittle soap opera tracing the graduates of one of the
Seven Sisters colleges.
   Frequently she was cast in what she calls ``ice princess'' roles,
as in ``Carnal Knowledge,'' ``Oliver's Story,'' and the TV movie
``Mayflower Madam.'' Only rarely was she cast in comedies, such as
``Starting Over'' and ``Rich and Famous.''
   Two of her best roles were in ephe was Steve
McQueen's love interest in ``The Sand Pebbles,'' in which she played
an American woman caught between feuding Chinese warlords in 1926.
McQueen was a cynical saic adventures. Silor aboard the Yangtze River gunboat
USS
San Pablo who comes to her rescue. In ``The Wind and the Lion'' she
was an American woman kidnapped by a Moroccan sheik played by Sean
Connery at his swashbuckling best.

   Long before there was Mrs. Garrett of ``Diff'rent
Strokes'' and ``The Facts of Life,'' there was Mrs. Peachum in ``The
Threepenny Opera'' and Mammy Yokum in ``Li'l Abner'' and even
Mistress Quickly in Shakespeare's ``Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2.''
   Charlotte Rae, actress, singer and comedian, had a thriving
theater career in New York for more than 20 years before she made
her way west to television land.
   Now she has returned to the theater, touring the country in
``Into the Woods,'' the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine fairy tale
musical that goes beyond ``happily ever after.'' Miss Rae and
British singer Cleo Laine are the best-known members of the large
ensemble cast.
   In the show, Miss Rae plays Jack's mother _ of beanstalk fame.
It's a small role _ different and darker than what most people
remember from the original fairy story.
   ``People who know me only from television, from Mrs. Garrett,
they won't believe it's me,'' the actress says. ``I saw this play
last spring on Broadway, and it blew me away. I was dissolved in
tears. The music was so exquisite.
   ``When this opportunity came along to play a small part in a
Sondheim-Lapine musical, I just said to myself, `Oh, God, will you
give me permission? Can I do it?'''
   He apparently said ``yes,'' because after auditioning for
Sondheim and Lapine _ she sang the first act finale from ``The
Threepenny Opera'' and ``Lonely Town'' from Leonard Bernstein's ``On
the Town'' _ Miss Rae got the part.
   ``The hardest thing is trying to learn it all in two weeks before
you open,'' she says. ``It's a true work of art. It's not just a
little jazzy piece. Once you've mastered some of it, you are so
thrilled. I love being bathed in that sound and just being one of
the singers.''
   Miss Rae didn't start out to be a singer. She had intentions of
becoming a serious actress and went to Northwestern University to
major in speech. In her sophomore year, she was waylaid by the
Waa-Mu Show, an annual spring musical starring students at the
school.
   ``I ended up doing all the sketches and a song by Sheldon Harnick
who later wrote `Fiddler on the Roof,''' she says. ``That certainly
widened my range.''
   When Miss Rae graduated, she went straight to New York with all
her theater chums, including Harnick and comedian Paul Lynde. She
rarely was unemployed, landing roles in many important productions,
including the legendary and long-running off-Broadway revival of
``The Threepenny Opera.''
   Miss Rae developed a reputation as a zany singer with a fine
sense of timing, a skill she honed during her stage career in New
York. That work encompassed musicals like ``Li'l Abner,''
``Pickwick'' and ``Three Wishes for Jamie,'' and more serious fare
like Joe Papp's Shakespeare festival in Central Park.
   ``Composers, artists, actors, singers, all of them, I think,
unconsciously learn from others,'' she says. ``I'm sure it's not
conscious, but they can't help it. I know I was influenced by
Beatrice Lillie. I must have been.''
   Eventually she and her family decided to head for Los Angeles.
   ``My former husband wanted to move to California,'' Miss Rae
says. ``He is a music editor and music coordinator. He coordinated
the music for the film version of `Amadeus.'
   ``So many people have moved there from New York, and I felt at
home.''
   Miss Rae found steady work in television, jobs that led to a
recurring role as the housekeeper on ``Diff'rent Strokes'' and then
graduating to headmistress of a girls school on its spinoff, ``The
Facts of Life.'' Her constant employment in television lasted some
10 years before she decided she had had enough.
   ``I wanted to move on and I needed some time for the rest of my
life,'' Miss Rae says. ``I needed time for my family, myself, my
friends.
   ``Television does devour you because you have all sorts of
responsibilities, and I really needed to renew myself,'' she adds.
``I think I owed it to myself. So I honored myself _ and quit. I
think that's a wonderful way to put it.''
   Now Miss Rae has formed a production company to create projects
that will give her opportunities to play roles far removed from Mrs.
Garrett and ``The Facts of Life.'' She's also working on a one-woman
stage show and is interested in re-issuing an album of theater songs
she recorded in the 1950s. Called ``Songs I Taught My Mother,'' the
recording includes rare material by writers such as Harnick, Ogden
Nash, Vernon Duke and Marc Blitzstein.
   ``The songs are all a little on the naughty side but they are fun
because nothing is naughty today,'' she says with a laugh.
   For the moment, Miss Rae will have ``Into the Woods'' to keep her
occupied. But since leaving her television series, she also has
become involved with an international group called Friendship Force.
It promotes the exchange of visitors between different countries,
and Miss Rae is their spokeswoman.
   ``The whole idea is that we are ambassadors of peace on a
personal basis,'' she says. ``We try to understand each other, and
we have developed such a bond. The more people who join, the less
chance there is for conflict if we understand each other.
   ``If all goes well, I'm going to the Soviet Union next year and
stay with a family in a small town. I can't wait.''

   A volcanic dot 1,000 miles out in the Indian
Ocean from Africa, the island-nation of Mauritius is in the midst of
an economic boom. What is being called the ``Mauritius Miracle'' has
turned a backward economy around so drastically that now nearly
everybody works, money is flowing in and ethnic tensions have eased,
at least for now. An AP correspondent who visited the island tells
how it all came about.

<TEXT>
   Just six years ago its
sugar-dominated economy was reeling and 22 percent of its work force
was unemployed, but today this island nation is an economic tiger in
the Indian Ocean.
   Like the nearly suicidal taxi drivers on its narrow roads,
Mauritius has hurtled from Third World low-income economic status to
a middle-income nation where practically everybody has a job and the
money is pouring in from tourists flocking to its beaches and new
industry implanted by foreign investment, chiefly from Asia.
   Some call it the ``Mauritius Miracle,'' but the prime minister,
Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, won't have it.
   ``There is no miracle,'' he said. ``It is due simply to hard
work, discipline and will.''
   _Real growth has averaged 7 percent since 1983, largely as a
result of the foreign investiment aggressively sought by the
government.
   _Unemployment has declined to just under 4 percent, virtual full
employment, with jobs in some sectors going begging. From 1985 to
1987, 20,000 new jobs were created each year in manufacturing alone
among the island's 1 million people and it has replaced sugar as the
main industry.
   _Annual per capita income is estimated at $2,000 _ up from $1,000
six years ago _ on the 720-square-mile, pear-shaped volcanic island
500 miles east of Madagascar and 1,000 miles east of the African
mainland.
   _Earnings from tourists drawn to Mauritius' beaches doubled
during the same period, and excellent sugar harvests have further
fueled the boom.
   The chief opposition leader, Prem Nababsing, acknowledges: ``It
is a fact that there has been great progress. We have had a good
program from the government side on investments.''
   Jugnauth, in an interview, cautioned, however, that the success
could disappear as quickly as it came ``and that is why I always
call upon our people to be reasonable, to be fair and not to think
that we have already achieved success for eternity.''
   The government is working on setting up an offshore banking
center and stock exchange. It hopes to replace South Africa as a
regional center for international companies and to become a stepping
stone for Asian firms interested in Africa.
   The growth rate has already begun to slow down, which is just
what the country needs, said Finance Minister Vishnu Lutchmerenaidoo.
   He said ``inflation is soaring,'' rising from less than 1 percent
to 15 percent in the past year, and the country is seriously short
of skilled labor.
   Slower growth will give Mauritius time to work on curbing
pollution, improving the quality of life and training workers for
more specialized jobs. The goal is to shift from the manufacture of
knitted woolen garments, its chief export, to electronics and other
higher-price items.
   A quality-of-life department has been set up, financed by liquor
and cigarette taxes, and it plans exercise and health-food campaigns
and a nationwide anti-smoking program.
   Large amounts will be spent on environmental programs.
   ``We are very much aware that if the present growth rate is
maintained and corrective measures are not taken we are heading
toward a dirty Mauritius, a rich and dirty Mauritius,'' said Finance
Minister Lutchmerenaidoo.
   There's much to save.
   Graceful mountains rise dramatically above the cane fields,
appearing higher than their altitudes. Piton de la Rivere Noire is
the highest at 2,711 feet.
   Buddhist pagodas, Hindu shivalas, Tamil temples, Moslem mosques
and Christian cathedrals dot the landscape on an island that Mark
Twain said ``was created before paradise came into being and served
as a model for the latter.''
   But slowing down the economy further isn't easy, Lutchmeenaraidoo
said. Investment is continuing _ more than 1,500 hotel rooms are
under construction and the government recently approved a 15-percent
increase in the minimum wage to $10.35 a week for employees working
in manufacturing. However, with labor in demand most workers are
paid far above the minimum.
   ``We're buying social peace,'' Lutchmerenaidoo said. ``If people
don't believe in what you are doing they won't follow you.''
   There is no sign of complacency among government officials or
businessmen. ``We cannot afford to sit on our backsides,'' said
Danielle Wong, manager of the Mauritius Export Processing Zone.
   Speaking to a group of African businessmen and women at a seminar
on the Mauritius economic boom, she said protectionism and
competition from other developing countries meant there was no time
for relaxing.
   Delegates from half a dozen East African countries were clearly
impressed, several noting their governments had endorsed similar
export efforts but done nothing.
   Ondiek Okelo of the Kenya Trade Promotion Center said, ``This is
where it has happened. This is a great success story. We've have
been very impressed.''

   Export manager Wong, asked by delegates if the government
consults with industry before levying new taxes, responded: ``Of
course. They come to us to talk and if they are proposing taxes that
are too high, we say you are going to blow up the economy and you
will be kicked out of government.''
   The export zone's more than 500 businesses employ more than
90,000 people.
   This courtship of government and industry began after the 1982
elections, which themselves serve as a guide to Mauritius. Jokes
were made during that election about the economy being as dead as
the Dodo bird, which became extinct after Dutch hunters here wiped
them out several centuries ago.
   An alliance led by the Jugnauth's Mauritian Militant Movement
(MMM) defeated the pro-Western government, taking all 60 elected
seats. But Jugnauth's government immediately began implementing the
suggestions of Western creditors.
   While Jugnauth's government was slashing corporate taxes and
removing duties on many items to entice investors in the export
zone, the island also benefited from an improved world economy,
lower petroleum prices and an absence of cyclones during the sugar
season. But most important was a big influx of money from Hong Kong
and other Asian nations.
   Some of these countries had already reached their export quotas
with Western nations and shifted production to Mauritius.
   Meanwhile, Jugnauth was expelled from the MMM leadership and
forced to form his own party a year after winning the election. His
new party, the Mauritian Socialist Movement, has led an alliance
that has won two subsequent elections.
   Jugnauth's alliance controls two-thirds of the seats in
Parliament, although it won only 9,512 votes more than the
opposition in last year's election in which 89 percent of the
electorate cast ballots.
   In Mauritius terms, this is political stability and both
opposition leader Nababsing, who is with the MMM, and Finance
Minister Lutchmeenaraido credit it with a big role in the country's
economic development.
   ``I don't see any other party changing what we are doing,'' said
Lutchmeenaraido.
   Rather than proposing major changes in the liberal economic
reforms, Nababsing says, it was his party, the former party of the
prime minister, that initiated them.
   Nababsing does criticize the government, saying it has been too
slow to diversify, and that growth is slowing, inflation is out of
control and more attention needs to be paid to avoiding ethnic
divisions.
   Since independence from Britain in 1968, governments have been
careful to avoid fanning ethnic divisions among various groups in
the Hindu majority or other groups.
   Two-thirds of the population are Hindus, many of them descendants
of indentured laborers brought here by the British to work the sugar
planations.
   About 28 percent are Creoles, descendants of Africans and
Europeans or Africans and Asians. About 3 percent are of Chinese
descent and the rest descendants of French or other European stock.
   English is the official language but Creole, a mixture of French
and other languages, along with French are spoken by the vast
majority.
   Road signs are in English but advertisements and newspapers are
in French.
   French and Creole had already been entrenched before the English
captured the island from France in the 19th century. Before the
French, the Dutch occupied the island from 1598 to 1710.

   Prime Minister Sir Aneerood Jugnauth
has surprised all those _ both friends and foes _ who viewed him as
just a figurehead when he took office six years ago.
   Far from resting on the ceremony of his office, Jugnauth has
presided over an unprecedented economic boom for his island nation,
surmounted several politicial crises and scandals, and narrowly
escaped assassination Nov. 6.
   No one sees him as a figurehead now.
   ``Since 1983 I had to follow a tough line, inculcate discipline
at all levels, especially among the working class,'' the
58-yeara-old leader said in an interview. ``I had to assure
industrial and social stability. Of course coupled with political
stability, which brought in the confidence required on the part of
investors to come here.''
   He added, ``I must say I have had lots of problems since I
started, but I think I have a strength in that I am sincere in what
I am doing. I believe that our country has a great future. I have
always believed that we are destined to play an important role in
this region, especially economically, and I have always had the will
to pull on.
   ``Unlike many other politicians I don't mind even if I have to
take unpopular measures in the interest of the country to do it.''
   When he took office, many felt Jugnauth was chosen solely because
he was a Hindu, and Hindus make up two-thirds of the island's 1
million people.
   Nevertheless, it was during a Hindu religious service Nov. 6 that
a Hindu priest was disarmed as he held a gun to Jugnauth's head.
   The motives of the alleged assailant, who is facing charges of
attempted murder, remain unclear.
   Jugnauth said, ``I must tell you that since 1983, wherever I go,
I always have the apprehension that something may happen to me some
day. I am exposed. The risk is always there.
   ``But I was a bit shocked because I never thought in the place
were I was, surrounded by the kind of people I was surrounded by, in
whom I have 100 percent trust, that they would never do anything to
harm me and the danger came from that source, from that quarter.
This is what shocked me.''
   But many Mauritians still see the prime minister as a prime mover.
   Said Finance Minister Vishnu Lutchmeenaraido: ``The world today
acknowledges the fact we are a progressive country, wedded to the
ideals of democracy and secularism. Much of the credit of the
gigantic economic and industrial development of recent times ...
goes to the prime minister.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Mauritius:
   THE LAND _ The island is almost completely surrounded by a coral
reef and several mountains rise dramatically with the highest
reaching 2,711 feet. Sugar cane fields cover 87 percent of the
arable land. In the southwestern Indian Ocean, 500 miles east of
Madagascar and 1,000 miles off the east coast of Africa, the
volcanic island covers 720 square miles, about half the size of
Rhode Island. The territory of Rodgrigues and other islands under
its control brings the total area to 788 square miles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Although visited by Arab and Portuguese sailors, the
island was uninhabited the Dutch occupied it in 1598 and named it
Maurtius after their stadholder, Maurice of Nassau. France claimed
the island after the Dutch abandoned their settlement and imported
African slaves to work the sugar plantations. Britain took the
island in 1810, largely to stop attacks by pirates based on the
island, and thousands of Indian laborers were brought in to work the
fields after slaves were freed. Agitation for political
representation began in the 1930s and in 1947 limited self-rule was
granted. Progress towards independence was delayed by the opposition
of some Creole groups, who feared domination by the Indian majority.
In 1968 the island became independent with a conservative Hindu, Sir
Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, as its first prime minister.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ All are immigrants or descendants of immigrants.
Two-thirds of the population of 1 million are of Indian descent
while 29 percent are Creoles of mixed African and European or Indian
and European descent. About 3 percent are of Chinese ancestry and
about 36,000 are of European descent, mostly French. About 56
percent belong to various Hindu sects, and about 28 percent are
Christian, mostly Roman Catholics. About 16 percent are Moslems.
English is the official language, but Creole, an admixture of pidgin
French and other languages, is the lingua franca.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The economy was almost totally dependent on sugar
until an aggressive export-oriented economic program was inititated
in 1983. While sugar was king the economy was on a boom or bust
cycle. Cyclones and world sugar prices dictated the island's
fortunes. In recent years, after the implementation of an export
program, under which taxes and duties were slashed to encourage
investment, manufacturing, particularly of clothes, quickly
surpassed sugar. Tourism has become a major money earner.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Oliver and Company,'' ``The Land Before Time''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   G-rated movies have become as scarce as truth in presidential
elections, so it is heartening to find two on the holiday bill of
fare. Both are animated features. Both can be enjoyed by teen-agers
and adults as well as small fry.
   ``Oliver and Company'' is the most fully realized animated film
from the Disney Co. since ``101 Dalmatians.'' It is inspired
entertainment in all departments: characters, animation, comedy,
plot and voices. It should be another perennial for Disney.
   The story is loosely based on Dickens' ``Oliver Twist'' _ very
loosely. The locale is Manhattan, not London. Fagin is a nerdish
petty crook, not a criminal mastermind. And his youthful charges are
a ragtag bunch of dogs, not cockney urchins.
   The newcomer to the gang is Oliver, a spunky kitten who failed to
get adopted from a street corner carboard box. He is befriended by
the roguish Dodger urch officials say Mass would be celebrated in the Church
of
the Nativity as usual this year, but no decision had been made on
whether the Latin patriarch will lead a religious procession in
Manger Square.
   The uprising has left its mark on this half Moslem, half
Christian town of 50,000 four miles south of Jerusalem. Shops were
closed Monday and streets deserted during a general strike ordered
by the underground leadership of the revolt.
   Israeli soldiers with machine guns patrolled the main highway
into town and guarded Manger Square from two rooftop lookout posts.
Five soldiers were in the square, eating a lunch of sandwiches and
oranges.
   A few tourist buses were parked to the Church of the Nativity,
but as many as 50 at a time squeezed into the square before the
uprising.
   Visitors were taken through the church quickly Monday, then back
to the buses, and some were disppointed. ``It's a shame that the
shops are closed,'' said Jill Parker, 24, of Britain.
   Salvador Bandak, 56, whose souvenir shop was closed for the
strike, said the rebellion had ruined his business. ``In two weeks,
I sell one dollar's worth of goods,'' he said.
   Others in the tourism industry, Bethlehem's main business, have
similar problems.
   Michel Kreiten, manager of the 60-bed Star Hotel, said only four
of his rooms were reserved for Christmas. Bethlehem hotels are
accustomed to full bookings months in advance of Christmas.
   Nasser, the deputy mayor, said the town council decided to cancel
official celebrations in support of the uprising. No formal vote was
taken but the decision was unanimous, he said.
   Some Christians in Bethlehem said they would support the decision
and restrain private holiday observances.
   ``I won't have a tree this year and people in my family are not
going to exchange presents,'' Kreiten said. ``I don't think anyone
will celebrate.''
   Rachel Elian, a 48-year-old housewife, said: ``I'm not going to
bake cookies and sweets. My friend's son is in prison. How could I
tell her ``Merry Christmas'' and her son is not at home?''
   Her husband, Robert, disagreed. He said Christians are becoming a
beleaguered minority in Bethlehem and should assert themselves by
celebrating Christmas.
   ``All year we've had days of sorrow,'' he said. ``We need a day
to smile.'' Bethlehem's plans for the season were not welcome news
to tourists. ``I don't think it's a good idea,'' said Reinhard
Steffen, a 24-year-old West German. ``One should keep the old
traditions.''

   Videos Reviewed this week: ``Three Men and a Baby,'' ``Tokyo
Pop'' and ``The Seventh Sign.''
   
   ``Three Men and a Baby'' (Touchstone Home Video; VHS-Beta,
$89.95; Rated PG)
   
   There have been far funnier movies in the past couple of years
than ``Three Men and a Baby'' but none that have made as much money
_ a phenomenal $167 million at last count.
   Any film that successful has to have something going for it. In
this case it's one awfully cute baby (played by 5-month-old twins
Lisa and Michelle Blair) and three awfully cute grown men _ Tom
``Magnum P.I.'' Selleck, Ted ``Cheers'' Danson and Steve Guttenberg
of ``Diner,'' ``Cocoon'' ``Police Academy'' and other movies.
   In this adaptation of the French comedy ``Three Men and a
Cradle,'' the men play well-to-do bachelors whose carefree, romantic
life on Manhattan's Upper West Side is rudely interrupted by the
arrival on their doorstep of a baby girl. It seems Danson, who plays
an irresponsible, not-too-bright actor, is the father, and the
mother is a struggling actress who temporarily just can't cope with
both motherhood and a career.
   At first the guys are horrified, but gradually they learn to
bathe the baby, change her diapers, hold her when she cries _ and,
finally, to love her and want to keep her. This makes for some
good-natured fun, needlessly complicated by a subplot involving drug
dealers whose smuggled heroin has been dropped off in the bachelor
pad.
   Selleck, whose previous film roles as a romantic swashbuckler
left audiences cold, is appealing in a low-key way; Danson is more
or less the same egotistical clod he plays on television; Guttenberg
comes across as the most genuine of the three.
   The movie was directed by Leonard Nimoy, Mr. Spock of ``Star
Trek'' fame. His style is efficient but unimaginative, perhaps in
keeping with his television roots.

   ``Tokyo Pop'' (Warner Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   ``Tokyo Pop'' is a fairly routine story of young love, dressed up
in punk clothes and shipped off to Japan. Still, it's charming and
fun.
   Wendy (Carrie Hamilton) yearns to move from backup singer to lead
in New York City's downtown music scene. Down on her luck, she gets
a post card from a friend in Tokyo, and decides to join her.
   Hiro (Yutaka Tadokoro of the Japanese band Red Warriors),
meanwhile, is a very westernized Tokyo rocker, singing ``Blue Suede
Shoes'' in a band whose members are convinced they will make it big
if only they can find a gaijin, or foreigner, to sing with them.
   You can guess most of the rest of director Fran Rubel Kuzui's
film, though there are twists along the way to Wendy's becoming lead
singer in Hiro's band.
   For all its rebellious appearance, ``Tokyo Pop'' is moralistic.
There are no drugs, and the characters drink only moderately. Wendy
and Hiro do wind up in bed, but there's no promiscuity. What the
kids in the movie want is a straight version of success and
happiness.
   The small touches of the movie give it its charm. Wendy, finding
her friend has gone to Thailand, spends her first night in Tokyo in
an inn called Mickey House and lavishly overdecorated with Mickey
Mouse paraphernalia. Scenes of young Japanese imitating Western
rockers in a park are fun, as are other signs of the mix of East and
West in modern Tokyo.
   But the movie misses its chance to explore deeply the inevitable
culture clash between Wendy and Hiro, and instead relies on repeated
laments of ``you wouldn't understand'' and focuses on their common
troubles.
   The movie is partly in Japanese, with subtitles.
   Hamilton and Tadokoro are quirky, energetic and engaging and keep
``Tokyo Pop'' from being merely the kind of fluff Wendy complains
about having to sing.

   ``The Seventh Sign'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Video; VHS-Beta
$89.95; Rated R)
   
   God has just about had it up to here with humanity, and anybody
who rents this hokey bit of dreck about a modern-day biblical
apocalypse will understand why. It's a miracle director Carl Schultz
wasn't struck by a bolt of lightning.
   We know the world's up the proverbial creek without a paddle
because God's pock-marked messenger (Jurgen Prochnow) is making all
these nasty things happen.
   It's snowing in the Israeli desert; a Nicaraguan river runs
bloody; there are all these dead fish off the Haitian coast, and
let's not forget the rotten weather they're having in Southern
California, what with golf ball-sized hail, hurricane-force winds
and earthquakes.
   Naturally, the only person who can deliver the world from God's
wrath is a pregnant yuppie, played by Demi Moore with all the
passion and perception that has marked her many other unforgettable
performances.
   The seventh sign has to do with Demi's baby; when it's born, dead
and souless, that's all, folks. Unless Demi can come up with a
miracle.
   Cripes, are we in trouble, or what?
   If you can hang on that long _ that in itself would be a miracle
_ there's a hilarious scene at the end where Demi goes through the
shortest labor in history while bleeding profusely from a major
bullet wound during an earthquake that would have caused California
to drop into the ocean.
   Don't bother.

   ``Back by Popular Demand'' (Mercury) _ Kurtis Blow
   
   Rapper Kurtis Blow wants you to know _ he's back. And, lest you
forget it, five of the 10 songs on ``Back by Popular Demand'' deal
with that fact.
   Blow's ego exercises on his latest album would be easy to fault
if he didn't pull them off with such good humor, wit and some of the
hottest music around.
   One of the original rap music stars, he took a self-imposed break
from recording in 1986. As he raps in ``Still on the Scene,'' some
of that time was spent ``watching cable, with my feet on the table,
collecting royalties from my record label.''
   But he had to come back, y'see, because he's The King.
   Blow's got ``the answer for every dancer,'' he says in the title
cut. And, as he defends himself against the critics and rap upstarts
in ``I'm True to This'': ``I'm not new to this, I'm true to this.''
   Then, in ``Get on Up,'' he says: ``Every bit of me- is the
epitome- of rappin' excellence.''
   Get the picture?
   You kind of wish he would have crammed the attitudinizing into
maybe two or three songs, though, because Blow really connects when
he tackles other subjects.
   In ``Only the Strong Survive,'' for example, he paints a stark
picture of crack devastation. The song opens with an ambulance
dispatcher working the death of a 19-year-old. Later in the song, he
graphically details the rise and fall of a young basketball prodigy
who eventually drops dead on the court: ``Bobby had problems- and
the fans could tell- cos he used to play the game so well.''
   With the exception of ``Blue Iguana,'' a tropical-flavored dud,
the music burns. The percussion, by Jorge Bermudez and Willie Loya,
is especially sharp and direct.
   Turn it up! Listen closely! Start dancing! Do it now!

   ``Let It Roll'' (Warner Bros.) _ Little Feat
   
   In music, as well as politics, preconceptions are important.
   No one brought great expectations to the release of a new Little
Feat album in 1988, much like a droning public speaker anticipates a
mediocre debate performance. After all, the influential 1970s band
disintegrated more than a decade ago and former leader Lowell George
is long since dead.
   So it's a surprise that the reformed Little Feat's new record,
``Let It Roll,'' contains some bracing music. The title cut, ``Hate
to Lose Your Lovin,''' and ``One Clear Moment'' are all crackling
good tunes, briskly-paced funk rock with powerful hooks.
   That alone is enough to make ``Let It Roll'' a success to most
listeners _ it's already exceeded expectations.
   But this is a shallow album; the quality drops off precipitously
after the three successes. ``Hanging on to the Good Times'' and
``Listen to Your Heart'' hearken back to the colorless days of
California rock, the former an insufferable tale of middle-aged
rockers reminiscing about all-night parties.
   The aptly-titled ``Business As Usual'' comments on world affairs
with this insightful passage: ``Came home last night, wishin' I
could unwind. Turned on the news, you know it blew my mind.''
   The song eventually becomes an attack on two easy targets _
television evangelists and the press. Unless those attacks can be
done imaginatively, like Don Henley's ``Dirty Laundry,'' they're
nothing but a bore.
   Little Feat's members are exceptional musicians, and they enlist
vocal help from such pros as Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt and Bob
Seger. But their music lacks the consistent inspiration that sets
some musicians, as well as politicians, apart from the crowd.

   ``New Jersey'' (Mercury) _ Bon Jovi
   
   Many Bon Jovi fans say the best thing about the group is singer
Jon Bon Jovi's hair. It doesn't appear he's had it cut since the
release of the band's last album, ``Slippery When Wet,'' which has
sold 13 million copies. So ``New Jersey'' is likely to be another
hit, even though Jon's long locks can't be heard on the record.
   What can be heard are ripoffs of Bruce Springsteen, the most
blatant being the ``Hungry Heart''-ish ``Born to be My Baby.'' On
the next cut, ``Living in Sin,'' Jon mimics the harmony vocals of
Steven Van Zandt, who used to be in Springsteen's band. And then
there's ``Blood on Blood,'' an unintentional parody of the Boss's
narrative epics.
   Bon Jovi shows it has varied tastes by stealing three or four
Aerosmith guitar riffs for ``Homebound Train.''
   ``New Jersey'' contains flashes of originality and humor. The Top
10 hit, ``Bad Medicine,'' is good fun, with clever lyrics and an
anthemic chorus. Two strong cuts close the record _ ``99 in the
Shade,'' a summertime party boogie tune, and ``Love for Sale,'' an
acoustic bluesy shuffle.
   But the other 45 minutes of music is mostly loud, obnoxious,
arrogant and dumb. Those ingredients sometimes make for great rock
records, but ``New Jersey'' is too derivative to be one.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Don't Give Mandy Patinkin Any Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During a career that has taken him from
Broadway to Hollywood and back again, Mandy Patinkin has heard
enough advice for a dozen careers. Now he's turning off.
   ``I don't mean to be offensive to anybody who has the rules,'' he
said during a visit from his New York headquarters. ``For so long I
tried to follow the rules and I was getting sicker and sicker and
sicker, because none of them was working for me.
   ``I don't know ... what's right, what kind of parts you're
supposed to take, whether to put makeup on your face so people can't
see you; you do a play or you don't do a play; you do a movie for
this reason or you don't.
   ``I don't want to hear about it anymore. I want to be left alone,
just go out and do my work. You could go nuts with theories about
how to do it all.''
   Whatever Patinkin is doing, it seems to be working. He has been
acclaimed for his stage roles as Che Guevara in ``Evita'' and as
Georges Seurat in ``Sunday in the Park With George.'' He has also
made an impression in such films as ``Ragtime,'' ``Yentl,''
``Daniel,'' ``Maxie'' and ``The Princess Bride.''
   Now, he's trying something a little different. He's a spaceling
in ``Alien Nations,'' tracking down a murderous crew of drug dealers
in partnership with cop James Caan. Patinkin is part of a group of
immigrants who have been subjugated by drugs on another planet.
   ``I loved the character of George,'' said Patinkin. ``He is far
more human than the humans. What I loved about the script was the
speech that he gave to Jimmy about how you humans don't live up to
the standards that you set for yourselves. He thinks the human race
is an extraordinary species and he doesn't understand why they have
so many problems in such a beautiful place.''
   The actor admitted that he became entranced with makeup ever
since he saw photos of Dick Smith converting Dustin Hoffman into an
old codger for ``Little Big Man.'' The idea of adopting the guise of
a space creature was one of the lures for ``Alien Nation.'' But the
lure turned into ``a nightmare.''
   ``When we did the tests, it was five-six hours in the chair, and
then 20-30 minutes in front of the camera,'' he said. ``Then the
makeup came off when I dipped my head in the Dow chemical vat.
   ``On the first day of shooting, I was in the makeup chair for
four-five hours, then I was on the set for 13 hours. And I panicked.
   ``I was absolutely going out of my mind. I had air-conditioning
hoses going up my arms. I was absolutely encased in rubber, so my
body temperature was about 110. Except for the whites of my eyes,
there wasn't a pore open.
   ``You get claustrophobic and you panic. I was also thinking: four
months of this, I'm not going to make it. Get the lawyers. Sue me.
I'm out of here. Then I thought: I don't want that kind of hassle in
the business; I'm going to die soon anyway.''
   He was out sick for a few days, and he was more relaxed when he
returned. Caan helped out by entertaining with songs and jokes while
Patinkin was in the makeup chair. Caan's name for his alien co-star:
Mr. Potatohead.
   Though one of the theater's authentic stars, Patinkin would
nonetheless like to be making more films.
   ``I like working in New York because my family is there, and I
want to be near my kids,'' he said. ``But I also love making movies,
and I like the fact that they reach such a large audience. That's a
plus, though there's nothing like being on the boards with that
crowd right there doing the play with you. I'd never give that up.
   ``I always knew that the stage was the first thing I was going to
do. Because when I was 15, I started in the community theater (in
Chicago). That's what I did in New York first, but I always dreamed
of being in the movies. And I still dream of being in the movies.
I'm no difference from anyone else. Everyone dreams of being in the
movies.''

<HEAD>The Artists: A Conductor of the World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conductor Jesus Lopez-Cobos thinks of home as
Berlin, Madrid and Cincinnati.
   ``I never go to a hotel. Every place, when we arrive, I say,
`We're home,''' said the 48-year-old music director of the
Cincinnati Symphony.
   Lopez-Cobos also is general music director of the Berlin Opera
and music director of the Spanish National Orchestra. He recently
was appointed music director of the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra in
Switzerland, effective in the fall of 1990, the year his contract
ends in Berlin.
   This season he conducts more than three months in Cincinnati. In
Berlin, he'll conduct nine operas, including Wagner's ``Ring''
cycle, which he will bring to the Kennedy Center of the Performing
Arts in June.
   ``Seventeen years in Berlin I think is enough,'' Lopez-Cobos
said. ``The repertory system is very, very hard work. You have to
switch from one opera to the next. You can not go only to do a new
production and then disappear. I have to conduct everything.
   ``I knew before I accepted Cincinnati that in '90 I would finish
Berlin. I knew the first three years would be difficult, then I
would have more time. I have decided that's my last opera house to
run. It is not like before when singers stayed. They want to guest
everywhere. We have terrible problems to make the repertory,'' he
said.
   ``For a European conductor, it is so pleasant to be with one
normal American orchestra. I couldn't say no.''
   Lopez-Cobos has a doctorate in philosophy from the University of
Madrid. The subject has helped his conducting, he says. ``Every
composer is a child of his time, of the mentality of his time. Most
of them had relationships with philosophers. I think it is good if
you have an idea of what was happening at the time of a composer's
life.
   ``I think specializing is a very bad thing. I hear, `He is a very
good Mozart conductor.' I think, `He is already limited.' The more
you know about differences between composers and their orchestral
colors, the more you can use it in your work for other things.''
   Lopez-Cobos, whose second wife died of cancer more than two years
ago, is married to Cuba-born, America-educated lawyer Alicia Ferrer,
whom he met in Switzerland. He has two sons, Jesus, 19, and Manuel,
8, who live with relatives in Madrid.
   The conductor was born in Toro, Spain, in February 1940, during a
time of celebration at the end of the Spanish Civil War. His parents
named him Jesus, he says, ``because they thought I was a gift of
heaven. And Jesus is a very common name in Spain.
   ``I took a long time to decide between philosophy and music. My
father was in the Wagner Society when he was in Madrid as a young
man. He was interested in German culture, philosophy and music. I
heard music at home.
   ``As a student in Spain I conducted chorales. I was always
interested in singing and the 16th and 17th century music of Spain.''
   After getting his degree he went to Vienna to study conducting.
``I'm a little bit fatalistic. There were two well-known conducting
competitions, in Copenhagen and Besancon, France.''
   He entered, won third prize in Copenhagen in 1968 and first in
France in 1969. ``This encouraged me to try (to become a conductor).
We know the chances in Spain are almost zero. I knew I have to try
outside Spain, which is always more difficult than in your own
country,'' he said.
   The first orchestra he conducted was the Youth Prague
Philharmonic. Then, after spending the 1969-70 year at the Juilliard
School, Lopez-Cobos went to Italy.
   ``I knew Peter Maag, a Swiss conductor. I assisted him in some
operas. In Venice he got sick and I had to conduct for him,'' he
said. It was ``The Magic Flute,'' his opera-conducting debut, in
1970. Lopez-Cobos was 30.
   ``That was my chance,'' he said. ``I stayed almost a year in
Venice, until I came to Berlin. In 1971, Lorin Maazel resigned from
the Berlin Opera to take the Cleveland Orchestra. They decided to
take three or four young conductors instead of a music director. I
was invited for three performances. At the break (intermission) in
the first, they offered me a four-year contract. I was unsure. My
friends in Vienna said, `Go.''' He has been music director since
1981.
   His U.S. conducting debut was in 1972 in a performance of ``Lucia
di Lammermoor,'' starring Beverly Sills at the San Francisco Opera.
   In 1986, Lopez-Cobos followed Michael Gielen, who moved to the
Baden-Baden Radio Symphony in Germany, as music director of the
Cincinnati Symphony.
   Lopez-Cobos also has a recording project with Telarc Records.
   ``My Cincinnati contract is to 1991,'' he said. ``Probably I will
come with my family to America, find a house and from here go to
Europe.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: New Alter Ego for Harrison, Dylan, et al.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The true legend of the Traveling Wilburys
began when George Har..., er, Nelson Wilbury needed to record an
extra song at short notice and invited two of his dinner companions
to lend their voices.
   Nine days and 10 songs later, the result was one of those happy
accidents that proves there's more to the music business than
accountants and estates.
   You won't find the names George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison,
Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne on ``Volume One,'' the debut album by the
oddly-named Traveling Wilburys. But the dark glasses and pseudonyms
can't hide those familiar talents.
   ``We definitely didn't want to treat this like a supergroup,''
said Petty, or Charles T. Wilbury Jr. ``I don't even like the term
all that much. But we were aware that it would be viewed as such. We
look at the Wilburys as a completely other persona as ourselves.''
   Harrison mentioned to Lynne and Orbison over dinner last spring
that he needed a new B-side for a 12-inch single release. The other
two said they'd help him put together a song.
   The former Beatle had to retrieve his guitar, which he'd left at
Petty's California house during a visit a few days earlier, Petty
said. The lead Heartbreaker was also asked to join in on the record.
   Since all the nearby studios were booked, the three amigos had to
impose on another friend who had recording facilities in his house.
Dylan said he'd be glad to offer his assistance.
   ``We all sat around the grass at Bob's house and wrote this song
called `Handle With Care' and recorded it that night,'' Petty
recalled. ``When it was all done it sounded really good.''
   Much too good, they thought, for a B-side. So they kept on
writing and recording.
   ``It was a very innocent thing, really,'' Petty said. ``We were
just kind of enjoying it and we were deep into it before we realized
almost what we were doing.''
   That spontaneity, and a lot of humor, comes through on the
record. ``Volume One'' sounds like a group of friends, albeit
extremely talented friends, enjoying themselves together. All five
trade lead and backing vocals and strum guitars.
   The results are a cross between Harrison's early '70s solo work
and the electronic flourishes Lynne brought to the Electric Light
Orchestra. Orbison's ``Not Alone Any More'' is in the vein he's
mined for a quarter-century and the three songs Dylan dominates are
some of his best work in years.
   The song ``Dirty World'' pokes fun at Prince with a series of
sexual double-entendres and the wickedly funny ``Tweeter and the
Monkey Man'' is littered with Bruce Springsteen references.
   The record was a true collaboration, Petty said. On ``Tweeter,''
for instance, he and Dylan spoke lyrics into a tape recorder then
edited them into a story. Other Wilburys added the chorus, he said.
   Credit a non-rocker, Prince Charles of Great Britain, with the
name Traveling Wilburys, Petty said.
   Harrison and Lynne performed at the Prince's Trust concert last
year and were complimented by the host following the show, he said.
The prince said the two should form a band, and when they asked for
a name, he suggested the Traveling Wilburys, Petty said.
   The quintet quickly adopted the persona. Harrison is identified
throughout as Nelson Wilbury, Lynne is Otis Wilbury, Orbison is
Lefty Wilbury and Dylan's called Lucky.
   The whimsical liner notes explain that ``the original Wilburys
were a stationary people who, realizing that their civilization
could not stand still forever, began to go for short walks.''
   The offbeat sense of humor seemed to take the pressure off the
participants and lent the album a certain mystique, said Paul Grein,
author of the Chartbeat column in Billboard magazine. It's working _
the album debuted on the charts at No. 57 and shot to No. 23 in its
second week, he said.
   ``It's destined to be a very big hit,'' Grein said.
   The Wilbury monikers also took some pressure off the businessmen,
since Harrison, Dylan, Petty and Orbison are all contracted to
different record companies. There are more than just joking reasons
why all the names were left off the album jacket.
   Petty said the Wilburys have been approached to do a tour, and
though no one's said no, they haven't all said yes, either.
   He hinted that the Wilbury family tree might be larger, but
wouldn't say if a ``Volume Two'' is planned. There's the obvious
risk of losing the spark that made this record special.
   ``I don't think anybody wants the Wilburys to be work,'' he said.
``I would leave the door open to that. We wouldn't rule it out
because we had so much fun. I think it could be done again, but not
right away.
   ``We were all very pleased with the way it came out,'' Petty
continued. ``It's so nice when you get the spirit into the vinyl.
That's what you strive for. I hope everybody smiles when they hear
it.''

   Jamie Kalven spent a decade shaping a book out of
1,000-page manuscript and a mountain of raw material _ the
unfinished life's work of his father, a legal scholar.
   Although Harry Kalven died with his task incomplete, he helped
his son see it through.
   The result is ``A Worthy Tradition,'' a 700-page act of filial
devotion, a scholarly essay on the First Amendment and how its
protections were broadened by the Supreme Court between World War I
and the early 1970s.
   ``Almost everything I know about my father's views of the Fiame after
his death,'' said Kalven, who is not a lawyer.
   The First Amendment, his father said, has been continually
enriched and elaboraterst
Amendment cd by the ongoing dialogue of society and
courts addressing the countless issues it embraces.
   Among the book's central themes is an argument that criticism of
the government or its officials _ seditious libel _ should never be
a crime.
   ``A Worthy Tradition'' was published this year by Harper & Row
and sells for $35. The book bears the elder Kalven's name as author
with a notation that his son edited it.
   Harry Kalven was a noted legal scholar at the Universiteatle.
   McCartney played piano, sang harmony and was producer of the song
``T-shirt'' on the Nashville band's current album of the same name.
   ``They are probably the first rock 'n' roll band I remember,''
McCartney said in a promotional videotape for the Crickets. ``I've
always been a fan of theirs.''
   The McCartney-Crickets collaboration, done at McCartney's
recording studio in England, evolved from the Crickets' appearance
two years ago at McCartney's annual Buddy Holly Week celebration. At
that time, the ex-Beatle said he was interested in working with the
group.
   The album is the first in about 10 years for the Crickets, whose
name inspired McCartney and John Lennon to name their band after
another insect.
   ``It is basic rock 'n' roll with three pieces (instruments),''
says Cricket Jerry ``J.I.'' Allison, a drummer. ``It's basically
what we did back in the '50s.''
   Allison, Holly and Joe B. Mauldin, who is still a member, founded
the Crickets in Lubbock, Texas, in 1957. They were known for such
hits as ``Peggy Sue,'' ``That'll Be the Day'' and ``Maybe Baby.''
   Holly died on Feb. 3, 1959, with Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``Big
Bopper'' Richardson when a tour plane they were flying in crashed in
a Iowa cornfield. The pilot also perished.
   Holly's life was the subject of the 1979 movie, ``The Buddy Holly
Story'' starring Gary Busey. Valens' life was recounted in the
recent motion picture ``La Bamba.'' Los Lobos did a version of the
traditional Mexican song Valens had made into a hit, ``La Bamba,''
and made it a No. 1 tune on the record charts in 1987.
   Allison and Mauldin were not with Holly when the plane crashed
because Holly had moved from Texas to New York City and was using
new members of his band.
   The two performed occasionally as Crickets in the 1960s, but did
not really get back together until 10 years ago. At that time, they
began performing as Crickets again as the opening act for country
music star Waylon Jennings, who had been accompanying Holly on the
concert tour when he was killed. In fact, Jennings gave up his seat
on the plane to the Big Bopper.
   The third current Cricket is Gordon Payne, lead vocalist and
guitarist, who joined in 1985.
   Payne admits he doesn't sound like Holly. ``I've tried, but I
don't,'' he said of the former bandleader's style.
   The band plays an equal amount of new and old material, though
the album is new songs. They close their concerts with ``That'll Be
the Day.''
   ``It was our first song and got us started and out of Texas,''
Allison recalled. ``It seems to be the most familiar one to all the
people.''
   In the past year, the three have performed throughout the United
States and Europe and in Australia and Canada. A tour of Japan is in
the works for 1989.
   Allison said the Crickets played in garages in Lubbock in the
1950s, but did not take their name from a cricket they heard
chirping as portrayed in the movie about Holly. Instead, they were
inspired by another band called the Spiders.
   ``We thought insects were a neat name. We got a list from
somewhere and decided to pick another insect,'' Allison said.
   He said Holly's legacy is that ``he showed that you don't have to
be a real `pretty boy' or that you don't have to have a lot of money
to entertain or have a rock 'n' roll band.
   ``It showed a lot of people that you could get up and write some
songs and play and not have a whole bunch of publicity behind you.
We sort of wrote the songs ourselves and produced them ourselves. He
wasn't your idol-looking kind of guy you'd see in Photoplay. He just
wanted to sing and play,'' he said.
   ``It was simple music, uncomplicated so anybody could pick it up.
I've heard that anybody could go get a guitar on Saturday night and
learn `That'll Be the Day' and those three-chord songs and have 'em
a little group. Before that, it seemed harder.''
   Said Payne: ``He sang with such feeling and intensity. Even Bruce
Springsteen says he listens to old Crickets' records to `keep it
honest.' He left behind a mold for other singers: what you're
supposed to try to do.''
   Mauldin, the Crickets' bass player, said he didn't try to
interfere with McCartney's work on their album. ``He asked for
suggestions. My answer was usually, `Whatever you think, Paul. '''

<HEAD>Clash Over Theory Blaming Genetic Flaw For Many Mental Disorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geneticist and his psychologist wife say
they have linked mental disorders including mania, depression,
hyperactivity, compulsive overeating and alcoholism to a single,
inherited genetic flaw.
   If they're right, the finding could revolutionize the treatment
of mental illness. Difficult and expensive psychotherapy could be
replaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect.
   However, some geneticists say Dr. David Comings of the City of
Hope National Medical Center and his wife, Brenda, are guilty of a
colossal mistake or careless misuse of science.
   An angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics where David
Comings, president of the society this year, used his presidential
address to defend his findings.
   He detailed a long list of behavioral disorders that he said
occurred with unusually high frequency in the relatives of people
with Tourette syndrome.
   David Pauls of Yale University presented similar research that
directly contradicted the Comings' findings. Pauls and his
colleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders in
families with Tourette syndrome.
   After Pauls presented his data and responded to critical
questions from David Comings, geneticists lingered to continue the
discussion.
   ``I disagree with you completely,'' Dr. Arno Motulsky, professor
of medicine and genetics at the University of Washington, told the
Comingses. ``You make these grandiose schemes without evidence.''
   In Motulsky's view, that's a misuse of scientific data _ making
hypotheses that can't be supported by the facts.
   ``You revolutionize genetics if it's true _ but I think it's very
unlikely,'' he said. David Comings was visibly hurt by the
criticism; Motulsky had been his teacher.
   ``I think you are making claims that harken back to the early
days of genetics... I think you're doing genetics a disservice,''
Motulsky continued, referring to the early 20th century, when
laziness, prostitution and criminality were said to be the result of
bad genes.
   The implication was that it was a good idea to sterilize such
people, thereby ridding the population of undesirable traits, says
Daniel J. Kevles, a historian at the California Institute of
Technology and author of ``In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the
Uses of Human Heredity.''
   Making such generalizations has led to wildly erroneous and
damaging misuse of science in the past and could easily do so again,
Kevles said. He said he hadn't read the Comingses' report and
couldn't comment on it directly.
   Not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of the
Comingses' work. Some praised the pair for their courage in
proposing such a daring hypothesis.
   Dr. Victor McKusick of Johns Hopkins University, a medical
geneticist who has done extensive family studies with the Amish in
Pennsylvania, said, ``I lean toward the view that David Comings is
closer to the truth. He's a perceptive person.''
   Dr. David Rimoin, director of medical genetics at the University
of California, Los Angeles, noted that even if the Tourette gene is
responsible for some cases of mania, hyperactivity and compulsive
behavior it is not likely to be the cause of all cases of those
disorders.
   ``Many different causes can produce the same disease traits,''
and a single disorder _ such as Tourette _ can show itself in many
ways, ``so I'm not surprised'' by the Comings findings, Rimoin said.
   Even the Comingses' most ferocious critics accused them of no
worse offense than shoddy science; there was no suggestion of
deliberate distortion.
   The Comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies of
families of patients with Tourette syndrome, an inherited disorder
marked by jerky movements, or tics, and uncontrollable vocal
mannerisms including grunts, yelps, barks and sometimes involuntary
outbursts of profanity.
   The syndrome had been thought rare, occurring in at least one in
2,000 Americans, but David Comings said in an interview he believes
it occurs in as many as 1 in 200 _ or about 1 million _ Americans,
usually becoming evident in the young, more often in boys than in
girls.
   In a 166-page report in the American Journal of Human Genetics,
the Comingses said that attention-deficit disorder, with or without
hyperactivity, is 10 times more common in Tourette families than in
the general population. Obsessive-compulsive behavior is five times
as common. Conduct disorders, 17 times as common. Stuttering, five
times. Dyslexia, six times. Panic attacks, 13 times. Multiple
phobias, three times. Depression, 11 times. Mania and severe
anxiety, 20 times as common.
   At the genetics meeting, Comings added alcoholism, compulsive
overeating and drug abuse. Other associated symptoms include
auditory hallucinations, short temper, exhibition and easiness to
anger.
   All of these disorders are manifestations of the
yet-to-be-discovered gene that causes Tourette syndrome, the couple
asserted.
   They explain the findings by suggesting that the gene is
associated with a biochemical loss of inhibitions. ``Many of the
features of (Tourette syndrome) can be visualized as disinhibited,
active, intrusive symptoms...,'' they wrote.
   David and Brenda Comings say Pauls doesn't see the connections
because, unlike them, he doesn't treat patients with Tourette
syndrome. Pauls is a geneticist, not a psychologist.
   Pauls says his studies included interviews with many relatives of
Tourette syndrome patients, while many of the Comingses' studies
were based on interviews with only patients and their parents.
   ``Our (finding) is based on direct interview information,'' Pauls
said. ``Theirs is based more on clinical impression.''
   In a lengthy letter in the American Journal of Human Generics,
Pauls and his Yale colleagues exhaustively criticized the Comingses'
findings.
   They said the weaknesses in their research ``make it impossible
to accept as valid any of the results presented...'' That's strong
language for an exchange in a scientific journal.
   ``One of our major criticisms of Comings is that he confuses
symptoms with diagnosis,'' said Kenneth Kidd, one of the Yale
researchers. ``Tourette syndrome patients have symptoms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder but do not have the disorder...
Different disorders can have symptoms in common.''
   Sue Levi, past president of the Tourette Syndrome Association in
New York City, said the Comingses' findings have created confusion
among patients. ``Our organization was contacted by people who have
problems with substance abuse, problems with obesity, problems with
anorexia'' who suddenly thought they might be carriers of the
Tourette syndrome gene, Levi said.
   ``We had to be even-handed about saying the jury is out,'' she
said.
   The jury may not be out for long. The association is spending
$200,000 this year to enable six laboratories in the United States
and Europe to search for the Tourette syndrome gene, or a genetic
marker that will indicate its approximate location on human
chromosomes.
   Once such a marker is found, researchers will be able to directly
test the Comingses' hypothesis. That could happen within the next
few years or the next few months, Levi said.
   Despite their differences, David and Brenda Comings and the Yale
group agree on one thing: Resolution of the controversy will benefit
patients.
   ``The progress of science often involves debate and argument over
data that don't agree, trying to find out why they don't agree,''
said Kidd.
   ``In the best sense, this controversy can help the broader
scientific community understand what is different about the two
groups. Maybe some third party will gain some insight that neither
of us has.''

<HEAD>Family Builds Group To Fight Cancer Following Son's Death From
Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Irving and Gertrude Swerdlow's son,
Paul, died of cancer, they felt pain, then anger and bitterness, and
finally resolve.
   ``When you lose your own child, you have a responsibility to see
that his life has not been totally wasted,'' said Gertrude Swerdlow.
``You also have a responsibility to other parents.''
   The Swerdlows started FACT, a grassroots organization aimed at
raising public awareness of cancer and persuading the government and
public to spend more fighting a disease that touches three out of
four American families.
   Like many Americans, they gave little thought about the extent of
cancer until their son, a 41-year-old physician in nuclear medicine
and radiology, died from leukemia Feb. 28, 1985.
   ``The things we saw made us very, very unhappy with ourselves and
very unhappy with the world we live in,'' said Irving Swerdlow.
``Why don't we lick this thing, this cancer?''
   FACT, which has grown to over 22,000 people in 18 states in 2{
years, initially was called Families Against Cancer Terror, but
`Terror' was dropped after groups like the American Cancer Society
protested its negative connotations.
   ``Anyone who's ever suffered through the pain of cancer with a
loved one knows terror is an accurate description of what this
diseases puts individuals and families through,'' said Swerdlow,
whose eyes still become moist when he speaks of cancer's toll on his
family.
   FACT doesn't promote itself as a support group, but it has that
effect.
   ``It wasn't until we learned about FACT that we realized we
weren't as alone as we felt,'' said Gail Bouverat of Syracuse, whose
17-year-old son Marc died in February, 22 months after being
diagnosed with brain cancer.
   ``You know an individual doesn't get cancer, a family does. It's
a wonderful idea to band families together,'' she said. ``It's not
the original purpose, but it does become a support network, too.''
   FACT's main purpose is to refute the idea that scientists are
winning the battle against cancer. That misperception has effected
funding for groups like the National Cancer Institute and American
Cancer Society.
   ``We're making progress, there's no doubt. But when you talk
about cancer, you're talking about hundreds of different kinds, from
just as many causes. The fight against cancer has gotten a lot of
publicity but the fact remains, we're not doing as nearly enough as
we can or should be doing,'' said Swerdlow.
   ``Cancer is an epidemic,'' added Mrs. Swerdlow. ``It's a national
problem that needs a national solution, the threat is so great.''
   Here are some of the grim facts they cite:
   _More than 500,000 Americans die yearly from cancer, another 1
million are diagnosed and another 5 million are treated.
   _Cancer claims a life in this country every 80 seconds on average.
   _One out of every three children born this year stands a chance
of developing some type of cancer in his or her lifetime.
   _Cancer is the greatest killer of children and kills more people
through the age of 54 than any other cause.
   _Cancer drains the U.S. economy of approximately $70 billion
yearly in earnings lost and medical care costs.
   ``This year, eight times as many people will die of cancer than
died in the entire Vietnam war. Look at what we spend to prevent
enemies from attacking our country. But here we have a silent enemy
that is invading millions of bodies, and we're not mobilizing our
resources,'' said Swerdlow.
   ``It's useful to have groups like this,'' said Dr. Peter
Greenwald, the director for cancer control and prevention at the NCI
in Bethesda, Md. ``The more the public understands cancer research
and what it takes to battle cancer, the better the chances we can
conquer it.''

<HEAD>Earth's Climatological Past, Future Locked In Ice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Chester Langway's laboratory holds six miles
of ice that reveal volumes about Earth's past and, perhaps, its
future.
   ``It's all there ... frozen in time,'' said Langway, whose
University of Buffalo lab contains the nation's store of ice core
samples from Greenland and Antarctica _ a record of natural history
stretching 150,000 years.
   Ice, formed as layer after layer of snow fell and was compacted,
provides a seasonal record more detailed than tree rings or sea
floor sediments, he said.
   Using techniques Langway pioneered, researchers have begun
analyzing ancient ice molecules. Oxygen isotopes record yearly
temperature variations. Dust levels show prehistoric volcanic
activity. Tiny bubbles of air give direct evidence of what the
atmosphere was like thousands of years ago. The water that makes up
the ice can indicate natural levels of elements such as lead,
cadmium, sulfur and chlorine, and can be used to gauge the effect
industrial activity.
   The ice cores, six miles of them, are kept in 4-inch-diameter,
meter-long aluminum cylinders in a refrigerator at 10 degrees below
zero. Technicians in parkas, their beards and eyebrows frosted,
prepare the ice for Langway's experiments and for shipment to
scientists at another universities.
   ``We're just beginning to unlock the secrets in the ice,'' said
Langway, 59, a heavy-set, chain-smoking geology professor who has a
mountain named after him in Antarctica. He sometimes jokes about
spending more than five years in polar regions researching ice _
``Man is the only animal stupid enough to wander about out there'' _
but he clearly believes in his work.
   Particularly in some controversial research involving gases
trapped in the ice cores. Scientists have noted a sharp increase in
carbon dioxide in the last 150 years since the beginning of the
industrial age, part of the debate about the ``greenhouse effect,''
global warming from the buildup of heat-trapping gases from
industrial emissions and deforestation.
   ``A full understanding of how the planet works can't be obtained
without considering the ice,'' Langway said. Changes in the level of
carbon dioxide in the past have coincided with changes in the
climate. Levels of the gas may even be part of a mechanism that
causes ice ages and global warming trends.
   There have been seven or eight times when the Earth's climate
changed drastically, with glaciers enveloping the continents and
then retreating, he explained. Carbon dioxide levels were very low
20,000 years ago, when the Earth was at its coldest. About 13,000
years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide began to increase. About
10,000 years ago, the ice began to retreat amidst violent weather
changes probably brought about by increase volcanic activity.
   Some scientists think the Earth may soon undergo a major climate
change brought on by pollution. They have developed computer models
showing disastrous consequences such as droughts and rising ocean
levels over the next 50 years.
   Langway, however, is emphatic about not drawing conclusions for
the future from current ice core research. ``You can speculate like
hell, but we just haven't done enough research to have all the
answers.''
   One problem is a shortage of ice. Greenland's ice sheet is the
size of the United States east of the Mississippi, and Antarctica is
10 times larger; even six miles of cores in storage is ``like
putting a teacup in Boston and one in Florida and trying to figure
out what's been going on in between,'' he said.
   Langway will take part in two international expeditions next year
that will drill in Greenland and Antarctica _ the first new drilling
since 1981.

<HEAD>Clash Over Theory Blaming Genetic Flaw For Many Mental Disorders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geneticist and his psychologist wife say
they have linked mental disorders including mania, depression,
hyperactivity, compulsive overeating and alcoholism to a single,
inherited genetic flaw.
   If they're right, the finding could revolutionize the treatment
of mental illness. Difficult and expensive psychotherapy could be
replaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect.
   However, some geneticists say Dr. David Comings of the City of
Hope National Medical Center and his wife, Brenda, are guilty of a
colossal mistake or careless misuse of science.
   An angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics where David
Comings, president of the society this year, used his presidential
address to defend his findings.
   He detailed behavioral disorders that he said occurred with
unusually high frequency in relatives of those with Tourette
syndrome, including attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive
behavior, stuttering, dyslexia, multiple phobias, depression, mania
and severe anxiety, alcoholism, drug abuse and compulsive overeating.
   David Pauls of Yale University presented similar research that
directly contradicted the Comings' findings. Pauls and his
colleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders in
families with Tourette syndrome.
   After Pauls presented his data and responded to critical
questions from David Comings, geneticists lingered to continue the
discussion. Not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of the
Comingses' work. Some praised the pair for their courage in
proposing such a daring hypothesis. Even their strongest critics
accused them of no worse offense than shoddy science.
   The Comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies of
families of patients with Tourette syndrome, an inherited disorder
marked by jerky movements, or tics, and uncontrollable vocal
mannerisms including grunts, yelps, barks and sometimes involuntary
outbursts of profanity.
   They say Pauls doesn't see the connections because, unlike them,
he doesn't treat patients with Tourette syndrome.
   Pauls, a geneticist, says his studies included interviews with
many relatives of Tourette syndrome patients, while many of the
Comingses' studies were based on interviews with only patients and
their parents.
   Sue Levi, past president of the Tourette Syndrome Association in
New York City, said the association is spending $200,000 this year
to enable six labs in the United States and Europe to search for the
gene, or a genetic marker that will indicate its approximate
location on human chromosomes.

<HEAD>Family Builds Group To Fight Cancer After Son's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Irving and Gertrude Swerdlow's son,
Paul, died of cancer, they felt pain, then anger and bitterness, and
finally resolve.
   ``When you lose your own child, you have a responsibility to see
that his life has not been totally wasted,'' said Gertrude Swerdlow.
``You also have a responsibility to other parents.''
   The Swerdlows started FACT, a grassroots organization aimed at
raising public awareness of cancer and persuading the government and
public to spend more fighting a disease that touches three out of
four American families.
   Like many Americans, they gave little thought about the extent of
cancer until their son, a 41-year-old physician in nuclear medicine
and radiology, died from leukemia Feb. 28, 1985.
   ``The things we saw made us very, very unhappy with ourselves and
very unhappy with the world we live in,'' said Irving Swerdlow.
``Why don't we lick this thing, this cancer?''
   FACT, which has grown to over 22,000 people in 18 states in 2{
years, does not promote itself as a support group, but it has that
effect.
   ``It wasn't until we learned about FACT that we realized we
weren't as alone as we felt,'' said Gail Bouverat of Syracuse, whose
17-year-old son Marc died in February, 22 months after being
diagnosed with brain cancer. ``You know an individual doesn't get
cancer, a family does.''
   FACT's main purpose is to refute the idea that scientists are
winning the battle against cancer. That misperception has effected

<HEAD>NASA, Forest Service Developing New Tool To Map Forest Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service and NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory have started to develop an aircraft-mounted,
computerized sensing system to quickly map forest fires and their
hot spots.
   FIREFLY will be an improvement over the existing FLAME system,
which has been used extensively to map major fires, including last
summer's conflagration at Yellowstone National Park.
   FLAME captures infrared heat measurements on film, but the
aircraft carrying it must land and an interpreter then must transfer
the information by hand to maps in a process that takes hours, said
lab spokesman Jim Wilson.
   FIREFLY will provide maps in minutes, using Global Positioning
System satellites to make more accurate measurements and to transmit
data directly to fire camps for computerized plotting on maps.
   ``Cutting the turnaround time in getting information to the
firefighters is the key,'' said J. David Nichols, FIREFLY manager at
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which runs America's unmanned space
exploration program for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   FIREFLY will incorporate technical developments made by NASA in
its remote-sensing programs and efforts to enhance spacecraft-made
pictures of other planets. The agencies hope to test its components
during the 1991 fire season and have it fully operation during the
1992 season, Wilson said.

<HEAD>Preschool Accidents May Forecast More Injuries Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children who seem prone to injury as preschoolers
are at high risk of more accidents between ages 5 and 10, a new
study suggests.
   Parents of 10,394 British children were asked about injuries
requiring medical advice or treatment, including poisonings and
nonaccidental injuries. Those who had three or more serious injuries
before age 5 were nearly six times as likely to have at least three
more accidents between ages 5 and 10.
   Early injuries were the most potent of several characteristics
predicting accidents between ages 5 and 10, and may indicate
children who need preventive help, said the researchers from Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York City and the University of
Bristol in England. The study is reported in the November issue of
the journal Pediatrics.
   Despite the association between early and later injuries,
researchers said most children who had multiple accidents after age
5 had not had three or more injuries before that age. This finding
emphasizes the need to provide a safe environment for all children,
they said.
   Other characteristics found to predict injuries between ages 5
and 10 were being a boy, aggressive behavior, having a young mother
and having many older and few younger siblings.

<HEAD>Panel Says Medical Education Should Include Community Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical students should be required to perform
community service as part of their training to become physicians, a
panel of doctors and medical school officials has concluded.
   The requirement would ``reinforce and demonstrate student and
institutional commitment to the tenet that physicians have
responsibilities for improving the health of the communities they
serve,'' especially the poor and those lacking access to medical
care, the panel said.
   The committee, convened under the auspices of the New York
Academy of Medicine, said opinions differed on when the community
service should be done and how long it should last.
   The recommendation was among several on medical education to
emerge from a November conference. Other suggestions included
greater emphasis on training in outpatient care settings.
   Cindy Osman, president of the American Medical Student
Association, endorsed the community service recommendation and the
other conclusions of the report. ``A community experience sensitizes
you to needs you may not otherwise see,'' she said in a statement.

<HEAD>Wage Growth Pressure Should Increase Next Year, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread labor shortages and higher inflation
will increase the pressure on U.S. employers to raise salaries and
benefits in 1989, according to the Conference Board.
   The business-financed research group said in a report released
today that its panel of 10 business and human resources experts
predicted private industry wages and benefits would grow by 5
percent next year, up from 3.7 percent in the year ended this
September.
   That compares with expected inflation of 5 percent next year,
which would be up from the current annual rate of 4.2 percent for
1988.
   ``Six full years of economic recovery have produced the tightest
labor market in decades,'' said Audrey Freedman, the Conference
Board management counsellor. ``Business seems to have reached the
edge of the population's capacity to produce additional trained
workers.''
   ``Employers are staffing their operations with greater difficulty
and at rising cost,'' Freedman said.
   Panelists indicated many employers would attempt to deal with
labor shortages by increasing productivity, creating entirely new
jobs and tapping the continuing growth in the number of women
workers.
   The panelists stated labor shortages next year would continue to
be the worst in such major metropolitan areas as Boston, Los
Angeles, Atlanta and northern New Jersey, and were spreading to
growth areas such as Greensboro, N.C. and Richmond, Va.
   ``It is often difficult to fill secretarial and clerical
positions in downtown areas, such as Los Angeles, due to
less-than-attractive commuting situations and the high costs of
parking, food and dress,'' said Irving Margol, and executive vice
president of Security National Bank in Los Angeles.
   ``Thus, `stealing' efficient secretaries occurs not only between
companies but also within companies,'' he said.
   The panel also indicated there are shortages of highly skilled
workers, including teachers, nurses and other licensed health care
workers, in many regions.
   Some of the nation's greatest labor shortages were in the
category of lower-paid, entry-level jobs that are staffed largely by
16-24 year olds with no formal training or experience, the
Conference Board stated. However, the proportion of 16-24 year olds
in the work force is declining, while many of the 10 million of the
new jobs created in the past five years have been such entry-level
type positions.
   ``The rising and continuing demand for these workers have
virtually exhausted the diminishing supply of employable peopole who
are able and willing to accept work,'' said Mitchell S. Fromstein,
president of Manpower Inc., the Milwaukee-based temporary employment
concern. ``This phenomenon was anticipated by demographers,
economists and planners, yet has caught many major employers by
surprise as it unfolds.''

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today.
Stock prices plunged due to concern over higher oil prices and the
possibility of a U.S. interest rate increase.
   At the end of trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.00 yen, up
0.85 yen from Friday's close of 121.15 yen. Expectations that the
U.S. Federal Reserve may raise key lending rates fueled dollar
purchases, dealers said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues plunged 380.27 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at
28,983.32.
   Analysts said a combination of the firmer dollar and investors'
concern over a possible rate increase and higher oil prices
triggered a round of profit-taking.
   It was the largest decline posted by the index since Aug. 29.
   The dollar was bought in expectation that U.S. monetary
authorities may raise prime lending rates and the nation's discount
rate, the rate the Federal Reserve Board charges on loans to
commercial banks, a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said.
   Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita told reporters Monday that
Japan's central bank was closely watching for a possible move by the
Federal Reserve, Kyodo News Service said.
   The dollar opened higher at 121.60 yen and moved between 121.58
yen and 122.00 yen throughout the day.
   The firmer dollar and expectations of a tightening by the Federal
Reserve encouraged investors to take profits from the recent rally
on the Tokyo stock market, pushing prices lower, analysts said.
   Investors were ready for a round of profit-taking after an
eight-session rally that ended early last week, traders said. During
the rally the Nikkei rose 1,263 points, or 4.5 percent. Until
Monday, it had given up only about 67 points of that gain.
   ``The view is spreading that there is a strong likelihood the
U.S. will raise its discount rate,'' said a division chief at
Taiheiyo Securities Co., who asked not to be named.
   The dollar's rebound was also hard on prices, he said. The market
has risen along with the stronger yen, which is believed to dampen
inflation by lowering import prices, taking pressure off the Bank of
Japan to tighten its monetary policy.
   Trading was heaviest in large-volume steels and heavy industrials.
   Investors sold steels, constructions and oil issues, anticipating
that prices will rise when an agreement on production limits is
reached in Vienna among the members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.

   Crude oil loading is gradually increasing
at Kharg Island, Iran's chief export terminal, after repairs of some
of the damage caused duirng the war with Iraq, the Middle East
Economic Survey reported Monday.
   The respected oil publication said five loading berths are
operating out of the total of 14. Loading by third party vessels at
two of the berths started last month, it said.
   Kharg's capacity is designed at 6.8 million barrels a day but
current facilities can handle 2.5 million barrels a day.
   Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire in their eight-year war in
August.

<HEAD>Machinists Accept Pratt & Whitney Offer; Union Forecasts Tough Road
Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union official predicted ``difficult
times'' at Pratt & Whitney after machinists narrowly approved a new
contract despite cuts in medical benefits that angered many workers.
   Sunday's vote was 3,632-3,611 to accept the contract.
   ``With 50 percent of the people unhappy, I would say we're
probably going to go through some difficult times,'' said George S.
Almeida, one of the chief negotiators for local 91 of the
Machinists' union, which represents about 9,000 Pratt & Whitney
workers.
   Another 4,000 workers are covered by the contract.
   Negotiators for the union and the jet engine manufacturer reached
an agreement on the contract last week.
   It calls for wage increases of 9 percent spread over three years,
and retains a semi-annual cost-of-living adjustment for the
machinists, whose pay averages about $12.70 per hour.
   Most workers who opposed the contract objected to a provision
requiring workers to pay 20 percent of their hospitilaztion costs,
up to a maximum of $500 per year for individuals and $1,000 per
family. Previously, the company had paid all hospitalization costs
above $150.
   ``Now they want to `80-20' us,'' said Charlie Klein, an East
Hartford machinist who voted against the contract. ``What's next?
Seventy-thirty? Fifty-fifty?''
   The contract covers workers at Pratt & Whitney plants in East
Hartford, Southington, North Haven and Middletown. The company,
which employs 45,000 people in the United State and Canada, is a
division of United Technologies Corporation.
   ``We're extremely pleased that the union membership has voted to
approve the contract,'' said Pratt & Whitney spokesman Curt Linke.
``We're disappointed by the closeness of the vote, but we had to
address what is both a local and a national problem of rising health
care costs.''
   Sunday's voting at the Hartford Civic Center was anything but a
solidarity rally. Angry workers filled the auditorium with boos as
union negotiators read unpopular portions of the contract.
   Before the results were announced, many workers were talking
about striking.
   ``It gets to a point, over time, where you've got to take a
stand,'' said Greg Pixton, a machinist in East Hartford.
   Pixton said workers are particularly concerned about health
benefits because of the ``obvious physical hazards of the job,''
including potentially dangerous machines and chemicals.
   Union leaders, including Almeida, had urged workers to accept the
contract. They said the contract ``gains significant ground'' in
four areas: raises instead of lump sum payments, job security,
pensions, and union security.
   ``Our health insurance has suffered a loss in some areas,'' the
union negotiating committee said in a statement urging workers to
ratify the contract. ``It remains, however, the best health care
coverage among UTC companies, and is better than the health care
coverage at General Electric, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and
Lockheed.''
   Almeida said negotiators accepted the cut in health benefits
``based on the way negotiations have been going throughout the
country.''
   Almeida said he understood from the negotiations that the new
80-20 provision will eventually affect all UTC workers. He estimated
that the policy, when applied to the entire corporation, will save
UTC $30 to $40 million per year.

   What may be the largest single gold deposit ever
discovered in Idaho _ an estimated 2 million ounces _ has been found
in central Idaho, Burlington Resources Inc. announced today.
   The discovery was made by Burlington's precious metals
subsidiary, Meridian Gold Co., at its Beartrack Joint Venture
property near Salmon in Idaho's Lemhi County.
   In a news release, Meridian said an independent consulting
geologist estimates the potential geologic resource at the site at
more than 36.9 million tons, averaging .055 ounce of gold per ton,
and containing about 2.03 million ounces of gold.
   Meridian is the manager of the Beartrack venture, with a 60
percent share. Canyon Resources Corp. of Golden, Colo., and its
Minex partners own the remaining 40 percent.
   To date, more than 100 test holes have been drilled at the
50-square-mile site. Meridian plans additional drilling and geologic
studies before deciding next year whether to develop a mine.

<HEAD>Newspaper Executive Resigns in Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior executive of Japan's largest newspaper
resigned Monday to take responsibility for involving the prominent
daily in a stock trading scandal, the newspaper reported.
   An official of Yomiuri Shimbun said Iwao Maruyama, 67, vice
president of the nationally circulated newspaper, had resigned,
saying: ``I would like to take moral responsibility as I gave
serious trouble to the Yomiuri newspaper.''
   His resignation was accepted at a special board of directors
meeting, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity,.
   Maruyama bought 5,000 shares of Rescruit-Cosmos, a real estate
firm, in the fall of 1986 before the stock was offered to the public.
   On Saturday, a Yomiuri spokesman quoted Maruyama as saying he
bought the shares ``without even knowing they were unlisted.''
Saturday night, Maruyama brought the actual shares to a news
conference to prove he had not sold them for a profit.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun said Monday in a statement: ``It is
regrettable that he (Maruyama) had not disclosed his purchase of
stock until recently as he is an executive of the newspaper that has
been working to make clear the scandal.''
   It said the newspaper's investigation of the scandal would not be
affected by Maruyama's actions.
   Maruyama was the second newspaper excutive to resign for
involvement in the scandal. Ko Morita, president of the financial
newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quit in July after his purchase of
Recruit-Cosmos stock became known.
   Recruit officials made the stock available to some of the
nation's top politicians, businessmen and journalists, who reaped
huge proficts after the company was listed on the over-the-counter
market in October 1986.
   No laws were broken, but the transactions raised serious ethical
questions about the ties between big business and politics in Japan.
The government has since tightened the laws on insider stock
trading, but the measures are not retroactive.
   Prime Minister Nobuo Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone are among those who have
acknowledged their aides bought Recruit stock, but they all have
denied they knew about it at the time.
   Opposition parties have charged that more than 1 million shares
were involved and that Hiromasa Ezoe, who has since resigned as
chairman of Recruit Corp., the parent company of Recruit-Cosmos,
offered them to a few hundred prominent people in return for favors.
   One of Ezoe's aide, Hiroshi Matsubara, was arrested on bribery
chares in October after he offered money to an opposition lawmaker
in an effort to obtain a favorable investigation of Rescruit-Cosmos
in Parliament.

   Stocks opened mixed today in slow trading,
influenced by new uncertainty about the outlook for inflation,
interest rates and the dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.62 points to
2,079.30 by 10 a.m. EST.
   Among broader indicators, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index of all listed issues rose 0.34 to 150.97. The American Stock
Exchange market-value index rose 0.66 to 291.85.
   Gaining and declining issues were nearly even on the NYSE, with
415 up, 414 down and 495 unchanged. Volume totaled 14.96 million
shares after the first 30 minutes of trading.
   Wall Street strategists were divided about the market's
direction. Many said prices were due to strengthen given the
pessimism that has pervaded for awhile, making some stocks
attractive.
   Others said too many economic uncertainties were making stocks
risky. An Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
price-boosting accord could raise the inflation rate, the dollar has
been facing heavy selling pressure and talk has increased about a
possible Federal Reserve move to tighten interest rates.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.60 points to
2,074.68, finishing the week with a net gain of 12.27.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 513 up, 778 down and 521 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 72.09 million shares, down from 112.01
million Wednesday and the lightest total since a 48.86 million-share
day on Dec. 26, 1986.

<HEAD>Japanese Economy To Keep Expanding, Agency Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy will continue to expand in the near
future, the Economic Planning Agency said Monday as it released its
monthly leading indicator.
   ``The basic trend remains unchanged,'' an agency official said.
``The economy has remained in an expansionary phase and it will
continue to do so in the future.''
   The agency said the index jumped to 50 in September from 33.3 in
the previous two months. Ordinarily an index reading below 50
indicates an economic contraction, but agency officials said the low
readings for earlier months were statistical flukes.
   In other reports Monday on the Japanese economy:
   _Production at Japan's factories and mines rose 6.6 percent in
October from a year earlier but fell 0.8 percent on an adjusted
basis from the previous month, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry said.
   _Japanese steel makers exported 1.906 million metric tons of
steel in October, down 8.6 percent from a year earlier, but the
value of the exports rose because more of the steel was of
high-priced, specialty varieties, the Japan Iron and Steel
Federation said.
   _Japanese motor-vehicle manufacturers exported 521,932 cars and
commercial vehicles in October, down 2.1 percent from a year
earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.
   It was the seventh consecutive decline, following a 1.6 percent
decline in September. Increased overseas production by Japanese
makers has made it less urgent to export vehicles from Japan,
officials said.
   Despite the yen's sharp upturn, which has made exports less
profitable, many Japanese companies have been reporting strong gains
in sales and earnings.
   A senior EPA official was reported to have indicated last Friday
that the gross national product may have increased at an annual rate
of between 6 and 8 percent in the July-September quarter from the
previous three months.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs fell by 12
this week to a total 911, reversing a gain of 26 rigs in the
previous week, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The decline continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rig
count.
   A year ago the count was 1,161, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Kansas and Pennsylvania posted
the biggest gains in the most recent count with two additional rigs,
followed by New Mexico and Wyoming, both up by one.
   Oklahoma had the greatest decline with six fewer rigs, followed
by Texas with four and Michigan with three. Colorado, North Dakota
and Ohio each reported one fewer rig this week while California and
Louisiana were unchanged.

<HEAD>Court To Referee Railroad Dispute Over Selling Lines, Reducing
Forces</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 3 grafs on appeal challenging sale of track between
Green Bay and Milwaukee.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to referee an
important railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of
railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces.
   The court said it will use appeals involving the small Pittsburgh
& Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issues
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.
   At issue, in part, is the authority of the Interstate Commerce
Commission to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they
sell rail lines. A key related question involves the authority of
federal courts to block strikes in such cases.
   The Reagan administration supported the ICC's plea that the court
settle the issues, which have generated disagreement among lower
courts.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the
Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE) may not sell its 182 miles of
rail line in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohion without engaging
in collective bargaining.
   The appeals court said the federal Railway Labor Act requires the
railorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposed
sale would have in eliminating jobs.
   The appeals court also ruled that the federal courts lack
authority to block a strike by the workers.
   The appeals court said a federal law known as the
Norris-LaGuardia Act deprives federal judges of the power to bar
strikes in such circumstances. The appeals court rejected the
railroad's arguments that the act may be set aside in cases where
the ICC has approved proposed rail line sales.
   There is ``no inherent incompatibility'' between recent
congressional efforts to deregulate the railroad industry and the
aim of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to protect railway workers, the
appeals court said.
   ``Implicit in the congressional vision of a vigorous free market
is the realization that all major participants in the economy must
be left free to exercise their economic strength,'' the appeals
court said.
   The financially troubled P&LE announced in July 1987 it would
sell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned to
operate the lines with fewer workers.
   The ICC approved the plan without requiring the railroad to
engage in collective bargaining with its unions, which then called a
strike in September 1987.
   P&LE currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines other
than the newly formed company, called Railco.
   After Congress approved a 1980 deregulation law, the ICC has been
encouraging railroads to sell rather than abandon less profitable
regional lines.
   The commission adopted a process to streamline sales by relieving
railroads of any obligation to bargain with employees.
   In a related action, the high court rejected an appeal by labor
unions challenging the sale of 208 miles of track between Green Bay
and Milwaukee, Wis., by Chicago & North Western Transporation Co.
   The court left intact a ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals blocking a strike by the unions over the loss of some 200
jobs.
   The three cases are Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Co. vs.
Railway Labor Executives, 87-1589, P&LE Railroad vs. RLE, 87-1888
and RLE vs. C&NW, 88-464.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Open Lower on Report of Grain Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to a
report that the United States and the Soviet Union had signed a new
grain agreement in Moscow.
   The early drop in prices exemplified the old market adage, ``Buy
the rumor, sell the fact,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``An agreement was rumored last week and that drove the market up
last week. Now they're selling it off. That's it in a nutshell,'' he
said.
   The pact is reportedly a 2-year extension of the 5-year agreement
that expired Sept. 30, guaranteeing Soviet purchases of 9 million
metric tons of U.S. grain a year.
   Weekend showers in South American soybean regions helped dampen
interest in buying soybean futures, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.23{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $2.62} a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with December at $2.12} a bushel;
soybeans were 2} cents to 6\ cents lower with January at $7.59{ a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .27 cent higher with December at
73.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .33 cent higher
with January at 83 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .45 cent
higher with December at 40.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .13 cent to .75 cent higher with February at 43.20 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures closed higher on Friday while pork futures were
mixed.

   Stock prices turned narrowly lower in slow
trading today after several major banks announced they were raising
their prime lending rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.33 points to
2,069.35 by noon EST.
   Among broader indicators, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index of all listed issues slipped 0.10 to 151.55. The American
Stock Exchange market-value index rose 0.03 to 291.22.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about
7-to-5, with 686 stocks falling, 526 rising and 552 unchanged.
   NYSE volume was light, with 54.02 million shares changing hands
by midday.
   Led by Chase Manhattan, several of the nation's biggest banks
said today they were increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5
percent from 10 percent. The increase, effective immediately, pushes
the base lending rate to its highest level since May 1985, when it
was lowered a half percentage point to 10 percent.
   Today's increase was the fourth in the prime rate this year.
Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady increase
of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks.
   Stock prices fell after the announcement after having been
marginally higher in early trading.
   Dennis Jarrett, a market analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., said
the jump in the prime rate was not a surprise, but the announcement,
coupled with higher oil prices today, cut into what little
enthusiasm there had been on Wall Street.
   Oil prices were higher after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries announced a production agreement in Vienna.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was RJR Nabisco, which
picked up ] at 88].
   Advancing issues included Amoco, up 1 at 74[, and UAL, which was
up 1\ to 104}.
   Among decliners, Phelps Dodge lost 1] to 48}, and Teledyne

<DATELINE>BAYS OF HUATULCO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction crews labor seven
days a week in the blazing sun along a tropical stretch of Pacific
coastline, building what the government hopes will be Mexico's
resort paradise of the 21st century: Huatulco.
   ``It's as if the creator woke up one morning and went on a binge.
Huatulco is undoubtedly going to be the best,'' said Deputy Tourism
Secretary Guillermo Grimm, describing the resort's nine bays and
white sand beaches in a recent interview.
   Only four years ago, Huatulco was a sleepy, isolated settlement
of 3,000 people, mostly peasant farmers and fishermen.
   Since then, the government has marshalled $185 million in private
and public investment to build roads, a jetport, hotels, a marina
and a city for a population that stands at 14,000 and growing
rapidly. The resort was dedicated in a ceremony Nov. 6, while
construction continues.
   Huatulco, about 330 miles southeast of Mexico City, is testament
to the importance of tourism for a nation saddled with a $102
billion foreign debt.
   Tourism will earn Mexico $2.5 billion this year, second only to
oil. And Mexico's dependence on tourist spending is growing as it
copes with sagging oil prices and economic crisis.
   Last year, 5.4 million foreigners vacationed in Mexico, not
counting some 60 million day-trippers across the U.S. border. That
was the highest number since 1984 and represented a victory of sorts
for the government.
   Potential visitors had chosen other destinations after the
September 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the highly-publicized
murder of a U.S. drug enforcement agent earlier that year.
   With the slogan, ``Feel the Warmth of Mexico,'' the government
launched an aggressive marketing campaign in the United States,
Canada, Japan and European to bring them back.
   About 5.7 million visitors are expected for 1988, a record year,
though fewer than the 6 million anticipated before Hurricane Gilbert
and the paralyzing bankruptcy of the government-owned airline
Aeromexico.
   Gilbert's strike in September caused $86 million in structural
damages and another $125 million in lost tourist earnings in the
Caribbean resorts of Cancun, Isla Mujeres and Cozumel. The three
attractions account for 25 percent of Mexico's tourism income.
   Aeromexico's bankruptcy in April left the government-sponsored
resorts of Cabo San Lucas and Loreto in Baja California without air
service. Only this fall did a regional carrier restore a mainland
connection to Cabo San Lucas. Loreto is still unserved.
   ``The single most severe impact on tourism this year,'' is how
Grimm described the Aeromexico fiasco. Still, he exuded optimism
about the future of Mexico's tourism sector.
   ``Mexico is blessed with pluses: It has 6,000 miles of coastline,
an ideal climate, raw natural beauty and a people whose nature is
basically friendly,'' he said.
   The full project here is expected to take 30 years to complete.
By the end, the government hopes, Huatulco alone will attract 2
million visitors spending $1 billion a year.
   Following Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Loreto and Ixtapa, Huatulco is
the latest major resort complex to be developed under a master plan
implemented by the National Trust Fund for Tourism Development, or
Fonatur. The tiny government agency is the driving force behind
Mexico's bid to become America's No. 1 tourist destination.
   By combining government funds, foreign and domestic private
financing and arranging debt-for-equity swaps, Fonatur has attracted
$260 million in private investment in Mexico's tourism
infrastructure over the past six years. The agency financed 75
percent of the 75,000 new hotel rooms built in Mexico in the past
decade and sponsored the remodeling of another 12,000.
   In Huatulco, Fonatur pitched in $65 million to install
infrastructure and induce private investment. It arranged debt swaps
to partially finance construction of a $31.5 million Hotel Sheraton
and the luxury Veramar Hotel, both due to open next year.
   A $35 million, 550-room Club Med nestled alongside Huatulco's
Tangolunda Bay opened this year. Together, the three hotels are
expected to attract about 100,000 visitors in 1989, 80 percent of
them from the United States.
   Huatulco _ and Mexico _ also stand to benefit from a civil
aviation agreement initialed by Mexican and U.S. authorities in
September, increasing the number of air routes from 45 to 120 and
permitting more U.S. charter flights to Mexico. Continental Airlines
is expected to begin flights to Huatulco next spring and other
American carriers are expected to follow suit.
   The prospect of increased tourism means more jobs for a Mexican
work force that is growing by 1 million people each year. Grimm
estimates that tourism directly employs 700,000 Mexicans and
indirectly provides income for 2 million.
   When completed, Huatulco will employ 50,000 people and support a
local population of 200,000, the government says.
   ``We're most proud of the fantastic capacity of tourism to
provide jobs,'' Grimm said.

<TEXT>
   Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's biggest computer
manufacturer, said Monday its earnings nearly tripled in the first
half of its fiscal year.
   Fujitsu said it earned 27.32 billion Japanese yen, or $202.33
million, in the six months ended Sept. 30, up from 9.33 billion yen
in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 16.6 percent to
1,087 billion yen, or $8.05 billion, from 933 billion yen a year
earlier.
   Sales of telecommunications products rose 33.1 percent, while
sales of computers and data-processing equipment rose 10.5 percent
and sales of electronic components, including semiconductors, rose
30.1 percent, Fujitsu said.
   The results are consolidated to include the results of Fujitsu
subsidiaries. Yen figures are converted at a rate of 135 yen to the
dollar.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed in slow trading
today after major banks announced an increase in their prime lending
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.98 to 2,079.66
by 2 p.m. EST.
   Among broader indicators, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index of all listed issues was up 0.32 to 150.95. The American Stock
Exchange market-value index rose 0.29 to 291.48.
   However, declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of
about 7-to-6, with 734 stocks falling, 574 rising and 572 unchanged.
   NYSE volume was light, with 80.79 million shares changing hands
by mid-afternoon.
   The market fluctuated in a narrow range, opening higher but then
falling after the nation's biggest banks said they were increasing
their prime interest rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent. The
increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate to its
highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half percentage
point to 10 percent.
   Today's increase was the fourth in the prime rate this year.
Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady increase
of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the market had anticipated an increase in the
prime, so today's announcement did little damage on Wall Street.

   Iran has come away from the OPEC
bargaining table a winner _ thanks to Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
   Coming into the crucial talks on production and pricing, the
Iranian oil minister was expected to play a critical role in sorting
out the opposing interests of his country and Iraq, which recently
declared a cease-fire after an 8-year-long war.
   In the end, Aqazadeh surprised observers with his keen
negotiating skills in helping reach Monday's agreement, which
reduces the cartel's production from 22.5 million to 18.5 million
barrels a day and gives Iran and Iraq equal quotas of 2.64 million
barrels.
   The accord also maintains the cartel's target price of $18 per
barrel.
   ``He was the most political and most skilled maneuverer,'' said
Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publication
Petrostrategies.
   Bahman Karbassioun, an oil consultant based in Vienna, said, ``I
think it's the best deal he could have gotten.''
   Other ministers wanted Iraq brought back into OPEC's quota
system. The soft-spoken Aqazadeh, a former newspaper editor, was key
to that goal.
   ``They got more than what they could have imagined before (the
meeting),'' said Terzian of the agreement signed by all 13 members
of the Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The 39-year-old Aqazadeh _ a slight, bespectacled man with
prematurely graying hair and beard _ hardly looks the part of a
tough bargainer.
   Dressed modestly in a plain white shirt buttoned to the top, no
tie and dark overcoat, the Iranian gives the impression of being a
humble man.
   ``He is not what one would term a hot-headed man,'' said
Karbassioun.
   ``He's very level-headed. He's steadfast in his political
beliefs,'' he said. ``He's in no way what one would call an
extremist.''
   ``He's too intelligent not to be realistic,'' said Terzian.
   Aqazadeh was active in the Islamic revolution that ousted the
Shah of Iran in January 1979, analysts say.
   ``He's a product of the Iranian revolution,'' said Karbassioun.
   Aqazadeh, who holds a bachelor of science degree in computer
sciences, was a founding member of the Islamic Republican Party,
according to a biographical sketch.
   He was editor-in-chief of the Islamic Republic newspaper from
1979-1982 and was deputy to the prime minister from 1981 to 1985. He
has been oil minister since 1985.
   Because of his revolutionary background, Aqazadeh differs from
other OPEC ministers, some of whom are from royal families.
   ``He has both the political ability and also the logic of a
computer engineer,'' Terzian noted.
   To get the agreement, which takes effect Jan. 1 for six months,
Aqazadeh gave up what he insisted he would never do _ allow hated
rival Iraq the same production quota as that of Iran.
   Iran and Iraq want more money from their valuable resource to
help rebuild their war-damaged economies.
   Iraq had been demanding the same ceiling for years. It refused to
join the previous accord, fashioned in 1986, because it was only
given a quota of 1.5 million barrels, instead of the same 2.4
million alloted Iran.
   Aqazadeh vowed he would never permit the two countries to have
the same quota. Some delegates whispered he would resign instead.
   ``I always reject parity,'' he insisted to reporters.
   In the end he bowed to the Iraqi demand, but also raised his
country's own quota. He also was successful in pressing for the
lower total production level set for the cartel and the $18 target
price.
   ``He lost to the Iraqis; I don't think he lost to OPEC,'' said
Ian Graham, an analyst with the London brokerage County NatWest.
   Moreover, Aqazadeh succeeded in maintaining Iran's share of total
output at 14.27 percent. Iraq was bumped up to the same level after
other countries agreed to give up some of their share.
   ``He got a lot for (giving up parity),'' said Fergus MacLeod, an
oil analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.
   ``That's lot of concessions ... at the cost of giving up some
political points,'' he said.
   In addition to demonstrating negotiating skills, Aqazadeh also
was adept at telling his side of the story.
   He was one of the few ministers who would stop to answer
reporters' questions after attending closed-door discussions.
   Several times, he was mobbed by reporters, even getting hit in
the head once by a swinging tape recorder.

   Share prices closed lower Monday on the London
Stock Exchange, still depressed by dismal British trade figures
Friday and a subsequent hike in the key domestic interest rate to 13
percent.
   ``Quite frankly, the market is still shell-shocked,'' one dealer
said.
   Late-afternoon news that major U.S. banks raised their prime
lending rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent came as ``another hit
on the head to market sentiment,'' another dealer said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
13.2 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,781.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 9.7 points at 1,452.9
at the close.
   Volume was a modest 421.4 million shares, down sharply from 744.8
million shares on Friday.
   ``The only business around today was selling-related,'' one
dealer said.
   On Friday, the government announced that Britain's
current-account trade deficit more than quadrupled in October to a
record 2.43 billion pounds, or around $4.5 billion. Soon after the
report was released, the Bank of England sent a signal to Britain's
commercial banks to increase their base lending rate a full
percentage point.
   Those developments sent stock prices plummeting Friday, with the
100-share index falling more than 50 points before recovering some
of its losses.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was 5.16
points lower at 2,069.52 when the London trading session came to an
end, having opened about 5 points higher.
   London stocks managed to ignore Wall Street for most of the
afternoon but found it impossible to shrug off the prime rate hike
news, dealers said.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.62 points to close at
1,007.52.

   Major U.S. banks boosted their prime lending
rates a half percentage point to 10.5 percent Monday, the steepest
level since mid-1985 and the fourth rise this year.
   The increase will mean a jump in rates on a variety of consumer
loans pegged to the prime, including home-equity loans. It lso will
raise borrowing costs for companies that rely on banks for financing.
   Economists had been predicting a prime rate increase because
interest rates in the bond markets had risen recently due to
inflation fears and the dollar's weakness in foreign exchange
markets.
   The financial markets had no major reaction to the announcement.
Stock and bond prices were up modestly, while the dollar steadied
against other major currencies.
   ``It comes as no surprise. In fact, they (banks) seem to have
held back longer than I expected,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for the investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also has warned of
higher short-term rates unless the government trims its huge budget
deficit, the source of the dollar's woes.
   ``There's a building perception in the marketplace that the Fed
is, in fact, tightening conditions ...,'' said William V. Sullivan,
an economist for the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Sullivan and other economists predicted the Fed might soon raise
its discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to member
banks. If that happened, the prime rate could be increased again,
they said.
   ``I'd look for something (from the Fed) in the next two weeks,''
said Yardeni.
   Chase Manhattan was the first institution to increase its prime
rate Monday and other major banks quickly joined the move.
   The prime stood at 8.5 percent at the start of the year and has
been raised four times since. Monday's increase put the key lending
rate at its highest level since May 20, 1985, when it was lowered a
half percentage point to 10 percent.
   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,
including interest it pays on on savings accounts or certificates of
deposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.
   But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types
of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates are not
included in that category.
   ``It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing
costs in December or early next year,'' said Sullivan.
   Economists were uncertain as to what effect the latest increase
would have on the economy, and more specifically on consumers'
spending during the holiday season.
   James L. Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist for Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc., said, ``I think the direct effect is pretty
small because generally consumers aren't affected by modest increass
in interest rates ....''
   But Yardeni said some credit-happy consumers might want to cut
back on spending and ``buy only things that they can afford.''
   ``There's an underlying sense of uneasiness because so many
people have been through rough times even when the economy was
strong. The prime rate hike coming into the Christmas season may
make people more cautious,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
sharply lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade on profit-taking
following the announcement of a new multi-year grain deal with the
Soviet Union.
   The grain markets had rallied strongly last week in anticipation
of a grain pact, and Monday's activity was a classic example of
``buy the rumor, sell the fact,'' analysts said.
   ``We've been going up and up and up on (expectations for) this
deal and now we've finally got it,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The 27-month extension signed in Moscow revived a 5-year pact
that expired Sept. 30, calling for the Soviet Union to buy at least
9 million metric tons of grain a year from the United States.
   Spotty news of showers in the soybean-growing areas of Argentina
and Brazil also weighed on soybean prices, Lespinasse said.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 2\ cents to 7\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.18\ a bushel; corn
was 3\ cents to 8 cents lower with December at $2.57 a bushel; oats
were 10 cents lower across the board with December at $2.05 a
bushel; soybeans were 12\ cents to 15} cents lower with January at
$7.50 a bushel.

<HEAD>Court To Referee Railroad Dispute Over Selling Lines, Reducing
Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it would referee
a railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to
sell off their lines and reduce their work forces.
   Separately, the justices allowed prosecutors investigating labor
union corruption in New York to use subpoenaed membership lists
obtained from four carpenters union locals.
   The high court said it would hear a case involving the Pittsburgh
& Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issues
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.
   At issue is the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission
to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they sell rail
lines. A key related question involves the authority of federal
courts to block strikes in such cases.
   The Reagan administration supported the ICC's plea that the court
settle the issues, which have generated disagreement among lower
courts.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year the P&LE
may not sell 182 miles of rail line in western Pennsylvania and
eastern Ohion without engaging in collective bargaining.
   The appeals court said the federal Railway Labor Act requires the
railorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposed
sale would have in eliminating jobs.
   The appeals court also ruled that federal courts lack authority
to block a strike by the workers.
   The appeals court said federal law deprives federal judges of the
power to bar strikes in such circumstances. The appeals court
rejected the railroad's arguments that the act may be set aside in
cases where the ICC has approved proposed rail line sales.
   The financially troubled P&LE announced in July 1987 it would
sell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned to
operate the lines with fewer workers.
   The ICC approved the plan without requiring the railroad to
engage in collective bargaining with its unions, which then called a
strike in September 1987.
   P&LE currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines other
than the newly formed company, called Railco.
   The ICC adopted a process to streamline sales by relieving
railroads of any obligation to bargain with employees.
   Also Monday, the high court rejected an appeal by labor unions in
a related action that challenged the sale of 208 miles of track
between Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wis., by Chicago & North Western
Transporation Co.
   In the carpenters union case, the court let stand without comment
a ruling that the rights of the union and its members were not
violated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists.
   A Manhattan grand jury in February 1987 issued subpoenas for the
membership lists of the locals in connection with a probe of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners by District Attorney
Robert M. Morgenthau.
   The New York Court of Appeals ruled last July Morgenthau's office
could keep the lists pending completion of the grand jury
investigation.
   The state court said forcing the unions to turn over the lists
and allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did not
violate free-association rights of the union and its members.

   Stock prices closed little changed in light
trading today as Wall Street shrugged off an increase in the prime
lending rate.
   The market fluctuated in a narrow range throughout the day. It
opened higher but then dropped back after the nation's biggest banks
said they were increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5 percent
from 10 percent.
   The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate
to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half
percentage point to 10 percent. Today's increase was the fourth in
the prime rate this year.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the market had anticipated an increase in the
prime, so the announcement did little damage on Wall Street.
   Alfred Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis, called the session ``inconclusive,'' in part because of
several economic reports due out this week.
   On Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its
revised estimate of growth in the gross national product during the
third quarter.
   Goldman also said the market's stagnation was due to
countervailing forces. Stocks have been oversold lately and their
prices should rise, but they are being held in check by negative
factors such as rising interest rates, he said.

<HEAD>Asbestos Maker Out of Bankruptcy Court After Six Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Building-products giant Manville Corp. emerged from
more than six years of protection under federal bankruptcy court
Monday and began paying creditors and asbestos health and property
claimants.
   ``With the constraints of bankruptcy behind us, we can now
dedicate all of our attention to growing Manville and creating
shareholder value,'' Tom Stephens, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in officially marking what the company considers the
first day of the rest of its life.
   Manville sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. bankruptcy law Aug. 26, 1982, saying it faced ruin from
billions of dollars in suits claiming health problems from asbestos
once produced by the company.
   Its refuge in bankruptcy court marked one of the biggest and most
exhaustive filings in U.S. history and raised major questions about
use of the federal bankruptcy laws to defer or avoid health-related
liability claims.
   Manville helped lay the precedent for another major company, A.H.
Robins & Co., to seek Chapter 11 protection when it felt threatened
by billions of dollars in escalating health claims for a
now-discontinued controversial product, the Dalkon Shield
intrauterine birth-control device.
   The Manville bankruptcy contributed to the company's tarnished
image over the handling of asbestos claims, and some surveys called
it one of the least admired U.S. businesses.
   Before its Chapter 11 filing, property damage claims alone had
come to $85 billion, or about 40 times the company's total assets.
Manville also faced more than 17,000 personal injury claims in the
billions of dollars.
   The filing allowed Manville to operate shielded from liability
suits while it worked out a way to pay the bills. It also allowed
the company time to draft a $2.5 billion trust-fund plan to pay
asbestos victims.
   Manville's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy
court in December 1986. Following several appeals, the final order
implementing the plan was given Oct. 28, to become effective in 30
days.
   The plan has been both praised and condemned.
   Manville shareholders will be the big losers, winding up with one
share of new Manville stock for every eight shares they once held,
said Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst with Martin Simpson & Co.,
a New York investment research firm.
   ``Basically, they wiped out their shareholders. I'm disgusted
with the way Manville conducted itself,'' Crary said recently. He
accused Manville of ``gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility
to shareholders.''
   But Stephens, who took control of the company a few years ago and
is widely credited with helping steer it through the final stages of
bankruptcy, said the plan protects shareholders by restoring the
company's financial health while at the same time addressing the
asbestos claims problem.
   The reorganization plan established a Personal Injury Settlement
Trust to settle claims of asbestos health victims for the next 25
years. Manville paid $150 million into the trust and its insurers
will add $615 million. Beginning in 1991, Manville will make annual
payments to the trust of $75 million until 2012.
   A second trust, called the Property Damage Settlement Trust,
would settle asbestos-related property claims. Manville paid $100
million cash into it and the company's insurance carriers also will
contribute millions of dollars.
   Manville also faces immediate cash obligations of $247.5 million
to commercial creditors.
   Manville said that as of the close of business Monday, trading of
its old securities ceased. The new securities will trade under the
symbol MVL.
   Manville reported a $164 million profit on $2.06 billion in sales
last year.
   Today, the business consists of three parts: a fiberglass group,
which produces insulation products and glass fibers; a forest group,
producing wood and paper items; and a specialty products gorup,
making goods ranging from commercial-industrial lighting to filter
materials for the beer and wine industries.
   Founded in 1858 as Johns-Manville Corp., the firm was built into
an industry leader in the early 1900s as a manufacturer of asbestos,
the fibrous mineral once heavily used in insulation and fireproofing
materials. It was incorporated under the shortened name in 1981.
   The company's troubles began in the early 1970s when asbestos was
linked to a number of serious, often fatal diseases, including lung
cancer and asbestosis.

   The dollar advanced Monday in a rally that some
traders attributed to an OPEC agreement on production cuts and an
increase in the prime rate by major U.S. banks.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in
Vienna to set a daily production quota of 18.5 million barrels and a
target price of $18 a barrel. The announcement triggered a
$1-a-barrel increase in oil prices.
   The biggest U.S. banks raised their prime lending rates a half
percentage point to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year.
   Some analysts said the dollar's rise was hard to explain because
the prime rate increase had been widely expected and an increase in
oil prices usually does not give a big boost to the dollar. But
there were no other ready explanations for the dollar's ascent.
   ``It's a fairly impressive move by the dollar,'' said Craig
Sloane, a currency analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8385 from $1.8435 late
Friday. Later in the United States, the pound fell to $1.8399 from
$1.8424.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 122.00 Japanese yen, up from
121.15 late Friday. In London late Monday the dollar traded at
122.15 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 122.28 yen from 121.18
on Friday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in the United States, compared
with Friday's late rates, included: 1.7355 West German marks, up
from 1.7170; 1.4524 Swiss francs, up from 1.4378; 1.1931 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1903; 5.9273 French francs, up from 5.8705; and
1,286.25 Italian lire, up from 1,275.00.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Friday's
late rates, included: 1.7332 West German marks, up from 1.7154;
1.4515 Swiss francs, up from 1.4365; 5.9225 French francs, up from
5.8615; 1.9547 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9368; 1,285.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,275.50; and 1.1918 Canadian dollars.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $422.02 a troy ounce bid, down from
$424.98 in the previous session. Gold bullion closed in London at a
bid $423.85 a troy ounce, down from $424 an ounce late Friday. The
late price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $423.25 an ounce, down from
$424.00.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $423.30 a troy ounce. The Comex had been closed
on Thursday and Friday.
   Later Monday, Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $422.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST. There was
no spot trading on Thursday or Friday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.16 a troy ounce,
down from $6.18. On New York's Comex, silver closed at $6.113 an
ounce.

<HEAD>Andersen To Elevate Consulting Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen & Co. announced plans Monday to
put its consulting practice on an equal footing with its
better-known accounting business in hopes of stemming a flow of
defections to other consulting firms.
   ``More equal is probably a good way to put it,'' said Duane R.
Kullberg, managing partner and chief executive officer of
Chicago-based Andersen, the largest U.S. accounting firm and a
leader in information-management consulting.
   The announcement of the proposed corporate restructuring ended
speculation that Andersen would split off or sell its consulting
practice, a 40-year-old unit that is the fastest-growing segment of
the 75-year-old firm.
   Kullberg told a news conference that Andersen's 2,200 partners
would vote in early January on a task force's recommendation to
restructure the company along two lines: consulting and
audit-and-tax accounting. Each line would be headed by a chief
operating officer who would report to the CEO.
   Andersen currently has one chief operating officer overseeing
three divisions _ consulting, auditing and tax accounting _ with
each division headed by its own managing partner.
   Consulting partners have complained of being relegated to
second-class status by the accounting partners who traditionally
have controlled the company _ and the purse strings.
   Kullberg said a new incentive program offering substantial
bonuses for exemplary work would increase the pay of Andersen's best
consultants and help to keep them from looking elsewhere.
   ``It is intended to be an incentive system that will address that
particular question,'' he said.
   Four of Andersen's top consulting partners left the firm in
October to join Information Consulting Group Inc., a company headed
by two other former Andersen consultants that was formed with
financial backing from London-based Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, the
world's largest advertising company.
   Andersen has filed a lawsuit in state court in New York accusing
its departed consulting partners and Saatchi of trying to force
Andersen to sell at least part of its consulting business.
   The change in Andersen's corporate structure will not affect the
lawsuit, Kullberg said.
   ``We intend to pursue that lawsuit vigorously, without
question,'' he said.
   Kullberg said Andersen hoped to move beyond its frequent
categorization as an accounting firm by promoting itself as an
accounting-and-consulting company.
   Of the company's $2.8 billion in revenues in fiscal 1988, audit
and consulting work each brought in 40 percent while tax work
accounted for 20 percent.
   Kullberg also said Andersen was exploring options for increasing
its capital base but he ruled out the possibility of going public.

   Prices were little changed in quiet trading on
Wall Street Monday after major banks raised their prime lending
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.76 to 2,081.44.
   Advancing issues were about even with decliners in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 710 issues
up, 726 down and 521 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 123.48 million shares, up
from 72.09 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional
exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 145.26 million
shares.
   The market moved in a narrow range, opening marginally higher and
then dipping after the nation's largest banks said they were
increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5 percent from 10
percent.
   The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate
to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half
percentage point to 10 percent. The increase was the fourth in the
prime rate this year.
   Wall Street was expecting the increase after interest rates crept
upward in credit markets recently, so the banks' announcement had no
major effect on prices.
   Alfred Goldman, a vice president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in
St. Louis, called Monday's session ``inconclusive,'' and said
countervailing forces in the market left prices little changed.
   ``On one side of the coin we have a deep oversold condition and a
market that is very underbelieved,'' Goldman said.
   Ordinarily, that would move prices higher, but negative
influences such as rising interest rates were holding stocks in
check, Goldman said.
   Investors also were wary because of economic reports due out this
week, in particular Tuesday's scheduled release of the Commerce
Department's revised estimate of third-quarter growth in the gross
national product.
   ``The market is responding in a very uncertain, indecisive way,''
Goldman said.
   Most of the change in the Dow Jones industrial average was due to
IBM, which rose 2~ to close at 118~. The American Arbitration
Association said it would disclose on Tuesday its resolution of a
software copyright dispute between IBM and Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's
biggest computer company.
   RJR Nabisco rose 1 to 89 as speculators bid up the
food-and-tobacco giant's stock on the hunch that fattened offers
would emerge in the auction for the company. The deadline for a
second round of bids for RJR Nabisco was scheduled to expire at 5
p.m. Tuesday.
   Oil prices were among other gainers after the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a long-awaited production
agreement. Mobil was up { to 44[ and Amoco rose 1 to 74[.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was First Bank System,
which rose [ to 20.
   Among declining issues, Boeing fell 1[ to 60~ and Control Data
slipped | to 18.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $7.655 billion, or 0.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.62 to 151.25.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.78 to 309.42, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.41 to 268.64.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.29 to 366.09.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index picked up
0.48 to close at 291.67.

<HEAD>Oil, Platinum Futures Soar On OPEC Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The OPEC agreement to cut oil production sent energy and platinum
futures soaring Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange but other
precious metals posted only moderate gains.
   On other markets, grain, soybean and coffee futures fell sharply;
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly
lower; and stock-index futures advanced.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in January soared
as high as $15.80 a barrel in early trading on news of the agreement
among oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meeting in Vienna, Austria.
   But a statement from the United Arab Emirates later in the day
that it did not consider its new production limit an official quota
sparked some selling on fears that the fragile OPEC agreement could
come undone, analysts said.
   Still, nearly all energy-futures contracts advanced their daily
trading limits _ $1 a barrel for crude oil and 2 cents a gallon for
heating oil and gasoline. The contracts for near-month delivery have
no limits.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled $1 to $1.06 higher with
January at $15.03 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.93 cents
higher with December at 48.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
1.91 cents to 2 cents higher with December at 46.37 cents a gallon.
   The deal signed by all 13 OPEC members reestablishes a crude-oil
target price of $18 a barrel and reduces production from the current
estimated 22.5 million barrels a day to 18.5 million barrels.
   Monday's price gains indicated a belief among market players that
the chances of OPEC members abiding by their new production limits
were ``a little better than 50-50,'' said Andrew Lebow, an
oil-market analyst with E.D. & F. Man International Futures Inc. in
New York.
   ``If you go back to 1987, during the first half of that year
there was a general adherence to the quota,'' Lebow said. ``But as
we know from the second half of this year, they have also had
problems adhering to a quota.''
   The prospect of higher oil prices triggered a rally in the
inflation-sensitive precious-metals markets Monday but only platinum
managed to hold sharp gains into the close.
   Platinum settled $14.90 to $15.70 higher with January at $586.70
a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, which, like the New York Merc,
was closed Thursday through Sunday for Thanksgiving, gold settled
$3.10 to $3.80 higher with December at $423.30 a troy ounce; silver
settled 2 cents to 5.9 cents higher with December at $6.115 a troy
ounce.
   Platinum's move was more ``realistic'' than gold's, said Richard
Levine, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York, considering
the firming of energy prices and the relatively tight warehouse
stocks of both metals.
   New York-based analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. said the
dollar's strength on Monday may have helped limit the gains in gold
and silver.
   But Levine said the dollar's surge appeared to be a short-term
reaction to the sudden rise in energy prices.
   ``I would look for the dollar to come off if this oil price holds
and for gold to go higher,'' he said.
   Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade on profit-taking following the announcement of a new
multi-year grain deal with the Soviet Union.
   The grain markets had rallied strongly last week, including
modest gains on Friday, in anticipation of a grain pact. Monday's
activity was a classic example of ``buy the rumor, sell the fact,''
analysts said.
   The 27-month extension signed in Moscow revived a 5-year pact
that expired Sept. 30, calling for the Soviet Union to buy at least
9 million metric tons of grain a year from the United States.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 7 cents lower with December at $4.18{ a
bushel; corn was 3} cents to 7} cents lower with December at $2.57\
a bushel; oats were 10 cents lower across the board with December at
$2.05 a bushel; soybeans were 12\ cents to 16\ cents lower with
January at $7.49{ a bushel.
   Coffee futures plunged on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange on weakening technical signals, analysts said.
   Coffee settled 1.15 cents to 3.33 cents lower with March at
$1.2251 a pound.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .18 cent
to .48 cent lower with December at 73.27 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .33 cent lower to .15 cent higher with January at 82.45
cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
December at 39.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged
to .47 cent higher with February at 42.92 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 1.60 points higher at 268.95. Each point is worth
$500.

<HEAD>Plans To Divest 25 Brands, Close Plant, Eliminate Administrative
Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. announced plans
Monday to drop 25 non-premium liquor brands it markets in the United
States, close its Dundalk, Md., plant and eliminate 240 mostly
administrative jobs.
   The company, the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's Seagram Co. Ltd.,
said it was divesting the 25 brands so it could concentrate its
production and marketing resources on its more profitable,
nationally distributed premium brands.
   Seagram said it would discontinue production and sales of three
brands, cease acting as sales agent for four brands it does not own
and relinquish U.S. rights to 18 others, some of which Seagram will
continue to market in Canada and other international markets.
   The brands to be phased out represent about 8 percent of
Seagram's U.S. distilled spirits case sales and about 4 percent of
its earnings from that business. The phaseout will leave it with 23
U.S. brands.
   The planned closing of the Dundalk plant, which employs 300
people, will begin sometime after June 1 and be completed by the end
of 1990, Seagram said. It said the operations at Dundalk, where
various distilled spirits are made, will be transferred and
consolidated into other Seagram plants in the United States,
principally the facility at Relay, Md.
   Seagram said it had not been determined how many of those jobs
may be lost and how many employees will be offered transfers to
other plants.
   The company said its decision to eliminate the 240 positions,
most of them administrative, resulted from a review begun several
months ago of its U.S. operations. Seagram employs about 3,600
people in the United States.
   It said that of the positions being eliminated, 78 are vacant and
91 will involve separations through July 31. The remainder will be
eliminated through attrition, the company said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Monday approved
Bank of New York Co.'s $1.48 billion merger with Irving Bank Corp.,
removing the last formal obstacle to ending one of the nation's
lengthiest and most bitter takeover battles.
   The board, in a letter to H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney
representing Bank of New York, notified the bank to proceed with
consummation of the deal.
   The Fed had originally given conditional approval in February,
extending it four times as Irving unsuccessfully battled the
acquisition.
   The merger will nearly double Bank of New York's size, vaulting
it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies.
The two companies had a combined $47.8 billion in assets as of June

   The two banks ended their feud on Oct. 7 when Irving's board of
directors voted to abandon its resistance and drop all pending
lawsuits and anti-takeover defenses.
   In return, Bank of New York sweetened its previous hostile offer
by about $200 million by slightly increasing the stock portion of
the bid and adding stock warrants.

<HEAD>Trade Battle Looms over Hormones in Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the European Economic Community
have decided against having talks in Washington this week to explore
prospects for averting a trade battle over the EEC's scheduled Jan.
1 ban of meat from animals treated with growth hormones.
   ``They just saw the Americans the weekend before last and they'll
see them again in another week,'' said Ella Krucoff, speaking for
the community's delegation in Washington.
   U.S. producers stand to lose meat sales which totaled about $169
million last year in the 12 EEC nations, and administration
officials say President-elect George Bush could retaliate with
restrictions against the sale of European meat products, or even
some industrial products, in the United States.
   Patricia F. Stolfa of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service said the value of the European meat exports
to the United States is higher, because they include high quality
items like Danish ham. The U.S. market in Europe, on the other hand,
includes a large quantity of cheaper cuts such as hearts and
kidneys, she said.
   The use of hormones to speed animal growth is forbidden in the
EEC's member nations, which include West Germany, Britain, Italy,
Holland, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Spain, Portugal and Greece.
   However, there have been widespread reports of illegal use of
hormones by European producers and Ms. Stolfa suggested it could be
appropriate to delay the import ban while the European Parliament
completes an investigation already in progress.
   Earlier Monday, U.S. officials said imminent talks were possible
in Washington, and the EEC would be represented by Willy De Clercq,
a Belgian in charge of external affairs for the European Commission,
and Frans Andriessen, a Netherlander and top agricultural official.
   But they apparently decided to wait for a meeting in Montreal,
beginning Dec. 5, when U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng are due to review trade issues
with representatives of nearly 100 nations.
   Lester M. Crawford of the Food Safety and Inspection Service said
the hormones used on U.S. cattle do not leave residues that are
harmful to humans. He said scientists in Europe have supported the
U.S. position.
   The Reagan administration has proposed that international
decisions on the safety of hormones be entrusted to the Codex
Alimentarius Commission, a United Nations body with 129 governments
as members.

<HEAD>Railroad Giant to Pay Big Antitrust Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation giant Burlington Northern Inc. said
Monday it has agreed to pay more than $175 million to settle an
antitrust suit brought by pipeline Energy Transportation Systems,
ending a longstanding legal dispute.
   Energy Transportation had claimed Burlington Northern unlawfully
blocked construction of a proposed coal pipeline from the Powder
River Basin in Wyoming to Texas and Arkansas.
   Burlington Northern said $100 million cash would be paid to
Energy Transportation Dec. 1, and deferred payments of $25 million
plus interest on each of Dec. 1, 1989, 1990 and 1991 to the firm.
   A smaller settlement with another plaintiff in the suit, Houston
Lighting & Power, involves future rate adjustments.
   Don L. Pope, assistant vice president for corporate affairs, said
the settlement with Houston Lighting would be much less than the
larger settlement but declined to provide a figure.
   He also said Burlington Northern believed it had a good case but
settlement was prudent because damages in a federal jury trial could
have amounted to nearly $1 billion, with an award amount tripling
that figure because it was an antitrust action.
   ``We believe this is a very positive development,'' he said. ``It
will not impair the financial capability of the company.''
   BN stock was up $1.75 to $74.75 Monday in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   The lawsuit was over a project proposed in the 1970s that would
have sent coal on a line 1,400 miles from northeastern Wyoming to
utilities in Oklahoma and Texas. The coal would be crushed to a fine
powder and carried in a water slurry, then dried and burned in power
plants.

   United Telecommunications Inc. has received
authorization to become the general partner in its US Sprint joint
venture with GTE Corp., US Sprint said Monday.
   United Telecom and GTE announced in July that GTE would sell 30.1
percent of US Sprint to United Telecom, effective Jan. 3. That would
give United Telecom 80.1 percent of the nation's third-largest
long-distance company.
   The agreement also would give United Telecom the right to buy
GTE's remaining 19.9 percent interest in the venture through 1995.
   Under the petition approved by the Federal Communications
Commission, US Sprint Communications Co. will become US Sprint
Communications Co. Limited Partnership, which will be assigned all
of the joint venture's FCC authorizations, pending applications,
licenses and permits effective Jan. 3.

<HEAD>Cuomo: Study Pension Investment in Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo on Monday asked the trustee
for a $38 billion state pension fund to halt further investments in
corporate takeovers until a task force can determine if such deals
hurt the state economy.
   The Democratic governor appointed a 20-member task force to study
the issue and also Republican Comptroller Edward Regan's role as
sole trustee of New York's Common Retirement Fund.
   The Common Retirement Fund has $1 billion earmarked toward firms
involved in buyouts and $450 million actually committed, according
to Cuomo's economic development director, Vincent Tese.
   The bulk of the investments are with the buyout firms Forstman
Little & Co. and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co., said Regan
spokesman Marvin Nailor.
   Kohlberg Kravis is involved in the multibillion-dollar battle to
acquire over RJR Nabisco. The firm's role in the proposed buyout
already has been criticized by some of its other big institutional
investors, who claim some of their existing bond investments have
declined in value because of the huge amounts of new bonds needed to
finance RJR Nabisco deal.
   Tese called on Regan to impose a moratorium on further
investments in buyout firms until the task force issues its findings
in four months. Tese said he feared that many of these buyouts lead
to job cuts at the companies involved.
   ``The task force will examine the widespread concern about the
role of public pension funds in takeovers, which put our major
corporations deep into debt, and often exclude the interests of
bondholders and employees,'' Cuomo said.
   Regan called the study ``interesting,'' but suggested that
finding ways to close the state's $2 billion budget deficit was more
important. Nailor said the comptroller was considering Cuomo's
suggestion for a moratorium.
   The task force, which will be headed by Eugene Keilin, a partner
in the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres, also includes Tese;
Cuomo's chief counsel, Evan Davis; and budget director, Dall
Forsythe, who has been in charge of the Cuomo administration's
efforts to cut the budget deficit.
   The state's other two public employees pension funds, the New
York City Employees Retirement System and the State Teachers
Retirement Fund, don't invest in firms conducting takeovers, Tese
said.
   Cuomo long has advocated that state pension decisions be made by
a special board and not just the comptroller. Regan also has
supported creation of a pension board, but the comptroller's
proposal would allow him to appoint the panel's members.
   Tese said recent allegations about a possible link between
Regan's political fundraising apparatus and his official duties had
nothing to do with Cuomo's renewed call to limit the comptroller's
power.
   Regan has denied any wrongdoing.
