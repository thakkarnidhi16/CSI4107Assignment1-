   U2, the Irish rock group with a passion for
politics, picked up two Grammys Wednesday for ``The Joshua Tree,''
their 12-million selling album, and declared, ``This is just a
beginning.''
   Paul Simon won record of the year honors for ``Graceland,'' the
title track from his South African-inflected album which was the
Grammy album of the year last year.
   But Little Richard upstaged everyone as he hijacked the
nationally televised ceremony for several frantic moments,
declaring that he had won the Grammy for best new artist.
   ``I have never received nuthin' _ y'all never gave me no
Grammys, and I've been singing for years,'' declared the man who
sang ``Tutti Frutti'' and ``Good Golly, Miss Molly.''
   ``I am the architect of rock 'n' roll,'' he shouted, and the
crowd roared approval.
   After again announcing that he had, in fact, won the award,
Little Richard revealed the Academy's choice _ Jody Whatley, a
Madonna sound-alike from the old dance band, Shalamar.
   Whitney Houston, a winner two years ago with her debut album,
took honors at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards for best female pop
vocalist for her effervescent single, ``I Wanna Dance with
Somebody,'' from her LP, ``Whitney.''
   Narada Michael Walden won a Grammy for producing ``Whitney.''
   Bruce Springsteen won a combined male and female rock vocalist
category with ``Tunnel of Love.''
   ``Somewhere Out There,'' a sweet ballad written by veteran
songwriters James Horner, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil for the
animated film ``An American Tail,'' won as song of the year. ``We
wrote it for the mice,'' Weill said.
   Guitarist The Edge, born David Evans, pulled out a list as he
accepted the Grammy for best rock group with vocal ``The Joshua
Tree.'' He thanked luminaries such as Martin Luther King Jr.,
Amnesty International, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Morris the Cat, President Reagan and
college radio stations.
   After ``Joshua Tree'' won as album of the year, lead singer Bono
(Paul Hewson) quipped, ``It's really hard to carry the weight of
the world on your shoulders.''
   ``We don't see this as a peak for U2,'' Bono said backstage.
``It's just a beginning. We've got 12 songs ready for the next
album.''
   U2, Miss Houston, Los Lobos and Michael Jackson each had four
nominations this year, but none threatened threatened to equal
Jackson's eight-award sweep in the 1984 ceremony.
   And none had a prayer of overtaking Sir Georg Solti, conductor
of the Chicago Symphony, whose recording of Beethoven's 9th
Symphony won a Grammy for best orchestral recording and raised his
lifetime total to 26 Grammys.
   Vladimir Horowitz, the pianist who had 20 Grammys entering the
ceremonies, won two more for best classical instrumental
performance and best classical album for ``Horowitz in Moscow.'' He
also received the President's Special Merit Award from the Academy.
   ``I am so very happy the classical music still has an
appreciation,'' the fiery pianist told the crowd as he accepted the
special award. After he won the best album award, he simply smiled
and carried it away, saying nothing.
   Jackson's ``Bad'' album won an early Grammy, for best-produced
non-classical recording for producers Bruce Swedien and Humberto
Gatica.
   Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African vocal group featured
on Paul Simon's ``Graceland'' album, won a Grammy for themselves
for best traditional folk recording for ``Shaka Zulu.''
   Robert Shaw's recording of requiems by Gabriel Faure and Maurice
Durufle with the Atlanta Symphony Chorus and Orchestra won Grammys
for best engineered classical recording and for producer Robert
Woods. The Atlanta group's recording of Paul Hindemith's ``When
Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd'' won as best choral
performance.
   Frank Zappa's ``Jazz from Hell'' beat his son, Dweezil, and
Springsteen for best rock instrumental. ``Trio'' by Dolly Parton,
Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt won as best country vocal duo or
group performance.
   This year's show at Radio City Music Hall, televised by CBS,
saluted recordings released between Oct. 1, 1986 and Sept. 30,
1987, in 73 categories. Most awards were announced before the
broadcast began.
   The show accented the sounds of New York, where the Grammyfest
returned after seven years in Los Angeles. One of the big
production numbers featured the hot Latin rhythms of Tito Puente
and Celia Cruz, the funky rap of Run DMC and the urban ballads of
Billy Joel.
   Jackson, whose music swept up eight Grammys during a
``Thriller'' of a ceremony in 1984, was nominated for album of the
year for ``Bad.'' He was also up for male pop vocal performance for
the album and male rhythm 'n' blues vocal performance for the title
track. Jackson and Quincy Jones, who co-produced ``Bad,'' were
nominated in the producer category.
   Los Lobos, whose version of ``La Bamba'' was a bigger hit than
the original adaptation of the Mexican folk tune by the late
Ritchie Valens, were nominated for record of the year, song of the
year and best pop performane by a duo or group with vocal. The
group's ``By the Light of the Moon'' LP was nominated for best rock
performance by a duo or group with vocal.
   ``Whitney,'' Houston's second album, was nominated for album of
the year. She was nominated as best female pop vocalist for ``I
Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)'' and as best rhythm 'n'
blues female vocalist for ``For the Love of You.'' Another track
from the album, ``Didn't We Almost Have It All,'' was nominated as
song of the year for writers Michael Masser and Will Jennings.
   The winners were elected by ballots cast by members of the
National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences in seven chapters
around the nation. The academy's 6,000 members include recording
artists, songwriters, musicians, producers and technicians.
   There was no separate category this year for female rock
vocalist. The one nominee, Tina Turner, was included with Richard
Marx, Bob Seger, Bruce Springsteen and Joe Cocker in a category
combining male and female.
   Al Schlesinger, president of NARAS, said the academy has a rule
that members must nominate 10 people in a category for an award to
be presented.
   Kathleen Battle, the soprano who starred on four of the five
operas nominated for Grammys, ended up winning two _ the Vienna
Philharmonic recording of Richard Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos''
and her solo album, ``Salzburg REcital.''

<HEAD>Racial Tensions At Dartmouth Intensify With March, Rally</HEAD>

   About 200 people staged a candlelight march
at Dartmouth College on Wednesday night to protest as racist a
student newspaper's criticism of a black professor.
   Members of Dartmouth's Afro-American Society and others marched
down the Ivy League school's Fraternity Row without incident and
held a moment of silence on the campus green in the protest aimed
at the Dartmouth Review.
   The demonstration came a day after a federal judge dismissed a
lawsuit filed against the school by three former students involved
in a 1986 sledgehammer attack on anti-apartheid shanties.
   The former students wanted their college records cleared and the
school barred from ``intimidating or interfering'' with The
Dartmouth Review and staff members of the conservative student
weekly.
   In 1986, 12 students, mostly Review staffers, took sledgehammers
to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the campus green. The raid,
hours after a service marking the birthday of Martin Luther King
Jr., sparked a semester of turmoil.
   Racial tensions were revived last week with the Review's
stinging written attack on a black professor who once sued the
newspaper for libel.
   Four Review staffers now are charged by the school with
harassing professor William Cole after confronting him in his
classroom over the article, which criticized a music course he
teaches and his ability as a professor.
   Critics of the Review also plan a larger rally on Thursday.
   Three former Review staffers involved in the 1986 incident said
the shanty attack constituted ``symbolic speech'' similar to that
of the group that erected the shanties to protest Dartmouth
investments in companies doing business in South Africa.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Shane Devine dismissed the
lawsuit, deciding that the students failed to prove that their
rights were violated.
   The suit was filed by Deborah Stone of Keene, Frank Reichel of
Philadelphia, Teresa Polenz of Katonah, N.Y., and the company that
publishes the Review.
   The four Review staffers now charged with harassing Cole face a
college disciplinary hearing on Tuesday and possible expulsion.
   The staffers say are being persecuted for taking strong stands
on the quality of Dartmouth life and education, and deny that race
is a factor. The Afro-American Society believes the Review
contributes to racial problems at Dartmouth.

<HEAD>Delta Air Lines Case Against U.S. Government Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines' suit blaming federal
agencies for the fiery crash of a Delta jet that killed 137 people
went to trial Tuesday with both sides accusing the other of
negligence.
   ``The Delta crew played Russian roulette with the lives of their
passengers,'' said Kathlynn Fadely, a government attorney, during
opening arguments in the complex case.
   Flight 191 crashed and exploded into flames Aug. 2, 1985, as it
headed toward a Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport runway
during a storm. The 137 dead included the driver of a car that was
hit as the plane plunged downward. Twenty-five people were injured.
   In his opening statement, Delta attorney John Martin said the
government is to blame, arguing that the Federal Aviation
Administration tower and the National Weather Sevice failed to warn
the flight crew of the severity of a weather system at the airport.
   He said the Delta flight happened to be at the wrong place at
the wrong time and air traffic control completely broke down at
D-FW when the crash occured.
   But Fadely said the crew didn't listen to warnings from the
control tower and flew into the storm system.
   A report by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded
that the crash was caused, in part, by the pilot's decision to fly
into a wind shear, a violent downdraft.
   The trial of Delta's claims against the government, delayed six
months from its original date, seeks to determine who is to blame
for the crash and may also decide how much can be recovered in
damages.
   The decision also will determine whether the government must pay
part of $91.2 million in claims that Delta's insurers have paid so
far in connection with the crash.
   In December, about 90 lawsuits filed by individuals against
Delta were parceled out from federal court in Fort Worth to other
U.S. District courts. Judge David O. Belew Jr. ruled that lawsuits
filed by passengers' families will be sent back to the courts where
they were originally filed.
   About half of those 90 suits have been settled.
   The non-jury trial between the airline and the government could
last up to three months and could include testimony from any of 550
potential fact and expert witnesses named by the two sides.

   A bill to ban swimming and restrict other
recreation at Walden Pond, the retreat idealized by Henry David
Thoreau in 1845, has sunk in the Legislature.
   The Natural Resources Committee declined Tuesday to adopt a bill
that would eliminate a manmade sand beach, restrict fishing and
boating and require construction of sound barriers beside roadways
near the pond in Concord, 15 miles west of Boston.
   Mary Sherwood, whose group Walden Forever Wild Inc. opposes
continued recreation at Walden, contends that 50 years of public
recreation at the pond have endangered its fragile banks and
spoiled a pristine site.
   But Department of Environmental Management Commissioner James
Gutensohn told the committee, ``I'm sure the Indians swam at Walden
Pond, I'm sure Henry David Thoreau swam at Walden Pond and I'm sure
the people of Boston should.''
   The 62-acre pond, in a 333-acre state-owned reservation, has
350,000 visitors a year.

<HEAD>Israel Considering Closing Territories To Journalists</HEAD>

   Government leaders concerned about Israel's
battered image abroad are arguing increasingly in favor of barring
journalists from the occupied territories after nearly three months
of violent protests there.
   Most of Israel's 24 Cabinet ministers support closing the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to journalists as long as the unrest persists,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said after attending a Cabinet
session where the issue was raised this week.
   Closing areas to reporters ``is done in various countries around
the world where confrontations of this sort take place,'' said
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``If it becomes clear that indeed it may limit the damage, I
would be willing to consider it,'' he said.
   The executive committee of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc voted
unanimously Monday evening that journalists should be banned from
entering the territories.
   West Bank army commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna reissued
instructions to field commanders to close areas to reporters for
several hours if they believe it is necessary to keep or restore
calm, army officials told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   But Shamir's government partner, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
of the centrist Labor Party, warned against further restrictions.
   ``If we were to close off the area, in my opinion, rumors of
atrocities would be spread around the world that we would not be
able to refute,'' Peres said.
   ``Israel is an open society and a free society and even if
(journalists) are not always pleasant, we have to allow them to
fulfill their jobs,'' he told reporters Tuesday.
   Other officials oppose closing the territories on the grounds
that such a move might fuel comparisons between Israel and South
Africa, an issue about which Israel has been particularily
sensitive.
   South African police, like Israeli army officers, have the
discretion to declare an area closed to media on the spot because
of unrest. Journalists then are barred from entry and must leave if
already there.
   Cable News Network's bureau chief Robert Wiener said Israeli
soldiers seized videotape last week from a crew which photographed
a Palestinian hanging dead from a pole in the village of Qabatiyeh
after his neighbors lynched him because he was suspected of
collaborating with the Israelis.
   The army was criticized afterward for failing to rescue the
Palestinian. Wiener said the soldiers detained the CNN crew for
three hours and refused to return the videotape, saying it
contained material damaging to Israel's security.
   The Israeli military command said Tuesday that ``our policy is
to keep the administered territories open to journalists. However
there are exceptions to the rule in isolated incidents where
certain troublesome areas can be closed.''
   The latest debate over media access was triggered by a CBS News
report last week that showed four Israeli soldiers beating two
captive Palestinians.
   The two were beaten for more than half an hour while a CBS
cameraman photographed it surreptitiously. After the footage was
broadcast, embassies in the United States and Europe received many
complaints and Jewish communities abroad also expressed concern,
Foreign Ministry officials said.
   The four soldiers are being investigated, the army said. The CBS
office in Tel Aviv has received anonymous threatening telephone
calls, said CBS bureau chief Terry Plantinga.
   ``One more incident like the CBS film and the territories will
be closed to journalists,'' a government official told The AP on
condition of anonymity.
   Rabin met Monday with a delegation from the Foreign Press
Association and said most Cabinet ministers supported blocking
journalists from entering the territories but he did not, according
to FPA chairman Robert Slater.
   ``The voices in favor of closing the territories have become
much louder than the others,'' Slater said. ``It appears more
likely than ever before that such a step will be taken and the FPA
is increasingly worried.''
   Two Israeli newspapers, the left-wing Al Hamishmar and the
independent Maariv, ran editorials Tuesday criticizing discussions
in government circles about closing the territories to journalists.
   ``Without media in the territories we may live in a warm
comfortable bubble next to an erupting volcano,'' Al Hamishmar
said. ``But we will be caught by surprise and off guard when the
lava overflows and threatens our very existence.''

   Sarah, the Duchess of York, better known
as ``Fergie,'' has received a scolding from a suburban Chicago
dermatologist who contends her visits to a tanning parlor set a bad
example.
   The former Sarah Ferguson who is married to Britain's Prince
Andrew is especially prone to sun damage because of her fair
complexion and Celtic ancestry, said Dr. Michael Greenberg.
   Greenberg said he wrote to the duchess after reading in People
magazine about her tanning parlor visits.
   ``I am astounded that an intelligent woman such as yourself
would, first consent to tan her skin considering the increase in
skin cancer caused by ultraviolet (rays) and, second, let yourself
be an example for the millions of ordinary, gullible women who
follow whatever a member of the royal family does as though it were
gospel,'' Greenberg wrote.
   The duchess and her husband, both 28, are on a 10-day visit to
California. They are expecting their first child in August.
   ``I think she would be grateful for his concern,'' said Francis
Cornish, a spokesman for the British Consulate in Los Angeles,
which delivered the letter Tuesday to the duchess' private
secretary.
   The duchess and her husband plan to leave Los Angeles on Friday
for a two-day stay in the desert resort Palm Springs, Calif.,
before heading back to Britain, Cornish said.

<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities have crushed efforts at
peaceful dissent by the nationalist monks of Tibet as swiftly as
they did last year's bold and violent protests by the Buddhist holy
men.
   Hundreds of monks boycotted the opening of a prayer festival, in
the first major clash of wills since at least 14 people were killed
in a demonstration Oct. 1.
   By the second day, however, a major monastery that led the
boycott yielded to Chinese pressure and sent more than 200 monks to
the festival, other monks reported. Official media had called the
gathering a sign of normality in the troubled Himalayan region.
   ``The monks didn't want to come,'' one holy man whispered at the
Jokhang Temple in central Lhasa, where the prayer festival began
last Thursday and continued this week.
   They finally did, he said, because ``they were afraid _ afraid
that the police will grab them.'' He glanced over his shoulder at
an approaching plainclothes policeman, one of dozens patrolling the
temple.
   Fear remains the primary legacy of the three pro-independence
demonstrations led by monks over a two-week period in September and
October in Lhasa, the mile-high Tibetan capital whose name means
``holy ground.''
   The monks dispute China's claim to sovereignty and want
independence under the leadership of their exiled god-king, the
Dalai Lama.
   Chinese authorities have removed all remnants of a police
station near the Jokhang Temple that was burned Oct. 1 by hundreds
of angry monks and lay Tibetans, prompting police to fire on the
crowd. A new stone building is being built on the site.
   Military roadblocks have been removed from outside the three
main monasteries in the Lhasa area _ Sera, Drepung and Ganden _ and
police who were billeted inside the monasteries have been
withdrawn. Plainclothes Chinese agents now keep watch.
   All but 15 of the 80 people arrested during the protests have
been released from jail after repenting, according to official
reports.
   The prayer festival, called Moinlam Qenmo, has been held at
Jokhang Temple every year since 1409 except for the period 1960-85,
when it was banned by China. It gathers monks from the Lhasa area
for eight days of continuous prayer and is one of the the most
important Tibetan Buddhist events.
   As a precaution, Beijing sent the highest-ranking Tibetan
Buddhist leader in China, the Panchen Lama, to Tibet in early
February to persuade monks to cooperate.
   He is regarded as second in prestige only to the Dalai Lama, who
fled to India nine years after the Chinese army entered Tibet in
1950.
   ``The Panchen Lama said `Don't demonstrate,''' said a
20-year-old monk at the Sera Monastery, whose whitewashed stone
buildings cling to a mountainside on the southern fringe of the
city.
   ``Some (monks) said OK, but some were quiet, didn't answer,'' he
said, gathering his blood-red robes against a chill wind.
   Their answer came Thursday, when fewer than 600 showed up in
Jokhang's silk-draped central courtyard for the opening of the
prayer festival, which attracted more than 1,000 monks last year.
   Those attending quickly spread the word: ``Not one monk from
Ganden is here.''
   A monk from Sera said the holy men of Ganden stayed away because
``the situation is not good. Too many Chinese are here; too many
police.'' Other monks said the same.
   Sera and Drepung sent fewer monks than usual, and those who
remained at Drepung conducted their own, small-scale prayer
festival.
   ``We're afraid of the police,'' said one boycotter at Drepung.
``It's a very big festival, but if we make a small mistake we will
be in trouble.''
   In addition to plainclothes officers inside, uniformed police
were stationed every few yards around the whitewashed stone Jokhang
Temple, which is the size of a city block.
   Several policemen watched from the roof of a nearby police
building and others photographed foreign visitors, some of the few
allowed into Tibet since the protests last year.
   The Ganden monks finally arrived quietly Thursday night from
their home on a holy mountain 35 miles west of Lhasa. Their
presence brought to nearly 800 the number of monks who sat
cross-legged most of the day in the stone courtyard, chanting.
   A stream of pilgrims, including herdsmen in tattered furs, edged
around the courtyard and spooned offerings of butter into lamps
that flickered in racks along the wall.
   Tibetan sources and Westerners who have seen previous festivals
said there were fewer pilgrims, as well as monks, this year.
   One Tibetan said Lhasa's population of 40,000 usually doubled
with the influx of monks and pilgrims during Moinlam Qenmo. No
count of pilgrims was available because most stay only a few days
and sleep in the streets.
   China's official media said festival attendance was up, from
1,100 monks and pilgrims last year to more than 2,300.
   Dozens of Chinese reporters wrote of the event and the official
news agency Xinhua quoted local authorities as saying: ``Last
year's riot has not had any impact on the ceremony.''
   Monks who stayed behind at the the Ganden monastery, which was
leveled by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and is
only partially restored, were not allowed to talk freely to
visitors.
   Of more than a dozen monks interviewed at the Jokhang Temple and
at Sera, Drepung and smaller monasteries, none expressed regret for
the violence of the protests. All were emphatic in disdain for the
Chinese.
   ``Chinese are no good,'' a 12-year-old novice monk said in
English. ``But we are not afraid.''
   A lay Tibetan said: ``Tibet had its own culture, its own
religion, its own border guards. How can they say we are one
country?''

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danny the Red, leader of student
revolts in France and West Germany in the 1960s, jokingly says he
was never quite as leftist as his nickname implied.
   ``They only meant my hair color,'' said Daniel Cohn-Bendit,
referring to his rust-colored hair during an interview in his
Frankfurt office. ``I've always been an anti-Communist, more of one
than Reagan.''
   He's now 42 years old and an active member of West Germany's
anti-establishment, environmentalist Greens Party _ the moderate
wing _ and publishes a left-leaning regional magazine in Frankfurt.
   He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Frankfurt in 1986 in a purely
symbolic move, he said. But he is considering seriously running for
Frankfurt's city council next year.
   Cohn-Bendit has also become an author. A collection of
interviews with other 1960s activists around the world was
published in West Germany in September.
   American activists featured in the book include Jerry Rubin and
Abbie Hoffmann, leading Yippies of the era, and the Black Panther
activist, Bobby Seale.
   The book, ``We Loved It So, The Revolution,'' portrays Rubin as
a Yippie-turned-Yuppie and Seale as hoping for commercial success
as a cookbook author.
   His book isn't the only look back: West Germany's news media
have carried numerous articles on the tumultuous times of 1968.
   Cohn-Bendit said that he has basically remained true to many
views he had 20 years ago.
   ``I believe that I can still legitimize everything I do from my
standpoint in 1968,'' Cohn-Bendit said.
   As a moderate member of the Greens, Cohn-Bendit favors forming
coalitions with West Germany's liberal Social Democratic Party,
which the Greens' radical wing opposes. Nor does Cohn-Bendit favor
a West German withdrawal from NATO, as some of the radicals do.
   ``West German militarization is more dangerous on its own than
embedded in a larger context,'' he said. ``That's the lesson of
World War II.''
   Cohn-Bendit has always been a figure who defied traditional
national, political, and religious labels. He was born in
Montauban, France, on April 4, 1945, the son of German Jews who
fled Hitler's persecution in the 1930s.
   His parents moved to West Germany when Cohn-Bendit was 13. In
1961 Cohn-Bendit became a West German citizen.
   ``I did it only for pragmatical reasons,'' he said. ``I didn't
want to serve in the military.''
   Jews whose parents or siblings were persecuted under the Nazis
are by West German law exempted from the country's mandatory
military service.
   Cohn-Bendit, who speaks French and German fluently, said he
doesn't assign his national identify to either country. As a French
citizen, he would have been subject to the military draft in France.
   ``I'm just me. I'm not German or French,'' he added. ``I don't
need a national definition.''
   Cohn-Bendit's views have led to occasional flaps with
Frankfurt's Jewish community. In a highly publicized dispute in
1985 he publicly supported the city playhouse in presenting a play
by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, which many Jews wanted banned as
anti-Semitic.
   In the Feb. 18 issue of his magazine ``Pflasterstrand,''
Cohn-Bendit described himself as a ``convinced anti-Zionist.''
   In the interview, he said he favored the existence of Israel but
also a separate Palestinian state and ``a limitation of Zionism.''
   Tenants' housing rights and terrorist amnesty are among other
issues that have made Cohn-Bendit a household name.
   But the era that propelled the activist to world fame, the
1960s, is a topic Cohn-Bendit said he no longer wants to talk a lot
about.
   In his book, originally published in France, he writes that
people have used him ``like a machine that turns back time.''
   Cohn-Bendit captured world attention as a university student in
France, at a time when youth protests were rocking the globe.
   He was a spokesman for students whose demands included greater
social equality and an end to war, in Vietnam and elsewhere. Danny
the Red became the leader of Paris' tumultuous _ and occasionally
bloody _ student revolts.
   ``We had the will to change our lives, to participate in history
right at the moment it happened,'' Cohn-Bendit writes of his
revolutionary days.
   In May 1968 French authorities expelled him from the country on
grounds of disturbing the peace. The ban was not officially lifted
until 1978,Cohn-Bendit wrote in his book.
   Cohn-Bendit lives with his girl friend, but he said he doesn't
intend to get married.

<HEAD>Colon Cancer Risk Tied To Acid Rain Pollutants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elevated rates of colon cancer in the nation's
Northeast and north-central region may be due to an acid rain
pollutant that absorbs sunlight, impairing the body's ability to
make vitamin D, reseachers say.
   Preliminary studies have suggested that vitamin D and calcium
combine to lower the risk of colon cancer.
   According to the new theory, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere
absorbs ultraviolet rays from the sun that trigger the production
of vitamin D in the skin, researchers said at a press conference
Tuesday.
   Sulfur dioxide, produced by the burning of high-sulfur coal, is
a principal ingredient of acid rain.
   A similar effect was observed in London more than 350 years ago,
said the originators of the new theory, said Cedric Garland of the
University of California, San Diego and his brother, Frank, of the
Naval Health Research Center in San Diego.
   Around 1629, Londoners began burning high-sulfur coal from
Newcastle, they said. Within a short time, children began
exhibiting the leg malformations characteristic of rickets _ a
vitamin D deficiency disease.
   Vitamin D aids the absorption of calcium, and calcium and
vitamin D together appear to lower the risk of colon cancer, the
Garlands said.
   Dr. Martin Lipkin of New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center said the Garlands' theory ``is a legitimate theory'' and
work is in progress to clarify the role of vitamin D and calcium in
colon cancer.
   ``We're looking into how many individuals might be benefited by
calcium _ and the degree to which they might be,'' said Lipkin. Two
years ago, he showed that calcium supplements could change the
growth of cells in the colons of people at high risk of colon
cancer and might therefore lower colon cancer risk.
   An authority on diet and cancer, Regina Ziegler of the National
Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., cautioned that because this was
only a theory, people should not begin taking vitamin D supplements
to protect against colon cancer.
   ``People have trouble distinguishing theories from proven
effects,'' she said. ``With evidence such as this, you certainly
don't want to start taking large doses of vitamin D. Vitamin D in
high doses can be hazardous to your health.''
   The Garlands' explanation is not the only theory to explain why
colon cancer rates are highest in the north-central and
northeastern states.
   ``Other people have hypothesized that increased exercise,
increased fruit and vegetable intake and differences in drinking
water may lead to the lower incidence in the South,'' said Ziegler.
   The Garlands cautioned that people should not spend more time in
the sun to increase their vitamin D production because exposure to
sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer. They suggested instead
that people eat foods high in vitamin D, which include anchovies,
sardines, salmon and tuna. Milk is fortified with vitamin D, but
most other dairy products are not, they said.
   Breast cancer also occurs at an increased rate in the areas
where colon cancer is highest, and the Garlands suggested that
breast cancer, too, might be indirectly related to sulfur dioxide
in the atmosphere. That theory is more speculative than the colon
cancer theory, Frank Garland said.

   Courtney Gibbs became the fourth Texan in
a row to win the Miss USA crown Tuesday, besting Miss California in
the nationally televised pageant.
   ``It feels fabulous,'' Ms. Gibbs, 21, said moments after being
crowned by her predecessor and fellow Texan, Michelle Royer. ``One
of the gifts Michelle gave me was a dictionary with the word
`impossible' whited out. So of course it was possible.''
   Ms. Gibbs, of Fort Worth, won the right to compete in the Miss
Universe pageant May 23 in Taiwan. Ms. Royer, of Keller, came in
third in last year's worldwide competition, which was won by Miss
Chile.
   The blue-eyed brunette, a junior in advertising and public
relations at Texas Christian University, won over Diana Magana, 22,
of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., the first runner-up.
   Miss USA spokeswoman Stacy Sacco said she was stunned by the
fourth Miss Texas victory in a row. ``What are the odds?'' she said.
   Second runner-up was Miss Georgia, Donna Rampy, 24, followed by
Miss Florida, Monica Bruni Farrell, 23, and Miss Mississippi, Dana
Michele Richmond, 20.
   Soon after the beaming new Miss USA ascended her throne, the
last three title holders posed with her for photographers.
   Ms. Royer's predecessor, Christie Fichtner of Dallas, called the
last four winners ``four aces in a deck of cards.''
   The woman who started the string, Laura Martinez-Herring of El
Paso, said: ``It's always been known Texas is full of beautiful
women, and this just proves it. I just feel sorry for the next Miss
Texas.''
   Actress Tracy Scoggins and actor Alan Thicke served as co-hosts
for the program, televised by CBS. Ten semifinalists, who had been
chosen last week, were announced as the pageant opened Tuesday
night.
   The pageant capped three bizarre weeks in which two contestants
quit because of police records, animal-rights activists protested
the awarding of fur coats and the co-host, Miss Scoggins, was
attacked in a hotel elevator.
   The hosts made no mention of the various problems during the
television show.
   The late departures of two contestants, both from Minnesota,
opened a spot for Julie Nelson, 20, of Minneapolis, but the
lateness meant she arrived about a week after the other contestants.
   ``Actually, I've found this oddball situation to be quite an
advantage,'' she said before the pageant opened. ``Having so short
a time to pull myself together, getting all my clothes together,
finding a fur coat, dropping everything _ when all the other girls
had months to prepare. It shows off my abilities.''
   Miss Nelson was not among the 10 semifinalists.

   Besides a mink jacket and full-length coat worth a total of
$15,000, Miss USA wins a $25,000 personal appearance contract,
$46,000 cash, a sports car, $10,000 worth of jewelry and other
prizes, including a portable home tanning center.
   About 25 animal-rights activists picketed Tuesday outside the El
Paso Convention Center to protest the awarding of the furs to the
winner.
   Members of the El Paso and Las Cruces, N.M., chapters of Sangre
de Cristo Animal Rights contend fur ranching and trapping are cruel
to the animals.
   Bob Young, director of Sangre de Cristo's Las Cruces chapter,
had asked Thicke to do as longtime host Bob Barker had done
earlier: resign in protest over the awarding of the furs.
   Thicke refused, saying the furs were taken from ranch-raised
minks that had been treated humanely. He and Young released a joint
statement Monday saying they agreed that fur-trapping is cruel but
disagreed on fur-ranching.
   In another prepageant incident, a man accused of attempted
sexual assault in the attack on Miss Scoggins last week was
released on $100 bail. Prosecutors usually ask for $15,000 bail in
third-degree felonies like attempted sexual assaults.
   A man ripped Miss Scoggins' dress and shoved her into the back
of a hotel elevator, authorities said. She fought the man off and a
man was arrested at the hotel.
   The man's bail was later raised to $100,000, which he posted.
   Another person connected with the pageant has a date with the
law. Suzanne Pitman, Miss Kentucky-USA, is awaiting trial on
drunken-driving charges.
   Two other contestants with arrest records, both from Minnesota
and both accused of shoplifting, elected to bow out.
   The original Miss Minnesota-USA, Sue Bolich, resigned after it
was disclosed she'd been accused of shoplifting $370 worth of
clothing. Her replacement, first runner-up Jolene Stavrakis, quit
after disclosing she had pleaded no contest to stealing from a
store in March 1986.
   The first Miss USA pageant was in 1952 in Long Beach, Calif.

<HEAD>Most Democratic ``Super Delegates'' Not Yet Backing Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three-fourths of the Democratic Party leaders
who will be national convention delegates are not yet supporting
any of the presidential candidates as the initial round of
primaries and caucuses draws to a close, an Associated Press survey
found.
   Since late last year, the candidates together have attracted
support that will add up to fewer than three dozen votes at the
convention, according to the survey, in which hundreds of the
party's ``super delegates'' were contacted.
   And despite the months of debates and the weeks of primaries and
caucuses, many of the automatic delegates, who include Democratic
National Committee members, Democratic governors and others, are
not closing in on which candidate they plan to suppport.
   ``The more I hear, the more uncommitted I become,'' said Ruth
Moss, a Democratic National Committee member from Maine.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the winner of the New
Hampshire primary, leads the pack with commitments totaling just
31.5 votes at the convention. By comparison, the runaway favorite
so far is ``uncommitted,'' a category in which delegates with
247.65 votes at the convention place themselves, the AP survey
found.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, winner of the Iowa caucuses, is
next behind Dukakis with commitments amounting to 21 votes at the
convention, followed by Jesse Jackson with 19.55, Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore with 16.55 and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 15.5.
   Only Gary Hart, who has acknowledged his chances of winning the
Democratic nomination are remote at best, has not received a
commitment from any of the delegates contacted by the AP.
   When added to delegates won by the candidates in the primaries
and caucuses so far, that brings the total to 63.5 for Dukakis, 47
for Gephardt, 35.5 for Simon, 27.55 for Jackson, 16.55 for Gore and
none for Hart. A total of 258.65 are counted as uncommitted.
   The survey, conducted during the last two weeks of February,
indicates that the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary,
along with nearly weekly debates, have made little impression on
Democratic Party leaders. The survey found that just 35.25 more
convention votes have been won by the candidates since a similar AP
survey late last year.
   ``I'm still not convinced that Iowa and New Hampshire are
representative of the cross section of the United States,'' said
New Mexico party chairman Sam Pick.
   ``Call over to the grammar school and talk to any first-grader _
he knows just as much as I do,'' said J.T. Rose, a DNC member from
Arkansas. ``It's up for grabs. I'm just sitting back enjoying it.''
   That's not what the Gephardt campaign had hoped to hear after
the victory in Iowa.
   ``I think we expected a bigger bounce,'' said Jude Barry, a
Gephardt campaign aide who works on delegate selection. ``We would
like people to commit sooner, but we're encouraged by what they're
telling us.''
   Rick Hutcheson, a Gore campaign aide involved in delegate
selection, said he is not surprised to see the super delegates
holding back.
   ``These are political people; they want to wait and see what the
voters in the primaries decide and then they will exercise their
judgment,'' he said.
   However, Barry said party leaders may feel some incentive to
begin committing themselves after next week's Super Tuesday
contests, when nearly one-third of the party's delegates are at
stake.
   ``At that point I think that people start looking at the
calendar,'' Barry said. ``People who come in after New York (which
holds an April 19 primary) are really going to be seen as coming
late to the party.''
   The Democratic Party allots 362 convention votes to members of
its national committee, some of whom will cast only fractions of
votes. An additional 25 votes are given to governors of states and
territories and five to former leaders, including former President
Carter and Walter Mondale, a former vice president who was the
party's nominee in 1984.
   Delegates representing 352.75 convention votes were contacted
for the AP survey in February.
   An additional 253 delegate slots will be awarded to Democratic
members of Congress in April.
   The Republican Party makes no such provision for automatic
delegates, awarding all the seats to its national convention
through the primaries and caucuses.
   In all, 4,162 delegates are to attend the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta July 18-21, and 2,082 are needed to win the
presidential nomination.

   That masterpiece of music comedy and nostalgic
Americana, ``The Music Man,'' suffered from a lack of strong, clear
singing as the New York City Opera opened its annual season of
musical comedy.
   The acting, directing, dancing and scenery were first-rate
Tuesday at the New York State Theater. But some of the verve and
excitement of those glorious, fast-paced songs was lost during the
first act as the singing did not carry well over the orchestra.
   The problem was alleviated after intermission. Perhaps it was
the shift to mostly ballads, or perhaps the level of the singers'
microphones had been boosted, but Act 2 was the rich, delightful
experience one hopes the whole show will be for the rest of its run
through April 10.
   Bob Gunton, debuting with the company as Harold Hill, had the
most trouble. A Broadway performer, he moves as gracefully as a
dancer and sold his ``76 Trombones'' to the folks of River City
with more charm than brass. But his light voice didn't project in
Act 1's ``Ya Got Trouble'' and ``The Sadder but Wiser Girl.''
   The female chorus also was difficult to understand in
``Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little,'' and the townspeople blurred the
words of joyful anticipation in ``The Wells Fargo Wagon.'' David
Burdick, smaller than most boys who play the lisping Winthrop, also
is no belter, and didn't get his words across the footlights.
   Opera singers learn to project their voices and they came out
best, making themselves understood and never sounding too operatic
for the music. Leigh Munro was a pretty and sympathetic Marian the
librarian, Muriel Costa-Greenspon a natural leader of ladies as the
mayor's wife, Richard McKee as the pompous mayor, James Billings as
Harold Hill's cohort, Brooks Almy as Marian's mother and William
Ledbetter as the constable.
   The dancing chorus was splendid, with choreography by Marcia
Milgrom Dodge, making her company debut. There's a generous amount
of dancing, in the library, in rehearsals for a ``social,'' in the
center of town several times. David Jenkins' set of business
buildings pulled back to give the dancers room. Andrew Marlay's
costumes for 1912 were glorious, from feathered hats to peppermint
suits for the four school board members who squabbled every minute
they weren't harmonizing ``Lida Rose.''
   Donald Pippin, a Broadway conductor, was conducting at the New
York City Opera for the first time. It was wonderful to hear the
overture played by a big orchestra, less wonderful later when words
were covered.
   The late Meredith Willson wrote the book, music and lyrics. He
and Frank Lacey wrote the plot, which came out as a memory of
bygone innocent days of Mason City, Iowa, where Willson grew up.
One wonderful song follows another _ ``Goodnight, My Someone,''
``My White Knight,'' ``Till There Was You'' _ and the audience
greeted each gem like a reunion with a long-lost best friend.

<HEAD>Administration Officials Praise Fed Monetary Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is trying to soften
earlier accusations that the Federal Reserve's tight monetary
policies are nudging the country toward a recession.
   In separate forums, a trio of Reagan administration officials
said Tuesday they believe the nation's central bank is doing a good
job of supplying money to the economy.
   Just a few weeks ago, administration officials worried about the
prospect of a recession during an election year had been
complaining that the Fed wasn't pumping enough new money into the
economy.
   On Tuesday, however, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told
the Senate Appropriations Committee that he has ``absolutely no
disagreement'' with the Fed's monetary policy.
   Speaking at the National Press Club, Budget Director James C.
Miller III said, ``There seems to be a little bit of easing, and I
welcome that.''
   And at a meeting of the National Association of Business
Economists, Beryl Sprinkel, President Reagan's chief economic
adviser, said the administration is ``supportive of present policy
as well as the plans for the future'' the Fed revealed last week.
   The suddenly conciliatory administration tone follows a sharp
counterattack by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, who had responded to
the administration complaints with some pointed remarks of his own.
   Greenspan said that a looser monetary policy could spark higher
inflation. He also said pressure by the administration could push
the Fed into asserting its independence by doing the opposite of
what the White House wanted.
   The administration began pulling back from its criticisms last
week. Sprinkel said he supports the Fed's policies so far in 1988,
and Reagan said at his news conference last Wednesday that he had
confidence in Greenspan, whom he appointed to the Fed job last
summer.
   The central bank can usually increase the flow of credit by
easing interest rates.
   Baker told the senators Tuesday that when it comes to finding
the balance between keeping interest rates low and avoiding
inflation, ``I think the Fed is doing that and doing a very good
job of that.''
   In other testimony, Baker played down concerns raised by
senators about the growth of the national debt.
   Projections by the Congressional Budget Office, cited at the
hearing, are that the national debt could reach $4 trillion by
1993. The debt was below $1 trillion when Reagan took office in
1981.
   ``There are some risks in the growth of debt of this magnitude,
but I think they tend to be overstated,'' Baker said. ``I think to
some extent that's a consequence of the fact that we're moving into
1988, which happens to be an election year.''
   Baker also said, however, that ``an increase in the debt is not
a development about which this administration nor the Congress can
be very happy.''

<HEAD>Head of Comedie Francaise Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Comedie Francaise, actor and director
Jean Le Poulain, died Tuesday night. He was 63.
   Le Poulain died at his home on the Avenue de l'Opera, near the
famed theater he had administered for the past two years. No cause
of death was given.
   ``It is the theater of yesterday and today which cannot,
tonight, hide its tears,'' Culture Minister Francois Leotard said
in a statement. ``The curtain of the (Comedie) Francaise has fallen
on a great voice.''
   Le Poulain had been a member of the Comedie Francaise since 1979
and was placed in charge in 1986.
   During his 40-year career in the theater, he acted in and
directed dozens of plays from the classics to contemporary pieces.
   ``With his disappearance, French theater loses one of its most
brilliant servants, an inheritor of the tradition of the Comedie
Francaise, that which runs from Moliere to Jacques Charron,''
Leotard's statement said.
   Le Poulain was born in Marseille Sept. 12, 1924, but spent much
of his childhood in Cambodia, where his father worked.
   Returning to France at the age of 19, he studied at the Paris
Conservatory, which he left in 1949 with the first prize in acting.
   In 1952, he founded his own theater company, directing a variety
of plays from Shakespeare to Jean Anouilh.
   Le Poulain was known to the public as both a buffoon and a
tragedien, but he received the most acclaim for his portrayals in
the plays of Moliere, such as ``Tartuffe'' and ``Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme.''
   After taking over the Comedie Francaise, as the candidate
proposed by President Francois Mitterrand, Le Poulain neither acted
nor directed. He said he concentrated his time to running the
institution _ ``I am the protector of its soul.''

<HEAD>U.S. Warns Mexico and Colombia on Drug Running</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarmed by a rise in drug production and the
violence that goes with it, the Reagan administration is warning
Colombia and Mexico that their anti-narcotics programs will receive
close scrutiny in the coming months.
   They were singled out Tuesday in the president's annual drug
report to Congress as countries that are making some efforts to
stop narcotics traffic but need to improve.
   They were not classed with Iran, Afghanistan, Syria and a new
entry on the list, Panama, as countries whose support for drug
trafficking makes them ineligible for U.S. aid.
   Ann Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said the message to Colombia and Mexico is: ``We
believe that you're cooperating and you deserve certification, but
we want to put an asterisk next to it and we will be watching
closely in 1988.''
   In the annual report to Congress, the president certifies
whether countries are doing enough to battle narcotics to deserve
U.S. assistance and other benefits.
   Panama made the list this year because its military chief and de
facto leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, has been indicted by a U.S.
grand jury on drug conspiracy charges. Panama is not a major
narcotics producing country, but according to Wrobleski, ``Panama
has been a drug traffickers' and money launderers' haven.''
   Putting Panama on the list will have no immediate impact,
because the country had lost U.S. aid even before Noriega's
indictment. But Tuesday's action does permit further steps by the
administration, including some tariffs and tightening of customs
rules that could hurt Panamanian exports.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said he would introduce
legislation to go further by imposing a trade embargo on Panama.
   ``The good news is that Panama is on the list,'' said Sen.
Lawton Chiles, D-Fla. ``On the other hand, Mexico and Colombia
aren't. ... I think we have to continue to apply pressure against
these countries.''
   The president's report faulted Colombia for not breaking a
cartel of drug dealers and for not fully backing U.S. requests for
extradition of drug suspects wanted in the United States. At the
same time, it noted that whatever efforts Colombia made in the
fight were ``at great peril to its officials.''
   It said Mexico is the largest single source of heroin and
marijuana entering the United States, and officials there need to
do more to eradicate opium poppies and deal with allegations of
official corruption.
   Three countries said to be doing little to stop narcotics
escaped inclusion on the list due to special ``national security
concerns,'' the report said.
   Laos was kept off the list out of concern that a condemnation
would harm U.S. efforts to win Laotian help in accounting for more
than 500 U.S. servicemen listed as missing there after the Vietnam
War, Wrobleski said. Laos doesn't get U.S. aid anyway.
   Paraguay escaped decertification because officials think it
would be counter-productive at a time the United States is trying
to woo that country toward democracy.
   Lebanon retained its certification because there isn't much the
central government can do to stop trafficking and production in
regions of the country it does not control.
   In its estimates of worldwide drug production, the report
predicted that coca leaf output would increase from a high of
211,400 metric tons in 1987 to as much as 213,650 metric tons this
year.
   Marijuana production will drop from a high of 17,625 metric tons
to 10,100 tons, and opium output will drop from a high of 3,017
metric tons to 2,992 metric tons in 1988, the report said. A metric
ton equals 2,200 pounds.
   Ms. Wrobleski said one of the gloomiest outlooks is for control
of coca leaf growth, especially in Peru and Colombia, the origin of
a vast majority of the world's cocaine.
   Bolivia has made some strides in eradicating the crop by sending
work crews into the production areas to kill the plants. That's
impossible in Peru and Colombia, she said, because the growers
control the regions. In Peru, for example, 27 eradication workers
have been killed, she said.

   A Girls Clubs of America leader says the
organization's identity and fund-raising are threatened by a
competing group it is suing.
   The suit filed Monday in U.S. District Court asks for an
injunction to prevent the Boys Clubs of America from changing its
name to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
   ``The importance of this is the perception of the public as to
who they are and who we are,'' Margaret Gates, national executive
director of the Girls Clubs, said Tuesday.
   Thomas Garth, national director-elect of the Boys Clubs, said
that organization has about 300,000 girls among it 1.3 million
members, and their parents are demanding the name change.
   The Girls Clubs says it serves about 250,000 girls and that
about 40,000 boys participate in its activities. The organization
says about 80 percent of it $2.7 million operating budget comes
from contributions and grants that benefit its many members who
come from lower-income families.

<HEAD>In Final Days Before Super Tuesday, Television Ads Get Tougher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidates are turning to
increasingly aggressive television advertising in the week before
the high-stakes Super Tuesday contests in 20 states and American
Samoa.
   Vice President George Bush is taking some heat on the
Iran-Contra affair from Sen. Bob Dole. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. is
moving onto the populist turf claimed thus far by Rep. Richard
Gephardt. And Gephardt is continuing his broadside against
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Gephardt, D-Mo., also is running an ad in which Rep. Marvin
Leath of Texas praises him for standing ``with us for lower taxes,
for an oil import fee to make America strong, for a tough trade
bill to stand up for American workers.'' Leath says Gore and
Dukakis oppose all three.
   Gore spokesman Arlie Schardt said Tuesday it had not been
decided yet whether the Tennessee senator would release his own
cache of hard-hitting ads.
   ``We're prepared for any needs that may arise,'' Schardt said.
``We're considering what other messages we may still want to convey
over the next few days.''
   Gore did mount an indirect TV challenge to Gephardt on Tuesday,
when he started running three new ads promoting populist themes
similar to the ones Gephardt has adopted.
   One new ad depicts Gore as a fighter against polluters,
price-fixers and big corporations _ exactly the type of
anti-establishment image Gephardt has tried to cultivate.
   The other two ads feature Gore talking to groups of Texas oil
workers. In one spot he says corporations need to invest in America
and create jobs at home, while in the other he tells the workers
that ``it's time to put people back to work in the United States
and have the rigs in Libya and Iran stand idle for a change.''
   The ``blame foreigners'' message is strikingly similar to one of
Gephardt's strongest ads, the ``Hyundai'' spot that helped him win
the Iowa caucuses and is now being used across the Super Tuesday
states.
   In that ad the congressman criticizes South Korea for putting
high import tariffs on U.S. autos and asks how many Hyundais the
Koreans could sell here at $48,000 apiece.
   Gephardt has also revived a highly effective South Dakota spot,
now retooled for Super Tuesday, alleging that Dukakis is a
tax-raiser and mocking his suggestion that depressed Iowa farmers
recover by growing Belgian endive.
   The Dukakis campaign was planning to take aim at Gephardt's
newly acquired reputation as an anti-establishment crusader and
possibly run an ad featuring a swirling weathervane to raise
questions about his consistency.
   Leslie Dach, Dukakis's communications director, said no final
decisions had been made about which ads would be used where and
when.
   But he said the general thrust of the spots is that Gephardt
``says he is leading the little guy's fight but his campaign is
financed and supported by the big guys. His biggest contributors
are America's biggest corporations. He has failed to show a set of
principles or a set of values that give a rudder to his policies.''
   He said Dukakis was also prepared to counter-attack against
Gore, if necessary.
   Dukakis has commercials on the air in Texas and Florida, the
biggest Super Tuesday states, plus Maryland. His ad campaign was to
expand this week into Washington state, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, aides said.
   Dole, R-Kan., went on the air Tuesday in North Carolina and
South Carolina with an ad contrasting his and Bush's positions on a
number of issues, including the Iran-Contra affair.
   The narrator says Dole ``opposed selling arms to Iran. Bush
supported the arms-for-hostages deal.'' The ad also accuses Bush of
waffling on taxes, taking a soft line on the U.S.-Soviet arms
control treaty, and opposing a textile bill popular in several
Southern states.
   Another Dole spot running in Florida depicts a man walking
through snow but leaving no footprints. Dole campaign manager Bill
Brock said the message is that Bush ``has held all these big jobs''
yet left no mark.
   The vice president, in West Palm Beach, Fla., called the
``footprints'' commercial ``terribly ineffective.''
   Bush's campaign refused to disclose any details of how or
whether it planned to respond. But the vice president said: ``We're
not going to sit out there unprotected. ... I think I have every
right to set the record straight.''
   Bush used a negative ad against Dole in New Hampshire last
month, but it ran for only a couple of days before the primary.
   As the Super Tuesday TV campaign grew more heated, Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., questioned Pat Robertson's judgment in radio ads
throughout South Carolina, which holds a GOP primary on Saturday.
   The Kemp ad asks if the former television evangelist has ``the
qualifications and the judgment to be our next president'' and
cites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestion
that public schools be eliminated. Robertson later changed his mind
about that.
   In addition to negative ads, the candidates are using more
traditional biographical spots and political testimonials. Among
them: former Sen. Barry Goldwater endorses Bush, former House
Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts praises Dukakis, and
Rep. Claude Pepper _ an elderly Florida legislator with enormous
clout among senior citizens _ speaks kindly of Gephardt.
   At least two candidates, Gore and Dukakis, are using
Spanish-language ads in Texas. Dukakis does the talking himself.
``The governor is fluent in Spanish, so it seemed like the thing to
do,'' said Tom Cosgrove, Dukakis's Texas campaign director.
   There are 712 Republican delegates and 1,307 Democratic
delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday, March 8. Television is the
candidates' major tool in seeking to win them.

   Academics and business managers from the Soviet
Union and the United States will team up to study four industrial
sites in each country in an effort to develop management guidelines
for joint ventures.
   The study will mark the first time Westerners will be allowed to
participate in on-site research of Soviet decision-making methods,
project director Paul R. Lawrence, a professor at Harvard
University's Graduate School of Business Administration, said
Tuesday.
   The study is not aimed at encouraging joint ventures, but to
``make sure the projects that do get started are operated
successfully and the combined management teams of Soviet and
American managers will be able to work with each other
effectively,'' Lawrence said.
   Two faculty members from the Harvard business school and two
representatives of the Research Institute of External Economic
Affairs in Moscow, the research arm of the Soviet Foreign Economic
Commission, will work on the study.
   The study, scheduled to begin in May and end in September, will
include Electrosila, a Leningrad-based manufacturer of heavy
industrial equipment. The other sites have not been determined,
Lawrence said.
   ``We want to prepare guidelines that will help the day-to-day
management of joint ventures in the Soviet Union with American
firms,'' Lawrence said. ``This could be in any number of fields.''
   The research will focus on capital investments, appointing and
terminating a middle manager, introducing a new product and
formulating and implementing an annual business plan.
   Lawrence said the choices are a good cross-section of real
business decisions. ``They represent quite a range of the kinds of
things operating managers do,'' he said.
   Four case studies based on the research are expected to be
completed by November and the final version is scheduled for
publication by July 1989.
   The co-director of the Harvard team is Charalambos
Vlachoutsicos, a research fellow at the school. Co-chairmen of the
Soviet team are Igor Faminsky, director of the Institute and B.I.
Fomin, general director of Electrosila. The project will be jointly
funded.

   A correspondent for the Chicago Tribune in the
Middle East has resigned after writing a story that contained some
material taken, without attribution, from a story printed in the
Jerusalem Post, the Tribune said.
   The Tribune published a brief notice of Jonathan Broder's
resignation Monday under its ``Corrections and Clarifications''
headline.
   Broder's story Feb. 22 ``included a number of sentences and
phrases taken, without attribution, from a column by another writer
that had been published previously in the Jerusalem Post,'' the
Tribune said.
   That material ``constitutes only a fraction of the total story
and contributed significantly only to organization and imagery,''
the Tribune said.
   ``There's no justification for what he did. There's an
explanation, but no justification,'' Tribune Editor James D.
Squires said Tuesday.
   ``We said he cribbed the story and he resigned,'' Squires said.
He declined further comment.
   Broder's story began:
   ``Anyone traveling the roads of the West Bank these days cannot
fail to notice the fundamental change that has overtaken the area
in the last 10 weeks.''
   The Jerusalem Post story began:
   ``Anyone traveling the roads of the West Bank these days cannot
fail to sense the change that has come over the area in the last
two months.''
   The Tribune said Broder's story was accurate, but ``the byline
inaccurately implied that it was all Mr. Broder's work.''
   Broder, a full-time reporter with the Tribune since 1979, was
with family in San Francisco, said a Chicago Tribune staff member
who asked not to be identified. The staffer declined to provide a
telephone number for Broder.

   Bob Dole assailed George Bush on the Iran-Contra affair in a
tough new television commercial Tuesday and Richard Gephardt used
an advertisement to attack Democratic rivals Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore Jr. as the presidential campaign spread across the
South one week before Super Tuesday.
   Bush defeated Dole Tuesday night in Vermont's non-binding GOP
presidential primary, and Dukakis won the state's Democratic
contest, with Jesse Jackson running second.
   ``This win gives us three out of three in New England, and I'm
hopeful we can be as successful this Saturday in South Carolina and
on Super Tuesday,'' Bush said.
   Mary Ellen Grupp said the Dole campaign was very pleased with
Dole's ``strong showing'' and would use the primary results to
build up for the GOP caucuses in April.
   Former President Carter, the last Democrat to occupy the White
House, said he thought the chances were 50-50 that no Democrat
would arrive at the party nominating convention with enough
delegates to claim the nomination.
   Bush sounded confident that nothing of the sort would happen in
the Republican race. Bush, in a strong position in virtually all of
the Southern states that will vote next week, said, ``I'm convinced
that whoever wins Super Tuesday will be the next president.''
   Bush was further buoyed by the results of a Washington Post-ABC
News poll released Tuesday, showing him with a nearly 3-to-1 lead
over Dole among Republicans likely to vote Super Tuesday. Dukakis
and Jackson were battling for the Democratic lead.
   GOP hopeful Pat Robertson, meanwhile, said he intends to drop
his $35 million libel suit against former Rep. Pete McCloskey
rather than go to trial on Super Tuesday.
   Robertson has accused McCloskey of defaming him in a letter
contending that the former television evangelist used the influence
of his father, the late Sen. A. Willis Robertson, to avoid combat
duty in the Korean War. But Robertson may not be able to walk away
from the suit without paying McCloskey's legal fees.
   With nearly all the precincts reporting in Vermont's ``beauty
contest'' primary, Bush had 49 percent to Dole's 39 percent.
Robertson had 5 percent and Rep. Jack Kemp 3.4 percent.
   Dukakis rolled to a solid win with 56 percent; Jackson had 27
percent; Gephardt 8 percent; Paul Simon 6 percent and Gary Hart 4
percent. Gore was not on the ballot.
   ``We have found the common chord that is linking the American
people, whether they are in Iowa or Maine or New Hampshire or
Mississippi,'' Jackson said about his impressive showing.
   The Vermont contest did not involve allocating any delegates to
the Republican and Democratic national convention.
   In contrast, Super Tuesday on March 8 involves 1,307 delegates
in Democratic primaries and caucuses in 20 states and 712 delegates
in 17 contests on the Republican side.
   The broad sweep of that day's contests means candidates must
place greater stress than ever before on costly television
commercials. Gone are the days of ``retail politics,'' consisting
of six stops in Iowa or New Hampshire in a single day.
   The new campaign style features chartered jets, trips to two or
three regions of two or three different states _ and a heavy dose
of commercials scattered across several states.
   In his new advertisement, Dole says that Bush has refused to say
he would veto an increase in income tax rates, that he won't
support a textile import bill and that he ``supported the arms for
hostages deal'' in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``That's precisely what he did _ he supported the sale of arms
to Iran,'' the Kansas senator said as he campaigned in Durham, N.C.
   Bush campaigned in Florida, where he said of Dole's Iran-Contra
comments, ``I support the president. I have nothing to say about
Dole's charges, nothing at all.'' Instead, he touted his own role
in the decision to invade Grenada with U.S. troops in 1983, as well
as the part he has played in the administration's anti-drug program.
   If Bush is heavily favored in most Republican Super Tuesday
states, the Democratic contest shapes up as a struggle among
Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, Missouri Rep. Gephardt, Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson.
   Ironically, it was a Democratic idea to develop a regional
Southern primary, in the hopes that it would give a candidate from
the deep South a springboard to the nomination.
   It hasn't worked that way, and Carter, who invited Gephardt to
his home in Plains, Ga., said he is no longer sure whether the idea
is good or bad.
   He added, ``My hope is that out of the primary and caucus season
will come a clear winner. I'm not sure that's a likelihood now.''
   Gephardt said he traveled to Carter's home in rural Georgia
``not to enhance my prospects but to greet an old friend.''
   At the same time, he began running a new commercial in which
Texas Rep. Marvin Leath says Gephardt ``stood with us for lower
taxes, for an oil import fee to make American strong, for a tough
new trade bill to stand up for American workers.''
   ``On all these issues, Gore and Dukakis were opposed to us,'' he
says.
   There was no immediate response from either Gore or Dukakis.
   Among the other Democrats, Jackson was in Washington, where he
met with officials from South Africa about the recent arrests of
black leaders in that country.
   Sen. Paul Simon, largely skipping Southern states, campaigned in
Seattle for support in the Washington caucuses.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, struggling to survive in the Republican race,
said if either Bush, Dole or Robertson wins the GOP nomination,
``the Reagan Revolution is over.''
   Robertson, under pressure for several comments he has made in
the past two weeks, said a transcript of 1967 Senate subcommittee
testimony supports his belief that there are nuclear missiles in
Cuba. He quoted testimony by a State Department official who said a
Cuban refugee told him of the missiles.
   ``This is documented evidence,'' Robertson said.

<TEXT>
   An assembly began an 11-day session
Tuesday to elect a new president and vice president.
   The session opened with a 35-page report by President Suharto on
the affairs of state since he was re-elected in 1983 for a fourth
five-year term.
   The 1,000-member assembly is expected to re-elect Suharto, a
66-year-old former general and the sole candidate for president.
   The People's Consultative Assembly, dominated by the president's
governing GOLKAR Party, is a special body summoned every five years.
   The post of vice president, though largely ceremonial, has been
the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks because it is
likely to be filled by a figure considered to be Suharto's chosen
successor.
   Two people have been viewed as possible candidates for the vice
presidency: State Secretary Sudharmono, 61, GOLKAR chairman, and
Try Sutrisno, 52, newly appointed armed forces commander, who has
served four years as a Suharto aide.
   In his report to the assembly, Suharto said his administration
in the last five years has had to overcome an economic recession
and a sharp drop in oil prices, a major source of foreign exchange
in Indonesia.
   Suharto also said Indonesia's economic growth rate was estimated
to reach an average of 3.8 percent annually in the current
five-year economic plan ending March 1989. The original target was
set at 5 percent.
   In foreign affairs, the president reaffirmed Indonesia's
position that it will not normalize relations with China until
Beijing pledges it will not provide support to communist guerrillas
in the region, including Indonesia.
   Jakarta suspended relations with Beijing in 1967 after accusing
it of complicity in the abortive communist coup attempt of 1965.
   However, trade relations between the two nations have been
restored since the signing of a memorandum of understanding in July
1985.

   Texas will seek a court order to stop the
shipment of Florida citrus to Texas and other citrus-producing
states, officials say.
   The move was prompted by a judge's order Tuesday that overturned
a Texas ban on the Florida fruit.
   Texas imposed the ban last month after a federal rule took
effect allowing the shipment of Florida citrus that meets certain
standards to other citrus-producing states.
   The new rule lifted a 3{-year-old federal quarantine on Florida
citrus that was prompted by discovery of the citrus canker disease
in that state.
   U.S. District Judge James Nowlin said he overturned the ban
because the federal regulation takes precedence over the state rule.
   Texas agriculture officials said the ban was needed to protect
Texas' $65 million-a-year citrus industry from canker.

<HEAD>Expected Budget Surplus Raises Hopes for Tax Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
steps before the House of Commons on March 15, he is expected to
unveil one of the rarest of British commodities _ a budget surplus.
   The expectation is so real that already there is widespread talk
of a massive tax cut _ and also widespread criticism of the
government's reputed plans for the extra money.
   ``The budget on March 15 should be the most momentous of
Britain's postwar history,'' the Economist magazine said.
   Anything could happen in the next two weeks, and the budget may
turn out very different from what is now forecast.
   But for the moment, analysts are assuming a tax cut is in the
works, and the government's critics are attacking the budget as a
gift to the rich at the expense of the poor.
   Last autumn the government announced its planned expenditures of
$278 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989, and the
spring Budget Day is when it discloses how it will raise the money.
   For the first time in almost 20 years, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government might produce a budget surplus
for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, said a Treasury
spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance with British custom.
   The government expects to out-perform its most recent forecast
of a deficit of $1.77 billion, which was down from a previously
forecast deficit of $7.1 billion, the spokesman said.
   ``It will probably turn out to be a surplus,'' said Diane Coyoe,
economist for the private forecasting firm DRI Europe.
   ``Very definitely a surplus,'' said Anthony Thomas, an economist
at the London investment firm Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd.
   The surplus will be $2 billion to $5 billion, the economists
estimated.
   If they are right, the surplus will have resulted from the
government's tight grip on spending, its buoyant tax receipts and
proceeds from its giant and continuing privatization program of
selling off to the public billions of dollars' worth of state-owned
companies.
   The surplus has sparked speculation that the government will
slash its top income tax rate of 60 percent to 50 percent or even
lower in what would be the biggest cut in almost 10 years.
   The cut, which applies to people earning more than $72,900
annually, would be effective in the fiscal year beginning April 1.
   Thomas said there was much speculation that Lawson would cut it
below 50 percent. ``We suspect he will want to do those cuts over
an extended time period. It will seem like too much of a giveaway
(otherwise).''
   But the Times of London said Lawson might slash the rate to as
low as 35 percent, adding: ``The chancellor has been stung by
criticisms from his own party that President Reagan's tax reforms
in the U.S. have overtaken Britain with a simplified system ....''
   In her first budget, in June 1979, Mrs. Thatcher cut the top
rate from 83 percent to 60 percent. It has remained unchanged since.
   In the United States, the top federal income tax rate is 33
percent this year, although for most individuals, the maximum rate
is 28 percent.
   Lawson also is expected to cut the lowest tax rate, which
applies to income up to $31,600, to 25 percent from 27 percent.
That rate stood at 33 percent in 1979.
   The expected tax cuts _ part of Mrs. Thatcher's long-term,
sweeping reform of the tax system _ would be highly controversial
in a country where the welfare state prevails despite the prime
minister's capitalist revolution.
   ``The government is bracing itself for the charge that ... it
will be introducing `a rich man's budget,''' the Observer newspaper
wrote.
   Critics of Mrs. Thatcher's tight spending policies already have
raised a furor, demanding that surplus money go to the National
Health Service rather than toward tax cuts.
   In February, nurses staged a one-day walkout to protest the
state of the health service, which has 700,000 people waiting for
surgery at state hospitals.
   Other critics fear that cuts could spur consumer spending enough
to ignite inflation and force up interest rates.
   But Mrs. Thatcher's supporters say her fiscal policies have
helped boost Britain's now-strong economy.
   The budget proposals must be approved by Parliament, where they
are assured passage because of the Conservative Party's 102-seat
majority in the 650-seat House of Commons.

   Actress Molly Ringwald, whose movie
``For Keeps'' was criticized as glamorizing teen-age pregnancy, is
doing a commercial aimed at keeping teen-agers from getting
pregnant, a spokeswoman says.
   Ms. Ringwald is recording the 30-second spot for a state program
called Parents Too Soon, said Audrey Stewart, a spokeswoman for the
program.
   The public-service announcement, which Ms. Ringwald is doing at
no charge, will be sent to radio stations across Illinois and may
be broadcast as early as this month, Ms. Stewart said Tuesday.
   Illinois officials criticized Ms. Ringwald's movie shortly after
its premiere in January.
   ``For Keeps'' features the actress as a middle-class teen-ager
who has a baby, marries her boyfriend, finishes high school and
goes off to college with her husband _ both on full scholarship.

   Rock sensation Michael Jackson thrilled the
United Negro College Fund with a check for $600,000.
   ``There aren't many days like this,'' UNCF President Christopher
Edley said after accepting the check from the singer at a
jam-packed news conference Tuesday.
   Jackson, wearing a striped shirt and bright red blazer, waved as
more then two dozen camera crews and twice as many still
photographers took hundreds of pictures of the usually reclusive
superstar.
   ``Thank you. I'm very honored and very thankful,'' Jackson said
during his 15 seconds at the microphone. ``I love you all. Thank
you.''
   The check represented the proceeds from Jackson's scheduled
Thursday night show at Madison Square Garden, his first solo
performance in New York.
   Jackson earlier created a ``Michael Jackson Scholarship'' for
the UNCF. In the past three years, 97 students have received
financial aid through the program.

   Entertainer Bette Midler, who grew up in Hawaii,
and her husband have purchased a $1.5 million piece of the islands
that was confiscated in a federal drug case.
   Midler and husband, Martin von Haselberg, paid cash for the
38-acre parcel on Kauai Island, which includes a partly completed
tri-level home and a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean and a
river, said U.S. Marshal Faith Evans.
   Midler attended the University of Hawaii before moving to New
York to pursue her career as a singer and actress.
   The property, near the town of Kilauea, was among 141 acres
seized by the Justice Department in 1986 after authorities charged
the owners had purchased it with money from illegal drug sales,
Evans said Monday.

``man in black'' _ Johnny Cash.
   The $70,000 exhibit is scheduled to open March 23, the Hall of
Fame said Monday.
   ``This collection provides unprecedented documentation of
country music's most distinguished career,'' said Hall of Fame
Director Bill Ivey. ``It is extraordinarily rich due to Cash's
unusual level of cooperation and interest, and the availability of
his extensive personal archives.''
   At Cash's suggestion, the entire exhibit is being mounted and
displayed with black, white and silver graphics. It will be divided
into sections devoted to various periods of Cash's life.
   This is the third biographical exhibit at the Hall of Fame.
Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson also have been honored.
   Cash's hits include ``I Walk The Line,'' ``A Boy Named Sue,''
``Folsom Prison Blues'' and ``Ring of Fire.''

<HEAD>Robertson Says Suspected Drug Flights Should Be Shot Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson said he would use the military to help stem the flow of
illegal drugs into the United States and would order airplanes
suspected of carrying drugs to be shot down.
   ``If one of those drug planes is flying without giving
identification ... coming into this country, I wouldn't hesitate to
give orders to shoot him down,'' the former television evangelist
said at a rally Tuesday.
   ``I believe we have played games long enough with drugs,''
Robertson said. ``I don't think we are being as aggressive as we
should.''
   Robertson, who has tapped a vein of anti-communist sentiment
among Cuban-Americans as he campaigns around Florida, also accused
Cuban President Fidel Castro of involvement in drug trafficking.
   Earlier, Robertson cited 21-year-old, second-hand testimony
before a Senate subcommittee as evidence that the Soviet Union has
intermediate-range missiles based in Cuba.
   He called for closing what he calls a ``Cuban loophole'' in the
U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which now is
awaiting ratification by the Senate.
   ``If the INF treaty is ratified without addressing this matter
then I think it will be virtually treasonous,'' Robertson said at a
news conference. ``I do not feel there is any way that they can
sweep this thing under the rug. I am not going to permit them to do
it.''
   Several U.S. officials said Tuesday the Cuban military has some
surface-to-surface missiles in its inventory, but none has a
nuclear warhead and none could reach the United States even if it
did.
   Robertson quoted 1967 testimony by Paul Bethel, a State
Department official from Miami, who said Cuban refugees had told
him of seeing missiles, and one of the refugees, identified only as
Mr. Apud, who swore Cuban soldiers let him know about missiles
aimed at Washington before he left in 1966.
   Neither man testified he had personally seen the missiles, the
transcript indicates.
   The testimony was given to the Judiciary subcommittee to
investigate the administration of the Internal Security Act and
other internal security laws. Robertson read portions of it to
supporters Tuesday at a breakfast in Fort Lauderdale and during a
rally the night before in Miami.
   ``I've been accused of bringing funny facts,'' Robertson told
the Fort Lauderdale gathering. ``Ladies and gentlemen, the clear
eyewitness, sworn testimony of witnesses before a Senate Judiciary
committee is not funny facts. ... This is documented evidence.''
   Robertson's assertion that there are missiles based in Cuba has
been denied by the White House, congressional defense experts and
Castro, who told NBC on Monday that Robertson should ``go and see a
doctor, really, or a psychiatrist, because this is pure madness.''
   Several defense and administration officials were asked Tuesday
about Robertson's claim. The officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity because they did not want to become involved in the
presidential race, said Cuba has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7
battlefield missiles, dating from the 1960s.
   The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, could
carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, ``but we're
confident no nuclear warheads ever went to Cuba for that missile
and it doesn't have any range anyway,'' said one source who
requested anonymity.
   According to the reference book ``Jane's Weapon Systems,'' the
Frog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distance
between Cuba and Florida. Moreover, the rocket has no guidance
system to direct it to a specific target.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said last month that Cuba
has been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisis
and there is ``no evidence'' any other nuclear weaponry had ever
been deployed there by the Soviet Union.
   In the subcommittee transcript, Apud said he was told by Cuban
soldiers he had known for many years that the missiles were
nicknamed ``Washington Left,'' ``Washington Right,'' and
``Washington Central.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Bureau Of Land Management Lax In Protecting Streamsides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study is painting a dismal
environmental picture of vital streamside areas on federal property
across the West.
   Tens of thousands of miles of these riparian areas have been
degraded by poor livestock grazing practices on land leased to
ranchers by the Bureau of Land Management, according to the General
Accounting Office, the investigative wing of Congress.
   James Duffus, a GAO official, says the damaged land would start
repairing itself if the bureau either would ban cattle from
degraded streamsides or limit the amount of grazing there.
   But that solution is being made difficult because bureau leaders
appear to be siding with opposition from many ranchers who pay
below-market rates to graze cattle on the taxpayers' land, he told
a House hearing Tuesday.
   Streamside areas are important in the arid West because they
help raise water tables, collect sediment, increase the
availability of forage, dissipate the energy of flood waters and
serve as fish and wildlife habitats, said Duffus, the GAO's
associate director for resources, community and economic
development.
   ``It has taken decades of abuse to produce the level of riparian
area degradation that currently exists,'' he told the Interior
national parks and public lands subcommittee. ``Most riparian areas
managed by the bureau are in degraded condition largely as a result
of poorly managed livestock grazing.''
   Duffus said that while the bureau does not know the extent of
the damage, ``tens of thousands of stream miles on federal
rangelands remain in degraded condition.''
   Duffus said two bureau assessments found that 80 percent of the
12,000 miles of streamside areas in Idaho need better management
and that 90 percent of 5,000 miles in Colorado were rated in poor
or fair condition.
   Not only has the bureau reduced its ranks of wildlife and
fisheries biologists since 1981, many remaining personnel
responsible for riparian areas don't believe the bureau is serious
about improving the condition of the streamside areas, according to
Duffus.
   ``These staff widely believe that if their proposed actions for
restoring riparian areas are opposed by the permitted ranchers,
their managers will not support them,'' he said.
   ``Many bureau staff ... recounted specific instances where their
riparian management efforts were specifically undercut by bureau
headquarters or local management direction after permitted ranches
raised objections,'' Duffus said.
   Subcommittee Chairman Bruce Vento, D-Minn., distributed copies
of a 1986 bureau headquarters memo telling field personnel that
streamside area management ``requires the full support and
cooperation of the permittee or lessee.''
   Pointing to the memo, Vento asked whether ranchers using bureau
land for cattle grazing are experts in environmental restoration.
   ``I wouldn't look to them for any expertise,'' Duffus replied.
   Tim Locke, a bureau spokesman, gave no immediate response when
asked by The Associated Press to comment on Duffus' report.

<HEAD>Recording Industry Vows New Attack on DAT Recorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The music industry promises to find a new way
to thwart home taping with digital recorders now that its proposed
electronic anti-taping device has been declared ineffective by the
National Bureau of Standards.
   The bureau's report, released Tuesday, dealt a blow to the
recording industry's campaign to prevent digital audio tape, or
DAT, recorders from reaching the domestic market.
   The recorders, now manufactured by Japan and other foreign
makers, can copy compact disc recordings with virtually no loss in
sound quality. The U.S. recording industry fears that the machines
will lead to mass copying that would devastate the compact disc and
record markets, and so far has managed to keep the devices off the
U.S. market.
   But Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of a House
Judiciary subcommittee that handles copyright issues, said the
results of the bureau's study _ which he requested last year _
shows that Congress should stop trying to prevent U.S. sales of DAT
recorders.
   Kastenmeier said the report appears to doom an industry-backed
bill that would require equipping DAT recorders with scanning
devices intended to prevent copying of specially coded recordings.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., also would
prohibit the manufacture or sale of any device designed to bypass
the scanner.
   The bureau, an agency of the Commerce Department, said that the
scanning device was unreliable and easily bypassed, and that it
damaged the sound quality of recordings.
   ``Because the report was conclusive about the ineffectiveness of
blocking devices, it is even more desirable that the DAT
controversy be resolved by the industries involved, rather than by
congressional imposition of a solution,'' Kastenmeier said.
   Kastenmeier said in an interview that as a result of the bureau
of standards report, ``I think it highly unlikely that the Waxman
bill will succeed.''
   U.S. manufacturers voluntarily blocked introduction of DAT units
on the domestic market until Congress resolved the home taping
issue, but the self-imposed ban has recently shown signs of
crumbling under pressure from foreign manufacturers and demand from
U.S. recording enthusiasts.
   Kastenmeier said an alternative to a congressional solution
might be payment of recording artists out of proceeds from sales of
DAT units, or from an endowment fund created by the recording
industry.
   Jason Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, said the industry accepts the study results but intends to
find a new technological solution to home taping, which he said
costs the recording companies $1.5 billion in lost sales annually.
   ``Working together with the hardware manufacturers, we are
certain to find an acceptable technological solution,'' Berman said.
   Meanwhile, recording industry officials promised to sue any
manufacturer that tries to sell the machines in the United States
before the copying issue is resolved, either legislatively or
through industry negotiations.
   But Gary Shapiro of the Home Recording Rights Coalition said
``there is no reason at this point why manufacturers should not be
selling'' digital recorders in the United States.
   The coalition has been fighting anti-taping efforts as an
infringement on the rights of consumers to make home recordings of
records, tapes and compact discs for their private use.
   The scanning device was designed to detect ``notches,'' or tiny
bands of frequencies removed from the audio signal of protected
recordings, and interrupt taping of copies with intervals of
silence.
   The bureau said its series of laboratory tests showed that
notched material was recorded anyway in about half of the sound
tracks studied.
   Advocates of the anti-taping device claimed that the notches did
not affect sound quality. But the bureau said its study showed that
``the system's encoder alters the original electrical signal,''
resulting in ``a discernible difference'' between notched and
unnotched recordings.
   Also, the bureau said, ``the copy prevention system can be
bypassed easily.'' It said its engineers designed and built several
electronic circuits to circumvent the system in five different ways.
   ``The circuits are simple and easy to construct'' and cost about
$100, the bureau said.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's investment
manager turned a $40,000 profit for him under an arrangement that
may have involved financial favors or gifts to the attorney
general, says a senator.
   The investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn, ``wasn't investing
Mr. Meese's money, so much as he was assigning profits and losses
to the accounts of Mr. Meese and his other clients at his own
discretion,'' Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Tuesday.
   Chinn, now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, turned a
profit of nearly $40,000 for Meese on a $50,000 investment in just
23 one-day trades of brand-new stock issues over an 18-month span.
Meese established a limited blind partnership with Chinn's company
and the attorney general says that under the arrangement he knew
nothing about Chinn's stock trading activity.
   The Democratic majority staff of the Senate subcommittee on
oversight of government management found that stock purchases by
Chinn which later appeared in Meese's account were initially made
without identifying the customer in whose name the stock would
eventually be recorded. The purchases were assigned by Chinn to the
accounts he managed, after the profit or loss was known.
   The report said that in one instance, Chinn bought and sold
5,000 shares of a new stock issue in Oliver Stores Inc. worth
$30,000 on Feb. 11, 1986. It wasn't until the next day, however,
that Chinn instructed Imperial Trust Co. that 2,000 of the shares
were to be recorded for Meese's account. The transaction gave Meese
a profit of more than $1,700.
   In seven of the 23 stock trades, Chinn spent substantially more
money on behalf of his corporation's limited blind partnership with
Meese than Meese had invested in the account, the subcommittee
staff found. The sums ranged from $5,000 to $140,000.
   Chinn exceeded the account balances for his other customers as
well, said the subcommittee staff. He avoided the appearance that
he had exceeded the account balance by directing that his stock
purchases be recorded as if they had been made in smaller lots, any
one of which would not exceed the account balance.
   ``Because he did not allocate winners and losers to his clients'
accounts until after the fact, he was effectively able to assign
greater benefits to some _ including apparently Mr. Meese on
numerous occasions,'' Levin said in a statement. ``This procedure
again raises questions about possible financial favors or gifts.''
   Levin asked the Office of Government Ethics in a letter for a
formal finding on whether Meese complied with federal regulations
governing gifts and loans to public officials.
   Levin also sent a copy of the letter to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to investigate possible violations of
regulations prohibiting brokers from exceeding account balances and
regulations governing the conduct by investment advisers.
   Meese ``had no knowledge of Chinn's stock trading activity and I
don't think Meese should be held responsible,'' said one of the
attorney general's lawyers, Nathan Lewin.
   ``This blind partnership was set up to be sure that he had no
knowledge of how things were being done.''
   Lewin dismissed suggestions that Meese should have reported the
amount over the account balances as gifts, saying ``there were a
number of losing transactions as well as profitable transactions.''
   Meese made a profit on 18 of the trades and lost money on five.
   According to the majority subcommittee staff, on Sept. 4, 1986,
Chinn had $730,000 in five of his customers' accounts at Imperial
Trust Co., but on that day bought $6.6 million in Sears, Roebuck
stock for them, which subsequently was reflected as 34 separate
transactions and sales.
   Chinn, a former director of scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., was
introduced to the attorney general in 1985 by longtime Meese friend
E. Robert Wallach. Chinn and Wallach are now under indictment for
racketeering, fraud and conspiracy in an alleged scheme to extract
payments from the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor in order to
influence Meese and other federal officials. Wallach and Chinn have
pleaded innocent.
   Meese has been under criminal investigation by independent
counsel James McKay since last May 11 for his involvement with
Wedtech. Meese acknowledges interceding on behalf of the company
when he was White House counselor to ensure that the firm got a
fair hearing from the Army in its effort to win a $32 million
no-bid engine-building contract. The company eventually got the
work.
   Sources familiar with McKay's probe say one aspect of the
investigation has been an examination of Chinn's stock trading to
determine whether Chinn may have given Meese preferential treatment
over other customers.
   Meese may be found to have benefited from a ``very subtle
bribe'' if preferential treatment were found and were determined to
be a reward for official action, one knowledgeable law enforcement
source said in December.
   One of Chinn's lawyers, Penny Cooper, said the questions
addressed by Levin's subcommittee are ``exactly the same material
the independent counsel went over for months and they found no
wrongdoing. There was no wrongdoing.'' She said that Chinn ``did no
better for Meese than any other client.''
   The subcommittee staff didn't reach any conclusions on whether
Meese received preferential treatment.

   Inamullah Khan of Pakistan today won the 1988
Templeton Prize for promoting interreligious cooperation. He is the
first Moslem to win the $390,000 international award.
   It is biggest prize given in the world, about $40,000 more than
the Nobel prizes in science and literature.
   Announcement of this year's winner was to be made at a news
conference at Manhattan's Church Center of the United Nations.
   Khan, 73, a founder and secretary-general of the World Moslem
Congress, was cited for his ``tireless work as a coordinator for
peace between Moslems, Christians and Jews.''
   Khan, of Karachi, also is chairman of the executive committee of
the interreligious World Conference on Religion and Peace,
presiding at meetings around the world.
   He has been keenly supportive of United Nations concerns,
including disarmament, human rights, education and welfare, and
twice has chaired meetings of the World Federation of United
Nations Associations in Geneva, Switzerland.
   The annual prize, established in 1972 by American financeer John
Templeton, is given to recognize those ``who through original and
pioneering ways advanced the knowledge and love of God.''
   The 1988 prize is to presented May 10 by England's Princess
Alexandra at London's Guild Hall.
   Of the previous 15 winners, 13 have been Christians, one Hindu
and one Buddhist.
   The first winner was Mother Teresa of Calcutta, India, founder
of the Roman Catholic Missionaries of Charity, while last year's
winner was physicist Stanley L. Jaki, a Roman Catholic, of Seton
Hall University in South Orange, N.J.
   Other winners have included:
   Southern Baptist evangelist Billy Graham, Russian Orthodox
expatriate Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Belgium's Cardinal Joseph
Suenens, U.S. Presbyterian educator James I. McCord and France's
Brother Roger, founder of the Taize ecumenical community.
   An international, interreligious panel of judges picks the
winners.
   Khan, born in Burma and a graduate in arts and law from Rangoon
University, was a high school principal in Rangoon and editor of
Burma's Moslem Daily until 1942 when Burma was occupied by Japan.
   He then settled in India, where he headed the All-India Burmese
Evacuees Association and the Islamic Brotherhood Society. On
establishment of Pakistan in 1948, he became a citizen, settling in
Karachi.
   There, he founded the World Moslem Congress, its offices
initially in his home, but which now has an imposing new
headquarters there.
   As secretary-general, he has traveled throughout the Moslem
world, including both sides of the protracted Iran-Iraq war, and
has stood with banned Christian leaders in South Africa.
   The Rev. Wilbert Forker, vice president of the Templeton
Foundation, said Khan has given ``much energy and imagination to
building bridges between the Moslem world and neighbors from other
religions and cultures.''
   He ``has lived in a generation when religion has often come in
for attack from secular sources'' and has challenged ``atheistic
teachings and practices'' and pressed religion to correct its
failings, Forker said.
   ``He is clearly a man sustained by his faith in God and in human
values and by his sense of solidarity with his community and with
humanity,'' Forker said. ``Religion for him is not simply a private
matter but an essential motivation for society.''

<HEAD>Report: Improper Use of Seat Belts Dangerous but Common</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many motorists who wear seat belts are still
exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly,
according to a federal study that says women, children and
motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk.
   The National Transportation Safety Board raised questions
Tuesday about the way some belt users wear the safety devices after
examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted.
   Twenty-one percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much
slack in the shoulder harnesses, and 7 percent of the occupants,
often children, wore belts that were improperly routed behind the
back or under an arm.
   Thirty-one states have laws requiring use of safety belts. But
NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett said, ``We have a lot of misuse and that
problem has to be tackled.''
   Overall, the safety board said, lap-shoulder belts provide
excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants
suffering minor or no injuries. But the study suggested the results
could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of
belts.
   The NTSB study was not a random sample and, therefore, does not
necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists,
said Lynne Smith, who was involved in writing of the report. But,
she added, the data are consistent with previous findings of
widespread misuse.
   For example, the report cited an earlier insurance industry
study of Maryland motorists indicating that belts are worn too
loosely about one-fourth of the time.
   Examples of misuse with tragic consequences included a head-on
collision and an accident in which a car struck a tree, according
to the safety board.
   In the head-on crash, a passenger who had loosened her shoulder
belt significantly died of massive injuries, while the driver who
had worn his belt snugly ``walked away from the crash with moderate
injuries,'' said Suzanne Stack, an NTSB staff researcher.
   In the other crash, the driver, who had worn his belt properly,
escaped with minor injuries when his car struck a tree, but the
passenger, whose shoulder belt was routed under her arm, was killed
from extensive injuries.
   The board also cited examples of people suffering extensive
injuries _ fatal ones in a case involving a 7-year-old boy _ when
belts were used while seats were in the reclining position. In some
cases the combination of the belt and the reclining seat may create
new dangers, the report suggested.
   The four-member safety board urged the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration to require that safety belts meet standards
for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt
systems be equipped with a ``pre-tension'' device that
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash.
   The safety board questioned the widespread use among U.S.
carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt
out to its full length without it automatically retracting. Most
foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps
the belt snug against the occupant, but which has been criticized
as being less comfortable and, therefore, less likely to be used.
   The safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged
50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to
misuse belts, especially wearing them too loosely. Ms. Smith said
that, generally, slack equal to no more than the width of a fist
should be allowed in the shoulder belt.
   A particularly high misuse of belts was found among children.
One-third had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm.
   ``Such misuse ... seriously degrades the protective capabilities
of the lap-shoulder belt, reducing it to a lap-only belt with
inferior crash protection,'' the safety board said.
   A number of auto safety pamphlets, including two distributed by
the NHTSA and one by the American Automobile Association, have
advised parents to place the shoulder belt behind a child if the
harness crosses the neck or face.
   ``The safety board does not agree,'' the NTSB report said.
``There is little evidence that small children or short adults are
likely to be harmed by the shoulder portion of a belt.''
   The board called for the highway safety agency to revise its
brochures.
   NHTSA, which issues auto safety regulations, was reviewing the
NTSB report, said spokeswoman Betsy Tyson.

   The United States might not have fared that well
in the Winter Olympics, but ABC was a big winner.
   The high-rated two weeks of prime-time Olympics, pre-empting
ABC's entire schedule, have given the network a February sweeps win
that breaks NBC's 11-sweeps streak. ABC is now second on the season.
   The Olympics averaged a prime-time rating of 19.3 and a 30
share, up 5 percent over the 1984 Winter Olympics, according to the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ABC estimates that more than 150 million viewers
saw some of this year's Games.
   Saturday night's figure-skating finale was last week's No. 1
show, earning a rating of 26.4 and a 43 share, and included the
highest-rated half hour of Saturday viewing since ``Roots'' in 1977.
   Olympics coverage on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday also made it
into the top 10. Wednesday's was 12th, Sunday's 17th, and Friday's
30th. ABC had no other prime-time programming.
   The Olympics also apparently helped ABC continue its three-week
win streak over CBS in news. For the week that ended Feb. 26, ABC's
``World News Tonight'' had an average rating of 11.7 and a 21
share. ``CBS Evening News'' had an 11.2 and 20 and ``NBC Nightly
News'' had 9.9 and 18.
   The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   ABC won the week that ended Feb. 28 with an average rating of
20.5. NBC was second with 15.6 and CBS third with 13.5. It was the
highest weekly rating for any network since October 1986, and ABC's
highest since October 1985.
   February is one of four months a year when local ratings are
measured for use in negotiating advertising rates. With only days
left uncounted in the February sweeps, ABC led NBC by about 1.5
rating points. CBS is third.
   NBC has an average 16.3 after 23 weeks of the television season.
ABC is second with 14.1, and CBS third with 13.6.
   The top 10 prime-time shows last week were: Saturday Olympics,
ABC; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC; Tuesday Olympics, ABC; ``A Different
World,'' NBC; Monday Olympics, ABC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS;
``Cheers,'' NBC; Thursday Olympics, ABC; ``Murder, She Wrote,''
CBS; and ``Matlock,'' NBC.
   The four-part miniseries ``Noble House'' ended disappointingly
for NBC. The final installment Wednesday night took a slight
upturn, but was only 20th.
   The first part of CBS' two-part ``Bluegrass'' did better, coming
in 15th with a 17.6 rating and 27 share.
   The annual rerun of the classic movie ``The Wizard of Oz'' on
CBS last Wednesday had its lowest rating yet, but still placed 25th
with a 15.3 and 22.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week _ the rankings were
abbreviated due to the Olympics taking up ABC's schedule, were:
``Wiseguy,'' ``Cagney & Lacey,'' ``Sonny Spoon,'' ``Charlie
Brown,'' ``Our House,'' ``Garfield,'' ``Equalizer,'' ``High
Mountain Rangers'' and ``West 57th,'' which was against the
Olympics Saturday night and got a dismal 5.5 rating and 9 share.

<HEAD>Immigration Changes to Affect Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department labor expert says
farmers probably will begin feeling the impact of a new federal
immigration law next year.
   Robert Coltrane of the department's Economic Research Service
said the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 exempts many
agricultural employers from penalties for knowingly hiring illegal
aliens, but that exemption will expire Dec. 1.
   ``The real test is likely to come after that time, when
penalties can be imposed and immigration investigators may take a
more aggressive approach to agriculture,'' Coltrane said.
   Coltrane, whose analysis is scheduled for the March issue of
Farmline magazine, said farm employers may be relying heavily on
the Special Agricultural Worker program, or SAW, which allows
temporary legal resident status for foreign workers who formerly
helped in the U.S. production of designated perishable crops.
   Producers of those crops are exempted from the law's penalties
until Dec. 1. As defined by USDA regulations, those crops include
not only fruits and vegetables, but also wheat, sugarbeets and a
number of other commodities.
   Coltrane said the main crops not qualifying as SAW commodities
are cotton, sugarcane, hay, sod, forage and silage, seed intended
solely for seed use, flax, millet and sorghum. Livestock producers
also are not covered by the SAW provision.
   The pool of SAW workers has been growing, although it is still
relatively small compared with total agricultural labor needs,
Coltrane said. In the first eight months of signup, June 1987
through January, around 240,000 workers filed SAW applications, the
first step to temporary legal residency and, under certain
conditions, eventual U.S. citizenship.
   But only about 2 percent of the SAW applications through
December were filed from outside the United States. Coltrane said
this means that temporary rules relaxing border restrictions to
bring in farm workers have not had much of an impact. Moreover,
there is no requirement that SAW workers stay with farm jobs.
   ``Once farm workers receive their work authorization card, they
can work wherever they want, and in whatever industry they want,''
he said. ``Agricultural employers have no assurance that the
workers will stay in agriculture.''

   The Soviet Union has used up virtually all of
its authorization to buy U.S. wheat at subsidized prices with
additional purchases totaling 500,000 metric tons for delivery this
year.
   Agriculture Department officials said Tuesday that the latest
sales, equal to about 18.3 million bushels, were handled by
Continental Grain Co., 100,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 375,000 tons;
and Mitsui Grain Corp., 25,000 tons.
   At recent prices averaging $2.75 per bushel, the wheat would
have a farm value of about $50 million.
   More than 6.8 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to
the Soviet Union under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP, for delivery in the year that began last Oct. 1.
   George J. Pope, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said that only 200 tons
of wheat are still available to the Soviet Union under current EEP
authorization. There has been no official indication that a new
line of subsidy may be approved.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   Pope said the subsidies, or bonuses, averaged $27 per ton on the
latest sales, or about 74 cents per bushel. The subsidies for the
Soviet Union have been available only for wheat.
   The sales also are part of the grain the Soviet Union is
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term
agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9
million tons of U.S. grain. The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases include a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have
the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or
soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _
up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans, or 39. bushels of corn.
   In addition, 2.62 million tons of U.S. corn, 813,300 tons of
soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by
the Soviets for delivery this year.

   Interest rates charged by the Agriculture
Department for price support crop loans made to farmers in March
will be 6} percent, down from 7[ percent previously.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's

<HEAD>The Iditarod Mushes Through Red Ink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the first musher charges north in
the 16th annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Saturday,
organizers already will have their own victory, over Alaska's
economic bust and the race's $773,000 debt.
   Fifty-five mushers have signed up for the rugged 1,100-mile
contest billed as ``the Last Great Race on Earth.'' Last year, 63
teams signed up; the year before, 73.
   This year's field includes four-time champion Rick Swenson;
two-time winner Susan Butcher, whose $50,000 winner's check last
year bounced; 1983 champion Rick Mackey; and 16 rookies. Mushers
from Austria, Canada, France and Great Britain also have signed up.
   The race is named after the Iditarod Trail, an old gold rush and
mail route to Nome. This year's race takes mushers over the tougher
northern route, where temperatures, although moderate of late, can
reach minus 50 degrees.
   Starting in downtown Anchorage on trucked-in snow, racers must
cross over the Alaska Range, traverse frozen tundra and climb the
timbered Kuskokwim Mountains to reach the Yukon River at Ruby, an
old gold mining community.
   The mushers trek south on the Yukon and turn toward the coast at
Kaltag. At Unalakleet, the teams turn north and run along the
windblown coast and sea ice to Nome's Front Street.
   The trail became part of Alaska's legends in 1925, when 20
mushers pushed for 127{ hours to relay diphtheria serum 674 miles
from Nenana to Nome to save the city from an epidemic.
   After the check issued Butcher bounced, a special audit in April
found the race was $773,000 in debt, said Rosemary Phillips, the
race's executive director.
   ``I suppose the economy had a lot to do with it,'' she said.
``The Iditarod was caught up in the collapse. More was spent than
was taken in.''
   Oil prices peaked at about $30 a barrel in 1985 but plunged to
less than $10 by July 1986. About 85 percent of the state's
revenues come from royalties and taxes paid by the oil industry.
When oil prices fell, the state's economy, heavily dependent on
state expenditures, went into the abyss.
   Bankruptcies and foreclosures soared. Property values tumbled,
jobs dried up and businesses closed, but the Iditarod, which relies
on private contributions, did not get the message.
   ``We had a hard time seeing our problem,'' said Iditarod Trail
Committee President Lavon Barve. ``There was a budget, and the
money was spent for that budget, but the money didn't come in.''
   Joe Redington, an Iditarod board member and race founder, said
the race was spending money for things it did not need. ``We spent
a lot of money and didn't pay no bills,'' he said. ``It was spent
unwisely. We had too many employees. We had top salaries and all
the benefits. We had better insurance than General Motors.''
   When the race's financial problems became known, officials cut
the staff by two-thirds. ``We had 34 to start with. The rest took
pay cuts. We cut all benefits,'' Phillips said.
   Joanne Potts, race coordinator since 1983, said about 700
volunteers, such as pilots and ham radio operators, worked for the
race last year. She expected about 1,200 this year.
   While cutting expenses, the race also has found new sponsors. A
footwear manufacturer's four-year sponsorship could bring in more
than $500,000, Phillips said. A dog food manufacturer agreed to a
one-year contract worth more than $25,000. A television network has
offered $15,000 for coverage rights.
   Merchandising the Iditarod name on everything from beer steins
to buttons makes up as much as 40 percent of the race's revenues,
she said.
   ``As of right now, our outstanding debts are about $220,000. I
think it's fantastic,'' Phillips said. This year's purse will be at
least $125,000, still the largest purse in sled dog racing, she
said.
   Potts said she never doubted the race would continue.
   ``There were people last June who didn't think we were going to
have a race this year,'' she said. ``We fooled them. We're going to
have one. It's just bigger than all the little problems we had last
year.''

<TEXT>
   And the winner is ...
   Michael Jackson? U2? Prince? Whitney Houston?
   The answer could be any and all of the above tonight at the 30th
Annual Grammy Awards, which return to New York City after a
seven-year absence and promise a number of special performances and
possible surprises.
   Jackson, who has four nominations, will perform his most recent
hit, ``Man in the Mirror,'' with an all-star backing cast including
Andrae Crouch, The Winans and Siedah Garrett. It is the superstar's
first televised live appearance in five years.
   The Grammys will be broadcast on CBS-TV from Radio City Music
Hall beginning at 8 p.m. EST.
   Not performing but likely to spend plenty of time on stage are
the Irish rockers U2, who garnered four major nominations and go
head-to-head with Jackson for album of the year.
   U2, whose album ``The Joshua Tree'' vaulted them to prominence
last year, also is up for record of the year, song of the year and
best rock vocal performance by a group or duo.
   Jackson has additional nominations for best male pop vocal
performance, best male rhythm and blues vocal performance and
producer of the year with Quincy Jones.
   Prince (``Sign O' the Times'') and Houston (``Whitney'') are
also up for album of the year, along with Dolly Parton, Linda
Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris for their ``Trio'' album.
   Prince also has been nominated for best rhythm and blues vocal
performance by a group or duo with Sheena Easton for ``U Got the
Look,'' which also garnered him a nomination for best rhythm and
blues song _ a songwriter's award.
   Houston, who will perform the nominated ``I Wanna Dance With
Somebody,'' is a potential winner in the categories best female pop
vocal performance and best female rhythm and blues vocal
performance.
   But there are lesser-known nominees with good chances at
capturing one of the tiny phonograph trophys handed out by the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
   New York's own Suzanne Vega, a cult favorite who broke into the
top 10 with her song ``Luka,'' is up for record of the year, song
of the year and best female pop vocal performance. Los Angeles'
favorite sons, Los Lobos, are nominated both for their inspired
remake of Ritchie Valens' ``La Bamba'' and their brilliant second
album, ``By the Light of the Moon.''
   Los Lobos will perform their version of ``La Bamba,'' a Mexican
folk tune adapted by the late Valens, at the awards show and Vega
is slated to do ``Luka.'' The only other nominee scheduled to
perform is best new artist hopeful Terence Trent D'Arby.
   D'Arby's competition includes Breakfast Club, Cutting Crew,
Swing Out Sister and Jody Watley.

<BYLINE>Critics Charge US-Canada Pact Leaves Auto Problems Unsolved</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A treaty to eliminate most tariff barriers
between the United States and Canada leaves disputes in the auto
industry unresolved, witnesses at a House hearing said.
   Lee Kadrich, director of governmental affairs and international
trade with the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, said
Tuesday the treaty was ``a lopsided agreement that sanctions
long-standing Canadian protectionism.''
   He told the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means
Committee that the treaty would put U.S. parts makers at the mercy
of foreign competitors.
   Automotive products, which account for about one-third of the
trade between the United States and Canada, have been governed for
more than 20 years by the Auto Pact, which gives duty-free
treatment to some parts and vehicles moving between the two
countries.
   Critics of the free-trade agreement, however, charge that
Canadian efforts to attract manufacturing have given their makers
an unfair advantage under the Auto Pact, and the agreement leaves
that advantage in place.
   ``Our current bilateral auto trade is skewed, to Canada's
benefit, by a number of trade-distorting practices,'' resulting in
part from Canada's domestic-content requirements and duty rebates
on some auto parts, said Rep. Sander Levin, a Southfield, Mich.,
Democrat.
   Steve Beckman, international economist for the United Auto
Workers union, said that the treaty, by retaining Canadian
production incentives for Honda, Toyota and Hyundai, provides ``a
subsidy of Canadian production, much of which will be sold in the
U.S.''
   An exception to that overall assessment was given by Thomas
Hanna of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which
represents auto manufacturers.
   Hanna said the treaty would create the world's largest
free-trade zone and ``takes on and resolves most of the trouble
spots which were developing in the bilateral auto trade.''
   He said concerns that the treaty would provide expanded entry
for Japanese and Korean manufacturers were unfounded because the
North American auto industry already has excess manufacturing
capacity.
   ``It makes no sense for the Canadian government to lure more
foreign auto investment, especially when much of the production
would be headed for the U.S. market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Helicopter Crash Probe Ends Without Probable Cause Determined</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board says
it was unable to determine what caused the crash in 1986 of a
helicopter scheduled to carry the entourage of Jordan's King
Hussein in which four people died.
   Investigators concluded that poor flying conditions, including
fog that caused limited visibility, were factors in the June 6,
1986, crash in Sutton, Mass. But the official probable cause was
listed as ``undetermined.''
   Dennis Jones, the lead investigator, said Tuesday the massive
disintegration of the helicopter hindered the inquiry. ``We're only
as good as the evidence,'' he said.
   ``There's no evidence to point to anything that we can
concretely say'' triggered the crash, NTSB spokesman Michael Benson
said.
   Investigators originally concentrated on a mysterious piece of
wire that raised questions of sabotage, but that turned out to be
part of an electrical testing instrument.
   The investigation later focused on what looked like a frayed
cable that controlled the tail rotor, which provides stability to
the craft. But the final report, issued Monday, said ``no
pre-impact part failure (or) malfunction was found.''
   Four employees of Sikorsky Aircraft were killed when the
seven-seat, Sikorsky-built S-76B helicopter went down on a trip
from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Mass., back to Sikorsky headquarters
in Stratford, Conn.
   The helicopter was one of four Sikorsky had provided to Hussein
during his New England visit, but the king, his family and aides
drove from Massachusetts to the Westover School in Middlebury,
Conn., for the graduation of his daughter, Princess Zeim, because
of the bad weather. Her twin sister, Princess Aisha, graduated from
the Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Mass., later that weekend.
   Sikorsky spokesman Marty Moore said the company supports the
board's findings.
   Benson said the crash illustrates the need for smaller aircraft
to carry ``black boxes,'' devices that would tape the crew's
conversations and possibly provide clues.
   The safety board has been pushing the Federal Aviation
Administration to require cockpit voice recorders in smaller craft,
including helicopters that seat at least six passengers. The FAA is
considering the proposed rules change.

   Scientists in two laboratories say they have
confirmed a report from researchers that a new kind of
superconducting material loses all resistance to electricity at a
record high temperature.
   Researchers at the University of Arkansas say the material
showed zero resistance at about minus 269 degrees Fahrenheit, more
than 20 degrees above previous widely accepted reports for stable
superconducting compounds.
   Paul Chu of the University of Houston said he had confirmed the
Arkansas results, finding zero resistance at minus 272 degrees. He
said his sample also expelled an applied magnetic field, a hallmark
of superconductivity called the Meissner effect.
   The results also have been confirmed by researchers at
International Business Machines Corp., said IBM spokesman Jerry
Present. He said he could not release details.
   Superconductivity is the ability to carry current without
resistance. Scientists are trying to make materials that become
superconducting at as high a temperature as possible, to make them
practical for uses in high-speed computers, bullet trains and other
applications.
   Higher temperatures than the Arkansas mark have been reported in
the press. But some have not been confirmed in other laboratories,
and others refer to the temperature at which a sample shows initial
signs of isolated pockets of superconductivity, rather than
superconducting pathways along its entire length.
   The new compound showed initial signs of superconductivity at
minus 238 degrees, said University of Arkansas researcher Allen
Hermann, who did the research with Zhenghi Sheng.
   That is slightly higher than the mark of about minus 243 degrees
recently reported for superconductors that include the element
bismuth rather than a so-called ``rare earth.''
   The Arkansas compound uses the element thallium rather than
bismuth or rare earth. Other ingredients are calcium, barium,
copper and oxygen.
   The results were announced to the press and at a scientific
meeting last month, but were not widely reported. They have been
accepted for publication in the British journal Nature, Hermann
said in a telephone interview.
   Chu said lessons from the thallium and bismuth compounds will
help in developing materials with still higher temperatures. He
also noted that the thallium compound showed zero resistance above
100 degrees on the Kelvin scale, giving a psychological boost for
hopes of higher temperatures.
   The 100-degree Kelvin mark corresponds to about minus 280
degrees Fahrenheit.
   Thallium is ``not quite practical'' for applications outside the
laboratory because it is toxic and in limited supply, he said.
   Hermann said he thinks thallium and bismuth eventually will be
abandoned in favor of new materials with higher temperatures and
better characteristics for applications.
   Brian Schwartz, physics professor at Brooklyn College, said the
Arkansas work is encouraging because it shows that substituting
elements in superconducting materials may lead to higher
temperatures.

   A federal court ruling expected today in
Boston could determine whether new regulations will go into effect
this week that cut off funds to family planning centers which
advocate or perform abortions.
   The months of debate continued Tuesday as Nabers Cabaniss,
deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human
Services, defended the administration proposals before members of a
family planning group challenging the regulations in court.
   Cabaniss told the gathering that the new Title X regulations
were not an attack on the family planning industry but a
reaffirmation of the administration's anti-abortion policy.
   Addressing the annual meeting of the National Family Planning
and Reproductive Health Association, Cabaniss said the new
regulations, due to go into effect tomorrow, would withhold funding
to centers in which ``abortion is a method of family planning.''
   ``We support family planning but not abortion on demand,'' she
said, urging the group to ``work together to separate family
planning from abortion.''
   Cabaniss said the regulations require so-called
``non-directive'' counseling, which offers pregnant women
information about their medical options with the exception of
abortion.
   If the facility also performs abortions, to keep Title X funding
for its other programs the clinic must maintain separate personnel,
separate accounting procedures, and provide different and clearly
defined waiting and treatment rooms for each type of patient.
   Among participants speaking out against the new Title X rules
was Dorothy P. Mann, executive director of the Family Planning
Council of Southeast Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She told
Cabaniss: ``We are not fools. Women won't come to programs that
can't help them.
   ``These regulations will destroy the family planning programs
and in doing so the lives of millions of poor women.''
   Since the regulations were published in the Federal Register
last month, two injunctions have been granted in courts in Denver
and New York. The Denver suit was brought by Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, while the New York court action was brought
by the American Civil Liberties Union.
   The Denver ruling covers all Planned Parenthood centers, and the
New York ruling covers clinics in that state.
   A third suit, filed by NFPRHA in U.S. District Court in Boston,
seeks an injunction to protect its publicly funded member clinics
and other family planning centers not covered by the other
injunctions.
   Scott Swirling, the association's executive director, said the
suit was filed to eliminate regulations he asserted ``are illegal,
violate the intent of Congress, violate medical ethics and could
harm the health care of almost 5 million poor women we serve.''
   If the Boston court agrees, the three preliminary injunctions
would stop the regulations from going into effect and give the
court time to look at the regulations and issue or deny a permanent
injunction, Cabaniss said.
   ``In this case we would expect some permanent ruling in March,''
she said, adding that the cases will end up in the Supreme Court.
   If the U.S. District Court in Boston denies the injunction, HHS
must decide whether to wait or implement the regulations affecting
those clinics not covered in the Planned Parenthood or New York
State suits.
   As head of the Office of Population Affairs, Cabaniss
administers the $140 million Title X program, which funds about
4,000 family planning centers. According to HHS statistics, 85
percent of the patients served by these centers are low-income and
one-third of them are adolescents.

   Work could begin this week on a $2.3 million
elevator that will allow visitors to view what is believed to be
the perch from which President John F. Kennedy was shot.
   The contract to build the elevator was awarded Monday by the
Dallas County Commission.
   The Dallas County Historical Foundation struggled to fund the
exhibit for the past 11 years, and plans to raise $1.5 million more
from private sources for additional renovations on the sixth floor
of the former Texas Schoolbook Depository.
   ``As sad as it is, it is the most important historical site in
Dallas,'' said Lindalyn Adams, president of foundation.
   The project includes construction of a six-story access tower
that will house the elevator and a one-story, ground-level exhibit
hall adjacent to the building.
   The exhibit, to be called ``The Sixth Floor,'' is expected to
attract an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 visitors annually.
   The Warren Commission determined that on Nov. 22, 1963, Lee
Harvey Oswald fired a high-powered rifle at Kennedy's motorcade
from the sixth floor of what is now the Dallas County
Administration Building, where he worked.
   Tony Callaway, a partner in the architectural firm of Hendrick
Callaway, said construction could be completed by November. But
foundation officials say they are unlikely to schedule the
exhibit's opening for Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's
assassination.
   ``We think it would be inappropriate,'' Ms. Adams said.

   About 30 of Israel's leading
entertainers staged a sing-in to protest the government's handling
of 12 weeks of Arab riots in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Shalom, shalom, we are making peace. There will be peace. We
are together beyond fear,'' they sang, swaying together on a stage
in front of Tel Aviv's City Hall.
   About 3,000 Israelis sang along in Hebrew to the tune of ``We
are the World.''
   The protesters also heard newly released peace songs and carried
placards that said ``We won't be a nation of bullies'' and ``Enough
of occupation.''
   The demonstration was held in Kings of Israel Plaza, site of a
protest by more than 100,000 Israelis in 1982 that helped lead to
Israel's pullout from Lebanon.
   Tuesday's protest was sponsored by Red Line, peace activists who
are staging a four-day march from Rosh Haniqra on the Lebanon
border to Jerusalem, where about 1,500 marchers are expected today.
   Three months of Arab rioting against the 20-year Israeli
occupation of their homelands has produced a crop of new protest
songs, the first since the end of Israel's three-year occupation of
Lebanon in 1985.
   Among the stars was Rita Fayrouz, the Iranian-born singer who
recently released ``A Song For Children.'' The lyrics say, ``he was
born of mother war, but deep in his heart, he just wanted to be a
poet.''
   A number of participants expressed disappointment at the
relatively small turnout. But Rami Kleinstein, a rock musician and
Ms. Fayrouz's husband, predicted ``change is going to happen.''
   One of the most critical songs was by Si Hyman, 26, who wrote
``Shooting and Crying'' to protest an incident last month in which
Israeli soldiers buried alive four Arabs in Kfar Salem. The victims
were rescued by relatives.
   Ms. Hyman sang:
   ``Shooting and crying, burning and laughing
   ``When did we learn to bury alive?
   ``Shooting and crying, burning and laughing
   ``When did we forget that we also had children killed?''
   In an interview after the performance, she said she was shocked
that ``this was done by the Jewish people who lived through the
Holocaust. I said to myself we've got to stop it.''

   Japan and Western Europe were rebuilt with
America's help after World War II and should now repay the United
States by picking up a larger share of NATO and Japanese defense
costs, according to a well-known historian.
   The comments Tuesday by Yale historian Paul Kennedy echoed other
calls by legislators and former government officials as President
Reagan flew to Europe for a two-day meeting of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Kennedy, author of ``The Rise and Fall of Great Nations,'' told
the Senate Budget Committee that calls for increased ``burden
sharing'' are part of the effort to find a way out of ever-growing
defense expenditures.
   Some American allies ``are now richer per capita than the USA,''
Kennedy said, adding that Japan and Western Europe ``ought to bear
a larger share of the defense burden.''
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the panel, agreed,
saying: ``It seems to me we are draining our power trying to do too
much. Our adversaries are happy to see us try. Our allies haven't
done as much as they can to help.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci also agreed at least in part
with Kennedy. At a House Budget Committee hearing earlier Tuesday,
he said, ``I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do
more.'' But he added that ``I don't think it is very useful to
simply berate the Europeans on this.''
   Carlucci told the House panel that he doesn't think NATO will
increase spending in response to complaints by Congress.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the committee, complained
about what he called ``unequal sharing'' by NATO countries. ``Our
allies in NATO are not doing, in my estimation, enough for their
own defense,'' he said.
   The United States is spending about 6 percent of its gross
national product on defense while no other countries in NATO are
above 3 percent, Gray said.
   Rep. Richard Durbin, R-Ill., said the average Japanese citizen
spends about $100 a year in taxes for defense, while the average
American spends $1,200.
   ``We need to make every effort to get our allies to do more,''
Carlucci agreed, but he added that they do more than is ``generally
recognized.'' He cited a statistic that NATO would supply 90
percent of the ground troops that would be used to halt a Soviet
non-nuclear attack.
   Carlucci said America's defense budget is 5.7 percent of the
nation's GNP, not 6 percent and he added that U.S. defense budgets
generally have stayed even or declined in recent years.
   NATO has long set a target for each member to increase spending
by 3 percent a year after inflation, and most nations don't meet
that target, Carlucci said. The United States hasn't met the 3
percent target for at least four years, he added.
   Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said NATO needs to improve its conventional
defenses in the wake of the treaty banning medium-range atomic
missiles from Europe.
   Crowe detailed NATO's shortcomings in non-nuclear weapons, but
added, ``surely the prospect of having to fight 16 nations at once
remains a sobering one for the Kremlin.''

   When Congress convened last July for
the first time in 15 years, it vowed to build democracy from the
ruins of authoritarian rule. Seven months later, critics say it has
been slow to address fundamental issues.
   The new constitution, drafted under President Corazon Aquino,
reestablished the bicameral, U.S.-style Congress. Former President
Ferdinand Marcos abolished Congress in 1972 and replaced it with a
single-chamber, rubber-stamp assembly.
   Members of the Senate and House of Representatives were elected
in May 1987, and Congress convened last July 27. Since then, more
than 6,000 bills have been submitted in the 23-member Senate and
the 202-member House.
   As of the end of February, only 13 had been enacted into law.
   ``The bills are not an indication of quality at all,'' said Rep.
Bonifacio Gillego. He said most were for local projects such as
roads, schools and hospitals.
   Meanwhile, legislation on major national issues, such as land
reform, has been bogged down by special interests and
organizational problems in the two chambers.
   Commentators and congressional sources disagree on why Congress
has not been more productive.
   Some complain that traditional politicians spend too much time
on ``peripheral'' topics or delivering lengthy speeches while
ignoring complex issues.
   ``It's part of the turmoil of transition, part of growing up,''
said opposition leader Wilson Gamboa, who was defeated for the
Senate last May. ``Vital issues of legislation that should have
far-reaching effects on the condition of the people have not been
addressed.''
   Some congressmen defend the slow pace, saying it is better to
take time with complicated issues than rush legislation which
members may later regret.
   ``We cannot afford to hurry that much and regret it later,''
said Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile. ``We're not just talking about our few
interests but a complex situation.''
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
also defended the slow pace.
   ``Is that what they want, faster laws but probably imperfect
laws?'' Maceda said in an interview. ``We're slower, but probably
all sides are heard.''
   Last month, eight Senators formed a ``conscience bloc'' and
publicly criticized Senate President Jovito Salonga for delays in
bringing legislation to the floor.
   One of the eight, Sen. Alberto Romulo, said economic and social
issues ``have not been given the importance they deserve.'' He
added, ``Our performance will be assessed by how much we have done
to improve the quality of life of our people.''
   Salonga promised to speed up Senate proceedings and reduce the
time allotted for speeches.
   Some congressmen also complain that the two chambers lack
sufficient staff and resources to provide members with detailed
information and advice on legislation.
   Many commentators view the current debate on land reform as a
test case of Congress' ability to legislate controversial issues
with far-reaching impact on national life.
   Last July, Mrs. Aquino decreed a nationwide land redistribution
program but left virtually all the difficult decisions, such as
compensation and retention limits, to Congress.
   She gave the lawmakers 90 days to approve the legislation, and
House Speaker Ramon Mitra boasted his chamber would meet the
deadline within 30 days. But neither the House nor the Senate has
approved a land reform bill, in part because of opposition by
landlord members.
   ``There has been considerable delay, almost intentional on the
part of the landlords to avoid the passage of an agrarian reform
bill,'' said Gillego, chairman of the House's Land Reform Committee.

<HEAD>Judge Says Drug Rulings Should Be Appealed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department should appeal a pair of
conflicting rulings on random drug testing for civilian government
employees in order to resolve the issue, says a judge responsible
for one of the decisions.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan on Tuesday ordered the Army
to stop random checks of 9,400 of its civilian employees for drug
use because the tests are an unreasonable search prohibited by the
Constitution.
   ``It is with some regret that the court removes what might be a
powerful weapon from the nation's arsenal in the campaign against
illegal drug use, but the values represented by the Constitution
and Fourth Amendment are transcendent,'' Hogan ruled.
   Hogan said random checks could not be justified by safety
concerns because the urine test used by the Army did not indicate
whether an employee was using drugs on the job.
   The ruling was made on three challenges brought by public
employees unions to the Army's 1986 order directing random drug
tests of civilians in sensitive jobs. The cases involved unions
representing civilians at Ft. Stewart, Ga., the Sharp Army Depot in
Lathrop, Calif. and guards at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.
   Noting that another federal judge in Washington last year upheld
random drug testing of nearly 30,000 Transportation Department
employees, Hogan invited the Justice Department to appeal his
decision.
   He also suggested that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
consolidate the two cases for a single review of ``a question of
exceptional importance.''
   Based on Hogan's invitation, ``we are reviewing the opinion and
are considering an appeal,'' said Amy Brown, a Justice Department
spokeswoman.
   On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to review a ruling by a
federal appeals court in New Orleans, which had upheld drug testing
of U.S. Customs Service employees who seek promotions.
   A federal appeals court in San Francisco last month ruled
unconstitutional the mandatory drug testing of railway workers
involved in accidents.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy says increases in the
government's food stamp program are needed to make up for Reagan
administration cuts that have helped create hunger in America
through the 1980s.
   ``The cold statistics only begin to measure the toll in terms of
the human lives damaged, disabled and destroyed by our shameful
abdication of responsibility in recent years,'' the Massachusetts
Democrat told a group of nutrition activists Tuesday.
   ``We have financed the greatest arms buildup in human history,
but once again we are losing the war on hunger,'' he said.
   Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, planned to introduce legislation today with Sen. Patrick
J. Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., that would
help ``right those wrongs.''
   ``I do not intend to accept proposals that seek to balance the
federal budget on the backs of poor children,'' he said. ``Survival
of the fittest may be the law of the jungle, but it is not the law
of America, and it is time for America to help.''
   Kennedy said his anti-hunger legislation would raise food stamp
benefits ``so that no Americans are forced to go hungry for the
last part of every month.''
   It also would ease food stamp eligibility requirements and
provide more public information about the program.
   Kennedy said hunger in America was largely eradicated by the
late 1970s, but ``misguided'' budget cuts under President Reagan
have ``rubbed salt in the wounds'' created by the recession of the
early 1980s, triggering the re-emergence of hunger.
   Earlier, Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn told the Food Research
and Action Center's annual conference that the nation needs a
``compassionate urban agenda.''
   Flynn, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Mayors' task force on
hunger and homelessness, said both problems are growing, especially
among families with children.
   ``The sad truth is that hunger is now more prevalent in our
nation than at any time since the Great Depression,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The underdog hero of the Winter Olympics, British
ski-jumper Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, has been offered a
recording contract and may soon appear in commercials endorsing a
brand of vodka.
   Edwards, who became the Olympics' favorite loser, flew home to a
hero's welcome Tuesday. He was the last man off the plane.
   A plasterer from Cheltenham, in southwest England, Edwards won
the hearts of this nation of underdog-lovers by finishing last in
ski-jumping events in Calgary. He arrived at Heathrow Airport with
the 100-member British team, some of whom wore ``Eddie The Eagle''
T-shirts.
   Edwards, 24, trooped into the airport to be greeted by
flower-throwing fans and an army of photographers, reporters and
television crews.
   ``I've made it, I've made it to the Olympics,'' The Eagle said.
``That's all I cared about.''
   Alfred and Catherine Heath, a retired couple from Wimbledon,
were among the well-wishers. ``We saw him on TV,'' said Heath. ``He
was just wonderful.''
   ``He's got guts,'' said John Ward, a transport executive. ``He's
captured the imagination of people.''
   Edwards was Britain's first ski-jumper in the Games for more
than 50 years.
   He finished last in both the 70-meter and 90-meter events, but
endeared himself to millions of armchair athletes with his gangly,
bemused clumsiness, enhanced by the thick glasses that gave him a
bird-like look.
   His hometown is planning a parade for him on Thursday.
   Edwards said he was suprised by all the publicity he received,
but said: ``I'm going to try not to let it get in the way.
Nothing's going to change. I'm still a jumper. I'm still training.''
   When he was asked if fame might go to his head, Edwards replied:
``I'll try not to let it.'' He confirmed, however, he intends to
cut a record titled ``Fly, Eddie, Fly.''
   Edwards signed up an agent, London music promoter Simon Platz,
who told a British TV interviewer The Eagle would cut the record
today. ``He says he can sing, and that's good enough for me,'' said
Platz.
   Edwards also was negotiating a deal to endorse Vladivar, a brand
of vodka.
   ``It's great to actually have somebody who's prepared to have a
smile at themselves _ and keep on coming last. That's very
important,'' Phil Staniforth, the vodka company representative,
told the interviewer.
   Critics had said Edwards should not have entered the Olympic
events because of the danger, but he said, ``I proved them wrong.''
   ``I've only been jumping two years, and the trainers I've talked
to say there's no reason I can't get into the top five. Hopefully,
I'll be a force to reckon with next year.''
   But in the meantime, Edwards said he wanted to get back to his
job as plasterer. ``It's a nice rest, plastering,'' he said.

   A stamp cancellation such as the British one

   The Postal Service's 74 division managers can approve special
cancellations for events of general public interest, said Dick
Rustin, manager of the Stamp Information Branch.
   The special cancellations may not deal with things only of local
interest or for political, religious, fraternal, trade or
commercial purposes, he said Tuesday.
   The British Post Office on Tuesday began postmarking nearly all
letters mailed in that country with the words ``Jesus Is Alive!''
as part of a private arrangement financed by an evangelist.
   Jewish leaders criticized the Christian cancellation as
potentially offensive.
   The special postmark, which also contains a small cross, will
last six weeks and was paid for by Paul Slennet, who sells
religious literature at two bookstores in Southend-on-Sea, east of
London. He said God told him to buy the postmark.
   The state-owned Post Office said Slennet paid the equivalent of
$88,500 for the privilege of having every letter mailed through 68
of Britain's 69 sorting offices with the Jesus message.
   Rustin said groups seeking the special cancellations have to pay
$900 for the engraving of the cancellation plus about $100 for each
canceling die to be used. For a large post office many dies can be
required, Rustin said.

<HEAD>Noriega Foes Move To Choke Panamanian Cash Flow, Freeze Assets in
US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it approves of
efforts by opponents of Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega
to freeze Panamanian assets in the United States and choke off
payments to the government.
   ``It's their action to take,'' State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said Tuesday, calling it ``the legitimate action of
the constitutional government in Panama.''
   Panamanian opposition leader Gabriel Lewis, a former ambassador
to Washington, said legal steps were being taken to freeze the
assets but he gave few details.
   Lewis said disclosing specifics of the plan could enable
Panamanian officials loyal to Noriega to take countermeasures.
   Juan B. Sosa, U.S. ambassador for Panama's president in hiding,
Eric Arturo Delvalle, released a proclamation from Delvalle calling
on all Panamanians not to engage in any financial transactions with
the authorities who seized power from him last week.
   The proclamation states that payment of debts, taxes and other
obligations should be withheld until constitutional government is
restored in Panama.
   The legal efforts in the United States were being handled by
William D. Rogers, a former assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs and an undersecretary of state for economic
affairs.
   The Panamanian National Assembly, dominated by forces loyal to
Noriega deposed Delvalle last Friday after the president had
attempted to fire Noriega as defense chief.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considering Staff Cuts at `Stars & Stripes'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials are studying a
reorganization plan for the ``Stars & Stripes'' military newspapers
that could change their printing schedules, introduce advertising
and cut back on staff.
   The reorganization plan, proposed to the Pentagon last fall by
an advisory task force but only recently released publicly, is now
being studied by the European and Pacific Commands, where the two
newspapers are published.
   The top military leaders of those commands are to file comments
with the Pentagon within the next week or so, allowing Defense
Department officials to make some final decisions on the fate of
the two newspapers, said William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman.
   Ultimately, Dan Howard, the assistant defense secretary for
public affairs, will decide whether to change the newspapers'
operation in consultation with Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
and Congress.
   The internal review comes at a time when the General Accounting
Office is conducting an independent investigation of alleged
censorship by military commanders at the papers. Congress, at the
prodding of Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., ordered that
investigation last December and is likely to study closely any
reorganization plan.
   The newspapers are published for American servicemen posted
overseas and date back to publication in France during World War I.
The papers' chief goal is to provide the same national and
international news available in the United States to troops
assigned to foreign countries.
   Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, there are two
separate editions of the Stars and Stripes, published by autonomous
bureaus in West Germany and Japan.
   The papers are staffed by military as well as civilian
journalists and report to the commanders of the European and
Pacific Commands. They are partially supported by taxpayer funds _
roughly $9 million in fiscal 1986.
   The Pentagon formed a seven-member ``Stars & Stripes Advisory
Task Force'' in the fall of 1986, asking for ideas on how to make
the operations more efficient. Named as chairman was Capt. Robert
A. Rosen, a longtime communications executive in private life who
is also a public affairs officer in the Naval Reserve.
   The 55-page report produced by the Rosen panel concludes that
the two newspapers are ``bringing to overseas DoD personnel a
balanced presentation of U.S. and international news along with
relevant DoD and Unified Command news, but at a high cost.''
   ``The task force saw areas where improvement in newspaper
quality and significant cost savings could be made.''
   The panel said the Pentagon should consider such things as
shifting from a seven-day-a-week schedule to a six-day-a-week
schedule; consolidation of management and procurement; paring
expenses on wire services by subscribing to only one; investing in
modern text-editing computers to improve staff efficiency; and
closely reviewing staff levels in any event.
   The newspapers are published in a similar fashion, yet the
editorial staff of the European edition is twice that of the
Pacific edition _ 87 to 41, the panel found.
   ``The task force came away with the distinct impression that the
European Stars & Stripes, and possibly the Pacific Stars & Stripes,
editorial departments were overstaffed,'' the report states.
   Most importantly, it is time to re-think the restrictions that
prevent the newspapers from accepting most forms of advertising,
the panel insisted. The two papers rely now primarily on their
25-cent subscription charge.
   The report said: ``The task force believes that the Congress and
the DoD must come to grips with the practical reality of what a
newspaper is _ namely a manufactured product that conveys news and
other information, including advertising information. ...
   ``Congress and DoD must apply that reality to the Stars and
Stripes so that the papers may better serve their readers and
become economically secure with a reduced need of appropriated
funds.''
   If the government is not willing to do that, ``it should either
resign itself to continued appropriated fund support ... or get out
of the daily newspaper business,'' the panel concluded.

<HEAD>Despite Criticism, Gephardt's Trade Message Seems To Be Working</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Gephardt stood in the bright
sunshine on the steps of the Capitol building and delivered the
message that has carried him to the front rank of the Democratic
presidential field.
   It was tough talk about trade and the problems of American
workers.
   His critics call Gephardt's message protectionist. They decry
the undeniable fact that this Washington insider is running against
the establishment.
   But the Missouri congressman appears to be getting a positive
response. No other candidate has a message that has caught hold so
effectively with a large portion of the Democratic Party electorate.
   Gephardt may fall short in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination. The party may turn to Gov. Michael
Dukakis' technocratic appeal, to Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s tough
defense and foreign policy message or to Jesse Jackson's
anti-establishment platform.
   But Gephardt's strong run for the nomination already has
delivered a message to the the party, one that might outlive his
candidacy.
   A strong tribute to the Gephardt message came in the Republican
presidential debate in Atlanta last Sunday when Rep. Jack Kemp of
New York turned to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and accused him of sounding
``just like Dick Gephardt.''
   When Dole campaigns in South Carolina he unabashedly supports
legislation to restrict textile imports. So does Pat Robertson.
   The reason is simple. Over 45 percent of the jobs in South
Carolina are in the textile industry and the state has lost 126
plants.
   A staple of the Gepardt message is reference to an editorial in
the Wall Street Journal that referred to the trade deficits as
``just a fact of life.''
   Then he said he'd like the editorial writer to come with him to
Bettendorff, Iowa, where 6,000 workers in three different
industries have recently lost their jobs because of foreign
competition.
   ``Sit across the table as I did from live human beings and have
them tell you what it's like to lose their life insurance, lose
their health insurance, lose their pension, what it's like to go
home and tell their families that they've lost their jobs, that
they're going to stand in an unemployment line or a welfare line,
to tell them it's just a fact of life,'' he said.
   He referred to electronics workers in New Hampshire and textile
workers in South Carolina and said, ``Ladies and gentlemen, I don't
like those facts of life.''
   He said it was time for America to ``get control of our economic
destiny,'' a powerful message to Americans who feel uneasy over the
nation's enormous trade deficits.
   Four years ago, Republicans derided as protectionist, Walter
Mondale's call for legislation that would require a certain portion
of foreign products to be manufactured in the United States,
so-called domestic content legislation.
   The label stuck. It was special interest legislation, a bad
thing for the country.
   But during the four years since that election, the situation has
not improved and more and more people are feeling they are a part
of that special interest.
   Two former governors of South Carolina _ Robert McNair and
Richard Riley _ stood with Gephardt on the Capitol steps and
endorsed his candidacy.
   Both felt compelled to defend the congressman against charges he
is protectionist.
   McNair said Gephardt has ``faced up to putting America first
with a fair, sound and sensible trade bill. ... It is not a piece
of protectionist legislation as some have tried to portray it, but
it is what is best for this country.''
   ``Dick Gephardt has spoken out during this campaign on trade and
some have referred to him as a protectionist,'' said Riley. ``He's
not a protectionist at all, he's a pragmatist.''

<HEAD>Gephardt, Dole Head Candidates Receiving PAC Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Bob Dole received more money from
political action committees than all the other presidential
candidates, while Democrat Richard Gephardt, who has portrayed
himself as anti-establishment, leads in PAC contributions among his
party's hopefuls.
   Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, accepted $337,698 in
contributions from PACs, including those representing First
Republican Bank Fund, Prudential-Bache Securities and E.F. Hutton &
Co., now a part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Dole, a senator from Kansas, has received $645,190 in
contributions from PACs representing banking institutions, utility
companies and other groups, according to a report issued Tuesday by
Congress Watch.
   Vice President Bush has received the second-highest amount with
$559,895; Rep. Jack Kemp has gotten $57,766, and the other
Republican candidate, former television evangelist Pat Robertson,
has not accepted any PAC contributions, the report said.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was second among the Democrats
with $174,934 in PAC money, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon was third
with $152,250. Jesse Jackson accepted $47,925 in PAC contributions,
the report said.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart have said they do not accept PAC money.
   Gephardt was roundly criticized on the subject by several of his
rivals in a debate Monday night in Williamsburg, Va.
   And the Dukakis campaign has prepared anti-Gephardt ads that
communications director Leslie Dach described this way: ``He says
he is leading the little guy's fight, but his campaign is financed
and supported by the big guys. His biggest contributors are
America's biggest corporations.''
   Congress Watch, which issued the report, is the legislative arm
of Public Citizen, the liberal organization founded in 1971 by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader. The group based its report on
Federal Election Commission documents from October 1987 and
campaign contributions through Jan. 31 of this year.
   Monday night, Dukakis took Gephardt to task for accepting PAC
contributions while ``racing around the country beating up on the
establishment.''
   Gephardt said he had often voted against the policies advocated
by his contributors and ``to suggest that people have voted
according to the wishes of people who have given them money, I just
think is out of touch with reality. I haven't done that and I know
you haven't done that.''
   But Jackson said Gephardt's contention that he ignored the
wishes of his contributors was unrealistic.
   ``Lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave money
continuously against the interests of who they were working for,''
Jackson said.
   Among contributors to Gephardt's campaign were the Builders PAC
Association, $5,000; First Republican Bank Fund, $5,000;
Prudential-Bache Securities, $2,500; Mercantile Bank Corp., $1,000,
and E.F. Hutton, $1,500.
   Election law limits each PAC to contributions of no more than
$5,000 to any one candidate, in contrast to the limit for
individual contributions of $1,000.
   Gore received contributions from PACs representing Coca-Cola
Bottling Co., $2,500; Lockheed Corp., $1,000; the Sheet Metal
Workers, $5,000, and Pacific Telesis, $1,500.
   Dole's PAC contributors included American Telephone & Telegraph
Co., $5,000; H & R Block, $1,000; Shell Oil, $5,000; Union Oil,
$5,000, and Federal Express, $2,000.
   According to FEC documents released last year, Dole led his
Senate colleagues with a total of $3.3 million received from PACs
since he entered Congress in 1968.
   Of that, about $1 million was raised from PACs for the Kansas
senator's re-election campaign in 1986.
   Bush accepted contributions from PACs representing Citicorp,
$2,250; CSX Transportation, $1,000, and Manufacturers Hanover,
$2,000.

   Bill Greene of The Boston Globe and Anthony
Suau of Black Star were chosen the top newspaper and magazine
photographers of the year in the 45th annual Pictures of the Year
competition at the University of Missouri.
   The top photo essayist award went to Herman Leroy Emmet, a New
York City free-lancer who won for a seven-year documentary focusing
on migrant workers.
   Bill Kuykendall, director of the Pictures of the Year
competition, said Tuesday that a record 1,995 photographers entered
more than 37,000 photographs in what he called ``the world's

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange surged closer to pre-crash
levels today, setting a new 1988 record for volume, while the
dollar fell slightly.
   ``Foreign buying and a bullish economy in the United States have
convinced domestic investors to join in,'' said a market analyst
who requested anonymity, adding that the strength of the market has
been surprising.
   ``Latecomers have been trying to catch the bus. I would be
concerned if turnover like today's continued, though, because it
could show that the market is overheating,'' he said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
25,682.82 points, up 246.92 points, or 0.97 percent from Tuesday's
close. Volume in the first section was 1.7 billion shares, a record
high for this year.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 128.47 yen,
down 0.16 yen from Tuesday's close of 128.63 yen. The dollar opened
today at 128.43 yen.
   A currency dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who also
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dollar was trading in a
narrow range in the absence of major market-moving news.
   Trading on the first section of the exchange totaled 900 million
shares at the end of the morning session, before closing the day
100 million shares higher than the previous 1988 record, set
Tuesday.
   Prior to the October crash, the Nikkei index stood at 25,746.56.
   ``Institutional investors are responding positively to the
favorable outlook for the economic performance of Japanese firms in
this fiscal year,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama, a dealer with Wako
Securities.
   Yoneyama said corporate earnings of major firms were expected to
show better-than-expected results in fiscal 1987, which ends March
31.

<HEAD>League Of Women Voters Cancels Presidential Debates In Nashville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The League of Women Voters called off
Democratic and Republican debates scheduled for Sunday after
presidential candidates in both parties showed little or no
interest in attending.
   ``In essence, the candidates are snubbing nearly half the
country two days before this critical election,'' said Carole Bucy,
president of the League of Women Voters of Nashville.
   The debates, which were to have been telecast from Nashville by
Cable News Network, would have come only two days before the
20-state round of caucuses and primaries on March 8, or Super
Tuesday.
   League spokeswoman Janice Kaplan had said earlier in the day the
Democratic debate was definitely on and the Republican debate would
proceed even if there were only two candidates.
   The cancellation followed indications by Republican Bob Dole
that he was unlikely to join Jack Kemp for a two-man debate.
   In Knoxville, where Dole spoke to a downtown rally, press
secretary Walt Riker said he doubted seriously that Dole would
participate in the rally without Vice President George Bush.
   Bush and Pat Robertson, a former television evangelist, both
advised the League they would not show up.
   Ms. Kaplan said Rep. Richard Gephardt ``told us this week he did
not want to debate in (Tennessee Sen.) Albert Gore's back yard,
even though he has known all along the debate was in Nashville.''
   Ms. Bucy said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had decided not
to participate.
   Gore's chief campaign spokesman, Mike Kopp, chided Gephardt and
Dukakis passing up the debates here. Both of them also skipped a
debate last Sunday in Houston.
   Kopp said Gephardt and Dukakis ``participated fully in the
debates that preceded the Iowa caucuses. Now these same candidates
are dodging these (Nashville and Houston) debates where they have
to talk about the issues.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, who has said he would not campaign actively in
Southern-dominated Super Tuesday states, was apparently planning on
taking part in the Nashville debate.
   Other Democrats in the running are Jesse Jackson and former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart.

Delegates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole picked up a delegate and
another was slated uncommitted as Wyoming's GOP presidential
delegation selection process got under way.
   Republicans in two counties met Tuesday to select two of the
state's 18 delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   Most of the rest of the GOP delegates and 13 of the state's 18
Democratic delegates will be selected Saturday, three days before
Super Tuesday.
   Despite the emphasis on campaigning in the South, Wyoming was
getting some attention from the candidates.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis both planned stops in the state before Saturday's county
conventions. Gary Hart, who is from neighboring Colorado, has
visited.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt bought radio ads in Wyoming, the first
time a candidate has advertised his candidacy over the airwaves.
   None of the Republican candidates were expected in the state,
where Vice President Bush and Sen. Bob Dole were considered the
frontrunners.
   Natrona and Platte counties were the first to allocate
presidential delegates Tuesday, with eight other counties ready to
select their GOP delegates on Saturday.
   The Natrona County delegate, Judy Catchpole, said she was
committed to Dole; the Platte County pick, Natty Dodge, was
uncommitted.
   Weston County Republicans planned to choose their delegate
Friday and Niobrara County party members were to do the same on
March 12.
   The final six presidential delegates will be selected at the
state Republican convention on May 7 in Cheyenne. All 23 Democratic
presidential delegates will be selected Saturday at county
conventions throughout the state.
   Gore already received the support of former Gov. Ed Herschler
and another of the state's five ``super delegates,'' who can remain
uncommitted going into the Democratic National Convention in July.

   Former President Jimmy Carter said there's an
even chance that none of the Democratic presidential candidates
will have a lock on the party's nomination before the national
convention in July.
   Carter, who has not endorsed any of the candidates, received a
visit Tuesday from one of the hopefuls, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, who characterized the meeting as a non-political call on
``an old friend.''
   ``My hope is that out of the primary and caucus season will come
a clear winner,'' Carter said just one week before 20 states, most
of them south of the Mason-Dixon line, hold primaries and caucuses
with 1,307 delegates at stake.
   ``I'm not sure that's a likelihood now,'' he said.
   Carter made it clear he is not one of those waiting for some
other candidate to enter the race _ a Mario Cuomo, Bill Bradley or
even Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn.
   ``I would not personally favor turning to someone outside the
active candidate group for the nomination,'' said the former
president.
   Carter explained his decision not to endorse any of the party's
contenders, saying ``it is better for us not to take a preferential
position among the Democratic candidates.''
   He said the only Democrat he might have thrown his support
behind was Nunn, who decided against entering the race.
   Carter talked about the Democratic race and Super Tuesday after
meeting at his rambling brick home with Gephardt, one of six
Democratic aspirants for the presidency.
   Gephardt denied he had any political motive for his trip to this
tiny Georgia town Carter put on the map.
   ``I didn't come here to try to be helped on Super Tuesday,''
said Gephardt, who stopped in Georgia on a trip from Williamsburg,
Va., to Columbia, S.C.
   ``I came here today not to enhance my prospects, but to greet an
old friend,'' he said.
   Gephardt, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, stood on the front walk
of the former president's home at 1 Woodland Road. His hair much
whiter than when he left the White House in January 1981, Carter
wore an open-necked checked shirt, a tweed jacket and khaki pants.
   Asked if he missed all the attention of a political campaign,
Carter laughed and said he and his wife had just returned from
skiing in Colorado.
   But he was also willing to answer questions as long as reporters
had any to ask.
   Carter was careful to say something nice about all the
Democratic candidates, and suggested that any one of them could do
well in the South.
   ``I'm sure Sen. (Albert) Gore (of Tennessee) will have an
advantage among some voters because he's a Southerner,'' said
Carter. The former president's daughter, Amy, has endorsed Jesse
Jackson.
   ``Amy doesn't ask me for counsel,'' he said, when asked if she
had discussed her position with him.

   Texas women extended their reign over the
Miss USA pageant to a fourth consecutive year as a beaming Courtney
Gibbs took the crown in a contest marred by arrests, an assault and
protests.
   Pageant spokeswoman Stacy Sacco said she was stunned by the
Texas victory record and felt compelled to assure reporters Tuesday
night that the contest televised nationally by CBS was not rigged.
   The woman who started the winning streak in 1985, Laura
Martinez-Herring of El Paso, did a little jig after Ms. Gibbs was
crowned, and echoed the sentiments of many pageant-watchers: ``I
just feel sorry for the next Miss Texas.''
   Ms. Gibbs, a 21-year-old junior at Texas Christian University,
smiled broadly when outgoing Miss USA Michelle Royer of Keller put
the crown on her head.
   ``It feels fabulous,'' the blue-eyed brunette said calmly,
seemingly unsurprised by her victory.
   ``One of the gifts Michelle (Royer) gave me was a dictionary
with the word `impossible' whited out. So of course it was
possible,'' she said.
   The pageant made the news weeks before the coronation: Bob
Barker ended his 21-year reign as host to protest the awarding of
furs to the winner and use of furs during the show. The first two
Miss Minnesotas bowed out after it was disclosed they had been
arrested. Animal-rights protesters picketed the El Paso Convention
Center. And co-host Tracy Scoggins fought off an attacker in a
hotel elevator.
   Ms. Gibbs of Fort Worth beat Diana Magana, 22, of Rancho Palos
Verdes, Calif., who was first runner-up. It was one of two best
possible results for Guyrex Associates of El Paso, the company that
produces the Miss Texas-USA and Miss California-USA contests and
hones those winners' pageant skills for the Miss USA contest.
   Ms. Gibbs, who won about $200,000 worth of prizes, including a
mink coat and jacket, will represent the United States in the Miss
Universe pageant May 23 in Taipei, Taiwan. Ms. Magana, a brown-eyed
brunette, will represent the United States in the Miss World
pageant.
   Second runner-up Tuesday was Donna Rampy, 24, of Riverdale, Ga.;
followed by Monica Farrell, 23, of Jacksonville, Fla.; and Dana
Michele, 20, of Richmond, Miss.
   Officials did not rank the other five semifinalists: Gina
Zordani, 23, of Illinois; Rowann Brewer, 23, of Maryland; Tamara
Walker, 18, of Oklahoma; April Abel, 20, of South Carolina; and
Stephanie Potts, 23, of Tennessee.
   The 11 judges scored each semifinalist on interviews and on the
swimsuit and evening gown competitions. The five highest scorers
became finalists.
   Miss Minnesota, Julie Nelson, was the second runner-up in her
state's contest, but the first two finishers, Sue Bolich and Jolene
Stavrakis, quit the Miss USA pageant after it was disclosed they
had been arrested in separate shoplifting incidents.
   About 25 animal-rights activists peacefully picketed the pageant
to protest the mink awards. Members of Sangre de Cristo Animal
Rights contend that fur ranching and trapping are cruel to animals.
   Bob Young, director of the group's Las Cruces, N.M., chapter,
asked co-host Alan Thicke to resign as Barker did to protest the
awarding of the fur coats. But Thicke refused, saying the furs were
taken from ranch-raised minks that were treated humanely.
   In the pre-pageant incident, the man accused of attempted sexual
assault in the attack on Miss Scoggins last week was released on
$100 bail. Prosecutors usually ask for $15,000 bail for such
third-degree felonies.
   A state judge ordered Pedro Concepcion Padill, 35, of El Paso,
re-arrested and imposed $100,000 bail, which he posted.
   The associate municipal magistrate who imposed the original bail
was suspended and is under investigation, police said.

   Republican George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis, on New England home ground, triumphed in Vermont's
``beauty contest'' primary, but Jesse Jackson and Bob Dole had
reason to celebrate as well as the presidential pack headed into
the final days of the Super Tuesday campaign.
   ``Our message continues to win,'' Jackson exulted after
finishing a strong second in Vermont, which has only a tiny black
population. Jackson garnered 26 percent to Dukakis' 57 percent.
   Dole, outspent and out-organized, nonetheless made an impressive
showing, gaining 39 percent to Bush's 49 percent in what his
campaign called the vice president's ``back yard.'' Bush has a
summer home in Maine.
   Still, the vice president pronounced himself pleased.
   ``This win gives us three out of three in New England, and I'm
hopeful we can be as successful this Saturday in South Carolina and
on Super Tuesday,'' said Bush, who was campaigning in Florida.
   No delegates were at stake in the Tuesday primary. Delegate
selection begins at local caucuses next month and representatives
of the Dole campaign said they would work now on organizing for the
caucuses.
   Dukakis, fresh from a weekend win in Maine's Democratic caucus,
was buoyant about his victory.
   ``It's terrific, we're rolling 'em up,'' said the Massachusetts
governor, who was campaigning in Baltimore. With a strong
organization and the endorsement of Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Dukakis
had been expected to do well here.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who has been Dukakis' chief opponent in
some recent contests, trailed with 8 percent. Gephardt backers said
his poor showing was caused by a lack of spendng in the state by
his national campaign.
   ``Dukakis and Jackson both made a decision to compete,'' said
Lt. Gov. Howard Dean, Gephardt's state chairman. ``You can't
overcome national organizations with just a Vermont organization.''
   Some political observers had predicted a tight race between
Jackson and Gephardt for second place, but Jackson stole the show.
He ran a strong second in the state's largest city of Burlington
and actually beat Dukakis in 27 communities and tied him in two.
   ``We have found the common chord that is linking the American
people,'' said Jackson from his mother's home in Greenville, S.C.
   ``It's putting to rest once and for all that he is candidate for
black people,'' said Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders, a Jackson
backer. ``We are the whitest state in America. I think it's an
extraordinary showing.''
   In unofficial results, with 100 percent of the state's 262
precincts reporting, Dukakis had 28,244 votes or 57 percent;
Jackson 13,030 votes or 26 percent; Gephardt 3,968 votes or 8
percent; Simon 2,596 votes or 5 percent and Hart 2,052 votes or 4
percent.
   Bush received 23,550 or 49 percent; Dole got 18,636 or 39
percent; former television evangelist Pat Robertson 2,447 votes or
5 percent; Rep. Jack Kemp 1,866 votes or 4 percent. Dropouts Pete
du Pont and Alexander Haig received 794 votes, or 2 percent and 327
votes or 1 percent respectively.
   The Robertson and Kemp campaigns put up little effort in the
state, although Robertson plans to compete in the caucuses.
   ``I really didn't contest it,'' said Robertson, in Orlando, Fla.
``We had virtually no organization in Vermont.''
   In years past, Vermont's primary won national media attention
because of its timing. Candidates could use a victory in the state
to build momentum following a victories in New Hampshire or Iowa.
Or, they could try to repair an image wounded by a loss in either
of those two states.
   But the timing element worked against the state this year.
Because no delegates were being allocated, the candidates
practically ignored the state to concentrate on the mega-delegate
race in the South.
   The primary was part of the state's annual ritual, Town Meeting
Day, when Vermont's voters decided town budgets, road repairs and a
host of other local issues. Turnout was lower than expected, with
just under 100,000 venturing to the polls.

   Vermont residents used their annual town
meetings to bolster efforts to save family farms and grapple with
growth.
   One town voted to exempt silos from property taxes and another
declared its population growth rate too high.
   The votes Tuesday reflected concern that Vermont's rural
heritage is being gobbled up by condominiums, resort developments
and vacation homes. That issue was the focus of a special
commission created by Gov. Madeleine Kunin that recommended a
comprehensive package of legislation to control growth and save
open land.
   The town meetings, a mainstay of local government in which
residents vote on town budgets and perennial issues such as road
repairs, took up the growth controversy during debates of zoning
regulations, expansions of planning staffs and other proposals.
   Pawlet residents voted 249-178 to exempt farm silos from the
property tax, though proponents ackowledged it would mean a savings
of only $200 a year for each of the town's 17 farms.
   ``It's going to be a combination of these little things that
keep the farmers going,'' said state Rep. Perry Waite.
   In Wallingford, residents tried to go even further, approving a
proposal to exempt local farms from paying any property tax on farm
land or buildings.
   For technical reasons the vote was not binding, said Board
Chairman Robert Barker.
   ``We determined, though, the selectmen have the authority to
institute this program,'' he said. ``And I think there's support
for it. I'm for it.''
   In Woodstock, residents were asked to recommend a preferred
population growth rate for the community, ranging from 0.66
percent, the highest annual growth rate the town had between 1890
and 1970, to 2.5 percent, the average so far this decade.
   They opted for the middle range of 0.9 percent, far below the
present growth rate.
   ``If the populace makes it loud and clear it doesn't want rapid
growth, perhaps the town could control growth by setting up certain
conservation areas, or by steering patterns of development and
population densities,'' said John Wiggin, a member of a group
studying growth in the community.
   Growth wasn't the only issue on the minds of voters at town
meetings. In Corinth, the question of the day was whether the tiny
hamlet at the town center is called Cookville or Cookeville.
   Town Clerk Jack Learmonth had asked for the vote because of
disagreements throughout history. ``Henceforth, it will be
Cookeville,'' he said following the vote.

   Jesse Jackon returned to his boyhood
hometown as he headed down the home stretch to the Super Tuesday
showdown, buoyed by another strong showing in a northern state.
   ``Our message continues to win,'' the Democratic presidential
candidate said when he learned Tuesday night that he had finished
second in Vermont's ``beauty contest'' primary.
   Jackson was surrounded by family, staff and reporters enjoying a
home-cooked Southern style meal when word of his showing reached
him.
   ``We have found the common chord that is linking the American
people where they are in Iowa or Maine or New Hampshire of
Minnesota or South Carolina,'' he said.
   Jackson is hoping that the inroads he has made among white
voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Maine _ all states
with 1 percent or less black voting age population _ will continue
in the March 8 series of primaries across 20 states, most of them
in the South.
   Jackson is expected to run well on Super Tuesday, especially in
the deep South with its heavy black population. But the campaign
also is targeting the working class, students, gays and other
minorities.
   Jackson acknowledged upon arriving in South Carolina, which
holds its primary Saturday, that the South is different than the
states that have voted so far. But he said, ``I'm a son of the
South ... I know the South and its ways.''
   He said his message _ attacking multinational corporations and
appealing to the economically oppressed _ would remain the same as
he campaigns in the South.
   Arriving at the Greenville airport, Jackson highlighted the
plight of textile workers who have been hurt by U.S. industry
taking its operations overseas.
   He said that when he was a youth, Greenville was the textile
capital of the world and was filled with mills, now closed down.
   Jackson said the customs laws must be enforced to keep foreign
products from entering the country illegally, and he called for
adjustment of the exchange rates by South Korea and Taiwan so those
nations cannot receive inflated prices on their goods.
   Jackson also defended his leadership qualifications which have
come under attack from Democratic rival Tennessee Sen. Al Gore Jr.
because Jackson has never held an elected or appointive government
post.
   Speaking to a Baptist convention at the Springfield Baptist
Church where his mother sang in the choir when he was a boy,
Jackson repeated his oft-stated claim that he knows the American
people better than any other candidate. He also gave a litany of
foreign leaders he has met, labor strikes he has mediated and civil
rights causes he has championed.
   ``I'm not propped up by aides,'' he said, adding that he can
speak to the poor because ``I was born in the underclass.''
   Earlier, in Washington, Jackson met with the South African
ambassador to protest Pretoria's new clampdown of anti-apartheid
factions and arrest of dissident religious leaders, including
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Jackson told a news conference later that the ambassador, Piet
G.J. Koornhof, asked for a follow-up meeting with Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., who attended the meeting and who is sponsoring
legislation on sanctions against South Africa because of its
apartheid policy of racial separation.
   The ambassador did not join Jackson and Dellums at the news
conference.
   Jackson said U.S. corporations and banks should be ordered to
leave South Africa. And he called on the Reagan administration to
convene special United Nations Security Council session
international support for full sanctions against Pretoria.
   He also called for suupport of the frontline states around South
Africa and aid in constructing trade corridors so Zimbabwe and
Zambia would not be dependent on South African trade routes.
   He said he had phoned national security adviser Colin Powell and
urged that the issue be raised with North Atlantic Treaty
Organization allies.
   Jackson said Powell told him there was ``a sense of outrage'' in
the administration about the recent crackdown in South Africa and
that Reagan would so state if the matter was brought up at the NATO
meeting.

   George Bush had a nearly 3-to-1 lead over
rival Bob Dole among Republicans likely to vote in Super Tuesday's
16 primaries, while Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson were battling
for the lead in the Democratic contests, according to poll results
published today.
   The vice president held a strong lead in virtually all the 16
states holding primaries next Tuesday, according to the Washington
Post-ABC News poll. He had the support of nearly 60 percent of the
946 likely Republican voters surveyed, while the Kansas senator had
just over 20 percent.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson trailed with slightly
more than 10 percent and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York had 5 percent.
   In a survey of 1,121 likely Democratic voters in the 16 primary
states, Jackson had an edge in Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and
North Carolina and was roughly tied with Dukakis in Arkansas,
Florida, Texas and Virginia.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, held a strong lead in his
home state, Rhode Island and Maryland. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. led in Tennessee and Kentucky, and Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt was ahead in his home state.
   Louisiana voters appeared to be split among Jackson, Dukakis and
Gore, and Oklahoma was a three-way contest among Dukakis, Gore and
Gephardt.
   When the survey was conducted Feb. 17-28, Dole was running even
with Bush only in Missouri and Maryland. In the next-closest states
of Arkansas and Rhode Island, he was a little more than 10
percentage points behind Bush.
   The newspaper said the poll results had ``varying margins of
error,'' but did not provide them.

   A pop-up scarecrow and a snowplow-proof
mailbox were just some of the gizmos displayed at the second-annual
North Dakota Inventors Congress.
   Peter Konzak of Devils Lake rummaged through the clutter of his
briefcase and found a letter to prove his scarecrow has already
earned him some attention.
   ``I am still invited to the Johnny Carson show. It is a standing
invitation,'' the 66-year-old retired farmer said.
   Forty inventors and manufacturers, most of them from North
Dakota, showed off their gadgets and thingamajigs at the show,
which ended Tuesday.
   The hinged mailbox was devised by a Minot man after a neighbor
complained about his mailbox getting knocked down by snowplows each
winter.
   Konzak's pride and joy stood at one side of his booth on the
floor of the Jamestown Civic Center. It's a steel contraption
wearing fluorescent work gloves that sports a dummy's head adorned
with a cowboy hat. A battery and propane tank give it life.
   In a sunflower field, the clumsy-looking ``pest-scaring device''
jumps up, twirls and whistles to keep blackbirds from feasting on
the seeds, Konzak said Monday.
   ``All you need is one on 40 acres,'' he said. ``With the buzzer
in here and all the stuff, it can pay for itself in one year.''
   Since receiving a patent for his mechanical scarecrow in April
1986, Konzak has made about 30 of them and sold them all at about
$500 apiece, he said.
   But he said he hasn't made any money yet. ``I've just made my
expenses. I put $20,000 into patenting this thing.''

   When Guam Gov. Joseph F. Ada checked out of a
Washington hotel earlier this week, the hotel declined to take a
Guam government check for payment of room charges.
   ``The hotel management said it couldn't accept the check because
Guam is a foreign country,'' Ada said Tuesday during a stop in
Honolulu on the way home.
   ``We told them that Guam is a U.S. territory where America's day
begins.''
   Guam long has been an unincorporated U.S. territory in the
western Pacific, about 3,800 miles west of Hawaii.
   ``They said they would give me credit because I was attending
the National Governors Association meeting,'' he said. ``What the
hotel didn't realize is that they will receive the same government

   The president of Connecticut's
third-largest bank is trading his pin stripes for dancing tights to
help promote corporate support of the arts.
   David Carson, 53, president and chief executive officer of
People's Bank in Bridgeport, will play the role of the Duke of
Courland in the ballet ``Giselle,'' to be performed March 11-12 by
the Connecticut Ballet Theater in Stamford.
   The production also will feature Stephanie Saland, principal
dancer with the New York City Ballet.
   ``The bank has supported the theater, but I think you can
support the arts with not just money, but with your presence,
too,'' said Carson.
   The ballet was looking for ``a very regal type of person,'' and
it decided to approach Carson, said Brett Raphael, the company's
artistic director.
   ``It occurred to me that this was natural casting if possible,
however far-fetched,'' Raphael said. ``It's not every day a
corporate personality takes time out of his schedule to dabble in a
very different art form.''
   Said Carson, ``It appealed to my sense of humor, and if it helps
give the ballet some recognition, that's great.''
   Carson will do some mime and walk to music, rather than dance.
But, he asked, ``When does walking in time become dancing?''

<HEAD>Mail Bearing `Jesus Is Alive' Postmark Delivered Today</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Post Office today began delivering mail
bearing the postmark ``Jesus is Alive!'' throughout Britain, a move
that Jews, humanists, the National Secular Society and others
called offensive to other beliefs.
   ``It is absolutely outrageous,'' said Martin Horwood, spokesman
for the British Humanist Association, a national organization for
the non-religious.
   ``Imagine the furor if we had asked to have `Jesus is Dead'
printed on hundreds of millions of letters. We might think these
things privately, but they should not be forced on everybody else
in such an insensitive way,'' he said.
   Horwood said he is writing to Post Office chairman Sir Brian
Nicholson asking for the postmark to be withdrawn.
   Christian evangelist Paul Slennet privately financed the
arrangement with the Post Office. Slennet, 41, sells Christian
literature at two bookstores in Southend-on-Sea, east of London. He
said God told him to buy the postmark.
   The six-week arrangement runs through Good Friday, April 1, when
Christians mourn the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and Easter Sunday,
April 3, when they celebrate his resurrection.
   Slennet was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying he was
convinced ``the Lord will speak to the nation'' through the scheme,
which he said was designed to mark Easter.
   ``We are not trying to offend people in any way,'' the paper
quoted Slennet as saying.
   But Shimon Cohen, spokesman for Lord Jakobovits, the chief rabbi
of Britain, said: ``It could well cause offense and resentment.
We've made our feelings known to the Post Office.''
   The state-run Post Office began using the postmark on mail
Tuesday and the first deliveries of mail bearing it began today.
   Barbara Smoker, president of the National Secular Society, said
she was enraged by the slogan, which she condemned as insensitive
``propaganda.''
   Press reports quoted Ms. Smoker, 64, as saying that 26 percent
of Britain's 56 million population are atheists or agnostics and
that the society exists to defend their rights.
   Ms. Smoker was quoted as saying she plans to retaliate by
stamping her own slogan ``Jesus is a Myth'' on every envelope she
mails.
   Post Office spokesman Duncan Marshall said: ``The printing of
this slogan in no way confirms Post Office approval of its
contents. The slogan is not considered to be contentious but a fair
and reasonable message generally acceptable to the public.''
   The Post Office said Slennet, who belongs to an evangelical
group called Intercessors for Britain, paid $88,500 for the
privilege of having every letter mailed through 68 of Britain's 69
sorting offices stamped postmark ``Jesus is Alive!''
   The 69th office, in Plymouth, is already booked for a slogan
celebrating England's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.
   The deal includes mail sent abroad but excludes parcels,
periodicals and mail stamped by businesses that do their own
franking. Nearly 52 million letters are mailed daily in Britain.
   The Post Office said it considers each private application for a
postmark slogan on its merits. Revenue-boosting private-slogan
postmarks usually urge support for health-research charities and
other worthy causes. The postmark before the ``Jesus is Alive!''
slogan was a Post Office message reading ``Pass on your Postcode.''
   Cohen said the chief rabbi's office was ``flooded with phone
calls'' after news of the slogan appeared Tuesday.
   ``We recognize that this is a Christian country and we have the
utmost respect for the primacy for the church,'' Cohen told The
Associated Press. But he added: ``We do fear that the slogan ... is
by implication addressed to non-Christians and could well cause
offense and resentment.''
   Rabbi Charles Emmanuel, chairman of the Assembly of Rabbis of
the Reform Movement of Great Britain, told the AP: ``To me it is
simply a question of not only an infringement of my personal rights
but of my religious rights.''
   But the United Kingdom Islamic Mission, a group representing
Moslems, was quoted by the Guardian newspaper as saying of the
``Jesus is Alive!'' postmark: ``There is no problem for us.''

   Cocaine now is the most visible target in the
war on drugs, a battle that a congressional report says is costing
society tens of billions of dollars a year in lost wages, law
enforcement outlays and treatment programs.
   A study of recent changes in the drug trade by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said,
``Cocaine has emerged as the widely abused drug of greatest
concern.''
   Marijuana use has been declining, the report said, while various
substances known as designer drugs have emerged as a significant
phenomenon.
   Some highlights of ``Controlling Drug Abuse: A Status Report,''
include:
   _In 1983 alone, drugs cost American society some $59.7 billion
in crime, lost employment, criminal justice spending, prisons,
reduced productivity and treatment programs.
   _The number of cocaine-related emergencies reported by hospitals
jumped 167 percent from 1983 to 1986.
   _The share of high school seniors who admitted ever having used
cocaine fell from 16.9 percent in 1986 to 15.2 percent in 1987.
However, some experts fear this may not include all those using the
newly popular ``crack'' form of cocaine, which is smoked and is
highly popular among young people.
   _Heroin seems to be widely available across the country. The
number of heroin-related hospital emergencies rose 24 percent from
1983 to 1986.
   _Marijuana use has declined, although it remains the most widely
used illegal drug in the country. An estimated 61.9 million people
over age 12 have used this drug at least once.
   _Los Angeles is the cocaine consumption capital of the nation,
although PCP and heroin are also popular and it's a transshipment
point for Mexican heroin.
   _Miami is the cocaine importation center, with many homicides
related to the drug trade. The spread of the disease AIDS is being
added to by the use of drug needles.
   _New York has become a center for the importation of heroin and
has the nation's largest heroin addict population with the spread
of AIDS also a major problem. The New York heroin trade is
dominated by Chinese immigrants.
   _San Francisco faces a major problem with LSD and
methamphetamines, with growing use of heroin and cocaine.
   _Cocaine availability has increased sharply in Washington, D.C.,
where PCP also is used heavily. A high per capita overdose rate is
reported in the nation's capital.
   _Chicago too is facing rising cocaine use.

<HEAD>Flamboyant Mayor of Hoboken, N.J., Dies Of Heart Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Thomas Vezzetti, the badly dressed
bootlegger's son who took to the streets with a bullhorn to win
elections and fight the gentrification of this Hudson River city,
died early today. He was 59.
   Vezzetti died of a heart attack at St. Mary Hospital shortly
after midnight, police said.
   Vezzetti, a lifelong bachelor, was said to have been angry
Tuesday night by the outcome of a special election in the 5th Ward.
A councilman who frequently criticized Vezzetti's policies won a
special election over a candidate supported by the mayor.
   Officials said that at about 11 p.m. Tuesday neighbors heard
Vezzetti fall in his apartment and they called for an ambulance.
   City Business Administrator Edwin Chius said City Council would
meet later today to choose a successor to head this city of 42,000.
   Before Vezzetti's election to public office, he had developed a
reputation as an eccentric, sometimes wearing mismatched shoes,
orange pants and a Hawaiian shirt. His face was often unshaven and
he sometimes carried his belongings in two paper bags.
   He also was a political gadfly, showing up at school board and
city council meetings, complaining about the waste of taxpayers'
money.
   He took a bullhorn in 1982 and walked up and down Washington
Street, the city's main artery, to announce he was challenging the
city council president in the next election.
   He won, and then used the tactic against Mayor Steve Cappiello
in 1985, hitting on the theme of stopping yuppies from sweeping the
working and middle class out of the city across the Hudson from
Manhattan.
   ``If you want to stay in Hoboken, vote for me,'' he often said.
   He forced Cappiello into a runoff, and the mayor questioned
Vezzetti's mental competence and wardrobe.
   ``Clothes do not make the man,'' Vezzetti said at a campaign
debate.
   And he beat the three-term mayor in a major upset. Supporters
literally carried him to City Hall.
   His longtime motto was ``It's not that I'm so good. It's just
that they're so bad.''
   Thomas Jefferson Vezzetti and his twin sister, Louise, were born
in 1928.
   He once described his father as a ``bootlegger'' who owned five
saloons. The mayor's mother was an heiress to a peanuts and dried
fruits fortune.
   ``That's where I get my campaign money from,'' Vezzetti once
told New Jersey Monthly.
   ``He was one of a kind,'' said Police Chief George Crimmins.
``It'll be a long time before he can be replaced.''

   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, daughter of the

   A photograph of an obviously pregnant Ms. Schlossberg, who
married artist-author Edwin Schlossberg in July 1986, appeared in
today's editions.
   The News did not say when the baby is due.
   Ms. Schlossberg, 30, was photographed Monday arriving at the
Equitable building in Manhattan to give a speech in place of her
uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who had been sidelined by a

   The baby would be the first grandchild for Jacqueline Kennedy

   A condominium association rejected
an attempt by a blind man to move in because of his disability, the
man says.
   ``I was offended, insulted and hurt,'' Larry Tomacek, 35, said
from his parents' home in nearby Delray Beach. ``I'm still trying
to understand this. I'm a responsible adult and generally a good
neighbor.
   ``If I was some scum off the street, I'd understand,'' said
Tomacek, adding that he is mobile.
   But the Kenwick ``B'' Condominium Association of Century Village
sent a letter to apartment owner Donald Finck saying members voted
unanimously to reject Tomacek ``because the applicant ...
unfortunately is blind.''
   ``His presence here would pose some very serious problems to all
the owners here,'' the letter said.
   Tomacek, who supports himself on Social Security and disability
benefits, suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease
that destroys the retina of the eye cell by cell.
   ``I was very distressed,'' Finck said. ``You can't do that. It's
discrimination. (Tomacek) is entitled to live wherever he wants.''
   Jim Green, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union
in Florida, and Harry McGee, regional manager for the State
Division of the Blind Services, agreed that the association's
letter indeed was discriminatory.
   Florida law prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of
physical impairment, Green said.
   Should charges be filed, a conviction on the second-degree
misdemeanor carries a maximum 60-day jail sentence and $500 fine.
   Condo association president David Cohen declined to comment on
the matter.
   Tomacek said he no longer wanted to rent the apartment.
   ``With neighbors like that, who would need enemies?'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Bands of teen-agers taunted police and
erected barricades in the capital's streets today as a 36-hour
nationwide general strike protesting parliamentary elections got
under way.
   Police and paramilitary troops patrolled the city's streets,
which were nearly empty of traffic, and guarded main intersections.
   Shops and businesses were shuttered and most bus, train and
ferry service was canceled. Government offices were closed because
authorities had declared today and Thursday, the day of the
elections, holidays.
   Major opposition parties called the strike in an attempt to
disrupt the balloting, which they are boycotting and claim will be
rife with fraud. Voters are to choose Bangladesh's fourth
Parliament in 17 years of independence.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad announced the elections in
December when he dissolved Parliament in an effort to end an
opposition campaign seeking his ouster that began Nov. 10.
   Ershad, a 58-year-old former army general, seized power in this
nation of 105 million people in a 1982 bloodless coup. He was
elected president in 1986 in balloting the opposition said was
rigged.
   Dhaka was generally calm this morning, but small groups of
youths briefly stoned police in some parts of the city during the
afternoon.
   Four people were reported admitted to Dhaka Medical College
Hospital suffering minor injuries from homemade bombs.
   Youths stopped a municipal garbage truck, smashed it with sticks
and clubs and set it ablaze. Downtown, protesters threw up
barricades of broken bricks, which riot police later removed.
   On a street across from police headquarters, a police van was
briefly stoned, but there was no confrontation between attackers
and police.
   Near the city's main bus station, a band of about 70 youths
marched through the streets chanting ``strike, strike.''
   Police in riot helmets watched from trucks. The government also
called in 9,000 soldiers to guard against election-day violence.
   The mainstream opposition of 21 parties is boycotting the
balloting, but between eight and 102 political parties are vying
for Parliament's 300 seats.
   The two main opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina of the Awami
League and Khaleda Zia, warned that Thursday's vote would trigger
more bloodshed.
   Pre-election violence has claimed at least eight lives,
including that of a candidate who was gunned down by suspected
anti-government protesters.
   During Feb. 10 local elections, more than 100 people were
killed, by government count. The unofficial estimate is as high as
500.
   Since the campaign seeking Ershad's ouster began, at least 25
people have been killed in police clashes with mobs.

   A moderate earthquake hit the south flank
of Kilauea but was unrelated to the volcano's continuing eruption
that began five years ago, scientists said.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage from Tuesday night's
quake, according to police.
   The temblor measured 4.5 on the Richter scale, said Paul
Delaney, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory,
   The earthquake, which struck at 10:42 p.m. (3:42 a.m. EST
today), was centered six miles below the surface of the volcano to
the southwest of where lava has been pouring from the Earth since
the summer of 1986, Delaney said.
   The quake was not strong enough to generate a Pacific-wide
tsunami, or tidal wave, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Center in Honolulu.
   ``It didn't even rattle the china,'' Delaney said.
   The volcano on Hawaii Island began erupting Jan. 3, 1983,
although some early phases were marked by the underground movement
of lava.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

<HEAD>Vietnam Said To Urge Larger American Involvement In Southeast Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has begun urging the United States to
play a larger role in Southeast Asia and to work for a settlement
of the conflict in Cambodia, four U.S. scholars said after
returning from two weeks in Vietnam.
   Three said the push indicated that Vietnam was changing and
wanted to improve relations with the United States.
   The fourth said Vietnam was just putting into practice the old
Chinese proverb: ``Using barbarians to control barbarians.''
   The four China specialists spoke at a briefing Tuesday sponsored
by the Henry Luce Foundation, which supported their trip from Dec.
29 to Jan. 11.
   In all, seven American ``China hands'' took part in the trip,
which included stays in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, once known as
Saigon, and talks with high-ranking Vietnamese officials.
   Helen Chauncey, a professor of history at Georgetown University,
said America's preoccupation with its loss of the Vietnam War and
with the POW-MIA issue was hampering its ability to respond to a
changing Vietnam.
   ``We have to stop letting the past determine our actions in the
region,'' agreed Brantly Womack, a professor of political science
at Northern Illinois University.
   Jonathan Pollack, of the Rand Corporation, was not as optimistic
about the changes in Vietnam or about the prospects for peace in
Indochina.
   Pollack contended that the fighting in Cambodia was still a
``sideshow'' in a larger struggle between the Soviet Union and its
ally Vietnam against China. It will remain the scene of violence
until the larger powers can sort out their problems, he said.
   Frederic Wakeman Jr., a history professor at the University of
California, Berkeley, said he was impressed by changing Vietnamese
society, citing Beatles songs played on a flight from Hanoi and the
raffish tilt of berets on the heads of Communist Party officials.
   ``We were astonished again and again by the candor of the
Vietnamese,'' Wakeman said. ``Intellectuals, officials, party
members were all very open.''
   As a China scholar, Wakeman said, he was particularly interested
in the entrepreneurial spirit of the ethnic Chinese in Ho Chi Minh
City.
   ``We had the sense in Saigon of a commercial economy waiting to
break loose,'' he said.
   Chauncey and Womack said a combination of circumstances has
given America a chance for a new beginning in Vietnam.
   For the first time, Womack said, Vietnamese officials, including
Foreign Minister and Vice Premier Nguyen Co Thach, are talking with
eagerness about leaving Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, kicked out the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge and installed a puppet government in
Phnom Penh.
   About 140,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia fighting a
resistance coalition headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk that is
backed by China, the United States and the free-market countries of
Southeast Asia.
   But last year, Sihanouk split with the coalition and began
direct negotiations with Hun Sen, prime minister of the
Vietnamese-backed government.
   Chauncey said the negotiations, supported by Vietnam, were a
sign that Vietnam wants to end the conflict.
   ``Vietnamese officials told me they want the United States to
play an active role in negotiations to bring peace to Cambodia,''
she said.
   Vietnam also is trying to boost its economy, in which the
average annual income is about $125. As such, it has recognized the
need for foreign exchange and investment from the West.
   Wakeman said he believed Vietnam wants an increased U.S.
presence to counterbalance Chinese interests in Southeast Asia.
   ``In part, it's a very old diplomatic tactic of using the
barbarians to control the barbarians,'' he said.
   Chauncey said the United States must reassert itself in
Southeast Asia.
   ``If it doesn't, we will be left behind in what will be a
realignment of political and economic forces,'' she said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Coast members of the Writers Guild of
America almost certainly voted to authorize a strike against movie
and television producers, a former guild president said.
   The vote was taken Tuesday night in Hollywood by secret ballot,
and results were not expected to be announced until Thursday. The
9,000-member union also includes 2,500 East Coast members who were
scheduled to vote this afternoon.
   The guild's contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
   Union negotiators said a replacement contract offered by the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers was calculated
to force a strike. The negotiators unanimously urged members to
reject the offer and vote instead for a strike authorization, said
Cheryl Rhoden, a guild spokeswoman.
   She said 2,400 ballots were cast Tuesday night.
   The former guild president, Mel Shavelson, said that judging
from the sentiments he heard expressed during the balloting, ``I
don't think there was any doubt as to what the vote was.''
   While a strike could begin as early as Thursday, Shavelson said
it was unlikely a walkout would be called immediately.
   A strike could have an immediate impact on talk shows and soap
operas, which use scripts daily and without much lead time.
Prime-time programs and feature films would be affected only by a
longer strike.
   Negotiators for the two sides met for just two hours before
quitting Tuesday afternoon.
   The brief meeting followed a 21-hour session that lasted until
7:15 a.m. Tuesday and made progress on ``25 to 30 lesser issues,''
said Herb Steinberg, spokesman for the producers.
   Steinberg and Ms. Rhoden said three major stumbling blocks
remained. The writers are seeking more ``creative rights'' to
control what happens to their scripts and higher payments when
programs are distributed in foreign markets. The producers want to
give writers reduced payments for domestic syndication of one-hour
television programs, a shrinking market.
   The entertainment writers last went on strike three years ago.
The walkout lasted two weeks before writers voted to accept a
package offering them essentially the same terms as one they had
earlier rejected.
   The median annual income for guild writers is $40,000, but about
half of the members are unemployed at any given time, the union
says.

   Five thousand troops from half the NATO
countries were airlifted to the mountains and valleys of northern
Norway in a show of unity as leaders of the alliance gathered in
Brussels at a major strategy conference.
   U.S. transport planes on Tuesday ferried in the combat units for
the maneuvers, code-named ``Arrowhead Express,'' which climaxes in
two weeks in a battle on snow-covered terrain against an ``enemy''
of 9,500 Norwegian forces.
   The exercise mobilized the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, a
brigade designed to rush to areas of potential conflict with the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   The maneuvers were clearly intended to serve political more than
military aims, and to demonstrate the cohesion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``Our operational role is in peacetime, to show as many flags
with as much visibility as possible in a threatened area to deter
an aggressor,'' said British Maj. Don McLaren.
   ``If we reach the combat stage, we've failed,'' he said in a
telephone interview Tuesday from command headquarters in Bardufoss,
1,000 miles north of Oslo.
   Although not officially tied to the summit, the exercise
dovetails with President Reagan's recent efforts to reassure U.S.
allies of the American commitment to defend Europe at the same time
that it negotiates arms reductions with the Soviet Union.
   The war games also coincide with mounting Norwegian concern that
NATO's flank in the north Atlantic will become more active
following the U.S.-Soviet agreement to dismantle intermediate-range
nuclear weapons.
   ``The INF agreement has made the Norwegian and the Barents Seas
more important,'' Kaare Willoch, chairman of the Norwegian
parliament's foreign affairs committee, said Tuesday.
   The Soviet Union has built the world's greatest concentration of
firepower on the Kola Peninsula adjacent to Norway's northern
border.
   Willoch, a former conservative prime minister, said in an
interview that the Soviet buildup in the north had been going on
for decades and had shown no signs of slackening since the
disarmament accord was signed in December.
   ``The buildup proceeds. It necessitates NATO countermeasures,''
while negotiations continue on further arms reduction accords, he
said.
   The Soviet Northern Fleet, armed with submarine-launched,
long-range nuclear weapons, must pass Norway to reach the Atlantic
fire zone, the closest point of deployment to the United States for
Soviet missiles.
   Norway's northwestern coast, kept ice-free all year by the
warmth of the Gulf Stream, also becomes more attractive to the
Soviets as naval warfare grows in importance in Soviet military
strategy, Norwegian analysts say.
   One war scenario foresees the Soviets slicing off Norway's
remote and nearly unpopulated northern province, challenging NATO's
willingness to respond. That is precisely the kind of action the
Allied Command Europe Mobile Force was formed in 1960 to deter,
McLaren said.
   Arrowhead Express, commanded by Norwegian Vice Admiral Torolf
Rein, involves forces from eight of NATO's 16 countries: the United
States, Canada, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Britain and Norway.
   The U.S. role in Arrowhead Express is limited to air support,
since its units are not trained for arctic warfare. Much of the
maneuvering will be done on skis or snowmobiles, McLaren said.
   The force holds maneuvers twice a year, once in Norway or
Denmark and once along an isolated region of NATO's southern flank
in Turkey, Greece or Italy.

   Neighbors and police worked frantically
but failed to save an elderly man who was buried alive by cinder
blocks when he tried to demolish a 5-foot-high wall in his yard.
   Edward Margrabia, 69, died Tuesday of multiple trauma at
Pembroke Pines Hospital.

   Chris McCauley, whose home is behind Margrabia's, said she heard
the wall collapse as she fixed sandwiches for lunch.
   ``I just heard a sound like cement blocks hitting the ground ...
I thought it was strange to hear a noise and see nobody there,''
she said. When she realized what had happened, she roused other
neighbors to help extricate Margrabia.
   ``By the time we had eight people there, we were trying to pry
the wall up with pieces of wood. And as we were trying, the wall
broke _ right on his back,'' Ms. McCauley said.
   When police arrived to free Margrabia with a hydraulic jack, he
was unconscious, police spokesman Ed Plaisted said. Margrabia, who
was recovering from heart-bypass surgery, was trapped for about 30
minutes.

<HEAD>Two Polish Journalists Sentenced To Prison For Spying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court sentenced two Polish
journalists to prison after convicting them of selling information
to Western intelligence agencies, a government spokesman said.
   Mariusz Dastych, 46, and Tadeusz Podwysocki, 56, both formerly
worked for the official government daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita
and were arrested last April on spying charges. Both reported on
Poland's economy.
   A Warsaw military court on Monday sentenced Dastych to eight
years in prison after finding him guilty of selling information
since 1973 to the CIA on Poland's ``socio-political situation,''
government spokesman Jerzy Urban said. The court also fined Dastych
$790 and ordered the confiscation of all his property, said Urban,
speaking at his weekly news conference Tuesday.
   Podwysocki received a 1{-year prison sentence because the court
accepted his defense that he was ``unaware that information he had
communicated was used for intelligence purposes,'' Urban said.
   Podwysocki, one of Poland's best-known economic reporters, also
was barred from working as a journalist for two years, fined $530
and ordered to pay back all the Western currency he had received
for the information. Urban did not specify how much the journalists
received for selling the information.
   Urban said Dastych and Podwysocki had cooperated with
``representatives of another Western intelligence service,'' which
he would not name.
   He refused to confirm or deny reports that the second country
involved was Japan. According to Western press reports, they were
accused of passing trade secrets to Japan.

   Three boys held a gun to the head of
a 9-year-old to rob her of the dollar bill her grandmother had
given her to buy an ice cream cone, police and the child said.
   A 10-year-old boy pressed the gun to Latarra William's temple
and told her, ``Put it down, put it down now or I'll blow you head
off,'' the girl said Tuesday, a day after the robbery.
   The 10-year-old and his two 12-year-old companions were
apprehended Tuesday and were carrying 12 rocks of crack cocaine, $4
and a starter's pistol, which doesn't fire bullets, said police
spokeswoman Connie Ryan.
   The boys were held overnight in the Broward County Juvenile
Detention Center, each charged with armed robbery and possession of
cocaine, she said.
   After the robbery, the girl ran home to her grandmother, who
called the police.

<HEAD>Storms Thunder Across Southern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms rumbled across the southern Plains,
unleashing tornadoes, hail as big as baseballs and heavy rain.
   In Texas, two tornadoes touched down near Wichita Falls Tuesday,
along with hail up to 1} inches in diameter, but no injuries or
damage were reported. Baseball-size hail fell at Lake Kickapoo, and
winds gusted to 62 mph at Lake Kemp. More than 3{ inches of rain
fell in six hours in Wichita Falls.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell in southern and eastern Oklahoma.
   A tornado touched down briefly near Orosia, Calif., southeast of
Fresno, but no injuries or damage were reported.
   In Southern California, rain showers were scattered late Tuesday
from the valleys to the coast. Up to 4 inches of snow and winds up
to 35 mph were expected across the area through Thursday morning.
   In Denver, rain changed to snow late Tuesday as a cold front
swept across the central Rockies and central Plains. Snow
advisories were posted for Colorado's Front Range and Wyoming's
southern mountains. One to 4 inches of snow was expected in Denver,
with up to 8 inches possible in the foothills of the Colorado
Rockies. In southeast Wyoming, up to 3 inches of snow could fall by
this afternoon, with up to 6 inches possible in the mountains.
   Snow showers also fell across sections of Michigan, but much of
it was light and there was little accumulation. Freezing rain
caused slippery roads in parts of Lower Michigan.
   Today's forecast called for numerous showers and thunderstorms
across much of Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and the lower and middle
Mississippi Valley, with possibly severe thunderstorms in central
and eastern Texas, extreme southeast Oklahoma, southwest Arkansas
and western Louisiana; rain from Missouri across the Ohio Valley
and in western Pennsylvania; rain or snow showers in Michigan and
northern Illinois; rain changing to snow in northeast Kansas; snow
showers from eastern Colorado across Wyoming to western South
Dakota; showers and a few thunderstorms, with snow in higher
elevations, in western Colorao, Utah and northern Arizona and rain
on the Northwest coast.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s from
the south Atlantic Coast states to the Gulf Coast, Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys and Texas, with a few 80s in southern
Texas; the 60s along the Mexican border of New Mexico and Arizona
and in much of California; the 20s or 30s in northern New England
and parts of New York state and from Michigan to the upper
Mississippi Valley and the High Plains; and in the 40s and 50s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at Massena, N.Y., to 69 degrees at Brownsville,
Texas.

   The U.S. dollar was mixed against major foreign
currencies in Europe early today. Gold bullion rose.
   Traders in Italy and West Germany said there was very little
activity in exchange markets, continuing a trend of the past few
days.
   The dollar fluctuated within a narrow range during the first
hours of trading and was expected to hold steady throughout the
European session in the absence of any market-related news.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:

<HEAD>Danforth: DOE TO Halt TMI Train Until Study Complete</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear waste shipments from the crippled
Three Mile Island plant will be temporarily halted while the
Department of Energy completes its investigation into a rail
switching incident in the St. Louis area, according to Sen. John
Danforth.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., has introduced legislation
that would require casks used by the DOE to ship radioactive waste
to meet safety standards set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Danforth, R-Mo., said Tuesday the DOE has agreed to stop the
shipments from Pennsylvania to a laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho,
until the investigation is completed. He said he didn't know how
long the probe would take to complete.
   Danforth, ranking minority member of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, last week requested the
investigation into whether there were violations of rail
regulations Feb. 9 when a mislabeled car was added to a Conrail
train carrying casks of radioactive wastes.
   The covered hopper car carried a placard stating it contained a
flammable material, Federal Railroad Administration spokesman Bill
Loftus said last week. It was later discovered the car was not
carrying the dangerous cargo.
   Loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violations
by the rail switching yard and the Union Pacific Railroad, which
operated the train after it left the yard, and a lime company that
was shipping the car.
   Danforth said Tuesday the DOE had agreed to allow the Department
of Transportation to make a complete study of the routes used to
transport the TMI material. The Energy Department has done such
studies in the past but has always concluded that the route from
Pennsylvania to Idaho was the best.
   A request by Danforth not to move rail shipments in the St.
Louis area between the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. _ commuter rush hours _ also was agreed to by
the DOE.
   Other agreements by the DOE included a promise not to add cars
to TMI trains along the route. The trains, which leave Pennsylvania
under Conrail power, will continue to switch to Union Pacific when
necessary but no cars will be added, Danforth said.
   As a way to minimize the total number of shipments, all future
shipments will be consolidated into three casks, Danforth said.
   According to a statement by Danforth's office, other agreements
made by the DOE include:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ Union Pacific will assign a certified hazardous materials
inspector at the East St. Louis, Ill., yard to assist with
mechanical inspections and managers will be assigned at crew change
points, inspection points and en route to monitor speed and times
of day schedules through St. Louis.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ The DOE will post a health physicist on each TMI train.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ An FRA official will accompany each TMI train to monitor
speed, schedules and track and equipment. The Energy Department
also will provide additional emergency response training to St.
Louis and state officials.
   Buechner's legislation, introduced Monday, would remove an
exemption that allows the DOE to make nuclear waste shipments
without NRC safety inspections.
   The energy department has contended that casks it uses to ship
radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels, including the TMI
shipments, will withstand even the most extraordinary transportion
accident.

<HEAD>Two Arrested Aboard Plane On Drug Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jetliner returned to Kennedy Airport after a
passenger was found in a lavatory with crack and equipment to burn
it for ``freebasing,'' authorities said.
   The man and a companion who was standing outside were arrested
Tuesday by federal agents who happened to be aboard, said Robert
Stutman, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York
office.
   A flight attendant who smelled ether discovered the man in the
lavatory, along with about a quarter-ounce of crack, a torch, ether
and butane, Stutman said. The man outside also had crack in his
possession, he said.
   ``This could have produced a real tragedy,'' Stutman said.
``Ether is an extremely volatile, explosive substance when it is
near flames.''
   Richard Moskowitz and Jeff Tofler were arrested on charges that
included possession of cocaine and interference with a flight,
Stutman said. They were turned over to the FBI upon landing, he
said.
   About 98 passengers were aboard Eastern Airlines Flight 977,
which left Kennedy at 1:35 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in
Miami at 4:24 p.m., said Karen Ceremsak, an airline spokeswoman.
   When the pilot learned about the alleged drug activity, he
notified a DEA agent and a U.S. Customs agent who were on board to
attend a trial in Miami, Stutman said.
   The ages and hometowns of the suspects were not immediately
known.
   A powdered form of cocaine, not crack, a potent derivative, is
usually used in freebasing, a process in which the powder is mixed
with ether and then heated so the fumes can be inhaled, Stutman
said.
   He said there was no damage to the aircraft.

<HEAD>Soldier Kills Seven Sleeping Comrades Before Being Shot Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sri Lankan soldier opened fire with
a semi-automatic rifle and killed seven sleeping comrades before he
was shot to death by his commander, military officials said today.
   Nine other soldiers were wounded in the Tuesday night attack at
an army camp next to a steel mill 10 miles southeast of Colombo,
they said.
   The attacker was a member of the People's Liberation Front, an
ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group that has raided several military
camps to steal weapons, the officials said.
   The officials, who by regulation cannot be identified, said the
attack was designed to kill as many soldiers as possible and to
steal weapons. They said all the victims were Sinhalese, the
majority ethnic group that controls the government and military in
Sri Lanka.
   The officials were unable to explain why the assailant risked
making so much noise by gunning down fellow soldiers if the purpose
of the attack was to collect weapons and escape.
   A vehicle had arrived at the scene to enable the attacker to
make his getaway, they said, but the escape was foiled when the
commanding officer heard the shooting, rushed to the scene and
killed the soldier.
   The driver escaped in the vehicle, the officials said.
   Neither the soldier nor his commander was identified, but the
officials said they both served in a signal corps unit.
   According to the officials, similar attacks have occurred in the
past but this was the largest number of soldiers ever killed by a
fellow soldier.
   The government has blamed the People's Liberation Front for the
assassinations of at least 150 government officials and supporters
since July 29, when Sri Lanka signed a peace accord designed to end
a 4-year-old separatist war by Tamil guerrillas.
   The front says the accord makes too many concessions to the
minority Tamils and has vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact.
   Military officials said last winter that front had about 4,000
supporters in the 45,000-man army.
   India mediated the peace accord last summer and it now has
45,000 peackeeping troops in the island.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, want a separate homeland, claiming they
are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese Buddhists.

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts have started conducting tests
to determine how to repair the Sphinx, the ancient monument that
lost a chunk of stone from its right shoulder.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx Feb. 7, six days after a
sandstorm buffeted Giza Plateau.
   Damage to the Sphinx caused heated political and scientific
debate over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and Egypt's
other ancient treasures.
   The main casualty of the unrest was Ahmed Kadry, until early
February chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni, of staging the rock fall to reflect badly on Kadry's
stewardship of the Sphinx and, by extension, the other relics of
Egypt's rich past.
   Restoration work began on the Sphinx on Monday.
   The monument was fitted with sandbags for support and
scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort.
   A committee of experts took rock samples to test for salt
content and damage and to see whether the stone is strong enough to
hold iron bars that will be inserted to strengthen it.
   Tests also are being conducted to determine what kind of mortar
should be used to cement the rock in place.
   ``We're not in a hurry. We want to do things right,'' said Zahi
Hawass, general director of the pyramids area and director of the
restoration.
   The Sphinx has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching
lion. Many Egyptologists think the face belonged to Chephren, son
of Cheops and builder of the second pyramid on Giza Plateau next to
Cheops' Great Pyramid.
   Any damage to the pyramids or the Sphinx _ symbols of the past
with deep emotional overtones for modern Egyptians _ brings instant
outcries in Cairo's national press. The rock fall proved no
exception, to Kadry's chagrin, and charges of incompetence and
corruption flooded the newspapers.

   Vietnam today repatriated what it
believes are the remains of 17 American servicemen listed as
missing in action from the Vietnam war, a U.S. military official
said.
   The Vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other
missing Americans, said Lt. Col. Paul Mather, head of the U.S.
military team that flew to Hanoi to receive the remains.
   The remains were flown to the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Honolulu for analysis after a brief turnover ceremony
at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport.
   The repatriation was the fourth largest since the war ended in
April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South
Vietnam government. The largest was in August 1985, involving 26
sets of remains.
   Earlier reports that 20 remains were to be returned today
resulted from a misunderstanding in communications from Hanoi, said
Mather, the head of the Bangkok office of the U.S. Joint Casualty
Resolution Center.
   The center, based in Hawaii, is entrusted with resolving the
fates of nearly 1,800 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA.
   Mather said some of the 17 remains and three cases on which
written reports were received were on a list of 70 high priority
cases that U.S. presidential envoy and retired Gen. John W. Vessey
Jr. gave the Vietnamese during his mission to Hanoi last August.
   The United States says that in these so-called ``discrepancy
cases,'' there is strong evidence the Vietnamese know what happened
to the missing men, including photographs of them taken after their
capture.
   Mather said each set of remains was accompanied by a written
report containing such information as the area where the remains
were found, and what people there said about them. He said the
Vietnamese also turned over identification cards and ``dog tags'' _
military identification tags which servicemen wear around their
necks.
   Mather said the remains were placed in metal transfer cases and
loaded onto a C-141 transport plane for the flight to Honolulu. A
U.S. honor guard saluted as each case, draped with a folded U.S.
flag, was loaded during the half-hour ceremony, he said.
   A high proportion of remains returned by Vietnam after a
preliminary analysis are later confirmed by the U.S. Army
laboratory as those of MIAs.
   Mather also announced that the Vietnamese have set March 12 as
the starting date for the next round of ``technical talks'' on MIAs.
   During these talks, which Hanoi has agreed to hold six times
annually, experts on both sides discuss ways of retrieving remains,
locating warplane crash sites and related issues.
   Today's turnover was the third since Hanoi agreed during
Vessey's visit to break a long deadlock and resume efforts to
account for the missing men.
   The United States pledged then to look into Vietnam's own
humanitarian concerns, and an official U.S. medical team flew into
Hanoi today to continue that mission, said the spokesman of the
U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Ross Petzing.
   It was the fourth visit by a U.S. medical team. The teams have
been studying the plight of disabled war veterans and other
humanitarian cases and made recommendations on how private U.S.
charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation programs.
   Petzing said the team included Dr. Bruce Van Dam, an orthopedic
surgeon at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.;
Frederick Downs, the director of the Prosthetics and Sensory Aids
Service of the Veterans Administration; and Laurence Kerr, the
State Department's desk officer for Vietnam.
   The Vietnamese have said they prefer direct U.S. government aid,
but Washington has refused because of its embargo on aid to protest
Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.

   A millionaire stock trader charged
with intending to shoot financier Ivan Boesky has been ordered held
without bail by a judge who rejected arguments that jail would harm
the trader's mental health.
   John A. Mulheren, 38, of Rumson appeared Tuesday before U.S.
Magistrate John C. Manna to face two charges of attempting to
tamper with a federal witness. He was transferred to a federal
prison in New York City.
   The magistrate scheduled a Friday bail hearing over the
objections of Mulheren's attorney, Peter Bennett, who said his
client suffered manic-depression.
   ``A manic-depressive such as my client back on lithium for the
last five days is not a risk to himself or others,'' Bennett told
the judge. ``Jail is detrimental to his condition. He's far better
off in a private care clinic.''
   Bennett said Mulheren was on a ``manic-crash'' the day
authorities allege he intended to shoot Boesky.
   Authorities contend Mulheren pulled out of his riverfront estate
Feb. 18 with a high-powered assault rifle and Army fatigues in the
back seat of his car after police had confiscated three other
weapons from him.
   He intended to shoot Boesky, 50, of New York and Boesky's former
chief stock trader, Michael Davidoff, 43, of Manalapan Township,
according to a New Jersey complaint.
   Before the federal hearing Tuesday, state Superior Court Judge
Alvin Y. Milberg released Mulheren from the county jail where he
was being held on the state charges.
   Mulheren was arrested immediately afterward by four U.S.
marshals, flanked by an investigator from the U.S. attorney's
office in the southern district of New York and a federal attorney
from New Jersey, authorities said.
   Mulheren had been held in the county jail in lieu of $17,500
bail on two weapons charges that carry a total maximum of 15 years
in prison.
   Bennett told the magistrate that Mulheren was not bailed out of
the county jail for 12 days because his manic-depressive condition
precluded him from cooperating with attorneys on a defense. Bennett
asked that bail be set at Tuesday's hearing.
   However, Manna ruled in favor of Terrence Flynn, an assistant
U.S. attorney who said he needed more time to prepare his case.
   Boesky, once a close friend of Mulheren's, and Davidoff pleaded
guilty last year to a single count of securities fraud and have
cooperated with the government's continuing investigation of
insider trading on Wall Street.
   Boesky paid a fine of $100 million to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to settle civil charges of insider trading, and
will begin serving a three-year prison term March 24. Davidoff
faces a five-year term when sentenced.
   Mulheren is a friend of rock star Bruce Springsteen. The singer,
also of Rumson, visited Mulheren in the county jail Saturday during
a break in his national concert tour, Monmouth County Sheriff
William M. Lanzaro confirmed Monday.

   President Reagan and 15 other allied
leaders today began their first summit talks since 1982 in a bid to
underscore the unity of the Western alliance despite differences
over nuclear arms strategy.
   Reagan, the last of the leaders to arrive at sprawling NATO
headquarters, made no comment as he passed a crowd of reporters and
diplomats for the first summit session, but NATO Secretary General
Lord Carrington stressed the cohesion of the alliance.
   Carrington said the summit will provide NATO ``with sustained
impetus...in a way which will reflect the fundamental solidarity
which unites us in trans-Atlantic partnership.''
   Looking toward Soviet-American arms talks, Carrington said an
improved Soviet human rights record was fundamental to creating
``the confidence necessary to proceed with a radical arms control
agenda.''
   He added: ``For most of us in the West that cause (of tension)
is the degree of mistrust created by the denial of basic human
rights and freedom to the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.''
   Carrington reaffirmed NATO's commitment supporting a proposed
superpower agreement to reduce long-range nuclear weaponry by 50
percent on both sides. He said NATO also looked forward to ``a more
serious engagement'' with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on a chemical
weapons ban and reducing the Eastern bloc's superiority in
conventional arms.
   Central to the summit talks here was the issue of how to fill
the gap left by Reagan's agreeement with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev last December to eliminate ground-launched medium-range
nuclear missiles from Europe.
   While the allies agreed on the need to reduce East-West
conventional forces, a dispute remained over whether NATO members
should quickly improve their stocks of short-range nuclear missiles.
   ``I don't look for any glossing over at all,'' said Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as he arrived for the talks.
   As the meeting began, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
reported that ``progress is fine'' on drafting a statement of
common alliance goals to be issued at the conclusion of the two-day
summit.
   Reagan, who reached Brussels coughing and complaining of
allergies, ws to spend 2 1-2 hours conferring with the 15 other
heads of state or government. When he arrived Tuesday, the
president tried to allay concerns over the Warsaw Pact's advantage
in conventional forces by promising to keep U.S. troops in Europe
``as long as Europeans want them to stay.''
   Before the summit talks began over lunch, Reagan met privately
with Secretary of State George Shultz on the secretary's recent
efforts to get the peace process moving in the Middle East.
   Fitzwater told reporters that Shultz has been doing ``yeoman's
work'' and that United States has made clear it wants a more
visible role in the Middle East peace process.
   Although Fitzwater said no decision had been made, he and other
officials indicated Reagan is likely to send Shultz back to the
Middle East after the summit.
   In his afternoon remarks to NATO _ a session closed to reporters
in the alliance's austere central meeting hall _ the president was
to repeat his assurances of the U.S. commitment to the NATO
democracies and urge them to repel Soviet attempts to split the
pact.
   The heads of state and government will discuss ``overall policy
and the direction of the alliance _ the big picture,'' Fitzwater
added.
   Fitzwater said Reagan also planned to listen to his colleagues'
concerns, particularly about the new round of arms control talks
and their worries that American budget restrictions might force
cutbacks in the 326,000 U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe.
   ``We also expect them to voice support ... as the president
prepares for the Moscow summit,'' Fitzwater said. A date hasn't
been set, but the fourth meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is expected to be held in late May or June.
   The spokesman said that while the nuts and bolts on issues such
as troop strength would be left to lower-level aides, Reagan would
urge the members to push forward on talks with the East bloc on
reducing its edge in conventional forces.
   Now in a preliminary stage in Vienna, the discussions over
conventional force reductions are expected to begin in earnest this
fall.
   Planners on both sides of the Atlantic have predicted that no
major decisions will result from the NATO summit. The leaders are
expected to sidestep differences over such issues as modernizing
their own short-range nuclear weapons arsenal, and concentrate
instead on issuing final statements that emphasize the pact's
cohesion and resolve.

   Michael Caine has just made his eighth film in
three years and has a TV miniseries set to roll, but the
Oscar-winning star of ``Sherlock and Me'' says he still worries
about being out of work.
   ``You feel uneasy if you haven't got something to do,'' Caine
said in an interview in North London's Camden Town, where the $8.5
million-movie was concluding its nine-week shoot.
   ``People say I work all the time, but I don't. What they
(distributors) do is always put the bloody things out at the same
time.''
   The actor's on-screen good cheer has been one of the few
constants in the ever-changing Hollywood scene.
   Last year, he played Sally Field's love interest in
``Surrender'' and a British intelligence agent in ``The Fourth
Protocol.'' He starred in films as quintessentially American as
``Jaws IV _ The Revenge,'' and as quintessentially English as ``The
Whistle Blower,'' a political thriller.
   In 1986 he was a British diplomat romantically linked with call
girl Sigourney Weaver in ``Half Moon Street,'' and had vivid
supporting roles in ``Sweet Liberty'' and ``Mona Lisa.''
   Then, too, there was his Academy Award last year for best
supporting actor for his performance in ``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
The erstwhile Cockney, who was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in
1933, the son of a porter at Billingsgate fish market in London,
had integrated himself into the bittersweet world of Woody Allen's
Manhattan neurotics.
   ``I'd known Woody for years, and I knew New York so well,'' said
Caine. ``I don't have a voice which is posh British, anyway.
   ``My attitude is that I'm more like an American, coming from a
working-class background. Lots of Americans think I'm Australian,
or something like that _ Crocodile Dundee's father.''
   Caine's previous Oscar nominations were for ``Alfie'' in 1966,
``Sleuth'' in 1972 and ``Educating Rita'' in 1983.
   In his new film, he impersonates that celebrated sleuth,
Sherlock Holmes. Caine is a boozing, down-on-his-luck actor who is
hired by Dr. Watson to play the famed fictional detective to prove
him real.
   ``I get to play two parts and a particular hero of mine, which I
like, because I've always been a great fan of Holmes,'' he said.
   ``We have the pipe, the magnifying glass, everything,'' said
Caine, referring to the traditional Holmes accoutrements. ``It's a
chance to play a hero who I'm not really right for and to do it in
an entirely different way, as a comedy.''
   The film, due out in the fall from Orion Pictures, co-stars
Oscar winner Ben Kingsley (``Gandhi'') as Dr. Watson, who is forced
by public demand to find a real-life Holmes to match the figure he
has been writing about in a magazine.
   Caine compared his creation to the part of the inimitable
Inspector Clouseau,, created by the late Peter Sellers in the
popular Pink Panther series. ``Peter would have laughed at some of
the physical humor I do. The character is such a putz,'' Caine
said. ``I'm having fun; I'll tell you that.''
   On March 14, Caine moves on to his next assignment: a CBS
miniseries, ``Jack the Ripper,'' which marks his first TV work
since he played Horatio to Christopher Plummer's Hamlet in a 1966
production of Shakespeare's tragedy.
   Caine will play the fictitious Inspector Frederick Abberline of
Scotland Yard in the $5 million show.
   Said to be based on confidential police and government files,
the show will be aired in the autumn to coincide with the 100th
anniversary of the notorious mass murderer, who terrorized
Victorian London in the late 1880s.
   Caine said he's made a conscious effort to vary his parts and
his performances. ``It gives you cachet as someone who can play
anything,'' he said.
   ``I've been a leading actor, not a movie star who comes on and
does the Michael Caine personality performance like a Cary Grant or
a John Wayne, although I admire both of them very much.''
   His salary, he joked, reflected this attitude: ``I know a lot of
actors like Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, who don't do pictures
for years, but they get $6 million, $7 million, $15 million a
picture.''
   ``I don't. I get $1.98 and a bollocking (a reprimand) for being
late on Monday morning,'' he joked. Caine is one of the few British
actors who reportedly commands around $1 million a movie.
   Caine said the British had reacted oddly to his decision in June
1986 to return to his native country with his wife, the Indian
model Shakira Baksh, and their 14-year-old daughter, Natasha, after
living for nine years in Los Angeles.
   ``People here treat me as if I'd just come back from some
fearsome jungle and survived,'' he said. ``Americans are just like
we are, except they work harder _ that's what frightens the
British. You've got to get up at 8 o'clock Monday morning and go
out and do something; you can't just sit there.''
   Caine is glad to be home. He divides his time between an
apartment in London's elegant Knightsbridge and a 15th-century
manor house in rural Oxfordshire northwest of the capital city.
   As for the sometimes brutal English class system, Caine said
it's no problem.
   ``Years ago, all the people who wouldn't have spoken to me are
now people I wouldn't want to speak to because they're so boring,''
he said.
   ``I've gone beyond class. I go with anybody, from the queen
down.''

   Police were searching for suspects in the
cross burning near the home of a black couple in a racially
integrated neighborhood.
   ``It was done so quietly that we did not hear a thing,'' Mary
Lomax, 72, said Tuesday. ``Nothing like this has ever happened here
in our lifetime.''
   She said her 19-year-old granddaughter, who lives across the
street, spotted the cross burning Monday night in a lot next to the
home Mrs. Lomax shares with her husband. The cross stood 4{ feet by
6 feet.
   Police said Tuesday they had no witnesses.
   ``It is an out-of-the way neighborhood and it suggests something
local,'' said Sgt. Angus Park. ``We know of no incident that could
have triggered the cross burning.''
   Cross burning is a felony punishable by three years in jail and
a $5,000 fine. According to the Office of Human Rights, the last
cross burning in Howard County occurred in October 1984. Four
juveniles were arrested.

<HEAD>Government Attorney Charges Pilot Drug Abuse In Delta Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of the Delta airliner that
crashed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in 1985, killing
137 people, had a pattern of ``use and abuse'' of three
tranquilizers, a government lawyer said.
   Attorney Roy Krieger suggested during his opening statement at a
trial to determine liability for the crash that Delta Capt. Edward
M. Connors might have habitually piloted jetliners under the
influence of drugs.
   Krieger told U.S. District Judge David O. Belew Jr., who is
presiding over the non-jury trial, that prescription records will
show Connors took the tranquilizers Dalmane in 1978, Valium in 1982
and 1984 and Stelazine from 1982 to 1985.
   The records will show ``a clear pattern of use and abuse of
these tranquilizers'' over the eight years before the Aug. 2, 1985,
crash, Krieger said.
   ``The conclusion is inescapable,'' Krieger said. ``He must have
been taking them on the days he was flying'' because the
prescription quantities were too large to have been taken only when
he was off duty.
   ``Why should the day of the crash be any different than all the
other days in the previous years that he was taking
tranquilizers,'' Krieger said.
   Delta lawyer John Martin said during a break in the trial that
there is no evidence that Connors was using Stelazine at the time
of the crash. He said too little tissue was recovered from the
crash to run tests for drugs other than alcohol. Those tests were
negative.
   ``The medical experts will show (Stelazine) is a prescription
tranquilizer that would not affect a person's ability to fly
anyway,'' Martin said. ``There are pilots who fly taking
Stelazine.''
   During his opening statement, Martin said negligence on the part
of Federal Aviation Administration and National Weather Service
employees caused Delta Flight 191 to crash.
   ``The crew of 191 found themselves in the wrong place at the
wrong time'' because none of the government employees did their
jobs,'' he said.
   Martin claimed FAA controllers and the weather service failed to
warn the flight crew of the severity of weather at the airport.
   A report by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded
that the crash was caused, in part, by the pilot's decision to fly
the L-1011 widebody jet into a wind shear, a violent downdraft.
   The trial will determine whether the government must pay part of
$91.2 million in claims that Delta's insurers have paid so far in
the crash.
   In December, Belew ruled that about 90 lawsuits filed by
individuals against Delta should be parceled out from federal court
in Fort Worth to other federal courts. About half of those suits
have been settled.

<HEAD>Three Stooges' `Joe' Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY FARAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Besser, a rotund member of The Three
Stooges for two years, was found dead of an undetermined illness at
his home, his publicist said. He was 80.
   ``He had been ill for some time and wouldn't even see a
doctor,'' said publicist Jeff Lenburg. Besser's body was found
Tuesday by a relative, Lenburg said.
   ``I go back 50 years with Joe Besser when I played vaudeville
with him,'' said comedian Milton Berle. ``He was one of a kind. He
was very innovative, very creative. He was a darling of a man, very
congenial.''
   Besser joined Moe Howard and Larry Fine from 1956 to 1958 and
was one of several actors to replace Shemp Howard as the third
stooge.
   The Three Stooges specialized in head-knocking, eye-gouging
slapstick, pratfalls and endless buffoonery. The trio made more
than 190 short films and about 50 feature-length films until the
'60s, Lenburg said.
   Besser embraced his role, bouncing off his fellow stooges in a
schtick that distinguised his character.
   No matter how light the slap, Besser's invariable response was a
whining, ``Not so h-a-a-a-a-a-r-d.'' The stooges' preposterousness
elicited from Besser an exasperated, ``Ooooh, you crazy.''
   The original Three Stooges, created in the vaudeville days of
the 1920s, were Morris ``Moe'' Horowitz, who changed his last name
to Howard; his brother Samuel ``Shemp'' Horowitz and Larry
Fineberg, who used the stage name Fine.
   By the early 1930s, Shemp had left in a pay dispute and was
replaced by his brother, Jerome Howard, known as Curly. Curly left
the team in 1946 after suffering a stroke, and brother Shemp came
back to replace him. After Shemp's death in 1955, he was replaced
by Besser, who in turn was replaced in 1959 by Joe De Rita, who
played ``Curly Joe,'' when the trio began making feature films.
   Curly Howard died in 1952. Moe Howard and Fine died in 1975. De
Rita, the last surviving stooge, is 79 and retired, Lenburg said.
   The character of Joe became Besser's trademark and he added to
it in television's ``The Abbott and Costello Show,'' where he
played the mean, whining brat ``Stinky'' who liked to slap Lou
around.
   He appeared on ``The Abbott and Costello Show'' in the 1950s and
'60s, along with regular appearances on ``The Ken Murray Show'' and
``The Joey Bishop Show.''
   Besser made 250 television appearances during his 67-year
career, joking with such comics as Berle and Jerry Lewis. He also
appeared in more than 40 films.
   Before becoming a Stooge, Besser worked as a comedian on
Broadway, on radio and in motion pictures.
   In the 1940s, his portrayal of an exasperated, whining child
earned him a spot in Olsen and Johnson's long-running Broadway
show, ``Sons o' Fun,'' a sequel to their ``Hellzapoppin.''
   Besser called his association with the Stooges ``the happiest
years of my life in show business.'' He was on hand in 1983 when
The Three Stooges were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   Besser is survived by his wife of 56 years, Ernie. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Pinochet: Bombs at Airport Part Of Assassination Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet said a chain
of bombs found at the end of an airport runway were planted by
leftist extremists who planned to assassinate him by destroying his
plane.
   Authorities disclosed late Monday that they had discovered six
homemade bombs loaded with plastic explosives and shrapnel at the
city airport of La Serena on the Pacific coast 300 miles north of
Santiago.
   Attached to each bomb were about 300 sticks of dynamite,
according to a communique issued by the Civil Aviation office.
   The bombs were buried at the western end of the runway and
connected to a 2,000-foot-long detonating cable that ran to a
ravine beside the airport.
   The explosives were discovered on Saturday, the communique said.
   Pinochet was to fly to La Serena on Jan. 29 to appear at an
agricultural fair, but canceled the visit at the last minute.
   On Tuesday, during a tour of southern Chile, he told reporters
there was evidence the bombs were planted in anticipation of his
visit.
   ``They knew I was going to the north and prepared the explosive
material that was found,'' he said during a stop in the town of
Maullin, 700 miles south of the capital. His remarks were carried
by Santiago radio stations.
   He said it was only by chance that he did not travel to La
Serena. ``There were a series of problems that obliged me to stay
in Santiago,'' he said.
   In September 1986, Pinochet survived an ambush of his motorcade
by a commando of the pro-communist Manuel Rodriguez Front, the
country's main lefitst guerrilla organization. Five of his
bodyguards were kiilled in the attack with machine-gun and rocket
fire.
   Pinochet, commander of the army, seized power in a 1973 coup
that toppled the elected government of Marxist President Salvador
Allende.

   A Molotov cocktail was dropped off a bridge
today onto one tugboat and flares were fired at another in violence
stemming from a 2-week-old longshoreman's strike, police said.
   The incendiary device bounced harmlessly off the tugboat, which
was towing a gasoline barge, and fell into the East River at 4
a.m., said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   About 5:30 a.m., several flares from a flare gun were fired from
a pier at a tugboat towing two city Sanitation Department barges,
but missed all three vessels, O'Donnell said. The flares were fired
from a pier at Newtown Creek, which empties into the East River and
divides the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.
   Late Monday, a Molotov cocktail was tossed from the Queensboro
Bridge onto a barge unloading 500,000 gallons of gasoline at the
Amoco Oil Storage facility. It ignited a small fire that was
extinguished quickly and caused only minor damage.
   Police have recorded more than a dozen violent incidents since
the strike began Feb. 16, including the wounding a week ago of a
tugboat captain when shots fired at his boat shattered the glass in
the pilot house.
   Negotiations between Local 333 of the International
Longshoremen's Association and five of the nine tugboat companies
being struck are to resume Thursday for the first time since the
strike began.
   At issue are concessions the tugboat companies are demanding
from the approximately 2,500 affected tugboat and barge workers.
   Al Cornette, Local 333 president, said earlier that union
members unanimously rejected the companies' demands for the
elimination of 750 jobs and for wage and benefit givebacks of up to
62 percent.
   Five companies had locked the workers out and four had not come
to terms, Cornette said. Those firms have been using replacement
workers, he said.
   The union has signed with nine other companies and 10 more had
unexpired contracts.

<TEXT>
   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould and her former husband
will reportedly receive up to $40,000 in a settlement with the
agency that brokered her contract to act as a surrogate mother in
the Baby M case.
   The agreement, signed in Manhattan by U.S. District Judge Pierre
N. Leval, dismisses the case without costs or attorneys' fees, but
does not reveal terms of the settlement.
   However, it was reported early last month that the Infertility
Center of New York and its founder, Noel Keane, agreed to pay the
couple $30,000 to $40,000.
   Keane, reached Tuesday at his law office in Dearborn, Mich.,
said only that ``attorneys' fees would have been much more'' than
his payment to the couple.
   The lawyer for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, Joel D. Siegal of Newark,
N.J., did not return a telephone call Tuesday.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Richard Whitehead, her husband at the
time the contract was signed, had charged in a lawsuit that the
Infertility Center and Keane committed fraud in the Baby M contract.
   The suit questioned whether Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was properly
counseled before becoming a surrogate mother.
   After being accepted by the center, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould signed
a contract with a Tenafly, N.J., couple, William and Elizabeth
Stern.
   Under the arrangement, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was to accept
$10,000 to become pregnant through artificial insemination with
Stern's sperm, and then relinquish the baby to the couple.
   However, after the baby was delivered, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould
launched a long, but ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to keep the
baby girl, now nearly 2 years old and living with the Sterns.

<HEAD>Australia Urges Poland To Allow Walesa Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Bill Hayden today
urged Poland to allow Lech Walesa, leader of the outlawed
Solidarity labor federation, to visit Australia.
   He said he cabled Poland's foreign minister, urging him to
approve Walesa's application to travel to Melbourne to attend a
four-day World Congress of the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions starting March 14.
   The Polish government said Tuesday it would bar Walesa and three
aides from attending the congress, citing the protection of
Poland's ``basic political interests.'' Walesa and the three other
Solidarity leaders have been trying to obtain passports to allow
them to attend the congress.
   They were invited by the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
   But Jerzy Urban, the government spokesman in Poland, said the
Solidarity delegation would be prevented from going to the congress
as representatives of ``a Polish trade union which was dissolved
and ceased to exist legally.''
   ``Walesa's and his colleagues' trip and their participation in
the Australian congress would be contradictory to the basic
political interests (of Poland) and would be a mockery of our legal
order,'' Urban told reporters.
   ``Polish law regulating passport affairs orders denials of
passports in such cases. Poland has the sovereign right to protect
its legal order.''
   Urban criticized some Australian trade union activists for
threatening to cut off water and electricity to the Polish
consulate in Sydney and the Polish Embassy in Canberra if Walesa
and his aides are refused passports, saying that such threats are
only ``inflaming the atmosphere.''
   He said Poland would not yield to the ``pressure of hooligan
threats'' toward its diplomatic missions, adding that it was
Australia's duty ``to guarantee the functioning of Polish consular
offices.''
   Walesa has not traveled abroad since the December 1981
imposition of martial law that crushed Solidarity.
   Also invited to Australia were Wroclaw Solidarity leader
Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Gdansk leader Bogdan Lis and senior adviser
Bronislaw Geremek.
   Walesa, contacted Tuesday at his Gdansk apartment, expressed
surprise and disappointment. ``Now I can see that as long as Urban
and company are in power I have no chance. Please let me know as
soon as you hear about Urban's end,'' said Walesa, the 1983 Nobel
Peace prize winner.
   ``I have no further comment,'' he said. ``We have to wait for
the reaction of trade unions and other organizations.''
   In Australia, trade unionists reacted angrily to Urban's
comments.
   ``We have a moral duty to protest against the Polish
authorities' actions and to back up our verbal condemnation with a
bit of action,'' said Michael Easson, assistant secretary of the
Trades and Labor Council of New South Wales.
   ``We reject the accusation by Polish authorities that Australian
unions were behaving like hooligans for insisting that Mr. Walesa
by granted permission to visit Australia,'' he added.
   Charles Weyman, ethnic affairs director for the Federated Iron
Workers, told his members to boycott Polish ships and cut off
water, gas and electricity supplies to the consul in Sydney and the
embassy in Canberra.

<HEAD>Communist Party Acknowledges Anti-Semitic Excesses Of 1968</HEAD>

   Authorities today acknowledged
``manifestations of anti-Semitism'' in a 1968 purge of
intellectuals and liberals that forced thousands of Jews out of the
Communist party, government and academia.
   An article in the Communist party daily Trybuna Ludu said
innocent people were harmed merely for advocating reform, but it
added that ``the predominant majority of party and state activists
had no part in anti-Semitism.''
   Addressing the 20th anniversary of the March 1968 event, the
1{-page article said some conservative, nationalist party factions
``took advantage of the Jewish ancestry'' of some of their
political rivals.
   ``Injustice was done to many people of Jewish descent as they
were removed from political and professional positions,
irrespective of their views and conduct,'' the paper said.
   But, it added, all the people in the conservative faction in the
intra-party struggle were not anti-Semitic, and some actively
disassociated themselves from anti-Semitism.
   About 9,000 Jews lost positions in the party, government,
academia and other official institutions in the purge. An estimated
12,000 to 20,000 Jews emigrated, the majority of the Jewish
population that remained after the Nazi Holocaust.
   The first word that the party was going to issue a revised
history of the 1968 ``anti-Zionist'' purges came at the end of
January in a speech by a Polish historian in Jerusalem.
   Two weeks ago, the party weekly Polityka printed a chronology of
the events with a critical introduction. But the Trybuna Ludu
article, which was reported by the state-run news agency PAP and
television, has the authority of an official party statement.
   Speaking more generally about the persecution of liberals at the
time, the party paper said, ``Identification of the pro-reformatory
movement with revisionist and anti-socialist movements was a
mistake on the part of the leadership.''
   It said the party leadership failed to make contact with the
leading intellectuals who made ``rational proposals of
democratization and who sought a dialogue with the authorities''
while recognizing the authority of the party.
   Discrimination against Jews, in the guise ``anti-Zionism,''
began after Israel's victory in the June 1967 Middle East war. But
it accelerated sharply in 1968.
   Before World War II, Poland was home to more than 3.5 million
Jews _ more than half the world's Jewry. There are now believed to
be between 7,000 and 15,000 Jews, with not a rabbi among them.
   ``All the obscenities of the March (1968) propaganda campaign
have been repeated, all of them,'' said Adam Michnik, a prominent
opposition activist and historian who was a student leader in 1968
and a chief target of anti-Semitic attacks.
   ``What has been done is nothing but cosmetics,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   A leading party theoretician and journalist, Ludwik Krasucki,
said on Polish television Tuesday that the party's attempts to
reconsider the history of the period were vital.
   He expressed hope that with a thorough re-examination of the
period, in all its aspects, ``this chapter, which nevertheless
can't be forgotten, shall once and for all be closed.''

<TEXT>
   Less than a week ago, Eric Arturo Delvalle was
reviled in much of the hemisphere as a figurehead president of
Panama, a tool of the country's military establishment, a man who
gave Panama's political system a constitutional facade.
   But, in a single stroke, Delvalle has carried out a remarkable
political rehabilitation. He has been transformed from Delvalle the
Meek to Delvalle the Martyr.
   Much of the Reagan administration's strategy toward Panama over
the past few days has been built around Delvalle and his claim to
be Panama's constitutional president.
   He is an integral part of the administration's ``chipmunk
strategy'' toward Panama _ keep gnawing away at Panama's economy,
at military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega's claim to legitimacy
and his reputation and base of support at home and abroad.
   In time, the administration hopes, Noriega will wake up, find
his hold on power has evaporated and depart his homeland quietly.
The administration wanted a democratic symbol around whom
Panamanians could rally, and found one in Delvalle, the man who
defied Noriega, the armed forces chieftain, political heavyweight
and, according to a federal indictment, cocaine smuggler. For now,
at least, Delvalle has the earmarks of a Panamanian version of
Corazon Aquino, a democratic symbol around whom opposition to
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos coalesced.
   Delvalle's image as a powerless front man dates back to when he
took office in the fall of 1985. Noriega was unhappy with the
president at the time, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, because of an
independent streak, and he forced Barletta from office.
   Delvalle was sworn in as president under the most unpromising of
circumstances. In effect, he had to behave according to Noriega's
wishes or he would end up like Barletta. He carried that burden for
two years.
   The image he projects nowadays is quite different. A certain
mystique has developed around Delvalle since he tried to fire
Noriega and wound up out of office himself. Rather than flee the
country after his dismissal, he has gone into hiding, issuing
proclamations to his countrymen, making videotaped messages and
frustrating efforts by Noriega's forces to locate him.
   One of his chief allies these days is Gabriel Lewis, a former
ambassador to Washington who is now a captain of the anti-Noriega
campaign in exile.
   To hear Lewis tell it, Delvalle had wanted to break with Noriega
for five months but was reluctant to do so because of ``confusing''
signals from Washington.
   Lewis said Tuesday that Noriega has been suspicious of
Delvalle's intentions for some time and kept telling the president,
``Don't act against me because the gringos are behind me.''
   This was based on what Noriega felt were reassuring visits by
emissaries from Washington, including Assistant Defense Secretary
Richard Armitage.
   One turning point occurred in early January, Lewis said, when a
gathering of Panamanian opposition leaders met in Miami and
Delvalle sent an envoy.
   ``The emissary told us that if we gave him (Delvalle) assurances
that we would support him, he was ready to act and dismiss
Noriega,'' Lewis said.
   ``We sent him back a message,'' Lewis said. ``We have heard that
many times. We want deeds and not words. If you fire Noriega and
his cronies, we will give you support.''
   Contacts with Lewis and other Noriega opponents continued, with
some messages being passed by Delvalle's dentist in Florida.
Another turning point took place in early February when two Florida
grand juries charged that Noriega was a key figure in an
international drug smuggling ring.
   With an end to the ambiguity in Washington's position, the
opposition front suggested that Delvalle come here to announce his
break with Noriega before the Organization of American States.
Delvalle agreed and arrangements were made.
   But then Delvalle had second thoughts, reasoning that firing
Noriega at OAS headquarters in Washington might be seen ``as acting
on instructions from the United States,'' Lewis said. But was
Delvalle getting cold feet?
   At Lewis' instigation, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called
Delvalle to give him encouragement. On Feb. 17, Delvalle was in
Miami and invited Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams to
visit him.
   If Delvalle was ousted for trying to fire Noriega, Abrams
assured him, the United States would support him as Panama's
constitutional president, Lewis said. Eight days later, in an
important moment in Panama's tumultuous history, Delvalle fired
Noriega only to be dismissed himself hours later by Noriega's
allies in the National Assembly.
   Lewis said the turn of events was foreseen in an 18-point
anti-Noriega conspiracy crafted by the opposition coalition.
   He said the program is up to point six. Twelve to go.

<HEAD>Conservative Paper Sparks New Unrest at Dartmouth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police have been guarding the offices of a
conservative weekly newspaper that has revived stinging attacks on
a black professor and reawakened charges of racism at Dartmouth
College.
   A march through the school's Fraternity Row and continued
picketing of several businesses that advertise in The Dartmouth
Review were planned today, and a larger rally was scheduled for
Thursday.
   Four Review staff members face college disciplinary charges and
possible expulsion stemming from a confrontation last week with
William Cole, a music professor who once sued the paper for libel.
   The staffers say they are being persecuted for taking strong
stands on the quality of Dartmouth life and education, and deny
that race has anything to do with it.
   The independent newspaper also was at the center of controversy
two years ago when 12 students, mostly Review staffers, took
sledgehammers to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the campus
green. That raid sparked a semester of sit-ins, disciplinary
hearings and other unrest that caused a leadership crisis for
Dartmouth President David McLaughlin.
   McLaughlin resigned in June 1987, though he said the
disturbances didn't contribute directly to his decision.
   As tensions rise again, McLaughlin's successor, James Freedman,
said Tuesday he would ``urge everyone in the Dartmouth community to
take the high road to civility of expression.''
   Freedman had a similar message Monday when he spoke to 250
students at a rally protesting the Review's attacks on Cole. He
defended Cole's qualifications, as well as the right to freedom of
speech, ``however unpopular, provocative and offensive that speech
may sometimes be.''
   Cole sued the paper in 1983 for libel over an article that said
he ``looks like a used Brillo pad.'' He dropped the suit in 1985.
He received no damages and both sides claimed vindication.
   Two weeks ago the Review published a cover story calling Cole's
teaching performance ``academically deficient'' and including
excerpts from a transcript from one of his recent classes.
   On Thursday four Review staffers approached Cole after a class.
Editor-in-chief Chris Baldwin said the staffers wanted to give Cole
a chance to rebut their article, and to demand that he apologize
for allegedly calling them ``white-boy racists'' during a class.
   Shouting ensued, and the incident ended with the professor
allegedly breaking the camera flash of Review photographer John
Quilhot. The Review published a photograph of an agitated Cole on
its cover in its next issue with the headline, ``The Truth Hurts.
Cole Explodes Over Review Criticism.''
   Cole has not commented publicly on the incidents.
   Three police officers stood guard Tuesday outside the Review's
office above a hardware store a block from the Dartmouth campus.
   Nearby, hoisting signs that urged motorists to ``Honk if you
don't support the Review,'' about 25 people picketed the Dartmouth
Bookstore and other stores that advertise in the Review.
   The four Review staffers face punishment ranging from a fine to
expulsion if they are found guilty of disorderly conduct,
harassment, or violating Cole's right to privacy. They are Baldwin,
a junior from Hinsdale, Ill.; Quilhot, a sophomore from Fort Wayne,
Ind.; executive editor John Sutter, a senior from St. Louis; and
staff writer Sean Nolan, a freshman from Lexington, Mass.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Disputes Gromyko's Memoirs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry said today that many aspects
of Soviet President Andrei Gromyko's memoirs dealing with
Chinese-Soviet relations are false.
   ``Many of the recollections and descriptions in Gromyko's
memoirs relating to the history and present state of Chinese-Soviet
relations do not square with the facts,'' ministry spokeswoman Li
Jinghua told a weekly news briefing.
   She refused to elaborate on what elements in the memoirs China
disputed.
   The New York Times, quoting an advance copy of Gromyko's
two-volume book ``Memoir,'' said Gromyko claimed Chinese leader Mao
Tse-tung proposed in 1958 that the Soviet Union help lure U.S.
troops into China and attack them there with nuclear weapons.
   Gromyko wrote that Mao was expecting a U.S. attack on mainland
China because of Washington's support for the Nationalist Chinese
government on Taiwan and tensions over the tiny islands of Quemoy
and Matsu in the Taiwan Strait.
   Gromyko said in ``Memoir'' that he rejected the plan, proposed
while he was on a secret August 1958 visit to China, according to
the Times.
   Ms. Li confirmed that Gromyko, then Soviet foreign minister,
visited China in 1958. She refused to comment on the purpose of the
trip or the content of his talks with Mao.
   At the time, the Soviet Union had close ties with the younger
communist state and provided it with economic and military aid. The
two countries split bitterly a few years later over ideological and
strategic differences.
   ``Memoir'' is due to be distributed soon to Soviet bookstores.
It covers nearly 50 years of Soviet diplomacy, including relations
with nine U.S. presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald
Reagan, the Times said.

   A former congressman who has accused GOP
presidential contender Pat Robertson of ducking combat duty in
Korea said today the candidate is ``chickening out'' by trying to
drop his libel suit.
   ``He's chickening out of the trial just like he chickened out 37
years ago,'' said former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif. ``The
courtroom's a great place to learn the truth. ... Now that he's up
with the truth to be told and testimony under oath, he's backing
off.''
   Robertson, who faced a trial date on Super Tuesday _ the day 20
states hold primaries and caucuses, said Tuesday he wants to drop
his $35 million libel suit against McCloskey.
   ``In order to compete in that trial, I would have to break off
my campaign today and run the risk of losing Florida, Texas, South
Carolina and other parts of the South,'' Robertson told reporters
in Sarasota, Fla.
   ``That was an impossible decision for me to make and an unfair
one,'' he added.
   But McCloskey, who insists Robertson invoked his late father's
political influence to avoid combat in the Korean War, said he will
oppose the former television evangelist's request to drop the case.
   ``I think the truth ought to be told,'' McCloskey said on ``CBS
This Morning.'' ``I don't know any better place to get the truth
than in the courtroom. He invoked the process, he ought to go
through with it.''
   McCloskey said he fears that an individual who avoided combat in
his youth may try to make amends in the White House.
   ``You know when you get a president in office who has evaded
combat in his youth and all his advisers are saying look tough
against the Soviets ... I think there is a tendency to try to prove
your manhood late in life,'' McCloskey said.
   Robertson's lawyers called a news conference at their Washington
offices today to discuss their decision to ask U.S. District Judge
Joyce Hens Green to dismiss the lawsuit.
   ``She can't force a plaintiff to continue the suit,'' Robertson
said.
   But under the civil rules of procedure, the judge could force
Robertson to go to trial unless he pays McCloskey's legal expenses
of nearly $400,000.
   ``We are prepared to go to trial,'' said McCloskey's lawyer,
George Lehner, adding that the former congressman has long insisted
that Robertson pay his legal fees as a condition for any settlement.
   The case involves a 1986 letter that McCloskey wrote to Rep.
Andrew Jacobs Jr., D-Ind., alleging that Robertson used the
political influence of his father, the late Sen. A. Willis
Robertson, D-Va., to get out of combat duty in the Korean War.
   McCloskey, a decorated Marine, was aboard a troop ship from
which Robertson was removed during a stop in Japan before the ship
proceeded to Korea. He quoted Robertson as telling fellow Marines
that his father had helped him get out of combat.
   In the letter that was published by two syndicated newspaper
columns, McCloskey also said the former television evangelist was
later assigned to be a ``booze officer'' to a rear-echelon unit in
Korea.
   Robertson called McCloskey ``a patent liar.''
   But McCloskey, a liberal Republican who once sought the
Republican presidential nomination as an opponent of President
Nixon's Vietnam War policies, has found a number of ex-Marines who
served in Korea who support his story.
   The former congressman also said today that A. Willis Robertson,
in letters written during the war, thanked the Marine Corps for
assuring that his son would not be involved in combat. McCloskey's
lawyers subpoenad the letters, which had been left to William &
Mary College.
   A trial, as scheduled, would have resulted in extensive
publicity about the allegations as Robertson is trying to win votes
in the presidential race. As early as last fall, Robertson
expressed regrets over filing the politically troublesome lawsuit,
telling Time magazine: ``In all candor, I think it was a bad idea.''
   Robertson, who had earlier called Judge Green ``patently
unfair'' for refusing to postpone the trial, said Tuesday that she
``had done everything she can to get us to drop the case.''
   Robertson proposed that he and McCloskey submit their case to
the Iowa Libel Dispute Program run by the University of Iowa's law
school and the American Arbitration Association.
   If McCloskey refuses, Robertson says he will seek to drop the
lawsuit anyway and put the facts of the case to an unspecified
panel of experts.
   ``We will prove to the American people that he truly doesn't
want the truth to come out,'' Robertson said.
   Lehner called the proposal for arbitration ``a red herring,''
and noted that the idea had been rejected by Robertson's own
lawyers nine months ago.

<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old woman could be sentenced to
up to four years in jail and fined $10,000 in the deaths of her two
children last summer in a locked, sun-baked car.
   Lisa Shields, of White Township, pleaded guilty Tuesday to
reduced charges in the deaths of Kristle, 3, and Calvin Shields, 1.
   Washington County Judge John Bell accepted pleas to two counts
of endangering the welfare of children, and Indiana County District
Attorney William Martin agreed to drop two counts of involuntary
manslaughter. No sentencing date was set.
   Mrs. Shields' 24-year-old husband, John Shields, goes on trial
March 14 on charges of involuntary manslaughter and endangering the
welfare of children.
   Mrs. Shields stopped her trial, which began Monday, and pleaded
guilty after her husband testified that he had agreed to care for
the children and had locked them in the car while his wife slept.
   Shields said he hid the car in which the children were sleeping
in a sunny area at the rear of a farmhouse after a friend told him
a warrant had been issued for his arrest because the car had no
license plates and was not registered.
   He said he closed the car windows ``because it was supposed to
rain'' and locked the doors because ``I didn't want anyone taking
my kids.''
   Shields said he left the children in the car because the house
was unheated and had broken windows.
   Earlier Tuesday, Dr. William Kenney, a Penn State University
assistant professor of physiology, said the temperature in the car
probably reached 150 degrees, which the children could have
withstood for 17 minutes.
   Both parents have been in jail since their arrests shortly after
the children's deaths in August.

<HEAD>Accused Drug Trafficker's Lawyer Says Oliver North Will Plead
Fifth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer seeking Lt. Col. Oliver North's
testimony in a drug trial says the ex-National Security Council
aide will refuse to answer questions by invoking his constitutional
right against self-incrimination.
   Ronald C. Dresnick, who obtained subpoenas last week against
North and two other figures in the Iran-Contra affair, said Tuesday
he had not decided whether to pursue his bid to compel North to
appear March 15 in U.S. District Court in Detroit.
   However, the attorney said he believed North could provide
information to support his claim that his client, Frank Ivan Turek
Correa, of Colombia, was a victim of entrapment or other government
misconduct.
   Dresnick said he wanted to question North about Michael Palmer,
a former airline pilot whom Dresnick claimed was being protected
from prosecution.
   Palmer accompanied Correa and other defendants on an airplane
that allegedly carried drugs from South America to Michigan, the
attorney said. But Dresnick said he believed Palmer was allowed to
go free because the government wanted to conceal his alternate role
in shipping food and clothing to the Contra rebels trying to topple
the government of Nicaragua.
   Dresnick, in court papers seeking to subpoena North, said the
DC-6 airplane allegedly used to ship the drugs to Michigan was once
owned by Vortex Air International. Palmer is a former executive
with both Vortex and Southern Air Transport, which Dresnick called
a CIA-backed operation.
   ``I believe the government knows about Palmer and ... must be
aware that Palmer was involved in drug smuggling,'' Dresnick said.
   Palmer also has been subpoenaed to testify in Detroit, but his
whereabouts are unknown, Dresnick said. The attorney said he was
forced to subpoena North because of the government's refusal to
produce Palmer.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Donaldson acknowledged Tuesday
that Palmer was not included in a Sept. 24, 1987, indictment naming
Correa and seven other defendants. He said the government had no
interest in North's testimony and declined further comment.
   Dresnick said Barry Simon, a Washington attorney representing
North, told him by telephone Monday that his client ``indicated he
will take the Fifth Amendment.''
   ``If that's all that's going to happen, it's a little pointless
to drag him out (to Detroit) to say that,'' Dresnick said.
   Simon, contacted Monday night, had declined to say whether North
would appear in Detroit and would not answer any other questions.

   More than 2,000 Libyan soldiers have
entered northwestern Sudan to launch an offensive against Chad, the
government radio of Chad said.
   N'djamena radio said the troops joined thousands of other
soldiers already stationed in Sudan's Darfour province ``with the
complicity of the Khartoum authorities.'' The report Tuesday night
was monitored in Abidjan.
   The column included regular soldiers from the Libyan army as
well as mercenaries, the radio said. It added that Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi was planning an attack.
   Chad and Libya have been observing a cease-fire in their war
over the disputed Anzou strip, a mineral-rich area that lies
between the two countries. The cease-fire was arranged by the
Organization of African States last September.
   Chad frequently has accused Libya of using Sudan to launch
attacks against it.
   ``As for Khartoum and its government, Chad reiterates its appeal
for a sense of responsibility to avoid turning the Sudanese
territory into a powder keg and an aggression base against a
neighboring and brotherly country. Otherwise, Chad will assume its
responsibility,'' the radio said.
   A special Organization of African Unity committee is to meet in
Dakar, Senegal, on April 10 to negotiate a settlement in the
Chad-Libya conflict.

<HEAD>Aquino Relative Says Marcos' Cancer Ruled Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed President Ferdinand Marcos
said his doctors once suspected he had cancer but surgery proved
the diagnosis wrong, an uncle of President Corazon Aquino reported
today.
   Rep. Francisco Sumulong said through a spokesman that Marcos
told him of the preliminary diagnosis when the two men met in
Hawaii in early February. He said Marcos had thyroid surgery in
October, after which doctors ruled out cancer.
   On Tuesday, the Peoples Journal Tonight quoted Sumulong as
saying that Marcos was in declining health and may be suffering
from cancer. A Marcos spokesman in Honolulu denied the report in
the Manila newspaper.
   Sumulong and Mrs. Aquino's cousin, Rep. Egmidio Tanjuatco, met
separately with Marcos earlier this year in Hawaii, where the
former president has lived since he was ousted in a
military-civilian revolt in February 1986.
   Marcos spokesman Leonie Tan confirmed the meetings but denied
that the former president had used his health to strike any deals
with the Aquino government for his return.
   ``He's in excellent health,'' Tan said. ``He has regular medical
check-ups and definitely does not have cancer.''
   Mrs. Aquino said in Manila on Tuesday that before Marcos would
be allowed to return he must return billions of dollars he
allegedly took from the country he ruled for 20 years.
   Marcos repeatedly has denied stealing money from the
Philippines, and Tan said he had not offered to pay any money back.
   ``No deal has been struck, indeed, not a single item on the
agenda has been decided,'' Tan said.
   It is not known when negotiations for Marcos return will start,
``but the desire from both sides is that talks begin immediately,''

<TEXT>
   The coach of the Romanian bobsled team
refused to return home after the Winter Olympic Games and has asked
for asylum in Canada, police and Olympic sources said.
   City police Supt. Len Esler said Tuesday a man approached two
police officers at the athletes' village at the University of
Calgary on Monday night and ``requested political asylum.''
   He was taken to a police station, where immigration officers
picked him up and placed him in protective custody. Esler refused
to say who the team official was or give his nationality ``for his
safety and the safety of his family.''
   But police and Olympic sources identified him as Dumitru
Focseneanu, who was listed as the Romanian bobsled coach staying at
the Olympic village.
   Focseneanu was in Calgary last December as the 22-member team's
coach during World Cup competition.
   The Romanian Embassy in Ottawa refused comment.
   Wilf Lindner, manager of the Calgary immigration center, said
the man had not yet formally applied for refugee status and would
be given two or three days ``to reflect on his position without
undue pressure.''
   ``His refugee status is to be decided at a later date,'' Lindner
said. ``All decisions are made on a case-to-case basis. We have his
request to remain in Canada, nothing else.''
   Lindner said no other Olympic-related requests to remain in
Canada had been received by the Calgary office. But during the
first week of the Games, three Romanian speed skaters and their
coach abruptly departed amid speculation they were planning to
defect.

<HEAD>True Light Church Members Fined for Violating Child Labor Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge rebuked Shiloh True Light
Church of Christ for exploiting children and cited church members
for contempt of court for violating federal child labor laws.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter also ordered two companies
owned and operated by church members to pay $203,272 to cover a
federal investigation and litigation expenses and to pay employees
back wages and interest.
   The actions Tuesday further set back the church's campaign to
stop what it calls government interference with its religious
beliefs.
   Potter ruled that church members and the two companies _ McGee
Brothers Co. Inc. of Union County and Wendell's Woodwork Inc. of
Mint Hill _ violated his October 1987 order to obey federal child
labor laws.
   True Light families educate their children at home. The church
also sponsors a job-training program that gives youths the
opportunity to earn money while learning such trades as
bricklaying, woodworking and sewing.
   Church members acknowledged during the trial they used their
children, some as young as 9, at construction sites and in
workshops where they carried bricks, laid foundations and more
recently, operated forklifts and power saws. They said they had
been doing that for at least 100 years.
   In October, Potter ordered children to stop working for the
companies. When the owners of the companies continued the program
for the church, the Labor Department asked they be found in
contempt.
   In separate judgments, Potter ordered both companies again to
obey the laws and warned that McGee Brothers would be fined $10,000
and Wendell's Woodwork $5,000 for each day the companies remain in
contempt of his order.
   In addition, Potter said Wendell's two owners _ Wendell Long and
Herbert Long _ would be fined $500 each per day that they remained
in contempt of his order. The five brothers who own McGee Brothers
face fines of $1,000 per day each if they remain in contempt.
   Potter also ordered McGee Brothers to pay $133,890 in back wages
and interest to employees who had not been paid minimum wages and
for overtime work.
   Calls to both companies' offices and the offices of their
attorneys for comment were not returned.
   ``We feel like our freedom of religion and freedom of worship
has been violated,'' said Rommie Purser, the church's minister.
``We just plan to go on to the Supreme Court and see if we aren't
being denied freedom of worship.''
   In a January trial, the Labor Department charged the owners of
the two companies _ all of whom are members of the church _ with
violating the federal statute against child labor.
   The judge wrote in his 58-page opinion that the children
employed ``are children doing adult's work, and regardless of the
label defendants have attached to them, i.e. `trainees in Shiloh
Vocational Training Program,' they are manifestly being exploited
by defendants in this case, whether or not they proclaim their
purpose to be in furtherance of their religious beliefs.''

<TEXT>
   Two Scandinavian U.N. relief workers
freed from 25 days in captivity said today that their Moslem
abductors moved them often, did not reveal their identities and
treated them well.
   Swede Jan Stening, 44, and Norwegian William Jorgensen, 58, who
were freed by their abductors Tuesday night, made the comments at a
packed news conference at a hotel in Christian east Beirut.
   ``We were very well treated during the whole period of
captivity,'' said Stening. Jorgensen said Stening was speaking for
``both of us.''
   Stening said neither of them had any idea about the identity of
their captors, their motives or their demands.
   ``All our guards were masked,'' Stening said. ``We changed
locations seven or eight times. We never knew where we were held at
any time.''
   ``We were held together ... Both of us were blindfolded at the
beginning for an hour or so but then the blindfolds were removed
and we were allowed to talk freely to each other,'' Stening said.
``We were moved from one location to another at night and in the
trunks of the cars,'' Stening added.
   He said their captors ``interrogated us in a polite manner,
asking such questions as the names of countries we worked at and
the kind of jobs we had.''
   After the news conference, the former hostages left Lebanon in a
U.N. helicopter from Christian east Beirut for Larnaca, Cyprus.
They then departed Larnaca for Zurich, Switzerland, aboard a
regular Swissair flight for their journey home.
   Stening said four gunmen kidnapped them near south Lebanon's
provincial capital of Sidon as they were driving in a U.N. car from
their base in the southern port of Tyre to Beirut on Feb. 5.
   Asked whether either one could tell if the kidnappers were
Palestinians or Lebanese, judging by their accent, Stening said in
English: ``No. We haven't the slightest idea. I don't know Arabic.''
   The two worked for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which cares
for 280,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
   Jorgensen said ``yes'' when asked whether he would be willing to
return to work for the agency in Sidon after their ordeal.
   John Fennessey of Ireland,the agency's acting director, told
reporters at the news conference that the two former captives
``wish to join their families as soon as possible and we're going
to fulfill that'' request.
   The first word about the release came in a handwritten Arabic
statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut late Tuesday.
   It was accompanied by a picture showing the two men. It said
after they were ``proved innocent, they were released.''
   The statement did not say what they had been accused of, but in
earlier statements the group claimed the men were involved with the
intelligence service of an unidentified foreign power. U.N.
officials blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting individually
for personal, not political, motives.
   The kidnappers of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who
was abducted in south Lebanon Feb. 17, said in a statement released
Tuesday they would put him on trial. They accused Higgins of
working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which claimed
Higgins' abduction, said Israel's crackdown on anti-occupation
Palestinian riots in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Middle
East trip of U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``make us
more determined to try this criminal, Higgins.''
   Both the United Nations and the United States have denied that
Higgins, who served with the U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon, was a CIA spy.
   Reporters in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, said the two
Scandinavians were turned over by their abductors at 8 p.m. Tuesday
to Palestine Liberation Organization representative Salah Salah.
   They were then driven to Beirut by the militia of leftist Sunni
Moslem leader Mustafa Saad, who controlled the city since the 1975
outbreak of the Lebanese civil war.
   Higgins, 43, was abducted near south Lebanon's ancient port of
Tyre. He heads a 76-man U.N. observer group that monitors truce
violations on the Lebanon-Israel border under a 1949 armistice
agreement.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth is believed to be
made up of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. It previously claimed
responsibility for kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews in west Beirut and
said it killed eight of them.
   In all, 23 foreigners are missing after being kidnapped in
Lebanon since March 1985. They are nine Americans, four Frenchmen,
three Britons, two West Germans, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian
and two unidentified men.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Newspaper Poll Shows Robertson Strength Among SC Southern Baptist
Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper poll of Baptist ministers in South
Carolina shows former television evangelist Pat Robertson with a
plurality of support in the influential group, despite its
theological differences with the Republican presidential candidate.
   Robertson has said he has to win South Carolina's Republican
primary Saturday, three days before the Super Tuesday primaries in
other mostly Southern states. About 700,000 of South Carolina's 3
million people are Southern Baptists, with about 2,000 ministers.
   A poll conducted last weekend by The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution showed Robertson with the support of 31
percent of the ministers who plan to vote Saturday.
   Vice President George Bush was second at 24 percent, followed by
17 percent for Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and 10 percent for New York
Rep. Jack Kemp.
   Although Robertson is a former Southern Baptist minister _ he
stepped down as he began his presidential campaign _ he comes from
a charismatic branch of the denomination, believing, among other
things, in faith-healing and speaking in tongues. Most of the
fundamentalist members of the denomination reject such teachings.

   State Republican party officials say the
large turnout expected for Saturday's presidential primary is
stretching their manpower to the limits.
   The party still is looking for volunteers to help man the polls
and will probably have to combine some precincts, officials said.
   ``Any time you try to man 1,800 precincts with volunteers, it's
a lot of work,'' said state Republican Party Executive Director
Tony Denny. ``Some counties have got it licked and are in good
shape, others are struggling and trying to find volunteers during
the last minute.
   ``But I think we'll get the precincts open.''
   The largest primary race the GOP has held in the state came in
the 1980 presidential campaign, which drew about 145,000 voters,
Denny said.
   He is anticipating a turnout of about 175,000 Saturday. Denny
said regular June primary elections never have drawn more than
approximately 60,000 voters statewide.

   The Texas State Teachers Association has
dropped its endorsement of Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, dealing
another blow to a presidential campaign that a Simon official said
has been misconstrued as dead in the South.
   The TSTA, Tuesday switched to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
as its candidate in next Tuesday's Texas Democratic presidential
primary. TSTA, with 95,000 members is the state's largest teacher
organization.
   ``While Sen. Simon's strong national record on education
prompted our endorsement, his decision not to campaign in Texas
forced us to reassess our position,'' TSTA President Charles Beard
said at a news conference.
   Simon announced last week he does not have sufficient money to
mount full campaigns in the Super Tuesday states, including Texas.
But Bob Krueger, Simon's Texas chairman, said Tuesday that Simon is
running in Texas and expects to earn some delegates.
   Simon will campaign in Texas on Monday and Tuesday, according to
Krueger.

<HEAD>Robertson To Hit Spending Ceiling In South Carolina</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson apparently will be the only
one of the four Republican presidential candidates to hit the legal
spending limit for Saturday's South Carolina primary, campaign
officials say.
   About 25 percent of the money Robertson is spending in South
Carolina will go into television advertising, which includes a 30
minute television ad expected to air Thursday or Friday night in
Greenville, Charleston and Columbia markets, said Kerry Moody,
Robertson's national deputy press secretary.
   The bulk of the money has gone into field organization efforts,
including distribution of 200,000 tapes titled ``Pat Robertson:
What I Will Do as President.''
   In New Hampshire, Robertson sent more than 200,000 tapes, and in
last week's South Dakota race, he sent 206,585 tapes.
   Robertson also spent the legal limits in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The limit set by the Federal Election Commission for South Carolina
is $916,099.

   Vice President George Bush, buoyed by
polls showing him with a comfortable lead in the South, said today
no candidate can win the nomination without winning on Super
Tuesday.
   ``You cannot design a strategy to be president of the United
States without doing well in the Super Tuesday states,'' Bush said
at a breakfast with supporters here at the start of a campaign day
that will take him to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and South
Carolina.
   Bush said Tuesday he wants to keep ``a rather high plane'' in
the closing days of the Super Tuesday campaign.
   But when asked about a television advertisement in which Dole
attacks him on the Iran-Contra affair, Bush told reporters: ``We'll
see whether it helps him, but I think I have every right to set the
record straight. You ought not to be surprised if you see some
comparative ads.
   ``You know, we're not going to sit out there unprotected,'' he
added.
   After a swing through South Florida on Tuesday, Bush planned to
breakfast today with senior citizens in Pinellas County, then head
on to Mississippi and Louisiana campaign events.
   Bush said that he is confident but not cocky about the campaign
for the March 8 Super Tuesday of 20 primaries and caucuses, most in
the South. A Washington Post-ABC poll released today gave him a 3-1
lead over Dole.
   ``Two weeks ago yesterday, the polls (in New Hampshire, where he
won the primary) showed me on the canvas; and the voters said
different. I'm not going to get overconfident (because polls show
him leading in the South),'' said Bush.
   The vice president campaigned Tuesday with former Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee from Arizona,
and Florida Gov. Bob Martinez.
   In recent days, Dole has made a point of saying he is the only
candidate ``tough enough'' to deal with the problems a president
faces.
   Bush replied with an appearance that played up his combat
record. When he arrived at the Tampa airport, a Grumman Avenger
plane, the same model he flew during World War II, had been brought
from a nearby air museum. He climbed into the cockpit.
   Later, Bush drove a paving machine at the construction site of a
North Miami Beach development.
   Bush's mother, who lives in Palm Beach, briefly joined him. Also
campaigning with Bush in Tampa was his son Jeb, who is Florida's
Secretary of Commerce.

   The mediator through nearly six years of peace
talks on Afghanistan opened a crucial and perhaps final round today
and said he was sure it would lead to the withdrawal of Soviet
troops.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez said ``difficult'' problems
remained but that he believed both sides were determined to
overcome them and reach a settlement as soon as possible.
   Cordovez said the negotiations would last as long as was
necessary to forge that settlement.
   ``Perhaps it will be signed earlier than you think,'' he added.
   ``I have the impression that the Afghan people are tired of this
conflict, that they will want peace,'' Cordovez said. He did not
specify what problems remained, citing a need of confidentiality
that allowed the parties to be ``flexible''
   Cordovez spoke to reporters shortly before beginning his shuttle
between the Pakistani and Afghan delegations, seated in separate
rooms in the Geneva office of the United Nations.
   The indirect format was adopted because Pakistan, representing
the anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas, does not recognize the
Soviet-backed Afghan government of President Najib.
   Cordovez said he had been in contact with representatives of
several countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union,
the European Community and Australia, to discuss humanitarian aid
to Afghanistan after a settlement.
   ``I have the feeling that there will be a broad international
effort,'' he said.
   Pakistan has insisted that pullout of the 115,000 Soviet troops
from Afghanistan be accompanied by formation of a broad-based
transitional government to replace the Afghan regime.
   The Soviets intervened in 1979 to back the Kabul government
against Moslem insurgents.
   Pakistan's chief negotiator, Minister of State Zain Noorani,
said Pakistan came to Geneva with a ``constructive attitude to
finalize the text of the peace package.''
   The head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil,
did not renew charges that Pakistan's demand for an interim
government threatens to thwart a settlement.
   Both held separate news conferences on Tuesday.
   Wakil said he approached the talks with a ``sense of full
optimism.''
   Asked whether Pakistan would sign the peace package with the
Najib government, Noorani said that would be decided after
consultations in Islamabad on Sunday with ``national leaders,''
including opposition leaders.
   The Geneva talks will recess to allow Noorani to take part in
those talks.
   Noorani said Pakistan would continue to press for an interim
government acceptable to all Afghans to be created in conjunction
with a Soviet withdrawal.
   Otherwise, he said, there is a threat of new bloodshed
preventing the return to Afghanistan of more than 3 million refuges
from Pakistan and another 2 million from Iran.
   ``We also seek cooperation of the Soviet Union,'' said Noorani.
``We feel that after 8{ years of occupation, the Soviets owe it to
the people of Afghanistan to give them a durable peace.''
   Wakil said Afghanistan has no preconditions for the makeup of
the future government.
   But seven Pakistan-based resistance movements that claim to
speak for the about 200,000 Moslem guerrillas have ruled out any
power-sharing with Najib. Last week, they presented their own plan
for an ``Islamic government.''
   Kabul immediately rejected the plan, which Noorani described as
a ``positive proposal.''
   The talks have moved rapidly since Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's Feb. 8 announcement that Moscow would bring its troops
home within 10 months starting May 15, provided a Geneva settlement
is signed by March 15.
   Noorani said the March 15 date ``is not all that important'' and
that he is sure Soviet withdrawal plans would not be upset if the
signing came later.
   He said the timetable for the pullout is now within ``negotiable
range,'' but he indicated there are still considerable differences.
   Pakistan wants at least half the Soviet troops to leave during
the first three months of a pullout, Noorani said. Gorbachev has
been vague on the subject, which is directly related to the
question of a cutoff in Western aid to the guerrillas.
   The United States is reported to have given the guerrillas $700
million last year.
   Wakil said agreements already drawn up provide for the cutoff to
coincide with the start of the Soviet pullout.
   The Afghan monarchy was overthrown in 1978 and a communist
government was installed. The Soviets intervened at the request of
the embattled new Marxist government.

<HEAD>Doctor Now Says Boy Doesn't Have AIDS Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The doctor for three AIDS-exposed brothers
who were ostracized in their hometown has retracted his diagnosis
of AIDS-related complex for the oldest boy.
   Jerry Barbosa testified at a hearing Tuesday that he earlier
made the diagnosis for 11-year-old Ricky Ray because he felt
compelled to under a judge's order.
   AIDS-related complex, or ARC, often is a precursor to acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. There is no known cure for AIDS.
   ``The way I interpreted the order, I had no choice but to label
this patient as having ARC against my clinical judgment,'' Barbosa
told U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth A. Jenkins.
   The purpose of Tuesday's hearing was to clarify earlier reports
that the physician had diagnosed ARC in the youth weeks before
reporting it to the court.
   On Jan. 29, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich modified
an earlier order and required Barbosa to report the progress of
``any AIDS, AIDS symptomology, or other AIDS-related syndrome.''
   Her wording prompted him to say in his Feb. 2 report that Ricky
had developed ARC, Barbosa said.
   But Ricky has not exhibited physical symptoms necessary for such
a finding, although the boy's blood tests might support an ARC
diagnosis, the doctor said. He also cited April 1987 guidelines
issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta that
prohibit labeling any child under age 13 as having ARC.
   ``It doesn't mean much to the court that somebody has or doesn't
have ARC,'' Ms. Jenkins said. ``When material changes in the boys'
health occurs, it is not up to the court to try to look behind the
medical reports to see what is there.''
   When Ms. Kovachevich ruled Aug. 5, 1987, that the DeSoto County
School system had to readmit the Ray brothers to regular classes,
she ordered AIDS testing of the boys every six months and said any
changes in their condition had to be reported to her.
   Ms. Jenkins told attorneys for the Rays and the school board to
devise an improved way to keep the court informed about the
hemophiliac brothers' medical conditions. The attorneys must submit
the plan by Monday.
   Ricky, Robert, 10, and Randy, 8, were banned from regular
classes after they tested positive for the AIDS antibody in August
1986. Doctors say the children were apparently exposed to the AIDS
virus through infusions of blood products that aim to promote
clotting.
   Soon after the boys began school in Arcadia last fall, amid a
boycott and protests by other students' parents, an arsonist
torched the Ray home. Since then, the family has moved to Sarasota,
where the Ray children have attended public school without incident.

<TEXT>
   A group of 300 Austrians has asked state
prosecutors to investigate whether President Kurt Waldheim can be
prosecuted on suspicion of murder, a spokesman for the group said
today.
   A petition asking that Waldheim be prosecuted in connection with
his World War II service as an officer in the Nazi army has been
circulating among intellectuals and at anti-Waldheim demonstrations
for the past three weeks.
   The left-wing Vienna magazine Falter today published the text of
the complaint, which it said was signed by 300 people, including
two prominent writers _ Robert Jungk and Erich Fried.
   Walter Oswalt, a journalist and spokesman for the group, said
the complaint was sent to the Vienna state prosecutor's office by
registered mail and was delivered this morning.
   Later, Waldheim asked state prosecutors to sue Falter on grounds
of defamation and asked that it be removed from newsstands, the
president's spokesman, Gerold Christian, said.
   Waldheim has initiated four other similar suits, including one
against the West German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published
a document last month purportedly linking Waldheim to the
deportation of civilians to prison camps in 1944. The magazine
later said the document was a forgery and apologized for publishing
it.
   A spokesman for the state prosecutor's office said privacy laws
prevent the office confirming the receipt of the Austrian group's
complaint.
   The complaint quoted extensively from a historians' report on
Waldheim's wartime service, published Feb. 9, and from other
material to back its request for an investigation of Waldheim on
suspicion of murder.
   It cited an article in Austria's criminal code saying that ``not
only the direct perpetrator commits the punishable act, but also a
person who persuades another person to commit it, or who otherwise
contributes to its perpetration.''
   The historians' report concluded that Waldheim had concealed his
record as a German army lieutenant in the Balkans during World War
II. It also said he was in ``close proximity'' to some Nazi
atrocities, knew about them and did nothing to prevent them.
   Christian, asked for a reaction to the complaint, said only that
legal proceedings were constitutionally impossible.
   Under Article 63 of the Austrian constitution, a president can
be prosecuted only if both houses of Austria's parliament agree to
it.
   Waldheim has said the report exonerates him from accusations
linking him to war crimes, but the historians left open the
question of guilt.
   Waldheim has consistently denied any links with alleged war
crimes and has insisted he will stay in office despite increasing
pressure to resign. He was elected to a six-year term in June 1986,
three months after his service in the Balkans was first disclosed.
   The U.S. Justice Department has barred Waldheim from the United
States as an undesirable alien.
   The Israeli member of the historians' commission, Yehuda L.
Wallach, has said the report could serve as a basis for an
investigation of whether Waldheim could be prosecuted.
   The West German historian on the panel, Manfred Messerschmidt
said in an interview published Feb. 25 in the Munich daily
Sueddeutsche Zeitung that legal steps could be considered over
Waldheim's role in the fate of British commandos executed in Greece
in 1944.
   Last month, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ordered a
renewed investigation into that episode by British authorities.
   Parts of Messerschmidt's interview were quoted in the text of
the complaint against Waldheim.
   Messerschmidt said in connection with the 1944 episode, ``I
think that from the point of view of penal law, one could think
about whether this was not assistance'' in murder.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Gerhard Litzka said that, under
Austrian law, the state prosecutors' office is bound to examine
such a complaint and to deliver a recommendation to the Justice
Ministry on whether or not to open legal proceedings.

<HEAD>Iraq Continues Pounding Tehran With Missiles, Also Targets Qom</HEAD>

   Iraq said it pounded Tehran with
surface-to-surface missiles today for a third straight day and
fired two rockets at Iran's holy city of Qom, seat of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's religious hierarchy.
   Iran said it launched three long-range missiles against the
Iraqi capital of Baghdad early today in retaliation.
   One Iranian missile hit Baghdad at daybreak, killing or wounding
several civilians, including women and children, and destroying
houses, shops and cars, the official Iraqi News Agency said without
elaborating on the casualties.
   Iraq said it had sent 19 missiles into the Iranian capital since
Monday, including two today that Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency said wounded 15 civilians, among them eight women and
five children.
   Iraq's news agency reported a third missile was fired into
Tehran in the afternoon.
   Khomeini said Iran will not bow to pressure, and that missile
attacks ``make our nation stronger,'' Tehran Radio reported.
   It was the first time Iraq has used surface-to-surface missiles
on Tehran, a city of 6 million, since the Iran-Iraq war began in
September 1980. It marks the worst escalation of the 3-year-old
``war of the cities'' that has killed thousands of civilians.
   The attack on Qom was Iraq's first with surface-to-surface
missiles on the city 80 miles south of Tehran. The last time Iraqi
warplanes bombed Qom was January 1987.
   Iraq said the missiles used against Tehran were of its own
design and production, but Iran said they were Soviet-supplied.
   Western military analysts believe the Iraqis are using
Soviet-made Scud-B surface-to-surface missiles with ``strap-on''
booster rockets to give them extra range to reach Tehran, which is
290 miles from the Iraqi border. Qom is about the same distance
from the border.
   Iran also uses Scud-Bs to attack Baghdad, but has an advantage
because the Iraqi capital is only 80 miles from the border.
   The Iraqi News Agency said the missiles on Qom were fired just
before noon, but gave no other details of the attack on the city,
which it called ``the center of charlatans and hypocrites.''
   The agency reported a second attack on Qom in the early
afternoon.
   The Iranian news agency said no casualties were reported in the
strike on Qom before noon, but did not mention the later attack.
IRNA said 15 civilians suffered wounds in the latest attacks on
Tehran.
   Qom, a city of 250,000 people, is home to Iran's main
theological center and tomb of a Shiite Moslem saint. Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor, lives in
Qom.
   Although the city is Khomeini's seat, the 87-year-old supreme
leader of Iran's fundamentalist revolution lives in suburban
Tehran. He told families of war victims at his residence today:
``We fear nothing. For a martyrdom-lover it makes no difference to
be martyred by a missile, a bomb or anything else,'' Tehran Radio
reported.
   IRNA said Iranian artillery gunners, in retaliation for today's
attacks on Tehran, shelled military and economic installations in
the Iraqi cities of Basra, Ammara, Badra, Zorbatiya, Ali Sharqi and
Ali Gharbi.
   Iraq said it began the missile barrage of Tehran to retaliate
for two pre-dawn Iranian rockets on Baghdad on Monday. Iran said
the missiles were in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on the Tehran
oil refinery last week.
   The Iraqi and Iranian dispatches were monitored in Nicosia.

<TEXT>
   A water stoppage that took place about 30
minutes earlier than announced left a man with a burned scalp.
   At 7:30 a.m. Monday, Keith Dennis, of Ventnor, applied a caustic
hair relaxer to his scalp. Fifteen minutes later, he ducked his
head under the shower, only to discover there was no water.
   Dennis knew a new water main was being connected as part of a
road reconstruction, but residents had been notified that water
would be turned off about 8:15 a.m.
   Faced with a scalp that was beginning to burn, Dennis and his
wife, Melissa, first tried to bail some water out of the bottom of
the bathtub. Then they tried melting ice cubes on his head.
   ``It started burning more and more,'' Dennis said.
   Dennis considered rinsing his hair with any liquid in the
refrigerator, but was worried about chemical reactions, he said.
   He shouted for workers on the street to turn his water back on,
but said they laughed.
   The couple then called a poison hot line, asking for an
ambulance to bring water.
   But the message got garbled by the time it got to emergency
officials: ``The dispatcher said this guy had shampoo in his hair,
and could we send a bucket of water over,'' is how fire Capt. Bert
Sabo recalls it.
   An ambulance was deemed unnecessary. The Dennises wound up
driving to a hospital, where Dennis was treated for first-degree
burns.

   A spokesman says shrimpers will defy a
federal regulation requiring the use of devices designed to save
endangered sea turtles, despite a federal judge's decision to
enforce the regulation.
   To further complicate matters, Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries
agents are prohibited by state law from enforcing the federal
regulation requiring use of turtle excluder devices, which
shrimpers claim could ruin their business.
   Federal enforcement of the regulations began Tuesday after U.S.
District Judge Patrick Carr threw out a suit by shrimpers that
claimed that the devices cut down on their shrimp catches and
aren't effective.
   But Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is bound by
a state law forbidding enforcement of the federal law, said Phil
Bowman, assistant chief of the seafood division.
   ``We'll have to consult with legal counsel before we know what
to do,'' he said.
   Tee John Mialjevich, spokesman for Concerned Shrimpers of
Louisiana, vowed defiance despite Carr's ruling.
   ``I don't care if he upheld it. It's a bad law, and the
shrimpers ain't going to live by it,'' he said.
   The law also went into effect Tuesday in Texas, Mississippi and
Alabama waters, and has been in effect in Florida since Jan. 1.
Louisiana waters won't open to shrimping for two months, but big
boats work year-round in federal waters beyond the three-mile limit.
   Coast Guard patrols caught six shrimp boats working without the
devices since the law went into effect in Florida, Suzanne Montero
of the National Marine Fisheries Service said by telephone from St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   There were no reports of violations Tuesday, she said.
   The maximum civil penalty is $10,000, but first-time offenders
will probably be fined $5,000 to $7,500, she said.
   Under the law, most shrimpers will be required to use the
cage-like devices to save turtles protected under the Endangered
Species Act. The devices, which fit in shrimp nets, have slats to
force a trapped turtle out of a flap, but critics say they don't
always work that way.
   Critics said sometimes shrimp escape and debris gets caught in
the frame and ruins the net.
   Mialjevich said Florida shrimpers experienced catch reductions
of 35 percent to 50 percent.
   ``I'm telling you myself _ personally _ I'm not going to pull a
TED (turtle exclusion device), because I can't make a living. I'll
lose everything I've accumulated in 45 years. ... I can't take a 1
percent shrimp loss. How am I going to take a 35 percent loss?''
said Mialjevich.
   Carr had said in advance that his ruling would not determine the
effectiveness of the devices, but would address only whether the
government had followed proper procedures.

<HEAD>Social Democrat Chief Resigns In Kickback Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Social Democrats, one of five
parties in the government coalition, resigned after accusations
that he was involved in a kickback scandal.
   Franco Nicolazzi, 63, submitted his resignation as party
secretary on Monday to preserve party unity, he said. He denied
wrongdoing, saying ``these hands are clean.''
   The scandal involved millions of dollars allegedly paid to
prominent politicans by companies in exchange for prison
construction contracts. Nicolazzi is under investigation but hasn't
been charged.
   Nicolazzi was public works minister in several governments from
1980 through June. During his tenure, he helped pass a decree
authorizing $629 million for new prison construction.
   Pressure to resign built last week when Gabriele Di Palma, a
close associate of Nicolazzi and former head of the ministry's
public construction department, was detained by Swiss authorities
while allegedly trying to sneak into Switzerland.
   Nicolazzi was secretary of the Social Democrats since October
1985.
   The party received 3.4 percent of the vote in elections to the
Chamber of Deputies last June. Only the Liberals, with 2.1 percent,
had fewer votes among the five coalition parties. The others are
the dominant Christian Democrats, the Socialists and the
Republicans.
   Pier Luigi Romita, a senior Social Democrat deputy, is
considered the favorite to become the new leader of the party.

   Fire broke out today on the roof of the 26-floor
London Stock Exchange, but officials said it was quickly brought
under control and no one was injured.
   Police closed nearby streets and scores of spectators gathered
as smoke billowed from the skyscraper in London's financial
district.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said a few
people were evacuated from upper floors, but work continued
elsewhere in the building.
   The fire broke out in a cooling tower and appeared to have been
started by a workman's blowtorch igniting trash in the area, the
news agency said.
   The Stock Exchange said none of its financial services were
affected.
   Since the switch to computers on Oct. 27, 1986, most trading on
the London Stock Exchange has been done by telephone rather than on
the floor of the exchange.

   Police today searched more than
80 homes of suspected neo-Nazis and made some arrests in a
crackdown on extreme rightist groups, officials said.
   The searches were conducted in about 60 towns and cities across
the country, said police in the state of Baden-Wuerttemburg.
   A police official in Stuttgart, where federal authorities
coordinated the searches with state and local police, said there
had been ``some arrests,'' but he declined to be more specific.
   The official, citing department policy, spoke on condition he
not be identified.
   The searches apparently were carried out in conjunction with the
release from prison of Michael Kuehnen, a prominent neo-Nazi.
   Kuehnen was was freed today from Butzbach prison near Frankfurt
after completing a 3{-year sentence for distributing banned
right-wing extremist propaganda, a spokesman for the Frankfurt
Prosecutors office said.
   ``He was kept in prison up to the last minute possible,'' the
spokesman, Jochen Schroers, said in a telephone interview.
   Kuehnen, a former West German army lieutenant, headed an illegal
right-wing extremist group called ``Action Front of National
Socialists-National Activists.''
   The group was banned by the West German Interior Ministry on
Dec. 7, 1983 for advocating violence against leftists and
foreigners and for promoting Nazi ideology.

<TEXT>
   Assemblies of God leaders in Louisiana have
rejected a request by national church officials to toughen their
recommended sanctions against evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, a church
official says.
   Juleen Turnage, spokeswoman at church headquarters in
Springfield, Mo., said today that national church officers have not
been informed of any decision by the Louisiana district.
   The Louisiana official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday the 19-member state presbytery decided at a nine-hour
meeting Monday in Alexandria to resubmit its original
recommeendation that Swaggart be barred from preaching for three
months as part of a two-year program of rehabilitation.
   The official said it would now be up to national Assemblies of
God officials to decide whether to accept the state panel's
recommendation.
   The Assemblies' General Presbytery has a regular session
scheduled March 29, but an emergency session could be convened
sooner.
   Mrs. Turnage said at least three of the officers must attend any
meeting of the Executive Presbytery. She said it would be at least
Thursday before three of the officials will be back in Springfield.
   Mrs. Turnage said she talked by telephone Tuesday night with the
Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, the general superintendent of the church,
who said he believes it would be unprecedented for a state
presbytery to reject the national church's recommendations.
   Asked about reports last week from from friends of Swaggart that
he might leave the church if he feels the punishment is too harsh,
Mrs. Turnage said national officers have heard nothing directly
from Swaggart.
   ``We're not dealing with a radical or a rebel here. If he does
leave the church, it will be because his ministry can't survive
without him. It will be a pragmatic decision,'' she said.
   ``I think he is very committed to the church,'' Mrs. Turnage
said.
   The Louisiana Presbytery's original sanction was a two-year
rehabilitation program that also included counseling for Swaggart,
who heads a ministry that reportedly takes in $150 million a year.
   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21, telling the
congregation at his Baton Rouge worship center in a tearful
confession that he had sinned against his wife and God. Swaggart
reportedly paid a prostitute to pose nude for him and then tried to
make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it.
   The national presbytery reportedly recommended barring Swaggart
from the pulpit and television for a year, with an additional year
of regulation of his ministry afterward.
   A Louisiana Assemblies of God official contacted Tuesday night
by The Associated Press confirmed that the state panel stood by its
previous punishment for the evangelist. The decision originally was
reported by KATC-TV of Layfayette.
   When asked if Louisiana officials had sent back their original
censure to the church's national leaders, the source said, ``It
would be correct to say that.''
   Cecil Janway, the Assemblies of God district superintendent for
Louisiana, had said any actions made Monday by the state board
would not be made public.
   There was no indication whether Swaggart attended that meeting.
The Rev. Jim Rentz, who is substituting for Swaggart at his Family
Worship Center, did attend.
   Forrest Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana district
council, acknowledged Monday that national Assemblies of God
representatives also were at the meeting.

   Four sheriff's deputies today forcibly
evicted the last resident of The Lorraine Motel, where Martin
Luther King Jr. was assassinated 20 years ago.
   Jacqueline Smith, who has lived at the motel for 11 years,
refused to obey an eviction order, in protest of attempts to build
an $8.8 million museum at the site. She has said the project would
force poor people out of the neighborhood.
   King was shot by an assassin April 4, 1968, while in Memphis to
help organize a strike by sanitation workers.
   ``You people are making a mistake. You people are making a
mistake,'' Miss Smith said, sobbing, as four Shelby County deputies
carried her in a kneeling position from the balcony outside her
second-floor room to the sidewalk in front of the motel.
   ``I refuse to stand up,'' she said as the deputies walked away.
``I'm trying to help the people who live in this area. We're being
forced out. You people are wrong.''
   Miss Smith has been holed up at the motel since Jan. 11, when it
was closed by state officials directing the museum project.
   She ignored a state deadline Feb. 8 to move out and likened her
protest to civil rights battles staged by King.
   Before the deputies arrived, Miss Smith talked to reporters and
about 10 other spectators through an eight-foot chain link fence
that was put up around the site Jan. 11.
   ``My family is here and I have a home, but that's not what I
want,'' she said. ``If I can't live at The Lorraine, I'll camp out
on the sidewalk out front.''
   Randy Wade, an administrative assistant for the Shelby County
sheriff's office, said deputies used a tire iron to force open the
door to Miss Smith's room, just three doors down from the room
where King was killed.

<HEAD>FAA Will Require 10 Seats in New 747s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration will
require The Boeing Co. to install 10 exit doors in its new 747
passenger jetliners, rather than the eight the company prefers, the
agency's chief said today.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told a House subcommittee that
for safety reasons, he had decided to issue a final rule that would
require the additional doors and expected it to be ready by late
summer.
   A Boeing official, however, told the lawmakers that having eight
doors would be safe.
   ``Prudence,'' McArtor said when asked during a break in the
hearing about why he had made his decision. ``Just a concern of
safety.''
   Boeing plans to soon begin building a new line of the wide-body
747s, whose first generation went into service in 1970. The
aircraft, which can carry more than 500 passengers, are the most
frequently used jetliners for international travel and are also
commonly used for coast-to-coast flights within the United States.
   There are currently eight-exit versions of the 747s used by
foreign airlines, but they carry only 440 passengers.
   McArtor told the House Public Works investigations subcommittee
that the new rule would require a maximum of 60 feet between exit
doors for aircraft flown by U.S. airlines. This would, in effect,
require 10 doors in the 747s.
   In testimony prepared for delivery to the subcommittee, Boeing
Vice President Orvil M. Roetman contested McArtor's decision.
   ``Data, tests, in-service experience and analysis all show that
the 747 distances between exit doors, with either eight or 10 doors
on the main deck, are more than adequate for providing safe
evacuation,'' he said.

   A businessman was accused of diverting more
than $8,000 in surplus government food intended for school lunch
programs to his catering business and restaurants.
   Siinto Wessman, 70, was cited Tuesday in a criminal complaint in
state district court with two counts of fraud.
   From 1981 through June 1986, Wessman's catering firm, the Neal
Bort Co., had contracts with the Mountain Iron-Buhl, Biwabik and
Gilbert school districts to provide hot lunches under the federal
Child Nutrition Program.
   The contracts allowed the catering firm to obtain surplus
government commodites, including cheese, hamburger and butter, for
use in the school programs.
   The criminal complaint alleges Wessman diverted the food to two
restaurants, which have since closed, and to his catering business.
   ``The charges are absolutely false,'' Wessman said Tuesday. ``I
don't know anything about it.''
   The charges each carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and
a $20,000 fine.

   President Reagan, stepping up American
peace efforts in the Middle East, today directed Secretary of State
George P. Shultz to return to the region for further talks with
Arab and Israeli leaders.
   Reagan acted after receiving a report from Shultz on his four
days of diplomatic shuttling in the area and a critical session
Tuesday in London with King Hussein of Jordan.
   ``All countries in the region believe it is useful for the
United States to remain engaged in this process,'' Reagan said.
``We will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive
settlement.''
   Shultz will leave from Brussels after the windup of a NATO
summit meeting Thursday. He is expected to make stops in Israel,
Jordan and Egypt before returning to Washington next weekend.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, told reporters
earlier today, ``The President has said on a number of occasions
the United States wants a more visible role in the Middle East in
terms of trying to be helpful, that we were willing and eager to
participate in any way that could move the peace process forward.''
   The U.S. spokesman said Shultz was doing ``yeoman's work'' in
trying to promote negotiations.
   A U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Hussein had not
``thrown cold water'' on the U.S. initiative but also had not
endorsed it.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had a similar reaction.
   ``If I had to describe the situation, I would say that nobody
has signed up to our proposals, but everybody wants us to keep
working,'' Shultz said Tuesday in Tel Aviv.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, director-general of Shamir's office, said both
Jordan and Israel had asked Shultz to continue his mediation
effort, however.
   Shultz saw Reagan briefly Tuesday night on the president's
arrival from Washingtoon, but `they really didn't get a chance'' to
talk about the Middle East, Fitzwater said.
   ``We will see where it goes from here,'' the U.S. spokesman
said. ``There is no decision at this point.''
   Hussein is demanding an active Soviet role in peace talks and
participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization as he sole
representative of the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live under
Israeli control in the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Shamir, menawhile, refuses to deal with the PLO, which is
considered to be a terrorist group both by Israel and the United
States, and wants also to block participation by the Soviets, who
have backed Arab positions in the past and do not have diplomatic
relations with Israel.
   Shultz has made a point of emphasizing a need for U.S.
communications with the Palestinians, despite a ban on PLO
contacts. ``There's not a substitute for directly sitting down with
people,'' he said Tuesday. ``And that's in a sense what we've been
calling for all along.''

   The nation's largest dredging company will
plead guilty to a charge of rigging bids on Army Corps of
Engineers' dredging projects in the Gulf of Mexico in 1983-84, a
company officer confirmed today.
   Great Lakes dredging company of Oak Brook, Ill., will pay $4.26
million in fines as part of a plea bargain covering bid-rigging
charges filed Tuesday against the company in federal courts in New
Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Cleveland, said U.S.
Attorney John Volz.
   As part of the agreement, a subsidiary of Great Lakes, North
American Trailing Co., also will plead guilty in New Orleans to
1986 charges of bid-rigging and submitting false statements to the
government, Volz said.
   North American's charges relate to bids submitted on dredging
projects let for bid by the corps from 1982-84.
   ITEL Corp. acquired Great Lakes in 1985, and with it the legal
problems.
   Gary Hill, vice president for finances, said today that the plea
bargain is the final step in clearing up the problems.
   ``The company has been on a `good behavior' program, so to
speak, for over a year. That includes a lot of internal safeguards
to make sure that never happens again,'' Hill said from his
Illinois office. ``We set them up to establish ourselves once again
as a responsible contractor.''
   No company officials were named in the charges Tuesday, but at
least three have entered guilty pleas in the case over the last 18
months.

<HEAD>Tutu Says West Should Sever South Africa Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY GRAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said
today he would try to persuade Western governments to break all
diplomatic ties with South Africa until it eased restrictions on
anti-apartheid groups.
   ``We want to tell the South African government that they do not
deserve to be part of a decent society,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Tutu said Western nations should cut any diplomatic links with
South Africa and expel South African diplomats from their countries.
   ``Britain and America and West Germany have kept saying that
sanctions hurt blacks and sanctions are not effective,'' he said.
``While not withdrawing my support for economic sanctions, I am
saying to Britain, West Germany and other Western countries, `Here
is your chance.'''
   Tutu was in the Kenyan capital for a meeting of the All-African
Conference of Churches, which he heads.
   He said he has called in the past for Western governments to
break relations with Pretoria. But he said this time he intended to
actively campaign for such a move.
   ``My own intention now is to challenge the West to break off
diplomatic relations with South Africa, to expel South African
diplomats from their countries until certain conditions are met,''
the churchman said.
   Those conditions are a lifting of the state of emergency,
reversal of a Feb. 25 ruling that outlawed political activity by 18
opposition groups, and the release of political detainees,
especially children.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, and other churchmen
were arrested Monday when they attempted to march on the South
African Parliament at Cape Town to protest the crackdown on black
opposition groups.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, also was arrested. In an interview with ``CBS
This Morning'' from Harare, Zimbabwe, he said it is clear that the
government now is outlawing ``all legitimate peaceful activity,''
and that apartheid opponents have no choice but to resist.
   ``And if that means confrontation, if that means disobedience to
your unjust laws then I think that is exactly what we mean,'' he
said. ``We are talking about the possibility of civil
disobedience.''
   He said non-violent protests have ended in deaths in the past
but won't be a deterrent to civil disobedience.
   ``We will have to take the risks that go with it and we will
have to take the consequences that follow these actions of ours,''
he said.

<HEAD>Jailed IRA Member Selected Honorary Grand Marshal of St. Patrick's
Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish Republican Army member convicted of
killing a British Army officer has been selected honorary grand
marshal of Philadelphia's St. Patrick's Day Parade.
   After initially rejecting Joseph Patrick Thomas Doherty last
week, the board of the St. Patrick's Day Observance Association
reconsidered this week after some members ``vociferously voiced
their feelings,'' City Councilman and board member Francis W.
Rafferty said Tuesday.
   Thomas J. Gibson, this year's grand marshal and a charter member
of the St. Patrick's Day Association, and other board members had
questioned whether any honorary grand marshal should be selected
this year for the March 13 parade.
   ``I think it takes away from what the parade was organized
for,'' said Gibson, a Southwest Philadelphia tavern owner. ``It's a
religious parade, a Catholic religious parade ... and there's
nothing in there (the association constitution) that says we should
go in for these kinds of politics.''
   Doherty, 33, has been held in New York City's Metropolitan
Correctional Center since 1983 on charges he illegally entered the
country using a false passport after he escaped from a Belfast
prison.
   Requests by the British government to have Doherty extradited
have been rejected. He faces a life sentence in Northern Ireland.
   The U.S. attorney general began reviewing the case last year,
according to Doherty's attorney, Stephen Somerstein.
   Doherty has been named honorary grand marshal in St. Patrick's
Day parades in Hartford, Conn., and Bergen County, N.J., in past
years, said Somerstein. Irish Solidarity Day in New York was
dedicated to him last year, he said.
   Doherty's mother, Maureen, is expected to attend the parade,
according to Vincent Scully, Doherty's champion in the Irish
community and the state vice president of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians. Parade participants will be asked to wear yellow arm
bands to show their solidarity with Doherty, Scully said.
   ``We consider him a hostage,'' said Scully. ``I don't know him
and he doesn't know me, but I can't tolerate another Irishman
treated like dirt.''

<HEAD>Goetz To Inherit $140,550 From Father's Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City subway gunman Bernhard Goetz
Jr. will inherit $140,550 from his father's estate, but the sum
will hardly cover legal bills stemming from his 1984 shooting of
four teen-agers, a lawyer said.
   Besides four years worth of unpaid legal fees for the shooting
in a subway train, Goetz is being sued for $63 million by three of
the four black teen-agers he shot.
   The inheritance ``won't go very far in defending him on
anything,'' said Joseph Kelner, who has defended Goetz free of
charge in the civil cases.
   Kelner also said Tuesday that he planned to drop Goetz as a
client, saying Goetz has been ``uncooperative.''
   Goetz last October was sentenced to six months in jail and five
years probation for carrying an unlicensed gun, which he used to
shoot the young men. A jury acquitted him of more serious charges,
including attempted murder.
   He is free on $5,000 bond pending appeal.
   Goetz, his brother and two sisters are to share the $562,200.92
remaining in the estate of their father, Bernhard Willard Goetz Sr.
of Orlando, Orange County Probate Court records show.
   Goetz Sr., 78, died Sept. 4, 1984, the day Goetz paid $400 for
two 9mm pistols at Ken's Firearms Inc., giving his father's address
as his. Goetz's father had moved to Orlando in 1963 from Rhinebeck,
N.Y., where the family owned a dairy, a bookbinding company and
several real estate parcels.
   A lawyer for one of the shooting victims, James Ramseur,
welcomed news of Goetz's inheritance.
   ``I'm surprised,'' said Ron Kliegerman. ``His attorneys have
been telling us all along that he doesn't have a dime. Now we know
there's something there.''
   Ramseur's suit seeks $8.5 million, paraplegic Darrell Cabey is
suing Goetz for $50 million and Troy Canty has brought two suits
for $2.5 million _ one for negligent injury, the other for
intentional injury.
   ``The amount of time that will be involved in this case and
damages involved obviously will far exceed $150,000,'' Kliegerman
said.

<HEAD>Court Gives Cities Additional Protection From Lawsuits in Missouri
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave cities, at least
for now, additional protection from lawsuits that accuse
lower-ranking city officials of violating the rights of employees.
   By a 7-1 vote, the justices threw out a $15,000 award St. Louis
was ordered to pay James J. Praprotnik, a fired city architect.
   But the seven justices voting to overturn the award were sharply
split in their reasoning. Only four justices joined in the court's
main opinion, leaving open the possibility that a future case could
prompt a different result.
   Today's ruling, therefore, may leave local officials confused
over what standards apply in determining when cities can be held
legally responsible for violating individual rights.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the court's main opinion,
said cities may not be held liable unless those who claim their
rights were violated prove the ``existence of an unconstitutional
municipal policy.''
   She said Praprotnik cannot win his case by claiming that
high-ranking city officials _ such as the mayor and city aldermen _
failed to override decisions by subordinates who may have violated
Praprotnik's rights.
   ``Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one's
subordinates ... is not a delegation to them of the authority to
make policy,'' O'Connor said.
   Praprotnik was a manager in St. Louis' community development
agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his superiors over the
proposed installation by the city of a controversial sculpture.
   Praprotnik was suspended for 15 days but the city civil service
commission reinstated him with back pay.
   Then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency, the
heritage and urban design division, and his job responsibilities
were reduced. The transfer also meant a loss in seniority that
exposed him to being laid off.
   He was fired Dec. 30, 1983, a day after he was released from a
hospital where he had undergone surgery. The layoff cost him his
income, more than 500 hours of accumulated sick leave and other
pension and vacation benefits.
   City officials said he was fired for budgetary reasons.
   Praprotnik then sued under a federal civil rights law, charging
he was shunted to a dead-end job and then kicked out because of his
appeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in
1980.
   A jury awarded him $30,000. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reduced the amount to $15,000.
   The appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to support
Praprotnik's claim that he was fired for exercising his
constitutional rights.
   The appeals court said the city was liable, even though the jury
exonerated the individual officials sued by Praprotnik.
   O'Connor said the appeals court's ruling was too broad in
allowing the city to be sued based on decisions made by those who
lacked policy-making authority.
   Federal courts are not ``justified in assuming that municipal
policy-making authority lies somewhere other than where the
applicable (state) law purports to put it,'' she said.
   In Praprotnik's case, she said, that authority rests with the
mayor, the city aldermen and the civil service commission.
   The justices ordered further lower court hearings in the case to
determine whether Praprotnik still has a viable case.
   O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a separate opinion, said he was
worried that the court's main opinion embraces ``a theory of
municipal liability that is both unduly narrow and unrealistic and
one that ultimately would permit municipalities to insulate
themselves from liability for the acts of all but a small minority
of actual city policymakers.''
   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun.
   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, voting to uphold
Praprotnik's lower court victory. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who
only recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision.
   The case is St. Louis vs. Praprotnik, 86-772.

<TEXT>
   Conductor Henry Sopkin, who started with
100 high school musicians and gradually created the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra, has died. He was 84.
   Sopkin, who lived in Palo Alto for three years, died of heart
failure Tuesday after entering Stanford University Medical Center
last week.
   Before his retirement in 1966, he was musical director of the
symphony for two decades, overseeing more than 1,000 performances
and artists including Jascha Heifetz and Benny Goodman.
   A native of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, he studied
violin as a youth and entered the American Conservatory of Music in
Chicago, where he grew up, earning bachelor's and master's degrees
in music. In the 1920s and '30s, he taught at the conservatory, at
high schools and at Woodrow Wilson College before he was hired in
1944 to direct the Atlanta Youth Symphony Orchestra.
   With a budget of $5,000, he developed the youth symphony into an
adult professional organization with a $300,000 budget 21 years
later.
   After he retired, Sopkin was an instructor with the California
Institute for the Arts in the Los Angeles area, where he lived for
19 years before moving to Palo Alto.
   Sylvia, his wife of nearly 60 years, died in 1986. Survivors
include two sons, a brother, two sisters and a grandson.

   A ship carrying incinerator ash from
Philadelphia won't be allowed to return to tie up here until there
is an agreement about cleaning up 2,000 to 4,000 tons of ash
reportedly left in Haiti, a lawyer says.
   Bruce Phillips, attorney for Joseph Paolino & Sons Inc., which
has a contract with the city to dispose of the ash, said the Khian
Sea would be allowed to dock at Paolino's pier only after there is
an agreement on cleaning up the ash in Gonaives, Haiti.
   ``We want an enforceable covenant that the material will be
removed from Haiti or disposed of in an environmentally sound
manner,'' Phillips said.
   Robert Cordes, president of the ship's operator, Amalgamated
Shipping Co. of Freeport, Bahamas, declined to comment when reached
at his office by The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Phillips said Paolino will not be paid unless it can show the
ash has been disposed of legally.
   The ship had been turned away from six countries while wandering
the Caribbean and the Atlantic seeking a dumping spot. It anchored
at the mouth of Delaware Bay, north of Lewes, Del., on Tuesday.
   In addition to the question about the ash in Haiti, the ship's
80-mile voyage up the Delaware River to Philadelphia was delayed by
inspections and a pier fire.
   The Coast Guard refused to allow the ship to proceed until it
passed an inpsection by the American Bureau of Shipping.
   The Coast Guard said this morning that the ship passed an
inspection conducted Tuesday, and that the captain of the port has
determined the ship is ``safe to transit U.S. waters,'' the coast
guard said.
   No time was set for the Khian Sea to travel upriver. Its radar
system still didn't work and the coast guard said the ship is
restricted to daytime traveling.
   The environmental group Greenpeace has labeled the Khian Sea's
cargo toxic. State tests conducted when the ash was loaded found no
dangerous levels of toxins, and recent federal tests from the same
incinerator came to the same conclusions.
   The Fire Department, meanwhile, is investigating a rubbish fire
at the Paolini pier this morning. The fire damaged a transfer
station, a company official said.
   Coast Guard spokesman Scott Miller said the city will appoint an
independent engineering firm to determine the safety of the pier
and whether the Khian Sea will be able to dock there.
   Paolino is expected to send the residue to an Ohio landfill,
where the bulk of the city's ash has been dumped for the past two
years, said Phillips.

<HEAD>Rosalynn Carter Urges New Mental Health Spending as House
Considers Bill</HEAD>

   Former first lady Rosalynn Carter said
Wednesday that mental illness was America's No. 1 health problem as
a House panel opened hearings on a plan to increase spending on
care and services for mentally ill senior citizens.
   The ``Elderly Mental Health Initiative'' advanced by Rep. Edward
Roybal, D-Calif., would increase outlays for community-based
services for the elderly and their families, on research into
prevention, treatment and services, and on training for health care
professionals.
   It also would lift the lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric
care paid by Medicare and expand Medicare to cover more outpatient
and community-based mental health services. And it would require
Medicaid to cover community-based services as well.
   In addition, the Roybal bill would create a consumer bill of
rights and set up a national mental health education program.
   ``Now is the time for federal action,'' Roybal said in opening a
hearing on the subject. ``For far too long, mental health care has
been a neglected priority.''
   The Roybal bill would authorize $161 million in new spending in
its first year, most of it to expand mental health grants to
states. The money does not include added expenditures under the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, for which Roybal did not provide an
estimate.
   According to a report compiled by Roybal's House Select
Committee on Aging, between 15 percent and 25 percent of Americans
over 65, about 7 million people, have significant mental health
problems. Very few receive appropriate care, the report said.
   Mrs. Carter and Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste told Roybal's
committee the federal government needs to pay more attention to
mental health needs and spend more on them.
   She called mental health ``America's No. 1 health problem.'' She
recommended substantially higher spending channeled through states,
improvements in Medicare and Medicaid coverage, and strengthening
of patient advocacy services such as the nursing home ombudsman
program.
   ``One of my most urgent pleas is for adequate insurance coverage
for mental illnesses,'' Mrs. Carter said. ``I think the Congress
should do everything possible to assure this coverage. It is is
another of our sadly neglected needs.''
   Celeste stressed the need for community-based services for the
elderly and the relatives who take care of them.
   ``It is a family and community issue. It impacts on all of us at
one time or another,'' he said. ``Many of us here today know
firsthand the responsibility of caring for an elderly family
member.''
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., said more than 25 percent of all
suicides are committed by the elderly, ``indicating in many cases
the desperation that they feel.'' He also said more than half the
patients in nursing homes have Alzheimer's disease.

   It might have sounded corny if said by
someone else, someplace else. But this was Elizabeth Dole, and the
praise of her presidential candidate husband struck a pleasing
chord with her fellow North Carolinians.
   ``He kind of reminds me of a laser beam,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``I'm
in awe of the way he can cut through the complexities of a tough
issue and come up with an answer.''
   The crowd responded with applause and approving smiles.
   Standing atop a platform in the parking lot of a suburban office
complex, the former transportation secretary spoke with feeling
about the decision she had made days before to relinquish her
Cabinet post and become a full-time campaigner.
   ``This is where my roots are,'' said the one-time debutante and
beauty queen from Salisbury, N.C. ``This is home. This is where I
draw my strength.''
   George Bush boasts a superior organization and Pat Robertson has
his ``invisible army,'' but Bob Dole has had his own not-so-secret
weapon in the battle for Southern votes next week on Super Tuesday.
   The weapon, he says, is Elizabeth Dole _ known as Liddy _ whose
old-South charm and Ivy League credentials propelled her from
small-town North Carolina to the Reagan Cabinet. She has shown a
talent for holding crowds in the palm of her hand.
   ``She's a vivacious, bright, enthusiastic campaigner,'' said
Haley Barbour, a Mississippi consultant and former political
adviser in the Reagan White House. ``I think other Southerners will
feel a kinship to her.''
   Mrs. Dole agreed last fall to step down as transportation
secretary and hit the campaign trail, making what she said was one
of the toughest decisions of her life. Some feminists complained,
saying she had squandered on opportunity to debunk the traditional
image of the candidate's wife.
   But Mrs. Dole, 51, said there was nothing demeaning about her
change of course.
   ``I mean, this is a challenging assignment to be discussing
national and international issues with the press and the public,''
she said then. ``I will be lucky if I get to see Bob very much at
all. It is not just standing at his side and smiling.''
   She spent the fall crisscrossing the South, speaking at rallies,
giving interviews, lining up commitments among GOP activists and
raising money for the Kansas senator.
   Observers say the final vote counts on Tuesday may well show
Vice President Bush, not Senate Republican Leader Dole, the big
winner in the South. But that wouldn't mean Mrs. Dole failed, they
say.
   ``She's a charmer, but there's only so much you can do,'' said
Ted Arrington, a Republican activist and political scientist at the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
   Tim Archie, the Dole campaign's deputy press secretary, said,
``She laid the groundwork for our presence in the South. She
represents the region, can pull in a crowd, and her experience in
the administration is useful.''
   She's also been credited with helping Dole change the image as a
slashing campaigner acquired in his 1976 quest for the vice
presidency. She speaks of his compassion and courage, qualities she
says are most evident close-up.
   Campaign strategists considered Mrs. Dole's vote-getting
potential important enough to hustle her to Iowa in the weeks
leading up to that state's caucuses _ which Dole won.
   Mrs. Dole grew up in a small, conservative town in the North
Carolina Piedmont, the only daughter of well-to-do parents. She was
a debutante at age 18 and two years later was student body
president of the Women's College at Duke University. She graduated
from Harvard Law School and went to Washington, where she spent two
decades in various government posts including the Federal Trade
Commission.
   In 1976, shortly after her marriage to Dole, she took a leave of
absence to help him run for vice president. In 1979, she quit the
FTC to join Dole's presidential campaign.

   Israeli troops hunting for
Arab protesters today fired tear gas into the reception area of a
hospital emergency room, driving out dozens of elderly patients,
doctors said.
   Palestinians hurled firebombs and troops fired tear gas in
scattered clashes throughout the night in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, where violent protests have occurred daily since
Dec. 8.
   Violence erupted for the second consecutive day at the
government-run Ramallah Hospital about eight miles north of
Jersusalem, the latest in a recent series of intense clashes at
medical facilities in the occupied territories.
   About a dozen Israeli troops outside the hospital compound were
confronted by rock-hurling Palestinian protesters who blocked a
nearby street. One smoking canister landed in the reception area of
the emergency room and another landed in a hospital courtyard,
doctors said.
   Two physicians donned gas masks and others held onions to their
noses to blunt the effects of the tear gas, one doctor said. About
30 patients, including elderly people, were driven outside.
   ``Even the doctors couldn't breathe, so imagine the effects on
the patients inside, many of whom are seriously ill,'' said a
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Arab doctors say injured Palestinians often are reluctant to
come to hospitals for fear of being arrested by Israeli authorities
while under treatment.
   But hospitals also have often become refuges for Arab
demonstrators fleeing arrest after violent confrontations with
soldiers.
   Soldiers detained three youths outside the hospital, including
one with a gash on his forehead and bleeding from the shoulder. He
was seen being dragged by a soldier.
   On Tuesday, three soldiers had burst into the same hospital,
fired tear gas and rubber bullets and struck two doctors with their
rifles as they looked for demonstrators, doctors there said.
   An army spokesman denied soldiers entered the hospital or beat
doctors. He said soldiers detained two Palestinians, but that the
youths were taken into custody at the entrance to the hospital.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, officials at the Shifa Hospital said
Israeli sodliers entered the facility overnight and arrested two
Arab demonstrators accused by Israel of trying to run over a
soldier with their car.
   At least 76 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by Israeli
gunfire, and hundreds wounded since Dec. 8 in the territories
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Also today, three Italian legislators chained themselves to
electric poles near Ramallah to protest the Israeli crackdown. One
legislator held a sign saying: ``Stop the Killing _ Yes, To
Palestinian Self-Determination.''
   Israel's right- and left-wing politicians disagreed today about
the future of Secretary of State George P. Shultz's peace
initiative after hearing reports of his meeting Tuesday with
Jordan's King Hussein in London.
   Shultz had just finished a four-day diplomatic shuttle in the
Middle East trying to gain acceptance of a formula for talks to
deal with Palestinian unrest in the occupied lands and an overall
Arab-Israeli settlement.
   Likud legislator Dan Meridor, a close aide to right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, today said Israel ``was unhappy because of
the positions we are hearing from Jordan'' following talks between
Hussein and Shultz in London.
   ``King Hussein says the PLO must be involved in the peace
process and he wants a full-scale international conference,''
Meridor said on Israel Television. ``If that's progress, I don't
know what going backwards is.''
   But former Foreign Minister Abba Eban, a legislator from the
centrist Labor Party, said the differences between Jordan and
Israel could be bridged.

<HEAD>Police: Deaf Man Clubbed In Case Of Mistaken Identity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deaf man mistaken for an auto theft suspect
was clubbed with a nightstick, sparking complaints from his sister
and an internal police investigation.
   ``We made a mistake, no doubt about it. I don't know what went
wrong,'' police spokesman Steve Cole said Tuesday. ``Sometimes in
the heat of trying to catch somebody, it's going to happen and it's
unfortunate that it did.
   ``I think (the officer's) main concern was he thought he had
somebody that was going to get away from him,'' Cole said.
   Jeffery Johnson, 21, suffered shoulder bruises Monday night.
   ``The main thing is he doesn't understand why he was struck. He
keeps asking why,'' said his sister, Betty Matthews, who shares her
home with Johnson. She filed a complaint with police.
   The incident began when Officer Delier Diaz gave chase to a car
that had refused to pull over. The chase led to an apartment
complex, where the car's two occupants parked the vehicle and fled.
   Johnson had just helped two maintenance workers at the complex
free a tractor from a ditch when Diaz arrived.
   The officer approached Johnson, who raised his hand to his ear _
the signal used by the deaf to indicate they can't hear. Diaz
ordered him to the ground, said apartment resident Elizabeth Borreo.
   ``Jeff put up his hand and the cop just started hitting him,''
Mrs. Borreo said. ``He hit him with his stick on the leg. Jeff bent
down to grab his leg, and he hit him again on the left shoulder.
Then the cop pushed him down.''
   She and her husband said Diaz held Johnson's hands behind his
back while another officer handcuffed him and put him in a patrol
car.
   ``I said, `You got the wrong guy. He lives here and I saw him
not five minutes ago,''' apartment manager Iris Cox said. Within 30
minutes, the officers released Johnson.
   Later Monday, two people were arrested on charges of grand theft
auto and resisting arrest without violence.
   After those arrests, Diaz filed a report saying he mistakenly
tried to apprenhend Johnson, who he thought was ignored his order
to lay down.

<TEXT>
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
says his family is paying for a huge new basilica whose
construction has attracted attention during the West African
nation's economic crisis.
   Houphouet-Boigny told a visiting French boy's choir the
government would never pay for construction of a church building
because the nation was made up of many religious faiths.
   The government daily Fraternite Matin on Wednesday quoted the
president as saying that ``on the streets, some people are amusing
themselves by saying the basilica is financed by the Ivorian
government.''
   ``It will be a gift from my family to the Holy See,''
Houphouet-Boigny said.
   The basilica, which will be the second-largest in the world,
will be built on land donated by Houphouet-Boigny to the state in
his native Yamoussoukro, Fraternite Matin said.
   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to open the church Sept. 10,
1989. It will have 120 arches and a row of columns about 275 yards
long. Figures on its cost have not been released.
   The Ivory Coast has a budget shortfall of more than $600
million, and last year it suspended payments on its international
debt.

   Thieves stole five rare paintings from
the hometown mansion of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, police
said Wednesday.
   Benjamin Guittab, caretaker of the house in Batac, northern
Luzon, said he noticed while cleaning on Wednesday that only the
frames remained.
   The burglars apparently climbed a tree and crawled in an open
window of a second-floor bedroom during the weekend, police said.
There were no suspects.
   The 4-foot-by-6-foot paintings by 19th century painter Juan
Luna, a national hero, had adorned the Marcoses' living room.
Antique collectors and the curator of the Luna shrine near here say
the works are priceless.
   Batac Mayor Jesus Nalupta said he visited Marcos early this year
in Honolulu and the former president asked him to look after the
house. Marcos fled to exile in Hawaii following a popular revolt in
February 1986 that ended his 20-year authoritarian rule.
   Nalupta placed the mansion under tight security Wednesday.

   Leaders of the Western alliance today
endorsed President Reagan's efforts to negotiate new reductions in
nuclear arms and demanded sweeping cutbacks in the Soviet Union's
vastly superior conventional forces in Europe to rule out a
surprise attack.
   Within hours of opening their first summit talks in six years,
Reagan and leaders of 15 other NATO nations declared that Soviet
conventional forces ``cast a shadow over the whole of Europe'' and
must be reduced sharply to ease the imbalance in East-West military
strength.
   These proposed cutbacks, they said, ``will entail, for example,
the elimination from Europe of tens of thousands of Warsaw Pact
weapons relevant to surprise attack, among them tanks and artillery
pieces.''
   The overall aim of the talks was to demonstrate allied unity in
advance of Reagan's planned Moscow summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in late May or June. But there were
nagging differences among the NATO leaders over other nuclear arms
issues.
   Reagan, his voice hoarse and rasping from allergies, summoned
reporters to the steps of his 19th century palace residence, the
Chateau Stuyvenberg, to read his own statement on the NATO
declaration. The president called the massive Soviet conventional
forces ``the most direct threat to our security and to stability in
Europe.''
   He added: ``But arms reductions are not enough. ... We also look
for greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on
which lasting security and stability in Europe ultimately depend.''
   Reagan seemed undisturbed by frictions among NATO leaders about
the future of the U.S.-supplied force of short-range nuclear
weapons, most of them based in West Germany.
   ``I have never seen such harmony as we have,'' the president
said. He called the statement on European conventional forces ``a
major step'' forward for the allies.
   Reagan also announced he was sending Secretary of State George
Shultz back to the Middle East after the NATO summit ends Thursday
to press his talks with Arab and Israeli leaders.
   ``All countries in the region believe it is useful for the
United States to remain engaged in this process,'' Reagan said.
``We will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive peace
settlement.''
   At the opening summit session earlier today, Reagan sat next to
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and listened intently as
NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington pledged the allies' ``full
support'' for Reagan's drive to reach agreement with the Soviets on
drastic cuts in strategic nuclear weapons.
   But, Carrington declared, ``the alliance will not rest on its
laurels.''
   In a six-page statement on conventional forces, the NATO leaders
said:
   ``The Soviet Union's military presence in Europe, at a level far
in excess of its needs for self-defense, directly challenges our
security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation
in Europe.
   ``Thus, the conventional imbalance in Europe remains at the core
of Europe's security concerns.''
   The allied leaders spelled out demands for far bigger cutbacks
in Soviet conventional forces than in the West's military levels,
during negotiations to begin in earnest this fall in Vienna,
Austria, with representatives of the Warsaw Pact consisting of the
Soviet Union and six East European allies.
   ``Our aim will be to establish a situation in Europe in which
force postures as well as the numbers of deployments and weapons
systems no longer make surprise attack and large-scale offensive
action a feasible option,'' the NATO statement said.
   Carrington said the alliance leaders had gathered to celebrate
the new U.S.-Soviet ban on edium-range missiles, and for ``charting
the way ahead'' as Gorbachev pursues a peace offensive.
   ``One agreement which reduces some weapons, and indeed one new
Soviet leader who is ready to reduce some tensions, however
significant, do not in themselves remove the military capability
and potential of the Soviet Union,'' Carrington said.
   He added that NATO's ``collective determination to deploy and
maintain a military capacity where necessary were what convinced
the Soviet Union of the better route of arms control and
disarmament.''
   ``We wish President Reagan and his negotiators well in the
effort to secure an agreement on strategic arms reduction, which
has the alliance's full support,'' Carrington said.
   Reagan was the last of the leaders to arrive at sprawling NATO
headquarters today for the opening session of two days of summit
talks that are expected to stress alliance unity despite
differences over nuclear arms strategy.
   At the first closed meeting, Reagan reportedly underlined the
U.S. commitment to Europe and urged his fellow leaders to guard
against Soviet attempts to divide the Western alliance.
   It was West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl who touched on a
simmering dispute over whether NATO members should quickly improve
their stocks of short-range nuclear missiles, most of which are
deployed in West Germany.
   ``The load, the risks and the responsibilities of our defense
must be equally shared by all members,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl's remarks, made public by Bonn officials, alluded to the
fundamental issue of how the alliance can fill the gap left by the
Reagan-Gorbachev agreement last December to eliminate
ground-launched, intermediate-range nuclear misiles from Europe.
   Senior NATO officials drafting a final communique to be
published Thursday sought to bridge differences ranging from West
Germany's reluctance to Britain's enthusiasm for a swift decision
on modernization to internal divisions over the issue within the
French government.
   Looking toward Soviet-American arms talks, Carrington said an
improved Soviet human rights record was fundamental to creating
``the confidence necessary to proceed with a radical arms control
agenda.''
   He added: ``For most of us in the West that cause (of tension)
is the degree of mistrust created by the denial of basic human
rights and freedom to the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.''
   Carrington reaffirmed NATO's commitment supporting a proposed
superpower agreement to reduce long-range nuclear weaponry by 50
percent on both sides. He said NATO also looked forward to ``a more
serious engagement'' with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on a chemical
weapons ban and reducing the Eastern bloc's superiority in
conventional arms.
   As the meeting began, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
reported that ``progress is fine'' on drafting a statement of
common alliance goals to be issued at the conclusion of the two-day
summit.
   Reagan, who reached Brussels coughing and complaining of
allergies, ws to spend 2 1-2 hours conferring with the 15 other
heads of state or government. When he arrived Tuesday, the
president tried to allay concerns over the Warsaw Pact's advantage
in conventional forces by promising to keep U.S. troops in Europe
``as long as Europeans want them to stay.''

   Police arrested people involved in ethnic rioting
in a southern republic, the official media said today, and the
government acknowledged that others may have been killed during the
massive unrest.
   A radio station and newspaper in Baku, the capital of
Azerbaidzhan, reported also that the republic's premier, Gasan N.
Seidov, had traveled to the affected area.
   ``The unrest has been stopped. Businesses and establishments of
trade and public eating are working in a normal rhythm and classes
are taking place in schools and other educational establishments,''
the Baku Worker newspaper reported.
   The newspaper's article, referring to the Azerbaidzhan city of
Sumgait, was read to The Associated Press by Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   ``Order and peace have been ensured by law enforcement organs.
People caught in the unrest have been detained,'' the Baku Worker
newspaper reported.
   Gerasimov said in a telephone interview that he could not
confirm rumors circulated by Armenian activists that as many as 20
people had been killed in Sumgait. But he added, ``There was
hooliganism and there can be deaths in such cases.''
   On Tuesday, Gerasimov told a news briefing that authorities
clamped a curfew on Sumgait. He suggested the unrest in Sumgait,
and demonstrations and violence elsewhere in the Caucasus region in
which at least two people died, were due to a ``mistake'' made 65
years ago when a territory composed largely of Armenians was made
part of neighboring Azerbaidzhan.
   He said ``there were certain injuries'' in Sumgait, an
industrial city of more than 160,000 people in Azerbaidzhan where
hooligans were blamed for touching off the Sunday riot.
   ``The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,''
Gerasimov said at the Tuesday briefing.
   Moscow-based foreign journalists have been barred from the
region, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and the
official media have reached the Soviet capital. Most telephone
calls placed to Baku and Sumgait today did not go through.
   A man answering the telephone at the Ministry of Internal
Affairs in Baku said ``everything is over'' when asked about the
unrest in Sumgait. The conversation was cut off before a reporter
could ask the person's name and position.
   Baku Radio, monitored by the London-based British Broadcasting
Corp., reported today that two non-voting members of the national
ruling Politburo, Georgy P. Razumovsky and Pyotr N. Demichev, had
visited businesses and other establishments in Baku to speak to the
``working people of these multinational collectives.''
   It did not say when the tour occurred or say whether the two
officials also went to Sumgait. They had visited the Armenian
capital, Yerevan, last week during demonstrations there.
   Asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling the streets
of Sumgait, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians in the
streets and that there have been at least two deaths in the city,
Gerasimov told the briefing,``There is a curfew,'' but that he had
not heard anything about tanks being sent into the city.
   Asked if troops remained in the city Tuesday, Gerasimov said:
``I don't know, but I guess so. Presumably.''
   The violence in Sumgait, reported Monday by Tass, the official
Soviet news agency, followed earlier outbreaks 150 miles away in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the contested region in Azerbaidzhan, and massive
but apparently peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan, the capital of
Armenia.
   Hovik Vassilian said in a telephone interview today that he and
other Armenian activists were angry that the official media
reported that the unrest had been quelled. He said he heard from
travelers and from telephone calls to residents of the region that
demonstrations were continuing in Nagorno-Karabakh and that food
was in short supply.
   The demonstrators demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh, part of
Azerbaidzhan since 1923, be made part of Armenia. More than
three-quarters of the region's population of 157,000 are ethnic
Armenians.
   On Saturday, a Soviet prosecutor reported that two people living
in a region of Azerbaidzhan that borders on Nagorno-Karabakh had
been slain in unrest caused by the territorial dispute.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for
restraint in Azerbaidzhan and Armenia and promised that the
Communist Party Central Committee would review relations among the
Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   Predominantly Moslem Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet
republics in the Caucasus. It is bordered on the west by largely
Christian Armenia and Georgia and on the north by the Russian
Republic. The Caspian Sea runs for nearly 800 miles along its
eastern edge.

   A federal safety agency filed a civil
complaint Wednesday seeking to force the recall of a device
intended to help fishermen collect worms, but which it says could
wind up electrocuting the anglers instead.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said it wants to halt
sales of the WORM GETT'R made by P&M Enterprises of Caldwell, Idaho.
   Directory information showed no listing for P&M Enterprises in
Caldwell.
   The device uses metal probes on wooden handles and is tied
together by an electric wire, the commission said. When the probes
are inserted into the ground, electric current passed through the
wire drives worms to the surface.
   But the commission said the design exposes users to the bare
metal charged with electricity and thus could lead to a dangerous
shock.
   No injuries have been reported involving the device, but there
have been 23 deaths since 1971 involving other brands of similarly
designed worm probes, the agency reported.
   About 30,000 WORM GETT'R devices were sold nationally over the
past five years at prices ranging from $8 to $30, the commission
said.
   The commission asked that consumers who have been injured, or
know of others who have had mishaps involving any type of worm
probe, to call it at 1-800-638-2772.

   A man armed with two guns leaped out
of a taxicab and opened fire on a crowded street today, wounding
four people before being shot moments later, police said.
   Witnesses said the gunman got out of a taxicab after arguing
with the driver of another vehicle and began firing repeatedly
about a half-block from the Hyatt Regency Hotel, which is about
five blocks from the Alamo.
   ``I saw there was a confrontation with the man in another
vehicle. He pulled out a gun and started firing,'' said Tod Tarble,
20, who witnessed the 9 a.m. incident from a bus stop about 90 feet
away.
   ``There were people all around the street who were trying to get
up there when everybody was being shot, but I tried to keep them
back,'' he said.
   A 55-year-old man believed to be the gunman was being treated at
Medical Center Hospital for a gunshot wound to his left thigh,
spokeswoman Inez Eisazadeh said. His condition was not known, she
said.
   Another victim was being treated at Medical Center Hospital for
a wound to her right knee, and another was treated at Brooke Army
Medical Center for multiple gunshot wounds. A third was taken to
Baptist Memorial Hospital with a leg wound, and the fourth to Nix
Hospital, also with a leg wound.
   After the initial shots, the gunman ``heard the sirens and began
running. A downtown foot patrolman and a park ranger confronted
him,'' police Sgt. Paul Buske said.
   ``The man apparently was out of shells in one of his guns, and
was trying to reload while attempting to shoot with the other
one,'' he said. ``The officers returned fire, and the man was
struck in the upper leg.''
   Buske said he didn't know whether bullets from the officers'
guns or from the gunman's struck the man.
   Tarble said that when the gunman, who was a passenger in the
taxi, began firing, the taxi driver and the driver with whom the
gunman had argued both tried run away.
   The gunman got out of the car, shot a passer-by in the leg,
fired two shots at a woman trying to hunker down in her car's front
seat and fired again at a passing station wagon, hitting the driver.
   He then went around a corner, shot at another person and was
then felled by gunfire, Buske said.

<TEXT>
   Doctors stopped treating patients and
industry and construction halted today as a strike protesting the
rule of Gen. Manuel Noreiga picked up support despite a violent
crackdown on Tuesday.
   Most stores in the downtown commercial zone were open, but many
outside the area closed.
   In Washington, a lawyer for a Panamanian opposition group said
the State Department was preparing to notify all U.S. banks where
the Panamanian government has deposits not to engage in any
transactions with the regime that seized power last week.
   William D. Rogers said the State Department action would require
the banks to make payments only to the ambassador who represented
the deposed government of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. The State
Department did not immediately confirm Rogers' statement.
   On Tuesday, security agents armed with shotguns ransacked a
radio station that defied censors by broadcasting news and backing
the strike. A former presidential candidate also was roughed up.
   The raid by a score of state security agents shattered the
uneasy calm that had marked the organized protest strike that began
Monday to seek the ouster of Noriega, Panama's military strongman.
   ``The station was totally destroyed,'' said the owner, Carlos
Ivan Zuniga, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984. ``It
will return to the air when there is democracy in Panama.''
   Many doctors appeared to have joined the strike today. Most of
the main hospitals were staffing only their emergency rooms, a
check of major hospitals and clinics showed.
   Zuniga was seen being arrested with his son, Carlos, and two
other people.
   Security agents pulled Zuniga by the hair, forced his head down
and shoved him hard into a vehicle. His shirt was almost torn off
as he struggled against the agents.
   The car was blocked by another vehicle and Zuniga, a
white-haired man of about 60, fled down the street with his torn
shirt fluttering and security men in pursuit.
   He was captured and later released and said he was unhurt. The
other three were kicked, punched and beaten with truncheons.
   At least three people were wounded by birdshot, none seriously.
   Security agents confiscated the exposed film of several news
photographers, including the Tampa Tribune's Allyn DiVito, who had
a pistol held to his head until he surrendered his film.
   At a news conference following his release, Zuniga called the
attack an ``act of official state gangsterism.'' He estimated
damage to his station, Radio Mundial, at $100,000. The station is
also known as Radio 10-FM.
   Shortly before the attack, Zuniga said, the station broadcast an
appeal to residents of the capital to demonstrate peacefully
against the government by waving white hankerchiefs, honking their
car horns and banging on pots and pans each day at noon and 6 p.m.
   That was in defiance of government censors' orders that the
station only play music.
   About 15 people were handing out anti-government leaflets
outside the station when the security agents arrived suddenly in
four four-wheel drive vehicles with darkly tinted windows.
   The agents bolted from the vehicles, firing shotguns and
revolvers in the air, quickly dispersed the leaflet distributors
and charged into the station, smashing equipment and furniture.
   The station is housed in the offices of the Popular Action
Party, which Zuniga heads, and is in a middle-class neighborhood.
At the first sounds of gunfire, about 150 neighbors poured into the
street, many of them waving white banners and taunting the agents.
   Young men threw rocks at the security men and set up barricades
of burning trash on the street outside the station and several
sidestreets. Order was not restored for several hours.
   As word of the attack on Radio Mundial spread, barricades went
up on streets elsewhere in the city, but there was no further
violence.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade, a wide coalition of
business, professional, labor and political groups that organized
the nationwide strike, claimed Tuesday night that the action halted
85 percent of the country's economic activity.
   Crusade leaders said they would meet today to decide whether to
continue the action.
   After Noriega's former second-in-command went public last June
with charges the general was involved in vote fraud, corruption and
political assassination, the Crusade organized several large
demonstrations.
   Noriega, chief of Panama's 17,000-member Defense Forces, sent
troops into the streets with guns, billy clubs and tear gas to
break up last summer's protests. Three people were killed and
scores injured.
   Crusade leaders deny their goal is to restore Delvalle to the
presidency. National Assembly ousted Delvalle on Friday for trying
to fire Noriega.
   Noriega, who has run the country since 1983, was indicted in the
United States last month for trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
Delvalle had said last Thursday that the general should step down
while the charges were investigated.
   Until he tried to fire Noriega, Delvalle was widely seen as the
general's puppet. The Reagan administration says it still
recognizes Delvalle's presidency.
   Hours after he was dismissed, Delvalle went into hiding. He has
not been seen publicly, but has issued statements calling for an
international trade embargo against Panama to stop the cash flow.

<TEXT>
   An extreme right-wing party
opposing all concessions to blacks was favored today as voters
began the process of filling two vacant seats in the white chamber
of Parliament.
   The Conservative Party was expected to win the seats in the
districts of Standerton and Schweizer-Reneke, despite an aggressive
campaign waged by President P.W. Botha's governing National Party.
   The turnout was expected to exceed 70 percent in both districts.
More than 15,000 people were eligible to vote in Schweizer-Reneke
and more than 22,000 in Standerton.
   The Conservative Party seeks to reinstate all rescinded
apartheid laws and charges that Botha is capitulating to the
country's 26 million black majority through his limited reforms in
recent years.
   The Conservatives have been gaining ground in Standerton and
Schweizer-Reneke, rural districts in Transvaal province, at the
expense of the National Party. In Parliament's white chamber, the
National Party has firm control with 133 seats to 20 for the
Conservatives.
   In last May's whites-only general election, the Conservative
Party captured both the Standerton and Schweizer-Reneke seats, but
they became vacant when the incumbents resigned.
   This by-election campaign illustrates the degree to which white
politics has become a struggle on the right. The anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party did not field candidates and demands of
black activists and foreign critics are dismissed as irrelevant.
   ``The choice is between bad and worse,'' said Business Day, the
leading financial daily. ``It may be an appalling thought, but the
growing power of the extreme right is so serious a threat that we
believe the Conservative Party has to be opposed at every turn,
even if it means voting for Nationalists.''
   The Star of Johannesburg described Schweizer-Reneke as an area
``where blacks are seen and not heard. When they are seen it is
largely in terms of service to whites.''
   Both parties campaigned aggressively, revealing the widening
rift among right-wing Afrikaners.
   Last year, the Conservative Party drew 26 percent of the vote
nationwide and its support is growing, particularly in rural areas.
It is favored to win another special election in Transvaal later
this month.
   The Conservative Party has close links to the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, a paramilitary, white-supremacist group which
is taking an increasingly confrontational stance against the
government.
   Last Saturday, 5,000 movement members, many armed and wearing
khaki uniforms, staged a boisterous rally in Pretoria and then
marched to government buildings with a petition demanding creation
of a whites-only state.
   Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht, in a televised
debate Monday, refused to repudiate the movement.
   Treurnicht told F.W. De Klerk, a Cabinet minister who heads the
National Party in Transvaal: ``I defend the right of an
organization to join me in resisting the dangerous course you are
taking.''
   The National Party, in power since 1948, says the Conservative
Party's goal of returning to strict apartheid is unrealistic. Botha
advocates limited power-sharing, with blacks gaining a say in
national politics while whites retain control. Under apartheid, the
white minority controls the country and keeps blacks in separate
districts, schools and health services.
   Speaking last week in Standerton, Botha called for unity among
Afrikaners _ who comprise 3 million of the country's 5 million
whites _ and said the National Party would protect white interests.
   ``We are not prepared to sell out South Africa to Marxist
revolutionaries,'' Botha said. ``We are prepared to fight for our
country.
   ``Why are we (Afrikaners) cutting each others' throats when our
enemy is waiting?'' he asked.
   In an hour-long speech before about 1,000 people, Botha did not
mention the government bans imposed last week that forbid political
activity by 18 black opposition groups. Nor did he speak of any
future race reforms.
   The Star said in an editorial Tuesday: ``To pacify
right-wingers, the government has cracked down on black activists
.... The Nationalists have abandoned any commitment to reform.''
   Treurnicht spoke in Standerton the same night as Botha, drawing
a crowd of about 1,400. He said the National Party was capitulating
to the 26 million black majority.
   ``When you share power you are no longer in control,''
Treurnicht said. ``We don't want blacks in our Parliament and we
don't want to sit with them in theirs.''
   South Africa's Parliament has separate chambers for whites,
Asians and people of mixed race. Blacks are excluded.
   Treurnicht dismissed the recent crackdown as an election
gimmick, saying it was too little, too late.
   Botha, meanwhile, said he was not a ``bad Afrikaner'' simply
because he was willing to meet with ``reasonable'' black leaders.
   ``One has to be realistic,'' he said. ``This country consists
not only of whites ... Is there a farmer who can produce without
black labor? Is there an industrialist who can produce without
black workers?''

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Entitlement Cuts May Be Best for Cutting Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said today that deep cuts in ``entitlement'' programs, which
include Social Security and Medicare, may be the most realistic way
for cutting the federal budget deficit.
   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, also
called for a 15-cent-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax.
   But he said that, in general, tax increases do not appear to be
a feasible way for trimming the budget shortfall, which was $150
billion last year.
   ``There are upside limits to the share of income that can be
taxed,'' Greenspan said.
   He also said he saw little opportunity for further major cuts in
military spending, or in crucial federal programs such as the
prison and air control system.
   That leaves little left for budget cuts beyond entitlement
programs, which now make up about half of the federal budget.
   Entitlement programs are automatic-benefit social programs, in
which increases are tied to the rate of inflation.
   ``Simple arithmetic points clearly to those areas where the
scope for action is greatest,'' Greenspan testified.
   Even though trimming Social Security and other benefit programs
would be politically difficult, Greenspan told the panel that
``entitlement programs offer substantial opportunities for
long-term budgetary savings.''
   ``All the alternatives are known. The choices are political, not
economic,'' Greenspan testified. He appeared as the panel
considered President Reagan's $1.09 trillion budget for the fiscal
year that begins next Oct.1
   In other testimony, Greenspan said:
   _ Trade deficit improvements, led by higher import prices and
surging exports, would continue even at current exchange-rate
levels of the dollar.
   _ There was some danger of increased inflation in the coming
months from higher prices, but that these increases do ``not appear
to be on the order of a magnitude that should cause concern.''
   _ That ``there are no secret agreements'' among industrial
nations involving interest rate levels in the United States that
might be needed to support the goal of stabilizing the U.S. dollar
at its current exchange-rate value.

   An AIDS-stricken prostitute was acquitted
today of two counts of attempted poisoning for selling his tainted
blood to a blood bank.
   As the verdict was announced, Joseph Markowski, a 29-year-old
transient, rolled his eyes upward and nodded to his attorney, Guy
O'Brien.
   Jurors, who deliberated seven hours over two days, came to a
decision Tuesday, but the verdict was sealed until today because
O'Brien was unable to be in court.
   Markowski was charged with two counts of attempted poisoning for
selling his blood for $10 to Plasma Production Associates on June
22 and for trying to do so again June 25.
   He was arrested June 23 after screaming, ``Kill me! Kill me! I
have AIDS!'' in a Hollywood bank while trying to grab a security
guard's gun. When police arrested Markowski, they found the receipt
for the plasma center.
   Deputy District Attorney Antonio Barreto Jr. said Markowski knew
his blood could infect others but didn't care.
   But the defense said he had no intention of harming anyone.
   ``He made these donations for one reason and one reason only. He
was broke and he was destitute and he was homeless and he was
desperate,'' O'Brien said.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner originally charged Markowski with
attempted murder. But Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen dismissed
those counts, saying the law required a specific intent to kill
that was not present in the case.
   Markowski, who has acknowledged being a homosexual prostitute,
was tested positive for the presence of the deadly AIDS virus. He
has appeared pale and emaciated during his trial.

<HEAD>Cuban Electorate Grows in Strength, Sophistication</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many of his fellow Cuban-Americans, Agustin
Aguero is Republican and staunchly anti-communist.
   The vice president and manager at Florida National Bank's Little
Havana Branch calls himself a moderate conservative and voted for
President Reagan in 1980 and again in 1984.
   But Aguero is among the growing ranks of well-educated and
politically sophisticated Cuban-Americans who will require more
from presidential candidates than fierce anti-communist rhetoric.
   ``We Cubans are anti-communist, but that isn't our only goal,''
said Aguero, who left behind Cuba and Fidel Castro 17 years ago.
   In the waning days before Super Tuesday, when 20 states
including Florida will hold presidential primaries and caucuses,
Cuban-Americans are weighing their options with a heavy tilt toward
Vice President George Bush.
   More than two-thirds of the 165,274 Cuban-American voters
registered in Dade County are Republicans, according to the Dade
County Elections Department.
   Since the 1984 presidential elections, the Republican party in
Dade has added more than 42,000 Cuban-Americans to its rolls.
   In Tampa, the Cuban-American community, made up mostly of
second-and third-generation Cubans and some who have been around
since the turn of the century, tends to vote Democratic, according
to the Hillsborough County Elections Department, which keeps no
record of the ethnic breakdown among parties.
   But the much larger and politically mobilized Cuban-American
community in Miami is clearly dominated by Republican fervor.
   Here, Bush appears to be the ticket for most Cuban-Americans. He
has made regular forays here and has a strong organization headed
by Gov. Bob Martinez and his son, Jeb, who is the state secretary
of commerce.
   Bush could conceivably capture about 70 percent of the Cuban
vote, said Dade County Republican Party Chairman Carlos Salman. A
recent poll of south Florida Hispanics showed Bush the choice of 81
percent, with the other GOP candidates far back in single digits.
   Pat Robertson cannot be counted out, however. He has made a
serious pitch for the Cuban-American vote, criticized Castro as a
``butcher'' and his claim that there are Soviet nuclear weapons in
Cuba fell on receptive ears here.
   But the former television evangelist's recent anti-communist
appeals apparently aren't being taken very seriously, and some say
his impact on the Cuban vote will be negligible.
   ``I think the Cubans are very sophisticated ... They can see
when people are saying things just to cater to them,'' said Jaime
Suchlicki, director of the Institute of Inter-American Studies at
the University of Miami. ``They prefer truth and candor, not
political sloganism.''
   Bush's ties to the Reagan administration could hold negatives,
Suchlicki said.
   ``There has been an enormous amount of disillusionment vis-a-vis
Nicaragua,'' he said.
   As well, immigration policy also has been a sore point, with a
reversal in the special treatment once accorded Cubans by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``There is definitely a great deal of disappointment,'' said
Eddie Levy Rodriguez, former president and founder of the Cuban
American Democrats Association, ``with the way immigration
(officials) and the State Department are treating the Cubans from
Mariel and ... the fact that (Cuba and the United States) are
talking constantly, even though Reagan promised he would never deal
with Castro.''
   Foreign policy remains a top concern of Cuban-Americans, but
increasingly they say their other interests are not being
addressed, including but not limited to, issues such as the
economy, housing and unemployment.
   Aguero said the new generation of Cubans, who don't harbor
notions of ever going back to Cuba, simply have different ideals.
They consider themselves Americans first and Cubans second, he said.
   Levy said the number of Cuban-American Democrats is growing, and
he said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis should fare well among
them.
   But most of the Cuban-American population still votes Republican.
   ``We feel the Republicans have done more for the things we
like,'' Salman said. ``Since Ronald Reagan is president of the
United States we have not lost one country to communism. We also
are interested in being able to have better lives, better jobs, low
interest, low inflation and high employment. Republicans do this
more often and better than the Democrats.''

   A mutiny broke out on among usually meek and
patient London commuters, with passengers refusing orders to leave
their delay-plagued subway train until its driver took them to
their destination.
   Only about a dozen rebellious passengers were involved in the
Tuesday night incident on the ``tube,'' as the subway system is
known, but London Regional Transport said it was unprecedented,
given the meek and humble nature of the British commuter.
   To the London Evening Standard newspaper, it was ``The Great
Tube Revolt,'' and the mutineers' unidentified leader was ``a
superhero in the Clark Kent mold _ quiet, mild-mannered and
unassuming.''
   The excitement generated by the incident reflected not only the
frustrations of riding the system's aging Northern Line, but the
amazement of Londoners at the prospect of British commuters
abandoning their fabled reserve and making a public fuss.
   A similar incident occurred in New York City's subway system in
April 1985, when about a dozen commuters refused to leave a
disabled train until they were taken from it by transit police.
   London Regional Transport accused the tube mutineers of being
selfish.
   Spokesman David Morris said the problem began with delays caused
by a signal failure. Passengers bound for High Barnet, at the end
of the Northern Line, were told to disembark five stations before
their destination and wait for the next train.
   They started filing off, but then, according to the Standard, a
``mild-looking and well-dressed'' passenger declared: ``I've had
enough. I'm staying put. If we all do it, they'll have to take the
train on.''
   About a dozen passengers got back into the train, it said. More
passengers followed, and after hurried consultations the staff
bowed to the pressure and sent the train on.
   Morris said that had the passengers done as they were told, the
next train would have taken them to High Barnet, while the first
train could have turned back to collect passengers in central
London who had been delayed by the earlier signal failure.
   ``We had an overall picture of what was happening,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``Those passengers had only a narrow and selfish
view and put their needs above others.''
   Passenger Sheila Golding of High Barnet was quoted by the
Standard as saying the mutineers were cheering and laughing,
because ``we knew that if everyone did it _ and stayed put _ there
wasn't anything they could do about it.''
   Another passenger, Maria Gama, was quoted as saying: ``Everybody
was just totally fed up. The waiting room was freezing and nobody
could tell us why the train was stopping where it did. But when
everybody climbed back on, it was a marvelous moment.''
   The Northern Line, parts of which are more than a century old,
carries 700,000 passengers a day and serves 50 stations between
south and north London.
   Dubbed ``The Misery Line'' by newspapers, it is attacked for
defective trains and equipment, last-minute schedule changes,
signal failures and dirty stations. It is to have a major
modernization in the 1990s.
   Morris denied the line was worse than others but conceded that
some employees can be rude. ``They know what they're up against and
they probably don't look forward to coming to work any more than
passengers look forward to using the line,'' he said.

   By putting new emphasis on the threat
to Europe from Soviet tanks and troops, Western leaders hope to
blunt Moscow's drive to capitalize on splits within NATO on nuclear
arms strategy.
   In a joint statement Wednesday, leaders of the Western alliance
called on the Soviet Union and its allies to begin negotiations
aimed at eliminating the East's capability for launching a surprise
attack in Europe.
   They said Soviet non-nuclear forces facing NATO are far in
excess of Moscow's needs for self defense and ``cast a shadow over
the whole of Europe.''
   President Reagan called the declaration ``a major step forward
for the alliance.''
   The idea is to portray the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as
united in calling for fewer non-nuclear weapons at a time when the
alliance members cannot agree how far to go in scrapping atomic
arms.
   The NATO initiative also shifts the public spotlight away from
West Germany's dispute within the alliance over whether and when to
replace very short-range nuclear weapons with new, more effective
ones. Most of these weapons, if used, would strike German soil,
East or West.
   The main NATO theme is that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's
numerical superiority in conventional weapons and troops _ not the
existence of nuclear arms in Europe _ is the greatest danger to
Western security.
   According to Western estimates, the Warsaw Pact holds about a
3-to-1 advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2-to-1 edge in
combat aircraft and troops, including reserves in the Soviet Union.
Moscow contends that East-West conventional forces are roughly
equivalent.
   The stress on conventional arms, NATO hopes, will steal some of
the momentum from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign to
woo the European public with calls for ridding their continent of
all nuclear weapons.
   NATO leaders agree that some nuclear arms are needed in Europe
to deter attack.
   Gorbachev appears to have significantly improved his public
image in Western Europe by agreeing last year to a longstanding
U.S. proposal to eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear weapons,
based mostly in Europe.
   The 16 NATO nations have strongly endorsed this deal, known as
the INF Treaty. The Senate is expected to ratify the treaty this
spring.
   But in the aftermath of the INF deal, the alliance has fallen
into disagreement over whether to press immediately for East-West
negotiations to reduce a large Soviet edge in short-range nuclear
missiles. West Germany, which is most directly threatened by these
weapons, wants such talks to start soon; most of the other NATO
allies do not.
   The Brussels NATO summit was not expected to discuss this
quandry in detail, much less find a solution. Instead, a key aim of
the meeting was to turn the public's attention to other aspects of
East-West relations, including human rights and non-nuclear arms
talks.
   The NATO members and the seven Warsaw Pact nations have been
working for a year to agree on the framework for a new set of
negotiations to establish a more stable balance of conventional
forces in Europe.
   These talks, likely to begin this fall, would replace a narrower
set of East-West negotiations on cutting troop levels, which began
in 1973. After 15 years, these talks have not produced a single
agreement.
   NATO members hope the new negotiations would focus more directly
on warfighting equipment as well as troops. These talks also would
encompass the full European area, from the Atlantic to the Ural
mountains. The old troop talks were limited to the central front.
   Even though the Western allies acknowledge that it may take
years to reach a meaningful agreement on conventional forces, they
hope the drive to reach the bargaining table will put NATO back on
the diplomatic offensive.

   Children at a Hare Krishna commune have
been subjected to sexual abuse and forced into communal marriages,
according a court petition filed by a former sect member seeking
custody of her children.
   The petition was filed with the state Supreme Court, which gave
no immediate answer Tuesday to the appeal by Christina Mills, a
former Hare Krishna member who claims her children are in danger at
the religious sect's West Virginia commune.
   Mills alleges that New Vrindaban, the nation's largest Krishna
community, is fraught with polygamy, child molestation and sexual
abuse, her lawyer told the court Tuesday.
   Mills, now a legal secretary in San Antonio, Texas, is asking
the high court to remove her three children, ages 2, 3 and 6, from
their father's care at New Vrindaban.
   ``These children have no protection today but in this court,''
lawyer David Gold told justices.
   The northern West Virginia community is the target of several
federal and state investigations.
   A family law master had ruled that the children were in jeopardy
at the commune, but a circuit judge stayed that order at the
request of the children's father, Dennis Gorrick. Mills is
appealing that stay.
   Gorrick's attorney, James Lees, said the family law master has
issued a gag order on the case and he could not discuss it.
   Members of the commune have faced criminal charges, including
murder and manslaughter charges against fringe members of the
commune, and child molestation charges against two former commune
teachers. The sect's leader, Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada,
recently was found innocent of arson charges, although another
commune member was convicted in the case.
   The Krishnas have denied any wrongdoing and have accused
authorities of harassment.
   Mills' petitions make a broad range of allegations against the
Krishna community.
   Gorrick ``has been simultaneously `married' to the petitioner
and other women, said marriages being ordered by the swami,''
according to the petition.
   Children at New Vrindaban ``have been subject to sexual abuse by
the very teachers entrusted with their safety and well-being. Said
abuse includes the repeated and systematic oral and anal homosexual
rape of school children at said school by the headmaster,''
according to the court petition.
   ``Parents who have confronted the swami about said sexual abuse
have been advised by said swami that, `sex is sex,''' the petition
states.
   ``Authorities at (New Vrindaban) regularly contribute to the
delinquency of minors, by forcing girls ... to drop out of school
and marry ... as young as the age of 12 years,'' the petition
states.
   Gorrick, whom Mills calls the commune's chief fund-raiser, ``has
directly caused or contributed'' to the alleged practice of using
commune children as young as 11 to solicit donations, according to
the petition.

   A juvenile court judge ordered a
psychiatric evaluation for a 13-year-old boy who chopped off his
uncle's hand at the uncle's request.
   Juvenile Judge Kenneth Turner said Tuesday that the youth was
charged with mayhem, the crime of cutting off a body part of
another, after he chopped off his uncle's hand Sunday at the man's
home in Lakeland, near Memphis.
   Shelby County Sheriff's Department Inspector Buck Wood said the
uncle, James Veazey, 33, had a history of treatment for mental
problems. Wood said the man told his nephew he had rabies in the
hand and asked him to chop it off.
   Sgt. Travis Taylor said the youth had said Veazey had repeatedly
asked him to cut off the hand. ``I got tired of listening to it and
got on with it,'' Taylor quoted the youth as saying.
   The boy used a single-blade ax to cut off the hand and then
threw it into a garbage can, retrieving the hand only when a
neighbor doubted his tale of cutting it off.
   Veazey had prepared a bucket of hydrogen peroxide and water to
treat the stump of his arm, Taylor said.
   Neighbors called an ambulance and the sheriff's department after
they were shown the hand.
   Veazey was taken to the Regional Medical Center for surgery,
then transferred to Memphis Veterans Medical Center.
   Taylor said relatives told him Veazey had himself chopped off a
finger of the hand in the Shelby County Jail last year.
   The severed hand could not be reattached, Taylor said.

   Vietnam on Wednesday returned to the
United States what are believed to be remains of 17 American
servicemen missing in action in the Vietnam War, a U.S. official
said.
   The Vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other
missing Americans, said Lt. Col. Paul Mather, leader of a U.S.
military team that received the remains in a ceremony at Hanoi's
Noi Bai Airport.
   The return was the largest in two years and the fourth largest
since the war ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government.
   The largest return was in August 1985, when 26 sets of remains
were returned.
   Mather said some of the remains received Wednesday involved
cases of highest priority to the United States.
   Mather said a U.S. honor guard saluted under chilly, overcast
skies as the metal caskets of remains, each draped with a folded
American flag, were loaded onto a C-141 transport plane for the
flight to Hawaii. The names attached to the remains were not
released.
   They will be analyzed there by the Army Central Identification
Laboratory to see if they belong to any of the nearly 1,800
Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   Mather said some of the names that the Vietnamese provided,
along with the remains and written reports, are among a list of 70
that the United States considers of highest priority.
   Retired Gen. John W. Vessey, acting as a U.S. presidential
emissary, handed over the list of names during a mission to Hanoi
in August.
   The United States says that in these ``discrepancy cases,''
there is compelling evidence that Vietnamese authorities at some
level know what happened to the missing men. Evidence includes
photographs of captured Americans who never emerged from prisoner
of war camps.
   Mather said the remains were mostly of airmen. Most missing
airmen were shot down during bombing missions in North Vietnam.
   The Vietnamese told Mather they would start the next round of
``technical talks'' on MIAs on March 12. During these talks, which
Hanoi has agreed to hold six times annually, experts of both sides
discuss ways of retreiving remains, locating warplane crash sites
and related issues.
   Wednesday's turnover was the third since Hanoi agreed during
Vessey's visit to break a deadlock and resume efforts to account
for American MIAs.
   The United States pledged then to look into Vietnam's own
humanitarian problems. An official U.S. medical team flew to Hanoi
on Wednesday to continue that mission, said the spokesman of the
U.S. embassy in Bangkok, Ross Petzing.
   Three previous medical teams have studied the plight of disabled
war veterans and other humanitarian cases and made recommendations
on how private U.S. charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation
programs.
   Washington has encouraged private assistance but refused
Vietnamese requests for direct U.S. government aid. The United
States has withheld diplomatic recognition and official aid to
protest Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia.

   The 3{-year-old girl who received five organs
in a landmark transplant operation is progressing ``with no major
bumps'' in her recovery four months after the surgery, hospital
officials said Wednesday.
   Tabatha Foster, from Madisonville, Ky., was reported still in
serious condition in a private room of Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
   Tabatha underwent surgery ending Nov. 1 to replace her liver,
pancreas, small intestine and parts of her stomach and colon. She
suffered from short gut syndrome, a congenital defect, and would
have died without the transplant, according to doctors.
   ``Her recovery has really been somewhat uneventful,'' said
hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. ``She is really progressing
fine. There have been no major bumps along the way.''
   Tabatha is still being fed intravenously, through a special pump
to her stomach, and by mouth with a special baby food formula,
according to Miss McMahon. The girl has never eaten solid food.
   Tabatha's surgeons said they have no precedent for feeding such
a patient. Two other patients underwent similar operations in the
United States in recent years, but they died within a few days.
   Her mother, Sandra, is at her bedside daily, Miss McMahon said.
   President Reagan appealed for donations and prayers for the girl
in his weekly radio address Jan. 23. Reagan also contributed $1,000
to a special fund for her medical bills.

<HEAD>Judge Uses Reading And Library Time As Part of Juvenile Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who orders some juvenile offenders to
go to the library and read as a condition of probation says he
harbors no illusions that it will help everyone. He'd settle for
one out of four.
   ``I understand that a good number of young people will laugh at
this,'' Baltimore Circuit Judge John Carroll Byrnes said in a
recent interview. ``Some will try, but will fall by the wayside
when they get back in with their buddies in their environment. And
others simply won't be able, intellectually.
   ``But I'm convinced that a significant minority, once coerced
into reading, will be so attracted by the experience that it will
change their lives. I'm optimistic that we can do it. If we can
reach 25 percent of the youthful offenders we see, I'd call this
plan a roaring success.''
   The judge, who splits his time between juvenile court and the
city's Circuit Court, said he has made reading a part of probation
since he came on the bench about five years ago. An ad hoc
committee of librarians, educators and parole and probation
officers was formed a year ago and hopes to have a formal list of
suitable titles, basically from the junior high school level, by
the end of the year.
   Some of the suggested titles include ``I Am The Darker Brother''
by Arnold Adoff, ``Westmark'' by Lloyd Alexander, ``Anna To The
Infinite Power'' by Mildred Ames, ``Curse of the Blue Figurine'' by
John Bellairs, ``Sounder'' by William A. Armstrong, and ``Are You
There God? It's Me, Margaret'' by Judy Blum.
   Byrnes also said he has restricted television viewing as a
condition of probation in some cases. ``It's interesting _ no
matter what you say before that, they shudder when I come to the
one about television,'' he said.

   Police on Wednesday arrested a

   Police said they weren't sure how many attackers burst into the
bar, in a central square, on Tuesday night and began shooting,
first at Giuseppe Postorino, 43, who fell mortally wounded, then at
three others, the ANSA news agency reported.
   Investigators speculated that the target was Postorino, who
police linked to the 'Ndrangheta, the version of the Mafia here in
Calabria, a region at the ``toe'' of the boot-shaped Italian
peninsula.
   The other dead man was identified in news reports as Francesco

<HEAD>Mayor Pardons Ferret Scheduled for Execution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMERS BRANCH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felix the ferret was scheduled for
execution this week, but a public outcry resulted in a pardon from
the mayor.
   ``We are going to ferret out a solution,'' said Farmers Branch
Mayor John Dodd, who spared the animal Monday.
   The fuzzy, pink-eyed ferret was caged at the city's animal
shelter.
   Farmers Branch police Officer Rodney Wallace spotted the animal
Friday during patrol. When he opened the door of his car and
whistled, the ferret jumped into his lap and snuggled against him.
   Wallace took the ferret to the animal shelter in the Dallas
suburb and attached a note to his cage that said, ``Please do not
destroy. If no one claims it, I want it back.''
   Because of a city ordinance prohibiting exotic animals,
officials said the ferret would be destroyed if his owner was not
found. As news spread of the ferret's plight, the animal shelter
was deluged with requests to adopt the creature.
   Animal control officer Mike Worsham said his department could
not take responsibility for placing Felix for adoption because
there is no approved vaccine for ferrets and the animals sometimes
bite.
   But Dodd promised Monday to ``cut through the red tape.'' The
mayor said he spoke to the owner of an animal rehabilitation center
about taking the animal. The center has a state license to keep
wild animals, which will prevent the ferret's death.
   ``He's got a reprieve,'' Dodd said.

<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. announced today
its board had accepted a multibillion-dollar acquisition bid by
R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. over a competing offer from Campeau Corp.
   But Campeau refused to give up its quest for Federated, the
nation's fifth-largest retailer.
   Federated and Macy signed a definitive agreement to create a new
company, Macy's-Federated Inc., said Jim Fingeroth, a spokesman for
Macy, which has nearly 100 department and specialty stores.
   The agreement provides for Macy to begin a cash tender offer of
$74.50 a share for about 80 percent of Federated's 89.6 million
outstanding shares, or a total of $5.25 billion, Fingeroth said.
The remaining Federated shares would be exchanged for stock in the
new company.
   Campeau had offered $68 a share in cash for all Federated
shares, or $6.1 billion.
   After the agreement was announced, Campeau said it would proceed
with a $66 cash tender offer for Federated.
   ``Macy's bid is not competitive and we intend to prevail in the
marketplace,'' a Campeau statement said. ``It is now up to
Federated's shareholders to decide.''
   Trading in Federated stock was halted on the New York Stock
Exchange prior to the Federated announcement. After trading
resumed, its stock rose 50 cents per share to $67.50.
   Macy's bid came to light Monday as Federated directors met to
consider whether to accept the Campeau offer.
   Campeau began its bid Jan. 25, offering $47 a share. The bid was
rejected as inadequate, and Campeau sweetened the offer several
times before arriving at the $68 bid.
   Late last week, Federated officials decided to negotiate an
agreement with Campeau, and the Toronto-based developer's offer was
still on the table as the Macy bid was considered.
   Macy originally offered $73.80 per share and then increased its
bid before the agreement was signed.
   Wall Street analysts said Tuesday the rival bids were attractive
for different reasons.
   ``Campeau is sitting there with cash, and Macy's walked in the
door with some cash but the opportunity for the company to enjoy
future growth _ as opposed to Campeau's potential breaking up or
dismantling of the company,'' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with
Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   He referred to the fact that Campeau sold off most of Allied
Stores Corp.'s divisions after he bought the company in December
1986.
   New York-based Macy, which is privately held, is the nation's
10-largest retailer.
   A Federated acquisition represents for Macy's a chance to
control some of its major competitors, such as Bloomingdale's, and
to increase its market share at the same time, said Michele Davis,
of the investment firm Oppenheimer & Co.
   ``They can position Bloomingdale's at one price point and Macy's
at another price point such that they don't compete head on with
each other,'' she said.
   The deal also would give Macy more outlets for its extensive
line of private label merchandise, said Monroe Greenstein, of the
investment firm Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.
   Campeau was fighting for Federated because it does not want to
lose the opportunity to gain the foothold into major U.S. shopping
centers that Federated stores would provide, Greenstein said.
   Moreover, that entree could go instead to Macy board member A.
Alfred Taubman, himself a shopping mall developer, Greenstein said.
   The agreement between Macy and Federated called for the new
company's board to include significant representation from the
existing Federated board.
   Macy, one of the nation's biggest and best-known retailers, was
taken private by a management group in a $3.6 billion leveraged
buyout in 1986. Its stores rang up $5.21 billion in sales during
the fiscal year ended Aug. 1.
   Federated took in $11 billion last year from its more than 650
department stores, supermarkets and other outlets nationwide,
including Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Filene's, Burdine's,
Lazarus, Bullock's and Rich's department stores; Gold Circle
discount stores and Ralphs supermarkets.
   In December 1986, Campeau acquired giant Allied Stores, whose
operations still include the Jordan Marsh, Stern's and Ann Taylor
chains.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Graham's Confession Admissible in Bodies Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today ruled the confession by a man
to the slayings of seven women in his apartment could be admitted
at trial and rejected a claim of illegal arrest.
   Common Pleas Judge Robert Latrone denied a defense motion to
suppress the confession and all physical evidence seized by police
in Harrison Graham's home last August. Defense attorney Joel
Moldovsky also had sought to have Graham's arrest declared illegal.
   Latrone said the validity of the statement will be up to the
jury.
   Moldovsky and Assistant District Attorney Roger King then met
with Latrone to discuss the start of jury selection. No date was
immediately set.
   The ruling ended a 14-day pretrial hearing for Graham, accused
of killing seven women after luring them to his apartment with
liquor and drugs. Police found human remains in and near Graham's
apartment.
   Moldovsky is mounting an insanity defense for his client. He
claims Graham has three personalities: Frank, a foul-mouthed junkie
who kills women during sex; Marty, an easy-going, mother-worshiping
guy who confessed to the murders; and Junior, a mute, bad-mannered
2-year-old who and likes cartoon characters.
   Graham's full name is Harrison Frank Graham Jr.
   Moldovsky last week asked for new psychiatric evaluations of
Graham when the suspect described how he punched another inmate
during a fight at the Detention Center.
   ``Frank did it,'' said Graham, describing to Latrone how he
responded to an inmate who had kicked him.
   King has dismissed the multiple-personality claim as ``just
smoke.'' He says Graham is a shrewd, street-smart faker who
deserves the electric chair.

   King Fahd on Wednesday inaugurated
the King Fahd International Stadium, the largest free-span
structure in the world.
   The official opening of the stadium coincided with the ninth
Gulf Cup Soccer Championships in which seven teams from Arab
countries are participating.
   In a ceremonial message, King Fahd said ``this is eloquent proof
of the progress which this country has made in all fields.''
   There have been hints in the pro-government media that the
kingdom would like to be a host for the Olympic Games.
   The multimillion-dollar stadium can accommodate 75,000
spectators, with the design owing something to the traditional
shape of a bedouin tent but merged with the most advanced
engineering technology.
   The exterior of the stadium is in the shape of a circle with a
diamater of 290 yards. The bowl contains the playing field with
natural grass, imported from Kenya, the 400-yard running track, the
long jump pits, pole vaulting area and javelin throw run.
   The roof membrane is stretched between 24 tent-shaped peaks,
each supported by a 60-yard vertical mast. The covering is a
Teflon-coated fabric.
   The royal and VIP pavilion, with six floors of exclusively
furnished rooms for royal receptions, seats 750.
   The grass is watered from a 15-inch-deep water underground
reservoir.

   Bands of youths hurled bombs, burned
cars and trucks, and shouted anti-government slogans Wednesday
during a general strike called to disrupt Parliamentary elections.
At least eight people were injured.
   Teen-agers and children, several appearing younger than 10 years
old, stopped a city garbage truck in downtown Dhaka, smashed it
with clubs and set it ablaze.
   ``We set fire to Ershad's throne!'' the youngsters chanted,
referring to President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   Demonstrators stoned and taunted police burned election banners,
along with at least one scooter and a taxi.
   The opposition called the strike to protest Thursday's
Parliamentary elections. Many here believe the elections have more
potential for violence than for halting the stalemate between
Ershad and his foes.
   Eight people were reported hospitalized with injuries from small
bombs, and two were in serious condition, police and hospital
officials said.
   But no major confrontations erupted between police and
protestors, and the city was calm overall.
   In the southern port city of Chittagong, witnesses said at least
50 people were injured in clashes between protestors and police.
The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said protestors
threw bombs at the office of the local municipal corporation and
damaged several vehicles.
   In the capital, the strike appeared successful, shutting down
shops and businesses and chasing from the streets the bicycle
rickshaws that make Dhaka traffic a nightmare.
   But the strike appeared to have little effect outside Dhaka
other than stopping trucks and buses from running.
   It was the 24th strike called by the opposition since Nov. 10,
when it began its campaign to oust Ershad.
   In a move to compromise with his opponents, Ershad dissolved the
330-seat Parliament last December, 3{ years before its term was to
expire, and scheduled new elections. But opposition leaders have
said no election conducted under Ershad can be fair, and they are
urging a voter boycott.
   At least 33 people have been died since Nov. 10, either in
clashes, by police gunfire, or in campaign-related violence.
   Sheik Hasina of the opposition Awami League said Wednesday that
she expected only 5 percent or 10 percent of the 47.8 million
voters to cast ballots.
   More than 900 candidates from 102 political parties are running
for Parliament. Eighteen candidates, all from Ershad's Jatiya
Party, have already been declared elected for lack of opposition,
and voting in one district was canceled because of the slaying of a
candidate.
   In addition to the Parliamentary election, municipal elections
will be held in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, and
Rajshahi.
   In similar polling for town and village councils across the
country three weeks ago, more than 100 people were killed in
battles between supporters of candidates.
   Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and won election
in 1986. He ordered 9,000 army troops and about 290,000 local
police and paramilitary troops deployed to ensure security for the
elections.

   The State Department is preparing to notify
all U.S. banks where the Panamanian government has deposits not to
engage in any transactions with the regime that seized power in
Panama last week, a lawyer for a Panamanian opposition group said
today.
   William D. Rogers, an attorney for the Arnold & Porter law firm,
said the Panamanian government is believed to have deposits in five
U.S. banks and that law suits are being drawn up to ensure bank
compliance with the measure.
   Rogers told a news conference the State Department action would
require the banks to make disbursements only to the ambassador who
represented the deposed government of President Eric Arturo
Delvalle.
   Later, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the department was preparing documentation certifying that persons
designated by Delvalle are the legitimate representatives of the
Panamanian government.
   But she did not say what the legal consequences of the
certification were or why it was being prepared.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has maintained that Delvalle's
ouster was unconstitutional, said he had no precise figures on the
amounts of money in the Panamanian accounts but estimated the
number to be $50 million.
   In New York, lawyers for Delvalle sued in federal court today to
block a New York bank from turning over millions of dollars to new
government in Panama.
   A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking
the Republic National Bank of New York from transferring an
estimated $10 million.
   A hearing on the matter is slated for Monday before U.S.
District Judge Lloyd F. McMahon.
   The lawsuit seeks to establish title to the funds held in the
Republic National Bank account and ``to prevent their transfer into
the hands of a military dictatorship ... which has attempted to
seize power and overthrow the lawful authorities of the Republic of
Panama,'' according to court papers.
   In Washington, Sosa said the State Department is seriously
considering withholding from Panama the next payment on the fees
the United States gives Panama for use of the Panama Canal. He
estimated that figure at $8 million.
   Ms. Oakley confirmed that a request from the Delvalle government
to put the funds in escrow had been received and that the State
Department was consulting with other agencies on how to proceed.
   Delvalle fired military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega last
Thursday but the defense chief ignored the order and rallied his
allies in the National Assembly against the president. On Friday,
the assembly voted to oust Delvalle and installed Education
Minister Manuel Solis Palma in his place.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug smuggling charges by two
Florida grand juries and has been under heavy diplomatic, economic
and political pressure by the Reagan administration to step aside
and open the way for civilian-led constitutional rule.
   Among the banks listed by Rogers which would be affected by the
order are Marine Midland, Irving Trust, Bankers Trust and the
Republic National Bank. He said all have headquarters in New York.
   ``Every dime we can find is in those banks,'' Rogers said. He
added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for
whatever payments it makes to the current Panamanian government.
   The coalition of opposition leaders believes that the Panamanian
government is facing a grave cash flow problem and is extremely
vulnerable to economic pressure from the United States.
   Unlike other countries, Panama cannot cover its cash shortages
by printing new money because the dollar is the national currency.
   Sosa said international opposition to the new government was
evident earlier this week when, he claimed, only eight ambassadors
showed up for a State of the Union address. From the Western
Hemisphere, he said, only Cuba and Nicaragua attended.

   Driving through the streets of this
diplomatic capital, one would never guess that the leaders of the
Western world are in town to chart the future course of the NAT0
alliance.
   But then, Brussels tends to take its summits in stride.
   There are no banners, no curious onlookers and few flags to bear
witness to the presence of President Reagan and 15 other government
leaders for the two-day NATO summit that began Wednesday.
   Except for occasional motorcycle escorts leading official
limousines on a weaving course through traffic, the city's normal
routine has not been disrupted noticeably.
   Security is tightest for Reagan, who is staying in the 19th
century Chateau Stuyvenberg on the outskirts of the city, next to
the Royal Palace. The chateau's wooded grounds are patrolled by
guard dogs and mounted police.
   ``It is a fortress,'' said one police official, who spoke only
on condition that he not be identified. ``Everything is tiptop in
order.''
   Brussels is a stolid, middle-class city that for decades has
played host to the European Economic Community, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, several offices of the European Parliament and
numerous international lobbying groups.
   Strict security for highly placed officials is a routine and
unobtrusive element in this city of about 1 million people.
Brussels handled its last summit, for the EEC, only three weeks ago.
   The pace of the city is geared toward international meetings.
Taxi drivers ask their customers whether they prefer a normal or a
fast trip out to the sprawling NATO headquarters in the quiet
suburb of Evere.
   The only sign of summit-induced chaos was seen Wednesday at the
NATO press center, where an estimated 2,000 journalists jostled
each other for copies of official statements, draft beer and
interviews with the few official sources willing to brave the crush.
   Reflecting the Belgian taste for good living, beer began to flow
from the press center taps at about 11 a.m.
   A minor incident occurred when a NATO security agent tried to
grab a microphone from an American television network crew member
while the NATO leaders posed for a group photograph.
   A U.S. security agent accompanying Reagan stepped in with the
admonition, ``Do not manhandle journalists,'' and the NATO agent
backed off.
   Police spokesman Jacques Devaux said 500 uniformed Belgian
policemen were working around the clock ``with uncommon vigilance''
to protect every NATO leader. A Brussels newspaper said they were
being reinforced by about 500 state security force personnel.
   Days before the summit opened Wednesday, police guards were
reinforced and additional metal detectors were installed at
Zaventem International Airport. Areas where summit leaders were to
arrive were swept repeatedly for explosives, but none was found.
   The summiteers, who brought their own security forces along,
were staying in hotels and embassies scattered throughout the city.
Overall security was being coordinated at a command center in the
Interior Ministry.
   Police detained 20 anti-nuclear protesters for identity checks
after they tried to demonstrate outside NATO headquarters without a
police permit.

<HEAD>SAA Air Crash Recording to Be Kept Secret</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday
it won't release a recording of the conversation between a control
tower and a South African Airways jumbo jet that crashed Nov. 28 in
the Indian Ocean, killing all 159 people aboard.
   The announcement was made by Supreme Court Justice Cecil Margo,
head of an international board that began meeting Monday to
investigate the cause of the crash on a flight from Taipei, Taiwan
to Johannesburg.
   The Boeing 747 went down minutes before it was due to refuel in
Mauritius.
   Reports at the time had quoted Mauritian officials as saying the
pilot reported fire or smoke in the cockpit.
   South African officials took over the investigation from
Mauritian aviation authorities, and no further information was
released. The South African officials said at the time that quotes
from the recording would not be released because they might be
misunderstood and some people might believe they were being accused
or blamed.
   Margo said the recorded conversation was indistinct in parts and
experts had disagreed about what was said, so no official
transcript or sound from the recording would be released.
   Margo said the board had decided Wednesday that the cockpit
voice recorder, flight data recorder and other pieces of the jet
must be recovered ``at all costs'' from the crash site 14,520 feet
under the ocean north of Mauritius.
   Aboard the jet were 71 South Africans, 47 Japanese, 30
Taiwanese, and one or two passengers from Australia, Mauritius,
Hong Kong, the United States, Holland, Britain, Germany, Denmark
and South Korea. Only 11 bodies were recovered.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   Feb. 29
   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of
Panama:
   Gen. Manuel Noriega, Panama's drug-running strongman, seems
still to be in control of his troubled nation.
   Washington has been trying for months to figure out a way to
depose Noriega, who recently was indicted in Miami on charges of
drug trafficking. Obviously, the U.S. government was involved in
President Eric Arturo Delvalle's attempt to dismiss Noriega from
command of Panama's defense force.
   The maneuver may eventually contribute to an erosion of support
for Noriega among the country's military officer corps. But so far,
most of those in the echelons below Noriega either are in cahoots
with the general or too afraid to buck him.
   Noriega also faces strong opposition from the public, many of
whom rioted last summer because of the country's declining economy
and reports of corruption at the top.
   Noriega has got to go, and the United States should do all it
can to hasten that event. This should include an economic squeeze,
by Washington and other capitals, that could cause increased
resentment against the general.

   Baltimore Sun on military spending:
   When a secretary of the Navy jumps ship or walks the plank, it
is fitting that he made a big splash.
   James E. Webb has done just that by unleashing a petulant attack
on Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, a veteran public servant
who has taken on the tough, thankless job of bringing Pentagon
spending and planning into the realm of reality. ...
   In the end, Carlucci ordered the scrapping of 16 aging frigates
as part of a $12 billion cut in fiscal 1989 Navy spending. This was
a sensible decision, in keeping with plans for a lean but tough
defense establishment. ...
   Webb's spectacular manner of departure may have one beneficial
effect. It could trigger a defense debate that most Washington
politicians would prefer to put off until the November elections.
   The next president and the next Congress need to avoid sharp
peaks and valleys in military spending and to devise a defense
strategy that is compatible with the nation's resources,
commitments and priorities.

   Salem (Ore.) Statesman-Journal on Jimmy Swaggart:
   A repentant Jimmy Swaggart has confessed and apologized publicly
for sins of sexual misconduct. ...
   With this latest scandal, the tendency among much of the public
may be to condemn all radio and television religious ministries.
   That would be understandable, but it also would be a mistake.
Some of these programs, a few dating back for 40 years or more,
have a clean record of service and financial accountability.
Nevertheless, they often are smeared with the same broad brush.
   Swaggart, (Jim) Bakker and other dimming stars of the glitzy
world of television evangelism need our compassion, but they also
need to clean up their lives and their organizations.

   The McPherson (Kan.) Sentinel on the arrest of an absentee
senator:
   We had thought that House Speaker Jim Wright had sunk to the
bottom depths in congressional decorum a couple of months ago when
he had the effrontery to make time stand still in order to gain
passage of a bill he wanted.
   But after Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd's actions (last)
week, Wright is barely running a close second.
   We have often thought that Congress resembled a circus more than
it resembles the world's greatest deliberative body, but Byrd made
it complete with Keystone Kops ... when he ordered the arrest of
Republican Bob Packwood in order to get a quorum.
   We hope, of course, that Byrd's tactic ... was worth such
despicable conduct, because Byrd has certainly degraded both
himself and the Senate.
   Somehow we can't help but doubt that it was.

   The Times of Trenton, N.J., on the new tax laws:
   There's a variation of the popular TV game show ``Jeopardy!''
that you can play by calling your local Internal Revenue Service
offices. Ask them a technical question about the 1986 tax law
changes that go into effect this year.
   What's the ``jeopardy'' part? Well, one fourth of the time the
answer will be wrong. ...
   But if you rely on that answer when you file your return, and
underpay your tax as a result, you're still subject to a penalty
and interest for underpaying.
   A year ago ... the new tax witholding forms ... turned out to be
so arcane that the (IRS) had to waive deadlines and develop new
forms.
   It's hard to figure out how a law that was so widely understood
and welcomed _ as an effort to make the tax code more fair, logical
and efficient _ could have spawned such confusion.

   The New Ulm (Minn.) Journal on Pat Robertson:
   Republican presidential hopeful Pat Robertson has a problem with
making outrageous statements that he can't back up with facts.
   He labeled Planned Parenthood supporters as people trying to
create a master race just because birth control pioneer Margaret
Sanger dabbled in eugenics back around the turn of the century.
   He warned us that there are nuclear missiles in Cuba and offered
as proof that ``no one can prove there aren't missiles there.''
   Now he has the gall to suggest, though he admits he has no
proof, that the George Bush campaign is behind TV preacher Jimmy
Swaggart's fall from grace in an attempt to discredit Robertson, a
former TV evangelist trying hard to distance himself from that past.
   Robertson doesn't need anyone to discredit him. He appears to be
doing a fine job of it himself.

   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on playing politics with
appointments:
   Ohio's Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum has gotten himself all
twisted out of shape over the Justice Department's refusal to
release certain of its files to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   The files relate to the department's investigation of reports
that former U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland Faith Ryan Whittlesey
mishandled some entertainment funds.
   She was said to have entertained American friends with privately
donated money that was intended to be used to fete foreign
officials. The Justice Department said there was no evidence to
produce a ``viable criminal case.''
   That wasn't good enough for Metzenbaum. He wants to come up with
something politically damaging to the Reagan administration.
   Metzenbaum is holding up Senate confirmation of four Reagan
appointees to federal court judgeships.
   This isn't just playing politics. It's hostage-taking, and it
ill becomes a senator of the United States.

   Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader on President Reagan's budget:
   However else he is remembered, Ronald Reagan will go down as the
biggest spender in the history of the presidency.
   The $1.1 trillion national budget he proposed recently would
only increase military spending about 2 percent.
   In addition, Reagan has an agreement with Congress to run up
only $136 billion more debt during the next budget year. In fiscal
1987, they accumulated $148 billion in debt.
   Minor concessions like that will not erase the fact that Reagan,
more than any other president, has led the nation into what seems
like a bottomless pit of overdue bills.
   Of course, Reagan is not entirely to blame. Every Democratic and
Republican representative and senator who has served in Congress
since Reagan took office in 1981 must shoulder part of the blame
for the nation's spending problems.
   Reagan, the candidate who promised to balance the budget, has
failed financially. He has less than a year remaining in his term _
not enough time to balance the budget.
   The good news is that this is an election year. Taxpayers and
voters have the opportunity _ and an obligation _ to hold
presidential candidates accountable on that issue.

   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on the Supreme Court parody
decision:
   When the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a unanimous decision, you
might figure it was a cut-and-dried case. Not so with last week's
decision upholding Hustler magazine's disgusting parody of the Rev.
Jerry Falwell.
   While the court seemed to grant almost absolute protection to
speech that is intended as satire, it left blurred the line that
distinguishes fact from fiction, parody from portrayal.
   At issue was a 1983 takeoff of a well-known liquor advertisement
in which famous people describe the ``first time'' they tasted the
product. In Hustler's version, Falwell was depicted as having sex
with his mother in an outhouse.
   Outraged, the televangelist and founder of the Moral Majority
sued publisher Larry Flynt for $45 million for libel, invasion of
privacy and infliction of emotional distress.
   A lower court had no trouble discerning that the parody was
fiction. Thus Falwell did not have a case for libel. ... But it
awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress.
   It took the Supreme Court to rule that awards for emotional
distress require ... (proof of) factual falsehood, the standard for
libel. ... And now the court rules draw a distinction between
satire, which is absolutely free, and seriousness, which is not.
   Free speech should mean just that. ... In the marketplace of
ideas and public opinion, truth almost always will win out.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on foreign-held patents:
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued 89,385 patents last
year. A stunning 46.6 percent of them went to people who are not
U.S. citizens.
   Americans are inventing more things than they used to, say
officials at the patent office. But non-Americans are inventing at
a faster pace.
   In the past two decades, the share of U.S. patents awarded to
foreigners has more than doubled. From the patent office's figures,
the chief competitors of the future will be the Japanese, who
claimed 17,288 patents, and the West Germans, who registered 8,030.
   It seems likely that more of the next generation of Americans
will be paying license fees, and more inventors in other nations
will be sitting back collecting royalties.

   The Asheville (N.C.) Citizen on Jimmy Swaggart:
   So one more television evangelist falls. Jimmy Swaggart is one
of the biggest, but the country has become accustomed to seeing TV
ministers stumble because of worldly pleasures.
   The only remarkable thing about the Swaggart case is the extent
to which everyone is focusing on his physical sin, that of
consorting with a prostitute. In the eyes of his church and his
followers, that was his greatest offense, and they already have
begun forgiving him.
   Give Swaggart credit _ he knew what he had to do. He prostrated
himself before the elders of the Assemblies of God denomination,
his congregation, his TV audience and God himself. Swaggart blamed
no one else.
   He admitted sinning, took full responsibility and begged
forgiveness. Most of his sympathizers were not just touched, they
were overwhelmed.
   Amid all this glorious healing, it seems almost unkind to note
that Swaggart did not admit his sin until he had no choice _ until
it was reported by a fellow TV evangelist and competitor whom
Swaggart had helped discredit and drive out of business.
   He did not confess until his worldly empire was at stake. Where
were Swaggart's humility and repentance during all those months or
years before he was found out?

   Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on the Supreme Court's parody decision:
   The Supreme Court decision in the case of Falwell vs. Flynt is a
reassuring vote of confidence in the principle of freedom of speech.
   In a decision significant for its unanimity, the justices said
the Rev. Jerry Falwell may not collect $200,000 in damages from
publisher Larry Flynt and Hustler magazine for a parody. ...
   There is no question the parody was putrid. It also was painful
for Moral Majority founder Falwell.
   Still, to condemn it because it breaks all boundaries for sleaze
is one thing. To rule it is libelous is another.
   If a public figure cannot prove he has been libeled, he can't
recover damages for even the most extreme embarrassment.
   In this case, that would have meant proving the parody contained
statements known by the author to be false, which could be
considered true. It's impossible to imagine that anyone considered
the parody true.

   Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the Supreme Court parody decision:
   The American democratic system requires that the fullest

   That description applies to the Hustler spoof. Because it could
not have been reasonably interpreted as stating facts about (Jerry)
Falwell, his claim of libel failed. At that point the First
Amendment took over.
   Many of us committed to the First Amendment would feel more
comfortable rallying behind a worthier champion than Hustler
magazine. But great principles of justice can sprout from unseemly
roots.
   The Supreme Court, by extending constitutional protection for
parody and satire, has advanced the cause of freedom.

   The Sun, Westerly, R.I., on the long Supreme Court vacancy:
   Two-thirds of a year have gone by from the time a Supreme Court
vacany occurred until Judge Anthony Kennedy was sworn in ... as the
ninth justice.
   The question whether it was worth the wait will be variously
answered, depending on one's opinion of Kennedy and the prior
nominees who were rejected.
   No one, however, can dispute the assertions that Kennedy was a
compromise candidate after the administration had failed with Judge
Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg.
   The Senate deemed Bork too controversial for his narrow
constitutional stance, Ginsburg not only flawed in character but of
inadequate judicial stature. ...
   Kennedy, in contrast to his predecessors before the Senate in
its process of advice and consent, was readily approved _ perhaps
in part out of relief that a conservative yet not rigidly
doctrinaire nominee was at least offered; but in any case, approved.
   Some liberals, especially women's rights advocates, still have
their doubts about how Justice Kennedy will perform. On the whole,
however, he appears to be an excellent choice. And it is good to
have a full court again after a long hiatus.

   The Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern on educational testing:
   While it is edifying that Wisconsin leads the rest of the nation
on American College Testing (ACT) scores, ... Wisconsin ranks near
the bottom in the percentage of students taking that or the
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).
   That does not mean that the high score is somehow invalid. But
it does suggest that it may be artificially high in comparison to
other states where the average is lower but the percentage of
students taking the test is higher.
   As ratings experts have long counseled: Do not read too much
into the test scores data. It can't be used to prove the quality of
a state's educational product.
   It may point to some extra efforts if the average fluctuates
greatly from one year to the next. But it is not universally taken
and thus there are too many other factors involved in assessing the
quality of education which those tests can not depict.

<TEXT>
   Billions of dollars in bank deposits are being
taken out of Panama for safer havens in the wake of the political
turmoil following the drug indictment of military strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, financial experts say.
   Some of that money has wound up in Miami, where federal
regulations adopted earlier this decade allow ``offshore'' banks to
escape the scrutiny that domestic banks undergo.
   Panama in the 1980s had come to be known as the Switzerland of
Latin America, offering banking secrecy and stability to the
region's investors and depositors. Banks there are unfettered by
high taxes or cumbersome rules, providing a safe haven for both
legitimately and illegitimately earned money.
   But a deposit flight began last year when street demonstrations
broke out in Panama, accelerating after Noriega's indictment last
month.
   ``This certainly has destabilized Panama as a banking center,''
said Gonzalo Valdes-Fauli, senior vice president and manager of the
Miami office of London-based Barclay's Bank.
   Valdes-Fauli said some foreign banks are moving their operations
to other Caribbean or Central American nations.
   Credit Suisse, the third-biggest U.S. bank, announced Tuesday
that it was closing its Panama office at the end of April, and said
its offshore business has already been transferred to branches in
Miami and the Bahamas.
   One unidentified top banking expert told The Miami Herald that
from June to October Panamanian banks lost $7 billion of the $36
billion they held.
   Some of that money began trickling back, but since Noriega's
indictment and the subsequent political upheaval, Panama banks are
losing the funds once more, the Herald reported Wednesday.
   Foreign deposits in Miami increased 39 percent in 1987 to $6.2
billion, although it was not known how much of that represented
deposits from Panama banks.
   The deposit flight from Panama could be accelerated by an
expected State Department notification to U.S. banks not to
transact business with the Central American nation's current
government.

<TEXT>
   A judge has given postal inspectors the
go-ahead to seize mail orders for ``Fat Magnet,'' a pill nationally
advertised as the ``lazy way'' to lose weight.
   U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. issued a preliminary
injunction Tuesday against the company after Assistant U.S.
Attorney George Wu argued it may be fraudulently promoting the
pill, which it claims absorbs fat and flushes it out of the body.
   The pill does not have Federal Drug Administration approval.
   The U.S. Postal Service had requested the injunction, which
allows the postal inspectors to continue seizures they began three
weeks ago. A decision on the charges will be made at an
administrative hearing in Washington, D.C., within 60 days.
   Postal Inspector Jim Harbin said the Postal Service already has
seized between 8,000 and 10,000 pieces of mail addressed to the
company in Beverly Hills and will keep the mail, including checks
for purchase of the product, until a fraud hearing is held.
   Attorneys for Fat Magnet said the product not only works, but is
a food for special dietary use, a category recognized as between
food and drugs that does not require FDA approval.
   ``We certainly agree that this product has not been approved by
the FDA,'' said Kirkpatrick Dilling, a company attorney. ``It's not
necessary.''
   Dilling said the pill's two main ingredients, fiber and purified
bile, do not qualify Fat Magnet as a new, unapproved drug.
   But Wu responded that there are questions about how well Fat
Magnet works, if it works at all, and serious consumer safety
concerns about its use.

<DATELINE>NORTH TARRYTOWN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like Rip Van Winkle, North
Tarrytown has been asleep to its heritage for years, and will
awaken to a new and better life if its name is changed to Sleepy
Hollow, some residents say.
   ``It's a part of history that we're Sleepy Hollow,'' said Chris
Skelly, a member of the Village of Sleepy Hollow Committee. ``It's
not a made-up name. It gives us the potential to be famous because
everyone's heard of Sleepy Hollow.''
   In the Washington Irving story, Sleepy Hollow was the town where
the Headless Horseman rode. Rip Van Winkle, another Irving
character, slept for 20 years in the Catskills.
   Skelly said Irving, for whom nearby Irvington was named, didn't
make up the name, but reached back to 17th century Dutch
descriptions of the area as ``slaeperingh haven'' and ``slaeperingh
hol,'' or sleeping harbor and sleepy hollow. The names meant it was
easy to dock there and spend the night.
   Now, Skelly and others want to bring the Dutch name back to
distinguish North Tarrytown from neighboring Tarrytown and try to
revitalize the village of 8,000 beset by financial and social woes.
   Residents will decide the matter during village elections March
15.
   Opponents of the measure, such as Edna Belanich, a founder of
Concerned Citizens Against Changing the Name of North Tarrytown,
say it would be confusing and costly and wouldn't accomplish
anything.
   ``It'll be a panacea, not a cure,'' she said. ``History will not
pay the bills or solve the problems. We can keep history in our
hearts.''
   Skelly says history can go a long way to attracting new
business, particularly tourism, to the village, which boasts the
Sleepy Hollow cemetery, an old Dutch graveyard, and Philipsburg
Manor, the home of an early English settler.
   ``We are not a suburb of Tarrytown,'' he said. ``We're in
different towns. We have different histories. We are the older,
more historic village and the name should reflect that.''
   A report done by Mayor Janet Gandolfo estimated the cost of the
name change to range as high as almost $40,000, including a new
seal, new badges for police and firefighters and new administrative
costs.
   But Mrs. Belanich said the cost would be higher because it was
difficult to determine hidden expenses.
   ``And it's not necessary,'' she said. ``They think changing the
name will solve our financial problems and the social problems.
They just don't want to be associated with them.''
   The village suffered a major racial disturbance in 1986 when
problems in the Hispanic community brought in officers from several
neighboring communities and led to a countywide evaluation of
Hispanic problems.
   Financially, the village has been running in the red since it
agreed to lower the property tax assessment for the General Motors
plant, which had threatened to sue.
   Originally called Beekmantown, the village became North
Tarrytown in 1874, three years after Tarrytown was incorporated.
   Skelly said North Tarrytown felt threatened by the town of Mount
Pleasant, so it aligned itself with Tarrytown.
   ``Now we're just Tarrytown's poor relation. We don't get enough
attention and we deserve it because we're world-famous,'' said
Skelly. ``It's a very powerful name and image. It's a potential
gold mine.''

<HEAD>New Home Sales Down 9 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New home sales fell 9 percent in January,
pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the
last recession, the government said Wednesday as the housing
industry continued to stagger following the October stock market
collapse.
   A downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset
of a recession, but analysts said they believed falling mortgage
rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months.
   In January, the Commerce Department said that sales of new
single-family homes fell for the third consecutive month, dropping
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units, 26 percent
below a year ago and the slowest pace since the last recession was
ending in December 1982.
   In a second lackluster economic report, the Commerce Department
said orders for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January to a
seasonally adjusted $212.6 billion.
   While this was the first decline in five months, analysts noted
that it followed an unusually large 2 percent December increase, a
gain which reflected a big jump in demand for jet airplanes.
   Analysts said the one-month setback did nothing to change their
view that American manufacturers are continuing to enjoy a sales
boom led by increased demand for exports.
   Analysts said they were surprised by the sharpness of the
decline in home sales, especially since sales had already fallen by
6.8 percent in December and 3.4 percent in November.
   The decline in new home sales followed other reports showing a
big decline in construction starts for new homes in January and the
third consecutive monthly decrease in sales of existing homes.
   ``It looks like housing is bearing the brunt of the stock market
decline, but I believe lower interest rates can solve a lot of
problems in this industry,'' said Bob Villanueva, director of
economic forecasting for the National Association of Home Builders.
   Analysts noted that fixed-rate mortgages have fallen into the
single-digit range again, averaging 9.87 percent last week,
compared to 10.6 percent when the year began.
   James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said with ``mortgage rates moving in the right
direction'' sales for all of 1988 should rebound to around 650,000
units, only 3 percent below the 1987 sales pace.
   But other analysts said it remained to be seen whether the drop
in mortgage rates will be enough to attract new buyers. They noted
that sales have been strong for the past three years and a lot of
pent-up demand has been exhausted.
   ``We simply don't have the demand for housing that we had in the
first part of the recovery,'' said Michael Sumichrast, an economist
and publisher of a construction industry newsletter. ``The South,
which accounts for almost half of all new homes sold, is still weak
and you won't see any significant improvement until that area turns
around.''
   Analysts, however, said they were not ready to forecast an end
to the current economic recovery.
   ``We are seeing a shift away from economic growth driven by
housing and other domestic sectors and toward growth in
manufacturing and other export sectors,'' said Warren Lasko,
executive director of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The 9 percent decline in new home sales in January was the
steepest decline since a 10.9 percent drop last May. The big
decline in sales was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices.
   The median, or mid-point, price of a home shot up 9.7 percent to
$120,000 while the average home price rose to $149,000, an increase
of 10.5 percent.
   Economists said that while home prices have been outpacing rises
in overall inflation in recent months, the January surge was skewed
upward by the fact that sales rose in the Northeast, a high-priced
section of the country, while they were down sharply in the
less-expensive South.
   Sales dropped 24.4 percent in the South to an annual rate of
177,000 units. Sales were off 13.7 percent in the Midwest to a rate
of 88,000 units.
   Sales rose 23 percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of
91,000 units, but this big increase followed a much larger 53
percent December decline. Sales edged up 0.6 percent in the West to
an annual rate of 179,000 units.

<HEAD>Fallen Stone Causes Political Furor Over Antiquities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The falling of a piece of rock from
the crumbling body of the Sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate
over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and Egypt's other
ancient treasures.
   The principal casualty of the uproar has been Ahmed Kadry,
formerly chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni, of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly
on Kadry's stewardship of the Sphinx and the other relics of
Egypt's rich past. Hosni did not reply to the accusation.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb.
7, six days after a sandstorm buffeted Giza Plateau.
   A restoration plan is in the works. The Sphinx has been fitted
with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early
stages of the effort, and a committee of experts has taken rock
samples for analysis to help decide what steps to take.
   The Sphinx, which is 66 feet high and 160 feet long, has the
head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion. Many
Egyptologists think the face is that of Chephren, son of Cheops and
builder of the second pyramid on Giza Plateau next to Cheops' Great
Pyramid.
   A similiar accident six years ago brought down Kadry's
predecessor, Fouad Oraby, and a Sphinx-restoration project that
Kadry began as antiquities chairman remained unfinished when the
latest rock fell.
   Zahi Hawass, general director of the pyramids area and
archaeology adviser to Hosni, will direct the latest restoraton and
conservation efforts.
   The earliest restoration of the Sphinx began 3,600 years ago.
   ``Two hundred years from now all our monuments will be
finished,'' Hawass told The Associated Press.
   ``In the past the monuments were safe from many factors that
destroy them because they were buried in the sand. The monuments
were not subjected to pollution, the environment, tourists, the
things that are ruining them now.''
   The emergency work on the Sphinx should be finished by late
March, with fallen pieces of limestone replaced and weak places
beneath the neck and shoulders treated, Hawass said. Made of weaker
limestone than other parts, the neck long has been considered a
chronic problem.
   After the emergency work, experts will draw up an overall
restoration plan, Hawass said.
   A major problem, said Omar el-Arini, Cairo representative of the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, is that previous
restorers have not learned why the Sphinx continues to decay.
   ``In a nutshell, we have been looking at symptoms of the
problems, not the problems themselves,'' he said.
   ``We have been treating it as a rock carved 4,600 years ago, but
the limestone is 40 million years old. Our approach should be to
look at an object of 40 million years.''
   One of the problems facing the team will be how to rid the
monument of salt, which is visible on many portions of the body.
   Shawky Nakhla, chief restorer for the Antiquity Organization,
said restoration efforts in the 1940s and 1950s added to the
Sphinx's salt problem.
   ``They used cement, and a lot of salt started appearing,'' he
said. ``We don't know if a high water table level below the Sphinx
is a real cause of the salt problems, or whether the salt is coming
out of the limestone itself.''

   Pat Robertson won a one-sided
preference poll victory in Alaska's Republican caucuses, nearly
doubling the support given Vice President George Bush, party
officials said today.
   Robertson, the former television evangelist, claimed 47 percent
of the votes compared with Bush's 24 percent in a poll of 2,020
precinct delegates. Sen. Bob Dole took third with 20 percent.
   The preference poll was not binding, though it gave an
indication of the feelings of the delegates who will attend 27 GOP
district conventions March 18-26. At those meetings, 400 delegates
will be chosen to attend the state convention in late April, when
the state's 19 GOP delegates will be named to attend the national
convention.
   A hint of Robertson's strength was suggested Tuesday when party
spokesman Linda Shafer noted that Republican regulars had noticed
new faces in the precinct caucuses that began Saturday.
   In other early-contest states, Robertson supporters have signed
up thousands of new party members to participate in caucuses.
   ``There were people new to the political process,'' said Shafer.
``You could tell by their political platforms _ things like
anti-marijuana and anti-abortion _ that they were church folks.''
   Many of the delegates had been expected to back Robertson,
Shafer said. But Robertson had competition on the religious front.
A Baptist preacher, the Rev. Jerry Prevo, organized members of his
Anchorage church to attend the caucuses and support Bush.
   The caucuses were open to any registered Republican.
   Precinct and district delegates have been known to shift
allegiances, but the GOP delegates to the national conventions
never have abandoned their chosen candidates, state Republican
chairman Jim Crawford said.
   Crawford said the Alaska GOP is trying to link up with other
Western states in hopes of gaining clout, especially in selecting a
vice presidential candidate.
   The Democratic Party's delegate selection, similar to that of
the Republican Party, is scheduled to begin in Alaska with precinct
caucuses in 10 days.

<TEXT>
   Here are capsule profiles of some of the
major figures in Gov. Evan Mecham's impeachment trial:
   
   FRANK X. GORDON Jr. _ Chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court
and presiding officer in the Senate trial. Democrat, a self-styled
moderate, 59; described as the epitome of a small town lawyer and
judge, friendly, open, straight-forward. Scored 100 percent for
integrity in a poll of 300 Arizona attorneys in 1986. Arizona's
youngest Superior Court judge when he was appointed to that bench
in May 1962. Born in Chicago in 1929, came to Arizona with his
parents as a child. Graduate of Stanford University in 1951,
received law degree from the University of Arizona in 1954. Kingman
city attorney in 1955-56. Appointed to the state Supreme Court in
1975 by then-Gov. Raul Castro. Became chief justice in 1987.
   
   WILLIAM P. FRENCH _ Lead prosecution attorney. Hired by the
House in October to investigate Mecham's $350,000 campaign loan and
other allegations. French, 56, presented a report on Jan. 15
outlining possible grounds of impeachment and conducted the
subsequent hearings that led to the Feb. 5 impeachment. Former
presiding judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court's criminal
division. Worked for the U.S. Justice Department as a prosecutor in
the organized crime section.
   
   JERRIS LEONARD _ Hired one week before the impeachment trial
began to head Mecham's defense team. Accustomed to defending
controversial people, but forced to resign from his Washington,
D.C., law firm because it didn't want to be involved in
representing Mecham. Former head of the Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration and the Justice Department's civil rights division
under President Nixon. Former Wisconsin Senate majority leader.
Leonard, 57, headed United Sciences of America, a company accused
by the New York state attorney general of engaging in an illegal
pyramid-type scheme to sell vitamins. The company agreed to a
financial settlement in October.
   
   FRED CRAFT _ A Mecham friend and the subject of two major
disputes between Mecham and the Legislature in 1987. Mecham wanted
to hire him as the governor's Washington, D.C., lobbyist, but the
Legislature refused to appropriate the money. Mecham eventually
decided to hire Craft anyway and paid his salary and expenses from
the governor's office budget. Mecham also was accused of pressuring
a state panel to choose Craft as its lobbyist for Arizona's bid for
the federal superconducting super collider. The panel eventually
chose another lobbyist. Craft resigned as Arizona's Washington
lobbyist shortly after impeachment turned the governorship over to
Arizona's secretary and state and forced Mecham to step aside as
governor at least temporarily. Craft ad Leonard are longtime
friends, and Craft brought Leonard into the impeachment trial.
   
   RALPH MILSTEAD _ The man Mecham is accused of ordering not to
cooperate with the state attorney general's investigation of a
death threat allegation. Director of the Department of Public
Safety since 1980. Given a new five-year contract in 1985.
Previously spent 20 years in the Phoenix Police Department,
reaching the rank of major. Mecham has been rumored at various
times to have wanted to replace Milstead, 48, but by law he cannot
be fired at will by the governor.
   
   DONNA CARLSON _ Mecham's former special assistant and liaison to
the Legislature. A former state senator and unsuccessful
congressional candidate. She resigned in October 1987, saying the
controversy surrounding Mecham's administration had made it
impossible for her to do her job. Ms. Carlson, 50, was scheduled to
testify before the state grand jury regarding Mecham's failure to
report a $350,000 campaign loan when she allegedl became the
subject of a death threat by then-state official Lee Watkins.
   
   PEGGY GRIFFITH _ The woman who reported then-state official
Watkins had voiced threats to the life of Carlson. Mrs. Griffith is
director of the Governor's Office of Women's Services. She told the
Department of Public Safety on Nov. 13 that Watkins had told her
her friend, Ms. Carlson, had better keep quiet or Ms. Carlson might
go on a ``long boat ride'' and not come back. Mrs. Griffith earlier
had been close friends with Ms. Carlson, but Ms. Carlson said the
two had become somewhat distant at the time the alleged death
threat was made.

   A state Health Department study indicated about
one in every 116 women giving birth in New York state carried the
AIDS virus, far higher than the 1 in 476 results in a similar
Massachusetts study.
   The New York study, conducted in November, showed 161 positive
tests from 18,700 infants examined in the state. In New York City,
there were 148 positive test results from 9,000 infants examined _
a rate of one in 61. The figure was even higher in the city's
poorer neighborhoods, with a figure of one in 43 in the Bronx.
   An infant's immune system reflects its mother's system. An
infant testing positive for the presence of AIDS antibodies almost
always got the virus through an infected mother.
   The Massachusetts study found that one of every 476 women giving
birth, or 2.1 for each 1,000, were infected with the AIDS virus. At
three inner-city Boston hospitals, eight per 1,000 were infected _
a rate of one per 125 births.

<HEAD>How Delvalle the Meek Became Delvalle the Martyr</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week ago Eric Arturo Delvalle was reviled as
a figurehead president of Panama whose chief purpose was to provide
a democratic fig leaf to the military forces who ran the country.
   Now Delvalle the Meek has become Delvalle the Martyr. In the
Reagan administration's view, he could become a Panamanian version
of Philippines President Corazon Aquino, the lightning rod for
Democratic opposition to former Philippines President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Much of the Reagan administration's strategy toward Panama over
the past few days has been built around Delvalle and his claim to
be Panama's constitutional president.
   He is an integral part of the U.S. ``chipmunk strategy'' toward
Panama. The State Department wants to keep gnawing at Panama's
economy, at military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega's claim to
legitimacy and his support at home and abroad.
   Noriega is the chieftain of Panama's armed forces, and,
according to a federal indictment handed up in Miami, a cocaine
smuggler.
   Eventually, in the administration's hopes, Noriega will find his
hold on power has evaporated and pack up.
   In defying Noriega and ordering him stripped of power, Devalle
provided a democratic symbol around whom Panamanians could rally.
   Delvalle's image as a powerless front man dates back to when he
took office in the fall of 1985. Noriega was unhappy with the
president at the time, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, because of an
independent streak, and he forced Barletta from office.
   Delvalle was sworn in as president under the most unpromising of
circumstances. In effect, he had to behave according to Noriega's
wishes or he would end up like Barletta. He carried that burden for
two years.
   A mystique has developed around Delvalle since he tried to fire
Noriega and wound up out of office himself. Rather than flee the
country after his dismissal, he went into hiding, issuing
proclamations to his countrymen, making videotaped messages and
frustrating efforts by Noriega's forces to locate him.
   One of his chief allies these days is Gabriel Lewis, a former
ambassador to Washington who is now a captain of the anti-Noriega
campaign in exile.
   To hear Lewis tell it, Delvalle had wanted to break with Noriega
for five months but was reluctant to do so because of ``confusing''
signals from Washington.
   Lewis says Noriega has been suspicious of Delvalle's intentions
for some time and kept telling the president, ``Don't act against
me because the gringos are behind me.''
   This was based on what Noriega felt were reassuring visits by
emissaries from Washington, including Assistant Defense Secretary
Richard Armitage.
   A turning point occurred in early January, Lewis said, when
Panamanian opposition leaders gathered in Miami and Delvalle sent
an envoy.
   ``The emissary told us that if we gave him (Delvalle) assurances
that we would support him, he was ready to act and dismiss
Noriega,'' Lewis said.
   ``We sent him back a message,'' Lewis said. He said the message
was: ``We have heard that many times. We want deeds and not words.
If you fire Noriega and his cronies, we will give you support.''
   Contacts with Lewis and other Noriega opponents continued, with
some messages being passed by Delvalle's dentist in Florida.
Another turning point took place in early February when two Florida
grand juries charged that Noriega was a key figure in an
international drug smuggling ring.
   With an end to the ambiguity in Washington's position, the
opposition front suggested that Delvalle travel to Washington to
announce his break with Noriega before the Organization of American
States.
   Delvalle agreed, but had second thoughts. He reasoned that
firing Noriega at OAS headquarters in Washington might be seen ``as
acting on instructions from the United States,'' Lewis said.
   But was Delvalle getting cold feet?
   At Lewis' instigation, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called
Delvalle to give him encouragement. On Feb. 17, Delvalle was in
Miami and invited Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams to
visit him.
   If Delvalle was ousted for trying to fire Noriega, Abrams
assured him, the United States would support him as Panama's
constitutional president, Lewis said.
   Eight days later, in an important moment in Panama's tumultuous
history, Delvalle acted.

<HEAD>Filmmakers Agree to Trim Ethnic Slur From Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Oliver Stone and producer Edward
Pressman have agreed to trim a slur against Puerto Ricans from the
home video version of ``Wall Street'' following complaints from the
Hispanic community.
   State Sen. Olga Mendez said Wednesday the comment during
dialogue between actors Charlie Sheen and Sylvia Miles will be
missing when the movie is released on video.
   ``It took just a week for negotiations to remove it,'' said
Mendez. ``It shows very clearly they are very sensitive to people's
feelings.''
   According to Mendez, ex-deputy mayor Kenneth Lipper acted as
mediator in the negotiations to remove the line in question.
Lipper, who also served as a technical advisor to the film, said
the line was included to demonstrate the greed and bigotry of the
Miles' character, a real estate agent.
   In the box office hit, Sheen is trying to sell his New York
apartment. Miles, explaining that will be no easy task, tells him,
``The only things moving in New York are Puerto Ricans and
cockroaches.''
   Pressman, in a letter to Mendez, agreed to trim the comment.
   ``As you know, Oliver Stone and I are identified with such
progressive films as `The Revolutionary,' `Walker,' `Salvador' and
`Platoon,''' he wrote.

   A man who has been on the lam for nearly
four years with a pair of 3{-ton elephants says he'll come in from
the cold if he is assured that Tory and Duchess will not be
returned to two men he alleges brutalized them.
   Arlan Seidon raised the Indian elephants from infancy and then
sold them to Edward Drake. In May 1984, he and the 7-foot-high
beasts disappeared in a tractor-trailer.
   He surfaced last week when he called a newspaper from an
undisclosed location to say he'd surrender if guaranteed that the
elephants will not be returned to Drake and his father, Richard.
   ``I want to make sure where they are going to. I don't feel that
I'm going to spend this much time trying to protect them so they
end up back with the Drakes,'' Seidon told The Star-Ledger of
Newark.
   ``I know I sound like a crazy old man but I'm not,'' he said.
   The elephants' owners and the president of a national animal
trainers group say the animals were not harmed, and both sides
accuse each other of lacking an elephant-like memory about the
incident.
   Edward Drake says Seidon sold him the elephants for $80,000 in
1981, when the Drakes owned an exotic animal ranch in Tehachapi,
Calif., about 200 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Drake said Tuesday that Seidon acted as his booking agent for
animal shows after the sale but began cheating, taking money and
finally the elephants while a circus was in New Jersey.
   Seidon told The Star-Ledger he exercised the terms of the sale
contract by repossessing the elephants when the Drakes fell behind
in their payments.
   While waiting for money at a Colts Neck Township farm, Seidon
said, he discovered the animals had wounds caused by hooks piercing
their skin during training. On May 4, 1984, after a Superior Court
judge in Monmouth County ordered the elephants returned, he fled
with them.
   His attorney, Estelle Strauss, said Tuesday her client never
stole money and that he only wanted to help Tory and Duchess.
   ``The elephants' condition was never aired at the trial,'' said
Ms. Strauss. ``He had an agreement that he could repossess the
animals if they were abused. His position has not changed.''
   But Edward Drake, who like his father is now out of the animal
business, said Seidon's story about the elephants' treatment is
``so far-fetched it's unbelievable.''
   John Cuneo, president of the Illinois-based National Congress of
Animal Trainers and Breeders, said the Drakes did not abuse their
animals. ``They had beautiful elephants. I even wanted to buy
one,'' he said.
   Cuneo said anyone concerned about an animal's condition can
alert state, federal and private monitoring authorities.
   Seidon has forsaken his Fordland, Mo., farm and his career
preparing animals for circus and television appearances to care for
his 25-year-old elephants, who eat about 200 pounds of hay a day.
   Ms. Strauss said she does not know where or how Seidon conceals
the elephants. He calls her periodically to check on his case, she
said.
   She said he would come forward to face criminal charges _
third-degree theft carrying a sentence of up to five years in
prison, a $100,000 fine or both _ if he wins a safe haven for the
elephants. The attorney filed a court motion last week to overturn
the judgment awarding the animals to the Drakes.
   County Assistant Prosecutor Alton Kenney said he was not ready
to discuss any deals for Seidon and had not heard from Ms. Strauss.

   The Communist Party said Wednesday a
sweeping political purge of two decades ago showed ``manifestations
of anti-Semitism,'' but it added that most party members took no
part in the religious bias.
   More than 9,000 Jews lost official positions in the 1968
``anti-Zionist'' purge, and an estimated 12,000-20,000 emigrated,
more than half the Jews then living in Poland.
   The acknowledgement of anti-Semitism by the party newspaper
Trybuna Ludu carried the authority of an official statement. It
also was repeated by the state-run news agency PAP and reported
prominently on state TV and radio.
   But one leader of the 1968 student protests which sparked the
purge said the newspaper's article did not go far enough in its
condemnation of anti-Semitism and that it repeated past slanders
against Jews.
   It ``amounts to drawing wool over people's eyes,'' said Adam
Michnik, a writer and prominent leader of Poland's anti-government
opposition.
   The article in Trybuna Ludu, the official daily of the Polish
United Workers (Communist) Party, was timed to coincide with the
20th anniversary of the 1968 ``events.''
   Discrimination against Jews, in the guise of ``anti-Zionism''
which had begun after the June 1967 Israeli victory in the Middle
East war, accelerated sharply after March 1968 student
demonstrations around the country against censorship.
   The purge, which began within the party, soon spread to the
government, army, academia, press and other official institutions,
   The newspaper said some conservative, nationalist party factions
at the time ``took advantage of the Jewish ancestry'' of their
political rivals.
   ``They did not realize then that they were being manipulated by
various political factions which in different ways made use of
their actions.''
   Some Western histories have charged that students were provoked
by conservative factions using them to provide a pretext for a
purge.
   Poland was home to about 3.5 million Jews before the war, who
represented about 10 percent of the population. Estimates vary, but
the number of Jews in the country now is believed to be between
7,000 and 15,000.
   Explaining the origins of the anti-Semitism, Trybuna Ludu
referred to support of Israel expressed by some Polish Jews after
the 1967 war and prominent roles held by Jews during the Stalinist
period of the late 1940s to early 1950s.
   ``Polish people preserved the memory of unlawful conduct, of
violation of law and order, and of the perpetrators of those
offenses. It was easy in 1968 to use that memory as a background
for presenting the `alien ... group' as the source of all evil,''
it said.
   But the article added that these explanations ``by no means''
could excuse anti-Semitic acts in Poland.
   Michnik, referring to the explanations, said, ``All the
obscenities of the March (1968) propaganda campaign have been
repeated, all of them. What has been done is nothing but
cosmetics.''
   A leading party theoretician and journalist, Ludwik Krasucki,
said Tuesday on Polish TV that the party's attempts to reconsider
the history of the period were vital.
   He expressed hope that by thoroughly reexamining the 1968
events, ``this chapter, which nevertheless can't be forgotten,
shall once and for all be closed.''

   Negotiators on Wednesday launched their latest and
possibly last round of Afghanistan peace talks, and the U.N.
mediator said he was confident of forging a settlement to end
Soviet involvement in the country.
   ``This was a good session,'' Pakistan's acting foreign minister,
Zain Noorani, said as he emerged from the first closed-door meeting
late Wednesday. ``We are cautiously optimistic.''
   Pakistan is representing the Afghan guerrillas in the talks.
   Afghanistan's foreign minister, Abdul Wakil, told reporters that
his meeting with mediator Diego Cordovez was ``very nice.''
   Cordovez has been the go-between since the indirect negotiations
began nearly six years ago. Because Pakistan refuses to recognize
Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government, the delegations sit in
separate rooms, with Cordovez shuttling back and forth.
   Before the talks opened, Cordovez told reporters he believed
both sides had the ``political will'' to work out an agreement.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced last month that if
a settlement were signed by March 15, the withdrawal of an
estimated 115,000 Red Army troops from Afghanistan could begin by
May 15.
   The Soviets intervened in 1979 to back the Kabul government in
its war with Moslem guerrillas.
   Pakistan wants any settlement to be accompanied by formation of
a transitional government, replacing the present one headed by
President Najib.
   It argues that only a broad-based government could prevent new
bloodshed in a country where war has already claimed more than a
million lives.
   Cordovez said the new talks would ``last as long as necessary''
to reach an agreement and added, ``Perhaps it will be signed
earlier than you think.''
   He said some ``difficult'' problems remained but said he was
sure they could be resolved soon.
   Cordovez didn't say what those problems were, but reports have
suggested they focus on the timetable for the Soviet withdrawal and
the timing of the cutoff of military aid to the warring sides.
   The United States last year gave an estimated $700 million worth
of military assistance to the 200,000 insurgents fighting the
Soviets and the smaller Afghan forces.
   Noorani said Pakistan will decide next week whether it is
prepared to sign a settlement with the present Afghan leadership.
The decision will come after consultations Sunday between Prime
Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo and political leaders, including
those from opposition groups.
   Pakistan has argued that under current conditions, the more than
3 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and another 2 million in Iran
could not return home.
   Cordovez said, ``Civil strife is part of the way of life
there,'' and he said there was a ``posibility'' that it would
continue. But he added that he believed that the ``people of
Afghanistan are tired of this conflict, that they want peace.''
   Cordovez said he had been in contact with representatives of
several countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union,
the European Community and Australia, to discuss humanitarian aid
to Afghanistan after a settlement.
   ``I have the feeling that there will be a broad international
effort,'' he said.
   The sense of optimism was not shared by Iran, which is not
participating in the talks. Tehran has refused to participate as
long as the Moslem resistance is not invited.
   Iranian ambassador Sirous Nasseri told reporters that Iran
attaches ``no significance to the settlement as it is being
forumulated here.'' He said the main problems were related to
formation of a government acceptable to all Afghans and the phasing
of the Soviet pullout.
   ``I doubt very much that this could be solved here,'' he said.

   Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer is testing his
influence by backing a candidate to take his old seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives, but so far his favorite is running no
better than second.
   State Sen. Foster Campbell, the front-runner in the field of 10,
says he has not worried about Roemer's endorsement of Stan Tiner,
former editor of the Shreveport Journal.
   ``I'm just trying to see folks and I'm taking it day by day,''
said Campbell, a Democrat.
   If no candidate wins a majority of the non-partisan vote on
March 8, a runoff between the top two would be held on April 16.
   The winner will fill Roemer's unexpired term and faces
re-election this fall. Roemer resigned the seat effective March 14,
the day he takes office as governor, replacing Edwin Edwards.
   The field also includes state Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, who
lost the seat to Roemer in 1980 after one term during which he was
acquitted of charges in a vote-buying scandal. Leach later returned
to the state House but lost a race last year for state treasurer.
   The other candidates include Jim McCrery, the lone Republican
and formerly Roemer's top aide; June Phillips, an administrator at
Southern University-Shreveport and the only black in the race;
Mayor Gene Byars of Minden; Shreveport lawyers Troy Bain and
Marshall Jones; Charles Martin, a retired Shreveport businessman;
and Mitchell E. Marsh, a fencing contractor from Mansfield.
   Recent polls by the Journal and joint polls by the Shreveport
Times and KSLA-TV have shown Campbell ahead. In the Journal poll
published Feb. 19, Campbell had the support of 26 percent, followed
by Tiner with 16 percent and McCrery and Leach close behind.
   The Times-KSLA poll released on Feb. 26 had Tiner running third,
five points behind Leach.
   Campbell, a state senator since 1976, would not predict who
would be in the runoff with him.
   ``Whoever I'm in a runoff with, I can beat,'' he said.
   Roemer, who insists he hasn't formally endorsed anyone, recently
appeared at a fundraiser for Tiner and gave him a campaign
contribution.
   ``That's it,'' Roemer said of his efforts. ``I said publicly,
the truth. `Who am I going to vote for?' I said Stan Tiner. We're
20-year friends.
   ``But frankly, I've got other friends in that race. June
Phillips, great person. Jim McCrery, great person. I'm leaving five
people out and I shouldn't have gotten into this.''

<HEAD>Harvard Woman Challenges Exclusivity of All-Male Clubs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard student who contends she is
being excluded from the breeding grounds of power is challenging
the membership policies of nine exclusive all-male student clubs.
   In her complaint before Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination, Lisa J. Schkolnick argues that the Fly and eight
other ``final clubs'' may be violating state laws prohibiting
sexual discrimination in public institutions by refusing to admit
women.
   Schkolnick said in a recent interview that she picked the Fly at
random as the target of her suit, and considers it representative
of the other clubs. The commission, a quasi-legal entity, has the
power to investigate cases, award damages, and seek injuctions.
   The clubhouses are located in some of the most expensive real
estate holdings in and around Harvard Square, discreetly shielded
by tall hedges and unmarked doors. Some have separate entraces for
women visitors.
   They were originally called final clubs to distinguish them from
waiting clubs _ less exclusive, now extinct organizations. Evolving
from fraternities to eating clubs in the past century, they became
social meeting places by the 1950s. Past members have included both
Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt and several members of the Kennedy
clan.
   Harvard formally severed ties to the clubs in 1984, after
members refused a university demand to admit women. But
Schkolnick's case rests on the argument that the clubs remain an
integral part of student life and cannot be considered private.
   The issue has become a major topic of debate on campus.
   The undergraduate student council last week narrowly rejected a
proposal to endorse Schkolnik's cause, but voted to reimburse $250
in office costs to a lawyer who offered to help her without a fee.
   Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz expressed moral support,
urging council members to back Schkolnick.
   ``I think it's the first major challenge to what have been very
entrenched institutions at Harvard,'' Dershowitz said in an
interview. ``These finals clubs are the minor leagues for the power
clubs in the major cities, the all-male ones.''
   Dershowitz, a former Yale student, compared the clubs to Yale
groups ``so secret I didn't even know about them until I
graduated,'' and to Princeton University's two remaining all-male
eating clubs, now appealing a state order to admit women.
   Barbara Bolten, vice president of public relations in the Boston
chapter of the National Organization for Women said, ``We support
the philosophy of what she's doing totally, and I hope she wins.''
   Schkolnick, a 21-year-old philosophy senior from Princeton,
N.J., said she was the target of a rash of crank calls, ``some
obscene, others frightening,'' for several weeks after she filed
her complaint Dec. 14.
   She suggested that the clubs serve as old-boy networks to the
detriment of women.
   ``These are power centers, and these people are being fed into
powerful positions, and women are being excluded,'' she said. ``I'm
going to be a lawyer one day, and I could have used some of these
positions that members are exposed to.''
   The clubs, in turn, deny that their members gain undue advantage
through networking and argue they are strictly private
organizations which should be allowed to decide on membership.
   ``There are some people in the clubs established in business,
but it's definitely not an institutionalized process through which
you secure interviews through alumni,'' said Stan Novak, former
president of the Fox final club.
   Novak, who graduated last year, was the only one of several
final club members polled on the controversy willing to go on the
record. Judith Malone, a lawyer retained by the Fly, declined
comment.
   The clubs do not publicize their membership rolls. But several
students estimated that more than 10 percent of Harvard's
undergraduate males belong. Total undergraduate enrollment is about
6,400.
   Novak said membership didn't help him in his job search.
   ``The fact that after being president for a year, I was still
sitting around from June till Jan. 1, that will give you an idea
about ... how effective alumni ties are,'' said Novak, of
Barrington, R.I.

<HEAD>Court Urged To Block States From Seizing Inmates' Federal Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged on Wednesday to
block states from recouping the costs of keeping criminals behind
bars by seizing money which prison inmates receive in federal
benefits.
   Lawyers representing the Reagan administration and a former
prison inmate attacked an Arkansas law that let authorities seize
for state use an inmate's Social Security or Veterans
Administration benefits.
   They said the law, similar to those enacted in four other
states, conflicts with federal laws specificially barring any legal
action aimed at diverting benefits away from designated recipients.
   ``Congress could have made an exception for state institutional
care,'' argued Justice Department lawyer Richard J. Lazarus. ``But
Congress has not done so here. In our view, that is simply the end
of the issue.''
   Thomas M. Carpenter, a Little Rock lawyer representing former
state prison inmate George Bennett, also contended that the
Arkansas law ``must fall.''
   The issue before the high court is not whether those inmates
with available money may be charged for their imprisonment but
whether states may get at money the inmates receive in federal
benefits.
   The impact of the justices' decision, expected by July, has been
blunted somewhat by laws passed by Congress in 1980 and 1983
withholding or limiting benefits otherwise due imprisoned felons.
   The justices asked few questions, and what had been scheduled as
a hour-long argument session was over in 35 minutes.
   Bennett had served 11 years of a 21-year sentence at a Pine
Bluff prison for second-degree murder when he turned 62. He started
receiving $275 a month in Social Security retirement benefits.
Bennett was released from prison in late 1984 but is seeking to
recover $3,600 in benefits confiscated by the state.
   The Arkansas Legislature in 1981 had passed an Inmate Care and
Custody Reimbursement Act. Under it, state authorities may seek
court approval to seize an inmate's estate _ income from any source.
   Similar laws have been enacted in Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and
Tennessee.
   Reagan administration lawyers had told the justices in briefs
submitted previously that the rationale used by the Arkansas
Supreme Court in upholding the 1981 state law ``would seem to
validate the attachment of Social Security and VA benefits paid to
persons confined in state mental hospitals or in other institutions
where they are provided care by the state.''
   They said it is important for the Arkansas law to be invalidated
so the growing number of states asking prison inmates to help foot
the bill of their imprisonment will not seize federal benefits.
   Arkansas Attorney General Steve Clark told the justices
Wednesday that Arkansas merely was trying to prevent ``windfall
benefits'' for prison inmates who receive their food, clothing and
medical care at state expense.
   Clark said Congress' intent of protecting people ``from the
rigors of poverty'' was ``not frustrated by the Arkansas statute at
all.''
   Responding to Clark's contention that the state had not
``created any kind of hardship,'' Carpenter said his client could
make good use of the money wrongly withheld from him.
   Carpenter described Bennett as ``a 69-year-old man who can't get
a job'' and who would be destitute if he had not been cared for by
relatives.
   The case is Bennett vs. Arkansas, 86-6124.

<TEXT>
   A nine-day sit-in by minority students at
Hampshire College ended Wednesday with the signing of a 16-point
agreement designed to encourage racial harmony at the small private
school.
   ``The acceptance of our demands by the administration is both an
acknowledgment of institutional indifference and neglect and of the
immediate need for redress,'' Anita Fearman, a spokeswoman for the
protesters, told a gathering of 150 students.
   The group watched as college President Adele Simmons and two
other administrators signed the document outside the dormitory
office occupied by an estimated 40 protesters since Feb. 23.
   The six-page settlement provided for a dean of multicultural
affairs, an adviser for the group that occupied Dakin House office
and at least $4,500 in yearly funding for the group.
   The adminstration also agreed to take no disciplinary action
against the students and to allow them to make up work they missed
during the sit-in.
   ``I think the institution won,'' Simmons said after the signing.
``For the last several years we've been working to improve student
life and this represents a finishing of the old agenda.
   ``A number of the things they asked for were already in place,
but I think the occupation strengthened the institution,'' she said.
   Dean of Students Trey Williams said the occupation had taken a
toll on many at the liberal arts school, where about 100 of the
1,100 students are minorities.
   ``The students are exhausted, the president is sick. But it's
better that it took us only one week than forever,'' he said.
   The occupation was prompted by what students described as the
school's longstanding indifference to their concerns.
   ``They were claiming this is a multiculturally diverse
community, which isn't true,'' said protester Penny Predmas.
   College officials said the allegation was a surprise, given the
school's image as a progressive alternative to the sort of
traditional liberal arts education offered at nearby Amherst, Mount
Holyoke and Smith colleges. Hampshire students design their own
courses of study and graduate after passing three divisional
examinations requiring them to complete individual research
projects and some classwork.
   ``We're way in front in transforming curriculum to be much more
global,'' said Faculty Dean Penina Glazer, ``but we're lagging in
recruiting of minority students and we're trying as hard as we
can.''
   The agreement came two weeks after the end of an occupation at
nearby University of Massachusetts that was sparked by campus
racial violence. That takeover ended when Chancellor Joseph Duffey
agreed to increase funding of minority student programs and other
demands.
   A university disciplinary hearing began Tuesday into allegations
that five white male students assaulted two black male students on
Feb. 7, said spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.
   Protesters at Hampshire said racial violence is rare on their
campus, but said there have been several instances of harassment
and discrimination since a cross was found burning on a building
lawn 11 years ago.
   The protesters said, however, that the sympathy shown them by
students and faculty during the occupation had changed their minds
about warning minorities away from the school.
   ``I really would tell them to come here,'' said Predmas.
   A few white students watching the signing ceremony said they
supported the protesters' aims, but disagreed over the wisdom of
occupying the dormitory office.
   ``There basically was a lot of friction,'' said Paul Trunnell.
``The feeling was, `Either you're in or out. Either you support us
or you don't.' Well, no two of us agreed on this campus, but it's
important that we band together to solve these sorts of problems.''

   Vice President George Bush called
himself ``the most stable'' candidate Wednesday, crediting himself
with good judgment that sets him apart in the presidential race.
   ``You want steadiness. You want judgment. You want even
temperament,'' Bush said. He added that a president ``can't make
these outrageous claims.''
   Bush didn't elaborate, but in recent days he has disputed rival
GOP candidate Pat Robertson's contentions concerning Soviet
missiles in Cuba, Robertson's knowledge of U.S. hostage whereabouts
in Lebanon and the possibility the Bush campaign tried to hurt
Robertson by manipulating the timing of allegations against TV
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   In a much-publicized Iowa flap one month ago, a Bush aide
questioned Dole's temperament, calling him ``mean-spirited.''
   Bush commented Wednesday after seeing U.S. Navy warships in
drydock at the Ingalls Shipyard here. He was accompanied by former
Navy Secretary John Lehman.
   The vice president told the shipyard workers that Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis wanted to reduce the number of Navy
battleships. Bush called that ``a dumb idea.''
   Beginning his day in Clearwater, Fla., Bush talked of his five
children _ including Florida Secretary of Commerce Jeb Bush _ and
10 grandchildren, and also said his support of prayer in the
schools is of long standing.
   ``They ought to take a look at my family and what I epitomize in
this regard,'' Bush told reporters.
   Bush also served boiled crawfish at a small rally in Biloxi,
Miss., spoke briefly to supporters at the Mobile, Ala., airport and
planned to participate in a Cajun feast in Baton Rouge, La., before
heading to Greenville, S.C.
   At the shipyard here, Bush saw the USS Stark, the Navy ship
damaged last year by Iraqi missiles in the Persian Gulf. It is
being overhauled and repaired. He also toured the first of a new
class of amphibious assault ships called the LHD Class.
   He spoke of the expansion of the Navy under the Reagan
administration and Lehman.
   On Tuesday, Bush was accompanied through Florida by former Sen.
Barry Goldwater of Arizona.
   ``Goldwater is right when he says George Bush will be the best
president,'' Bush said in Mobile. ``I can think of no single
endorsement more helpful than that of Barry Goldwater.''
   The Bush campaign plans to use a Goldwater endorsement
commercial in some of the Southern states voting in the March 8
Super Tuesday primary.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson didn't have a paid
staff, much money or very high hopes in overwhelmingly white
Vermont, but his campaign pulled off a strong second-place finish
in Tuesday's presidential primary.
   ``It has a tremendous significance on a symbolic level,''
Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont political science
professor, said Wednesday. ``This is exactly what Jackson hoped
for. He can now say he appealed to more than just blacks going into
Super Tuesday.''
   Jackson finished with 26 percent, behind Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, whose 15-person paid staff and 60-plus volunteers
helped him capture 57 percent of the vote. Vice President George
Bush won the GOP primary.
   ``This is a home-grown campaign where people have worked all the
time, constantly on the issues,'' said Chris Wood of the Jackson
campaign. ``We're working on issues that Jackson is talking about.''
   Wood said many of those who worked for Jackson also were active
in grass roots organizations supporting low-income Vermonters and
the state's financially distressed dairy farmers. Many also have
protested apartheid in South Africa.
   Jackson raked in three times as many votes Tuesday as he did in
1984, when he won 7.8 percent of the vote.
   According to unofficial results, with 100 percent of the state's
262 precincts reporting, Dukakis had 57 percent, Jackson 26
percent, Rep. Richard Gephardt 8 percent; Sen. Paul Simon 5 percent
and former Sen. Gary Hart, who won Vermont in 1984, 4 percent. Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. was not on the ballot here.
   On the Republican side, Bush received 49 percent, Sen. Bob Dole
39 percent, former television evangelist Pat Robertson 5 percent
and Rep. Jack Kemp 4 percent.
   Political observers had predicted a tight race between Jackson
and Gephardt for second place, but Jackson stole the show.
   He ran a strong second in the state's largest city of Burlington
and actually beat Dukakis in 27 smaller communities and tied him in
two.
   ``It depended really on volunteers,'' said Eric Davis, a
political science professor at Middlebury College. ``They weren't
putting up lawn signs _ they weren't doing mailings. To get almost
30 percent of the vote just on grass roots says something about
Jackson's appeal.''
   Jackson's campaign was propelled by the alliance of the Rainbow
Coalition of Vermont and the Progressive Coalition and its most
prominent member, Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders.
   Sanders, a socialist, endorsed Jackson during one of his recent
visits to the state. Jackson was one of the few candidates to
actively campaign in Vermont in the last days before the election.
   The fight for Vermont's delegates to the national convention
begins in April with local party caucuses.

   British politician Neil Kinnock tried to sweep his
colleagues off their feet Wednesday when he serenaded them with a
vacuum cleaner in the House of Commons.
   The opposition Labor Party leader played a few notes on the
vacuum cleaner at a news conference to promote a summer concert
series in Wales, which will include a piece with the familiar
domestic device.
   The vacuum will be featured at a July 22 fthe past three decades marked
the golden anniversary by
quietly sketching another adventure.
   ``It's just another day for me,'' said Curtis Swan, 68, who has
been drawing Superman since the mid-1950s.
   Swan, who prefers anonymity to adulation, said he is amazed that
the cartoon character's popularity has sustained and even grown
over the years.
   He also said he plans to keep drawing.
   ``I'm never going to retire. I want to keep those fires
burning,'' he said. ``Discipline and work is what keeps you
going,'' Swan said Monday, Superman's 50th anniversary.
   Several years ago, DC Comics decided to revamp Superman's
character for the 1980s.
   ``They are trying now to make Superman vulnerable to certain
things, to work out his problems on a mental basis without
muscle,'' Swan said.
   ``They (the editors) are trying to show that Superman has his
limitations. He's more intimate with the ladies, especially Lois
Lane, and Clark Kent is more of a Yuppie ...''

   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker is going back to school _ as a professor.
   Volcker was named Wednesday to a professor's post at Princeton
University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs.
   He was graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School in 1949 and is
the first incumbent of the Frederic H. Schultz Class of 1951
Professorship of International Economic Policy.
   ``I'm somewhat intimidated by the fact that I'm having to go
back and do a little teaching. I'm hoping for a little assistance
to help me through those early stages,'' Volcker said.
   The former Fed chief, whose ambitions had remained unclear
following his departure from the job last August, said he declined
professor offers from other universities, including Harvard, where
he received a master's in political economy in 1951.
   ``I felt comfortable (at Princton). The school combines my
interest in the public service and in economic policy.''
   Volcker said he has not severed ties with Wall Street and that
his business connections will prevent him from teaching full time
at Princeton.
   During the 1988-89 academic year he plans to teach both
semesters at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

<HEAD>Bank Profits in 1987 Lowest Since Depression</HEAD>

   Banks recorded their least profitable year
since the Great Depression in 1987, but a top federal regulator
said Wednesday he sees better days ahead.
   The nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $3.7
billion last year on assets of $3 trillion, down from $17.5 billion
earnings in 1986, said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   That amounted to a return on assets of only 0.13 percent last
year and was the lowest level since the FDIC, which insures
deposits of up to $100,000, was established in 1934.
   The year-to-year drop in earnings was due entirely to large
banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to
Third World countries, Seidman said. Nine of the 10 largest banks
and 17 of the 25 largest reported a loss for 1987.
   ``Absent the extraordinary reserving for (developing country)
loans ... net income would have been roughly equal to 1986's
level,'' Seidman said in the FDIC's bank profile for the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   Seidman said he believed there was a good chance that banks
could avoid further large additions to reserves for bad Third World
loans and said, ``The outlook for 1988 is cautiously optimistic.''
   ``Barring any new shocks, loan loss provisioning should be lower
than usual this year, and profitablity at money center and regional
banks will be much improved,'' Seidman said, predicting that bank
profits this year could return to about the 1986 level.
   He also said office occupancy rates and other signs appear to
indicate that the economy of the Southwest, which accounted for
more than half of last year's bank failures, may have hit bottom
and be on the rebound. But he cautioned that much of the region's
health depends on oil prices remaining stable or rising.
   The oil-producing states of Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma
accounted for 95 of last year's 184 bank failures, the most
recorded since 1933. Twenty-eight banks have failed in the first
two months of this year, 16 of them in the three oil states.
   The number of federally insured commercial banks, which is
shrinking because of failures and mergers, dwindled from a peak of
about 14,500 in 1985 to about 13,700 last year, the lowest number
since 1971.
   The results for all of 1987 masked a more positive fourth
quarter. Despite loan loss provisions of $7.7 billion for the
quarter, banks posted a $3.2 billion profit, 25 percent higher than
the last quarter of 1986.
   Seidman said banks were especially strengthened in the fourth
quarter by a flood of new deposits as investors after the Oct. 19
stock market crash pulled their money out of stocks and put it into
insured bank accounts.
   The crash also triggered a surge in loan demand from stock
brokerages and other financial service firms, the FDIC chairman
said. And, because the Federal Reserve pumped money into the
economy in response to the crash, banks are enjoying lower interest
rates.
   Another encouraging sign, Seidman said, was the drop from 1,609
to 1,559 during the last half of 1987 in the number of banks on the
FDIC's problem list.
   In addition, the number of banks losing money fell for the first
time since 1980. The FDIC estimated that 2,366 banks were
unprofitable last year, down from 2,784 in 1986 and 2,453 in 1985.
   In a report earlier this week, the FDIC said its insurance fund
held steady in 1987 despite the heavy load of bank failures. The
fund finished the year at $18.3 billion, up modestly from $18.25
billion at the end of 1986.
   The slight gain was posted despite a provision for the
second-largest bank rescue ever by the FDIC. Shareholders of First
City Bancorporation of Houston are scheduled to vote Friday on a
restructuring package that would involve nearly $1 billion in
government assistance.

<HEAD>High Court Throws Out Award to City Employee Over Firing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday made it more
difficult for people to win lawsuits against a city government
based on claims that low-ranking officials violated their rights.
   But the decision in a St. Louis case yielded no clear-cut
majority view and left some key questions unanswered
   By a 7-1 vote, the justices threw out a $15,000 award St. Louis
was ordered to pay James J. Praprotnik, a fired city architect.
   But only four of the seven justices voting to overturn the award
joined in the court's main opinion, creating the possibility that a
future case could prompt a different result.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the court's main opinion,
said generally only the highest ranking city officials can commit
constitutional violations that make the city liable.
   In the case of St. Louis, that is limited to the mayor, city
aldermen and the civil service commission, she said.
   Cities may not be held liable unless those who claim their
rights were violated prove the ``existence of an unconstitutional
municipal policy,'' O'Connor said.
   A city cannot be sued successfully based on the claim that
high-ranking officials failed to override a subordinate's decision
that violated someone's rights, she added.
   ``Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one's
subordinates ... is not a delegation to them of the authority to
make policy,'' O'Connor said.
   She also said that state law, and not a jury's examination of
the facts in a particular case, determines who the policy makers
are in a city.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a separate opinion, said
O'Connor's opinion ``turns a blind eye to reality'' in assuming who
makes policy in a particular community.
   Brennan said O'Connor's opinion ``ultimately would permit
municipalities to insulate themselves from liability for the acts
of all but a small minority of actual city policy makers.''
   Brennan's opinion was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and
Harry A. Blackmun. Nonetheless, all three voted with O'Connor and
three other justices to throw out Praprotnik's $15,000 award. They
said a St. Louis official who transferred Praprotnik to a job that
led to his firing lacked policy-making authority.
   O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, voting to uphold
Praprotnik's lower court victory. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who
only recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision.
   Praprotnik was a mid-level manager in St. Louis' community
development agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his
superiors over the proposed installation by the city of a
controversial sculpture.
   Praprotnik was suspended for 15 days by a superior for having
accepted outside employment without prior approval. But after he
appealed to the city civil service commission, he was reinstated
with back pay.
   Then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency, and his
job responsibilities were reduced. He was fired, in what the city
said was a budget-cutting move, on Dec. 30, 1983.
   Praprotnik then sued under a federal civil rights law, charging
he was shunted to a dead-end job and then kicked out because of his
appeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in
1980.
   A jury awarded him $30,000. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reduced the amount to $15,000 while ruling he was fired for
exercising his constitutional rights.
   The appeals court said the city was liable, even though the jury
exonerated the individual officials sued by Praprotnik.
   The justices on Wednesday ordered further lower court hearings
for Praprotnik to determine whether he still has a viable case.
   In another ruling, the justices, by a 4-4 vote, ruled that an
airline may be forced to continue to collect union dues from
workers after its contract with employees has expired.
   The court upheld rulings that forced Trans World Airlines to
continue the dues check-off for replacement employees during a
strike by flight attendants in 1986. TWA also was forced to collect
dues from the strikers once they returned to work.
   The ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by any
indication of how each individual justice voted.

   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that
orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in
January, the first decline in five months, but private economists
said the setback was not serious.
   The report said orders for both durable and non-durable goods
dropped to a seasonally adjusted $212.6 billion in January, down
$1.25 billion from December, when orders had posted a huge 2
percent increase.
   It was the first setback in orders since a 1.4 percent drop in
August, but economists discounted the decline, contending that it
reflected a swing in the volatile transportation category.
   Transportation orders declined 8.8 percent in January, erasing
an 8.9 percent December increase, which had reflected a big jump in
orders for passenger jets.
   Without the large swings in transportation, factory orders would
have climbed 0.8 percent in January following a 0.9 percent
December rise.
   Manufacturing has been enjoying steady increases over the past
year as American producers enjoy booming export sales spurred by
the decline in the value of the dollar.
   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a private
forecasting firm, said that the January factory orders showed more
strength than analysts had been expecting.
   He said manufacturing demand is holding up well despite a large
increase in business inventories during the final three months of
the year. The big inventory rise has raised concerns that orders
will need to be cut until the backlog of unsold goods is reduced.
   ``The inventory scare may be somewhat overblown. If it was that
serious, we would probably see orders weakening more sharply,'' he
said. ``While the economy is not booming, manufacturing is still on
an upward trend and we are likely to miss a recession.''
   The Reagan administration is counting on continued strength in
export sales to provide almost half of the expected growth in the
overall economy this year.
   The January decline in manufactured goods included a 1.5 percent
drop in demand for durable goods. An advance report a week ago put
the January decline in durable goods at 2.8 percent. Orders for
non-durable goods, items not expected to last at least three years,
rose 0.5 percent in January, erasing a 0.5 percent December decline.
   Demand for military equipment fell 3.8 percent in January
following a 7.1 percent drop in December.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods, a key category which
reflects industry plans to expand and modernize, rose 2.6 percent
in January following a 12.6 percent December advance.
   Shipments of manufactured goods fell 1.7 percent in January to
$207.7 billion following a 2 percent December increase.

   At least one person was killed in ethnic riots in
a southern republic but the violence was short-lived, a Soviet
television employee in the region said Wednesday.
   The violence occurred Sunday in Sumgait, an industrial city of
more than 160,000 people in Azerbaijan. The newspaper in Baku, the
republic's capital, did not mention casualties in its report
Wednesday, but said arrests were made.
   ``Order and peace have been ensured by law enforcement organs.
People caught in the unrest have been detained,'' said the
newspaper, Bakinsky Rabochy. It did not give the number of arrests.
   Trouble between Armenians and Azerbaijanis began when ethnic
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region assigned to Azerbaijan,
began demonstrating for union with the neighboring Caucasian
republic of Armenia. The protest spread to Armenia's capital,
Yerevan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Tuesday he
could not confirm reports by Armenian activists that up to 20
people were killed in Sumgait, but added: ``There was hooliganism
and there can be deaths in such cases.''
   The television worker reached by telephone mentioned a ``small
number of victims.'' He identified himself as a duty officer at the
Baku broadcast studios but would not give his namem,
   Pressed for a figure, he said one or two people were killed. He
said he did not know the circumstances of the deaths, but gave a
description of how the riots began.
   About 50 to 60 young ethnic Azerbaijanis who live in Armenia
traveled to Sumgait last weekend and spoke of ethnic problems in
Armenia, he said.
   ``They were frightened,'' said the television employee, who said
he was half Armenian and half Azerbaijani. ``When they told their
relatives, and friends at the vocational school, everyone got very
excited.''
   A group of ``young hooligans'' then went on a rampage, he said.
``It's not a nationality problem, it's just hooliganism,'' he
declared, adding that the violence was limited to Sunday.
   The official media have not reported on causes of the
disturbance. They said Wednesday that Sumgait was calm.
   ``The unrest has been stopped,'' the Baku paper said.
``Businesses and establishments of trade and public dining places
are working in a normal rhythm and classes are taking place in
schools.''
   Gerasimov read the newspaper article to The Associated Press
over the telephone. Copies of the paper itself won't reach Moscow
for several days.
   It and Baku radio said Azerbaijan's premier, Gasan N. Seidov,
had traveled to Sumgait.
   Gerasimov told the news briefing Tuesday that authorities put
Sumgait under curfew. He suggested the unrest there and elsewhere
in the Caucasus was due to ``mistakes'' made 65 years ago when a
territory inhabited largely by Armenians was made part of
Azerbaijan.
   More than three-quarters of the 157,000 people in
Nagorno-Karabakh are ethnic Armenians.
   Predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan is the largest of three Soviet
republics in the region, bordered on the west by largely Christian
Armenia and Georgia and on the north by the Russian republic. The
Caspian Sea runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge.
   Foreign journalists based in Moscow have been barred from the
region and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and
official media have reached Moscow. Few telephone calls got through
to Baku and Sumgait on Wednesday.
   A man answering the telephone at the Azerbaijan Interior
Ministry in Baku said ``everything is over'' in Sumgait. The
conversation was cut off before a reporter could ask his name and
position.
   Baku radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said
two non-voting members of the national Communist Party Politburo,
Georgy P. Razumovsky and Pyotr N. Demichev, visited businesses and
other establishments in Baku to speak to ``working people of these
multinational collectives.''
   It did not say when they were there or whether they went to
Sumgait.
   Hovik Vassilian said by telephone from Yerevan on Wednesday he
had learned from travelers and telephone calls to residents that
protests continued in Nagorno-Karabakh and food was in short supply.
   A Soviet prosecutor reported Saturday that two people living in
a part of Azerbaijan bordering Nagorno-Karabakh had been slain in
unrest linked to the territorial dispute.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for
restraint, and said the Central Committee would review relations
among the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.

   The last resident of the small motel where
Martin Luther King Jr. died refused orders from sheriff's deputies
to leave the rundown building Wednesday and was carried sobbing to
the sidewalk.
   ``You people are making a mistake. You people are making a
mistake,'' said Jacqueline Smith, 37, who had been holed up at The
Lorraine Motel since it was closed by state order Jan. 11 to make
way for an $8.8 million civil rights museum.
   Deputies evicted Ms. Smith after forcing open the door to the
room where she had set up residence. A picture of King and an
American flag decorated the large front window of her room, about
25 feet from where the civil rights leader was felled by an
assassin's rifle slug.
   They carried her to the sidewalk outside the chain-link fence
surrounding the motel, put her down and walked away.
   ``I refuse to stand up,'' she said. A few moments later,
however, she moved to a straight-back wooden chair retrieved from
her belongings stacked nearby under a sheet of black plastic to
keep off a light rain.
   ``If I have to sit out here on this street, I refuse to go,''
she said. ``I'm not going anywyere.''
   Ms. Smith, who has lived and worked at the Lorraine for 11
years, said the museum project will speed efforts to gentrify her
low-income neighborhood.
   ``I'm trying to help the people who live in this area. We're
being forced out,'' she said.
   Ms. Smith said she has relatives in other parts of town, but
does not want to move from neighborhood. She said she cannot afford
to rent an apartment in the area.
   She said the Lorraine should be turned into housing for the
homeless.
   Her eviction was watched by a crowd of news reporters and about
a dozen spectators. Several well-wishers spoke with Ms. Smith after
the deputies left.
   King was killed at the Lorraine on April 4, 1968 while helping
organize a strike by city sanitation workers.
   James Earl Ray, a prison escapee from Missouri, pleaded guilty
to the killing and is serving a 99-year sentence at the Southeast
Tennessee Regional Prison.
   The Lorraine, which has fallen into disrepair over the years,
was bought at a foreclosure auction in 1982 by a citizens group
pushing plans for a civil rights museum at the site.
   The state has appropriated $4.4 million for the project and city
and county governments have agreed to match that amount. The state
has title to the property and will build and operate the museum,
scheduled to open in 1991.
   Ms. Smith repeatedly ignored requests to move, and the state
obtained a court order Tuesday directing sheriff's deputies to
evict her.
   When deputies arrived, Ms. Smith retreated to her room and
refused to open the door.
   Randy Wade, an administrative assistant to the Shelby County
sheriff, pleaded with her to leave peacefully.
   ``We're just doing our job,'' Wade shouted to Ms. Smith as
deputies prepared to force open the door.

<TEXT>
   Bernhard Goetz Jr. has inherited $140,550
from his father's estate, but the man known as the New York subway
gunman has huge legal bills that will quickly eat that up, and
more, his attorney says.
   ``That won't go very far in defending him on anything,'' said
Joseph Kelner, an attorney defending Goetz in three civil cases
asking a total of $63 million in damages.
   Goetz, 40, was sentenced last October to six months in jail and
five years' probation for carrying an unlicensed gun, which he used
to shoot four teen-agers on a subway in December 1984. Three of the
four are suing him for injuries and punitive damages.
   Goetz, who claimed the shootings were in self-defense, is free
on $5,000 bond while his case is appealed.
   His father, Bernhard Willard Goetz Sr., died in 1984, and his
estate was recently settled in Orange County Probate Court. After
payment of taxes, there was $562,200 to be split between the
younger Goetz, his brother and two sisters.
   The estate's attorney, Jerome Bornstein, said Wednesday that all
money had been distributed to the heirs within the past few days.
   The elder Goetz moved to Orlando in 1963 from Rhinebeck, N.Y.,
where the family owned a dairy, a bookbinding company and real
estate. He joined his brothers Fritz and Ludwig in developing a
subdivision in east Orange County.
   Kelner said Tuesday that Goetz, an electronics specialist, can't
afford to take a taxi from Manhattan to the Bronx for civil court
appearances. It's dangerous for Goetz to use public transportation,
the lawyer said.
   One of the shooting victims, James Ramseur, seeks $8.5 million;
another, Troy Canty, has filed two suits for $2.5 million. Darrell
Cabey, who was left a paraplegic from the incident, is suing Goetz
for $50 million.
   Kelner, who is working for Goetz free of charge, said his client
has countersued for $1 ``as a matter of principle because they
foisted this entire incident on him 2{ years ago _ ruining his
life, his business, all of it.''
   Ramseur's lawyer said he was surprised at Goetz's inheritance.
   ``His attorneys have been telling us all along that he doesn't
have a dime,'' said the lawyer, Ron Kliegerman. ``Now we know
there's something there.''
   Goetz has refused to talk to the press in recent weeks.

<HEAD>New Rules Being Developed to Help Farmers Pay Off FmHA Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New rules are being prepared to help farmers
pay off loans owed to the Farmers Home Administration, including
provisions that allow the agency to write off some of the debt so
that families can stay on the land, officials said Wednesday.
   Joe O'Neill, an FmHA spokesman, said the new rules probably will
be ready by June. In many cases, over-burdened borrowers could have
much of their debt written off, trimmed back to reflect their
assets in hopes of keeping them in business.
   However, O'Neill said he had no estimate of how much debt the
FmHA might write off under the new rules.
   ``There's just no way of knowing,'' he said. ``It'll be each
individual case all the way through.''
   At the end of the 1987 fiscal year on Sept. 30, O'Neill said,
261,291 FmHA borrowers owed the agency about $26 billion. Of that,
127,671 were delinquent, owing $6.6 billion, including principal
and interest.
   The new rules are a result of a bill passed by Congress in
December calling on the FmHA, an Agriculture Department agency that
serves as a ``lender of last resort'' for the nation's farmers, to
go easier on borrowers who are behind in their payments.
   The new law requires the agency to do whatever possible to
restructure loans in order to keep FmHA borrowers in business.
   ``Our attitude is going to be different,'' FmHA Administrator
Vance L. Clark told The New York Times. ``We want to make the new
act work, and we're going to have a lot of room to maneuver to
restructure these loans.''
   Lynn Hayes, an attorney with the Farmers Legal Action Group in
St. Paul, Minn., said, ``I'm thrilled they are apparently taking
this legislation seriously and are trying to make it work.''
   Her group has been active for years in challenging FmHA policies
aimed at tougher enforcement of agency collection policies,
including a 1983 lawsuit that led to a suspension of foreclosure
actions until regulations were redesigned to let borrowers know
their alternatives.
   Congress, partly at the prodding of the activist organizations,
agreed that FmHA should slow down and overhaul its policies.
   As a last resort, the new rules would let FmHA write off debts
in excess of a borrower's assets, O'Neill said. For example, if a
farmer's assets were $150,000 and debts totaled $500,000, the
write-off could be as much as $350,000 if the FmHA determined the
farmer could handle the remainder by staying in business.
   ``It makes sense, then, to keep that person in business and
write off the difference between what they owe and their assets _
if the government stands a chance of retrieving more by keeping
that farmer going,'' O'Neill said. ``We're trying to carry out the

<HEAD>Senate Shouldn't Bind Future Presidents on INF Pact Interpretation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department's legal adviser said
Wednesday that the Senate should not revise the arms pact with the
Soviet Union to bind future administrations to the current
understanding of its intent.
   ``I don't think it is necessary or desirable to do that kind of
thing,'' legal adviser Abraham D. Sofaer said in an interview with
The Associated Press.
   But an aide to Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said that based on
discussions Cranston has had with senators from both parties, he
expects ``there to be language in the ratification resolution
addressing the treaty interpretation issues.''
   Few people disagree over the meaning of the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty signed at the U.S.-Soviet summit in
Washington last December calling on the superpowers to destroy
their nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.
   The heart of the dispute, rather, is interpretation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Sofaer is the author of the ``broad
interpretation'' of the ABM treaty which would allow wider testing
of components of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as Star Wars.
   Cranston's legislative aide, Gerry Warburg, said the language
expected in the INF resolution ``would contain a more broad
statement concerning the intepretation of treaties generally,''
including the ABM pact.
   Cranston, along with Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., a
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have been
discussing the issue with Secretary of State George P. Shultz but
have not reached agreement, Warburg said.
   Sofaer said inclusion of restrictive language in a resolution
ratifying the INF treaty would not be binding on the Soviet Union,
and could complicate rather than resolve the issue.
   ``I know that they are not going to get a settlement of the ABM
dispute this way,'' Sofaer said.
   ``It is a potential problem for INF ratification, and I think
overwhelmingly people support INF ratification,'' he said.
   Sofaer noted that Shultz had sent the Senate the 31-volume
negotiating record of the INF pact and also had agreed that any
testimony by administration officials would be ``authoritative''
and reflect the president's understanding of the treaty.
   ``Those practical things have been achieved,'' Sofaer said.
   While the Senate can bind the administration to a particular
interpretation of either the INF or the ABM treaties, he said, it
cannot bind the Soviet Union, unless the treaties are renegotiated.
   ``The treaty reflects two relationships,'' he said. ``It
reflects a relationship between two sovereign nations, and then it
also reflects the relations betwen the United States executive
branch and the Senate.''
   ``When you talk about the meaning of a treaty, you are talking
about the international relationship. You are talking about what
binds the two nations,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Artist Signs Agreement With Soviets For Space Sculpture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMBRACH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American artist said Wednesday he
signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to launch what could be
the first sculpture in space: a huge ring with ``peace'' written on
it in different languages.
   Arthur Woods said he signed the agreement last week with Dmitri
Poletayev, a representative of the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos,
to launch the sculpture in 1990 or 1991.
   He said the ring, with a diameter of 20 feet, would be
transported on a Proton rocket to the Mir space station, from which
it would be deployed.
   Woods will be responsible for financing the launch and
sculpture, at an estimated cost of $300,000. Funding is to come
from private contributions of at least $35 each, said Woods, who
calls the project ``Orbiting Unification Ring Satellite,'' or OURS.
   ``This project is a gesture of getting the public involved in
something that could send a sentiment of world peace'' into space,
said Woods, 39.
   Woods said he asked NASA if it wanted to launch a similar
sculpture but had not received a reply.
   Woods said the ring would be a ``prototype'' for another project
in the works _ a 3,300-foot-diameter sculpture that he hopes will
be put in orbit by the year 200. He said it would be visible from
Earth.
   Woods said the sculptures would be made of a foil-like substance
which would be inflated in space and then become rigid when exposed
to sunlight. He said the technology, known as ISRS for Inflatable,
Space Rigidized Structures, had been developed by a Swiss company,
Contraves. He said he was collaborating with Contraves on the
projects.
   Woods said he grew up near Cape Canaveral and worked there for
two summers while he was a student. He moved to Switzerland in 1974
and describes himself as a painter and sculptor.

   The death of a 12-year-old boy, whose
nude body was found in a portable dishwasher by his mother, appears
to have been accidental, officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's a strange situation,'' said Brown County Sheriff's
Department Commander David Zasada. ``Right now we're not looking at
this as foul play.''
   Michael Conard's body was discovered by his mother, Jean, when
she returned home from work Tuesday afternoon, Zasada said. The
commander said investigators were trying to determine whether there
was forced entry or any sign of a struggle.
   ``I would certainly not at this time say there was a suicide,''
Zasada said.
   The portable dishwasher was found hooked up to the kitchen sink
and running, Zasada said, and the mother turned it off and found
the body of her son inside.
   An autopsy was planned to determine the cause of death, Zasada
said.
   Conard, of Humbolt, was a sixth-grader and member of the
wrestling team at Luxemburg-Casco Elementary School. Terry
DeJaeger, guidance counselor at the school, said students and
teachers put aside their normal routine Wednesday to talk about the
boy's death.
   ``Some of the kids are crying. Some are in shock. Most of them
are having a tough time functioning today,'' DeJaeger said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., on Wednesday
unveiled a $266 million Democratic plan to bolster the government's
emergency food programs, saying ``we cannot afford to do less'' to
battle hunger.
   Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, said the bill would increase funding for federal
programs for food stamps, school breakfasts, child care food and
summer food service.
   ``We have to ask what the cost of not doing this will be,''
Kennedy said at a news conference.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said the question of hunger is ``a
moral issue'' and ``a test of America's conscience.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., introduced companion anti-hunger
legislation in the House.
   Kennedy said domestic hunger had been largely eradicated by the
late 1970s, but that the recession of the early 1980s, coupled with
sharp cuts in social programs under the Reagan administration, has
brought it back at record levels.
   The Emergency Hunger Relief Act of 1988 would focus on the
government's food stamp program, a program started under Kennedy's
brother, John F. Kennedy, in 1961. The senator argued that benefits
for many families are running out well before the end of the month.
   For a typical family of four, the bill would increase benefits
by about six meals per month per person.
   Eligibility modifications would add about 1 million people to
the food stamp program, Kennedy estimated. There now are 18.6
million recipients.
   The bill also would:
   _ Allow other non-profit organizations besides schools and local
governments to operate the Summer Food Service Program. The current
limitations have denied thousands of children nutritious lunches
during the summer when schools are closed, the lawmakers said.
Kennedy said an estimated 170,000 additional children would be
receive benefits under the plan.
   _ Extend the Temporary Food Assistance Program and authorize $50
million annually for the distribution to the needy of corn, wheat
and other surplus commodities.
   _ Increase to $10 million a year the authorization for the
Community Food and Nutrition Program, which funds soup kitchens and
relief centers. The current authorization is at $3 million annually.
   _ Increase school breakfast funding by 3 cents per meal so
children can have eggs on most mornings.
   The bill calls for $266 million in new spending in fiscal 1989
and $675 million in 1990.
   ``We could obviously do more, but we cannot afford to do less,''
Kennedy said. ``The measure ... is designed to be a new declaration
of war on hunger, and this time we intend to see that the war stays
won.''

<TEXT>
   Moslem leader Inamullah Khan, named Wednesday as
winner of the Templeton Prize for progress in religion, said his
lifetime goal is to heal discord among different faiths.
   He is the first Moslem to win the $390,000 prize, the largest in
the world and about $40,000 more than the Nobel prizes.
   ``My life has been spent in the service of mankind seeking peace
where there is war, reconciliation where there is conflict, harmony
where there is discord,'' Khan said.
   Khan, 73, of Karachi, Pakistan, a founder and secretary-general
of the World Moslem Congress, added in a message from his home city:
   ``I do this from my religious conviction and will continue to
work with people of different races and religions and with those of
different views within the same religion.''
   He was cited for his ``tireless work as coordinator for peace
between Moslems, Christians and Jews.''
   At a news conference at the Church Center of the United Nations
where the winner was announced, a Jewish colleague voiced ``great
appreciation'' for Khan's leadership.
   Norma Levitt of New York, who serves with him as one of nine
regional presidents of the World Conference on Religion and Peace,
said the reward was a sign of hope that people of good will can
``live together and advance together in harmony, in justice and in
peace.''
   Khan is chairman of the executive committee and also a regional
president of the World Conference on Religion and Peace.
   Khan, born in Burma of Indian parentage, was editor of Burma's
Moslem Daily until 1942 when Burma was occupied by Japan. He then
moved to India, settling in Karachi when Pakistan was established
in 1948.
   There, he was a founder of the World Moslem Congress, with its
offices initially in his home.
   The annual prize, established in 1972 by American investment
counselor John Templeton, is to recognize those ``who through
original and pioneering ways advanced the knowledge and love of
God.''
   This year's prize is to be presented May 10 in London by
Princess Alexandra.
   Previous winners included 13 Christians, one Hindu and one
Buddhist.
   Templeton, who resides in Nassau, Bahamas, said the award is
intended to encourage people to ``take religion more seriously, to
get excited about the new thinking in it.''
   He told the news conference the prize was purposely kept higher
than the Nobel prizes because religion was more important than
other fields.
   He said world expenditures for scienctific research amount to $1
billion every day, and ``I'm not saying it's not worth the
results,'' but ``it should be equaled by research in the spiritual
realm.''

<HEAD>Teen-agers Knew of Murder Weeks Before Police Notified</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager testified Wednesday that his
14-year-old friend plotted the murder of a classmate, saying he
wanted ``to know what it was like to kill someone.''
   Robbie Peterson, 16, told a hushed courtroom how he was twice
shown the body by Rod Matthews and even accompanied Matthews and
another friend to a pizza parlor to eat after viewing the victim.
   Matthews, 15, went on trial Wednesday as an adult for the murder
of Shaun Ouillette, 14.
   The body remained near a lonely wooded hilltop for three weeks
before another friend wrote an anonymous letter to police.
   ``Rod said not to say anything,'' Peterson said. ``He said it
could happen to us. He said, `You never know.'''
   Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Peter Casey told the
jury of 12 men and four women that Matthews plotted the death of
his schoolmate for more than a month.
   ``He was deliberate in the plan and put it into effect
efficently and effectively,'' he said.
   In opening arguments, defense attorney John Philip White Jr.
said his client suffered from a ``psychiatric illness of major
proportions'' and was not in contact with reality.
   White said Matthews was affected by his use of Ritalin, a
stimulant used to calm hyperactive children.
   Peterson testified Matthews began talking about killing someone
around Halloween 1986. He refined his plan to lure a victim to a
deserted area known as ``The Pits,'' then beat him with a baseball
bat. Peterson said Matthews also planned to cut off his victim's
legs ``and toss them.''
   ``I said why? He said he wanted to know what it was like to kill
somebody. He said `Just for the heck of it,''' said Peterson.
   The teen-ager, testifying in a barely audible voice, told how
Matthews named several potential victims before settling on
Ouillette, an overweight high school freshman.
   ``He said he (Ouillette) would be the least missed, that he
didn't have that many friends,'' Peterson said.
   Peterson said he had warned other potential victims not to go to
Matthews' home. Although he knew of Matthews' plan to lure
Ouillette into the woods with the promise of fireworks, Peterson
said he only suggested to Ouillette that he have Matthews bring the
fireworks to school.
   Peterson said the day of the murder he saw Matthews walking down
the street with a baseball bat and asked if he killed Ouillette. He
said Matthews hestitated before admitting to the killing, then
agreed to take Peterson to the murder scene after leaving a large
knife in Peterson's room.
   Peterson said Matthews explained how he walked in Ouillette's
footsteps in the snow, then hit him with a bat.
   ``He said Shaun fell down and said `help me' and Rod hit him
again.''
   Ouillette's mother, Jeanne Quinn, sobbed as she heard the
description of her son's murder. Matthews was expressionless.
   White portrayed his client as a youth from a troubled home
obsessed with personal hygiene and fascinated by fire. He told of a
note Matthews wrote to a health teacher a Canton High School which
warned of his plans to kill.
   According to White, the note read in part, ``My problem is that
I like to do crazy things ... lately I want to kill people. I hate
and I want to set houses on fire.''
   White said the teacher made note of the letter on a file card,
but did nothing until after Matthews was arrested.

   Eleven more people have died after
eating improperly prepared soybeans in the Central Java district of
Banyumas, bringing the death toll to 34, a medical official said
Wednesday.
   Koentoro, head of the district health office in Banyumas, said
the latest victims died Tuesday after eating soybean cakes
contaminated with poisonous acid. The poisonings occurred in
Dermaji, 300 miles southeast of Jakarta.
   A Health Ministry official in Jakarta said Tuesday that 260
people had been hospitalized in Dermaji over the past two weeks
after eating the soybean cakes, known locally as tempe bongkrek.
   The official said poverty had forced villagers to ignore a
government ban on eating the cheap food, which sometimes contains
the poisonous acid bongkrekik.
   Koentoro said 33 people still were hospitalized, some in grave
condition.
   Two people who allegedly produced and sold the cakes have been
arrested, the ministry official said.

<HEAD>Judge Asks Prosecutors To Examine State ``Blacklisting'' of
Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge has accused the Cuomo
administration of blacklisting construction companies that fail to
comply with affirmative action rules, and then allowing the
companies to ``buy'' their way off the list.
   Quoting from a section of federal law defining extortion, state
Supreme Court Justice Harold Hughes said he was referring the case
to federal and state prosecutors and to the state's Commission on
Goverment Integrity for review.
   The ruling, in a lawsuit filed by a paving contractors group
against the state, was made public Wednesday.
   ``In the court's view, a judge is under a duty to report
potential criminal activity that comes to light in the course of a
proceeding pending before him,'' said Hughes. ``This is especially
so when government officials are involved.''
   Hughes did not charge that crimes had been committed, and he
said his referral to the prosecutors had been recommended by the
state's attorney in the case.
   Administration officials denied wrongdoing or that a blacklist
existed.
   ``It would appear to be somewhat of a strange decision and our
counsels will be reviewing it with the (state) attorney general's
office,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The suit was filed by the New York State Asphalt Pavement
Association, a group representing 34 contractors, against state
Department of Transportation Commissioner Franklin White and state
Office of General Services Commissioner John Egan.
   It asked that White and Egan stop imposing restrictions on
member companies other than what was written in law.
   In denying a state motion to dismiss the association's lawsuit,
Hughes said one construction company, to get off the blacklist, had
agreed to pay $150,000 to ``a not-for-profit organization or other
support entities, whose purpose is to provide support to the
(state's) Disadvantaged, Minority, Women's Business Enterprise
Program.''
   Compelling contractors to enter into such agreements constitutes
unethical and possibly criminal conduct, the judge said.
   The lawsuit stems from an attempt by White, one of the highest
ranking blacks in the Cuomo administration, to crack down on
contractors who are not meeting state and federal requirements for
hiring minorities, who have established ``front'' companies that
falsely claim to be minority owned, or who have engaged in criminal
activity such as bid-rigging.
   White spokesman Timothy Hulbert told the Albany Times Union that
the judge's ruling was ``inflammatory and inappropriate.''
   There is nothing illegal about barring contractors from doing
business with the state if they have violated state laws or
regulations, Hulbert said. Such action was taken only on a
``case-by-case basis'' and no blacklist was maintained, he said.
   Hulbert also said there was nothing illegal about having the
companies pay money to improve minority hiring programs as part of
any agreements for them to get back in the state's good graces.

Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's claims that it
does not plan the highest-level of experiments at a proposed
biological testing laboratory drew skepticism Wednesday from Utah
Gov. Norm Bangerter.
   Bangerter, who toured the western desert installation's current
biological test lab Wednesday, told reporters that officials had
given him a different message than he received when he met with
Defense Department representatives last month in Washington.
   He said officials had told him then that ``there's a high
likelihood they're going to be BL-4 (the highest level of biosafety
containment). If they really think they're going to do B-L4, that's
what they ought to clear for,'' the governor said.
   However, Army officials maintained Wednesday the proposed $5.3
million lab at Dugway Proving Ground had plans only for B-L3
experimentation. Dugway spokeswoman Kathy Whitaker stressed that
the new lab's mission would be defensive _ testing soldiers'
protective gear against various biological agents.
   ``The plan is to do B-L3 work. We're overbuilding for the added
safety it gives us,'' she said, noting that the proposed facility
would feature three pressurized labs and double-layered walls over
1,540 square feet.
   Dugway Director of Material Test Col. Wyett Colclasure said
another reason for building the new lab complex to B-L4 guidelines
was cost.
   While the project cost $600,000 more as a B-L4 than B-L3
complex, trying to upgrade the facility later would cost much more,
he said. Colclasure did not say how much more, however.
   Colclasure said the Soviet Union's endeavors in biological
testing made the project a neccessity.
   ``I believe the Soviets are working very diligently on a
biological warfare capability. We must be sensitive to that,'' he
said.
   The Army released an environmental impact statement on the lab
complex in January, saying that construction and operation of the
facility posed no danger to employees, the public at large or the
environment.
   The present B-L2 level test facility at Dugway was established
in 1952. Although it has been modified over the years, the facility
has become inadequate for present-day testing needs because
operators are unable to conduct the full range of tests required,
officials said.

   Sen. Jesse Helms withdrew objections Wednesday
to Senate confirmation of Army Maj. Gen. William F. Burns to head
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in a move linked to the
lawmaker's battle against the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty.
   Helms, R-N.C., told the Senate he never had any objectios to
Burns or to his qualifications, which he said are ``excellent.''
   The senator said he had delayed action on the Burns nomination
in order to provide ammunition for his fight against the new
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which bans U.S. and
Soviet missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.
   He announced he has wrested a promise from the Reagan
administration to promptly release two reports bearing on alleged
Soviet violations of arms control treaties and the effectiveness of
proposed verification of Soviet compliance with the new treaty.
   But Helms demanded the administration also prepare a third
report _ confirming whether or not the Soviet Union has violated
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty _ and make it available
before the Senate acts on the INF pact.
   ``I would strenuously object to the Senate moving on this treaty
until we get this information,'' Helms told reporters. ``I think
the Senate would go off half-cocked if it had no capability to
assess these violations. They would be simply swept under the rug
in an atmosphere of euphoria.''
   Complaining the administration has ignored a treaty provision
calling for such a review of compliance every five years, Helms
drafted legislation declaring the United States ``is violating the
ABM treaty.''
   He first offered it as an amendment to pending legislation
restricting the use of lie detectors in private businesses, then
withdrew it, saying he will offer it later if necessary.
   Helms contended a review of Soviet compliance would require the
United States to protest ``at least one material breach of the ABM
treaty by Russia.''
   The United States has long complained that the Soviets may be
violating the ABM treaty by building a radar system at Krasnoyarsk
in the central Soviet Union.
   Helms made public an exchange of letters with President Reagan
and Colin L. Powell, Reagan's national security adviser, in which
the senator stated that Burns appears to be ``an excellent
nominee.''
   But he also complained that the arms control agency's failure to
produce the three reports ``clouds the current hearings'' over the
INF treaty.
   He said he has also ``received reports from witnessess that
large quantities of documents were shredded late last week'' in
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency offices ``under investigation
by the FBI and GA0.'' The Government Accounting Office is the
investigative arm of Congress.
   Replying for Reagan, Powell said Burns has given personal
assurances he will cooperate fully with the FBI and GAO
investigations. But Powell did not comment on the alleged shredding
of documents as such.
   He said the arms control agency's report on treaty violations
will be sent to Congress on March 8 and that the report on treaty
verification will be delivered March 14.
   But Powell said the administration believes it has until next
October before reviewing Soviet compliance with the terms of the
ABM treaty.
   Helms called that a ``ruse'' and said the review was required to
be completed last Oct. 2. He said he believes the review has been
delayed so as not to interfere with Senate ratification of the INF
pact.
   Burns is currently principal deputy assistant secretary of state
for politico-military affairs. He served for four years as the
Pentagon's representative at the U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the
INF treaty.
   He would succeed Kenneth L. Adelman, who announced his intention
to retire last July.

<HEAD>General Assembly Orders US to Submit to Arbitration on PLO Mission</HEAD>

   The United Nations today voted 143-1 for
the United States to submit to binding arbitration on whether it
can shut down the PLO observer mission.
   The United States did not vote, and Israel cast the only
negative vote.
   Assembly resolutions are expressions of international will but
are not legally binding and there is no mechanism to enforce them.
They are often ignored or defied.
   Israeli Ambassador Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestine
Liberation Organization is a terrorist group that has no place in
the United Nations.
   Netanyahu stalked out of the chamber when the PLO
representative, Zehdi Labib Terzi, said Israel's vote showed
contempt for the world body and ``the norms of civilized behavior.''
   Soviet Ambassador Aleksander Belonogov said in an interview
after the voting that the dispute with the United Nations was a
``self-inflicted wound'' on American prestige and peace efforts in
the Middle East.
   The assembly also voted 142-0 for a resolution asking the World
Court in the Hague for a ruling on whether the United States has
the right to refuse arbitration. Neither Israel nor the United
States voted on the measure.
   The arbitration would be conducted by an independent
three-member panel, with the United States and the United Nations
each appointing one member and the third appointed jointly.
   The United States, which has not yet moved to close the PLO
mission, said it considered the emergency meeting of the 159-nation
assembly ``premature and unnecessary.''
   The United States has rebuffed arbitration on the same grounds.
   ``It remains the intention of this government to find an
appropriate resolution to this problem in light of the charter of
the United Nations, the headquarters agreement and the laws of the
United States,'' U.S. Ambassador Herbert Okun told the assembly
after the vote.
   The resolutions were sponsored by the Soviet Union, which
accused the United States of ``lawlessness,'' several Soviet allies
and satellites, members of the movement of nations professing
non-alliance with either superpower and the Philippines, a U.S.
ally.
   The resolutions say closing the mission would violate the 1947
treaty under which the United States became U.N. headquarters. The
pact provides for binding arbitration.
   The PLO has non-voting, observer status in the General Assembly
and exercises considerable influence at the United Nations, which
regards it as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people, many of whom live under Israeli occupation.
   The PLO mission, a four-story townhouse on Manhattan's
fashionable Upper East Side, has a staff of three political
officers and two secretaries.
   Scores of organizations and nations, including most of America's
closest allies, said during the three-day emergency session that
closing the mission would undermine the independence of the world
body.
   Many said the move is further eroding the already diminished
U.S. prestige at the world body. Others warned it could cripple
American peace efforts in the Middle East.
   The State Department agrees with the United Nations that the
anti-terrorism legislation ordering the mission closed violates the
headquarters agreement. But Attorney General Edwin Meese III
reportedly said he plans to enforce the measure anyway. He is
expected to announce his decision later this month.
   The State Department closed down the only other PLO office in
the United States, an information office in Washington, in what
turned out to be a futile attempt to forestall the legislation.
   Underlying the bitter confrontation over the mission is the
nagging question of what the United Nations can do to achieve peace
in the Middle East.
   The world body has repeatedly called an international peace
conference that would include the PLO and the Soviet Union, among
others. The United States, which wants direct talks, and Israel,
which refuses to deal with the PLO, resist this plan.
   Several speakers in the assembly debate noted that the United
States has never accused anyone accredited to the mission of
terrorism or expelled anyone attached to the mission.
   In December, the assembly passed a resolution 145-1 asking the
United States not to close the PLO mission. Israel, which regards
the PLO as a terrorist group bent on the destruction of the Jewish
state, cast the only negative vote.

   Two Scandinavian relief workers came home
to the emotional embraces of their sobbing families on Wednesday
and recounted their harrowing abduction in Lebanon and 25 days of
fear and captivity.
   Jan Stening of Sweden and Norwegian William Jorgenson greeted
their wives and children at a downtown Vienna hotelslightly more 24
hours after being freed by their unknown kidnappers.
   Jorgenson said he feared he would die in the ordeal that began
with his Feb. 5 abduction.
   ``My only thought was of my wife,'' said Jorgenson, pausing to
collect himself as his daughter, Sessil, began crying. His wife,
Gerd, and son, Kurt, also were at the news conference.
   Stening, 44, and Jorgenson, 58, were working with the
Vienna-based U.N. Works and Relief Agency that cares for some
280,000 refugees in Lebanon when they were kidnapped.
   Giorgio Giacomelli, head of the Vienna-based agency, Giacomelli
said both men were in relatively good shape.
   ``It's the end of a very sad story, which luckily had a happy
conclusion,'' Giacomelli said.
   In Beirut on Wednesday, a group called the Holy Warriors of
Freedom claimed responsibility for the Jan. 27 kidnapping of West
German engineer Ralph Schray and said it may release him soon.
   The claim was made in a typewritten Arabic statement from the
group, which is believed to be headed by a brother of two men
already linked to a 1985 hijacking and to the kidnappings.
   The statement was released to a Western news agency in Beirut
along with a photograph of Schray. The picture showed a bearded
Schray in blue jeans and a dark blue sweater looking directly at
the camera.
   Giacomelli noted the other kidnap victims in Lebanon and said
their plight tempered the happiness over the return of Stening and
Jorgenson.
   Including Schray, there are 23 foreigners missing after being
kidnapped in Lebanon since March 1985. They are nine Americans,
four Frenchmen, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an
Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   ``Our common joy doesn't allow us to forget other colleagues who
are still missing. We hope they will join us again soon,''
Giacomelli said.
   Among those missing is U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
who was abducted Feb. 17 in south Lebanon.
   A statement released by the abductors, the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, said Israel's crackdown on Palestinian unrest
in Israeli-occupied territories and the Middle East trip of
Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``make us more determined to
try this criminal, Higgins.''
   Both the United Nations and the United States have denied that
Higgins, who served with the U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon, was a CIA spy.
   Higgins, 43, was abducted near south Lebanon's port of Tyre on
Feb. 17. He heads a 76-man U.N. observer group that monitors truce
violations on the Lebanon-Israel border under a 1949 armistice
agreement.
   Stening said at a morning news conference in Beirut that four
gunmen kidnapped the two U.N. workers near south Lebanon's
provincial capital of Sidon as they were driving from their base in
the southern port of Tyre to Beirut.
   The two men were moved to various locations in Lebanon.
   The first word about the release of Stening and Jorgenson came
in a handwritten Arabic statement delivered to a Western news
agency in Beirut late Tuesday. The statement was accompanied by a
picture showing the two men. It said ``after they were proved
innocent, they were released.''
   Most of the U.N. relief group's services to the refugees were
suspended after the abudctions. Giacomelli did not say if they
would be resumed.
   At one point during his captivity, Jorgenson said he was
convinced he and Stening would be killed when what looked like an
explosive was brought into one of the rooms where they were held.
   Jorgenson said their clothes were cleaned and the two men were
given a chance to wash the day before they were released.
   On Tuesday, with his new freedom, Jorgenson said he started
smoking again.
   ``I'm a free man and I can cough when I want to,'' he quipped.

<HEAD>Diversion of Withheld Taxes by Employers is Growing, IRS Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf, ``The IRS,'' to CORRECT returns filed last
week</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing amount of tax money withheld from
workers' paychecks is being misused by employers, often never
finding its way to the government, the Internal Revenue Service
said Wednesday.
   The total of these delinquent Social Security and income taxes
rose by 49 percent from 1982 through 1987, to almost $3.73 billion,
said William M. Wauben, IRS assistant commissioner for collections.
About 338,000 employers have failed to pay or account for that sum.
   Because withheld taxes account for 69 percent of all federal
revenues, ``even a slight decline ... can have a devastating
impact'' on the government, Wauben said at a news conference.
   The IRS also announced that although fewer individaul taxpayers
are filing their returns early this year, the pace is picking up.
Through Feb. 26, 30.2 million returns had been filed, down 4.9
percent from a year ago. But last week, the IRS received 6.7
million, up 3 percent from the same week in 1987.
   The IRS speculates that taxpayers are delaying filing this year
because of all the changes caused by a sweeping tax revision
enacted in 1986.
   The number of returns qualifying for refunds is down 4.5
percent, to 7.55 million this year, but the average refund has
risen to $793, from $735 a year ago.
   Wauben said employers' failure to forward taxes withheld from
workers' checks often is caused by ignorance of the law, although
in some cases withheld taxes are kept out of greed. Often as not,
he said, the problem is traced to a failing company's efforts to
stay afloat.
   ``When employers find they are no longer able to keep their
business operating on the cash available and they ... are unable to
borrow from a bank or other lending institution, some begin using
the funds withheld from their employees' wages as their own,''
Wauben said.
   Employers are required to turn over withheld taxes to the
government at least once a quarter. Some big companies pay the IRS
every three days; most employers file these employment-tax returns
weekly or biweekly.
   An employer's misdeed does not necessarily cause a problem for
workers. Even though workers' withheld taxes might never be turned
over to the government, their accounts will be credited by the
government so long as they file an income tax return.
   The rise in delinquent withheld taxes is attributed to the fact
that total payrolls and Social Security taxes have been increasing
steadily. Wauben said there has been a disproportionate increase in
areas of the Southwest, where oil prices and real estate values
have dropped sharply.
   Wauben said a new IRS program aimed at another route of tax
evasion has produced good results. This involves the practice of
some employers of wrongly classifying some employees as independent
contractors.
   That means the employer does not withheld Social Security and
income taxes from these workers, although they are required to make
quarterly estimated tax payments. But many such workers understate
their earnings, and some don't even file returns, the IRS says.
   During a two-year study in 26 areas of the nation, IRS
collections officers audited 1,196 employers suspected of
misclassifying workers as independent contractors. As a result,
9,004 delinquent quarterly employment-tax returns were filed and
the IRS hit 92 percent of the audited employers with tax bills
averaging $3,000.
   Because of those findings, the IRS has assigned nearly 400
collections officers to concentrate on investigating similar cases.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction workers stayed off the
job throughout Nicaragua for the third day Wednesday to demand
higher wages and to protest the Sandinista government's new
economic measures.
   The opposition General Workers Confederation said 4,000 workers
had been on strike since Monday, paralyzing 53 construction
projects nationwide. The Labor Ministry said the strikes involved
600 workers at 12 work sites.
   The workers are demanding a 200 percent salary increase and an
end to wage scales that are fixed for almost all jobs. Construction
workers earn the equivalent of $412 a month. Apprentices make $266.
   ``These salaries don't meet the basic food needs,'' said Carlos
Salgado, secretary-general of the General Workers Confederation, in
an interview.
   Citing runaway inflation, the government announced a series of
economic measures Feb. 14. A new version of the currency, the
cordoba, was issued and valued at 10 to the dollar. Prices set by
the leftist government for most products soared.
   The old currency was fetching 20,000 to $1 on the legal exchange
and more than 50,000 to the dollar on the black market.
   President Daniel Ortega said the measures were intended to fight
inflation, which he said was running at 1,300 percent. Unofficial
estimates put the figure at 7,000 percent.
   Under a new wage scale, salaries range from the equivalent of
$50 a month to $753. The price of a pound of meat rose from about
$1 per pound to $3.50. Eggs went from just over $1 a dozen to $2.50.
   Angel Reyes Palma, regional director of work inspection for the
Labor Ministry, called the construction workers' strike illegal.
   He said a legal strike requires a petition and naming of a
special judge to determine the merits of the case.
   ``They want to boycott the economic measures, and while they
stay on strike there is no negotiation,'' Reyes said.
   Strikes were illegal in Nicaragua under a state of emergency the
government imposed in 1982, shortly after the war with the
U.S.-backed Contras heated up. The restrictive measures were
withdrawn in January as part of the government's compliance with a
regional peace plan.

<DATELINE>POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Threats against Tawana Brawley may
soon motivate the family to end a stalemate and begin cooperating
with state prosecutors, according to a report published Wednesday.
   The family of the black Wappingers Falls teen-ager who claims
she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by six white men in
November is increasingly concerned about her safety, the
Poughkeepsie Journal, said, quoting an anonymous source said to be
close to the family.
   On the advice of her lawyers, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox
Jr., the family has thus far refused to cooperate with Attorney
General Robert Abrams, whom Gov. Mario Cuomo appointed as a special
prosecutor.
   The lawyers want Abrams ousted and a permanent special
prosecutor named to investigate race-related crimes.
   Mason and Maddox did not immediately return telephone calls to
their office Wednesday.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York City minister who has been
advising the Brawleys, denied that the family was on the verge of
cooperating with authorities and refused to comment on reports
there had been threats against Miss Brawley.
   Sharpton confirmed that he had taken Miss Brawley from the home
of Matthew Strong, the uncle with whom she had been staying since
the attack. He would not say where Miss Brawley was staying.
   A woman who answered the phone at the Brawley's house Wednesday
said neither Glenda Brawley, Miss Brawley's mother, nor Juanita
Brawley, the girl's aunt, were available. She said the family had
no comment.
   Miss Brawley, 16, was found wrapped in a garbage bag after being
missing for four days last November. Excrement was smeared on her
body and ``KKK'' and ``nigger'' were written in charcoal or black
ink on her body.
   Strong had vowed to ``march Tawana down to Abrams' office'' if
the stalemate did not end in the next few days, the Journal quoted
the source as saying. Strong has been critical of the lawyers'
handling of the case, according to several published reports.
   A 23-member grand jury was empaneled Monday to investigate the
case, and jurors heard an opening statement from Abrams. Sharpton
called the attorney general's participation Monday ``a good sign.''
   The panel is not expected to hear evidence this week.

<HEAD>Social Democrats and Liberals Will Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The centrist Social Democrats and Liberals will
unite on Thursday after a stormy courtship during which they ran as
the Alliance in two elections but were proccupied with their own
quarrels.
   The new Social and Liberal Democrats Party hopes to end the
dominance of the governing Conservatives and the socialist Labor
Party, the main opposition.
   In a mail referendum, Social Democrats voted 18,722 to merge and
9,929 against, or slightly under 2-1. Liberals approved the union
46,376 to 6,365, or more than 7-1, said to the London-based
Electoral Reform Society, which counted the votes.
   Separate party conventions approved the merger last month.
   Only 55.5 percent of the 52,000 Social Democrats and 52.3
percent of the 90,000 Liberals voted. Protracted infighting over
the merger had split both parties.
   Liberal leader David Steel and Robert Maclennan, the Social
Democrat leader, toasted each other with champagne.
   Steel, who is expected to be elected leader of the new party,
said he looked forward to ``success and the future.'' Maclennan
described the vote as ``clinching.'' The party is to be officially
launched Thursday.
   David Owen, who resigned as Social Democrat leader in opposition
to the union, had urged members to boycott the vote and called it a
``fiasco.'' He plans to continue the Social Democrats as a separate
party.
   The two parties began the merger process after placing a distant
third in last June's general election, won by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.

   Jody Powell is volunteering the public
relations skills he practiced in the White House to fight plans for
a shopping mall near fields where his Confederate ancestors fought.
   Powell, who was President Carter's press secretary, is putting
the resources of his firm, Ogilvy & Mather Public Affairs of
Washington at the disposal of groups joined in the Save the
Battlefield Coalition.
   Powell said Tuesday the fight to preserve the site near the
Manassas Battlefield National Park is worthwhile because
encroaching development is a problem at many other battlefields and
historic sites as well.
   ``Goodness, if you can't stop something this bad, then what
hopes do you have of fending off more creeping sorts of problems,
where a park gets nibbled to death?'' Powell said.
   Ten of his family members fought at the Battle of Second
Manassas in 1862, part of which was waged on land where the
Hazel-Peterson Cos. of Fairfax plan to break ground for William
Center.
   One of Powell's ancestors was mortally wounded just before the
battle, as Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson
raided the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction.
   On the site where Gen. Robert E. Lee built his headquarters
during Second Manassas, Hazel-Peterson and the Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. of Ohio plan to build a 1.2 million-square-foot shopping mall.

<HEAD>Opponents Fail To File Delegate Slates, So Bush Picks Up 24 NY
Delegates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate George Bush
picked up 24 delegates in New York this week by virtue of his
opponents' failure to file delegate slates in eight of the state's
congressional districts.
   And successful challenges to non-Bush delegate slates in other
districts, if upheld by the courts, could leave the vice president
with at least two dozen other delegates running unopposed.
   The Board of Elections on Tuesday wiped two slates of delegates
supporting Bob Dole off the the April 19 primary ballot, one day
after stripping the Kansas senator's slate and one backing New York
Rep. Jack Kemp from the ballot.
   The petitions were rejected mainly because they did not contain
the required 1,250 signatures of registered Republicans, or were
signed by Republicans living outside the congressional district the
petitions were filed for.
   While Bush slates remain on the ballot in 33 of the state's 34
congressional districts, Kemp will be able to field delegate slates
in only 12 districts, Dole in 11 and Robertson in nine.
   Having delegate slates on the ballot is all-important in New
York where registered Republicans will not vote for any of the
candidates, but for the delegates who pledge to support them at the
national convention in New Orleans.
   The candidates that the delegates back will be listed next to
the delegates' names on this year's ballot.
   At stake in New York are 102 delegates, three from each
congressional district. The Republican state committee will
designate 34 other delegates after the primary.
   The vice president's campaign has managed to get 10 Dole slates
knocked off the ballot, as well as six slates supporting Pat
Robertson and five backing Kemp.
   Decisions disqualifying nominating petitions can be appealed to
state courts, and Bush opponents say they will pursue that course
in most cases.
   Meanwhile, in the early round of the Wyoming caucuses, Dole
gained one delegate while another remains uncommitted. Caucuses in
the state continue through Saturday.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mentally ill prostitute who sold his blood
even though he is infected with AIDS was acquitted Wednesday of
charges of attempted poisoning.
   Jurors said they had decided that Joseph Markowski lacked the
intent required for a conviction under state law, frustrating
prosecutors who said the 29-year-old drifter ``can go out and do
this again.''
   ``What this has told us here today is that the law in the state
of California does not make it a crime to sell AIDS-contaminated
blood. And that's unfortunate,'' said Los Angeles County District
Attorney Ira Reiner.
   Markowski, a homosexual prostitute who has tested positive for
the AIDS virus, nodded to his attorney, Guy O'Brien, as the jury
found him innocent of two counts of attempted poisoning.
   He had been accused of selling his tainted blood for $10 to
Plasma Production Associates last June 22 and of trying to do so
again June 25. One of the ways AIDS can be spread is by transfusion
of infected blood or blood products. He would have faced up to
seven years in prison if convicted.
   ``I'm delighted and I'm a little surprised'' by the verdict,
said O'Brien, who had argued that Markowski, homeless and
destitute, had sold his blood in desperation.
   ``I was afraid the jury wouldn't have the courage to follow the
letter of the law. I thought the fear of AIDS ... would preoccupy
the jury.''
   Markowski, originally from Michigan, was first arrested June 23
after screaming, ``Kill me! Kill me! I have AIDS!'' in a Hollywood
bank while attempting to grab a security guard's gun. Police found
on him a receipt for the plasma center.
   Deputy District Attorney Antonio Barreto Jr. argued at trial
that Markowski knew his blood was tainted. He said the drifter sold
it knowing it might contaminate the plasma pool but didn't care.
   Juror Bill Ferguson of Echo Park said that even though Markowski
knew what he was doing, he was doing it for money, not to poison.
   ``Right now you have to prove specific intent. You have to be
able to prove that a person went down there willfully to poison the
supply. That was not the case in this case,'' Ferguson said.
   ``The legislature has been sitting on their duff in this area
for some time,'' said Barreto. ``We need legislation on this. He
can go out and do this again today, as long as he said `I just did
it for the money.'''
   Prosecutors tried last year to have a law passed that would make
it a felony to knowingly sell or donate AIDS-contaminated blood.
The Assembly failed to approve it, and Reiner said he will push for
it again this year.
   ``Mr. Markowski is today free to do what he did when he was
arrested for the crime,'' Reiner said. ``Will he do it again?
Perhaps. All he needs to do now is adopt an alias.''
   Markowski had allegedly admitted to police that he sold his
blood because he needed money and didn't care about the public, but
Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen ruled the statement inadmissible
because police had not read Markowski his rights to remain silent
and wait for an attorney.
   The detective who interrogated Markowski said he committed the
error because he was so shocked by what Markowski had done.
   Deliberations began Monday after a 10-day trial before Coen.
Jurors returned the verdict Tuesday after deliberating for seven
hours, but it was sealed until Wednesday because O'Brien was unable
to make it to court.
   Reiner originally charged Markowski with attempted murder. But
Coen dismissed those counts, saying the law required a specific
intent to kill that was not present.
   O'Brien said Markowski suffers from mental illness and carries
the AIDS virus but has not developed the disease. The attorney said
Markowski will be placed in a halfway house.
   ``The long-term prognosis at this point is not good. I'd say the
outlook is guarded,'' he said.

   Boys playing in an abandoned railroad
station discovered a dog hanged by its neck from a pipe, the latest
of several such incidents in the area, authorities said Wednesday.
   The dog, a German shepherd mix, had been dead for five or six
months, animal control officer John Holmes said.
   ``It would have to be some type of nut that would take an animal
like that and hang him from a pipe,'' Holmes said.
   The schoolboys told Holmes on Tuesday that they had discovered
several dead dogs in the crumbling Pawtucket-Central Falls station.
   Three years ago, Holmes said, he found a hanged dog in the same
place in the depot. Similar cases have been reported in Cumberland,
Lincoln, and Attleboro, Mass.
   In 1986, a 26-year-old Pawtucket man was charged in connection
with a rash of dog hangings in Cumberland, but he skipped bail
before trial.

   Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture
Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOME SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   New home sales fell 9 percent in January. Sales activity was the
slowest since the last recession ended in December 1982.
   Analysts were surprised by the decline, since sales had already
fallen 6.8 percent in December and 3.4 percent in November.
   The sales downturn was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices.
The median price of a home shot up 9.7 percent to $120,000.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FACTORY ORDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent
in January, the first decline in five months.
   Orders for both durable and non-durable goods dropped to a
seasonally adjusted $212.6 billion following a big 2 percent
increase in December.
   It was the first setback in orders since a 1.4 percent drop in
August, but economists said it showed a return to more normal
demand following the placement of several large orders for jet
aircraft in December.

   The stock market settled for a small gain after a broad early
advance faded. The Dow Jones average, up about 15 points at its
best level of the day, finished with a .83 gain at 2,071.29.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange surged closer to pre-crash levels. The
Nikkei stock average closed at 25,682.82 points, up 246.92 points,
or 0.97 percent from Tuesday's close. Before the October crash, the
index stood at 25,746.56. Volume in the first period of trading was
1.7 billion shares, a record high for this year.

   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound when the
Bank of England sold pounds to keep the British currency below 3.0
West German marks as the mark fell against the dollar. At the end
of the day, one pound cost $1.7680, cheaper than $1.7775 late
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.47 Japanese yen, up from
128.30 Tuesday.

   Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, said deep cuts
in ``entitlement'' programs, which include Social Security and
Medicare, may be the most realistic way for cutting the federal
budget deficit.
   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, also
called for a 15-cent-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax.
   But he said that, in general, tax increases do not appear to be
a feasible way for trimming the budget shortfall, which was $150
billion last year.

   Convinced they had won a $2 million
sweepstakes offered by a California mail-order company, Kathy and
Dale Work bought a pickup truck and a new car and were about to
quit their jobs. Then they learned they hadn't won a thing.
   ``I guess it seems like we're a couple of country hicks,'' said
Mrs. Work. ``We'd made all kinds of plans. I don't know what we're
going to do now.''
   The United States Purchasing Exchange, a company based in the
Pacoima district of Los Angeles that sponsored the sweepstakes,
said Mrs. Work has not won anything _ at least not yet.
   The U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday it had received
complaints about the company and had forwarded them to the Federal
Trade Commission for investigation.
   A man who answered the telephone at a USPE telephone number said
the sweepstakes is still in progress and that Mrs. Work is one of
thousands with a chance at the top prize, said to be more than $2
million. The man would not give his name and would not respond to
other questions.
   Mrs. Work is not the first person to be confused by the
sweepstakes. Debra Long of Pearl City, Mich., woman told reporters
she recently quit her job and vacationed in Las Vagas before
learning she had not won $1.7 million, as she thought.
   Michael Flitcraft, a Chardon, Ohio, truck driver, said he
thought he had won the contest after receiving a letter from the
company on Monday.
   David Carlin of Loeb & Loeb, a New York law firm representing
USPE, issued a statement that disputed the Michigan woman's claim
but did not comment on Mrs. Work's claims.
   ``It is been reported that a prize in excess of $1 million was
won by Miss Debra Long of Pearl City, Mich., in a sweepstakes
sponsored by United States Purchasing Exchange,'' Carlin's
statement said. ``Miss Long reported that she was notified by a
certified letter from the company and she subsequently confirmed
her winnings in a telephone conversation to the company on Feb. 15,
President's Day.
   ``It appears that Miss Long is involved in a trick or hoax
perpetrated by unknown parties, because the company does not notify
winners by certified mail, the company's offices were closed on
President's Day, the company does not request bank account numbers
from winners nor does it require the other information Miss Long
claims was requested of her.''
   Mrs. Work said the company also had requested her bank account
numbers.
   Richard Eppstein, president of the Toledo chapter of the Better
Business Bureau, said the bureau has received at least 20
complaints about USPE's contest over the last few years.
   ``The mail is just chock-full of these kinds of sweepstakes,''
Eppstein said. ``And they are so ... worded that some people think
they have won something when they have not.''
   ``We have received a lot of complaints about the company, mostly
from people who had not received merchandise they ordered from the
company,'' said Linda Russo, occupational support specialist with
the U.S. Postal Service in California.
   Dave Plottner of the regional office of the Federal Trade
Commission in Cleveland declined comment on whether the agency is
investigating USPE.
   Mrs. Work, who lives in Stony Ridge, 10 miles southeast of
Toledo, said she she received a letter from the company in October
that read: ``We are pleased to inform you that you have been
designated to receive certified bank checks from the United States
Purchasing Exchange for $1,894,876 ... your winnings in our
multimillion dollar sweepstakes when you are the grand prize
winner.''
   A few weeks later, another said her winnings stood at $2,024,464.
   Then she received what she thought were two checks: one for $2
million and one for $24,000. She was asked to endorse them and send
them back to the company along with her Social Security and bank
account numbers.
   At that point, the Works thought they were millionaires.
   However, the company's mailing said, ``Certified bank check for
this amount ... will be drawn and issued to Kathy Work upon
verification that the Kathy Work entry has been selected by the
independent judging organization as the prize-winner in accordance
to the rules and regulations set forth and established.''
   The mailed material does not indicate when the sweepstakes
winner will be announced, Mrs. Work said.
   Mrs. Work, who has three children and runs the Country Girl
beauty salon in her home, said she planned to close her business
and her husband considered quitting his job as a crew chief at
Manville Corp. in Waterville.
   ``It doesn't look good, but I'm happy inside,'' she said. ``I
know good is going to come to pass.''

   A bill to require licensing of restaurant
reviewers has been introduced in the Legislature after an owner
complained that her establishment was savaged by a critic who
didn't know a Bolognese sauce from bottled tomato sauce.
   Lawmakers give the measure little chance of passage because of
concerns that it would violate the First Amendment right of free
speech. However, the restaurant industry says debate over the bill
helped accomplish its main purpose.
   ``We wanted to provide a message to reviewers, the public and
some editorial people that ... some of the persons providing the
reviews are less than capable,'' Carroll J. Hughes, executive vice
president of the 700-member Connecticut Restaurant Association,
said Wednesday.
   Hughes persuaded lawmakers to draft the bill after Lucille
Trzcinski, co-owner of Casagrande restaurant in Wallingford,
complained that two ``grossly inaccurate'' reviews last month
caused her business to drop 15-20 percent.
   Hughes said he gets a dozen complaints a year from restaurant
owners about reviews. No state licenses restaurant critics, he said.
   ``We have to stand helplessly by while people are allowed to
make unfounded, unsubstantiated and gratuitous remarks,'' Mrs.
Trzcinski told a legislative committee Tuesday. ``The damage that
these reviews do numbers in the millions of dollars. It is our
business and it is our livelihood.''
   Alan Neigher, an attorney who specializes in media law, called
the proposal ``preposterous.''
   ``It's nothing more than a temper tantrum by some lobbyists and
their clients who don't have an elementary understanding of what
the role of free speech in a free economy is about,'' Neigher said.
``The courts have repeatedly struck down attempts to license the
press.''
   Mrs. Trzcinski, who has operated Casagrande with her husband for
11 years, said her restaurant previously received high marks from
some of the toughest critics in the state for its northern Italian
cuisine.
   She complained that two recent reviewers made numerous mistakes,
even when praising aspects of her menu.
   One mistook a fine loin of veal for a veal pattie and complained
about her bagna cauda, an elegant oil-and-anchovy dip, because he
was expecting a more pedestrian dip, she said.
   Another incorrectly suggested that her Bolognese sauce was
tomato based and flavored with cheese, when it's actually a pork
sauce flavored with a little tomato, Mrs. Trzcinski said.
   ``I would say he probably couldn't recognize a proper Bolognese
because he's familiar with Ragu,'' she said.
   The reviewer also made an ethnic joke about the restaurant's
having a Polish chef, she said.
   The reviewer, who uses the pen name R. Alan Richards in
restaurant reviews for the New Haven Register, said he thought his
review was ``fairly positive'' and blamed the dispute over the
Bolognese sauce on semantics and misinformation supplied by a
waitress.
   ``Licensing opinions is kind of silly,'' said Richards, who has
been reviewing restaurants for seven or eight years. Neither he nor
the New Haven Register would reveal his real name.
   J. Charles Mokrisky, an attorney and the part-time food critic
who complained about the bagna cauda, defended his opinion.
   ``I call 'em the way I see 'em,'' said Mokrisky, who calls
himself a ``food fanatic.''
   Under the proposal, restaurant critics would have to be licensed
through the Department of Consumer Protection. A critic could be
fined $500 for reviewing without a license.
   The proposed license requirements include experience in
food-service operation and management, graduation from a recognized
culinary arts degree program, or a combination of at least six
years of experience and formal training.
   ``I have sympathy for her,'' said Rep. John Wayne Fox,
co-chairman of the General Law Committee that held a public hearing
on the bill. ``But I just was not convinced it was a serious enough
problem that we as a legislature ought to regulate it.''

   A farmer-lawmaker is hoping his colleagues will
hop to it and approve a bill that would give a tax break to frog
farmers.
   Farms for frogs should be exempt from local property taxes, just
like any other place that has ``livestock,'' Conservative Michael
Colvin told a House of Commons committee studying a local finance
bill.
   As now written, the bill defines livestock as ``any mammal or
bird kept for the production of food or wool, or for the purpose of
its use in the farming of land.''
   That's fine for mammals and birds, but where does the frog, an
amphibian, fit in? asked Colvin.
   ``The definition of livestock is most unclear. Times have
changed in agriculture,'' he said, suggesting that the bill
substitute ``creatures'' for ``livestock.''
   ``It would be a sad day if any government started imposing a tax
on frogs,'' said Colvin.

   The Anderson girls _ only two of them related _ may be the first
quintet with the same last name to assemble on court in a Nebraska
high school basketball game.
   The Lady Vikings, 22-1, play Exeter on Thursday in the opening

eight teammates.
   ``Everyone notices it,'' said Becky Anderson, a 5-foot-11-inch

   Becky and her cousin Lori are joined by Collette, Tiffany and
Laura Anderson in the starting lineup.
   Senior Laura is the team's star, averaging 16 points per game.
She says having the same name as four other players on the team
hasn't caused the players any problems. But it's another matter for
announcers.
   ``They get mixed up once in a while,'' she said.
   ``It's easy to tell them apart,'' said Charles Haag, the team's
assistant coach. ``But we definitely have to use first names.''

   Ballet fans beware: A California
legislator is trying to make the West Coast Swing, a space-saving
variant of the jitterbug, the official state dance.
   Under state Sen. Quentin Kopp's bill, the West Coast Swing would
join the ranks of gold, serpentine rocks, the desert tortoise,
dog-faced butterfly and the saber-toothed tiger _ all officially
recognized symbols of the Golden State.
   Gold is the state mineral, serpentine the state rock, desert
tortoise the state reptile, dog-faced butterfly the state insect
and the saber-toothed tiger the state fossil.
   ``West Coast Swing is an intricate dance, requiring a great deal
of coordination, good timing and intelligent application,'' Kopp, a
San Francisco independent, wrote to fellow lawmakers recently.
   According to Oakland businessman Walter Harmon, who approached
Kopp with the idea of honoring the dance, West Coast Swing is a
variation of the jitterbug, a jazz dance.
   The variation was developed because it takes up less room than
the freewheeling jitterbug, and thus more couples can dance on a
smaller floor, said Harmon.
   ``It's a very complex, very beautiful dance,'' said Harmon,
legislative liaison director for the United States Swing Dance
Council.
   He also claims it is the only indigenous California dance to
survive in essentially its original form, and is thus worthy of
historical recognition and preservation.

   John Ehrlichman, a former White House aide
who spent time in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal,
says his assignment covering the impeachment trial of Gov. Evan
Mecham for Rolling Stone magazine is ``a match made in heaven.''
   ``I'm working on a novel and it has an impeachment scene in it,
so I was going to come over and and take a look at this, anyway,''
Ehrlichman said Tuesday. ``It's a ready-made opportunity to
observe. Secondly, it's a subject that intrigues me. I certainly
have some feel for the underlying issues.''
   Ehrlichman, a former top-ranking official for President Richard
Nixon, resigned from his White House post in April 1973 and was
convicted in 1975 for obstruction of justice, conspiracy and
perjury in the attempted cover-up of the Watergate burglary.
   Ehrlichman, 63, spent 18 months at Swift Trail Camp, a
minimum-security federal prison south of Safford, Ariz., and was
released in 1978.
   He now lives in Santa Fe, N.M., and is working on his seventh
novel, a story about a fictional U.S. president.
   Ehrlichman said he sees few correlations between the problems of
Nixon and Mecham.
   ``Here is a fellow (Mecham) with a criminal proceeding, an
impeachment and a recall all going on at the same time, all pretty
much bottomed on the same facts,'' said Ehrlichman. ``I think it's
very different (from Watergate). It raises all kinds of interesting
legal questions about double jeopardy and things like that.''

   More than 60 anti-apartheid demonstrators were
arrested Wednesday following a peaceful protest in front of the
South African embassy.
   The arrests followed a rally protesting the South African
government's decision to outlaw public dissent, which led to the
arrest last week of Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond
Tutu in Johannesburg.
   Randall Robinson, a leader of the Free South Africa Movement
which has organized similar protests at the South African embassy
since 1984, told a crowd of about 300 people that the demonstration
marked ``the beginning of a new phase of the battle against
apartheid.''
   The rally was held down the street from the embassy to avoid
violation of a District of Columbia ordinance prohibiting
demonstrations within 500 feet of foreign embassies.
   Following remarks by members of Congress, representives from the
National Organization for Women, the AFL-CIO and other groups, a
group of ``messengers'' approached the embassy.
   Among those arrested were Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.; Del. Walter
Fauntroy, D-D.C.; U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Mary F. Berry; and
Robinson, who heads TransAfrica, a Washington-based lobbying group
on Africa and the Caribbean.
   Robinson said the Free South Africa Movement would continue to
push for complete disinvestment of U.S. firms in South Africa and
urge Congress to enact stronger sanctions.
   He said America needs to move ``the U.N. Security Council toward
global sanctions and a president who will take the lead with our
allies ...to totally isolate South Africa.''
   Robinson said he hoped the new wave of protests would force
presidential candidates to take a public position on South Africa.
He said only Jesse Jackson has been vocal on the issue thus far.

<TEXT>
   Prodded by the Food and Drug
Administration, pharmaceutical companies agreed Wednesday to avoid
any advertising that claims aspirin can help prevent a first heart
attack, despite a report in a medical journal that drew this
conclusion.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young announced the agreement after he
met for more than an hour with company representatives who came to
his office in this Washington suburb after he sent a letter
reminding of the FDA's power to regulate.
   At a news conference, Young said he had told the manufacturers
that if they promoted their products for a use not supported by an
FDA analysis, they could be guilty of mislabeling, and ``this
mislabeling can lead to regulatory action by the FDA.''
   He said the manufacturers agreed to ``exercise voluntary
restraint'' and to refrain ``from further promotion'' of aspirin as
a protection against first heart attack. But Young insisted that
the action was not in response to ads that already have run.
   The commissioner said he was ``so busy'' in his job that he
never read, listened or watched advertising and thus did not know
if any ads run that violated the FDA position have been run.
   He also said that no one had brought such ads to his attention.
   William C. MacLeod, director of consumer protection at the
Federal Trade Commission, which regulates drug advertising, refused
repeatedly at the news conference to say if his agency had taken
any action regarding ads by aspirin manufacturers. Nor would he
confirm that inappropriate ads had been run.
   Young said the meeting was prompted by the publicity surrounding
a study published Jan. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   In the study, more than 11,000 physicians over the age of 40
took one aspirin every other day, while another group of physicians
took placebos, or fake aspirin. At the end of 57 months, the study
showed that those taking aspirin had a 47 percent fewer heart
attacks.
   While refusing to say if the action was prompted by any ad that
has run, Young said the drug manufacturers had agreed to
voluntarily ``refrain from further promotion of the study results.''
   In a Feb. 24 letter, Young ``invited'' the drug manufacturers to
attend a meeting at his FDA office to discuss the aspirin findings.
   He wrote of his concern that ``the dissemination of certain
types of information is clearly premature'' until the FDA has
analyzed the aspirin study and established ``appropriate'' labeling
for use of the over-the-counter medication for the prevention of
first heart attacks.
   The invitation letter also cited the federal law that forbids
mislabeling of drugs.
   Young said he told the manufacturers that all ads making any
claims for uses of aspirin not approved by the FDA were to be
halted.
   ``From this time forward, any ads in the pipeline will not be
grandfathered (escape enforcement),'' said Young.
   Both Young and McLeod repeatedly declined to say if any
advertising was being canceled as a result of the FDA action, and
the agerncy did not identify the drug manufacturers attending the
meeting.
   Most of those leaving the private meeting refused comment. An
exception was Dr. Edward Henry of Squibb Pharmaceutical Products,
who would say only, ``We're all in agreement. It was a very good
meeting.''
   Marie-Claude Stockl, public affairs director for Bristol-Myers,
said in a statement later: ``We agree with the FDA that the final
results need to be reviewed by the agency before communicating the
use of aspirin for primary heart attack, and our actions to date
have been consistent with that position.''
   Several drug companies have produced ads that promoted the use
of aspirin to help prevent a second heart attack. These were based
on a 1985 study that was analyzed by the FDA. This earlier study
has been incorporated in the agency's professional labeling
statement on aspirin.
   But the study announced in January was the first to show
evidence that aspirin could help prevent a primary, or first, heart
attack.
   Young said his concern is that the aspirin study involved a
narrow group _ all physicians in good health _ and that an analysis
of the study had not been completed.
   The FDA said the aspirin therapy is not appropriate for everyone
and ``could do more harm than good'' for some. Young said the study
showed that some subjects experienced stroke.
   He also said the aspirin therapy could harm the health of people
with high blood pressure, gout, kidney or liver disease or peptic
ulcer. Aspirin also can cause intestinal bleeding, he said.
   ``This study used a healthy population of phsycians who could
take their own blood pressure and who knew how to recognize
intestinal bleeding,'' said Young, and widespread use by patients
without medical supervision could lead to serious complications.
   Young said it will take about six months for the FDA to analyze
the study and then publish new professional labeling for aspirin.

<HEAD>Some Ford Employees May Not Recieve Profit-Sharing Checks on Time</HEAD>

   Ford Motor Co. will comply with a court order and
withhold profit-sharing checks scheduled to go to about 1,850
workers who are behind on child support payments, the automaker
said Wednesday.
   ``We're not a stakeholder in this. It's strictly between the
individuals involved and Wayne County,'' said Ford spokesman Mike
Moran.
   The order was issued by Circuit Judge Richard Kaufman on
Tuesday, four days after Friend of the Court of Wayne County filed
suit to obtain profit-sharing money in an effort to improve child
support collection.
   Friend of the Court, which is involved with domestic relations
cases and is affiliated with Circuit Court, ``has an obligation to
insure compliance with child support orders,'' said its director,
Gerhard F. Ritsema.
   The checks are to be distributed Tuesday and are expected to
average a record $3,700. More than 160,000 Ford employees received
the previous record profit-sharing checks of $2,100 in 1986.
   According to the court order, Friend of the Court will have
eight weeks to settle the 1,850 cases.
   Ritsema said eight weeks would be sufficient for Wayne County's
35 Circuit Court judges to decide how much of each profit-sharing
check will be given to the agency, adding that he hoped some people
would opt to settle without a hearing.
   About $155 million in child support was collected in 1987, but
80 percent of the 225,000 parents supposedly paying child support
are in arrears, Ritsema said. He said the agency's action against
Ford employees could bring in as much as $4 million.
   Kaufman's action disappointed many Ford workers. Four employees
told the judge that child support already is being deducted from
their pay. They said the agency should increase the deduction from
their regular paychecks instead of going after their profit-sharing
checks.
   ``The profit-sharing check is what we've realized after going
eight years without a raise and turning Ford Motor Company
around,'' said Robert Morris Jr., a 10-year Ford employee.
   Friend of the Court is considering increasing the amount
deducted from regular paychecks, Ritsema said. But he said any such
action would be in addition to pursuing profit-sharing money.
   Friend of the Court in Washtenaw County has also moved to obtain
profit-sharing money from Ford workers who are behind on child
support payments, Moran said.
   He added that Ford has rejected all 150 names on a list
submitted by the southeastern Michigan county agency, saying that
not enough data was supplied for the automaker to verify the
agency's claims.

<HEAD>Army Stops Random Drug Testing of Civilians, But Seeks Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army said Wednesday it had stopped random
drug testing for civilian workers to comply with a court ruling,
but was asking the Justice Department to appeal the judgment.
   The service, in a brief statement, said it would limit its
civilian drug testing for the time being to those instances in
which ``there is a reasonable suspicion that a specific employee is
under the influence of drugs while on duty.''
   Testing on a random basis, however, has been halted for now, the
service added.
   The move follows a decision in U.S. District Court in Washington
on Tuesday in which a judge ruled that random drug testing amounted
to an unreasonable search prohibited by the Constitution.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said random checks of
employees in so-called sensitive positions could not be justified
by safety concerns, because the urine test used by the Army did not
indicate whether an employee was using drugs on the job.
   ``The Army has asked the Department of Justice to appeal the
ruling,'' the service said in its statement. ``The Army has also
requested that Justice ask for a stay of the judge's order during
the appeal process.''
   Hogan's ruling had no effect on the right of the armed forces to
conduct random drug tests of active-duty personnel.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
told Congress on Wednesday it should consider trimming Social
Security and other entitlement programs as it searches for ways to
reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Saying that such guaranteed-benefit programs ``account for
nearly half of total outlays,'' Greenspan held out little hope for
major deficit reductions in other areas _ although he did propose a
15-cent gasoline tax.
   ``Several rounds of deficit-reduction efforts already have taken
care of the easy cuts,'' Greenspan told the Senate Budget
Committee, which is considering President Reagan's $1.09 trillion
budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Greenspan said entitlement expenses, which include Social
Security, Medicare, Medicaid and various forms of welfare, will
rise dramatically in the early 21st century because of the
``increase in the beneficiary population.''
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., told Greenspan: ``Baby boomers are
going to be in for a big surprise when it's time for them to start
collecting Social Security.'' Baby boomers is the phrase given to
the bulge in population from those born after World War II and into
the mid-1960s.
   Greenspan, who as a private citizen chaired a bipartisan
commission that helped overhaul Social Security financing in the
early part of this decade, did not specify exactly which programs
he would cut.
   But he said the effect of cuts in entitlement programs made now
would be amplfied in years to come. He noted that some 38 million
Americans, or about 15 percent of the poplulation, ``are collecting
Social Security retirmenet or disability benefits.''
   Despite the political problems associated with trimming benefit
programs such as Social Security, Greenspan told the committee:
``All the alternatives are known. The choices are political, not
economic.''
   ``I wish you well. And I don't think you need me to tell you how
to go about it,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration has projected a fiscal 1988 budget
deficit of $146.74 billion. The Congressional Budget Office,
however, says it's likely to be about $157 billion, substantially
above the $144 billion target called for in the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   President Reagan's budget recommendations for 1989 projects a
1989 deficit of $129.5 billion.
   Social Security spending is projected to reach $214.7 billion
for the year, compared with $202.4 billion for 1987.
   Other Health and Human Services programs, including Medicare and
Medicaid, spent $50.51 billion in the first four months of 1988,
compared with $49.43 billion in the same period of 1987.
   Interest payments on the $2.2 trillion national debt are
expected to total $210.06 billion in fiscal 1988, accounting for 20
percent of total federal spending.
   Greenspan suggested that not much more could be expected in the
way of deficit reduction from further defense cuts or general tax
increases.
   Defense spending is approaching ``maintenance levels,''
Greenspan said. And, as to new taxes, he testifed, ``there are
upside limits to the share of income that can be taxed.''
   ``For several decades, the overall federal tax bite has been
fairly flat, at a bit less than 20 percent of gross national
product. ... This stability is not a coinicidence but is indicative
of the public's aversion to rising tax burdens.''
   However, he suggested that a new 15-cent-a-gallon levy on
gasoline prices would help ease the deficit in a small way, and
might even promote more energy conservation.
   In other testimony, Greenspan said:
   _Even if the Fed wanted to drive down interest rates sharply at
this time, ``we would find we would fail,'' because markets would
likely resist such a move and ``would run away from us.'
   _Trade deficit improvements, led by higher import prices and
surging exports, would continue even at current exchange-rate
levels of the dollar.
   _There was some danger of increased inflation in the coming
months, but higher prices do ``not appear to be on the order of a
magnitude that should cause concern.''
   _``There are no secret agreements'' among industrial nations
involving interest rate levels in the United States that might be
needed to support the goal of a stabilizing the U.S. dollar at its
current rate of exchange.

<HEAD>Robertson's War-Record Accuser Says He's ``Chickening Out'' Again</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS that Robertson not ready to pay court costs,

   Pat Robertson wants to drop his libel suit
against a former congressman who questioned his war record because
going to trial now would ``sacrifice his presidential campaign,''
his lawyer said Wednesday. But Robertson's accuser declared, ``He's
chickening out of the trial just like he chickened out 37 years
ago.''
   Former Rep. Paul McCloskey, R-Calif., who has accused Robertson
of using his father's political influence to avoid combat duty in
the Korean War, has said in recent weeks he wouldn't settle the
suit unless Robertson paid the costs, which McCloskey estimates at
$400,000, of defending against the suit.
   The trial, set to begin on Tuesday, when Robertson hopes to do
well in delegate-rich Southern primaries, would force him off the
campaign trail for three weeks, attorney Douglas Rigler said.
   In dropping the lawsuit ``Robertson does not intend to back away
at any time from his denial of the charges that Mr. McCloskey
made,'' Rigler said.
   He said that ``it is quite possible that Mr. Robertson will be
asked to pay a substantial amount of court costs'' to cover the
expenses of taking depositions from more than 50 witnesses.
   But Rigler said he would likely appeal any such decision by U.S.
District Judge Joyce Hens Green. He also suggested the $400,000
defense estimate of costs ``may be an artificial figure'' that
includes lawyers' fees that Robertson should not have to pay.
   McCloskey's lawyer, George Lehner, said that, if anything, the
defense estimate of its costs is ``artificially low.''
   Lehner said he will ask the judge to order Robertson to go to
trial on Tuesday or force him to pay court costs as well as
attorneys' fees.
   Rigler said Robertson will ask dismissal of the lawsuit because
``he is being asked to sacrifice his presidential campaign in order
to vindicate his personal honor.''
   Robertson, in South Carolina, said Wednesday he wanted to press
ahead with the suit but couldn't be in court and out campaigning
for the Republican presidential nomination at the same time.
   ``If the judge will give me about another month, I'd love to go
into it,'' Robertson said.
   The judge in January refused Roberton's request to postpone the
trial until June 20.
   ``I can't understand why a respected judge did it,'' Rigler
said. ``We think it is unfair.''
   Under rules of civil procedure, a plaintiff cannot drop a case
without the defendant's consent once the lawsuit has been answered
or without a court order dismissing the case.
   McCloskey, commenting Wednesday on CBS-TV, said, ``The
courtroom's a great place to learn the truth. Now that he's up with
the truth to be told and testimony under oath, he's backing off.''
   ``I think the truth ought to be told. I don't know any better
place to get the truth than in the courtroom. He invoked the
process, he ought to go through with it,'' McCloskey said.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1986 following publication of
McCloskey's allegations that Robertson used the influence of his
late father, Sen. A. Willis Robertson, D-Va., to avoid combat duty
in the Korean War.
   McCloskey, a decorated Marine combat veteran who was aboard a
troop ship from which Robertson was removed in 1951 during a
stopover in Japan, also charged that Robertson later served as the
``booze officer'' to a rear echelon unit after he did go to Korea.
   A number of former Marines have come forward since the lawsuit
was filed to support McCloskey, though other witnesses deny that
Robertson invoked his father's political influence to be get his
temporary reassignment to a special training unit in Japan.
   McCloskey said Wednesday that one reason he made the charges was
that he feared a person who had avoided combat might try to make
amends by becoming more warlike in later years.
   ``When you get a president in office who has evaded combat in
his youth and all his advisers are saying `look tough against the
Soviets' ... I think there is a tendency to try to prove your
manhood late in life,'' he said.
   ``A man like Robertson wants to take on the commies anywhere
they are, anywhere in the world,'' McCloskey said. It's ``a little
dangerous to have a man like that in the White House.''
   Rigler invited McCloskey to submit the dispute over Robertson's
war record to an independent arbitrator, saying, ``If he refuses to
agree to arbitration, it is Mr. McCloskey who is afraid to have a
determination of the facts.''
   Lehner said Tuesday that Robertson's attorneys rejected the idea
of arbitration last fall when he informally suggested it.

   Fingerprints found in a book about poisons match
those of a woman accused of killing her husband by putting cyanide
in a non-prescription drug, according to court papers released
Wednesday.
   A memorandum filed by U.S. Attorney Gene S. Anderson also said
Stella Nickell had failed a lie-detector test ``on whether she was
the Excedrin killer'' and that she apparently forged her husband's
signature on life insurance applications.
   Mrs. Nickell is charged in the deaths of Bruce Nickell, 52, and
Susan Katherine Snow, 40, both of Auburn. Both died in June 1986
after swallowing tainted capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin.
Authorities have not suggested any other links between the victims.
   Mrs. Nickell was indicted in December on two counts of causing a
death by product tampering and three counts of tampering with a
product involved in interstate commerce. She has pleaded innocent.
   Mrs. Nickell checked out a book on poisoning from a library in
mid-1984 without returning it, and pages on cyanide poisoning in a
book titled ``Deadly Harvest'' that was found on a library shelf
bore 84 fingerprints and three palm prints belonging to Mrs.
Nickell, court documents said.
   The prosecutor's memo said the defendant and her husband, Bruce
Nickell, had experienced ``intensified marital discord'' just
before his death _ an assertion strongly disputed by Ms. Nickell's
court-appointed defense attorney.
   In accompanying documents, federal public defender Thomas
Hillier II also disputed the government's claim that the polygraph
test was conclusive.
   The maximum penalty on each death count is life, and the other
charges carry maximum terms of 10 years. Trial has been set for
April 18.
   The prosecutor's memo, filed in support of the government's
motion that Mrs. Nickell remain in custody pending trial, and
accompanying documents had been sealed by U.S. District Judge
William S. Dwyer because of concern that release of the information
might make it harder to obtain an unbiased jury.
   The Seattle Times, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Morning News
Tribune of Tacoma appealed the order, which was overturned Monday
by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Tainted capsules of pain relievers were found in both victims'
homes and in bottles on the shelves of two stores in the suburbs
between Seattle and Tacoma.
   Mrs. Nickell had sued Excedrin's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers,
and two stores where tainted capsules were found after an insurance
carrier refused to pay benefits on her husband's death.
   Shortly before he died, Nickell obtained a life insurance policy
that would pay his wife $31,000 if he died of natural causes and
$136,000 for an accidental death.
   In September and October 1985, Ms. Nickell applied for two other
life insurance policies for a total of $40,000, with she and her
husband each the beneficiary of the other.
   ``Handwriting examination has definitely concluded that Bruce
Nickell did not sign what purports to be his signature,''
Anderson's memo says. ``Bruce Nickell's fingerprints were not found
on either insurance application.
   ``Stella Nickell's fingerprints were found in one of the two
applications, and handwriting analysis conclusively established
that she signed her husband's name to one application and probably
signed his name to the second application.''

<TEXT>
   A state prosecutor and a former U.N. human rights
delegate from Nicaragua announced their defection Wednesday and
accused the Sandinista government of torture, keeping political
prisoners and rigging the judiciary.
   Ivan Villavicencio said he had been an appeals prosecutor in the
district of Managua, the capital, since March 1983.
   Norman Jose Miranda, a Foreign Ministry official for eight
years, was an alternative representative at the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in Geneva during 1985-87 and said he left Nicaragua to
avoid holding the same post this year.
   The two men called a news conference to announce their
``resignation,'' timed to coincide with the U.N. commission's
annual session.
   Both said they remained Sandinista supporters, but were
disillusioned with the leftist government's ``deception'' of the
Nicaraguan people.
   They said they moved to the United States, where they have
family and friends, in the last three months and would resign
officially shortly.
   Villavicencio said Nicaraguan jails hold 8,600 political
prisoners and said torture is used against peasants opposing
government policies.
   He said a ``reprehensible permanent alliance'' exists between
police and judicial authorities and judges are pressured to convict
on the basis of fabricated charges. The government is pushing a
pilot project to hand over the administration of justice to
political commissars, he said.
   Miranda said Nicaragua is undergoing a ``Stalinist social
drama.''
   He said the Nicaraguan delegation at the Human Rights Commission
in fact took instructions from delegates of allies, such as Cuba.
   The Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua in a 1979 revolution
that toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza. U.S.-backed rebels have
been fighting the government since 1981.

<HEAD>Provision Of Civil Procedure Spotlighted In Robertson Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Robertson-Libel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision by GOP presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson to seek dismissal of his libel suit against a congressman
who questioned his war record calls into play an arcane provision
of civil procedure in federal courts.
   Rule 41 governs the dismissal of lawsuits by plaintiffs once the
defendant has answered the complaint.
   A plaintiff can obtain dismissal of the suit voluntarily if he
gets a signed stipulation from the defendant.
   Without such a stipulation, as in Robertson's lawsuit against
former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif., the plaintiff can ask
for a court-ordered dismissal.
   Robertson's lawyers said Wednesday they will ask U.S. District
Judge Joyce Hens Green to order dismissal of the case under this
provision which provides that the case can be dismissed ``upon
order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court
deems proper.''
   Robertson's lawyer, Douglas Rigler, said his client expects to
be ordered to pay McCloskey's court costs to cover the expenses of
taking depositions from witnesses.
   But Rigler said he doesn't believe his client should pay such
costs or attorney's fees and he would likely appeal such an order
if it were made by U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green.
   McCloskey's lawyer, George Lehner, says the judge has the
discretion to order Robertson to pay both his client's court costs
and attorney's fees. Lehner says if the judge refuses his request
to go to trial on Tuesday, he will ask her to order Robertson to
pay both court costs and attorney's fees, which he says total more
than $400,000.
   Rigler conceded that an award of attorney's fees is always a
possibilty but he said Robertson's lawsuit doesn't ``fall within
that category of cases'' in which such an award is appropriate.
   Such cases includes lawsuits that are brought in bad faith or to
harass the defendant.
   The judge has already refused to dismiss the case in McCloskey's
motion to dismiss the case, ruling that Robertson is entitled to go
to trial on his charges that he was libeled by the former
congressman.
   Robertson charges that McCloskey defamed him by charging he used
the political influence of his late father, Sen. A. Willis
Robertson, D-Va., to avoid combat during the Korean War.

   Iraq and Iran battered each other's
capitals with long-range missiles for a third day Wednesday and the
first Iraqi rockets of the 7{-year-old war crashed into Qom, seat
of the Iranian religious hierarchy.
   Iran reported no casualties in Qom, a holy city of 250,000 where
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once made his home. The 87-year-old
revolutionary patriarch has lived for several years in Jamaran, a
northern Tehran suburb.
   The Iraqis said they fired eight surface-to-surface missiles
Wednesday, two of them into Qom, bringing the total for three days
to 24. Iran said it hit Baghdad with three missiles, for a total of
eight in the same period.
   ``Fear not,'' Khomeini told Iranians in remarks quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency. ``It does not make any
difference for a people who seek martyrdom whether they are killed
by missiles, tanks or artillery.''
   Both sides reported civilian casualties in their capital cities,
and Iran said Iraqi warplanes also raided a village near Rasht 150
miles northeast of Tehran. IRNA said ``several civilians'' were
killed Wednesday in Tehran and bombs destroyed the mosque in the
village.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency said the Iranian rockets
killed or wounded civilians and demolished houses and shops in
residential neighborhoods of the Arab capital, but was not more
specifics.
   Iran said Wednesday's hits on Tehran wounded 15 people, bringing
the total to 115. Before the general report about casualties in
Tehran, it had reported 27 killed in the capital and five in the
village near Rasht.
   It said casualties included two newlyweds killed in the village
and an 80-year-old woman wounded in Tehran.
   Western military analysts believe Iraq uses Soviet-made Scud-B
missiles fitted with strap-on boosters enabling them to reach
Tehran, which is 290 miles from the border. Qom is roughly the same
distance from the frontier.
   Iran's weapons also are Scud-Bs, provided by its Arab allies
Syria and Libya, but without boosters because Baghdad is only 80
miles from the border.
   This week's attacks by Iraq are its first on Tehran and Qom with
surface-to-surface missiles. President Saddam Hussein's government
declared in August it had acquired missiles that could reach the
Iranian capital, a city of 6 million people.
   The Iraqi air force, which has an estimated 8-1 advantage over
Iran's, has made many raids on Iranian cities and bombed Qom
repeatedly in January 1987.
   Thousands of civilian lives have been lost in the ``war of the
cities,'' the periodic rounds of bombing and missile attacks in a
conflict that has claimed at least 1 million casualties since it
began in September l980.
   Iran said its artillery batteries, in response to the rocketing
of Tehran, shelled military and economic installations in the Iraqi
cities of Basra, Ammara, Badra, Zorbatiya, Ali Sharqi and Ali
Gharbi.
   Dispatches from Iraq said its warplanes bombed the western
Iranian town of Dezful and Karaj, a city near Tehran, setting their
targets ablaze. Iran did not report the raids.
   Iraq said it began the missile barrage of Tehran in retaliation
for two Iranian rockets that hit Baghdad before dawn Monday. Iran
described the missiles as a response to Iraqi air raids on the
Tehran oil refinery last week.

<HEAD>300 Austrians File Complaint Against Waldheim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of citizens asked for a ruling
Wednesday on whether President Kurt Waldheim's war record warrants
murder charges, and Waldheim ordered the seizure of a magazine that
published the complaint.
   The left-wing weekly Falter printed a text of the complaint by
the 300 Austrians along with three articles critical of the
president, who has been accused of committing war crimes while
serving as a German army lieutenant in the Balkans during World War
II.
   Under Article 63 of Austria's Constitution, the president cannot
be prosecuted unless both houses of Parliament approve.
   Waldheim's office said he instructed the state prosecutor's
office to impound copies of the magazine on grounds the issue
damaged his honor.
   Police said late Wednesday they had not yet received a judge's
order to act.
   Waldheim says he is innocent of war crimes.
   Walter Oswalt, a journalist and spokesman for the group making
the complaint, said it was delivered to the prosecutor's office
Wednesday morning. A spokesman for the office said privacy laws
prevented him from confirming such a document was received.
   Gerhard Litzka, spokesman for the Justice Ministry, said
prosecutors must investigate any such complaint and tell the
ministry whether there are grounds for legal action.
   As grounds for an investigation of possible charges, the
complaint cited a law that says both those who commit crimes and
those who assist in them can be held responsible for criminal acts.
   It quoted extensively from the report last month by an
international panel of historians saying Waldheim was in ``close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, knew of them and did nothing to
stop them. The historians said they found no proof that the former
U.N. secretary-general committed war crimes, but left the question
of guilt open.
   Waldheim has said the historians exonerated him from the
accusations of war crimes which arose during the presidential
election campaign two years ago.
   The complaint also quoted from an interview printed Feb. 25 by
the Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung with Manfred Messerschmidt, a
West German historian who served on the panel.
   Messerschmidt, who has legal training, said steps could be
considered in connection with Waldheim's role in the fate of six
British commandos executed by the Nazis in Greece in 1944. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher ordered British authorities last month
to reopen an investigation of the case.
   Israeli historian Yehuda L. Wallach said Feb. 9 he thought the
panel's report could serve as the basis of an investigation of
whether to prosecute Waldheim.

<TEXT>
   A national lawyers group Wednesday joined a
challenge to federal sentencing guidelines that require judges to
impose prison terms of particular lengths for certain crimes.
   The guidelines, established by a congressional commission,
violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, says a
friend-of-the-court brief filed by the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers.
   The association joined a challenge filed by Assistant Federal
Public Defender Stewart Abrams, who represents a woman with no
criminal record who under the guidelines must receive at least 6{
years in prison for smuggling cocaine.
   A judge may go outside the guidelines, which create a 43-level
system of punishment based on the crime and defendant's record,
only in extreme cases.
   U.S. District Judge James King, chief of the Southern District
of Florida, said all 15 federal judges in his district will rule
together on the matter to avoid discrepancies from courtroom to
courtroom. No hearing date has been set.
   It will be the first time the judges have sat together since
they considered the immigration of 125,000 Cubans to Florida during
the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   The sentencing guidelines have been challenged on constitutional
grounds three times in the Southern District of California since
Feb. 18 with different results, said NACDL representative Benson B.
Weintraub.
   In the test case, Beverly Bogle, 21, was arrested after her
arrival at Miami International Airport from Jamaica on Nov. 11 with
1.9 kilograms of cocaine she was carrying for someone else, Abrams
said.
   ``She was not profiting from it,'' he said. ``She was doing it
for a person she perceived to be a friend.''
   Ms. Bogle pleaded guilty to importing cocaine and has been
jailed while awaiting sentencing March 25.
   Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Congress set a minimum
sentence of five years in prison for the offense.
   However, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, created in 1984, set a
guideline ranging from six years and seven months to eight years
and one month in prison for the crime, Abrams said. The guidelines
apply to crimes committed after Nov. 1.
   In Ms. Bogle's case, the federal probation office wants to use
the commission's guidelines, Abrams said.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. on Wednesday
chose R.H. Macy & Co. over a rival suitor, agreeing to a marriage
that would put famous retailers such as Macy, Bloomingdale's and
Bullock's under one enormous corporate roof.
   A rejected Campeau Corp. said it would proceed with its bid for
Federated, the nation's fifth largest retailer.
   Federated said in a joint statement with Macy, the nation's 10th
largest general retail concern, that the two companies had signed a
definitive agreement to create a new company, Macy's-Federated Inc.
   Macy operates 96 stores in 14 states, while Federated has 650
stores _ including Bloomingdale's, Bullocks and Filene's _ in 36
states.
   Federated's choice of Macy over Campeau came as no surprise.
   Analysts noted that the Macy bid offered Federated the
opportunity for future growth, while Campeau would bring with it a
history of having bought and broken up Allied Stores Corp.
   No matter who ends up controlling Federated, the new owner is
expected to sell its Gold Circle discount stores and Ralphs
supermarkets.
   Several of Federated's department store chains, which include
Burdine's, I. Magnin., Rich's, Abraham & Straus and Lazarus, also
are expected to be sold after a purchase by either Macy or Campeau.
   Abraham and Straus and Rich's were considered likely candidates
for a sale by Macy, because they are direct competitors with Macy
stores in New York and Atlanta, respectively.
   The agreement provides for Macy to begin a cash tender offer of
$74.50 a share for about 80 percent of Federated's 89.6 million
outstanding shares, or a total of $5.25 billion, the companies said.
   The remaining Federated shares would be exchanged for stock in
the new company.
   Federated's current management would have a strong voice in the
new company, filling 40 percent of the seats on its board of
directors.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based real estate developer and retailer,
through its Allied Stores division, owns the Jordan Marsh, Stern's,
Ann Taylor and Maas Brothers chains.
   The retailer said in a statement that Macy's bid was ``not
competitive and we intend to prevail in the marketplace.''
   Late Wednesday, Campeau said it was amending its previously
announced $66 cash tender offer. It said it would pay $75 per share
in cash for 80 percent of Federated's shares, and after a merger
would pay $44 per share for the remaining 20 percent.
   Campeau said its latest proposal, which was to expire March 15,
had a combined value of $68 per share and a total value of $6.1
billion.
   The amended Campeau bid was announced after the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, where Federated stock fell $1 a
share to $66.75.
   Earlier, Campeau repeated a charge that the Macy offer was
highly speculative because of the unknown value of the stock. Macy
is currently privately held, and it is difficult to know how much
its shares are worth.
   Wall Street analysts said they found it hard to predict what
shareholders would do, given the problem of putting a value on the
stock portion of the offer.
   ``If you don't know that, it's really tough to figure out which
is a better deal,'' said Joseph Ronning, a retail industry analyst
with Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
   Macy's bid, which came to light Monday, was originally for
$73.80 a share in cash plus stock, but the offer was increased
before the agreement was reached.
   Macy was taken private by a management group in a $3.6 billion
leveraged buyout in 1986. Its stores rang up $5.21 billion in sales
during the fiscal year ended last Aug. 1.
   Federated Chairman Howard Goldfeder said at a news conference
Wednesday he would resign after helping Macy Chairman Edward
Finkelstein implement the merger.
   Goldfeder said he expects to be paid $3.06 million when he
leaves the company under a ``golden parachute'' approved by
Federated's directors. Similar departure payments are due other top
Federated officers.
   The nation's four largest retailers are Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
with $30.21 billion in sales during fiscal 1987; K mart Corp.,
$25.63 billion; Wal-Mart Stores Inc., $15.96 billion, and J.C.
Penney Co. _ $13.98 billion.

   Federal regulators' failure to require
Volkswagen of America to make public reports of sudden acceleration
in Audi 5000 cars appears to be a case of intentional deception, a
New York congressman said Wednesday.
   Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., in letter to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Volkswagen, demanded the
documents be turned over to Congress, bypassing the agency
responsible for the Audi investigation.
   ``As a result of NHTSA's apparent cooperation with (Volkswagen),
the public has been denied the opportunity to study significant
evidence which might highlight the ineffectiveness of a shift-lock
device in the Audi 5000 to curtail sudden acceleration incidents,''
Hochbrueckner wrote. ``I find this deceptive behavior a shocking
departure from the established practices in these matters.''
   NHTSA in January 1987 ordered a recall of 255,336 1978-86 Audi
5000s for installation of a device to fix reported throttle
problems on the cars.
   The agency has received 1,750 complaints of alleged sudden
acceleration in Audi 5000s, resulting in 1,269 accidents, 430
injuries and five deaths.
   Hochbrueckner said NHTSA requested the incident reports in June
1987. However, the documents were never turned over to NHTSA, which
instead received summaries from VW, Hochbrueckner said, calling the
arrangement unprecedented.
   Volkswagen issued a statement in response saying that ``NHTSA
has not given us any special concessions, neither have we been
relieved of any of the burden of responding to the agencies'
requests for information.''
   A NHTSA memorandum filed in the Audi case said that at VW's
request, ``the source documents were reviewed by (NHTSA) personnel
and the summaries were found to be accurate summations of the very
bulky source documents.''
   An NHTSA official said Wednesday there had been other instances
in which the agency had requested summaries of complaints rather
than the complaints themselves. The official, speaking only on
condition he not be named, was unable to say how common the
practice was.
   Volkswagen's spokesman at its U.S. headquarters in Troy, Mich.,
Joseph Bennett, did not return calls for comment.
   Hochbrueckner asked Volkswagen to give Congress all the owner
reports, consumer complaints, surveys, investigations, field
reports or other sources ``received or authorized by Volkswagen, or
of which Volkswagen is otherwise aware'' during and after the
recall.
   Congress has no power to compel the documents be turned over,
said Andy Kennedy, an aide to Hochbrueckner.
   Volkswagen said it ``will comply with Congressman
Hockbreuchner's request for the data by making available to him all
the data which we furnished to NHTSA on the same schedule.''

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Leftist guerrillas killed 14 people in
three raids this week, part of the rebels' biggest offensive yet in
Colombia, authorities and news accounts said Wednesday.
   About 100 rebels attacked Pelaya town, about 250 miles north of
Bogota, on Tuesday night, Alfredo Araujo said in a broadcast
interview with the Colombian radio chain RCN.
   Araujo, administrative assistant to the Cesar state government
office, said the attackers stormed a police station, killed two
officers and injured five people.
   The daily El Tiempo of Bogota reported that leftist guerrillas
murdered eight peasants Tuesday in the Santa Marta Mountains in
northern Colombia.
   El Tiempo quoted peasants there as saying the pro-Soviet
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces killed the eight for refusing
to cooperate with the rebels.
   The Santa Marta Mountains are on Colombia's Caribbean coast.
   Araujo said that last Sunday the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, attacked San Jeronimo, another town in Cesar state, and killed
four ranchers for refusing to pay what the guerrillas call a
revolution tax.
   The guerrillas also gathered townspeople in the town square and
exhorted them not to vote in the March 13 nationwide mayoral
elections.
   In the first two months of 1988 rebels kidnapped 14 mayors,
attacked a dozen towns, killed 31 soldiers, 28 police and 80 other
people, blew up oil pipelines and electricity cable towers and
attacked oil company drilling camps.
   Two of the mayors _ Luis Alberto Gonzalez of Pitalito and Anibal
Pena of San Agustin _ were freed in army attacks Friday on
guerrilla encampments near the southern town of San Agustin, the
Defense Ministry said.
   San Agustin is popular with foreign tourists because of the many
pre-Columbian statues in an archaeological park there.
   The mayors were kidnapped Feb. 25 by the National Liberation
Army, which freed 12 mayors previously after telling them to do
more for poor people in their districts.
   Political violence has been worst in southern Caqueta state,
where 40 local leaders of the governing Liberal Party were killed
in the last three months.
   Party leaders said the rebels were trying to terrorize it into
withdrawing from mayoral elections so the leftist Patriotic Union
party will win.
   Antonio Serrano Duarte, a congressman from the state, was shot
and wounded Tuesday night in Florencia, the state capital, national
police said in a communique. It said Serrano was out of danger in a
hospital.
   There are five leftist guerrilla groups in Colombia.
   Three members of the Patriotic Union Party were murdered in
Caqueta state in the last month. Right-wing death squads were
blamed for killing nearly 500 of the party's workers in the last
two years.

   It's not always the big names in the music
business who capture the coveted Grammy Award as Wednesday night's
announcement of first-time winners showed: actor Jack Nicholson,
veteran rocker Frank Zappa, ex-Righteous Brother Bill Medley and
the South African vocal group, Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
   ``First of all I thank God and then Paul Simon,'' said Joseph
Shabalala, Ladysmith's lead singer. The group performed on Simon's
breakthrough ``Graceland'' LP, and Simon produced the group's
``Shaka Zulu'' album which won for best traditional folk recording.
   Nicholson won his Grammy for best recording for children for his
narration of ``The Elephant's Child.'' The actor was not at Radio
City Music Hall to accept the award bestowed by the National
Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences.
   Joining him in the winner's circle for the first time was
Medley, who thanked God for his ``nine lives'' in the music
business.
   ``I've waited 26 years for this,'' said the bass singer after
winning best pop vocal performance by a duo or group for ``(I've
Had) The Time of My Life,'' a song he did with Jennifer Warnes.
   Zappa defeated his son, Dweezil, earning his first Grammy _ for
best rock instrumental performance _ after a career spanning more
than two decades. Bruce Springsteen was also a runner-up to Zappa
in the category.
   The awards, announced off-camera prior to the televised show,
also included a posthumous first-time Grammy for reggae star Peter
Tosh, who was murdered in his Jamaica home last year.
   ``It is so unfair that Peter Tosh is not here. He deserved this
very much,'' said his cousin Pauline Burgess, who accepted the
award.
   Professor Longhair, the New Orleans piano player, also won his
first Grammy with ``Houseparty New Orleans Style,'' which won as
best traditional blues recording.

   The union representing 6,700 Northwest
Airlines flight attendants instructed members Wednesday to begin a
slowdown by doing everything by the book.
   The attendants have remained on the job since a deadline for a
new contract passed Friday.
   ``Keep them busy, keep them guessing, keep them confused,'' Jeff
Musto, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 2747, said in a recorded
message on the union hotline.
   ``Remember you have to have all luggage stowed before you can
give permission to close the front boarding door. I think you get
the idea,'' he said.
   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said the airline operated
normally Wednesday. ``We have seen no evidence of any disruption or
attempt at disruption,'' he said.
   No talks are scheduled. The main stumbling block to a contract
is a company proposal to delay the promotion of lower-paid workers
to the higher bracket.
   Linda McMahon, operations manager for the five AAA Travel Agency
offices in Minneapolis, said she had not noticed any effect on
business or service from slowdown tactics.
   ``I haven't heard any specific complaints at this point. I was
certainly apprehensive when I heard about the `guerrilla warfare'
this morning. Everything seems to be going pretty much as usual,''
Ms. McMahon said.
   The threat of a strike has not deterred many travelers from
flying Northwest, she said.
   ``A lot of times there isn't comparable service on another
carrier. They will take their chances that Northwest will be
operating because they want to fly non-stop,'' Ms. McMahon said.
   Many business travelers are making alternate arrangements in
case of a strike, but vacationers who bought discount tickets in
advance have little recourse, she said.
   The unions representing the pilots and Machinists, who are
trying to negotiate separate contracts, have not said whether they
would honor flight attendants' picket lines.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House overwhelmingly passed a landmark
civil rights bill Wednesday that would broaden protections for
women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped, but President
Reagan has vowed to veto the measure.
   The Civil Rights Restoration Act, considered by many lawmakers
the most significant civil rights measure in 20 years, was sent to
the White House on a 315-98 vote. The Senate passed it by an
equally lopsided 75-14 vote in January.
   Both chambers passed the bill by the two-thirds margin needed to
override a presidential veto, but it was unclear whether the huge
margins would hold up following Reagan's vow Wednesday to reject
the measure.
   The restoration act was designed to reverse a 1984 Supreme Court
decision that narrowed the scope of four major civil rights laws
meant to prevent taxpayer financing of discrimination.
   Supporters of the act said hundreds of discrimination complaints
had been dropped or restricted since the decision.
   ``We have suffered far too long in waiting for this great and
important day,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
   In letters delivered Wednesday to several House Republicans,
Reagan said flatly he will veto the measure ``if it is presented to
me in its current form.''
   In the letters, sent from Brussels, Belgium, where Reagan is
attending a NATO summit, the president said the bill ``dramatically
expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state and local
governments and the private sector'' and ``poses a particular
threat to religious liberty.''
   In the case brought by Grove City (Pa.) College, the Supreme
Court held in a 6-3 opinion that Title IX _ a law barring sex
discrimination in federally funded education programs _ applies
only to specific programs or activities receiving federal
assistance and not the institutions of which they are part.
   The restoration act clarifies that entire institutions and
government agencies are covered if any program or activity within
them receives federal aid. The broad coverage also applies to the
private sector if the aid goes to a corporation as a whole or if
the recipient principally provides education, health care, housing,
social services or parks and recreation.
   The bill also says farmers getting crop subsidies, people on
food stamps and other individuals receiving federal assistance are
not required to comply with the anti-discrimination statutes.
   Sponsors of the restoration act said Congress always intended
broad civil rights protections on the theory that ``those who dip
their hands in the public till should not object if a little
democracy sticks to their fingers,'' as Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., put it.
   But opponents claim the bill goes far beyond restoration. Like
Reagan, they complained that it is too intrusive into the private
sector and religious organizations.
   ``The wording of the law is going to bring about unintended
consequences like you could never imagine,'' said Rep. George
Gekas, R-Pa.
   House leaders provoked controversy by bringing the Senate's
version of the civil rights bill directly to the floor Wednesday,
bypassing House committees and limiting amendments to one GOP
substitute for the entire bill.
   ``We need a Voting Rights Act for congressmen,'' sputtered Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   But other members said there had been more than 40 committee
hearings on the Grove City bill since 1984. Hawkins, chairman of
the House Education and Labor Committee and a senior member of the
Congressional Black Caucus, said 2,500 amendments had been offered
over the years.
   ``All the compromises that can possibly be made have already
been made. Certainly all the ideas that could ever have been
thought of have already been expressed,'' said Hawkins. ``The time
(to act) is now.''
   The GOP substitute, sponsored by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., would have limited the bill's impact on corporations and
allowed more educational institutions to escape compliance with the
sex discrimination ban on religious grounds.
   Sensenbrenner said he offered it in ``a spirit of
reconciliation'' to end the four-year congressional ordeal over the
bill. But it was defeated 266-146.
   An anti-abortion amendment adopted by the Senate says nothing in
the bill or in existing law requires institutions to perform or pay
for abortions. The amendment invalidates 1975 regulations that bar
discrimination against women who have had abortions or sought them
and require college health plans to treat abortions like other
temporary disabilities.
   Feminists considered the amendment a setback but did not
actively oppose the civil rights bill in the House. The National
Right-To-Life Committee called the amendment a great victory,
saying Wednesday that ``Congress has emphatically rejected the
legal doctrine that anti-abortion policies are a form of sex
discrimination.''
   The restoration act applies to the four civil rights laws
affected by the Supreme Court ruling: Title IX of the 1972
Education Amendments, barring sex discrimination in federally
funded education programs; the 1964 Civil Rights Act, barring
racial discrimination in federally-assisted programs; the 1973
Rehabilitation Act, barring discrimination against the handicapped
in any program or activity receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age
Discrimination Act, barring employment discrimination against older
people.
   The House passed the restoration act in similar form on a vote
of 375-32 in 1984, shortly after the court decision. The bill was
bottled up in a Senate committee until last year.

   NATO leaders on Wednesday demanded huge
cutbacks in Warsaw Pact tanks and artillery that ``cast a shadow''
over Europe, and endorsed President Reagan's efforts to negotiate
strategic arms reductions with the Soviet Union.
   Defining strategy for a new set of East-West negotiations, NATO
leaders said Soviet conventional forces pose the threat of a
surprise attack and must be slashed to rectify an imbalance in
military strength.
   The Soviet cutbacks would entail, for example, ``the elimination
from Europe of tens of thousands of Warsaw Pact weapons relevant to
surprise attack, among them tanks and artillery pieces,'' a NATO
communique said.
   Meeting behind closed doors at alliance's heavily guarded
headquarters, the leaders of the 16 alliance countries attempted to
accentuate agreement. They did not want to highlight differences
about the pace of modernizing short-range nuclear missiles left in
Europe after the elimination of longer-range weapons covered by a
new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty.
   British sources speaking on condition of anonymity said NATO
foreign ministers late Wednesday agreed on compromise language for
a final declaration Thursday on the modernization issue.
   The summit participants will call for the short-range nuclear
missiles to ``continue to be kept up-to-date where necessary,'' the
sources said, a statement that avoids the word ``modernization,''
to which West Germany objects.
   According to his spokesman, Reagan quoted Benjamin Franklin,
telling the NATO leaders, ``If we do not all hang together, we will
assuredly hang separately.''
   Security was so strict that a NATO guard attempted to eject a
reporter who asked Reagan a question as the leaders posed for a
``family photo.''
   Emphasizing alliance unity, Reagan said, ``There are no great
fundamental differences there. I have never seen such harmony and
togetherness as we have.''
   Reagan mixed NATO summitry with Middle East peace efforts. He
ordered Secretary of State George P. Shultz to make a whirlwind
return to the Middle East after the summit windup Thursday night to
continue his efforts to set up Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   First, Shultz will stop in London to see Jordan's King Hussein,
and on Friday will visit Israel, Egypt and Syria, returning to
Washington early Saturday morning.
   The NATO meeting is the alliance's first summit since 1982.
   Accompanied by their foreign ministers, the leaders gathered at
a long, walnut-brown oval table in a conference room shortly after
noon to hear an opening statement by Lord Carrington, NATO's
secretary general.
   For a minute or so, Carrington's remarks were obscured by a loud
hum on the translation earphones, causing foreign officials and
their aides to pull the earplugs out briefly and switch channels
for a clearer sound.
   Carrington said Reagan's effort to secure a 50 percent cut in
U.S. and Soviet long-range missiles ``has the alliance's full
support.''
   He spoke of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a man ``who is
ready to reduce some tensions'' but expressed concern about the
Kremlin's military might and ``the denial of basic human rights and
freedom to the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.''
   The leaders held nearly three hours of formal talks, in addition
to a luncheon and dinner, and issued a communique demanding that
the Soviet Union reduce its advantage in conventional, or
non-nuclear forces.
   The document highlights an issue of broad agreement within the
Western alliance _ directing the focus away from West Germany's
reluctance to move ahead with an alliance decision to modernize
short-range nuclear weapons.
   West Germany, which is most threatened by short-range weapons,
is pressing for talks with the Soviets to reduce the Kremlin's
large edge in those weapons.
   Most of the other NATO leaders _ including the United States and
Britain _ oppose such talks now, fearing they could lead to demands
for eliminating all of the weapons, leaving Europe exposed to the
Soviets' superior conventional forces.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said most of the leaders,
in their private remarks, touched on the issue of modernizing the
short-range weapons. ``Everybody has some feelings about that
issue, some more supportive than others.''
   A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke most directly on the
issue, but that even his remarks were muted.
   On the question of conventional forces, there is no dispute in
NATO that the Warsaw Pact has an advantage: about 3-to-1 in tanks
and artillery and nearly 2-to-1 in combat aircraft and troops,
including reserves in the Soviet Union. Moscow contends that
East-West conventional forces are roughly equivalent.
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, Reagan's national security adviser, said
the conventional arms negotiations ``will perhaps be more difficult
than any of the nuclear arms talks that have been held so far
because we're talking about large asymmetries, we're talking about
a large imbalance between our forces and those of the Warsaw Pact.''
   Reagan repeatedly denied there were any differences in the
talks, but Powell, in an interview with NBC-TV, suggested otherwise.
   He said that with 16 leaders, ``certainly there will be
differences and there will be heated debate and discussion from
time to time.'
   However, Powell said ``there was a sense of unity that was
overwhelming.
   ``And any minor dispute that might exist, or some of the debates
that are going on as to how one should characterize the
modernization issue (with short-range nuclear forces), pales in
comparison to the overall sense of unity that was conveyed at the
meeting today,'' he said.
   In a six-page statement on conventional forces, the NATO leaders
said:
   ``The Soviet Union's military presence in Europe, at a level far
in excess of its needs for self-defense, directly challenges our
security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation
in Europe.
   ``Thus, the conventional imbalance in Europe remains at the core
of Europe's security concerns.''
   The document sets the stage for negotiations to begin in earnest
this fall in Vienna, Austria, with representatives of the Warsaw
Pact consisting of the Soviet Union and six East European allies.
   ``Our aim will be to establish a situation in Europe in which
force postures as well as the numbers of deployments and weapons
systems no longer make surprise attack and large-scale offensive
action a feasible option,'' the NATO statement said.
   The new set of negotiations would replace 15 years of talks that
have failed to produce agreement. NATO wants the new talks to
encompass the full European area, from the Atlantic to the Ural
mountains, whereas the old talks were limited to the central front.

   The United States is taking legal action to
prevent Panama's military-dominated regime from withdrawing
Panamanian government funds from U.S. banks, a lawyer representing
opposition forces said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams raised
the possibility that the United States will withhold the next
payment due to Panama for tolls, fees and services for Panama Canal
operations.
   The two developments indicated Reagan administration interest in
accelerating a campaign of economic denial against the Panamanian
regime, dominated by the chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   William D. Rogers, a lawyer for ousted Panamanian President Eric
Arturo Delvalle, told a news conference about the alleged U.S.
effort to freeze Panamanian government funds deposited in American
banks.
   Although no firm figures were available, $50 million was said to
be involved.
   The State Department had no comment on the reported action, but
other officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the measures outlined by Rogers were being taken.
   Asked about the U.S. position on that issue, Abrams told the
Cable News Network, ``We know who the legitimate government of
Panama is. If the government of President Delvalle says to American
banks, don't pay money to Noriega, then all those banks are going
to come to the State Department and say, `Who's got the authority
here? Noriega or Delvalle?'
   ``We're going to answer that question. Delvalle is president of
Panama. And Noriega has been fired and he does not have legitimate
authority here.''
   Rogers, of the Arnold & Porter law firm, said the administration
action was being carried out to ensure that the banks may make
disbursements only to the Panamanian ambassador who served under
Delvalle, Juan B. Sosa. Delvalle was ousted last week after he
tried to fire Noriega and has been in hiding in Panama.
   Rogers said the State Department was issuing ``formal
certifications'' that it regards Sosa as ``the accredited
representative of the recognized government of the country.''
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said only
that such certifications were being prepared. She declined to
specify their purpose.
   At issue is the status of Panamanian government deposits at five
American banks. The attempt by Sosa and his allies to prevent the
transfer of these funds to the new Panamanian government is part of
an ambitious plan of economic warfare aimed at toppling Noriega.
   Delvalle was forced out last week after Noriega, under federal
indictment on drug smuggling charges, ignored Delvalle's attempt to
replace him.
   Rogers said the banks believed to have Panamanian government
deposits are Marine Midland NA, Irving Trust Co., Bankers Trust
Co., the Republic National Bank and the Bank of Boston.
   ``Every dime we can find is in those banks,'' Rogers said. He
added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for
whatever payments it makes to the current Panamanian government.
   Marine Midland and Irving Trust refused comment on the purported
State Department action. Another New York banking source, insisting
on anonymity, questioned the legitimacy of the effort to block
transfers of funds.
   Sosa said the State Department is seriously considering
withholding from Panama the next payment, due March 15, of the fees
the United States gives Panama for use of the Panama Canal. He
estimated that figure at $8 million, but other sources said it was
closer to $7 million.
   Mrs. Oakley confirmed that a request from the Delvalle
government to put the funds in escrow had been received and that
the State Department was consulting with other agencies on how to
proceed.
   Abrams indicated that no such request had been received but that
the United States would respond positively if asked.
   ``If they ask us to pay the canal payments into a different
account or delay it, I think we'd do that. We'd respond to
President Delvalle.
   ``If he tells us he doesn't want that money going to Noriega,
then we're not going to give it to Noriega.''
   Several members of the House Merchant Marine Committee, which
has jurisdiction over the Panama Canal, called on President Reagan
to withhold the payment and threatened to legislate that step if he
refuses to go along.
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., said, ``They (the Panamanian
authorities) are in dire need of funds. If this payment is denied
to them, the Noriega regime will have great difficulty maintaining
itself.''
   The legislators said nearly $80 million a year is paid to Panama
by the United States under terms of the Panama Canal treaties.
   In New York, lawyers for Delvalle sued in federal court to block
the Republic National Bank from turning over millions of dollars to
the new Panamanian government.
   The lawsuit was dropped after the bank agreed to transfer the
money, estimated at $10 million, to the Federal Reserve Bank for
safekeeping.
   In related matters Wednesday:
   _Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. said the CIA is conducting an
internal investigation into allegations that it was the source of
personal and political information on U.S. senators forwarded to
Noriega.
   The allegations of the CIA-Noriega link were first made at a
congressional hearing last month by Jose I. Blandon, a former top
Panamanian intelligence official. U.S. law prohibits the CIA from
engaging in domestic spying on American citizens.
   Two officials who identified themselves as being with the spy
agency's office of the inspector general interviewed Blandon last
week, D'Amato said.
   _ After meeting at the Capitol with Panamanian opposition
political leaders, D'Amato and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said they
will offer on the Senate floor on Thursday ``a progressive plan of
increased economic pressure'' against the Noriega regime.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of Panama's Christian
Democratic party, said the campaign to restore democracy will
prevail by combining ``peaceful people power'' in Panama,
international public opinion and ``the growing economic pressure
that is being exercised on the illegitimate regime of Gen.
Noriega.''
   _Financial experts in Miami said billions of dollars in bank
deposits have been taken out of Panama for safer havens in the wake
of Noriega's drug indictment in Miami last month.
   ``This certainly has destabilized Panama as a banking center,''
said Gonzalo Valdes-Fauli, senior vice president and manager of the
Miami office of London-based Barclay's Bank.
   One unidentified top banking expert told The Miami Herald that
from June to October, Panamanian banks lost $7 billion of the $36
billion they held. Panama in the 1980s had come to be known as the
Switzerland of Latin America, offering banking secrecy and
stability to the region's investors and depositors.
   Unlike other countries, Panama cannot cover its cash shortages
by printing new money becuase the dollar is the national currency.

   A 7-year-old born with no external eyes underwent
surgery Wednesday in another of a series of operations to create
eyelids and sockets and allow her to see.
   Dilek Erdogan of Turkey was born with a nose and a mouth, ``and
that's it for her face,'' said Dr. Allen Putterman, who performed
the surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital Eye and Ear
Infirmary. Her eyes are below the skin.
   Dilek's left eye, which will always be sightless, will be
replaced with an artifical one, but doctors hope to enable her see
out of her right eye, Putterman said.
   In August, Putterman slit the skin over her right eye and placed
a temporary insert between the skin and the eye to create some
space around the eyeball. He then sewed the slit closed.
   On Wednesday, he reopened the slit and began forming an eyelid.
Putterman said he also began the insertion procedure on the left
eye.
   Dilek was bought to this country for treatment more than a year
ago.

   Israeli troops fired tear
gas inside an Arab hospital Wednesday, forcing doctors to don gas
masks and sending dozens of choking patients fleeing with their
faces covered by Arab headdresses.
   Soldiers clubbed a Palestinian teen-ager suspected of throwing
rocks at troops from a barricade erected about 10 yards from the
hospital's emergency room.
   An Associated Press photographer saw soldiers throw the youth
head first down a flight of stairs, then sit on his stomach while
beating him with a wooden truncheon.
   Troops detained 20 Arabs suspected of participating in
demonstrations in Ramallah, Israel radio said.
   President Reagan, meanwhile, ordered Secretary of State George
P. Shultz to return to the Middle East on Thursday for further
talks with Arab and Israeli leaders.
   In Jerusalem, police detained 27 Israeli students from the
Bezalel art school after their parade for the Jewish holiday of
Purim turned into a protest against the Israeli handling of unrest
in the territories.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended Israel's policy of using
blows to subdue Arab protesters, saying that of several thousand
soldiers serving in the occupied territories, only 2 percent to 3
percent had commited excesses, the Itim news agency reported.
   As a matter of policy, the army does not release exact figures
on troop deployment.
   In Ramallah, eight miles north of Jerusalem, soldiers fired at
least six tear gas canisters at Palestinian protesters who used
rocks and twisted metal to block a street outside government-run
Ramallah Hospital and hurled stones at a dozen soldiers.
   One smoking canister landed in the emergency room reception area
and a second in a hospital courtyard.
   Two doctors donned gas masks and others held onions to their
noses to counter the effects of the gas. About 30 coughing
patients, including old men with canes, used Arab headdresses to
cover their faces.
   ``Even the doctors couldn't breathe, so imagine the effects on
the patients inside, many of whom are seriously ill,'' said one
doctor, who declined to identify himself.
   Soldiers detained three youths outside the hospital, dragging
away one of them with a gash on his forehead and a blood-drenched
shoulder.
   The tear gas attack was the second on the hospital in two days.
On Tuesday, three soldiers burst into the hospital, fired tear gas
and struck two doctors with their rifles as they searched for
demonstrators, the hospital director said.
   An army spokesman denied soldiers entered the hospital or beat
doctors in Tuesday's incident.
   Palestinian protesters have used hospitals, schools and sacred
mosques as hideouts to elude arrest and as staging grounds for
anti-Israeli riots, according to Israeli officials and eyewitnesses.
   Also in Ramallah Wednesday, police briefly detained three
Italian legislators who chained themselves to electric poles
outside a refugee camp and distributed anti-occupation leaflets,
Israel radio said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian organizers permitted merchants to
open their stores for three hours a day following a three-month
commercial strike, an Arab reporter said.
   But the army forced the stores to remain closed, saying
storekeepers were being intimidated, and the army would only permit
them to resume business when they did it of their own free will. In
the past, soldiers repeatedly tried to force stores to open to
break the strike.
   On the diplomatic front, right-wing legislators said Jordan's
King Hussein had gone back on previous understandings with Israel
by insisting the Palestine Liberation Organization be involved in
peace talks.
   ``King Hussein says the PLO must be involved in the peace
process and he wants a full-scale international conference,'' Likud
legislator Dan Meridor, a close aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, told Israel television. ``If that's progress, I don't know
what going backward is.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres agreed the PLO should not be
included in talks.
   Shamir himself on Wednesday accused Jordan of siding with ``the
most extreme elements in the Arab world'' and said the ultimate
goal of all Arab leaders was to destroy Israel.
   He spoke to members of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations.
   The Haaretz daily reported that, in order to prevent excesses by
soldiers, the army decided troops should not serve in the occupied
territories for more than 1{ months at a time.
   The newspaper said the army believed frustration and anger built
up during more than two months of serving in the territories had
caused four soldiers photographed by CBS News to beat two bound
Arabs with stones last week.
   Shamir said he was considering further restrictions on media
access in the occupied territories, saying journalists have harmed
Israel. He did not say what steps he might take. Soldiers now are
authorized to temporarily close parts of the occupied territories
to reporters.
   Shamir also called on American Jewish leaders to quell any
criticism of Israel within their ranks, saying it was ``non-Jewish
to join an anti-Israeli front of non-Jewish people.''

   Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole
implied Wednesday there was a connection between Vice President
George Bush's tenure as head of the Central Intelligence Agency and
speculation that Panamanian strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega was
on the CIA payroll. That drew a sharp response from Bush.
   Dole appeared with a dancing pineapple before a crowd of about
300 at a windy, rain-threatened rally in downtown New Orleans.
   At least twice Dole implied that Bush, who was head of the CIA
from 1976-77, might have had some dealings with Noriega.
   ``There's some evidence (Noriega) was on the CIA payroll as far
back as 1966. That's all I know,'' Dole said. He would not discuss
what the evidence was or what he knew.
   Bush, campaigning in Baton Rouge, La., criticized Dole for
bringing up the subject.
   ``I find it amazing that a United States senator will talk about
CIA matters. I took an oath of office to protect sources and
methods of intelligence and I would never discuss anything I was
doing at the CIA that would affect the national security,'' Bush
said.
   ``There has been one charge after another in this campaign and I
have just decided not to respond to Mr. Dole's charges.''
   However, Bush pointed to Noriega's recent indictment on federal
drug charges.
   ``I would point out that it's the Reagan-Bush administration
under which Mr. Noriega is being indicted in Florida for drugs.''
   Dole has grown increasingly critical of Bush in the final days
before the Super Tuesday round of caucuses and primaries in which
the vice president has a comfortable lead.
   ``I need to convince a lot of people in the next few days
there's only one candidate tough enough to do the job, and that
candidate's Bob Dole,'' Dole said.
   Dole said if elected he would force his desire for a line-item
veto into the courts.
   ``When the appropriations bill comes down, I'd line-item veto a
few things ... and send it back to Congress. Then we'd have a
constitutional question,'' Dole said, which would throw the issue
into the courts.
   If Congress won't approve a balanced budget amendment, Dole said
he would go to the American people and call a constitutional
convention to get one.
   Dole also pledged to support American interests in the Panama
Canal Zone after the year 2000, when the United States is supposed
to turn over control of the canal to the central American country.
   ``I sure am glad I voted against the Panama Canal treaty. That
vote looks better every day,'' he said.

   Two big obstacles in the war on drugs are
low-level bureaucrats who don't have their hearts in the effort and
an overbearing Congress, two top administration officials contended
Wednesday
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, one of four Cabinet officials
appearing on a nine-member administration panel at the White House
Conference on a Drug-Free America, asserted there is no problem of
leadership at the top.
   He called for more state and local financial assistance, less
congressional meddling and more determination by federal employees
to get with the programs outlined by their superiors.
   Responding to written questions submitted by some of the
estimated 2,000 people attending the conference, Meese said there
is no need for a federal drug czar to coordinate the battle.
   ``I thik this idea has been so discredited there is nobody that
really believes in that any more,'' he said. ``What has happened is
there is a drug czar in the United States, and that is the
president of the United States.''
   Meese acknowledged that with several different agencies involved
``you're going to have differences of opinion,'' but he said there
are mechanisms for resolving interagency disputes and that he is
``not worried about the organizational aspects.''
   However, he continued: ``I am extremely concerned about the
fragmentation that goes on in Congress, the fact that we have 32
different committees in the Congress with cognizance over the drug
problem so that too many of the leaders who are seated on the stage
here are spending their time testifying in front of congressional
committees instead of leading the forces that ought to be out in
the field working on the drug problem.''
   William von Raab, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, said
too many bureaucrats lack enthusiasm for fighting the drug war.
   ``I have been flat out told by many bureaucrats that just
because the president is supporting an effort it doesn't mean that
money goes with it,'' he said. ``We don't need a bunch of
bureaucrats that will deal with this war on drugs the way they
dealt with the war in Vietnam. We need heart in this effort ....''
   ``There are still too many people who work for us _ in my
organization as well _ who still have their noses too deeply buried
in their old books,'' the Customs chief said. ``These are the
conscientious objectors, the shirkers and the fourth columnists in
this war.''
   Meese associated himself with those remarks, but neither he nor
von Raab identified the people they were talking about.
   Responding to another question, Meese discounted any implication
that he does not favor continued federal financing for federal drug
treatment programs. But he said state and local officials need to
do more.
   Von Raab said that starting March 15, the Customs Service will
begin taking the passports of Americans who try to re-enter the
country with drugs. The passports are to be seized as evidence of a
crime and forwarded to the State Department, said Customs Service
spokesman Edward Kittredge.
   Among the other administration participants at the
congressionally ordered conference was Education Secretary William
Bennett, who embraced the long-simmering idea of making more use of
U.S. military forces to interdict the flow of drugs into the United
States.
   ``As the greatest military and economic power in the world, we
can do more to prevent criminals in foreign nations from growing or
processing illegal drugs,'' Bennett said.
   ``It is to be hoped we can do this in collaboration with foreign
governments, but if need be we must consider doing this by
ourselves,'' he said. ``And we should consider broader use of
military force against both the production and shipment of drugs.''
   Congress has considered legislation since 1983 to authorize
military intervention against drug shipments. The measure has
passed the House in one form or another on three occasions, but has
never passed the Senate.
   The latest congressional action on the issue called for the
General Accounting Office to study the impact on military readiness
of having the Defense Department play a lead role in the anti-drug
effort.
   During Wednesday's session, New York Mayor Edward I. Koch was
rebuffed when he attempted to ask a question about the role of the
military in the drug war from the floor rather than submit it in
writing as others were required to do.
   ``What I saw was a lot of back-scratching,'' Koch said later of
the preceedings. ``It is incredible ... that they would stifle
debate and not allow questions from the floor. It is a disservice
to the mission.''
   But Koch, who said he was speaking for the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, told reporters he liked what he heard from Bennett and von
Raab _ especially the idea of using military forces against foreign
drug dealers.
   ``We'll take care of the communists later,'' he said. ``They're
not now seeking to invade the United States. It's the drug
dealers.''

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
fulfilled a boyhood ambition Wednesday as he detoured from the
beaten political campaign trail to make a pilgrimage to the Boston
Red Sox spring training camp.
   He didn't forget politics, also making a speech at a Florida
high school, celebrating his victory in Tuesday's non-binding
Vermont primary and crowing in Miami that ``we must be coming on
strong folks'' when told that Republican candidate George Bush had
criticized him in another Southern state.
   Bush, in Mississippi, said Dukakis wanted to reduce the number
of Navy battleships, which Bush called a ``dumb idea.''
   ``We'll have a strong, well-equipped Navy, but we're not going
to spend $36 billion on two super carrier task forces,'' Dukakis
said.
   The Massachusetts governor began airing a new television
commercial attacking Rep. Richard Gephardt and mocking Gephardt's
populist slogan, ``It's your fight too.''
   The advertisement says Gephardt is taking campaign contributions
from ``big establishment power brokers'' and adds: ``Kinda makes
you wonder, is Dick Gephardt fighting your fight or theirs?''
   In Winter Haven, unlike ordinary tourists, the governor even got
a turn in the big league batting cage, although he had little to
show for it.
   The one-time freshman catcher on the Brookline, Mass., High
School squad donned Red Sox jersey No. 1 and took 10 swings against
a batting practice pitcher. He fouled off three balls, popped one
into the batting cage, hit five grounders and whiffed once.
   ``I want you to work on your swing,'' advised outfielder Dwight
Evans.
   ``At least I made contact,'' said the 54-year-old governor. He
acknowledged to reporters, ``I'm a little rusty, as you can see.''
   The self-described ``long-suffering'' Red Sox fan said, ``It's a
great thrill to be here. I've never been to spring training. It's
something all Boston kids want to do.''
   ``I'm very optimistic about the campaign and the Red Sox,'' he
said. ``If we could both win our World Series, that would be a
(great) 1988.''
   Dukakis is doing well in many polls heading into Tuesday's round
of 20 primaries and caucuses, primarily in the South, but he said
the Red Sox, like himself, should ``just keep working and don't pay
any attention to the polls.''
   Outside a high school in Apopka, Fla., Dukakis said, ``We're
going to do well across the South'' with a campaign emphasizing
``jobs, good health care, the environment _ things that people care
about in the South and all over the country.''
   Referring to rival Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee senator who
has geared his campaign to the South, Dukakis said, ``If you put
all of your eggs in one regional basket ... it becomes a lot more
crucial that you do exceedingly well.''
   He got an enthusiastic welcome at an assembly of Apopka High
School's 460-member senior class, but there were a few groans when
Dukakis defended his stands against aid to the Contras and the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   When Dukakis asked, ``Is it going to be Star Wars or housing for
the homeless, is it going to be MX missiles or housing for the
homeless?'' some of the teen-agers replied, ``Star Wars, MX
missiles.''
   Nearly one-fifth of Apopka's students are in a Marine ROTC
program and several seniors wore their dress blues.
   Dukakis also got a campaign boost in the Super Tuesday state of
Hawaii, where Gov. John Waihee has thrown the support of the
state's Democratic Party leadership behind him.
   Waihee had maintained an uncommitted stance until now.
   ``I think the game is on the line Tuesday. We can stand on the
sidelines and watch, or we can get into the game,'' Waihee told a
news conference Wednesday in Honolulu.
   The announcement came with Dukakis listening in from Miami,
Fla., on a telephone conference call.
   ``I'm sitting here glowing,'' Dukakis said. He called Waihee ``a
man who has shown great wisdom in his choice of presidential
candidates.''
   Waihee said the Dukakis endorsement has the backing of Hawaii's
Sens. Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga and Rep. Daniel Akaka, Lt.
Gov. Ben Cayetano and other Democratic leaders.
   Hawaii's Super Tuesday precinct elections will include a
presidential preference vote that will be binding on at least 20 of
Hawaii's 28 delegates to the Democratic Party National Convention.
   Before the Dukakis endorsement, party leaders said they had
expected Jesse Jackson to gain a plurality in Hawaii's precinct
elections, with Dukakis and ``uncommitted'' splitting most of the
balance.

   A senator complained Wednesday that Gov.
Evan Mecham sent an ``inappropriate'' letter proclaiming his
innocence to every member of the Arizona Senate, which is sitting
as judge and jury at his impeachment trial.
   An irate Sen. Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera arose at the close of the
third day of the first-term Republican's impeachment trial and held
up the letter.
   ``I hope Governor Mecham understands the oath we have taken,''
said Higuera, urging other senators not to read the document. ``I
hope Mr. Mecham would understand it's inappropriate to try to
communicate with us.''
   The five-page document was a copy of Mecham's statement from a
Saturday news conference during which the governor pleaded his case
and claimed it was unfair to try him on impeachment charges before
a criminal case can be resolved.
   A cover memo on the governor's official stationery accompanied
each copy.
   Mecham, 63, was impeached by the House on charges of concealing
a $350,000 campaign loan, borrowing $80,000 in state funds for his
auto dealership and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged
death threat against a former aide.
   He also also faces a March 22 trial March on charges of
concealing the loan and a May 17 recall election.
   One of Mecham's lawyers, Tom Crowe, told The Associated Press he
considered the governor's sending the letter appropriate.
   ``It's a political proceeding,'' said Crowe. ``The senators have
received communications from many people pro and con. I don't see
why the governor should be any different.''
   Some senators who had voted to delay the impeachment trial said
they had received notes from Mecham thanking them for their support.
   In recent weeks, senators have asked that Mecham stop making
phone calls to their offices during the impeachment proceedings.
They said they consider the calls inappropriate and did not talk
the governor, who is suspended from office.
   On Tuesday, a flap arose when it appeared that Mecham had tried
to contact a witness, but the governor later said the phone call
was placed by mistake.
   During testimony earlier in the day, an attorney for Mecham
suggested that the alleged death threat to a grand jury witness was
``a political matter,'' not a crime.
   Mecham's former security chief, testifying for a second day,
said he considered the incident a potential felony and told Mecham
a crime could be involved.
   ``The criminal nature of it was primary in my mind,'' said
Department of Public Safety Lt. Charles ``Beau'' Johnson. ``I did
not really think of it in the political sense.''
   ``Didn't you also believe this could be a political matter?''
defense attorney Fred Craft asked.
   ``I don't recall that that crossed my mind,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson and another former member of the governor's security
detail have testified they were told that Mecham's aide, Lee
Watkins, threatened in November that the governor's former
legislative liaison, Donna Carlson, might ``go on a long boat
ride'' if she didn't stop testifying before a grand jury
investigating Mecham.
   Mecham is accused of instructing the head of the DPS not to
cooperate in the attorney general's probe. Watkins has denied
threatening Ms. Carlson, and he has not been charged.
   Mecham, who stayed away from the trial for a third day, has said
he didn't know all the details of the incident, contended that he
didn't know a potential felony was involved and blamed his security
officers for not fully informing him.
   ``I told him it was a felony to tamper with a witness,'' Johnson
said. ``I didn't say the words `death threat.' But I said
`tampering with a witness.' I have no doubts about that ... I was
not hiding anything from the governor.''
   He also said he thought the matter was ``being taken too
lightly'' by the governor and his staff.
   ``When you took it to Fred Craft did he take it seriously?''
Craft asked, referring to himself. Craft was formerly Mecham's
lobbyist in Washington.
   ``Yes,'' said Johnson. ``But I think the focus of your concern
was embarrassment to the governor.''
   Craft's participation as defense attorney as well as a principal
in the disputed events raised protests from some senators.
   Republican Majority Leader Robert Usdane accused Craft of
misleading senators about his role when they agreed to let him join
the defense. His participation as a lawyer bars him from being
called by either side as a witness, although some senators believe
they could call Craft to testify.
   Earlier, the trial's presiding officer, Arizona Chief Justice
Frank X. Gordon, said he would not allow the defense to introduce
an affidavit intended to discredit a key witness by alleging he had
an affair with an employee in 1982.
   The prospective witness, DPS Director Ralph Milstead, has said
the allegations are ``ridiculous.''
   ``I don't think it's necessary to go into old past history about
someone's past sexual liaison, and he denies it,'' said Gordon.
``It has no value to prove anything material to these issues.''
   A two-thirds vote of the Senate would be required to convict
Mecham on any count and remove him from office. The Senate could,
by another two-thirds vote, then bar Mecham from holding any state
office again.

   An opposition leader said Wednesday
that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was purging his army of suspected
opponents, and doctors joined businesses in a general strike aimed
at ousting the military strongman.
   Guillermo Cochez, a national legislator and vice president of
the opposition Christian Democratic Party, told reporters that
Noriega apparently had fired two senior colonels and two majors
suspected of being disloyal.
   Cochez said they included Col. Marcos Justines, who as chief of
staff was No. 2 in the Panamanian Defense Forces and next in line
to succeed Noriega.
   For a second day, the strike was marked by violence in a
middle-class neighborhood near the banking district. On Tuesday,
security agents destroyed an opposition radio station in the
neighborhood, apparently because it broadcast an appeal for
anti-Noriega demonstrations.
   Demonstrators gathered Wednesday along the four-lane street in
front of the station, set up barricades of burning trash, and set
fire to a minivan and a car.
   Anti-riot police chased the protesters into side streets and
apartment buildings. Chunks of concrete were hurled down at police
from at least two of the apartment houses.
   Police fired tear-gas grenades and pumped tear gas into the
buildings from portable tanks, filling the entire neighborhood with
the acrid, stinging fumes.
   The officer in charge stood in the middle of the street and
shouted to residents, ``You'll come out like cockroaches!''
   None did, and reporters on the scene saw no one injured.
   A spokesman for the Panama Canal Commission said anonymous
telephone callers warned Tuesday and Wednesday that a bomb was
planted in commission headquarters.
   Spokesman Franklin Castrellon told The Associated Press the
building was evacuated and searched both days but no bombs were
found.
   In Washington, meanwhile, William D. Rogers, a lawyer for a
Panamanian opposition group, said the State Department was taking
legal action to keep Noriega's regime from withdrawing Panamanian
government funds from U.S. banks. About $50 million was said to be
involved.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams raised the
possibility that the United States will withhold the next payment
due to Panama for tolls, fees and services for Panama Canal
operations.
   Abrams also told the Cable News Network that ``if the government
of President (Eric Arturo) Delvalle says to American banks, don't
pay money to Noriega, then all those banks are going to come to the
State Department and say, `Who's got the authority here? Noriega or
Delvalle?'
   ``We're going to answer that question ... Noriega has been fired
and he does not have legitimate authority there,'' Abrams said.
   Cochez said he could not ``absolutely confirm'' the firings, but
several diplomatic sources said they also had heard the reports and
tended to believe them.
   Justines was chosen by President Devalle on Feb. 25 to replace
Noriega, but Devalle's attempt to fire Noriega backfired. Noriega
supporters in the National Assembly instead voted to oust Delvalle.
   Justines then joined other ranking officers in pledging their
loyalty to Noriega, who is under indictment in the United States on
drug trafficking charges.
   Cochez said Col. Elias Castillo, the army chief and the No. 4
man in the military hierarchy, also was fired, along with two
majors, Moises del Rio and Fernando Quesada.
   ``I think the purge is good for the democratic process because
it will show the other officers that he (Noriega) is not interested
in the institution, but only in himself,'' Cochez said. ``Most
officers are supporting Noriega because they consider it an
institutional problem.''
   The armed forces press office said it could not confirm the
reported removals of officers.
   Noriega has headed the 15,000-member Defense Forces, which
includes the army, navy, air force and police, since 1983. He was
seen as the real power behind Delvalle's civilian government.
   Most of the capital's doctors appeared to have joined the
nationwide strike against Noriega, which began Monday.
   AP reporters visited four hospitals and clinics around the
capital Wednesday and found them taking new patients only on an
emergency basis.
   The government, which through official media has been calling
the strike ``a complete failure,'' tacitly admitted health care
problems. The Health Ministry issued a communique calling on all
unemployed physicians to report to ministry offices for assignment.
   Calls to areas outside the capital indicated mixed participation
in the strike.
   In Colon, the country's other major commercial center, Daniel
Delgado of the Chamber of Commerce said economic activity had
proceeded almost normally Monday and Tuesday. But he said the
chamber called on members to join the strike for 48 hours beginning
Thursday.
   In Chiriquii province, on the Costa Rican border, the Chamber of
Commerce reported a significant reduction in activity, with
virtually all branches of capital-based stores and businesses shut
down.
   In Chitre, 90 miles southwest of Panama City, Horacio Rodriguez,
director of the Association of Executives, said about 60 percent of
the city's economic activity was shut down.
   The National Civic Crusade, an alliance of about 200 business,
labor, professional and political groups, claimed Tuesday night
that the strike had succeeded in shutting down 85 percent of the
country's economic acivity.

   President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday
proposed holding the third round of Nicaraguan cease-fire talks
without the country's Roman Catholic leader, saying the mediator
had failed to produce results.
   Ortega said the talks, scheduled for next week, should be held
in the Nicaraguan town of Sapoa, near the Costa Rican border. It
was the first time the leftist Sandinista government has agreed to
talk to the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo has been mediating the talks on
ending the 7-year-old war.
   Ortega said his government decided ``to take the bull by the
horns'' because Obando y Bravo's mediation had not produced any
results.
   ``The cardinal himself had suggested some time ago that a direct
meeting, and in our country, would be very important,'' Ortega said.
   ``I told him that today I have decided to name the member of the
National Directorate of the Sandinista Liberation Front and defense
minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega, as the chief of the (Sandinista)
delegation,'' he added. The defense minister is the president's
brother.
   The Contra rebels sent a message to the cardinal earlier
Wednesday, agreeing to his proposal to hold new talks on March
10-11.
   The last round of negotiations broke off Feb. 19 in Guatemala
after the cardinal said the two sides had reached an impasse.
   After making his proposal, President Ortega said: ``In this
manner, we are testing whether there really exists the will to work
for peace on the part of the so-called directorate of the
counter-revolution, since it can no longer give any excuses.''
   He referred to the directorate of the Contra umbrella
organization known as the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   Ortega spoke with reporters shortly after meeting with Obando y
Bravo in the evening, but there was no immediate comment from the
cardinal.
   The Sandinistas previously refused to hold the talks in
Nicaragua, saying the rebels should seek a government amnesty
before being able to enter the country.
   Obando y Bravo sent a letter to Ortega earlier Wednesday
hammering at the need to resume cease-fire negotiations.
   During the February talks, the cardinal increased his role by
proposing a peace agenda. Besides calling for a laying down of
arms, he asked the Sandinistas to grant total political amnesty,
restore full press freedoms, revise the military draft law and
reopen talks with the opposition political parties that remain
active inside Nicaragua.
   He also suggested the Contras be permitted to enter designated
cease-fire zones with their arms for a one-month truce.
   In their message Wednesday accepting the new round of talks, the
Contras reiterated their acceptance of the agenda proposed by the
cardinal, said Jorge Rosales, a spokesman in Miami for the rebel
coalition, known as the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   The Sandinistas maintain they will not discuss political issues
with the Contras. They say amnesty will be granted after a
cease-fire agreement is reached.
   Talks with the internal political parties broke off in December
when opposition members insisted on constitutional changes.
   The cease-fire and internal dialogue are outlined in a regional
peace plan signed last August by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras.
   The Sandinistas want talks with the Contras to center on the
mechanics of how and where the rebels should lay down their arms.
   The government asked Obando y Bravo last November to mediate the
talks. The church backed the successful Sandinista struggle to
overthrow the right-wing, pro-American Somoza dynasty in 1979, but
later became a firm critic of the Sandinista government.
   The cardinal acted as go-between until January, when the
Sandinistas softened their position and agreed to hold direct talks
with the rebels.
   In other developments, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday that
its intelligence sources reported increased U.S. military activity
in Central America and American troop movement along its borders.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, said no
American troops were near the border with Nicaragua. The spokesman
added, however, that engineering-training projects _ carried out
annually in the dry season _ had temporarily increased the number
of flights out of Palmerola air base and the number of troops in
Honduras.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The ministry communique said ammunition and explosives were
transferred recently from U.S. military installations in Panama to
Costa Rica, Nicaragua's neighbor to the south.
   The communique said 1,000 U.S. Army troops, including some from
the 82nd Airborne Division, were moved to the Nicaragua's
northeastern border with Honduras. It said Special Forces units
were moved to the northwestern border.
   ``There've been no border troop movements,'' the embassy
spokesman said.
   U.S. troops that participate in combined Honduran-U.S. exercises
are prohibited by U.S. law from going within 20 miles of the border
with Nicaragua.

   Winners at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards waxed
poetic, gushed, cried, giggled and gave thanks to the music
industry, their record companies, friends, family and God as they
accepted their prizes Wednesday night.
   ``I can't tell you how I feel,'' said a bubbly Whitney Houston
backstage at Radio City Music Hall after winning best female pop
vocalist for her single, ``I Wanna Dance With Somebody'' from her
second LP, ``Whitney.''
   ``It's just so emotional. ... I'm nervous, very proud, very
honored, excited; it's very great,'' said Houston, who was a Grammy
winner two years ago for her platinum debut album.
   Jody Watley, who was named best new artist, thanked ``everybody
at MCA, my manager, I thank God, my producers ... my video director
... my publicist ... my attorney.''
   Veteran rhythm and blues performer Little Richard, who helped
define rock 'n' roll more than three decades ago, stole the show by
declaring himself the winner before opening the envelop to reveal
Watley's name.
   ``Y'all never gave me no Grammys and I've been singing for
years,'' he shouted, strutting about the stage for an amused
audience. ``I'm the architect of rock 'n' roll. ... Being a brown
Jew from Georgia, I had to tell the truth.''
   Little Richard, who dropped out of the rock life years ago to
become an evangelist, announced two years ago that he had converted
to Judaism.
   Bono, lead singer of the Irish rockers U2, whose politically
introspective LP, ``The Joshua Tree,'' won two Grammys including
album of the year, said: ``We set out to make music _ soul music.
... That's not about being black or white. ... It's a decision to
reveal or conceal.''
   George Michael, on tour in Australia to promote his hit LP
``Faith,'' was thrilled that he had won a Grammy in the rhythm and
blues category for his duo with soul queen Aretha Franklin.
   ``Winning the R & B category with Aretha validates the
tremendous influence R & B music has had on my music, songwriting
and creative process,'' Michael said through his spokesman, Phil
Lobel. ``Not bad for a Brit with soul.''
   One of the best acceptances at the awards show came from pianist
Vladimir Horowitz who walked off the stage with a twinkle and no
comment after being handed the prize for best classical album for
his ``Horowitz in Moscow.''
   Earlier, the esteemed artist thanked the National Academy of
Recording Arts & Sciences for President's Special Merit Award: ``I
am so very happy that classical music still has an appreciation.''
   Ray Benson, leader of ``Asleep at the Wheel,'' a five-man band
that plays Western swing, said: ``It feels great. It feels amazing.
It's like you've been down 10 to nothing in the 9th inning and
winning.''
   The band won for best country instrumental performance for the
song ``String of Pars,'' which Benson said was for golfers. The
band last won 10 years ago in the same category for ``1 O'clock
Jump,'' a Count Basie song in Western style.
   He said it's sometimes difficult keeping a band together.
``Everyday, if you're asleep at the wheel, you're in danger of a
lot of things.''
   Suzanne Vega, who was nominated for three Grammys for her
touching song about an abused child, ``Luka,'' talked backstage at
Radio City Music Hall after learning she had lost the trophy for
best female pop vocalist and song of the year. She also was
nominated for record of the year, but didn't win.
   ``I was hoping it would win, but I was prepared for anything to
happen,'' she said. ``I'm a little disappointed I guess.''
   Cynthia Weil, who with Barry Mann won song of the year for
writing the sweet ballad, ``Somewhere Out There,'' said: ``We wrote
it for the mice. We didn't even think about a pop record when we
wrote it.''
   The song was written for the animated movie, ``An American
Tail,'' the story of an immigrant mouse family. It was recorded as
a duet by Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram, who were nominated as
best pop performance by a duo or group. When asked if winning the
Grammy made up for losing an Academy Award last year for best song,
Weil said, ``It does. It's nice to win an award that comes from the
music industry _ that's our home.''
   Weil and Mann are the last songwriting team creating from the
legendary Brill Building in New York, once a haven for American
song.
   Said Narada Michael Walden, who won the producer award for the
LP, ``Whitney'': ``I think the world wants new faces in a way. ...
Whitney is an angel and it's purity, like this flower.'' He was
carrying a red rose.
   ``I felt this was a very special year. My competition is my
friends. Quincy (Jones, who co-produced the Michael Jackson LP,
``Bad'') I love. U2 I admire very much. I think we are all great
music lovers. I think we bring the spirit down. We are all
brothers.''

   Israeli troops fired tear
gas inside an Arab hospital Wednesday, forcing doctors to don gas
masks and sending dozens of choking patients fleeing with their
faces covered by Arab headdresses.
   Soldiers clubbed a Palestinian teen-ager suspected of throwing
rocks at troops from a barricade erected about 10 yards from the
hospital's emergency room.
   An Associated Press photographer saw soldiers throw the youth
head first down a flight of stairs, then sit on his stomach while
beating him with a wooden truncheon.

   President Reagan, vowing to ``spare no effort''
in the pursuit of peace, ordered Secretary of State George P.
Shultz on Wednesday to return to the Middle East for more talks
with Arab and Israeli leaders.
   Reagan made the decision to re-commit U.S. prestige to an effort
that so far has not produced visible results after Shultz reported
on four days of diplomatic shuttling and a session Tuesday in
London with King Hussein of Jordan.
   ``It is clear all countries in the region believe it is useful
for the United States to remain engaged in this process,'' Reagan
said. `We will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive
peace settlement.''

   Prodded by the Food and Drug

any advertising that claims aspirin can help prevent a first heart
attack, despite a report in a medical journal that drew this
conclusion.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young announced the agreement after he
met for more than an hour with company representatives who came to
his office in this Washington suburb after he sent a letter
reminding of the FDA's power to regulate.
   At a news conference, Young said he had told the manufacturers
that if they promoted their products for a use not supported by an
FDA analysis, they could be guilty of mislabeling, and ``this
mislabeling can lead to regulatory action by the FDA.''

   A study of Massachusetts women who gave birth
found that one in 500 was infected with the AIDS virus, and
researchers projecting their findings nationwide say several
thousand AIDS-infected babies could be born in the United States
each year.
   Most surveys of AIDS infection have concentrated on male
homosexuals, drug addicts and others at high risk of catching the
disease. Estimating the prevalence of the virus in the general
population has been difficult.
   ``This paper gives a more accurate way to judge the scope of the
epidemic in women,'' said Dr. Rodney Hoff. ``Nothing else comes
close to this in being able to measure the prevalence in the United

   Pat Robertson wants to drop his libel suit
against a former congressman who questioned his war record because
going to trial now would ``sacrifice his presidential campaign,''
his lawyer said Wednesday. But Robertson's accuser declared, ``He's
chickening out of the trial just like he chickened out 37 years

   Former Rep. Paul McCloskey, R-Calif., who has accused Robertson
of using his father's political influence to avoid combat duty in
the Korean War, has said in recent weeks he wouldn't settle the
suit unless Robertson paid the costs, which McCloskey estimates at
$400,000, of defending against the suit.
   The trial, set to begin on Tuesday, when Robertson hopes to do
well in delegate-rich Southern primaries, would force him off the
campaign trail for three weeks, attorney Douglas Rigler said.

   New home sales fell 9 percent in January,
pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the
last recession, the government said Wednesday as the housing
industry continued to stagger following the October stock market
collapse.
   A downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset
of a recession, but analysts said they believed falling mortgage
rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months.
   In January, the Commerce Department said that sales of new
single-family homes fell for the third consecutive month, dropping
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units, 26 percent
below a year ago and the slowest pace since the last recession was
ending in December 1982.

   Once again good news has intruded on the gilded
dreams of gold investors, whose hopes for wealth depend on fears of
inflation or economic collapse.
   The price of gold has fallen from $500 an ounce in mid-December
to $430 an ounce this week, making it a particularly bad investment
so far in 1988.
   What went wrong is that too many things went right in the
aftermath of October's stock market collapse.
   Jeffrey A. Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors Inc., ticks some of them off:
   ``Low inflation, a stronger dollar, stable world equity markets,
a stronger U.S. bond market, rising confidence in the economic
outlooks around the world, and, very significantly in the last
couple of weeks, rising confidence in the Federal Reserve and
Chairman (Alan) Greenspan.''
   Good news for the general public, but bad news for gold bugs.
   So with good times breaking out, why is Nichols still predicting
that gold will reach $500 an ounce again within the next 12 months,
and go ``perhaps significantly higher''?
   An excess of supply that marked the first few months of 1988 is
likely to end, Nichols argues.
   He says the Soviet Union probably will sell less gold from now
on because it has raised a large portion of the foreign currency
reserves it will need for the year.
   Mining companies will ease up on the downward pressure they put
on gold prices through their sales of gold for future delivery in
forward contracts, Nichols says.
   And the spate of ``gold loans'' is likely to ease up somewhat,
Nichols said. Newmont Mining Corp. dumped 1 million ounces of gold
onto the market this year when it borrowed against future
production and then sold the gold to raise cash and pay off debts
acquired in a successful takeover defense.
   Although an additional 2 million ounces' worth of gold loans are
already in the pipeline, Nichols said, the flood should diminish
after that.
   On the demand side, investors in Japan and elsewhere in the Far
East have taken a new interest in gold. The Japanese imported 40
tons of gold in February alone, Nichols estimates. The appetite for
kilobars _ 31 ounces of pure gold _ is so great in the Far East
that he says fabricators cannot keep up.
   Indians imported 100 tons of gold last year even though it is
illegal to bring gold into India because of foreign-exchange
controls, Nichols said, declining to divulge where he got the
information.
   New gold coins from the American Eagle and Canadian Maple Leaf
to the Chinese Panda are increasing investors' and collectors'
interest in gold, while various banks and investment houses have
created accumulation plans that allow people to buy gold on
schedule.
   And there is always the chance of more bad news _ which, of
course, is good news.
   Trouble in South Africa tends to push up gold prices by
threatening to cut off supplies at the source.
   And any hint that the next president will be fiscally
irresponsible would do wonders for gold.
   ``Even Republicans can be fiscally stimulative, as we've seen
from Ronald Reagan. But generally Democrats have a reputation for
not being fiscally conservative,'' said John Norris, a Citibank
vice president in charge of precious metals.
   ``If somebody like Jesse Jackson ever had a chance of being
elected, I think you'd see gold really start to move up,'' Norris
said.

<HEAD>Romanticized Form of Larceny is On the Rise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1964 film, ``Topkapi,'' Peter Ustinov and
Melina Mercouri played thieves who descended into a museum in
Istanbul through a skylight to steal a jewel-encrusted dagger.
   That plot was repeated with stunning accuracy last month when
burglars broke into Manhattan's Colnaghi Art Gallery through a
skylight, shinnied down a rope and plucked 27 Old Master paintings
and drawings off the walls.
   The stolen artwork was valued at $6 million, making it the
biggest art heist in New York history. The most valuable pieces
stolen were two panels by the 15th century Italian Renaissance
master Fra Angelico worth $4 million.
   But unlike the cunning thieves in ``Topkapi,'' those who broke
into the Colnaghi Gallery on Feb. 8 appear to have been unschooled
burglars who had no clear idea of what they were stealing.
   If so, their fate is ironic: their booty may be impossible to
sell at anything resembling its face value.
   Art theft, long romanticized as a genteel form of larceny, is on
the rise. Some law enforcement officials and other experts believe
it may rank second only to narcotics trafficking in value of
ill-gotten gains.
   ``If you're talking about dollar value, it probably is,'' said
one Justice Department official who specializes in crime
statistics. He stressed that he was only speculating since art
theft is not recognized as a separate category in federal
statistics. He declined to give his name.
   ``It began to increase in the late '50s and the early '60s when
the art market began to rise,'' said Milton Esterow, editor and
publisher of ArtNews magazine. ``More and more thieves began to
wake up and say, `Hey! There's a lot of money here!'''
   If there was a lot of money then, there's more now.
   Masterworks often cost many times the value of the mansions
where they're hung. Vincent Van Gogh's painting, ``Irises,'' set a
record last November when it was sold for $53.9 million.
   Art thieves usually fall into one of three categories, experts
say.
   One is the professional thief who is commissioned to steal
specific works of art.
   ``Mr. Jones might have fallen in love with one of these
paintings and he wants it so bad he can just taste it, so he goes
out and hires someone to steal it,'' explained retired insurance
claims investigator Jim Mellors, who specialized in fine art claims.
   In these cases, Mellors and others said, the stolen item may
wind up in a private collection for years _ or even generations _
and no money changes hands except the fee paid by the collector to
the thief.
   Less common is the collector who steals art himself, such as the
Philadelphia doctor who was arrested in 1982 for ``shoplifting''
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of art from New York
galleries for his lavish personal collection.
   And then, probably most common of all, is the professional thief
who steals art and tries to fence it. Sometimes the thief is
knowledgeable about art; often he is not, as appears to be the case
in the Colnaghi break-in, law enforcement officials say.
   ``It's no secret that thieves who are knowledgeable about art
don't steal well-known pieces,'' said Esterow, who is the author of
the book, ``The Art Stealers.''
   Detective Thomas Moscardini, the New York Police Department's
full-time art crimes investigator, agreed that the Colnaghi thieves
may have blundered when they chose works by Fra Angelico, Jean
Baptiste Simeon Chardin and other Old Masters.
   ``I think it would be difficult to dispose of them because they
were somewhat noted pieces,'' he said. ``You're dealing with
15th-16th century works of art (and) that in itself would bring
some attention.''
   According to the experts, smart thieves steal mid-range art,
preferably works that are similar to others by the same artist.
These works can be sold to unscrupulous or unwitting dealers who
don't conduct thorough background checks. Sometimes they are used
in place of currency in drug transactions.
   The International Foundation for Art Research maintains a list
of art reported stolen. The list now contains 278,000 items and is
regularly sent to law enforcement agencies, museums and galleries.
Between 150 and 300 items are added every month.
   In the case of a major theft like that from the Colnaghi
Gallery, the foundation puts out a worldwide alert, complete with
photographs of the missing pieces. The glare of publicity makes it
hard for a thief, particularly one without connections in the art
world, to sell the stolen goods except at an extreme discount to a
crooked dealer _ or to an insurance company.
   ``What are you going to do with a Fra Angelico?'' asked Esterow.
``How are you going to get rid of it, except by making a deal with
the insurance company?''
   Esterow's remark brings up one of the touchiest subjects for
those who deal with art theft.
   Insurance adjusters routinely deny that they ever pay ransom to
get back a work of art. ``No, no, no, they don't pay ransom,'' said
independent claims adjuster William Smith, who specializes in the
fine arts. ``They pay rewards, which are a different thing. They
will pay to retrieve property under acceptable circumstances. ...
If, for example, an innocent (party) comes forward and gives them
information that leads to recovery.''
   But others say that policy is not strictly followed.
   ``In Europe, (artworks) have been held for ransom for the
insurance company to pay,'' said Manhattan art dealer Arnold
Herstand. ``That's arranged frequently. It's even arranged in New
York City. That's fairly common.''
   In the Colnaghi case, the gallery has announced that its
insurance company was offering a reward _ 10 percent of the value
of the stolen pieces _ for their return.
   ``Final determination of eligibility for payment of the reward
will be made by the donor, not by the New York City Police
Department or any other party,'' the announcement said.
   A spokesman for the gallery, vice president Alan Wintermute,
said he couldn't say if the thieves were among those eligible for
the reward, which could amount to $600,000. It was up to the
insurance company, he said.
   The recovery rate for stolen art is probably no greater than 10
percent, experts say. Enforcement is spotty. New York and Los
Angeles each have one full-time police officer investigating art
crimes; the FBI has one and the U.S. Customs Service has one. They
represent the nation's war on art crime.
   ``It is a big business,'' said Charles Koczka, a retired U.S.
Customs agent who was that agency's specialist in fine art crimes.
``It has a minimal risk of being caught or, if you are caught, of
going to jail. And unfortunately, if you are a victim, you're very
unlikely to recover your property.''

   Members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and
church president and prophet Ezra Taft Benson attended the
inauguration of Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, himself a former Mormon
bishop. Mecham's beliefs are closely tied to church doctrine; his
ties to church leadership strong. So when a storm of turmoil
engulfed the governor, Arizona's Mormon community found itself at
the center.

   Steve Benson has been a life-long Mormon,
active in church affairs. He is the grandson of church president
and prophet Ezra Taft Benson. Few would question his devotion.
   Few, except impeached Gov. Evan Mecham and some of his
supporters.
   Benson happens to be the award-winning cartoonist for the
Arizona Republic _ and a relentless critic of the embattled
governor. Mecham happens to be Arizona's first Mormon governor and
an unwavering believer in conservative church doctrine.
   In Arizona these days, politics and religion are mixing in the
Mormon community. Mormon critics of Mecham have been scorned by
other Mormons, who say they are not true to their religion. Mecham
even once told Steve Benson his salvation was in jeopardy because
of the biting cartoons.
   ``Sides have been taken and swords drawn,'' said the cartoonist.
``There have been instances of shunning. Letters have been written
questioning one's devotion to the church _ whether one has the
moral rectitude to remain in the flock.''
   With the turmoil have come fears that the brouhaha will damage
the image of Mormons, whose roots trace back to the settling of
Arizona.
   Officially, the church has remained neutral on the governor's
plight. Some members say the only mentions of Mecham from the
pulpit have been reminders of neutrality, and the strife is limited
to a small group of Mormons.
   ``Is the church worried? I think not. It's a matter that will
pass in the next few months,'' said Phoenix attorney Dave Udall, a
church leader designated as the official spokesman.
   Still, individuals within the community say passions run deep.
Some say families have been split by the issues.
   Ed Pagan, a Mormon who is a history graduate student at the
University of Arizona and who criticized Mecham in a letter to the
editor, called the turmoil ``gut-wretching'' for church members.
   ``In a sense, his platform and ideology have the veneer of
unofficial church position,'' said Pagan, whose criticism drew
letters questioning his own faith. ``There are those who say if you
criticize Mecham, you're ultimately criticizing God.''
   An unofficial church newspaper, the Latter-Day Sentinel, has
supported Mecham, and its editor, Crismon Lewis, is a sharp critic
of the Republic's Benson. ``Most of the church is extremely
disappointed in him,'' Lewis said.
   One cartoon that rankled Mecham's Mormon supporters showed an
angel atop the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah. At the end of
the angel's trumpet was a banner reading, ``Resign, Ev.''
   Some remember the controversy that surrounded Benson's
grandfather during eight years as agriculture secretary under
President Eisenhower.
   ``His grandfather was attacked so much by the press that he
offered his resignation, but Eisenhower kept him,'' said Lewis.
``Now, a couple of decades later, you've got the grandson doing the
same thing.''
   Benson says his grandfather, a personal friend of Mecham's, has
never pressured him to back off. Church-related pressure in
Arizona, he said, comes from an ultra-conservative sect of the
church _ not the mainstream.
   ``Some individuals _ and it's not unique to my religion _
unavoidably mix religion with politics and as a result think any
Mormon who does not agree with a fellow Latter-day Saint who
happens to be governor is endangering his position in the church,''
Benson said.
   ``It's intolerant, and it's silly.''
   And Benson has support among Mormons _ even among some who
support the governor.
   ``He's got his job to do,'' said Republican state Rep. Jack
Brown, who voted against Mecham's impeachment. ``He can do that and
still be a good member of the Mormon church.''
   Mecham, a 63-year-old native of Duchesne, Utah, was impeached
Feb. 5 by the Arizona House of Representatives on allegations of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from a
special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an
alleged death threat involving a state official.
   Trial on the impeachment is under way in the state Senate. If
convicted, Mecham would be removed from office. He also faces a
criminal trial on the campaign loan charge March 22, and a recall
election set for May 17.
   The ultra-conservative governor took office 14 months ago and
immediately plunged himself into controversy by rescinding the
Martin Luther King holiday for state workers and making statements
that have offended women, homosexuals, Jews and Japanese.
   Mormons believe church leaders receive divine guidance, and some
Mecham backers have suggested political leaders do as well. Mecham
himself has occassionally suggested he's received guidance from God.
   To Shirley Whitlock, active in the church and state leader of a
conservative political group called the Eagle Forum, Mormons who
don't support Mecham have lost their religion.
   ``I feel if there are other members of the church who do not
support the governor they either have allowed themselves to be
propagandized or are too liberal and don't understand their own
teachings,'' Mrs. Whitlock said.
   ``If members of the church can't see this man is trying to do
his duty, then there's false belief,'' she said. ``If they don't
support the governor when he supports Constitutional principles,
then they better do more studying.''
   Passions ran high in the Legislature, too, as the impeachment
vote neared. Rep. Brown, a former Mormon bishop, said he received
letters from followers who tried to intimidate him.
   Rep. Mark Killian, a conservative Republican from Mesa, a
popular Mormon area and site of the church's Arizona Temple, broke
into tears as he blasted the governor's behavior, but voted against
the impeachment because he didn't believe the evidence was strong
enough.
   Udall, the Arizona church spokesman, said he cringes when
Mecham's religion is brought into the debate.
   ``Is religion really a factor? I don't think it is,'' he said.
``And we'd prefer not to be getting the attention.''
   Brown said he worries about possible damage to the church.
   ``But I think people basically understand that you have
different kinds of people in the church, and some are not
reflective of the whole group,'' he said.
   ``It's a concern,'' said Wayne Arnett, an attorney and Mormon.
``There will be those who know Mecham is a Mormon and think less of
me because I'm a Mormon.''
   Most Mormons, Mesa bishop Bob Goodman said, ``are sorry the
church has been involved in it.''
   ``ut I can't say it's hurt any of my members,'' Goodman said.
``And I can't say it's hurt the church. The church is just too
strong for that.''

   Here are excerpts from basic speeches
delivered recently by candidates for the 1988 Republican
presidential nomination:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>GEORGE BUSH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   I think the American people are going to be looking for
leadership.
   You know my background _ combat pilot, serving in the United
States Congress, meeting a payroll, building a business, ambassador
to China, ambassador to the United Nations, running the CIA at a
tough time and head of the (Republican) party, and seven years
standing shoulder to shoulder as vice president with a president
for whom I have great respect. ...
   The presidency is different. It's not like Congress. It's not
business. It's not like anything else when that cable comes in, a
plane's been hit, or an American ship's been shot at or you have to
punish a Marxist or a terrorist dictator like Gadhafi, or have to
take bold action to save American citizens' lives at risk in a tiny
Caribbean country. It's different. ...
   I think the president took the proper steps (when he learned
about the Iran-Contra affair). ...
   Covert action should not be run by the NSC (National Security
Council). It should be run by the CIA. ... I am worried about the
erosion of presidential power. ... Mistakes were made, but we must
move ahead now. ...
   Let's try to hold the highest possible standards (of ethics). It
is an honorable profession, public life. ... I want men and women
of excellence to come and serve, not to profit. ...
   I think that I would be the best for getting this (budget)
deficit down, with a four-year freeze that allows for the growth
and inflation, that will hold the line on taxes but doesn't freeze
in bad programs. ...
   I want to keep the United States strong, offering the hope of
peace and freedom. ... When people go into that (voting) booth,
they're going to be saying, who has the values that we believe in,
who has the breadth of experience, the ability to get people to
work together, and who has the integrity that we trust. ...
   The question is what do we do in the future? ... I believe that
I have had more real life experience than anyone else running
against me, and I am proud to have stood with this president
through thick and through thin, through good times and bad times,
without cutting and running when the going got tough.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BOB DOLE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   I come from a small farming town. I was born and raised in the
values that come from deep roots, deep faith and an abiding love of
country. Russell, Kan., may be a long way off from Atlanta on the
map, but we share a lot of the same values.
   We know the importance of family, of neighbors helping neighbor,
of sticking together in good times and bad. ... I learned ... that
if you worked hard and really believed, you could overcome
hardships and build a better tomorrow. And if your country called _
in war or peace _ you served. ...
   That's how I've always tried to live my life. And that's the
kind of president our country will need to lead us into the 21st
century.
   Values and leadership _ that's what this crucial election is all
about. And, this year ... the South will play a key role in
choosing the man who will sit across the table from Mr. Gorbachev.
...
   The people ... must look at the record and decide which
candidate has demonstrated the strength it takes to stand tough, to
make the hard choices, to forge a consensus that will lead this
nation forward.
   Which candidate's leadership got President Reagan's tax cut
passed.
   Whose leadership stopped the liberals from repealing those tax
cuts.
   Whose leadership put together the plan which saved Social
Security from bankruptcy.
   Whose leadership produced a majority of votes in the Senate for
aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.
   Whose leadership lined up the votes to keep the president's
Strategic Defense Initiative alive.
   And whose leadership produced the 1985 farm bill to save the
family farm.
   Bob Dole led each one of the battles in the U.S. Senate. And we
won. No other candidate in this race can match that record. No one.
   That's the true test of leadership. Not how many jobs we've had,
but what you've done in the jobs you've held. And that speaks
volumes for what you'll do as president.
   There's no instant, magic formula to make the deficit vanish.
But, with the right leadership, we can start solving the problem.
   There's no miracle cure to make freedom safe in a dangerous
world. But the right leadership can do it.
   There's no quick fix to make America competitive again, an
opportunity society where all our people can rise as high as their
God-given talents will take them. But leadership can make it happen.
   There's no easy way out of the plague of drug abuse, the decline
in values and education, the high cost of health care and so many
other urgent problems. But they can be solved.
   These are all tough challenges. It's going to take tough,
dedicated, understanding leadership to overcome them. ... I believe
that I can deliver the kind of leadership we need.

   No public policy decision we make in the next 10 years ... will
be as important as the decisions we make about defending and
nurturing and strengthening the bedrock of Western values _ our
families and our children.
   There is no better school, no better engine of economic growth
or job training, savings and investment than the traditional
family. There is no greater moral teacher, disciplinarian, help for
the weak, protector of the young, or builder of character than the
family.
   Our Democratic friends urge us to look to government as mother
and father, but they have it exactly backwards. ...
   I believe that America needs a rebirth of respect and compassion
for the value and the dignity and the sanctity of each and every
child and every human life. ...
   I have pledged that, as president, I will help lead America to
its highest standards of educational excellence _ not by expanding
budgets or new government programs, but through reforms that stress
the ABCs of education:
   A _ restoring accountability by granting parents greater
oversight and greater choice. ... B _ renewing stronger emphasis on
a basic core curriculum of English, science, math, history and
computer and vocational skills and expecting superior levels of
achievement to be met. C _ building and developing character. ...
   We've put forth a three-part plan to stop the spread of AIDS:
First, routine testing to help identify those infected; second,
confidential sharing of this information by public health
authorities with those in danger of infection; and, third, common
sense education that teaches right and wrong about the sexual
behavior that spreads AIDS.
   We must do everything we can to find a cure. We must treat AIDS
victims with compassion and give them care. But we must also give
the American people confidence that we have a plan and that we will
stop AIDS, now, not later. ...
   Our liberal friends tell us that we need ... activist judges.
Well, I agree. We need activist judges who actively support the
Constitution.
   We live in a democracy and it is the right and the
responsibility of the people and their representatives to decide
fundamental questions of public policy _ it is not, and must never
be the right and responsibility of judicial elites to appropriate
that right and responsibility to themselves.

   If we are to recapture the greatness of America we must go back
to our fundamental faith in God. And when we train our children ...
it is absolutely crucial that we teach them the moral values of our
society. Little children must once again be allowed to pray in the
schools of America.
   When our ancestors came to these shores ... there was one thing
that was uppermost in the minds of the people. They believed in
individual self-reliance. ... When they went across these plains
... when they made an empire out of a wilderness ... when they
fought disease and battled enemies, when they endured privation,
hunger and starvation, they relied on their own initiative under
God.
   And if we are going to be strong we must recognize that we as a
people can do it ourselves. Government doesn't give us our freedom.
Government can't take our freedom away from us. It is a gift of God
given every one of us. ...
   We have built in this nation with 200 years of labor a
magnificent industrial base. But over the last few years of this
decade we have seen our industries slowly crumbling, some of our
basic industries going overseas to other nations. ...
   Recently I was in one of the Southern states and I learned of
1,000 factories that have closed. I learned of 300,000 people who
lost their jobs. And they told me about them, and they said: Are
you aware that imports to this country of the particular product
they were mentioning, textiles, from mainland China have risen from
230 million yards to 1.8 billion yards. ... Are you aware, they
told me, that from January of 1986 until November of 1987 that
imports of textiles from the Soviet Union had risen by 7,000
percent. ...
   If the communist countries want to help their workers, that's
fine. ... But I think the time has come in America when we no
longer are going to allow our basic industries to be destroyed and
our people put out of work in order to enhance the standard of
living of communist China and communist Russia. ...
   Recently, the Congress of the United States refused to vote
military aid to assist the freedom fighters of the Contras in
Nicaragua. I do not think it is in the best interest of the United
States of America to permit the Soviet Union to establish a land
base in the North American continent.

presidential nomination:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reaganomics isn't economic theory, it's theft from our children,
it's a felony against the future, and it has played the
hard-working, taxpaying families of middle America for fools.
   We're not going to get our fiscal house in order with more
voodoo economics. And we're not going to meet the challenges of the
1990s by building walls around America. We tried that 60 years ago
and it gave us the worst depression in our history.
   We need more trade, not less. One and a quarter million Southern
workers depend on exports for their jobs. They know that if we're
going to make America No. 1 again, we've got to do more than wave a
fist at our foreign competitors; we've got to roll up our sleeves,
go to work, and beat them.
   They deserve a president who knows how to balance a budget and
mop up Republican red ink _ and has done it. A president who knows
how to build a strong economy _ and has done it. A president who
has been tested in the fires of debt and deficit and hard economic
times. A president with the strength, the skills and the values to
take charge of our economic future and get our nation moving again.
...
   It's going to take hard workers, not high-rollers, to get
America moving again.
   And it'll take Star Schools, not Star Wars, to conquer the next
American frontier.
   The world is changing; we must change with it _ or we'll be left
behind. We must invest in research. We must invest in new ideas.
And we must turn those new ideas into new products and new jobs for
our citizens and new markets for America. ...
   American workers know that we're not going to beat the Japanese
and our other competitors by sitting on the sidelines; we're not
going to beat them by pitting group against group and region
against region; we're not going to beat them by investing in a
fantasy called Star Wars; and we're not going to beat them unless
we've got someone in the White House who looks a little farther
into the future than the next vote on Contra aid. ...
   There are no shortcuts to greatness for America. Because the
best America does not hide; it competes. The best America does not
waste; it invests. The best America does not leave some of its
citizens behind; it works for everyone.

   If Americans want leadership to trim and then tend to things as
they are, they will turn to the Republicans. Our purpose, and our
appeal as Democrats, has always been to serve as an instrument of
change. ...
   The central issue of this campaign is whether Americans will
regain control of our own destiny. In recent years, that control
has been lost to foreign powers and private interests. ...
   First, we lost much of our steel industry; now we are losing
whole segments of the computer industry. First, we were told that
free trade permitted our farmers to sell abroad; now they are being
locked out of the European market. We devalue the dollar, hoping to
sell our goods cheaper abroad _ and then trade barriers still bar
the way _ and the trade deficit with Japan roars on. ...
   We refuse to accept the decline of America. We are tried to
hearing from those who say it is inevitable ... that we can't stand
up for America anymore. And we are determined that we can and will
reassert this nation's rightful role of leadership in the world
economy. ...
   On the central economic issues of this campaign, there is hardly
a dime's worth of difference between Governor Dukakis and Senator
Gore. And while I may disagree with Jesse Jackson in a number of
important areas, let me say in fairness that he is speaking to
fundamental questions _ and he surely does have something to say
about them.
   The Gore-Dukakis approach is to distract the voters from those
fundamental questions _ to divert the campaign to tactics, or drown
it in generalities. ...
   This approach is a political danger for Democrats; the stale and
standard rhetoric of a careful, conventional politics will never
bring us back the voters we need for victory.
   But the true danger is to the nation. We can no longer afford to
ignore the larger forces that could constrict our economy and our
future. We have to revive America's productive might. ...
   I am not willing to see America fall behind. I do not doubt the
energy, the capacity, the strength or the talent of the American
people. And I am certain that if they are given the chance, this
nation can and will continue to lead the world.

   We want a nominee who doesn't just appeal to a collection of
narrow interest agendas. We want a nominee who speaks common sense
to voters at the grass roots level. ...
   And my campaign is about bringing the Democratic Party back to
the grass roots level. I want to put the White House back on the
side of the average working men and women in this country. ...
   Voters ... have asked themselves: Is the Democratic Party
straying from its traditions? Well, our traditions are economic
growth, jobs, prosperity, social progress with a movement toward
social justice and a strong, intelligent role for this country in
the world.
   Now that's the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and
John Kennedy. ... That's the approach that I'm taking in my
campaign. ...
   This is a time for fundamental change in America.
   We are facing a storm on the horizon. We must understand it
clearly. ... We must become one nation, united in clearly
recognizing that in order to compete more effectively overseas we
have to batten down the hatches and make some major changes in this
nation. ...
   We have to create the best schools in the world. ... I look at
children in all the states around this nation where I compete.
Their eyes are just as bright, their minds are just as sharp as
those of the children of any nation on the face of this Earth.
   Are we to be satisfied that by the time children graduate from
high school in America, on average they are two full grade levels
behind their counterparts in other nations? Are we going to allow
that to continue? ...
   It's time we had a president of the United States who didn't act
the way Ronald Reagan does and every time a decision comes up ask,
``What is going to best for the executives in the board room?''
   It's time we asked the Democratic question, ``What's best for
the guy on the assembly line, the guy on the farm, the woman behind
the word processor, the woman behind the typewriter. ...
   This is the challenge. ... We know from experience that if we
follow policies that are designed to help the person at the grass
roots level, ... if we consistently have the guts and fortitude and
leadership and courage to stand by them and follow policies to
benefit them, then in the long run that is going to lift the
prospects of the entire nation.

   For more than a decade I've worked with others to create ideas
that reform our public policies and systems. Many of our society's
institutions require reform. But reform is a threatening notion. It
threatens long-established arrangements among individuals and
institutions and powerful positions that some have fought long and
hard to win.
   Reform cannot be imposed from the top down, especially against a
hostile institution. It must percolate from the bottom up. That
means that ordinary people must provide the fuel for change.
Soldiers, nurses, teachers, workers are the key to reform. And that
reform can only begin when people begin to think differently.
   We have to think differently about our relationships with the
Soviets and how we engage them in a new and different world.
   We have to think differently about how we provide better medical
care and for whom we should provide.
   We have to think differently about how we educate our young
people and what kind of education we are providing.
   We have to think differently about how we manufacture goods as
well as what kind of products we ought to be making.
   We must raise non-traditional, non-conventional questions in
this election year because the United States has been desperately
trying to preserve an elusive status quo for 25 years while an
often brutally contrary world prevents it. ...
   Resistance to reform and change is resistance to a new
generation and a new way of thinking, and the resistance to me and
my candidacy is in large part a resistance to a new generational
understanding of a world where the old arrangements and old rules
no longer work.
   But it's not simply an age question, it's an attitudinal divide.
...
   Although most in this race are of the same generation, there are
real differences in outlook and attitude among the candidates. ...
   This campaign _ like every other presidential campaign _ is
about power, who will serve in the most powerful office on Earth.
But it's also about who has the power to elect our national leader.
   Traditional politics says that party leaders, pundits and
political experts should decide who the candidates will be. But
reform politics, new politics, my politics say let's let the people
decide.

   We gather here in this new South with new challenges. Every
generation has faced the challenge of securing for all citizens
equal protection under the law, to have the umbrella of law
broadened so when the rains do fall, all are protected.
   In 1960, four students in Greensboro, at A&T, (North Carolina
A&T State University, Jackson's alma mater) went to Woolworth's
lunch counter. They sat in to get hamburgers; they got handcuffs.
They were challenged. They were arrested. They chose dignity even
over degrees. They heard the call of their day.
   Throughout that period, young America did not just rest in false
comforts, or retreat through drugs ... young Americans led the way,
and assumed a front-line position. It's not enough for you to vote
for me, young Americans. You must register, vote, run for office,
win and make a difference.
   Things will not change automatically and inevitably. They will
change because you work to make them change. You must make it
happen. ...
   We do have a public accommodations bill, and that's progress. We
do have the right to vote, and that's progress. We do have open
housing, and that's progress. We do have equal access to education,
and that's progress. But then there is the unfinished business of
economic justice and world peace.
   Let us not forget the garbage workers in Memphis had civil
rights, had the right to vote. When they came home from work ...
they did not have enough money to pay their basic family bills. The
agenda there was economic justice for working people who did not
want welfare, didn't want workfare, they wanted to get paid for
working. The agenda was economic justice. They were abandoned by
law. ...
   Now we need the law to raise the minimum wage ... to establish a
national health care plan for the American people. We need to
change the law and choose Head Start and day care over jail care
and welfare. ...
   We the people must come together. ... We must struggle to raise
the standard of living for working people. Stop drugs from coming
in. Stop jobs from going out.
   The challenge was to make certain that no one with a sheet and a
hood would lynch us. Today's challenge ... is not the rope, it's
dope. Coke. Crack. Heroin. PCP. Every gain we ever made is
threatened by drugs.
   It's a cop-out to just say to children, `just say no to drugs.'
... Children do not buy $150 billion worth of drugs. ... Children
do not grow the drugs, do not run the cartels.
   The money involved in drug smuggling is corrupting whole
governments. ... We must stop the flow of drugs into our country.
It's corrupting our society. If elected, I will ... cut the supply
of drugs. But you the people must cut the demand for drugs.

   We have to see that jobs are there for people, good jobs,
primarily through the private sector.
   One of the things we have to do is deal with those who have
fallen through the cracks.
   We have something in our society called the underclass. Some
people don't like the use of the term, but it is real, it is there.
There is no sense fooling ourselves.
   We ought to give the people an opportunity. ... We can do better
as a nation. We're not just talking statistics. ... We're talking
about people.
   We're talking about the young man ... desperate for a job ...
the man whose business has failed (who) asked the question, ``Does
anyone care?'' Only he really wasn't asking a question. He was
really saying, ``No one cares.''
   I want a government that cares. I want a government that's going
to fight for opportunities for our people and stand up for the
less-fortunate.
   Education has to receive much greater attention. ... One of
things that has been happening is that there has been a substantial
shift away from grants to loans.
   Now, there are problems with that. One of the problems is that
sometimes two of you who have loans fall in love and decide to get

   The government's chief barometer of future
economic activity fell again in January, but an upward revision in
December has eased some economists' fears that the nation was
headed for a recession.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators dropped 0.6 percent in January. Analysts
discounted the sharp decline and instead focused on a revision that
changed the index's showing in December from a 0.2 percent decline
to a 0.3 percent rise.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell Bids For J.P. Stevens; Management Revises Its
Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   J.P. Stevens & Co., months ago a rumored
takeover target, now finds itself fielding three rival offers from
a management-led group, industry competitor West Point-Pepperell
Inc. and an undisclosed suitor.
   West Point-Pepperell said Tuesday it had offered to pay $56 a
share for Stevens, or about $867 million, in a negotiated buyout.
   The textile company actually had delivered its offer to Stevens
late Monday.
   On Tuesday, the J.P. Stevens management group led by Chairman
Whitney Stevens said it was increasing its own outstanding
leveraged buyout offer to $55 a share in cash and securities, or
about $850 million.
   Stevens also disclosed it had received a third, unidentified
offer.
   Stevens stock jumped $6.25 a share to $54.50 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange. West Point-Pepperell was unchanged at $30.50 a
share.
   The management group offered to pay $40 in cash and $15 in
securities for each of Stevens' 15.5 million common shares
outstanding in a leveraged buyout.
   The group, led by the fifth generation member of the family that
founded Stevens in 1813, initially offered on Feb. 8 to pay a total
of $43 a share in cash and securities, or about $666.5 million.
   West Point said its $56 a share cash offer was not conditioned
on the availability of financing and indicated it was considering
the sale of certain Stevens assets to avoid antitrust concerns.
   Stevens indicated in a news release that its outside directors
were reviewing the revised management proposal and had authorized
the company's financial advisers to study the two outside proposals.
   Jim Franklin, a spokesman for Stevens, declined to comment
beyond the news release.
   A number of industry experts had predicted higher offers would
emerge following the management group's initial offer, which widely
was viewed as too low.
   Stevens is one of the nation's biggest textile producers,
concentrating on home fashion textiles such as sheets, towels and
carpets under the brand names Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley and Pierre
Cardin. The company also makes automotive products and industrial
fabrics.
   West Point, based in West Point, Ga., also is a major household
fabrics maker, producing brands such a Arrow, Martex, Lady
Pepperell, Burberry's and Cabin Crafts.
   Joseph L. Lanier Jr., chairman of West Point-Pepperell, said an
acquisition of Stevens would be a natural step in his company's
shift toward consumer goods and away from commodity textiles, which
have lower profit margins and suffer from intense foreign
competition.
   West Point-Pepperell acquired Cluett-Peabody & Co. in 1986 as
part of the strategy.
   Stevens undertook a similar strategy beginning in 1984, moving
out of apparel fabrics and shifting its manufacturing to home
textiles such as sheets and towels. The success of that effort is
one factor that made Stevens an attractive takeover target.
   ``That's one of the great strengths of J.P. Stevens,'' Lanier
said in an interview. ``It's playing to our strength as we see it.''
   During the quarter ended Jan. 30, Stevens posted an after-tax
profit of $12.9 million, up from $11.9 million a year earlier.
Sales rose to $381.48 million from $361.67 million a year earlier.
   In the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, Stevens earned $56 million on
sales of $1.6 billion. This compared with a profit of $53.7 million
on revenue of $1.68 billion in 1986.
   West Point-Pepperell reported a profit of $25.5 million on
revenue of $480.9 million for the fiscal first quarter, which ended
Dec. 26. That was up from $20.9 million in profit and $422.7
million in revenue during a year earlier.
   Stevens said the securities portion of the management group's
offer would include $10 in market value of junior subordinated
debentures and $5 market value of preferred stock paying a dividend
in cash or additional shares.

   Apollo Computer Inc. got a key jump on its
competitors by developing a $70,000 desktop ``personal
supercomputer'' the company says is faster than anything else in
the market, industry analysts said.
   Two other companies also announced new supercomputers Tuesday,
marking what promises to be a period of fierce competition among
makers of sophisticated supercomputers used by scientists and
engineers.
   ``This seems to be the year for the so-called `personal
supercomputer,''' said Gary P. Smaby, who follows the industry for
Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. ``I think it's going to be
an interesting horse race.''
   Apollo said it was producing a workstation for scientists and
engineers with supercomputer power that outperforms anything in its
price range of $69,900 to $130,000.
   Analysts said the Domain Series 10000 returns the Chelmsford,
Mass.-based company to the forefront of the highly competitive
field of small, powerful workstations that combine extremely rapid
``number cruching'' with three-dimensional graphics.
   ``We think that this definitely positions them as the
performance leader to beat in the new graphics supercomputing
market,'' said David Burdick, an analyst with Dataquest Inc. of San
Jose, Calif.
   ``For a company that has been stuck in the Saragasso Sea in the
past couple of years, it is very siginificant'' said Donald Bellomy
of International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``They had been
the industry leaders in every aspect and had fallen behind in every
aspect.''
   Ardent Computer Corp., a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based start-up,
announced its first product Tuesday, a graphics supercomputer in
about the same price and performance range as Apollo's.
   Convex Computer Corp. of Richardson, Texas, aiming at a pricier
segment of the market, unveiled a more powerful new line of
mini-supercomputers it hopes will cut into Cray Research Inc.'s
domination of that market.
   Another recent start-up, Stellar Computer Inc. of Newton, Mass.,
is expected to announce a similar graphics supercomputer in two
weeks, and analysts anticipate a half-dozen more to follow.
   ``Scientists and engineers are making pretty interesting use of
these computers,'' Smaby said. ``The question is how big a market
is there for a $100,000 single-user computer.''
   ``They're all vying for market share leadership in one niche or
another and not all of them are going to come out with gold
medals,'' he said.
   Apollo, which pioneered workstations in 1980, said at a Boston
news conference that the new model speeds up complex numerical
computations and its four-processor model allows several different
programs to run simultaneously.
   Ardent said its graphics supercomputer would range in price from
$79,000 for a one-processor model to $150,000 for a four-processor
model that will be available later this year.
   Ardent, founded in 1985, is run by two prominent figures in the
computer industry: Allen H. Michels, the president and chief
executive, who previously founded Convergent Technologies, and C.
Gordon Bell, the vice president of research, engineering and
development, who did pioneering work in a 23-year career at Digital
Equipment Corp.
   But analysts agree Apollo's 50,000 workstations and 1,800
software packages already on the market give it a competitive
advantage. The company said it will begin selling the models in the
third quarter this year and announce improved graphics system for
the workstation later this year.
   Convex Computer introduced a line of six mini-supercomputers
that range in power up to the level of conventional supercomputers.
In San Francisco, Convex said it invented a new kind of parallel
processing for its bigger models that keeps processors from being
idle by allocating work among them efficiently.
   Convex's new computers range in price from $275,000 to $1.3
million and are up to 10 times as powerful as its current models.
Convex claimed the most powerful model, the C240, is faster than
Cray Research Inc.'s X-MP 14, which costs $5.5 million.

<HEAD>Heyman Group Sweetens GAF Buyout Offer; Shareholders To Decide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GAF Corp. shareholders will have the chance
to vote on a sweetened $1.4 billion leveraged buyout offer from a
group led by Chairman Samuel J. Heyman, but may get competing
offers to consider.
   GAF's board of directors agreed Tuesday to submit the offer to
shareholders ``without endorsement,'' after the group increased its
bid from a previous $1.35 billion cash and securities package.
   The company also instructed its financial adviser to seek out
other potential purchasers, and left itself the option of accepting
any competing, superior offer.
   The Heyman group on Tuesday proposed to pay $46 in cash and
junior securities with a face value of $6.50 for each of GAF's 27.7
million outstanding common shares.
   In December, the Heyman group offered $1.35 billion, or $40 in
cash and $8.50 in securities per share.
   That offer was a downward revision from its initial $2.3 billion
offer, made in September, of $64 in cash and $2.50 face value in
debt securities. Heyman revised the initial proposal due to rising
interest rates stemming from unsettled conditions in the market for
high-yield ``junk bonds'' following the October stock market crash.
   In order for shareholders to vote on the latest buyout offer,
they first first vote on an amendment to the company charter. The
amendment would allow shareholders to act in place of the board in
considering a merger offer, as the Heyman-led proposal has been
presented.
   A special committee of the board of directors had rejected the
initial $64-a-share proposal as inadequate. GAF said it had decided
to let stockholders decide based on the favorable opinion of the
offer by Salomon Brothers Inc., the committee's financial adviser.
   The committee also instructed Salomon to solicit other possible
purchasers, GAF said. The committee said that if it receives an
``economically superior alternative proposal'' for GAF, it could
cancel its agreement with the buyout group.
   ``We think the price is a fare and full price,'' Heyman said.
``It's seven times the price of the stock only four years ago.''
   GAF also said it had reached tentative settlements of lawsuits
brought in connection with the buyout offer.
   GAF stock rose 25 cents to $50.25 a share Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Heyman, who wrested control of GAF in 1983 after a bitter proxy
fight to oust former Chairman Jesse Werner, has said that taking
GAF private would give the company more leeway to pursue
acquisitions without having to worry about short-term shareholder
value.
   Since taking over GAF, Heyman has led the company on
unsuccessful but profitable attempted takeovers of Union Carbide
Corp. and Borg-Warner Corp.
   Heyman owns 2.8 million shares of GAF, or about 10 percent of
its outstanding stock.

<TEXT>
   Ten years ago a Monterrey company
promoting membership at a new Pacific coast resort hotel offered a
special deal: ``Buy now and your 10-year lease will be renewed at
the same price in 1988.''
   But inflation and the devaluation of the peso since then have
made the deal even more special than anyone anticipated: the
average 70,000 peso price for the leases in 1978, worth the
equivalent of $3,182 back then, now equals just $30.
   Hotel clients in this northern industrial city are complaining
that the company is balking at renewing the time-sharing leases at
the cheaper price.
   They estimate that about 1,000 people throughout Mexico paid an
average of 70,000 pesos in 1978 to spend one week each year at the
luxury hotel Club Maeva in Manzanillo in the Pacific coastal state
of Colima.
   The hotel is run by Casolar, the tourism division of the huge
Monterrey-based Alfa conglomerate.
   Alfa fell into a severe economic crisis along with the rest of
Mexico in 1982 and has seen the value of Mexico's currency plunge
from 22 pesos to the dollar in 1978 to 2,350 to the dollar now.
   The peso devaluation has made the 70,000-peso fee equal to $30,
about the price of dinner for two in a nice restaurant. But clients
here say they took the gamble a decade ago when they invested in a
hotel complex that was under construction.
   ``We know it's very little money now. But, remember, nothing was
built at the time. It was an enormous risk,'' said Concepcion
Rodriguez de Salazar, who sold herself one of the contracts 10
years ago when she worked as a Casolar sales representative.
   Her son, Monterrey lawyer Jorge Salazar, says Casolar now wants
to charge 10 million pesos _ $4,255 _ to renew the contract.
Salazar is handling the complaints for about 60 hotel clients here.
   ``The company didn't have any idea that things were going to
turn out as they did. But the people that bought there didn't
expect the company to decide whether or not it was going to
comply,'' Salazar said.
   Martha Barrios of Casolar said on Monday and Tuesday that
officials involved in the contract dispute were in meetings or out
of town and not available for comment.
   Salazar said in a telephone interview late Monday that his
clients want him to negotiate with Casolar, but he has been unable
to locate company officials.
   ``These people had to sacrifice to pay the fee 10 years ago, but
they thought they'd get 20 years of vacations,'' Salazar said.
   He said the peso-dollar equivalent had nothing to do with the
written contract. The renewal offer was in the contract as well as
the company's advertising, he said.
   ``We don't earn dollars or spend dollars or do business in
dollars,'' he said. ``We still have faith in what a contract says.''

<HEAD>KaiserTech Sues Chairman To Recover Stock Trading Profit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   KaiserTech Ltd. has taken the unusual step of
suing its own chairman of the board, in an attempt to recover
profits made from his short-term dealings in the aluminum company's
stock.
   The suit filed Tuesday against Alan E. Clore came a day after
the reclusive British investor agreed to sell his 27 percent stake
in KaiserTech to Texas oilman Charles Hurwitz, a move that appeared
to irritate KaiserTech officials and signaled management turbulence
at the Oakland, Calif.-based company.
   Clore acquired his position at KaiserTech after a lengthy
takeover struggle last year. Hurwitz's intentions toward KaiserTech
remain unclear.
   Asked if it was considered unusual that a company would sue its
own chairman, KaiserTech spokesman Robert W. Irelan said: ``It's
the first time we've done it.''
   KaiserTech stated that its suit filed in a Manhattan federal
court resulted from Clore's disclosures in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing on Monday about his sale of stock to a
Hurwitz-controlled company, Los Angeles-based Maxxam Group Inc.
   KaiserTech contended the SEC disclosures showed Clore and his
affiliates made about $4 million in undisclosed profits via
so-called ``short-swing trading'' _ trading done within a six-month
period _ of KaiserTech stock.
   Under federal securities law, a company or its stockholders are
entitled to recover such profits from a director or officer who
engages in short-swing trading.
   Clore, who usually resides in Switzerland, could not be reached
for comment on the lawsuit, which was part of a rapid series of
events concerning KaiserTech stock.
   In Los Angeles, the investment firm Jefferies & Co. said it was
selling 1.39 million shares of KaiserTech stock to Maxxam for
$16.68 million or $12 a share.
   Combined with the 6.2 million shares acquired from Clore, plus
an option to buy his 8.2 million convertible preferred KaiserTech
shares, acquisition of Jefferies' stake would give Maxxam about
one-third of KaiserTech's approximately 45 million shares
outstanding.
   But Wall Street's reaction indicated skepticism about a possible
takeover move. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading,
KaiserTech fell 12{ cents a share to $11.75, after rising $1.12{ in
the previous session.
   KaiserTech had stated Monday it would have preferred that Clore
had sold his stock to a broader range of investors, reflecting
concern about what Maxxam intended to do with its stake. Maxxam
officials said it was premature to speculate on whether the comapny
would attempt to acquire more KaiserTech shares.
   Clore's maneuvering to sell his KaiserTech shares came against a
background of heavy pressure on him to cut losses suffered in the
October stock market crash.
   If Clore hadn't found a buyer by a Monday deadline, he could
have faced default on loans he had obtained by using Kaiser stock
as collateral. After the stock plunged in October, lenders wanted
repayment.
   His sale of stock came as the company was rebounding from six
straight years of losses. Kaiser has sold its chemical, oil and gas
businesses, slashed debt and concentrated on its core aluminum
business.

<HEAD>Memo: Tobacco Industry Worked To `Create Doubt' About Cigarette
Risks</HEAD>

   The Lorillard Inc. tobacco company sought to
downplay discounts that its insurance company affiliate was
considering offering to non-smokers several years ago, according to
evidence in a lawsuit against three cigarette makers.
   The contention was made Tuesday as a federal jury heard
testimony and read documents that allegedly show the tobacco
industry sought to suppress information on the health dangers of
smoking.
   The suit filed by Antonio Cipollone of Lakehurst, claims
Lorillard, Philip Morris Co. and Liggett Group Inc., are liable for
the lung cancer death of his wife Rose, a 40-year smoker.
   Cipollone alleges the companies failed to do enough research on
cigarettes, did not reveal what they did know, failed to warn the
public of health dangers and did not put a safer product on the
market.
   One document released Tuesday, dated March 3, 1980, was written
by Chicago-based CNA Insurance Co. officials and discussed a
recommendation for non-smoker discounts, according to Marc Z.
Edell, Cipollone's attorney.
   At the time, CNA was owned by Loew's Theatres Inc., which also
owned Lorillard. Loew's has since sold the tobacco company.
   ``It is recognized that the introduction of non-smokers discount
could prove embarrassing'' to Loew's and Lorillard, the memo
stated. In order to minimize the potential for embarrassment, it
suggested that CNA and Lorillard jointly prepare a carefully
constructed statement saying the discount ``in no way supports or
refutes the contention that smoking causes health defects.''
   ``CNA should further refrain from advertising or otherwise
promoting non-smoker discounts,'' it continued.
   The issue also was discussed in a letter dated Nov. 5, 1979,
from Lorillard senior vice president and general counsel, Arthur J.
Stevens, to CNA Chairman Edward J. Noha.
   Stevens wrote that when the cigarette manufacturing trade group,
the Tobacco Insitute, heard of Allstate Insurance Co.'s plan to
offer a non-smoker discount the institute sought help from CNA ``in
an effort to perhaps dissuade Allstate from that course of action
by supplying background data.''
   Lorillard spokesman Chuck Wall said Lorillard and the institute
did nothing improper but merely were trying to counteract
anti-cigarette propaganda.
   According to another document released Tuesday, a Tobacco
Institute official stated in 1972 that the industry's defense
against cigarette critics included ``creating doubt about the
health charge without actually denying it.''
   The internal memorandum describes the ``three major fronts'' _
litigation, politics and public opinion _ where the tobacco
companies had fought to defend itself.
   The ``brilliantly conceived and executed'' strategy, used in all
three areas, helped ``win important battles,'' said the memo.
   However, ``it is only fair to say that it is not _ nor was it
intended to be _ a vehicle for victory,'' said the May 1, 1972 memo
from Fred Panzer to Horace R. Kornegay, president of the Tobacco
Institute.
   Wall identified Panzer as an institute vice president.
   The document says the industry had followed a ``holding
strategy, consisting of:
   _creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying
it;
   _advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging
them to take up the practice;
   _encouraging objective scientific research as the only way to
resolve the question of health hazard.''

   General Motors Corp.'s plastic-body,
mid-engine Pontiac Fiero and the workers who make it have become
the first victims of slumping popularity for sporty two-seaters.
   Michael Losh, Pontiac's general manager, said Tuesday GM will
stop making the Fiero after the 1988 model and will close
indefinitely the single Fiero plant here sometime this summer,
idling 1,109 workers.
   ``The whole market's dead,'' said industry analyst Chris
Cedergren of J.D. Power and Associates, blaming high insurance
rates for a 30 percent drop in overall two-seater sales during 1987.
   The slump has not spared Japanese automakers, who report slow
sales of cars such as the sporty Toyota MR2 and the Mazda RX7, or
Europeans, whose victims include four-cylinder Porsches.
   In addition to flagging sales, Fiero had suffered problems that
included frequent engine fires, which prompted GM to recall the
entire 1984 mode production run late last year. But Losh and
Cedergren suggested the market killed the Fiero.
   ``We have seen a switch away from the high volumes of people who
were willing to buy two-seat cars with limited luggage capacity,''
Losh said. ``We led the world into this (market) segment and we may
lead a piece of the world out of it.''
   Fiero sales peaked at 101,720 cars in 1984 and fell to 47,156 in
1987. Sales for the 1988 model year, which began Oct. 1, are less
than 10,000, 41 below the same point in the 1987 model year.
   But before it died, Losh said, the Fiero helped create a new,
performance-oriented image for Pontiac. He refused to speculate on
whether the Fiero plant might reopen to build a new Pontiac or GM
product.
   Union and city officials said they were surprised by the Fiero
decision despite the car's poor sales. When the Fiero is gone, no
Pontiacs will be built in Pontiac.
   UAW Local 653 President Harold Cox said his plant was one of the
first at GM to accept Japanese-style team organization of workers
under a contract that allowed the previously closed plant to reopen
in 1983 to make the Fiero.
   ``We're going to continue to try to persuade General Motors to
try to put something in there,'' Cox said. ``It's a slap in our
face that they rewarded us this way.''
   GM already has closed a foundry, another car assembly plant, a
heavy-duty truck plant and a bus plant in Pontiac and had cut
production at the Fiero plant several times, putting more than
1,200 other Fiero workers on layoff.
   Dealers said they also were surprised by the announcement and
some expressed disappointment.
   ``We don't have anything else in my opinion that would fit in
that category,'' said Buzz Sawyers, owner of Sawyers Pontiac in
Lansing. ``It's like a cheap Corvette.''
   Pontiac spokesman Reginald Harris said GM will make sure parts
are available for the Fiero into the future.
   GM's contract with the United Auto Workers union forbids
permanent plant closings that were not announced before the
contract was signed last fall, but permits laying off workers if
sales slow.
   The Fiero plant is the third GM has decided to idle since then.
The first, in Framingham, Mass., will return to production in May.
The second, in Kansas City, Mo., will shut down April 15, idling
1,600 workers.

<HEAD>Texas Oilmen Undertake Tender Offer for Gypsum Producer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp., a leading producer of building
materials, has urged shareholders to resist a $1.9 billion tender
offer from a partnership led by two Texas oilmen.
   The $42-a-share offer for about 21.5 million shares of USG stock
was unveiled Tuesday by Desert Partners LP, which is headed by Jack
E. Brown and Cyril Wagner Jr.
   Desert Partners already owns about 9.9 percent or 5.08 million
of USG's approximately 50.8 million shares outstanding.
   After the tender offer was announced, USG issued a statement
asking shareholders to hold onto their stock until the board had a
chance to act on the matter.
   The company has stated repeatedly that it wants to remain
independent. Lasat week USG rejected the partnership's lateset
takeover proposal, also valued at $42 a share.
   In a separate filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Desert Partners said it would seek to elect six
directors to USG's 15-member board at the company's annual meeting
in May.
   Desert Partners said Wells Fargo Bank had pledged $500 million
in financing for the offer and would attempt to arrange $525
million more in financing from other banks.
   Wall Street analysts have speculated that Wagner and Brown
aren't interested in acquiring USG but want to boost the value of
their stake, purchased last year for about $44.30 a share for an
earlier takeover attempt that fizzled.
   In recent weeks USG stock had been trading around $28 a share,
but the price started rising when rumors surfaced late last month
that Wagner and Brown would make another run at the company.
   USG rose $2.75 to $40.12{ on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   Based in Chicago, USG is a leading producer of gypsum and
building materials, with about 100 plants nationwide.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgium's central bank on Wednesday
announced cuts in two key interest rates to reflect the current
strength of the Belgian franc and international trends.
   The Belgian national bank said it will lower the discount rate
to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent and the Lombard rate to 6.75
percent from 7 percent, effective Thursday.
   The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges to
member banks. The Lombard rate is interest charged on central bank
loans that use securities as collateral.
   The bank said in a statement the decision was made ``in
recognition of recent rate cuts in the domestic and international
money markets'' and due to the stability of the Belgian franc.
   The bank last cut its Lombard and discount rates on January 28.
   The three-month money market rate, the single-most important
leading rate on the Belgian market, also has been cut five times
since the beginning of the year.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Brussels said the franc had not
registered any noticeable reaction to the news.

   South Korea's trade surplus more than
tripled in February from a year earlier on the strength of exports,
the government reported Wednesday.
   The Trade and Industry Ministry said last month's surplus rose
to $524 million from $158 million in 1987. That brought the surplus
for the first two months of this year to $810 million from $683
million last year, it said.
   Exports in February rose 41 percent to $4.1 billion from, while
imports grew 30 percent to $3.57 billion.
   The ministry did not provide a breakdown by country.
   During 1987, South Korea posted a trade surplus of $6.26 billion.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Urged To Begin Legal Slowdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters union is urging Northwest
Airlines' 6,700 flight attendants to use whatever measures they can
to slow their performance without breaking the law or company rules.
   ``At this time we want to keep the company confused and very
busy,'' said a recorded message that answered a union telephone
Tuesday.
   The recording urged tactics that included filing paperwork on
each piece of broken equipment at each stop during a flight and
slowing down everyday procedures the flight attendants have learned
to shorten.
   ``What they're doing is not against regulations,'' said Jeff
Musto, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 2747. ``It's just following
the rules.''
   The flight attendants, who are working without a contract,
threatened to strike at 11:01 p.m. last Friday, but no job actions
have been taken against the company, said William Wren, a Northwest
spokesman.
   Talks broke off at dawn Saturday, and no further negotiations
were scheduled, spokesmen for both sides said.
   Terry Erskine, Northwest's vice president for law and labor
relations, said Monday an unusually high number of flight
attendants called in sick over the weekend. But he attributed the
absences to attendants' fears they would be stranded by a strike,
not to orders from the union.
   ``We're winding down operations here today, letting the dust
settle for the time being,'' said Musto. ``There's still a
possibility of a strike and we're free to strike at any time,''
Musto added.
   The main stumbling block to a new contract is a company proposal
to delay the promotion of B-scale workers to the higher-paid
A-scale bracket, Musto and Wren said.
   All Northwest flight attendants were paid under one scale before
a 1982 contract created the B-scale, Musto said, while all
employees hired since then have started as B-scale employees at
rates of pay lower than the old system.
   The 1982 contract called for B-scale employees to jump to
A-scale levels in their sixth year of employment, but the current
company proposal would extend that wait until the ninth year of
employment, Musto said.
   Such an extension would mean a loss off $16,776 over the three
years for the average B-scale flight attendant, Musto said.

<HEAD>System to `Inoculate' Against Computer `Viruses' Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey company is offering to ``inoculate''
computers against ``viruses,'' or rogue programs that are designed
to spread from computer to computer and damage data the computers
store.
   The Viralarm system was announced Tuesday by officials of
Lasertrieve Inc. of Metuchen, N.J., during a Microsoft Corp.
conference on a data-storage device known as CD-ROM, short for
compact disk, read-only memory.
   A statement issued by Lasertrieve said that although the newer
CD-ROM disks are impervious to corruption because information on
them cannot be altered, many computer users are concerned about
protecting programs on hard disks or on conventional floppy
diskettes.
   Viruses are creating a growing fear among computer owners and
users. Authorities in Israel recently announced the detection of a
virus that, if left to spread unchecked, could have wiped out
memory banks and disabled computers throughout the country on a
given date.
   Previous ``anti-viral'' programs only drew attention to changes,
noted the size of a program or monitored the dates of program
changes, and all were ``easily fooled by sophisticated viruses,''
the statement said.
   Viralarm consists of a special program to protect another
program, creating a software barrier.
   Before anyone can use the protected program, Viralarm checks to
determine whether the program has been altered since it was
inoculated. If there has been any change, Viralarm then blocks use
of the altered program, notifies the user and suggests a backup
copy of the program be substituted.
   The protection is available for individual personal computers
and works for most of the operating systems now available, the
Lasertrieve statement said.

^New Home Sales Plunge In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes plunged 9 percent in
January, pushing the level of sales activity to its lowest point
since the end of the last recession, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that sales dropped to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units. It was the third consecutive
monthly decline and left sales 26 percent below where they were a
year ago.
   The January decline followed decreases of 6.8 percent in
December and 3.4 percent in November as the housing industry
continued to be the sector of the economy that has been hardest hit
since the October collapse of stock prices.
   Consumers, worried about the future following the record
508-point drop in stock prices, stopped looking for new homes,
analysts believe.
   Housing is often the economic sector which turns down first
before the start of a new recession. But despite the weakness in
recent months, many economists remain hopeful that recent declines
in mortgage rates will spur a rebound in sales and construction in
the months ahead.
   If the rebound doesn't occur, then concerns about a possible
recession this year could increase.
   In another weak economic report, the government said today that
orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in
January, the first decline since a 1.4 percent drop last August.
   However, analysts said the January setback was not as weak as it
appeared because it mainly reflected a huge swing in orders for
aircraft, which had helped push factory orders up 2 percent in
December.
   The 9 percent decline in new home sales in January was the
steppest decline since a 10.9 percent drop last May. It left sales
at the lowest annual rate since December 1982, when the last
recession was ending.
   The big sales decline was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices,
with the median, or mid-point price of a home climbing 9.7 percent
to $120,000.
   The average price of a home rose to $149,000, up 10.5 percent
from December. Economists said such a big price surge is not
uncommon during a period of falling sales because fewer, but
higher-priced homes skew the averages.
   The sales decline was led by a 24.4 percent drop in sales in the
South. Sales were down 13.7 percent in the Midwest. Sales actually
rose 23 percent in the Northeast, a rebound from a 52.9 percent
drop the month before. Sales were up 0.6 percent in the West.

<TEXT>
   January new-home sales hit the lowest point since the last
recession and factory orders fell for the first time in four
months, the government said today in reports suggesting the economy
weakened after the October stock crash.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new homes plunged 9
percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000
units, the third straight monthly decline that left sales 26
percent below year-earlier levels.
   The report reflected a significant downturn in the housing
industry, the area of the economy believed hardest hit since the
collapse in stock prices five months ago. Analysts believe many
homebuyers stopped looking after the collapse, fearing economic
uncertainty in months ahead.
   Housing is often the economic sector that declines first before
the start of a new recession. Despite the weakness, however, many
economists remain hopeful that recent declines in mortgage rates
will spur a sales rebound.
   The Commerce Department also said orders to U.S. factories fell
0.6 percent in January, the first decline since a 1.4 percent drop
last August and another possible sign of post-crash economic
weakness.
   But some analysts said the report was misleading because it
reflected a huge swing in aircraft orders, which helped push
factory orders up 2 percent in December.
   Discounting the aircraft element, factory orders would have
risen 0.8 percent in January, reflecting a higher demand for
American manufactured goods caused partly by the weaker dollar,
which makes them more affordable abroad.
   The reports today appeared to have no dampening effect on
domestic financial markets, where early stock and bond prices rose.
   On Tuesday, the markets wandered aimlessly after the release of
other economic statistics that gave no clear signals.
   The Commerce Department said its chief barometer of future
economic activity fell in January, although an upward revision of
December's figure eased fears that the nation was headed for a
recession.
   The department also said construction spending fell an
unexpected 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10
months, evidence of weakness in all sectors of the building
industry.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1.16 points
to 2,070.46, slipping from the post-Oct. 19 market crash high it
had reached on Monday. It was equally quiet in the credit markets,
with the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond edging up
to 8.35 percent from Monday's 8.34 percent.
   The dollar was narrowly mixed in foreign exchange.

<HEAD>Lawmakers In Muddle Over Tax Status of Frogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is a frog livestock? People wouldn't leap to that
conclusion, a farmer-lawmaker suggested Wednesday, arguing that
frog farmers need tax protection.
   Farms for frogs should be exempt from local property taxes, just
as are any premises used for any ``livestock,'' Conservative
Michael Colvin told a House of Commons committee studying a local
finance bill.
   According to the bill, livestock is defined as ``any mammal or
bird kept for the production of food or wool, or for the purpose of
its use in the farming of land.'' All other farm premises are also
exempt from the taxes.
   Fine, but where does the frog, an amphibian, fit in? asked
Colvin, who said his acquaintance with a frog farmer prompted him
to raise the point.
   ``The definition of livestock is most unclear. Times have
changed in agriculture,'' he said, suggesting that the bill
substitute ``creatures'' for ``livestock.''
   ``It would be a sad day if any government started imposing a tax
on frogs,'' said Colvin.
   Local Government Minister Michael Howard pointed out that words
aren't everything under law. After all, he said, ``snails are
covered by the exemption for fish farms.''

   Customers who pay hundreds of dollars on
fine china expect perfect curlicues, flawless border lines and
unblemished garlands.
   Perfection can be achieved electronically on a computer screen,
but that's not good enough for the designers at Lenox.
   In an era in which computers influence the shape of cars, lay
out balanced newspaper pages and even make a superstar out of Max
Headroom, Lenox still has old-fashioned ideas about its designs.
   Every line, squiggle or tiny dot in the prototype design is
laboriously drawn by hand after weeks of research.
   ``We start with a strategist ... who analyzes the marketplace,''
said Thomas R. McInerney, Lenox's vice president of marketing.
   Some recent new designs, for instance, have been focused toward
young cosmopolitan consumers ``who are less traditional, a bit more
urban,'' he said.
   ``Once a direction has been established, we draw up a design
brief ... and the design department then takes that direction.''
   At Lenox, a design team of 17 people sits down to brainstorm.
Eventually it comes down to a designer at a drawing board, a blank
circle waiting to be embellished.
   Lenox will not reveal the names of its designers, ``for
competitive reasons,'' said Lenox spokesman Peter Cheyney.
   But the director of the design department explains some facts,
such as a source of inspiration.
   ``We have a large library with books on architectural style,
furnishings, fabrics,'' he said. ``We have color services who are
constantly bringing us up to date with predictions for this
season's hot colors.''
   Computers, he said. ``are not for us here. A computer could be
used to help with color separations or to work out the permutations
of design, but it's more of a graphic tool.''
   Lenox designs ``are done all by hand,'' the design director
said. ``In some instances, a computer can help with key outlines,
but it really comes down to the eye. ... A computer will never
substitute for a person here.''
   Every few weeks, the design team produces 30 to 60 patterns that
are test-marketed. Of that group, about six are selected for
production.
   The design team works closely with Lenox's sculptors to ensure
that the design will fit on a plate.
   ``The design is also checked with the factory to see if we're
doing something manufacturable,'' the design director said.
   Lenox China is a division of Lenox Inc., which is a subsidiary
of the Brown-Forman Corp. of Louisville, Ky. Sales figures for
Lenox china products are included in the company's overall ``home
furnishings'' report, which also comprises Lenox crystal products,
figurines and specialty products, not all of which are produced in
the United States.
   The home furnishings category listed 1987 sales of $194.2
million, compared to $173.9 million in 1986.
   In a year, Lenox will introduce about 60 new patterns. Once a
design is approved, it moves to Lenox's massive factory about 10
miles outside of Atlantic City where it is printed on decals and
applied by hand.
   The assembly line for the decal application process consists of
all women who make small talk as they work.
   ``For some reason, guys don't like to do this tedious work,''
said Dorothy Hickey. In her 33 years with Lenox, she has risen to a
spot of such seniority that she is entrusted with decorating First
Lady Nancy Reagan's presidential china and giftware.
   On a wet plate that already has been fired twice, the women
center the designs and smooth out air bubbles.
   ``Sometimes it still has a tendency to slide, especially on the
curvature of the plate,'' said Anna Pinkney, carefully positioning
tiny flowers scattered across the china.
   Several feet away, the process of applying gold and platinum
borders is so exacting that workers are allowed to get up and
stretch frequently.
   ``It requires steady hands and steady nerves,'' said a 23-year
Lenox veteran, Henry Wise, as he spun a wheel to draw the gold off
the brush and onto the china.
   Mrs. Hickey is especially proud of Lenox's design selections.
She keeps volumes of every design that Lenox has produced, from the
popular ``Autumn'' pattern that features tiny hand-painted fruits
to the more current presidential line _ Monroe, Buchanan and
McKinley.
   After seeing hundreds of patterns, Mrs. Hickey laughs when asked
if she has a favorite.
   ``Do you want to know what I picked for my own china? I have the
plain Solitaire,'' she said. ``I just couldn't make up my mind what
I wanted.''

<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. says it has sold $1.1
billion of 10-year notes, making it the largest investment-grade
corporate debt issue in the United States.
   The previous record was held by Occidental Petroleum Co., which
issued $1 billion worth of investment-grade debentures two years
ago, according to Morgan Stanley & Co., Kodak's underwriters.
   Kodak said it had planned to sell $750 million worth of bonds,
but demand was so great the amount was increased to the record
level.
   The 10-year bonds were priced at par and carry an interest rate
of 9.125 percent. The issue will be used to either retire about $1
billion of short-term loans or help finance the company's recent
$5.1 billion acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc., Kodak said.
   Kodak has traditionally tried to stay out of the credit markets.
   In 1981 the company had borrowed less than $100 million, but its
current debt totals $3.3 billion, with much of that increase coming
in the last two years.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the slightly stronger dollar
gave a weaker tone to the entire market.
   Soybeans also retreated on new estimates for large soybean
harvests in South America, while wheat came under pressure from the
Agriculture Department's revised auction program designed to lower
surplus stocks.
   The USDA held the first of three weekly auctions Tuesday.
Auctions also are scheduled for this afternoon and Friday.
   The USDA's announcement Tuesday that the Soviet Union had
completed all of its outstanding purchases of U.S. wheat weighed on
wheat futures prices, said Richard Loewy, an analyst in New York
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``In corn, there was some farmer selling overnight, but it's
mainly just being influenced by the other grains,'' Loewy said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.09{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1 cent lower with March at $2.03\ a bushel; oats were unchanged
to } cent higher with March at $1.94 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
to 2} cents lower with March at $6.33 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent higher with April at 72.05
cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with
March at 80.40 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with April at 43.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.23 cent to .40 cent higher with March at 52 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Tuesday except for
frozen pork bellies, which ended lower.

   The stock market gained ground today, resuming
its recent rally after a pause on Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 1.16 points
Tuesday, rose 13.09 to 2,083.55 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 880 up, 479 down and
465 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market was still benefiting from spreading
confidence that a recession can be avoided despite the market's
crash last autumn.
   One theoretical warning signal of a business slump was lifted
Tuesday, when the Commerce Department issued new figures on its
index of leading economic indicators.
   With an upward revision of the December figure for the index
from a decline to a gain, it no longer showed a string of three
consecutive lower readings.
   Brokers also noted that enthusiasm for stocks has been buoyed by
a brisk pace of takeover activity.
   J.P. Stevens rose 1\ to 55}. West Point-Pepperell made a bid of
$56 a share for the company Tuesday, in competition with a
management-led group that is seeking to buy it out.

   Securities-industry stocks were broadly higher, buoyed by
takeover activity and the improved state of the markets. Morgan

1 to 25.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added

   Delvalle fired military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega last
Thursday but the defense chief ignored the order and rallied his
allies in the National Assembly against the president. On Friday,
the assembly voted to oust Delvalle and installed Education
Minister Manuel Solis Palma in his place.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug smuggling charges by two
Florida grand juries and has been under heavy diplomatic, economic
and political pressure by the Reagan administration to step aside
and open the way for civilian-led constitutional rule.
   Among the banks listed by Rogers which would be affected by the
order are Marine Midland NA, Irving Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co.
and the Republic National Bank. He said all have headquarters in
New York.
   ``Every dime we can find is in those banks,'' Rogers said. He
added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for
whatever payments it makes to the current Panamanian government.
   The coalition of opposition leaders believes that the Panamanian
government is facing a grave cash flow problem and is extremely
vulnerable to economic pressure from the United States.
   Unlike other countries, Panama cannot cover its cash shortages
by printing new money because the dollar is the national currency.
   Sosa said international opposition to the new government was
evident earlier this week when, he claimed, only eight ambassadors
showed up for a State of the Union address. From the Western
Hemisphere, he said, only Cuba and Nicaragua attended.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the ousted president of Panama, Eric
Arturo Delvalle, sued in federal court today to block a New York
bank from turning over millions of dollars to military strongman
Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking
the Republic National Bank of New York from transferring an
estimated $10 million.
   A hearing on the matter is slated for Monday before U.S.
District Judge Lloyd F. McMahon.
   The lawsuit, filed at federal court in Manhattan by lawyers from
Washington, seeks to establish title to the funds held in the
Republic National Bank account and ``to prevent their transfer into
the hands of a military dictatorship ... which has attempted to
seize power and overthrow the lawful authorities of the Republic of
Panama,'' according to court papers.
   Noriega, the military leader of Panama, was indicted on drug
charges by two U.S. grand juries in Florida Feb. 4.
   Devalle sought to dismiss Noriega Feb. 25, but was himself
ousted by the National Assembly the next day and has gone into
hiding.
   On Tuesday, Devalle froze all Panamanian assets outside the
country, and the United States, which still recognizes Devalle as
the legitimate head of Panama, has supported the action.

   Thousands of farmers wrestling with massive
debts or being forced out of business may get another chance under
new loan rules being drawn up by the federal Farmers Home
Administration, the Agriculture Department agency said today.
   Joe O'Neill, an FmHA spokesman, said the new rules probably will
be ready by June. In many cases, over-burdened borrowers could have
much of their debt written off, trimmed back to reflect their
assets in hopes of keeping them in business.
   However, O'Neill said he had no estimate of how much debt the
FmHA might write off under the new rules.
   ``There's just no way of knowing,'' O'Neill said. ``It'll be
each individual case all the way through.''
   At the end of last fiscal year on Sept. 30, he said, 261,291
FmHA borrowers owed the agency about $26 billion. Of that, 127,671
were delinquent, owing $6.6 billion, including principal and
interest.
   New rules governing how the agency deals with farmers who owe it
money could help prevent 100,000 farms from going under, The New
York Times reported today, quoting FmHA officials in Washington.
Agency officials also said thousands of farmers who went bankrupt
over the past 10 years could find themselves back in operation.
   The new rules are a result of a bill passed by Congress in
December calling on the FmHA, an agency that serves as a ``lender
of last resort'' for the nation's farmers, to go easier on farmers
who are behind in their payments.
   The new law requires the agency to do whatever possible to
restructure loans in order to keep FmHA borrowers in business.
   ``Our attitude is going to be different,'' said FmHA
Administrator Vance L. Clark. ``We want to make the new act work,
and we're going to have a lot of room to maneuver to restructure
these loans.''
   Lynn Hayes, an attorney with the Farmers Legal Action Group in
St. Paul, Minn., said, ``I'm thrilled they are apparently taking
this legislation seriously and are trying to make it work.''
   The new regulations would enable debt-burdened farmers to stay
in business through a number of loan restructuring options.
According to agency officials, farmers would be offered the
opportunity to pay off loans at a lower rate of interest over a
longer period of time.
   As a last resort, the agency could write off debts in excess of
a borrower's assets, O'Neill said. For example, if a farmer's
assets were $150,000 and debts totaled $500,000, the write-off
could be as much as $350,000 if the FmHA determined the farmer
could handle the remainder by staying in business.
   ``It makes sense, then, to keep that person in business and
write off the difference between what they owe and their assets _
if the government stands a chance of retrieving more by keeping
that farmer going,'' O'Neill said.

   Members of the Senate Banking Committee failed
to unravel a tangled three-way dispute this morning that has
blocked legislation to repeal the Depression-era law separating
commercial banking and the securities industry.
   Committee members, after meeting more than two hours behind
closed doors on Tuesday, struck a tentative deal that balanced the
interests of banks, securities firms and insurance companies,
according to Senate aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. But
the agreement fell apart almost immediately.
   The compromise would have given bank holding companies more
securities powers, but restricted their ability to expand into
insurance, the aides said. However, it fell apart when senators on
opposite sides of the insurance issue realized they had a different
understanding of the agreement, the aides said.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., the committee chairman, called
another negotiating session for later in the day. An aide said the
nature of the restriction on banks' ability to enter the insurance
business remained the sticking point in the talks.
   Legislation sponsored by Proxmire and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah,
the committee's senior Republican, would repeal the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act, which forbids commercial banks from
underwriting and selling most securities. It was passed in the wake
of the 1929 stock market crash to preserve the safety of the
banking system.
   Affiliates of bank holding companies would be allowed
immediately to begin underwriting mortgage-backed securities,
commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by
consumer loans.
   Power to underwrite corporate debt would be postponed until Jan.
1 and corporate stock underwriting by bank affiliates would begin
in 1990.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the securities
subcommittee, was advocating more restrictive legislation that
would have required separate congressional votes in 1989, 1990 and
1991 before bank affiliates could underwrite corporate bonds,
stocks and mutual funds.
   The tentative compromise, according to the aides, would have
automatically phased in power over corporate bonds and mutual funds
and required a separate vote in the future only on stock
underwriting.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, where
insurance companies are important employers, was pushing an
amendment that would prohibit state-chartered banks owned by
holding companies from further expansion into insurance.
   Opposition from banks to Dodd's amendment, if passed, could kill
the entire bill, aides said, but some senators were reluctant to
vote against the amendment for fear of retaliation from insurance
interests within their states.
   One version of the compromise on insurance, as described by the
aides, would have allowed a state to permit its banks to underwrite
insurance within the state even if the holding company that owned
the bank was headquartered out of state. However, banks would not
be allowed to locate in a state with permissive laws and then
``export'' insurance to other states.
   A second, more restrictive, version of the compromise would
require both the bank and its parent company to be located within a
state before state officials could allow the bank to underwrite
insurance.
   Proxmire and Garn opened the all-day session Tuesday with a plea
to fellow senators to ignore pressure from special interest
lobbyists.
   ``We are not here to merely broker a compromise between the
various providers of financial services,'' Proxmire said.
   Garn, looking at a hearing room packed with lobbyists, said,
``It's time to forget all of you and your special interests and
your greed.''
   The Proxmire-Garn bill has been endorsed by the heads of all the
relevant regulatory agencies and by President Reagan, but it faces
substantial hurdles even beyond the Senate committee before it can
be enacted.
   Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
who will have jurisdiction over the issue in the House, have
expressed considerable reluctance about broadening bank powers too
much.

   General Motors Corp. has fired several
employees and disciplined others for accepting gifts from a major
tooling supplier in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a trade
publication has reported.
   This week's edition of Metalworking News identified Lamb
Technicon Corp. of Warren as the subject of a GM investigation.
   GM disciplined employees who helped make decisions concerning
tooling purchases and who accepted gifts from Lamb Technicon,
Metalworking News said. Gifts included paid trips with Lamb
Technicon salesmen to resort areas or hotels.
   Darlene Sandlin, a spokeswoman for Lamb Technicon, confirmed the
company had been investigated by GM. She said the company issued
new guidelines on ethics in 1984.
   GM officials, citing a policy against discussing individual
personnel matters, refused comment.
   Technicon recently was selected as a major tooling supplier for
GM's Saturn Corp. car project in Tennessee.

Corp., whose officials said the situation subsequently appeared to
be stabilizing.
   The bank held average total deposits of $6.87 billion during the
seven-day period ended Feb. 24, down 8.7 percent from $7.47 billion
the previous week and down $1.5 billion from the period including
Dec. 31, 1987.
   Gerald Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive of First
Republic, said the one-week outflow of deposits at the Dallas bank
was ``unusual,'' but added that the bank's funding situation
``appeared to be stabilizing.''
   During the week covered in the report by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Dallas, the bank holding company was the subject of
published reports that takeover or bailout negotiations were under
way, and that its lead institution had suffered deposit outflows.
   A 55-member team supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency began auditing First RepublicBank, which lost $656.8
million in 1987 and finished the year with $3.92 billion worth of
problem assets. Bank officials later denied that the negotiations
were taking place.
   Fronterhouse said the Dallas bank's recent deposit loss
``reflects mainly the impact of earlier false rumors and extensive
adverse publicity.
   ``By the middle of last week, the sources of funds for the
Dallas bank and for the corporation as a whole appeared to be
stabilizing,'' Fronterhouse said.

   The dollar strengthened against most major
currencies Wednesday. Gold prices stagnated or rose slightly.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar firmed on two rumors:
that the U.S. administration would allow the dollar to rise if
American trade figures continue to improve and that the Soviet
Union was buying dollars.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound when the
state-run Bank of England sold an undetermined amount of pounds to
keep the currency below 3.0 West German marks as the mark fell
against the dollar.
   At the end of the day, one pound cost $1.7680, cheaper than
$1.7775 late Tuesday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with late
Tuesday rates included: 1.6945 West German marks, up from 1.6855;
1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3915; 5.7345 French francs, up from
5.7065; 1.9013 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8940; 1,247 Italian lire,
up from 1,244.35; 1.2558 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2570.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 128.47 Japanese yen, up
from 128.30 Tuesday. In London the dollar traded at 129.27 yen.
   Gold bullion was higher in London at $429.50 a troy ounce, up
from $428.70 late Tuesday. It was unchanged in Zurich at $429.50.
   Traders said gold prices appeared to be stabilizing in a range
of $425 to $433.
   Gold in Hong Kong traded at $433.96, up marginally from $433.80
Tuesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.24 a troy ounce, down
from $6.29.

<HEAD>U.S. Manufacturers Seek More Use of American Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers of American auto parts are
huddling with executives of 11 Japanese car companies in an effort
to whittle away at a $6 billion trade deficit between the two
countries in the auto parts industry.
   Executives of the New Jersey-based Motor and Equipment
Manufacturers Association say the current meetings are
unprecedented, and offer an opportunity to cut the massive trade
deficit between the two countries.
   The meetings are being held Wednesday and Thursday between
members of the U.S. group and purchasing agents of companies
belonging to the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association.
   The meetings are aimed at putting more American-made replacement
parts under the hoods of Japanese cars, according to William A.
Raftery, president of the auto parts organization.
   ``We believe the Japanese recognize the seriousness of the
situation and are prepared to do something about it,'' Raftery said
between meetings Wednesday.
   Japanese auto parts companies are shipping $5 billion a year in
parts to the United States, Raftery said. Some of the parts go to
U.S. car companies, others are destined for Japanese cars that are
sold in the United States, or to Japanese companies producing cars
in the United States.
   ``The Japanese are buying more U.S. auto parts now that they are
setting up factories here, but they are not purchasing nearly
enough U.S. parts,'' Raftery said. ``The problem is that the
Japanese have been encouraging Japanese suppliers to follow them to
the U.S. and open plants here. That doesn't provide new jobs, and
it takes away U.S. jobs.
   ``When a foreign manufacturer opens a plant in the United
States, whether the company is Japanese, German or whatever, they
hire far fewer people than a similar American company,'' Raftery
said.
   When a foreign company builds a plant in the United States, they
import more of their parts and tend to be in the assembly business
rather than the manufacturing business, he said.
   If the Japanese are going to sell their cars in the United
States and take advantage of the new car market in America, ``they
should give the U.S. manufacturer the opportunity to provide parts
for some of those vehicles, as long as we're price competitive,''
he said.
   Only a very small percentage of Japanese cars use American-made
parts while ``U.S. companies are using Japanese parts, Korean parts
and Taiwanese parts,'' he said.
   The Japanese are buying ``a few hundred million dollars'' in
auto parts from U.S. companies while exporting billions of dollars
in their own auto parts to America, he said.
   He said the Japanese association is cooperating fully ``and has
been extremely helpful in bringing these negotiations about.''

<HEAD>Troubled Running Gear Firm, Licking Wounds, Settles in Montana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a darling of the running-gear boom,
Moss Brown & Co. stumbled on its way to becoming a $100
million-a-year business in the nation's capital.
   Now, its founder is starting over in a storefront 80 miles
northwest of Yellowstone National Park.
   The grain elevators and muddy pickup trucks in this tiny farming
community are a far cry from the pricey Georgetown section of
Washington, D.C., where Henry Barksdale's Moss Brown & Co. built a
reputation as a rising star of the running and outdoor clothing
mail-order business.
   In the heady days of 1984, Barksdale was pictured on the cover
of the Washington Post Magazine and Moss Brown was named to Inc.
magazine's list of the 500 fastest growing companies in America.
   But Barksdale's boom went bust in Washington _ the victim, some
said, of trying to run too fast _ and after working through a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court reorganization, his enterprise has
emerged with a new name and a relatively clean slate.
   ``As far as I know of, everyone has been taken care of,''
Barksdale says of the customers who filed claims against Moss Brown
for undelivered merchandise.
   Barksdale's new firm, appropriately called Runwest Inc., has
acquired the Moss Brown trademark, but the company is a much
smaller and perhaps less ambitious version of the original.
   Back in Washington, Barksdale thought nothing of firing off 12
million catalogs and churning out Gore-Tex running suits by the
tens of thousands.
   Today, in Belgrade, employees take a more leisurely pace,
quietly stuffing garments into mailing envelopes by hand while
listening to music on a radio.
   ``I feel really welcome here,'' the 59-year-old Barksdale told
the Bozeman (Mont.) Daily Chronicle in a recent interview.
``Everybody is so open. It's sort of like when I was a kid growing
up in St. Louis. I'd forgotten that people were really like that.''
   While describing banks in Washington as ``basically just
computers,'' Barksdale says the vice president of Valley Bank of
Belgrade walked over and introduced himself the day Barksdale moved
in.
   ``That's a different experience than you'd have back in D.C.,''
he said.
   With $8 million in sales in 1984, Moss Brown was being hailed as
the L.L. Bean of the running set.
   ``If we were doing $15 million a year in sales, I'd probably
still be there,'' Barksdale said. ``But I'm not sure I'd be happy.''
   What happened to him in Washington is a classic case of reaching
too far too fast.
   ``We made good money until 1983,'' when Moss Brown earned
$200,000 in profits, Barksdale said. ``Then I decided to turn it
into a big company.''
   From mailing orders in the back of his Georgetown retail store,
Barksdale moved the mail-order business into a 40,000-square-foot
warehouse in suburban Alexandria, Va. And he expanded the mailing
list, achieving those 10 million to 12 million mailings a year, by
purchasing or renting costly mailing lists from other firms.
   These expansion moves added huge costs to the business without
adding enough revenues to pay for them _ at a time when the running
boom was beginning to fade.
   ``We added customers faster than we were able to generate
merchandise,'' Barksdale admits.
   Don Chilcutt of Direct Media, an Edmond, Okla., broker of
mailing lists for mail-order companies, agrees with that sober
assessment.
   Barksdale was ``prospecting'' for new customers by leasing or
buying millions of new names to add to his mailing list, Chilcutt
said, but his known buyers couldn't support the expansion.
   ``You can't support a 10 million mailing with only 123,000
customers,'' Chilcutt said.
   Last March, Moss Brown filed for bankruptcy protection, having
piled up $2.15 million in debts, $1.7 million of it unsecured.
   Mark Holmstrup, an investigator at the City of Alexandria's
office of consumer affairs, says his office received some 150
complaints from customers of Moss Brown, most coming at the end of
1986 and in early 1987.
   Customers complained Moss Brown never sent the merchandise they
ordered, even though the company billed customers' credit cards or
cashed customers' checks, Holmstrup says.
   After mailing new catalogs to customers and offering credits to
those who filed complaints, Barksdale contends his debts have been
settled. And he says he gets letters daily from people saying they
are glad he's back in business.
   But this time, Barksdale says he'll be satisfied with being
small in beautiful Montana. Asked about his goal for the fledgling,
reorganized company, he says he'd like to see sales of $1 million a
year by 1989.
   ``I don't want to get that big anymore,'' he said. ``We made a
lot of money and had a lot of fun, but my wife would kill me if I
make the business even as big as $5 million again.''

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points
earlier in the session, was unchanged at 2,070.46 by 3 p.m. on Wall

   One theoretical warning signal of a business slump was lifted

   With an upward revision of the December figure for the index

   J.P. Stevens rose 1~ to 56]. West Point-Pepperell made a bid of
$56 a share for the company Tuesday, in competition with a
management-led group that is seeking to buy it out.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.31 to 150.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.49 at 290.40.

   Grain and soybean futures closed lower Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade after an attempt to rally the market
failed.
   C&D Commodities, a large investment fund, was a heavy buyer of
soybean meal and soybean oil futures but the action attracted
little buying interest among other traders, analysts said.
   ``The market didn't respond, so we started to sell off and the
thing snowballed late in the day,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``We ended up near or at the
day's lows across the board.''
   Wheat also came under pressure from the Agriculture Department's
revised auction program designed to lower surplus stocks.
   The USDA announced after the close it had sold 10 million
bushels of wheat, the amount it had expected to sell, on Tuesday.
Auctions also were scheduled for Wednesday and Friday, and three
more are set for next week.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents to 4{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.06} a bushel; corn was 2 cents

<HEAD>Bookout Retiring as Shell Oil President, CEO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John F. Bookout, who has served as president and
chief executive officer of Shell Oil Co. since 1976, announced
Wednesday he is retiring effective June 30.
   Frank H. Richardson, executive vice president of products, will
be nominated to the Shell Oil board of directors to succeed
Bookout, the company said.
   Shell is wholly owned by the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of
Companies, which is based in both London and the Hague, the
Netherlands.
   Bookout joined the Houston-based Shell Oil as a geologist in
Tulsa, Okla., in 1950. He was elected president of Shell Canada
Ltd. in 1970 and returned to Shell Oil in 1974 as executive vice
president of exploration and production.
   Shell said one of Bookout's principal achievements was putting
into place 10 years ago a strategic planning that served the
company well during the volatile conditions the oil industry has
experienced.
   Normal retirement for Shell's senior management is at 60, but
Bookout, 65, was given two formal extensions, Shell spokeswoman
Kitty Borah said.
   Bookout has not announced any future plans, she said. He was out
of town on business and could not be reached for comment.
   Shell also announced Wednesday that Charles W. Wilson will
replace Richardson as executive vice president of products
effective May 1. He previously was vice president of refining and
marketing.
   Richardson spent the first part of his Shell Oil career in the
exploration and production organization. He became vice president
of corporate planning in 1978, executive vice president of
administration in 1982 and assumed his present position in 1983.
   Wilson joined Shell Oil in 1963, becoming vice president of
production in 1964 then moved to Shell Western E&P Inc. as
president in 1987. He returned to Shell Oil in his present position
late last year.

<HEAD>Sears Announces Overhaul of Merchandising Sector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck & Co. said Wednesday it was
beginning a three-year overhaul of its flagship merchandise group
to make each segment of its retail business more competitive.
   The restructuring, which will trim an as-yet undertermined
number of people from the merchandise group's management, will make
Sears stores more responsive to customer needs and wants, officials
said.
   ``The apparel business will be run differently from the hardware
business,'' said spokesman Philo Holland. ``You need different
organizational structures to compete in different businesses.''
   Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of the
merchandising group, said in a statement that the restructuring
would reduce the number of management levels, making each segment
of Sears' merchandise business leaner and more independent.
   ``We are competing in many diverse businesses, each with its own
unique structure, and (we) have been essentially using one
organizational format to compete in all of these businesses,''
Bozic said.
   ``The changes we make will result in a company that is better
structured to maintain its position as America's premier retailer.''
   Officials said they had no estimate of the number of employees
to be affected or the cost savings involved, because they were only
beginning the restructuring procss.
   ``The ultimate size and structure will be determined by how we
choose to compete in the different businesses we are
restructuring,'' Holland said.
   He said the reduction in management personnel would be achieved
through attrition and a severance offer of two weeks' salary for
each year of service, up to a maximum of 52 weeks.
   Employees at least 50 years old who have been with the company
at least 10 years will also be offered early retirement benefits,
Holland said.
   The reorganization is widely seen as an attempt to revive
sluggish sales and profits within the merchandise group, which
accounts for nearly 60 percent of the company's revenues.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points at

   The Dow Jones industrials have essentially gone nowhere in the
past two days after taking a 48-point jump on Monday.
   But as has been the case for the past couple of months, broader
market measures were generally strong Wednesday, reflecting
continuing interest in many depressed secondary issues.
   Analysts said the market was still benefiting from spreading
confidence that a recession can be avoided despite the market's
crash last autumn.
   One theoretical warning of a business slump was lifted Tuesday,
when the Commerce Department issued new figures on its index of
leading economic indicators. With an upward revision of the
December figure for the index from a decline to a gain, it no

   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, asserted
that recent declines in the index don't portend an impending
recession.
   Brokers also noted that enthusiasm for stocks has been buoyed by
a brisk pace of takeover activity.
   But with all that, they said, many investors still seemed leery
of chasing after an advance that has carried the market to its

   Geico jumped 17 to 121. The company said it will hold a
so-called Dutch auction tender offer for 1 million of its shares,
to be purchased at a price of between $115 and $125 apiece, and
also raised its quarterly dividend.
   Xerox gained 2} to 61} amid a variety of rumors. The company
said it had no explanation for the unusual activity in its stock.
   Japanese issues moved up following a strong day in the Tokyo
market. Kubota Ltd. rose 7 to 99{; Matsushita 4| to 187[, and Honda
Motor 3\ to 122.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.28 billion, or
0.39 percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter

   Bond prices rose modestly in light trading
Wednesday, as the government provided more evidence of economic
sluggishness.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose ] point, or about $3.75 for
every $1,000 in face value, as its yield slipped to 8.31 percent
from 8.35 percent late Tuesday.
   Trading has been very light this week, and analysts ascribe that
to consternation about whether the economy is headed into a
recession or simply slowing down.
   William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the bond market was ``marking time''
until Friday's scheduled release of February employment figures.
   The employment figures are usually the first economic statistics
released for any given month and they provide the most recent
evidence available on general economic activity.
   Sullivan said one factor contributing to the mild bond price
rise on Wednesday was a new Commerce Department report that said
sales of new homes fell 9 percent in January.
   ``The report showed surprising weakness for the third month in
row,'' Sullivan said.
   A slow-growing economy is generally viewed positively by bond
traders because it usually means credit demand will be weak,
allowing room for interest rates to fall.
   In another report, the government said orders to U.S. factories
for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January, the first
decline since August.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 2-32 point, intermediate maturities rose \ point
and 20-year issues rose 11-32 point, the financial information
service Telerate Inc. reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.14 to 113.93. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.82
to 1,192.20.
   Among corporate bonds, industrials and utilities rose [ point in
light trading, the investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc. said.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.42 to 286.13.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 2 basis points to 5.60
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 6 basis points to 5.85 percent and year bills
fell 2 basis points to 6.16 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6{ percent, down from 6| percent late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Gold Mixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened in foreign exchange
trading Wednesday, especially against the Japanese yen, partly
because of a rumor that the Reagan administration would tolerate a
higher value for the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices were narrowly mixed. As of 4 p.m. EST, Republic
National Bank of New York quoted bullion at $430.25 a troy ounce,
down 20 cents from the price quoted late Tuesday.
   Dealers attributed much of the dollar's strength to a rumor that
an unidentified senior U.S. official had told Japanese reporters
the United States would allow the dollar to move higher following
its protracted decline.
   Although this story was denied later, many traders scrambled to
buy the U.S. currency, causing it to rise in the most active
trading of the week against most key currencies except the Canadian
dollar.
   ``It was a bit more energetic today,'' said Albert Soria, vice
president and foreign exchange manager of the Swiss Bank Corp.'s
New York branch.
   Nevertheless, he said the relatively narrow trading ranges for
the dollar vs. other currencies that have emerged recently would
persist for awhile. ``I don't see any breakout one way or the
other,'' Soria said.
   Many foreign-exchange dealers were focusing on the release later
this month of U.S. foreign trade figures for January to gain more
insight into how to structure their trading strategies.
   If those figures provide more evidence of a declining deficit,
as shown by statistics of the previous two months, a moderate rally
in the dollar would likely result.
   If the January deficit widens, dealers probably would sell
dollars on the theory that the currency will depreciate further in
value to stimulate American exports.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.47 Japanese yen, up from
128.30 Tuesday. In London the dollar traded at 129.27 yen. By the
time trading concluded in New York, the dollar was worth 129.40
yen, more than 1 yen higher than 128.32 yen rate quoted late
Tuesday.
   In London, the pound cost $1.7680, cheaper than $1.7775 late
Tuesday. Later in New York the pound was worth $1.7673, cheaper
than $1.7766 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday
included: 1.6969 West German marks, up from 1.6864; 1.4030 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3916; 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2578;
5.7385 French francs, up from 5.7100; 1,248.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,243.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe vs. late Tuesday included:
1.6945 West German marks, up from 1.6855; 1.4005 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3915; 5.7345 French francs, up from 5.7065; 1.9013 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8940; 1,247 Italian lire, up from 1,244.35;
1.2558 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2570.
   Gold bullion rose in London to $429.50 a troy ounce vs. $428.70
late Tuesday. It was unchanged in Zurich at $429.50. In Hong Kong
gold traded at $433.96 vs. $433.80.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell 20 cents a troy ounce to $430.80.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.24 a troy ounce, down
from $6.29. On the New York Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery traded at $6.21 cents an ounce, off about 1 cent.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Continue To Slide On Surplus Production Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices set new life-of-contract lows for the
fourth consecutive day Wednesday on fears that the International
Cocoa Organization will be unable to control the effects of
steadily rising production.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures retreated; livestock
and meat were mixed; precious metals were slightly lower; energy
futures were mostly lower; and stock-index futures advanced.
   No news from the International Cocoa Organization's week-long
meeting in London was perceived as bad news on New York's Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, where prices for future delivery of cocoa
settled as much as $35 a ton below Tuesday's final prices.
   ``The market continues to try and absorb prospects for surplus
production,'' said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in New York for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``It's falling pretty sharply.''
   Cocoa producer and consumer nations are meeting to discuss
withholding cocoa from the market to support prices, Ms. Kaul said.
   ICCO buffer-stock buying, a price-support mechanism that was
resumed in January after a six-month suspension, has already
exhausted the allocation of 250,000 metric tons for the 1987-88
marketing year, she said.
   World cocoa production has risen steadily since 1986 and is
expected to total more than 2 million metric tons this year.
   Cocoa settled $31 to $35 lower with the contract for delivery in
March at $1,563 a metric ton.
   Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade after an attempt to rally the soybean market failed, analysts
said.
   Wheat came under additional pressure from the Agriculture
Department's revised auction program designed to lower surplus
stocks.
   The USDA announced after the close it had sold 10 million
bushels of wheat, the agency's targeted amount, on Tuesday.
Auctions also were scheduled for Wednesday and Friday, and three
more are set for next week.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 4{ cents lower with March at $3.06{ a
bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2} cents lower with March at $2.02 a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1\ cents lower with March at $1.93{ a
bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 5} cents lower with March at
$6.30{ a bushel.
   Live cattle futures settled higher while feeder cattle prices
moved lower in choppy trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures have traded within a narrow range for more than a
month.
   Hog futures finished slightly lower in light, technically based
trading. Frozen pork bellies advanced on expectations that discount
pricing at the wholesale level would encourage sales of pork
products.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .38 cent higher with April at 72.12
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent lower with
March at 80.27 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .22 cent lower
with April at 43.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .23
cent to .67 cent higher with March at 52.27 cents a pound.
   Gold futures have encountered support at around $430 a troy
ounce for the April contract, which settled slightly above that
level on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 20 cents lower with April at $432.20 a
troy ounce; silver was .50 cent to 1 cent lower with March at
$6.216 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices finished mostly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after struggling back from a sharp selloff
earlier in the day.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .12 cent lower to .13
cent higher with April at $15.67 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
lower to .46 cent higher with April at 43.93 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .39 cent lower with April at
44.90 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures settled slightly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index ended .70 point higher at 268.35. The
underlying spot index finished .75 point higher at 267.98.

<HEAD>Troubled Florida Company Buys Stalled Dunes Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financially troubled Dunes Casino
Hotel project here has been sold to a Florida company with its own
troubled history of lawsuits, cash shortages and federal
investigations, federal documents show.
   The Royale Group Ltd., a company in the hotel and real estate
business, recently bought out nearly all the stock in the Dunes,
according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and reviewed by The Press
of Atlantic City.
   The Dunes project at the southern end of the Boardwalk stalled
in 1979 when the owners ran out of money. Its bare steel girders
have stood rusting ever since.
   Developer Jack Bona arrived in 1983 to rescue the casino but was
forced to file for bankruptcy protection in August 1985.
   Since then, Bona has tried several other plans to raise money to
pay off his debts, including a sale of shares and private deals
with investors. All have failed.
   Royale's chief executive officer since 1981 has been Leonard
Pelullo, a leader in the effort to restore a strip of art
deco-style hotels on Miami Beach.
   Pelullo and Bona have tried to keep the deal for the Dunes
quiet. A Royale Group Ltd. vice president refers all questions
about the sale to company attorneys, who say they cannot provide
details.
   So far, no one in Royale has said anything about how the company
plans to raise the approximately $250 million needed to complete
the casino hotel.
   Royale has been trying to break into the Atlantic City casino
industry for a decade. Then called Cavanaugh Communities Corp., the
company first bought marina land in 1978 but was unable to put
together financing for a casino.
   Documents obtained by The Press from the SEC and U.S. Bankruptcy
Court say that Boardwalk to Bay Inc., a Royale subsidiary, has
purchased 99 percent of the Dunes stock from Bona and has an option
to buy the other 1 percent.
   Pelullo and his companies have been involved in nearly three
dozen separate lawsuits and actions by government agencies,
according to company documents filed with the SEC. Many were filed
by banks over the alleged failure to repay millions of dollars
worth of loans, the newspaper reported.
   Pelullo's business dealings spawned a U.S. grand jury
investigation in 1986, the newspaper said. According to Royale's
SEC filings, the investigation centers on the circumstances
surrounding a $13 million mortgage granted to Royale by a
California savings and loan.

<HEAD>Atari Earnings Rise 57 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Corp. on Wednesday said its
earnings rose 57 percent to $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of
1987 and credited part of the jump to its October acquisition of
the Federated Group Inc. chain of retail electronics stores.
   Other factors contributing to the increase included strengthened
computer sales in Europe and booming video game sales in the United
States, said Greg Pratt, company spokesman.
   The fourth-quarter figure represented 32 cents a share, on
revenue of $277 million. That compared with earnings of $11.9
million, or 22 cents per share, on revenue of $92.6 million in the
same 1986 period.
   Sales of televisions, stereos, microwave ovens and other
electronics equipment at Federated's 68 stores in California,
Arizona and Texas accounted for 47 percent of revenues, or $130.6
million.
   Profits for all of 1987 rose 76 percent to $44.1 million, or 76
cents per share, from $25 million, or 53 cents in 1986.
   Sales rose 91 percent, increasing to $493 million in 1987
compared to $258 million the previous year.
   ``Video games were obviously a hot category this year,'' said
Pratt. ``There were no teddy bears or laser guns to take those
dollars away. People went back to more traditional stuff and bought
video games.''
   Federated stores now acount for 25 percent of Atari Corp., one
of the world's largest manufacturers of personal computers and
video games.

<HEAD>Home Sales, Factory Orders Down; Stocks Flat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New home sales dropped sharply and factory orders slipped in
January, according to government reports Wednesday that reflected
weakness in the economy.
   Bond prices strengthened in a typical reaction to news of a
sluggish economy. The yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond
slipped to 8.31 percent from 8.35 percent.
   On Wall Street, stocks rose marginally as the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrial stocks edged up 0.83 to 2,071.29.
   In Washington, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan took
another opportunity to calm concerns that the central bank would
respond to political pressure and ease credit too much in an
election year.
   Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee that even if the Fed
wanted to drive down interest rates sharply, ``we would fail,''
because markets would likely resist such a move and ``would run
away from us.''
   Greenspan also called for new efforts to cut the federal budget
deficit, including a 15-cent gasoline tax and measures to trim
Social Security and other entitlement programs.
   In spite of the news of sluggishness on Wednesday, stock
analysts said Wall Street was still taking courage from a report on
Tuesday by the Commerce Department on its index of leading economic
indicators.
   With an upward revision of the December figure for the index
from a decline to a gain, it no longer showed a string of three
consecutive lower readings.
   New home sales fell 9 percent in January, pushing sales activity
to its slowest pace since the end of the last recession, the
Commerce Department said Wednesday.
   A downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset
of a recession, but analysts said they believed falling mortgage
rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months.
   In a second lackluster economic report, the Commerce Department
said orders for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January to a
seasonally adjusted $212.6 billion.
   While this was the first decline in five months, analysts noted
that it followed an unusually large 2 percent December increase, a
gain which reflected a big jump in demand for jet airplanes.
   Analysts said the one-month setback did nothing to change their
view that American manufacturers are continuing to enjoy a sales
boom led by increased demand for exports.
   James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said with ``mortgage rates moving in the right
direction'' sales for all of 1988 should end up only 3 percent
below the 1987 sales pace.
   But other analysts said it remained to be seen whether the drop
in mortgage rates will be enough to attract new buyers. They noted
that sales have been strong for the past three years and a lot of
pent-up demand has been exhausted.
   ``We simply don't have the demand for housing that we had in the
first part of the rcovery,'' said Michael Sumichrast, an economist
and publisher of a construction industry newsletter. ``The South,
which accounts for almost half of all new homes sold, is still weak
and you won't see any significant improvement until that area turns
around.''
   Banks recorded their least profitable year since the Great
Depression in 1987, but a top federal regulator said Wednesday he
sees better days ahead.
   The year-to-year drop in earnings was due entirely to large
banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to
Third World countries, said L. William Seidman, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

<TEXT>
   A Commerce Department report that showed a slide in January
new-home sales provided further evidence of a housing industry
slump following the stock market crash five months ago. Last week
the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes
in January fell for the third straight month.
   Nevertheless, sales vary widely around the country, reflecting
regional economies, interest rates and demand, random AP telephone
queries of Realtors suggested. Here is a brief description of
housing markets in six areas:
   Boston: Sales were stronger in the last three months of 1987
compared with a year earlier, and preliminary figures for early
this year suggest stability. Fixed-rate mortgage rates have fallen
slightly to about 9.75 percent, while prices are up more than 6
percent above year-earlier levels.
   Dallas: Sales fell more than 30 percent in the last quarter of
1987 from the year earlier level. Prices have risen in a range of 2
percent to 8 percent. Fixed mortgage rates vary between 9 percent
and 10 percent.
   Kansas City: Sales have fallen slightly but there is no
clear-cut trend. Mortgage rates have fallen from 10.5 percent to
about 9.5 percent and prices have risen nearly 10 percent from a
year earlier.
   Southern California: Sales have fallen about 3.3 percent from a
year earlier. Fixed rate mortgages are expected to fall to 9.5
percent from 9.75 percent. Prices have risen between 1 percent and
2 percent from a year earlier.
   New York-New Jersey: Sales have slowed, and recent drops in
mortgage rates to the 10 percent level are expected to stimulate
the market. Prices have remained about the same.
   Philadelphia: Sales have improved since the start of the year
and mortgage rates have declined slightly to about 9.5 percent.
Prices have remained about the same.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules For Unions In Dues Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An evenly divided Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday that an airlines may be forced to continue to collect
union dues from workers after its contract with employees has
expired.
   The justices, by a 4-4 vote, upheld rulings that forced Trans
World Airlines to continue the dues check-off after a strike by
flight attendants in 1986.
   Such splits automatically uphold lower court rulings but set no
national precedent. The TWA case carried little impact for most
employers, anyway, because it involved an interpretation of the
Railway Labor Act, which only applies to the airlines and railroad
industries.
   Most private industry employers' labor relations are subject to
the National Labor Relations Act.
   Nonetheless, Vicki Frankovich, president of the Independent
Federation of Flight Attendants, said, ``We are extremely pleased
with this result.''
   The ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by any
indication of how each individual justice voted.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who only recently joined the court,
did not participate in the case.
   TWA and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants had a
three-year contract that expired July 31, 1984. Prolonged
negotiations followed but the union called a strike on March 7,
1986.
   The strike ended on May 17, 1986, when the flight attendants
offered to return to work. Only some 200 attendants had stayed out
for the entire strike.
   TWA hired 2,800 new attendants during the strike, and about
1,200 others either never joined the strike or returned to work
during it.
   The airline then cancelled the dues-checkoff provision of the
old contract, meaning that it no longer would collect union dues.
   But a federal judge, upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, ruled that the airline must honor the old contract's
provisions.
   The appeals court said the Railway Labor Act bars employers from
unilaterally cancelling union security and dues check-offs contract
provisions. Any such changes must be made in negotiations between
the employer and its workers, the appeals court said.

<HEAD>Sugarman Says He's Considering Proxy Fight For Media General Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television producer Burt Sugarman said
Tuesday he is considering waging a proxy fight for one of three
Class A seats on Media General Inc.'s board of directors as a next
step in his effort to gain control of the company.
   ``It would be interesting to have a true outside director on the
board,'' Sugarman said in an interview with the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, which is owned by Media General. ``I would look
forward to serving on the board.''
   David L. Jordan, a Media General vice president, said the
company was prepared any proxy fight mounted by Sugarman.
   Sugarman controls 9.8 percent of Media General's 28 million
shares of Class A common stock and has offered $61.50 per share for
the remainder of the company's Class A and Class B stock, or a
total of about $1.75 billion.
   The Class A shares rose $2.75 to $49 a share Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Media General has only 559,168 privately-held Class B shares
outstanding, but they have the power to elect seven of the
company's 10 directors.
   Holders of the publicly-traded Class A stock elected three
directors at last year's annual meeting, while holders of the Class
B stock elected six.
   About 71 percent of the Class B shares are owned by Chairman D.
Tennant Bryan and Vice Chairman J. Stewart Bryan III. The rest is
owned by relatives and others closely associated with them and
Media General.
   Any change in control of the company would require approval from
two-thirds of the Class B holders.
   ``It's easy for lawyers to say you can't do something, but
others would say the structure isn't fair or right,'' Sugarman
said. ``The shareholders might revolt.''
   Sugarman had asked Media General to respond to his buyout offer
by Friday. Shortly after the offer came in, the Bryans issued a
statement saying their shares ``are not for sale, for any price.''
   Sugarman made his offer through two companies of which he is
chairman: Barris Industries Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif., which
produces television game shows, and Giant Group Ltd. of
Harleyville, S.C., which makes cement.
   Media General owns a number of daily newspapers, including the
Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch and News Leader, the Winston-Salem
(N.C.) Journal and the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, plus 32 weeklies in
Southern California. It also has a 40 percent interest in Garden
State Newspapers Inc., the owner of 18 dailies and four weeklies in
eight states.
   Media General's television holdings include WCBD-TV in
Charleston, S.C., WJKS-TV in Jacksonville, Fla., and WXFL-TV in
Tampa.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilots Sue To Bar Orion Transfer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilots' union filed suit Wednesday to stop
Eastern Airlines from transferring aircraft to Orion Air in the
latest legal move to block the transfer of Eastern assets by its
parent Texas Air Corp.
   The Air Line Pilots Association's request for a temporary
restraining order was made at federal court in Washington.
   Orion, a cargo carrier based in Raleigh, N.C., has asked the
Federal Aviation Administration for certification to fly 26 Eastern
planes on Eastern routes by April 1.
   ``I don't think there is any question that this is a blatant
union-busting attempt,'' ALPA spokesman Ron Cole said Tuesday.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined to comment on the suit
Wednesday. But a day earlier, company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak
said the airline had contracted with Orion ``to protect itself
against ALPA'' in the event that its pilots refused to cross picket
lines during a possible Machinists union strike.
   Eastern is in federal mediation on its contract with the
Machinists, the largest of its three unions.
   The unions earlier protested the spinoff of Eastern's Northeast
shuttle as a separate Texas Air subsidiary and the airline's
year-old call for $490 million in labor cuts.
   The carrier lost $182 million in 1987 following a $131 million
loss in 1986. Eastern cited those losses in firing 3,500 workers
last November and another 600 in January.
   ALPA charged there was evidence Miami-based Eastern may go

management decisions reflect ``the dismantling of a great
corporation.''
