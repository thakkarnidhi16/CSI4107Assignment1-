<HEAD>Soldiers' Fear: Grenades Only A Stone's Throw Away</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>

   The stone landed just
behind the police jeep. It was a small one, and the four border
policemen in the vehicle glanced back only briefly.
   ``It's one stone, two stones. It's nothing,'' said Lior, one of
the officers. ``If it's more, we go after them with the jeep.''
   Police and soldiers who patrol the Gaza Strip say the days of
massive demonstrations that dominated the early part of the
Palestinian uprising are over.
   Now, they say, their time is taken up mostly with hurled rocks
and barricaded roads in this coastal strip that 650,000
Palestinians call home.
   But fear is growing that objects more frightening than stones
will become the norm in Gaza and the West Bank, territories
captured by Israel from Egypt and Jordan during the 1967 Middle
East war.
   On Tuesday, a grenade was hurled at an army jeep in Gaza City,
injuring two soldiers. A second grenade was tossed near a bus
carrying soldiers not far away the following day.
   Fewer than a half dozen have been thrown in Gaza during the
uprising, but soldiers say they worry there may be more as
frustration with Israeli occupation mounts.
   ``If we have many more of these, you'll start asking yourself
what's being thrown at you,'' said a young army lieutenant. ``Now
you're not supposed to fire if it's only a stone, not a
life-threatening situation. It could get bloody.''
   Under army regulations, soldiers cannot be identified by name.
But the military commander of Gaza, Maj. Gen. Tat-Aluf Zvi Poleg,
also said the potential existed for Palestinians to use weapons
more dangerous than the trademark stones.
   ``We haven't seen that many hot weapons,'' he said. ``We believe
they do have these weapons.''
   Asked if he expected more grenades and guns, Poleg said:
``History will tell. We hope not, since it would lead to more
injuries on both sides.''
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 69 Palestinians have been
fatally shot by soldiers in the Gaza Strip, according to army
figures. Thirty-two soldiers have been injured.
   According to U.N. figures, 296 Palestinians have been killed in
the uprising in the occupied lands. Six Israelis also have died,
including one soldier fatally stabbed in the West Bank.
   In August, the army introduced plastic bullets that officials
said were intended to cause fewer deaths than the standard
steel-tipped ones and be more effective than the rubber bullets and
tear gas used to break up demonstrations.
   Poleg said the plastic bullets were proving effective and less
lethal, noting there have been only six deaths of Palestinians in
Gaza since Sept. 1.
   Only officers and trained marksmen use the rubber bullets, he
said. The average soldier still carries a clip of standard
steel-tipped bullets.
   In the border police patrol Thursday through Gaza City, none of
the eight men in two jeeps carried plastic bullets.
   The border police are said to be more feared than the army by
Palestinians. Many of are Druse, a Moslem sect whose members are
the only Arabs allowed to serve in the Israeli military. They speak
Arabic and know Arab ways.
   As the jeeps crawled through darkening streets, the police met
only the lone thrown stone but many sullen looks from young
Palestinians walking the roadsides.
   At one point, a barrier of stones and debris had been set up on
a dirt street. The jeeps stopped and four Palestinians at random
were ordered to clear it.
   Policeman Lior, 19, pointed out spots along the way where stones
were usually encountered. He said he expected trouble the next day
_ today, the Moslem holy day _ and even more difficulty the
following Wednesday.
   Then, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's hardline Likud bloc is to
sponsor a trip by 50 busloads of Israelis to a Jewish settlement in
the Arab Gaza Strip.
   ``We know that will make a lot of noise,'' said Lior.

   Federal attorneys charged reputed crime boss
Vincent ``Chin'' Gigante in a civil racketeering lawsuit Thursday
with exercising control over a Teamsters union local through mob
lieutenants.
   The lawsuit also names a trucking company and a lawyer who
performed legal services for members of the local, which has been
placed under trustee by a federal judge. U.S. District Judge Harold
A. Ackerman found the local had been frozen under a quarter-century
of Mafia domination.
   Many of the allegations have surfaced before in the government's
legal battle to wrest control of Local 560. But the complaint was
the first time that Gigante, reputed head of the Genovese organized
crime family, has been targeted by the government regarding
corruption in Local 560.
   In New York, meanwhile, a federal judge sentenced Anthony ``Fat
Tony'' Salerno, the former Genovese boss who is already serving a
100-year sentence, to 70 additional years in prison for a
racketeering scheme that included construction bid-rigging,
extortion and gambling.
   The Local 560 case comes during a year of stepped up efforts
against the crime family. One indictment was brought against seven
reputed family members and associates in a business-takeover scheme.
   Another indictment charged trucking company figure Francis J.
Walsh Jr. and other reputed crime family members of arranging a
``sweetheart'' labor deal with officials of the Union City-based
union. Walsh, of Saddle River, has denied the charges.
   The court papers filed Thursday cite the same alleged scheme
involving Walsh as one of the reasons to take action against
Gigante.
   ``What we hope is to get an injunction against (Gigante's)
involvement with 560, which the Genovese family has controlled
since the early 1960s,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   ``What he controls is the family, and the family is still trying
to control the union,'' Alito said.
   The government is seeking to have Gigante barred from directly
or indirectly influencing the affairs of Local 560 or any union.
   Gigante, 60, of Old Tappan could not be reached for comment.
There was no telephone listing under his name and federal
authorities did not know who his attorney is.

   George Bush declared himself pleased with his
debate showing Thursday night but then looked ahead toward the
``homestretch of this campaign.''
   An instant ABC poll said Bush had won his second and final
debate with Democrat Michael Dukakis. Asked whether he thought he
was victorious, Bush gave a thumbs-up sign and said, ``I'm happy
with the way it came out.''
   ``I feel good about it,'' the grinning vice president told
reporters as he headed for a rally of 3,000 supporters at Loyola
Marymount University.
   In the minutes after the debate, Bush took telephone calls from
both Reagan and Quayle, said Bush spokesman Sheila Tate.
   ``You done good,'' Ms. Tate quoted Reagan as telling the
Republican presidential nominee.
   She said Quayle, who holds the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket,
told Bush, ``You hit it out of the park.''
   At the rally, Bush did not comment on his debate performance but
California Gov. George Deukmejian called the vice president ``the
heavyweight debate champion of the world.''
   ``Tomorrow we start the homestretch of this campaign,'' the vice
president told the crowd, which included singer Andy Williams,
actors Gabe Kaplan and Chuck Norris, actress Zsa Zsa Gabor and
other Hollywood celebrities.
   The vice president spent 15 minutes Thursday morning walking
through the Pauley Pavilion on the campus of the University of
California at Los Angeles, checking the lighting, podium and sound
system for the debate.
   Ms. Tate said he spent the afternoon in final debate
preparations with his advisers after having lunch with his wife,
Barbara. Aides peppered Bush with questions they believed Dukakis
might ask.
   Before the debate, his advisers expressed confidence that if
Bush managed to look relaxed and presidential and avoid any major
misstatements, he would emerge unscathed from the competition.
   Bush strategists said, however, they were braced for a possible
surprise by Dukakis, without any idea what form it might take, on
the theory it was the Massachusetts governor's last chance to give
his campaign a needed boost.
   James Lake, a top Bush adviser, said the vice president was more
relaxed going into Thursday's debate than he was for the first one
on Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   ``He feels pretty comfortable,'' Lake said.
   Bush took part in mock debates last Saturday and Tuesday with
former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard G. Darman playing the part
of Dukakis. Darman and Bush's primary debate coach, media adviser
Roger Ailes, were with him during the final hours before the debate
began.
   Lake said the Bush campaign was ``looking for (Dukakis) to do
something desperate'' to get his campaign back on track, but that
Bush was ready.
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III said that ``if the
vice president does what he did the first time, that is, appear
presidential and draw the contrast between himself and Gov.
Dukakis, that's what we'd be looking for.''

<HEAD>Excerpts From Bush-Dukakis Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of Thursday's presidential
debate between Republican Vice President George Bush and Democrat
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Q: ... Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would
you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?
   Dukakis: No, I don't ... I've opposed the death penalty during
all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and
I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with
violent crime. ... We have work to do to fight a real war and not a
phony war against drugs. ... And I want to call a hemispheric
summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight
that war.
   Bush: I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal,
so outrageous _ and I'd say particularly those that result in the
death of a police officer _ those real brutal crimes, I do believe
in the death penalty.
   Q: What have you to say about (Dan Quayle becoming president in
the event of Bush's death)?
   Bush: ... I'd have confidence in him, and I made a good
selection. ... And I've never seen a presidential campaign where
the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee.
... You know, the American people are fair. They don't like it when
there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people. They
want to judge it on the record itself.
   Dukakis: Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle and, before he did it, he
said, ``Watch my choice for vice president. It will tell all.'' And
it sure did. It sure did.
   Q: After income tax rates were cut, in each of the last five
years, some federal taxes have gone up ... Isn't the phrase ``no
new taxes'' misleading the voters?
   Bush: ... What I have proposed is something much better. And
it's going to take discipline of the executive branch. It's going
to take discipline of the congressional branch, and that is what I
call a flexible freeze that allows growth _ about 4 percent or the
rate of inflation _ but does not permit the Congress just to add on
spending.
   Dukakis: The vice president made that pledge; he's broken it
three times in the past year already, so it isn't worth the paper
it's printed on. ... And what I'm concerned about is that if we
continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this
evening _ flexible freeze _ somebody described it the other day as
a kind of economic Slurpee.
   Q: ... Do you think that a president has to be likable to be an
effective leader?
   Dukakis: ... I think I'm a reasonably likeable guy. I'm serious,
though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to
be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature. But, I'm
also a serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is
a very serious office. ...
   Q: The tenor of the campaign you've been running in terms of
both the issues and your rhetoric has surprised even some of your
friends. ...
   Bush: ... What I've had to do is to define not just my position,
but to define his (Dukakis'). And I hope I've done it fairly. ...
I'm not the one that compared the president of the United States of
rotting like a dead fish from the head down; I didn't do that. But
I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Gov. Dukakis go
through this election without explaining some of these very liberal
positions.
   Dukakis: ... I don't think these labels mean a thing, and I
would hope that tonight, and in the course of the rest of this
campaign, we can have our good, solid disagreements on issues;
there's nothing the matter with that. But let's stop labeling each
other and let's get to the heart of the matter, which is the future
of this country.
   Q: ... There has been a bipartisan consensus in favor of
modernizing the land-based missiles. Now, you have ruled out the MX
and the Midgetman. ... what type of land-based missile would you
consider?
   Dukakis: There are limits to this nation's ability to finance
these weapons systems. ... How can we build a strong America
militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? ... We
cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to
build all of these systems, and at the same time invest in
important things here at home ...
   Bush: You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that
the Soviets are going to behave themselves. ... We have enhanced
the peace. And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration
that has done exactly that. Peace through strength works.
   Q: ... Who are the heroes ... you would point out to young
Americans as figures who should inspire this country?
   Bush: I think of a teacher right here _ largely Hispanic school
_ Jamie Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of
them going on to college. ... I think of those people that took us
back into space again _ Rick Hauck and that crew ... I also think
we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United
States. ... because American people say, he is our hero.
   Q: Is there anything nice you can say about (Dukakis)?
   Bush: ... The concept of the Dukakis family has my great
respect. And I'd say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's
just an objective statement.
   Dukakis: .... We may have different approaches, we may think
that you deal with them in different days, but they're basically
American. I believe in them, George Bush believes in them, I think
the vast majority of Americans believe in them ...
   Q: Why should a woman who discovers .... the baby will live at
most two years, and those two years in incredible pain, be forced
to carry the fetus to term, and yet a woman who becomes pregnant
through incest would be allowed to abort her fetus?
   Bush: ... Bar and I lost a child ... We lost a daughter If that
child were here today, and I was told this same thing ... that
child could stay alive for 10 or 15 years, or maybe for the rest of
her life. And so, I don't think that you make an exception based on
medical knowledge at the time. ... It is personal. And I don't
assail him on that issue or others on that issue. But, that's the
way I, George Bush, feel about it.
   Dukakis: We lost a baby -- lived about 20 minutes after it was
born. But, isn't the real question that we have to answer, not how
many exceptions we make ... it's who makes the decision, who makes
this very difficult, very wrenching decision.

<TEXT>
   A power outage hit Manila and the
rest of the main Philippine island of Luzon Thursday evening,
causing huge traffic jams and shutting down the capital's rail
system.
   Power was restored to all but a few isolated places by Friday
morning, including some districts in the capital, a spokeswoman for
the National Power Corp. said.
   But sporadic blackouts still plagued scattered neighborhoods in
metropolitan Manila. Public schools were closed Friday in the
capital because of power problems and heavy rains.
   The cause of the outage was not immediately known. It affected
the 40,420-square-mile island of Luzon, the largest of the nation's
7,100 islands. Manila, which has about 7 million residents, is on
Luzon.
   Armando Plata, senior vice president of the Power Corporation,
said a series of malfunctions at power plants triggered the
blackout. But Patria Gutierrez, a corporation spokeswoman, said
``we think it is weather-related.''
   Officials said heavy rains over the island may have caused a
``domino effect'' that overloaded the island's power system.
   The private ABS-CBN television station in Manila said troops
were placed on alert as a precaution and checkpoints were
established along strategic areas of the sprawling metropolis.
   Operations at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport were
unaffected because it has emergency generators.
   In the capital, power was restored first in suburban Quezon
City, where most military camps are located, and at Malacanang
Palace, President Corazon Aquino's office compound, radio stations
reported.
   The military dispatched a dozen army trucks to ferry stranded
commuters to various points in the capital, radio stations reported.

   Listen. You can come out from under your seat
now. The really gross parts are over.
   Yes, masochists will shed a tear. But the filmic fun of flying
body parts, exploding brains and chainsaw haircuts is fading.
   Today's horror filmmakers, abandoning the point-blank plasma of
recent years, are returning to psychological thrillers, with a
wealth of lively style replacing heaps of dead teen-agers.
   ``Dead Ringers,'' which opened to brisk business at the box
office, steers away from the entrails so prevalent in director
David Cronenberg's previous efforts ``The Fly'' and ``Scanners.''
George Romero, who charmed us with cannibalizing zombies in 1979's
``Dawn of the Dead,'' just delivered ``Monkey Shines,'' a taut
chiller with hardly any viscera.
   While the splatter is gone, the suspense is back _ both ``Dead
Ringers'' and ``Monkey Shines,'' critics agree, are profoundly
frightening.
   ``There's been a lot of good scaring in the last 15-20 years,
and you can't do the same old thing anymore,'' said Wes Craven,
director of the acclaimed original ``Nightmare on Elm Street.''
``The audience was bored. They had seen it. They were ready for
something different.''
   Hack-and-slash movies, championed in the mid-1980s by the
blockbuster ``Friday the 13th'' series and later installments of
the ``Halloween'' sequels, aren't producing the packed houses they
once did. In fact, this summer's grisly shockers ``The Blob'' and
``Phantasm II'' both croaked at the box office.
   ``If your film is all a butcher-block collection of death, I
don't think you're working with as large an audience as you could
be,'' said Pen Densham, director and co-producer of ``The Kiss,'' a
spooky supernatural thriller opening Oct. 21. ``The challenge now
is to take the audience into your imagination.''
   Few have succeeded at that better than Cronenberg. While his
films have always been upsetting, the shock value in ``Dead
Ringers'' is, in a twist, as fancied as it is real. Among the most
disturbing scenes in the movie, a tale of psychotic twin doctors,
is the simple unveiling of a half-dozen malformed gynecological
devices.
   ``The instruments are physical things that I'm using to
represent a state of mind,'' Cronenberg said. ``It's only an
extrapolation from what we used to feel sitting in a dentist's
chair. Suddenly the tray of little instruments is wheeled up. You
know that technically they are to help you. But experientially
they're going to hurt.''
   The challenge for today's fright masters is to snare the
mainstream _ not just those who, for lack of anything better to do,
love being scared to death. Toward that goal, directors are
concentrating on more traditional storytelling, with a greater
emphasis on inventive visuals, tighter, more logical plots and
crative music and sound effects.
   ``The directors who are committed to the genre are maturing,''
said veteran horror specialist John Carpenter, director of
``Halloween'' and ``The Thing'' and the upcoming ``They Live.''
   Horror newcomers, too, are exploring unusual strategies to
induce fear. In ``The Kiss,'' director Densham gives life to a
swimming pool, a wind chime and an escalator. ``My goal is to try
to fuse vision with emotion,'' Densham said. In ``Child's Play,''
coming Nov. 9, director and co-writer Tom Holland has created a
fresh (and sometimes funny) white knuckler about a toy doll with a
really bad attitude.
   ``We've all become much more sophisticated in what we've grown
accustomed to on the screen,'' said Richard Rubinstein, producer of
Stephen King's ``Pet Sematary,'' due out early next year. ``If the
audience cares about the characters, then they will care when they
get into trouble. If you introduce a group of teen-agers who climb
off a bus, nobody cares when they get popped off.''
   Furthermore, the dead teen-ager movies focused on one fear _
fear of attack. When manipulations of that emotion grew too
frequent, the genre lost its original snap. ``When you got down to
that level (with anonymous children dying anonymous deaths), what
you're really doing is pornography,'' Carpenter said. ``You're only
setting the audience up for the meat.''
   Said Craven: ``There are different kinds of terror. One is just
terror of having your body harmed _ something like `Friday the
13th' with Jason coming after you with a machete. ... But there are
other kinds. There is the terror of whether you're sane or not, or
whether your perceptions are accurate or not, or whether your
dreams are real.
   ``Those sorts of things to me are much more interesting, and
much more complex, and have more of a potential for fright.''
Craven's new untitled movie, scheduled for release next year, will
focus on ``premonitions, hallucinations, dreams, religious trances
and possession.''
   Still, there will be some gore.
   ``Unless you have one scene that really scares ... people _ that
really makes them feel that not only is the killer beyond normal
rational actions but the filmmaker is too _ then the audience is
not really frightened,'' Craven said. ``But once you do that, you
don't need to do it over and over again.''
   Entrails enthusiasts, however, need not panic completely. While
there is room for style in Hollywood, there will always be a place
for low-budget slice-and-dice. Coming soon to theaters near you:
``Death Spa,'' ``Slaughterhouse Rock'' and ``Demented Death Farm
Massacre.''

   John le Carre's world of intrigue is returning to
television with ``A Perfect Spy,'' a tale that offers the same
themes of betrayal and human weakness that won acclaim for
``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ``Smiley's People.''
   But this time it's le Carre with a difference: ``A Perfect Spy''
is not so much a cloak-and-dagger thriller as a deeply personal
exploration of what makes a traitor.
   ``It's a psychological story,'' says Peter Egan, who plays
Magnus Pym, the ``perfect spy'' in the seven-part British
Broadcasting Corp. series launching the 1988-89 Mobil Masterpiece
Theater season Oct. 16 on PBS stations.
   ``This is a whydunnit not a whodunnit,'' he said in an interview.
   The ``why'' pertains to why Pym became a traitor. The series
moves from his birth in 1932, through his university days which
launch him into espionage, to his globetrotting career in
intelligence and his final unmasking and suicide.
   But the great undercover battles of East and West fought in
earlier le Carre novels are subordinated in ``A Perfect Spy'' to
the central conflict between father and son _ the quiet, restrained
Magnus and Rick, his roguish con artist father.
   Peter Lennon in ``The Listener'' called the show ``the
outstanding serial of the year,'' but most of the plaudits went to
Irish actor Ray McAnally as Rick and German actor Rudiger Weigang
as Axel, the college friend turned communist agent for whom Magnus
betrays everything.
   Sandwiched between these two colorful, high-powered roles, is
the 42-year-old Egan who had to play a man imploding quietly. He
described him as ``an empty vessel, a receiver rather than a
transmitter. ... Magnus doesn't know who he is. He has no political
beliefs and very few human ones.''
   Egan acknowledges that critical reaction to his performance was
``tepid,'' while producer Colin Rogers remarks: ``I think the
English probably underestimate acting on TV. They recognize
flamboyant characters. They don't recognize the sheer quality of
acting that I think Peter gave.''
   Whereas previous TV adaptations of le Carre called on Alec
Guinness to portray the owlish spymaster, George Smiley, the Magnus
Pym role called for a younger man with good looks, superficial
charm and an ability to express extreme stress without showing it.
   For Egan, it was a chance to further his high-visibility work in
television, following appearances in such big British productions
as ``Paradise Postponed'' and ``Edge of Darkness.''
   But although television has been good to him, Egan, who left
school at 15 to enroll at London's prestigious Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art, worries about the ``desperately minority-viewed''
status of most quality shows.
   ``Ultimately, TV is aiming for a mass audience and doesn't want
to disturb,'' he said. ``It wants to be palatable and digestible.
What's emotionally disturbing is not thought of as part of an
international diet.''
   He warned against the ``switch-on-watch-it,
switch-it-off-and-forget-it'' TV fare favored by the kind of
American programming he called ``bubble gum for the eyes.''
   Such a description is unlikely to apply to the TV movie he is
now filming for Yorkshire Television. Based on a novel by J. L.
Carr, ``A Day in Summer'' casts Egan as a legless ex-pilot who
strikes up an alliance with a bank clerk intent on avenging his
son's death.
   Egan said he looks forward to returning to the stage if he can
find a good contemporary role.
   ``There are parts of my artistic being that are not being
used,'' he said. ``I've got to blow the tubes a bit and get my
lungs working again.''

<HEAD>Generation Gap Divides London's Summer Fashion Into Two Camps</HEAD>

   There is a generation gap in London's fashion
scene for next summer: a hippie revival for the young and a touch
of Hollywood-style glamour for the sophisticated lady.
   But across the fashion divide there are some common threads.
   Color splashed back into the fashion palette. A strong wind blew
in from the East bringing Indonesian-style sarong skirts and
takeoffs on Indian saris. Fluid fabrics changed the tailored look
to a sexier silhouette. And the mini-skirt dropped to the knee, if
not below, and even fluttered around the ankle.
   The summer of '89 divided into two camps, however, at about the
age of 21.
   On the younger side, the revitalized hippie look for next summer
will be shapelier than in the sixties and have an ethnic flavor.
There'll be hip-hugging pants, transparent shirts, Nehru-style
collarless jackets in sharp colors and platform shoes.
   ``It's 20 years since it happened and the market has caught onto
this, especially among teens,'' said David Solomon, managing
director of the accessory and clothing firm Pink Soda which
features Acid House sequin T-shirts and psychedelic smile badges.
   The new hippie's sophisticated elder sister can keep some of the
lighthearted look, like an Arabella Pollen strapless dress with a
heart-shaped bra or a sprigged 1930s-style tea dress from Edina
Ronay.
   For summer nights, there is chiffon and clinging silk for in
short dramatic cocktail dresses with bare midriffs.
   Rifat Ozbek, who received the British Fashion Council's Designer
of the Year award Friday night at a fashion reception hosted by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, took the bare midriff to its
sexiest extreme.
   The Turkish-born designer drew on North Africa, showing loose
djellaba tunics and belly-dancer pants with tiny organza tops.
   Foreign buyers generally felt it was one of the few collections
that bridged the generation gap, because although it was youthful
in spirit it had a sophistication that an international woman might
relish.
   Jean Muir and Betty Jackson also spanned the two fashion camps.
   Jackson featured maharaja-tunic jackets worn with draped sarong
skirts and Indian-sequinned, wide-flowing pants for evening.
   Muir mixed perfect black dresses and psychedelic acid-bright
knits with mini-lengths. Following the Milan look, she also showed
sophisticated jumpsuits in black silk jersey, often with short
sleeves and feminine ruffled organza collars.
   Anthony Price, who has a large show-business clientele and had
American actress Angelica Huston in the audience for his show, did
a wasp-waisted merry-widow silhouette. His models came onstage
draped in transparent chiffon boudoir robes, which they peeled off
to the whoops of photographers to reveal Mae West pastel satin and
silk long-line corsets.
   In a more fantastic vein, he ruched and draped his hourglass
silhouette into exotic dresses named after tropical birds,
including one with a bustle of feathers on the derriere and another
with pterodactyl-style wings extending four feet on either side of
the body.
   London Fashion Week, which ended Monday, attracted an estimated
6,000 buyers. Normally, the British show is sandwiched between
Milan and Paris, but this year the Paris ready-to-wear decided to
show a week later than usual _ leaving a week-long gap after London.
   Some of the 300 exhibitors were worried that buyers would skip
London but organizers said the attendance in London was very good.
   Arabella Pollen said her American sales were up 30 percent, but
to old rather than new customers.
   Beth Brett, who designed an unusual line of sweaters inspired by
fruits and vegetables, was elated because the American customers
she lost last season because of the sagging dollar had returned.
``We don't know how or why, but the Americans are back in droves,''
she said.
   Edina Ronay said her American customers had also returned, but
she said other designers ``thought the show was a bit slow, a bit
less breezy, probably because of this thing with Milan and Paris.''

<HEAD>Convention Shows Thatcher Unassailable, But Some Tories Uneasy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presiding over her Conservative Party's
convention this week, Margaret Thatcher is looking unassailable.
   But 10 years into her administration, her complete control of
the party, government and political agenda is beginning to stir
unease among some Tories.
   What little dissent exists at the convention in this English
seaside resort comes across carefully coded, and its recurrent
theme is a feeling that after a decade of tough economic
management, the time has come to look at the problems of the
Thatcherite revolution.
   Peter Walker, secretary of state for Wales and one of the few
remaining liberals in Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet, came closest to
spelling it out.
   ``If we ignore the problems of the economy we will fail,'' he
said at a fringe meeting off the convention floor. ``If we ignore
social problems we will fail ... The present political climate
could create complacency and even arrogance. We must see that our
party is seen to be determined and understanding.''
   Walker's remarks reflected the nervousness of some
Conservatives, that, having won office in 1979 and apparently
heading for a fourth consecutive term in the 1990s, their party is
in danger of becoming arrogant.
   ``It is very, very hard to explain, even to our own supporters,
that the Conservatives don't hate Sheffield,'' said Irvine Patnick,
a rank-and-file Tory legislator from the economically depressed
northern steel city.
   ``They blame everything on her, they don't like her. But then
they just see her with her handbag _ that sort of thing. They don't
know her,'' said Patnick, speaking in an interview.
   A 59-year-old former builder whose north England accent
contrasts with the plummy voices of many of the middle-class or
newly rich Tories from the prosperous south, Patnick was referring
to a continuing paradox: most Britons dislike Mrs. Thatcher as a
person but like her as a leader.
   In Gallup's latest sounding, just 8 percent of voters questioned
rated Mrs. Thatcher likeable, compared with a 44 percent rating for
Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party. But 61 percent
saw her as the most suitable leader.
   Sheffield, battered by the closure of steel plants and coal
mines, has one Conservative legislator and six Laborites.
   In other great cities of northern England and Scotland,
including Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, the Conservatives won
not a single seat in the 1987 election which gave Mrs. Thatcher a
third five-year term.
   The party liberals are increasingly concerned that while the
traditional class structure is fracturing under the impact of the
new Thatcherite Tories, the north-south divide is widening.
   The nation's nurses present a typical dilemma. Their pay demands
enjoy popular support, but clash with the imperatives of
Thatcherite curbs on public spending. Thus, when Health Minister
Kenneth Clarke announced a $235 million boost for nurses' pay, he
was cheered by delegates who ordinarily have little time for
generosity at the taxpayers' expense.
   But otherwise, the liberals are a minority. ``There is no
challenge here to Mrs. Thatcher's ascendancy _ she continues to
look imperishable,'' said the liberal Guardian. And much of the
convention has been spent lining up new targets for the Thatcher
treatment.
   They range from plans to sell off British Coal, one of the last
major industries to survive Mrs. Thatcher's privatization drive, to
handing the construction of highways to independent entrepreneurs.
   Economic danger signals _ a record trade deficit and inflation
up to 5.7 percent and rising _ scarcely ruffled the atmosphere of
well-being in the convention center adorned with the slogan
``Leading Britain Into The 1990s.''
   But amid the series of congratulatory convention resolutions
were occasional signs of unease that while Mrs. Thatcher's Britain
has gotten richer, it is also more violent; its industries are more
efficient, but its cities are more littered.
   Socialist opponents blame this on a greedy, get-rich-quick
mentality they say is fostered by Thatcherism. The Thatcher remedy
is not money but what her aides call ``active citizenship'' _ a
stress on giving to charity, joining neighborhood anti-crime groups
and curbing anti-social behavior.
   But the respected conservative Economist commented that while
``active citizenship'' would do as a theme for a party convention,
it would not be seen as a solution.
   ``Enough Britons knew that they needed Nurse Thatcher's economic
medicine,'' said the weekly. ``Nanny Thatcher telling everybody to
wash their hands before tea will be ignored.''

   Key events relating to the Shroud of Turin:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1171-1203 _ Witnesses including William of Tyre in 1171 and
Robert of Clari of the fourth crusade in 1203 report seeing the
shroud in the imperial palace at Constantinople. The trail is lost
until more than a hundred years later.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1354 _ The shroud is traced to Lirey, France.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1389 _ In the earliest known challenge to the shroud, Pierre
d'Arcis, bishop of Troyes, tells Clement VII, the papal claimant in
Avignon, France, that the shroud is a fraud and the bishop who
preceded him in Troyes knows who painted it.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1453-1532 _ The shroud is kept by the royal family of Savoy at
the castle of Chambery. Fire damages it in 1532.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1578 _ The shroud begins its permanent stay at the cathedral in
Turin.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1898 _ In a rare event, the silver chest containing the shroud
is opened so a man named Secundo Pia can photograph it. The result:
the image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative, so
the negative on Pia's photographic plate gives the world its first
positive image of the man on the shroud.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1978 _ On the 400th anniversary of its arrival in Turin, the
shroud is exhibited for the first time in 45 years. An estimated 3
million people view it as it hangs suspended over an altar in a
lighted, bulletproof frame. Scientists study the shroud but say its
authenticity will remain unproven until the Vatican grants approval
for scientific dating tests.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   October 1980 _ The 32 American scientists who studied the shroud
say the image on the shroud was not painted on. The scientists,
called the Shroud of Turin Research Group, say the cloth has too
many subtle properties to be the work of a human hand.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   September 1981 _ A researcher from the U.S. group suggests in a
book there is strong evidence that the shroud was the burial cloth
of Christ. Other group members disagree.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 28, 1982 _ Alan Whanger, a Duke University professor,
compares images of Jesus on a 6th century Byzantine icon and a 7th
century coin with that on the shroud and says there are
``astonishing'' similarities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   March 30, 1982 _ Dr. Luigi Malantrucco, an Italian physician,
says after studying the shroud that Christ died on the cross of a
heart attack, not of suffocation as previously believed. He says a
spot on the shroud was of blood and serum that spurted out when
Christ was stabbed. If Christ suffocated, he says, the blood would
have coagulated.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1983 _ King Umberto II of Italy dies and bequeathes the shroud
to the pope.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   October 1986 _ The pope authorizes scientific dating tests on
the shroud.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Oct. 13, 1988 _ After widespread news leaks, the archbishop of
Turin announces that lab tests indicate the shroud is no more than
728 years old and cannot be the burial cloth of Christ.

<HEAD>Dating Of Shroud Based On Carbon In All Living Things</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Shroud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests that found the Shroud of Turin to be no more than 728
years old required less than a square inch of the linen cloth, and
were based on the fact that carbon is the basis for all living or
formerly living things.
   Laboratories at the University of Arizona, the University of
Zurich and Oxford University each received a 0.3-square-inch sample
of the shroud and two dummy cloth samples, one carbon-dated and the
other dated historically but not scientifically to see if they get
consistent results for all three samples.
   The labs were not told which sample was from the 14-foot, 3-inch
by 3-foot, 7-inch shroud, the Vatican said. The cutting was
photographed and videotaped.
   Here, briefly, is how radiocarbon dating works:
   Carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14 are the isotopes of carbon,
different only in the number of neutrons in their atomic nuclei.
The first two are stable but carbon-14 is radioactive and decays at
a known rate. Its half-life is 5,730 years _ the time it takes half
of the isotope in a material to decay.
   All living things absorb carbon, and stop absorbing it when they
die. By measuring the proportion of carbon-14 left in a sample,
scientists can tell how long ago the plant or animal it came from
died.
   To count the atoms, a sample must be converted into carbon
dioxide. This is done by burning.
   To study the shround, a technique was used that is more advanced
than original procedures used in the 1940s, when carbon-dating was
first applied. The modern technique uses a nuclear atom-counting
machine called an accelerator mass spectrometer. It propels carbon
dioxide through a tube at tremendous speed, causing the various
atomic particles to separate.

   A man who asked police to show him how their
squad car computer worked was arrested after the demonstration
showed he was wanted for a 1986 armed robbery in St. Louis.
   R.C. Gaitlin was taken into custody Tuesday night after a check
of his driver's license revealed he was a fugitive, said Detroit
Police spokesman Fred Zaharoff.
   Zaharoff said Gaitlin, 21, walked up to two patrol officers who
were showing their electronic equipment to children in a
neighborhood on the city's east side.
   When Gaitlin asked how the system worked, the officers asked him
for a piece of identification to enter into the computer. Moments
later, they learned he was wanted by St. Louis police, Zaharoff
said.
   Gaitlin was being held for extradition to Missouri, where he
will face the robbery charge, Zaharoff said.

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon once
suggested that Elvis Presley record some jailhouse rock at what is
now a federal prison in an effort to discourage drug use.
   Nixon made the suggestion during a secret visit the singer made
to Nixon on Dec. 21, 1970, when Presley offered to help Nixon
protect America from drugs, Esquire magazine reports in this
month's issue.
   A staff memo from Nixon listed five ``suggestions for Presley
activities.''
   Among them were: ``Record an album with the theme `Get High on
Life' at the federal narcotic rehabilitation and research facility
at Lexington, Kentucky.''
   The facility became a federal prison in 1974, the same year
Nixon resigned in disgrace. By then Presley had a badge declaring
him an honorary federal agent. But Lexington never got its album.
   Presley died in 1977. According to court testimony, traces of 14
prescription stimulants and depressants were found in his body.

<HEAD>Study Suggests How Asbestos Causes Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have found a clue to the enigma of
how asbestos triggers cancer, and it may lead to a way to screen
asbestos substitutes for their cancer-causing potential, a
scientist says.
   Test-tube experiments showed that asbestos fibers can bind to
genetic material outside a cell and insert the material into the
cell, damaging the genetic material in the process.
   If that happens in people, it may help explain why exposure to
asbestos causes an increased risk of lung cancer and of a cancer of
the chest lining called mesothelioma, researcher Edward Johnson
said Thursday.
   But an asbestos expert said she questioned how relevant the
test-tube findings are for human cancer.
   The work is reported in the new issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences by Johnson and his colleagues at the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
   It dealt with deoxyribonucleic acid, called DNA, which is the
substance that makes up genes. Every cell of the body contains a
set of genes, which help direct its activities.
   Cancer can result if genes are damaged or if certain ones are
activated inappropriately.
   In a series of test-tube experiments, researchers found that
asbestos fibers can bind to DNA outside a cell and introduce the
DNA to the cell's interior. Some of the DNA inserted itself among
the cell's own genes, and at least some of it reproduced itself.
   A known cancer-causing gene in the introduced DNA was found to
be active after entering cells, and a second gene remained active
18 days after entering.
   Johnson suggested that in people, the introduced DNA may trigger
cancer when it is inserted among a cell's genes. Or the DNA itself
may be damaged in such a way that it could trigger cancer, since
asbestos was found to damage the DNA it inserted, he said.
   The insertion may also trigger the cell's natural mechanisms for
DNA repair, which may end up making mistakes in repair that lead to
cancer, Johnson said.
   The work was done with monkey kidney cells to aid in testing for
reproduction of DNA. The experiments were not set up to show
whether the cells would become cancerous.
   Brooke Mossman of the University of Vermont College of Medicine
said the experimental conditions are different enough from those of
the human body that the findings may not pertain to human cancer.
   Experiments could be done with human cells instead, she said.
Mossman, who was scientific chairwoman of a recent international
workshop on the effect of asbestos and other mineral dust on cells,
also said she doubted DNA for insertion is as available in the body
as it was in the experiment.
   Johnson replied that monkey kidney cells are routinely used for
cancer studies, and that such DNA has been found in lung fluid.

   Michael Dukakis claimed victory over
Republican George Bush in their second and final debate, telling
partisan supporters that the race for the White House is ``going to
get even closer after tonight.''
   ``A clean sweep?'' the Democratic presidential nominee,
referring to his first debate with Bush and the vice presidential
clash, asked the crowd gathered for a post-debate rally at the
Beverly Hills Hilton. They roared with approval.
   ``I think we ought to have that third debate, don't you,''
Dukakis said.
   ``We've gotten the Republicans out from behind the flag factory
and the balloons and discussing the issues. That's why debates are
so important. That's why we ought to have a third debate as was
originally planned.''
   Asked during the debate if he would take part in a third debate,
Bush replied ``no'' and said the American people had seen enough
debates through the primary and presidential campaigns.
   Recent polls have shown that Dukakis faces an uphill climb in
overcoming an apparent Bush lead. The Democratic nominee said the
race is ``very, very close.''
   ``And it's going to get even closer after tonight and it's going
to get closer still in the days ahead,'' he said.
   Aides viewed the debate as vital to Dukakis' chances of winning
the support of a majority of undecided voters while persuading some
Bush supporters to reconsider their choice.
   After the debate, Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said
they ``didn't expect a knockout. What we expected was a strong
effort ... the governor spoke to people about the future tonight.''
   He showed he was ``ready to make the tough choices, not to blame
Congress, blame the press...'' like Bush.
   Dukakis, joined by his wife, Kitty, mother, Euterpe, and his two
daughters, was attending two private functions with prominent
fund-raisers and Democratic Party officials.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis, keeping with his campaign ritual,
began his day with a ``power walk,'' a brisk stroll during which
the Massachusetts governor carries hand weights.
   He then had his favorite breakfast of raisin bran cereal before
resuming briefings with aides and advisers.
   Dukakis has been in Los Angeles since Tuesday night and has
spent much of that time in briefings on issues and in
question-and-answer sessions with his entourage, which includes
Washington attorney Robert Barnett, who plays the role of Bush in
mock debates with the candidate.
   He planned to campaign in California and Washington on Friday,
including a joint appearance with his running mate, Texas Sen.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen emerged from watching the
presidential debate Thursday night and declared that Michael
Dukakis ``not only won, he won big.''
   ``With all that pressure on him, he stood up and delivered and
he put the Democratic Party on the road to victory in November,''
Bentsen told reporters at a Houston hotel where he viewed the
proceedings on television.
   The Democratic vice presidential candidate said he and Dukakis
emerged the victors in two other debates with their Republican
opponents ``and now it's three-zip and on to Nov. 8.''
   Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards, also on hand, watched the
debate as Republican presidential candidate was critical of her
comments about him in a speech she delivered to the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta.
   ``You think George's skin's a little thin?'' she said afterward.
   Earlier, Bentsen was on Capitol Hill to fire up congressional
Democrats, telling them the party can still win the White House.
   ``What we're seeing is an all-out effort on the part of
senators, the House members, Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen,'' the
vice presidential nominee told reporters after his closed-door
sessions.
   ``I was asking for their suppport and commitment and their
leadership in their own states and we had a very enthusiastic
response,'' said Bentsen, speaking after his Senate meeting.
   ``I met with the House members over there, and they're ready to
go to work and go flat out for the next 26 days.''
   Later Thursday, Bentsen was flying to Houston to watch the
presidential debate on television and to attend a post-debate rally.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen ticket is trailing George Bush and Dan
Quayle according to most polls. But Democrats hope campaigning by
their majority in both the House and Senate can help turn that
around.
   Asked by reporters if there is enough time for the Democrats to
catch Bush, Bentsen recalled the 1968 campaign.
   ``I can't help but remember my friend Hubert Humphrey, running
about 10 points behind at this point and coming within seven-tenths
of 1 percent of winning,'' he said. ``And most political pundits
said if he had two or three more days, he'd have won it.''
   After Bentsen spoke with Senate Democrats, Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas said, ``Sen. Bentsen made one of the most compelling
persuasive speeches about what the Democratic members of the United
States Senate can do. I can tell you that everybody that came out
of that room had an entirely different idea about the winnability
of this campaign.''
   ``I think there were some doubters there'' before the speech, he
said, but ``I have never seen a response from a bunch of salty old
senators that he got this morning.''
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said Bentsen told them ``Bush-Quayle
is totally inadequate. He talked aobut the winnability of the
election, and the role that members of the Senate can play.''
   Bentsen was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., who, with a slip of the tongue, seemed to express the
feelings of many senators.
   ``My colleagues, it's my pleasure to present to you the next
president _ the next vice president,'' Byrd said to roars from his
fellow Democrats.
   In the House, Bentsen met with House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and then spoke at a meeting of House Democrats. He
received loud applause several times in what attendees described as
a ``fire-'em-up'' address.
   Before he left, Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, who played the role
of Quayle to help Bentsen prepare for the vice presidential debate,
took the other lectern in the House chamber, according to lawmakers
and others who attended.
   Eckart went into his Quayle imitation and when he demanded,
``Senator, what are your qualifications,'' Bentsen pounced.
   ``Congressman, I know Dan Quayle. I've served with Dan Quayle.
And you're no Dan Quayle,'' he said, recalling his scolding of
Quayle in their debate after the Indiana senator compared his
experience with that of John Kennedy in 1960.
   ``It brought down the House,'' said one lawmaker.

<HEAD>LOS ANGELES: wrenching decision.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Let's assume now (you are president). You are now facing that
dreaded last resort -- increase taxes. Which tax do you decide is
the least onerous?
   Dukakis: ... We have had not one but two detailed studies which
indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be
collected that are not being paid in. ... And that is just
absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their
taxes and pay them on time.
   Q: ... Can you stand here tonight and look a whole generation
... in the eye ... and tell them that they should be financing the
retirement of people like yourself, like Governor Dukakis ...
   Bush: ... We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund
was in great jeopardy. And the President took the leadership,
working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress. ... The
Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent
condition. ... So I don't want to fool around with it. ... And I
will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security. I
learned that the hard way. ...
   Dukakis: ... George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social
Security was basically a welfare system. And in 1985 he flew back
from the West Coast to cut that COLA. ...
   Q: ... Would your nominees to the Supreme Court have to pass
something that has been called a kind of conservative ideological
litmus test, and would you give us an idea of perhaps who two or
three people on your short list are for the court?
   Bush: Well one, I don't have a list yet. ... And secondly ... I
don't have any litmus test. But, what I would do is appoint people
to the federal bench that will not legislate from the bench, who
will interpret the Constitution....
   Dukakis: If the vice president of the United States thinks that
Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment, that is a very good
reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of
November. ...
   Q: Would you commit yourself to any of those hard choices, such
as which ... entitlements ought to be redrawn?
   Dukakis: ... Why do people who want to balance budgets, or bring
the deficit down, always go to those programs which tend to benefit
people of very modest means? ... I'm not going to go to
entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit ...
   Bush: ... Let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to
cut COLAs. ... I'm going to keep the Social Security entitlement,
to keep that trust fund sound.
   Q: Governor ... originally you sought an exemption for Social
Security COLAs in this National Governors Association vote. ...
But, when you lost that vote, you, then, endorsed the over-all
freeze proposal. ...
   Dukakis: That is absolutely not true ...
   Q: ... aren't you demagoguing the Social Security issue?
   Dukakis: No ... I just have to correct the record. That simply
isn't true. ... everybody knew that those of us who voted against
the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically ...
   Q: ... How do you square your campaign rhetoric with
(environental) record?
   Bush: ... I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether
you're going to double the spending. That is the same old argument
that'd gotten us into the trouble on the deficit side. ... I'm not
going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from
Massachussetts off the beaches off of New Jersey ... I am an
evironmentalist.
   Dukakis: ... I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about
here, or looking at -- the George Bush who was a charter member of
the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the
early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing
and listening to the past two or three months. ...
   Q: ... would you agree to another debate ... ?
   Bush: No, I will not agree to another debate. The American
people are up to here with debates. ... I think we can all share
... in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out. But,
it's not getting out because they're too few debates. There will be
no more debates.
   Dukakis: ... I think if we get rid of the labels and _ I'm not
keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ``liberal''
at least 10 times. If I had a dollar, George, for every time you
used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the
rich that you want to give away. ...
   Q: Is (nuclear weapons plant maintenance) a priority that you
feel has been ignored by this administration?
   Dukakis: ... What's been going on? Who's been in charge? Who's
been managing this system? Why have there been these safety
violations? ... Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for
this ...
   Bush: That is the closest I've ever heard the governor of
Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear.
That's about as close as I've ever heard him. ... Will he join me
in suggesting that we may need another plant, maybe in Idaho, to
take care of the requirements -- nuclear material requirements for
our Defense Department. I hope he will. ...
   Q: ... If you become president, will you lock that revolving
door that has allowed some men and women in the government to come
back and lobby the very departments they once managed?
   Bush: Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too. ... I get kidded
by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe
in public service. ... I will have an ethical office in the White
House that will be under the president's personal concern. ...
   Dukakis: ... Wasn't this the Mr. Bush that supported Mr. Meese?
Called James Watt an excellent secretary of the Interior? Provided
support for some of these people ... We've had dozens, we've had
dozens and dozens of officials in this administration, who have
left under a cloud, who have left with a special prosecutor on
their arm. They've been indicted, convicted. ...
   Closing remarks:
   Dukakis: ... Our opponents say, ``Things are okay. ... '' But I
don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a
year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to
foreign bankers ... or when we have two and a half million of our
fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and
living on streets and in doorways in this country, or when Mr.
Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway
to the rich. We can do better than that. ...
   Bush: ... I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for
the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage. But we have
enormous differences. I want to hold the line on taxes and keep
this, the longest expansion in modern history, going until
everybody in America benefits. I want to invest in our children,
because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.
... This election is about big things, and perhaps the biggest is
world peace. And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in
working with a president who has revolutionized the situation
around the world. ... I want to build on that.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen says Michael Dukakis ``won big'' in his final matchup with
George Bush. He says the debate score is ``three-zip,'' favor of
the Democrats.
   The Texas senator, who watched the debate on television in a
Houston hotel, is flying out to Sacramento today to introduce
Dukakis at a post-debate celebration at the California state
capitol. But he didn't wait to proclaim victory.
   He gave reporters a thumbs-up as he left his hotel after the
debate for a late-night rally nearby.
   ``Before tonight we were two-zero on the debates and now it's
three-zip and now to November 8,'' he told a Democratic crowd of
about 500 who gathered at Houston's convention center to watch
Dukakis battle Bush on a big screen television.
   ``He not only won, he won big,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen was introduced at the rally by Texas state treasurer Ann
Richards, the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta. Although he didn't name her, Richards was one of those
who Bush during the debate accused of launching a dirty campaign by
besmirching his name at the Democratic convention.
   ``Well, I'm that lady from Texas with all that hair,'' she said.
``You think George's skins a little thin?''
   Richards denied Democrats did anything like the Republican
attacks that she said have tried to impugn the integrity and
patriotism of Dukakis.
   ``All I heard in Atlanta was that George Bush will not make a
good president of the United States,'' she said.
   ``And then George proved it himself by nominating Dan Quayle,''
she said.
   Bentsen, who before the debate was saying that Dukakis did not
have any more pressure on him than Bush did, credited the
Democratic nominee afterward for succeeding despite the odds.
   ``With all that pressure on him, he stood up and he delivered
and he put the Democratic party on the road to victory in
November,'' he said at the rally. ``He won because he gave honest
answers to the problems and concerns facing America.''

   For the past few months, the Ohio Lottery has
been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of Cleveland Stadium
reminding fans that a $3 million lottery jackpot isn't ``chicken
feed'' or ``chopped liver.''
   During an era when jackpots around the country are regularly
topping $20 million, the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir
up interest in ``Super Lotto'' prizes that a decade ago would have
made newspaper front pages.
   ``We are looking for an expanded base of players,'' said Anne
Bloomberg, Ohio Lottery spokeswoman. ``We want the players to
understand that $3 million is a lot of money. While the giant
jackpots get a lot of focus, $150,000 (annual earnings for 20 years
in a $3 million prize) is a lot of money.''
   The explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play
around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by
dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars, said Paul
Dworin, publisher of Gaming and Wagering Business magazine in New
York.
   ``Florida awards a $55 million jackpot, and a lot of people are
not going to get excited by lower numbers,'' Dworin said. ``Why
play when it's $10 million if it could be $50 million?''
   Florida's $55 million prize, awarded after a Sept. 3 drawing, is
the nation's largest lottery jackpot to date. Six of the 10 largest
jackpots have been awarded this year, records show.
   Many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to
trigger ``lotto mania,'' described as the point when sales increase
dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize. In
most ``lotto'' contests, participants try to guess a series of
numbers to be drawn, and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct
match.
   In Illinois, the attitude of players has changed since the state
started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a high-payoff lotto game
in 1983, said Kathy Rem, lottery communication director.
   ``After a lottery has been around a number of years, people get
used to it. Our players have gotten more sophisticated,'' Ms. Rem
said.
   Asked when ``lotto mania'' begins, she added, ``If you wanted a
number, I'd say $20 million.''
   New York recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to
attract upscale, casual players, said Russell Gladieux, acting
director of the New York State Lottery.
   ``We've completely restructured our advertising to get the
person who wouldn't play for $4 million but would play for $20
million,'' Gladieux said. ``We've begun featuring well-dressed,
well-educated, real people who share their dream of winning, on
television.''
   New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine operate a tri-state lotto, but
with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot
of $9.6 million, the contest may never generate ``lotto mania,''
said Rick Wisler, games manager for the New Hampshire Sweepstakes
Commission.
   Blaine Lewis Jr., president of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said newspaper coverage illustrates
how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars.
   ``In 1983, with a $1.4 million winner in Connecticut, we got a
front page story in The Hartford Courant,'' said Lewis, who tracks
lotteries in 28 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands and five Canadian provinces. He said the same
lottery story in 1988 probably wouldn't make the front section of
the newspaper.
   ``People and the press are getting jaded, but most people still
realize a million dollars is a lot of money,'' he said.
   Dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for
lotteries to increase the odds of winning.
   ``If you increase the (choice of numbers), the odds are much
longer and therefore even if more people play, there's a higher
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots,'' Dworin
said.
   In Ohio, where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44, the
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been
$32 million. Ms. Bloomberg said there are several points when sales
increase.
   ``Ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some
casual players come in,'' said Ms. Bloomberg. ``At $13 million to
$15 million, about 80 percent come in.''
   She said once the jackpot exceeds $15 million, just about
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who
can't by law.
   ``When we get the big jackpots, the attention heightens
visibility, which heightens sales, which heightens the jackpot and
it just keeps going,'' she said.

   A single mother's determined journey from
welfare to work earned her a trip to the White House to see
President Reagan sign legislation designed to help other women do
the same.
   ``I'm a happy person now that I'm working and I'm not on
welfare,'' said Evelyn Vega, 28, of Stamford, Conn. ``Now that the
government did all this, it could be a chance to help a lot of
women like me.''
   Reagan signed a major welfare overhaul bill Thursday that will
offer education, training and work programs aimed at putting
welfare recipients to work. Ms. Vega, whose trip to Washington was
funded by the United Way, said she considers herself a symbol of
the gains other women can make.
   Three years ago Ms. Vega was on welfare and could not read or
write, much less hold a job.
   Now, with help from government and non-profit groups, she
manages a fast-food store, has her own car and says her goal is to
send her three daughters to college.
   Ms. Vega, whose parents separated when she was young, said she
largely raised herself after running away from home at age 10. She
and an older sister traveled from Puerto Rico to several U.S.
states, and Ms. Vega became pregnant for the first time at age 15.
   Three years ago, when all of her daughters were old enough to
attend school, Ms. Vega went to her welfare caseworker and said she
wanted to get off public assistance.
   ``I was so lonely. I was so scared,'' she said. ``I didn't want
to sit there with my girls going to school and me doing nothing.''
   Ms. Vega got a tutor, Page Oristano, from the Literacy
Volunteers of America, who began to teach her reading, writing and
basic skills such as how to look up a number in the telephone book.
   Eventually another non-profit group agreed to help her find an
entry-level job in a fast-food store, and the manager there decided
to help her train for a management job.
   She passed the management test a month ago with 98 of 100
possible points. Several months earlier, Ms. Vega received her last
welfare check.
   ``I'm a single woman and I'm just taking care of my girls and
I'm happy,'' Ms. Vega said. ``Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning,
but it's OK.''
   She reads at the third or fourth grade level, but higher when
the material is job-related, and she has a good chance of finishing
high school, Ms. Oristano said.
   Ms. Vega's goal is to send her daughters to college, get her
high school diploma and eventually attend college herself.
   Ms. Vega said she is convinced other welfare mothers can get off
public assistance.
   ``They've got to say, `I'm going to do it. I'm going to stick
with it and I'm not going to go back,''' she said.
   The Family Support Act signed by Reagan on Thursday provides
money to states and requires them to offer education and job
training to women with children age 3 and over. It also puts new
pressure on absent parents to pay child support.
   The incentive to get off welfare,'' Ms. Vegas said, ``has to
come from the person because the programs are there.''

<HEAD>Monster Pork Bill Too Much for House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minor bill making a single federal
appropriation ballooned 8,700 percent into a $60 million pork
barrel full of back-home booty for powerful lawmakers before the
House finally scuttled it.
   ``This is a disgusting piece of legislation,'' Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa., said Thursday as he began the attack that ended in
the House voting 256-131 against even debating the bulging package.
   Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., called the bill ``the perfect model
of how Congress is a pork farm. There are so many little piglets in
this bill it probably sets the Guinness World Book record about how
a bill grew in conference.''
   The bill began life in the House earlier this year as a simple
proposition: authorizing the Department of Education to provide
$750,000 to the Taft Institute, which uses public and private money
to run summer programs for high school civics studies teachers.
   Then the fattening process began.
   Added by the Senate were $15.2 million in authorizations for
federal grants to a library in the District of Columbia, the
Vermont Council of Higher Education, Voorhees College in South
Carolina and the University of Mississippi.
   At least two of the add-ons pointed in the direction of two
senior members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which
handled the bill: Robert Stafford, R-Vt., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   As often occurs in these situations, some insurance was added:
the Mississippi money. Sen. John Stennis and Rep. Jamie Whitten,
both D-Miss., chair the appropriations committees that would have
to free up the funds for the grants.
   ``That's the way you get the money in the appropriations
process,'' said Walker.
   Because of the Senate amendments, the bill had to go to a joint
conference committee, which upped the ante by authorizing another
$45.15 million in grants to universities and other educational
facilities.
   Walker and his allies said it was not coincidental that seven of
the 12 grants tacked on in conference were headed for institutions
located in states represented by conferees.
   One of the conference leaders, Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.,
snagged three of them worth $6.15 million. The head Senate
conferee, Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., got the single biggest hunk, $10
million for the Massachusetts Corporation for Education Technology.
   Stafford, a Senate conferee, found a familiar face among the
House conferees, Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt. In the final package
was a provision allowing a Vermont-New England consortium to coax
as much money as it needs out of the appropriations committees.
   Time for more insurance: a grant for $500,000 for the Claude and
Mildred Pepper Scholarship Program, with provision for it to seek
more money down the road through the appropriations process.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairs the House Rules Committee,
which sent the bill to the floor Thursday with a rule that
prohibited Walker & Co. from lodging and easily winning challenges
to the germaneness of the add-ons.
   ``If Americans want to know why budget deficits are so high, all
they have to do is look at this bill,'' said Walker, successfully
urging colleagues to kill the bill by voting against the rule.
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said that ``we're famous for having
gargantuan side show freaks grow out of nothing, but this one tops
them all.''
   ``If this were not so pitiful it would be funny,'' said Rep.
Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.
   Walker said the bill's authorized spending grew by some 8,700
percent _ ballooning into a clearly seen target _ because there was
no need this year for a continuing resolution, a type of massive
catchall spending legislation that offers a perfect hiding place
for add-ons.
   Opponents said some of the extras had already been spotted this
year trying to ride through Congress on other bills. They said some
of the money was aimed at educational programs that had had grant
applications rejected at the Education Department.
   Defending the bill, Williams pointed out that not all the
proposed grants were going to states and districts represented by
conferees.
   ``Those of us on the conference committee really resent the
implication we're lining the pockets of our districts,'' he said.
   The House action left the Taft Institute without authorization
to continue receiving federal money. The future of that money,
however, was in doubt because the Reagan administration, even
before the add-ons occurred, had threatened to veto the bill.

<HEAD>AIDS Bill Passes but Without Confidentiality Guarantee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of expanded AIDS testing say they
will try again next year to win congressional guarantees of the
confidentiality of medical tests for people who might be suffering
from the disease.
   ``We're going to offer it again next session and we will win,
but we will have lost precious time until then,'' said Rep. Henry
Waxman, D-Calif., one of the chief authors of a package of health
legislation approved Thursday by Congress.
   The bill, which now goes to President Reagan for his expected
signature, includes up to $800 million a year for new AIDS-fighting
programs. Both the House and Senate approved it by voice vote.
   Plans to ensure the confidentiality of AIDS tests were dropped
from the bill after objections from conservatives, chiefly Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C. With Congress trying to clear its agenda and
heading for a year-end adjournment, Helms had threatened to use
Senate rules to block the measure.
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, said, ``I'm obviously pleased the bill went through,
but I'm obviously saddened that the confidentiality provision has
been taken out.''
   ``Confidentiality is something we really need if we're going to
get at the high-risk groups for AIDS,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his San Francisco office. ``It's going to be a
priority for us next year.''
   Morton Halperin, director of the local ACLU office, said,
``While we applaud the fact that Congress has passed three-quarters
of an AIDS package, we are disappointed that the bill does not
include the essential final section _ the testing, counseling and
confidentiality protections that had been part of the original
package.''
   The bill authorizes $100 million a year for AIDS testing over
the next two years, another $100 million in each of the next two
years for home health care of AIDS victims, up to $300 million in
new research funds in each of the next three years, and $370
million for AIDS education.
   The testing provisions are the program's centerpiece, but the
$100 million is only one-quarter of the original $400 million
program approved by the House last month. Despite the lack of an
overall federal guarantee of confidentiality, the program will be
anonymous to the extent permitted by state laws.
   Waxman said, ``It's certainly less than we wanted, but it will
provide for testing for those high-risk individuals whom we most
want to reach. We are achieving part of our goal by providing
anonymous testing.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, called the bill ``the first
comprehensive federal response to the AIDS epidemic since it was
identified at the beginning of this decade.''
   ``There is an overwhelming consensus in this Congress that a
plan of national leadership and commitment is necessary to combat
the most important public health crisis of our time,'' he said.
   The legislation combined the two very different AIDS-related
bills which had passed the House and Senate separately earlier this
year. The Senate version, approved in April, was more restrictive
than the measure approved by the House last month.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease which attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of Sept. 26, AIDS had been diagnosed in 74,447 Americans, of
whom 41,925 have died, according to the Centers for Disease
Control. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   President Reagan and the chief architect of
the nation's new welfare reform law are expressing hope it will
transform many dependent on a government check into productive
members of the work force.
   ``This bill ... will lead to lasting emancipation from welfare
dependency,'' Reagan said Thursday as he put his signature on the
most ambitious revision of the welfare system since it was created
during the Depression.
   Under the bill, formally known as the Family Support Act, states
are required for the first time to offer people on welfare a broad
variety of education, training and work programs.
   The measure contains mandatory work provisions for some
recipients and provides child care assistance to help them keep
their jobs.
   At the Rose Garden signing ceremony, the president said the bill
embodies a demand from the citizens who pay the bills: ``that you
will do your share in taking responsibility for your life and for
the lives of the children you bring into this world.''
   Also present was the chief architect of the bill, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``I've been waiting 20 years for this day,'' said the exultant
senator following the ceremony. He said he hoped its features would
take hold fully by the end of the century.
   Under the complex legislation, various programs have differing
starting dates.
   ``If by the end of the century we haven't changed this system,
it will be a big disappointment. It has taken a generation to get
here; it takes at least a half a generation to get out of it,''
Moynihan said.
   The legislation contains the most sweeping revision of the
nation's principal welfare program _ Aid to Families with Dependent
Children _ since it was created in 1935. Currently, the
federal-state welfare program serves 3.7 million families.

   Homeless groups trying to obtain surplus
government property are running up against reluctant federal
officials despite a court order stopping the sale of real estate
that otherwise might provide shelter.
   Witnesses before a congressional subcommittee testified Thursday
that efforts to gain 10 acres of surplus property in New Jersey met
with a string of refusals. They said a crisis is brewing with
``working homeless'' camping in regional parks outside the nation's
capital.
   Members of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
government activities and transportation scolded administration
officials for failing to make surplus real estate and buildings
available to the homeless and called for an investigation of the
Inter-Agency Council on the Homeless, which was set up to lead the
effort against homelessness.
   The hearing followed an order Sept. 30 by U.S. District Judge
Oliver Gasch barring the sale of surplus federal buildings covered
by the 1987 McKinney Act until Housing and Urban Development
officials determine which ones can be used for programs to help the
homeless.
   Maria Fascarinis, attorney for the National Coalition for the
Homeless, which filed the federal suit, said homelessness has
exploded around the country, with the number increasing 25 percent
to 3 million last year.
   ``While pursuing policies that cause and exacerbate
homelessness, the current administration has refused to take any
remedial action to address what is now clearly a national
catastrophe,'' Ms. Fascarinis told the subcommittee.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., subcommittee chairwoman, told
General Services Agency acting administrator Richard G. Austin:
``It seems to me that your results have been awfully, awfully
small.''
   The agency has identified only 12 properties that might be used
by the homeless, and some of those have since been withdrawn by the
agencies controlling them, Austin acknowledged.
   He said 335 properties, making up 28,936 acres, are in the GSA's
excess and surplus property inventory, and since the court order
the agency has been reviewing them with HUD to determine which
might be suitable for the homeless. The order requires that HUD,
rather than agencies owning the surplus properties, determine which
might be used.
   Austin said a useable property would require available
electricity, plumbing, heating and day and night access.
   He acknowledged that some GSA officials had been
``overenthusiastic'' in turning down a homeless group's application
for the 10-acre plot in Edison, N.J., and said the issue would be
taken up again with local officials who want the property for other
uses.
   Robert Nasdor, spokesman for the Middlesex Interfaith Partners
with the Homeless, said about 90 families are being put up by the
government in motels in the Edison area at a cost of up to $2,400 a
month for room rent.
   ``The effect of living in these facilities on families is
devastating,'' Nasdor said.
   GSA has scheduled a public meeting next Tuesday in Edison to
consider proposals by the city and others for use of the property
which has been declared surplus and is under GSA jurisdiction.
   Rep. Howard Nielson, R-Utah, challenged Austin to be more
aggressive in seeking federal property for the homeless.
   Nielson said Congress, in passing the McKinney Act last year,
clearly intended that the homeless problem be given high priority.
``I would suggest that you be much more aggressive with other
agencies, put a little pressure on them to set some property
aside,'' Nielsen told Austin.
   Victoria Luna, of the Metropolitan Washington Union of the
Homeless, testified that scores of working homeless are living in
parks in Washington's Virginia suburbs. She said many are
construction workers from West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio who make
good money but not good enough to pay the Washington area's
inflated rents.
   ``We have a crisis here. The regional parks will be closing this
month, and winter is coming,'' said Mrs. Luna.

<HEAD>Jury Out on Financial Benefits of Organic Gardening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organic farming can yield ``real and
significant'' environmental and health benefits, but the jury is
still out on whether it pays farmers to adopt such a strategy, two
analysts write.
   More research ``designed to increase the profitability of
alternative agriculture deserves serious consideration,'' wrote the
analysts, Pierre R. Crosson and Janet Ekey Ostrov.
   Farmers ``receive few of the environmental benefits of
alternative agriculture because many of these, such as improved
water quality, occur off the farm, or like improved wildlife
habitat, cannot be captured in economic terms,'' they wrote in a
newsletter of Resources for the Future, a Washington-based
environmental policy research organization.
   ``Consequently, farmers decide to adopt alternative agriculture
or stay with the conventional system by comparing the economics of
the two.''
   Organic farmers, who tend more and more to call themselves
``alternative'' or ``low-input'' farmers, use few chemical
pesticides and fertilizers and some use none at all.
   Endorsing the call for more research, two prominent figures in
the alterative farming movement said Crosson and Ostrov were too
cautious about the economic benefits to farmers using low-input
techniques.
   ``I have been on too many of these farms not to know that they
can be very, very profitable,'' said Garth Youngbird, director of
the Institute for Alternative Agriculture in Beltsville, Md.
``Economists haven't really looked at this.''
   At the Rodale Organization in Emmaus, Pa., editor George de
Vault gave a simple example: ``Instead of broadcasting a herbicide,
use it in strips a foot wide down the row.'' Fertilizer costs are
cut by two-thirds if the plant is in rows 36 inches apart. ``You
still cultivate between the rows,'' he said.
   The Crosson-Ostrov article said research was particularly needed
on weed control since a ``main source of the disadvantages is the
difficulty of controlling weeds without herbicides,'' and on
wildlife habitat, which has not been systematically studied to
compare conventional and alternative farming.
   Pesticide contamination of ground water by 73 compounds has been
found in 34 states, and there are many predictions that more will
be found simply because people are looking for it more.
   But Crosson and Ostrov said concentrations were seldom high
enough to threaten health, and data on surface-water contamination
were even scarcer than gound water contamination. In light of the
uncertainties, ``it is therefore impossible to judge whether the
reduced use of pesticides with alternative agriculture would
generate enough water quality benefits to offset the higher
economic costs.''
   However, they said, ``some offset seems likely.''
   They also noted that heavy use of manure can cause the same
problems of excess nitrates in water supplies as the use of
synthetic compounds. However, they said, soil conservation
practices typical of most alternative farming methods may reduce
phosphorous runoff to surface water.
   So-called conservation tillage now practiced by a third of the
nation's farms leaves a large fraction of the crop residue on the
soil to keep it in place, but is not generally counted as a
``low-input'' technique because it ``relies on herbicides at least
as much as, and often more than, conventional tillage. ... Its
benefits might be bought at a higher environmental price.''
   There is little evidence that pesticide residues in food are a
serious threat to health, the article said. A National Research
Council study last year concluded that in the theoretical worst
case, pesticides in food increase the average chance of getting
cancer by six in a thousand, and more likely one in a thousand.
   The greatest harm from pesticides falls on users. ``Deaths from
pesticides by accident, homicide and suicide are estimated to have
been several hundred per year in the 1970s. Estimated illnesses
from pesticide poisonings at that time were in the tens of
thousands. ... The fact that alternative agriculture would
drastically reduce if not eliminate these human costs of handling
pesticides probably is its most important environmental advantage.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-year effort by Congress to pass the most
sweeping restructuring of the nation's financial system in 50 years
has been killed by a jurisdictional dispute in the House.
   The House Banking Committee, chaired by Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, D-R.I., and the Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., had passed competing versions of
legislation permitting bank holding companies to underwrite
securities for the first time since passage of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall Act.
   After three weeks of fruitless negotiations between the two
committees, St Germain sought to persuade House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, to permit the full House to vote on his version of the
bill.
   But Wright, in a private meeting Thursday with Democratic
members of the Banking and Rules committees, refused to settle the
dispute. Congress is planning to adjourn next week.
   ``It's obvious we're not going to be able to move much further
on the banking bill in this Congress,'' St Germain said.
   However, Wright has agreed to define more specifically which
sections of a banking bill would be sent to Dingell next year.
   ``Since I do not anticipate any major changes on my committee
... I think it's safe to assume we can act very expeditiously at
the beginning of the next Congress,'' St Germain said in a
telephone interview. ``It's our hope that ... we do not have a
repetition of the impasse.''
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., an advocate of expanded banking
powers, said, ``I feel that a different direction will be taken
next year.''
   Meanwhile, in the Senate, Banking Committee staff director
Kenneth A. McLean said a strategy by Chairman William Proxmire,
D-Wis., to bypass the jurisdictional tangle in the House is all but
dead.
   Proxmire had hoped that re-passing the Senate bill approved in
March and attaching it to an unrelated banking bill would have
given his counterparts in the House a vehicle to circumvent Dingell.
   However, his plan was thwarted by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
a strong advocate of the securities industry's views. He threatened
to tie up the bill in lengthy debate.
   The deadlock means nearly two years of maneuvering and hearings
have fizzled with no result.
   The Senate, with only two members including D'Amato voting `no,'
passed legislation in March broadly expanding banks' securities
powers and named it after Proxmire, who is retiring after 30 years
in the Senate.
   The banking industry, which strongly supported the Senate bill,
began to lose interest when St Germain in July added pro-consumer
provisions bankers considered too expensive, including requirements
that banks cash government checks for non-customers and provide
low-cost checking accounts for poor people.
   Dingell's version, adopted by his committee three weeks ago, was
even less appealing to banks and would not, as St Germain's bill
would, permit bank underwriting of corporate bonds and mutual funds.
   In the end, more special interests were favoring no legislation
rather than any likely compromise. Only the insurance industry
stood to gain because under most of the proposals, banks would have
been hindered from entering their business.
   Some legislators fear that in the absence of congressional
action, the courts and regulatory agencies will grant banks new
powers through loopholes.
   ``The marketplace continues to change and evolve. It's clear the
(Federal Reserve) will move ahead in the securities area and it's
clear the courts have already given the green light,'' said Edward
Yingling, top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
   Wright, in a letter Thursday, appeared to warn Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan against precipitous deregulation.
   ``Any change in the provisions of the law ... is rightfully a
legislative concern,'' Wright said. ``Be assured that the
legislative branch of the government will fulfill its
responsibilities.''

   Here are major provisions in the bill signed
into law Thursday to overhaul the national welfare system, which
provides help to 3.7 million families:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _THE BILL'S PHILOSOPHY: The government provides additional
training and support for people on welfare but requires recipients
to strive for independence. To help people move from welfare to
jobs, the government will help foot their costs for child care and
for medical insurance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _WORK, TRAINING AND SCHOOLING: Able-bodied welfare recipients _
chiefly mothers _ whose children are over age 3 would be required
to participate in work, training or education programs. They could
take jobs, receive on-the-job training or go back to school for
remedial education, literacy classes, job readiness activities. The
program is known as the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS)
program. The states, if they want, may require participation by
parents of children over age 1.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _TOUGHEST CASES: States must concentrate most of their money on
the toughest cases _ young parents without a high school education,
long-term recipients and families with older children who are
expected to lose eligibility.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _HELP FOR RECIPIENTS: Participants in the JOBS program will
receive transportation and child care help. Parents on welfare
working their way off the rolls will qualify for a year of
transitional child care and Medicaid benefits. States may charge
the recipients part of the costs of these transitional services.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: By 1995, 20 percent of eligible parents
must be participating in JOBS. This will amount to about 400,000
people in any given month and nearly 1.5 million over the course of
a year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _HELP FOR FAMILIES WITH TWO PARENTS AT HOME: For the first time,
the federal government will require all states to pay cash benefits
to poor families with two parents at home. Only 27 do so now.
However, states adding the benefit can limit it to six months a
year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _REQUIRED WORK: Starting in 1994, one adult in each two-parent
welfare household must participate in a job search and, if it
fails, 16 hours a week in a community-service job. A young parent
may work instead toward a high school diploma.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _CASH BENEFITS: There will be no increase in cash benefits,
which in many states are well below the poverty line. A House
proposal giving states financial incentives to raise benefits was
eliminated by House, Senate and White House negotiators.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _CHILD SUPPORT: States will have to step up child support
collections from absent parents. The states must begin withholding
child-support payments from the wages of absent parents when a
court orders that these payments be made. States will get federal
money to set up a computerized tracking and monitoring system to
enforce child support orders.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _COSTS: To pay for the additional cost to the government arising
from the new law, a variety of new tax provisions are established.
Parents will no longer be able to claim the child-care tax credit
for children older than 13; it previously extended to children
below 16. Taxpayers who claim the child-care tax credit will be
required to list the name, address and Social Security number of
the person paid to care for their children so the government can
make sure babysitters are paying taxes on their earnings. The law
also extends an expiring Internal Revenue Service debt collection
program for five years.

<HEAD>Survey Tallies Colleges And University Repair Needs: $70 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Classrooms, libraries and laboratories at the
nation's colleges and universities are deteriorating and it could
take $70 billion to shape up America's campuses, a report says.
   Schools are facing repairs not just to older buildings, but also
to newer buildings that were not as well constructed, said
consultant Sean Rush, who worked on the survey released Thursday by
two associations of school officials.
   ``We know now that the cost of modernizing and maintaining
higher education facilities is grossly misunderstood,
underestimated and underfunded,'' said Walter A. Schaw, executive
vice president of the Association of Physical Plant Administrators,
which co-sponsored the study with the National Association of
College and University Business Officers.
   Schaw said in an interview that ordinary repairs in masonry,
electrical systems, plumbing, roofing and other parts of buildings
urgently need attention on most campuses, while some schools have
outdated classrooms and laboratories that need to be replaced.
Others have buildings with serious hidden problems such as
termites, he said.
   The report, ``The Decaying American Campus: A Ticking Time
Bomb,'' was prepared by the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand,
based on responses to a 16-page survey sent to 702 institutions.
Estimates of the total problem were extrapolated from 217 responses
to the survey.
   ``We are not allocating enough funds to properly maintain
existing structures, let alone renew the laboratories, libraries
and classrooms necessary to provide a quality education for our
young people,'' said Schaw.
   In some cases cost cutting has made problems worse, he said.
   As an example, he cited Doric columns at the University of
Maryland at College Park which for want of $8,000 worth of painting
through the years will have to be replaced at a cost of $350,000.
On the other hand, he said, the same university has paid for recent
dormitory renovation with energy-saving measures.
   ``Just like a car and house, it costs more to repair if you put
it off. The longer you wait, the worse the problem is,'' he said.
   The survey concluded that the policy of deferring expenses for
needed repairs and maintenance has led to an estimated $20 billion
backlog of urgently needed work.
   Potential need could reach between $60 billion and $70 billion,
the report said.
   Schaw said the survey estimates that, based on $100 per square
foot in replacement value, facilities on the nation's more than
3,300 institutions of higher education are worth $300 billion.
   ``The capital renewal and replacement needs of our colleges and
universities are a ticking time bomb,'' said Caspa L. Harris Jr.,
executive vice president of the business officers group. ``The
problem is here and now, and it has to be addressed.''
   The study estimates that institutions budgeted $1.2 billion for
repair and maintenance this year _ one-fourth of the need.
   It says that although the number of square feet of campus
facility space has increased by more than 50 percent since 1970,
the share of university and college budgets given to the physical
plant has remained almost constant.

   Iran has not stopped and searched a
merchant ship in the Persian Gulf since its Aug. 20 cease-fire with
Iraq, shipping sources say, a sign of easing tensions in the gulf
after eight years of war.
   ``It seems peace has finally come to the waters of the gulf,''
said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Iranian warships have continued interrogating vessels by radio,
demanding to know their cargoes and destinations, but even those
symbolic interceptions are now down to one-third of what they were
immediately after the cease-fire took hold, said the shipping
monitors, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Both countries have reported efforts to reopen ports closed by
the Iran-Iraq war, and Iraq said about a dozen of the 18 vessels
trapped in the the ports of Umm Qasr and Khor al-Zubair since the
start of the war have been able to sail out.
   The shipping monitors said the Iranians have not harassed any
vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf, since they
claimed to have intercepted the Iraqi freighter Khawla as it
entered the waterway hours after cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   After docking at Umm Qasr, the freighter sailed out through
Hormuz without hindrance last month, carrying a cargo of fertilizer.
   Several Iraqi ships have sailed the gulf without interference
since the cease-fire, the official Iraqi News Agency has reported.
   Gulf-based officials of two shipping companies said their
vessels have not encountered any Iranian gunboats in recent weeks
and believe that Tehran has halted the stop-and-search
interceptions.
   Shipping officials reported that traffic in the gulf has not
noticably increased since the cease-fire, while shippers wait to
see what happens.
   During the fighting, Iranian warships and gunboats intercepted
hundreds of vessels entering the gulf through Hormuz to determine
if they were carrying war-related materiel to Iraq. Several were
seized and inspected.
   Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said Oct. 8 that in
an effort to break the deadlock in the peace negotiations Iran has
agreed to drop its ``right to search ships in the Strait of
Hormuz.''
   Officials at the United Nations said that was part of a
compromise proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, who has said he expects the talks to resume in Geneva
sometime during the last week of this month.
   The earlier negotiations in Geneva and New York stalled over
Iraq's demand the Iranians halt ship searches and Iraq's insistence
the Shatt Al-Arab, which forms the southern boundary between the
two countries, be reopened.
   Iran has refused to agree to unblock the waterway, Iraq's
primary outlet to the gulf, until Baghdad concedes that a 1975
treaty drawing the border down the middle of the Shatt Al-Arab,
instead of along the eastern Iranian bank, is still valid.
   Iraqi officials have denied Baghdad has agreed in principle to a
compromise, under which troops would be withdrawn to the pre-war
border and prisoners exchanged within 15 days.
   The Iranians' recent actions have helped make the gulf, through
which one-fifth of the non-communist world's oil supplies pass, a
safer place.
   The two sides attacked nearly 550 merchant vessels in the gulf
during the so-called ``tanker war,'' killing more than 300 seamen.
   U.S., British and other Western warships still patrol the gulf.
But the Americans have halted close-in escorts of convoys of
U.S.-flagged vessels as the danger of Iranian attack has receded.

   A gun-toting lawyer who demanded that
Mexican authorities imprison his brother for cheating his mother
out of her inheritance stormed into the U.S. Consulate on Thursday
and took the consul hostage, officials said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman William Graves said Edwin Culp ``is being
held by a Mexican national. We have notified Mexican authorities
and they have been in touch with the individual who is in Mr.
Culp's office.''
   Culp is not a foreign service officer but is a businessman and a
civilian consular agent serving as consul, Graves said.
   Officials identified the gunman as Francisco Delfin Perez, a
lawyer from Cordoba, which is near Veracruz. They said Culp and
Delfin Perez apparently knew each other.
   Delfin Perez wants his brother and a notary public imprisoned
for allegedly cheating his mother in an inheritance dispute over
stock worth about $347,000, said Alfredo Algarin Vega, subsecretary
of the Veracruz state Interior Ministry.
   Algarin said Delfin Perez' mother, lawyer and a friend have all
talked to Delfin Perez by telephone and urged him to give up.
   The president of the state supreme court and the state attorney
general have assured Delfin Perez' mother, Berta Perez Ferrer, that
they would investigate to see if anything had gone wrong.
   ``Son, I'm fine. There's no problem with the case,'' Algarin
quoted Mrs. Perez Ferrer as telling her son.
   However, said Algarin, Delfin Perez said he wanted to see his
brother Lucio and the notary, who was not identified, in jail.
   ``He wants to see the notary charged on television,'' Algarin
said.
   The building housing the consulate was surrounded by about 50
federal, state and local police officers late Thursday, said Jose
Antonio Herrera, night editor of El Dictamen, but Algarin said the
police were being kept out of sight to avoid antagonizing the
gunman.
   ``We are trying through persuasion'' to get him to give up. ``We
are very worried,'' Algarin said. Algarin said he had spoken to
Delfin Perez for about 40 minutes.
   Algarin said he had offered to give the man a helicopter, but
Delfin Perez said he would not leave and warned authorities ``not
to try to take the building by force because he could take measures
that we would regret.''
   ``His mother told us that Delfin Perez had a cordial
relationship with the consul,'' Algarin said. Algarin had no
further details on that.
   The consular office is located in a building in downtown
Veracruz, and the consulate is in the building's lower floor.
Embassy officials were also on the scene, Graves said.
   A man who answered a telephone call to the consulate identified
himself as Culp and said in a calm voice before he hung up: ``There
is nothing happening right now that we can talk about. There's
nothing that we can talk about. I'd rather not talk right now.''
   Graves described Culp as in his mid-40s, a long-time resident of
Veracruz who owns a restaurant, discotheque and a clothing factory.
   Graves said the Veracruz consular post was created about ten
years ago, but did not know how long Culp had filled the position.
   Veracruz is a port city about 140 miles east of Mexico City on
the Gulf of Mexico.

   Ethnic rebels claimed battlefield
victories and two more political parties came forward in new
challenges to the military government.
   A rebel official said Thursday that ethnic minority Karens
captured several hills the day before on the western bank of the
Moei River that separates Burma and Thailand.
   The latest fighting for the hills began Sept. 26. The Karens,
the strongest armed opponents of the Rangoon government, lost the
area in April 1984 to the Burmese army.
   Several thousand students have fled Rangoon and other cities
seeking refuge and military training from the guerrillas after a
bloody government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Though it has killed at least 450 persons since Gen. Saw Maung
took power Sept. 18, the government has also announced it would
hold general elections in about three months and opened a registry
of political groups.
   Two more political parties registered with the government
Thursday, bringing to 16 the number of officially recognized
groups. Most of the groups oppose the government, but none has said
if it will take part in government-sponsored general elections.
   A retired Burmese ambassador leads the newly registered
Democracy Development Organization, state-owned radio said.
   The Arakan League for Democracy also signed up Thursday. It was
the second ethnic minority group to form an official party after
the Karens announced a Union Karen League on Wednesday.
   Most of the parties are local or regional ones aimed at putting
forward candidates from their own areas.
   Only three movements have nationwide followings: the opposition
National League for Democracy; the Communist-led Democratic Front
for National Reconstruction; and the powerful and still
unregistered National Unity Party, which has wielded authoritarian
power for the past 26 years.
   New political parties have surfaced almost daily. One Western
diplomat suggested this week that the government ``may be
encouraging the formation of these groups in a divide-and-conquer
tactic.''

<TEXT>
   A veteran jockey who had planned to retire at
the end of the year was killed at Belmont Park when his mount broke
a leg and the man fell to the track, where he was kicked in the
face by another horse.
   Mike Venezia, the rider of more than 2,000 winners in more than
21,000 races since 1964, died in the fifth race on Thursday's card,
officials said.
   Robbie Davis, the rider of the other horse, was taken to a
hospital for treatment of shock. Venezia's mount, a 3-year-old
gelding named Mr. Walter K., was humanely killed.
   Venezia, 43, was the first jockey killed at a New York Racing
Association track since March 29, 1982, when Amado Credidio died
after he was thrown over the top of a horse onto the ground and
into the path of several other horses in a race at Aqueduct.
   Venezia's mount broke his right foreleg going down the
backstretch of a 1 1-16 mile allowance race. Venezia attempted to
pull up the gelding, then went off the horse to his left and fell
crosswise on the track, directly in the path of the other horse,
Drums in the Night.
   ``I think he was dead when the (ambulance) technician got to
him,'' Dr. Leo Skolnik, the examining NYRA physician, said. ``He
was apparently kicked in the face. He had no pulse, no respiration
and his pupils were dilated and fixed.
   ``I don't see how a fall to the ground could have sustained this
kind of injury.''
   The last four races of Thursday's card were canceled. Racing was
to resume today and a memorial service was to be held for Venezia,
who had planned to retire at the end of this year.

   The five astronauts who flew the space shuttle
Discovery mission earlier this month have received official heroes'
welcomes and congratulations on Capitol Hill.
   Congress on Thursday also thanked the Discovery crew for the
``great feeling you have given all Americans.''
   In response, flight commander Frederick H. Hauck said the
successful four-day mission was ``tremendous testimony to a very
large team throughout the country.''
   Hauck and his crew _ pilot Richard O. Covey and mission
specialists John M. Lounge, David C. Hilmers and George D. Nelson _
were first greeted by applause from members on the floor of the
House gallery and again before space committees of the House and
Senate.
   The Discovery flight, which began on Sept. 29, was the first
shuttle mission since the shuttle Challenger blew up on liftoff,
killing all seven crew members on Jan. 28, 1986. Extensive
revisions were made in the shuttle program before the Discovery
flight.

<HEAD>Japanese Influence from Investment Scrutinized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan clearly has become a major investor in
foreign countries but it is not clear how much this has increased
its influence in those countries, Congress was told.
   The Japanese are ``well behind'' Britain and the Netherlands as
direct investors in U.S. real estate, buildings and factories,
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Clark told a
Congressional panel Thursday.
   Japanese hold $31 billion worth of such investments in the
United States compared to similar U.S. investments in Japan of
about $18 billion. Clark did not have the figures for British and
Dutch investments in the United States but noted that the total of
U.S. worldwide foreign investments far exceeds those of any other
country.
   Potentially ``more worrisome'' than Japanese direct investments,
Clark said, are Japanese holdings of U.S. Treasury debt, but
``actually one looks at that as a vote of confidence in a safe
place to put your money,'' he added.
   Asked by Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-NY, chairman of the House of
Representatives Asia-Pacific subcommittee if Japan has or might use
its U.S. debt holdings for political influence, Clark replied,
``there hasn't been any movement in or out to try to influence
policy.''

   Security and democracy in the western
hemisphere will be weakened unless action is taken against the
increase in poverty, according to a report prepared for Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and other diplomatic leaders of the
Americas.
   A draft of the report from the Economic and Social Council of
the Organization of American States, made available to reporters
this week in advance of the OAS General Assembly meeting scheduled
in San Salvador on Nov. 14, blamed increased poverty on
``adjustment policies'' adopted in many countries to deal with
Latin America's $415 billion foreign debt.
   It said efforts by Latin American governments to earn hard
currency, which is needed for interest on the debt, and to reduce
government spending ``has resulted in a sudden reduction of a
series of social services which had benefited the poorest sectors,
and a dramatic reduction in public investment to ease the extreme
poverty of the region in the medium term.''
   The report saw encouragement in a recent tendency of some
financial institutions to make distinctions for the benfit of the
poorest people. It did not name the institutions. The statement may
refer to the International Monetary Fund and to the ``Paris club''
of creditor governments which have been taking measures to ease the
debt of the poorest countries.

   Michael Dukakis' finger-jabbing sternness was
gone and George Bush's syntax was uncharacteristically ungarbled.
   What the American viewers saw instead were two fellows who say
they are optimistic about their country, know the sorrow of losing
a child and are committed to certain basic values of American life.
   Occasionally, these rivals even acted nice to one another. They
appeared eager to be courteous, each holding up a hand for silence
when their supporters booed or clapped contrary to the pre-debate
entreaties of the organizers.
   Both candidates went into their second face-to-face debate with
an avowed goal to show how personable they could be.
   Bush said his goal was to show people his heartbeat. Dukakis
adviser Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said his candidate had to
undertake ``a conversation with the American people.''
   From the start of Thursday night's presidential debate on the
UCLA campus, the two candidates appeared to be making that effort _
Bush demonstrating how relaxed he was and Dukakis looking for ways
to show that he cared about people.
   In the affability category, both candidates made strides over
their performances in last month's first debate in North Carolina.
Dukakis, often accused of being grim and robotic, smiled a lot. He
used gestures that were more expansive than his trademark jabbing
thumb.
   Bush mangled his sentences less often than usual.
   He smiled easily and often, showing an ``aw shucks'' attitude.
He clearly took the honors in folksiness.
   Asked about the so-called sleaze factor in the Reagan
administration and whether he would work to ban people from
lobbying government agencies they once worked in, Bush said he
would.
   Then, cocking his head and smiling as if telling a secret, he
added, ``You see, I am one who _ I get kidded by being a little old
fashioned on these things _ but I do believe in public service.''
   The debate was short on the kind of slashing one-liners that
characterized the North Carolina faceoff. The zingers were still
there, but they were repackaged and delivered with a smile.
   When the issue of abortion came up, both took advantage of
opportunities to reveal themselves by talking about their children
who had died. Bush, who rarely discusses the leukemia death of his
young daughter, Robin, told matter-of-factly how he learned the
news.
   ``The doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks
to live,'' he said. After her parents took her to a New York
specialist, ``the child stayed alive for six months and then died.''
   Dukakis said, ``Kitty and I had very much the same kind of
experience the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about 20 minutes
after it was born.''
   But Dukakis went on to say it should be the mother's choice
whether to abort.
   Dukakis answered without visible emotion when asked whether he
would favor the death penalty should his wife be raped and
murdered. He responded negatively, passing over the chance to
personalize the answer or mention his wife.
   And Bush, in response to a question about whether he could think
of anything good to say about his rival, complimented Dukakis for
his pride in his family and Greek heritage.
   Dukakis, in reply, managed to get in a dig about Bush's favorite
label for him, saying that Bush, for once, hadn't used ``the word
liberal or left one time. ``I thank you for that,'' he said.
   He went on to say that there are ``things which all of us
believe in. We may have different approaches. We may think that you
deal with them in different ways. But they're basically American. I
believe in them; George Bush believes in them.''

<HEAD>Scientists: `Killer Bees' Will Be Here Within 1{ Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WESLACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swarms of so-called ``killer bees'' will
reach the United States within 1{ years and they appear to be a
more formidable threat than originally expected, scientists report.
   ``It's going to keep coming at us no matter what we do,''
University of Kansas insect ecologist Orley Taylor said at the
American Bee Research Conference.
   Experts predict that the dreaded Africanized bees making their
way north through Mexico will reach the Brownsville area at the
southern tip of Texas in the early spring of 1990, and possibly
reach California four years later.
   The bees have killed at least 350 people in Central and South
America, Jim Tew, director of the International Beekeeping Program
at Ohio State University's Agricultural Technical Institute, said
earlier this year.
   More than 50 bee experts from as far away as Yugoslavia gathered
in Weslaco, a city on the Mexican border, for the conference, which
concluded Thursday.
   Scientists are trying to determine what substances can be used
to repel the bees, said Anita Collins of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's research office here.
   Collins said one motivation for her research was being chased
for long distances by hundreds of bees while studying them in
Venezuela.
   ``I reached the point where I wanted to say something besides,
`Run like hell,''' she said.
   Scientists and beekeepers have been worried since the accidental
release in 1956 of 20 to 30 swarms of Africanized bees in Brazil.
The bees tend to be more defensive around hives and tend to more
aggressively attack and pursue people than the gentler bees of
European descent raised in the Americas.
   That behavior has brought the popular nickname ``killer bees,''
a term shunned by scientists and beekeepers. The prospect of hordes
of attacking bees inspired a 1978 horror film, ``The Swarm,'' and
comedy skits on ``Saturday Night Live.''
   Scientists had assumed the Africanized bees would become
Europeanized by mating with the gentler variety, and thus lose
their propensity to sting in potentially deadly swarms.
   But in the most surprising finding of the conference,
researchers reported that the dilution of Africanized genes appears
only to be temporary and that the bees' genetic makeup eventually
becomes almost purely Africanized again in the wild swarms that
have spread up through Central America and southeastern Mexico.
   ``This African population is going to reach the U.S. virtually
unchanged,'' Taylor said.
   The bees are spreading at the rate of about 300 miles a year and
are expected to reach Brownsville in March 1990, said Jose Villa of
the Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service in Baton
Rouge, La., and Juan Labougle of the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico.
   Villa said the bees first arrived in the southern Mexican state
of Chiapas two years ago, and should arrive in Tampico within seven
months. Tampico is about 280 miles south of Brownsville.
   Taylor also projected the bees' arrival in south Texas by spring
1990, but said climate, distance and lack of suitable habitat will
delay their arrival in Arizona until about 1993. It would be 1994
before they reached California, he said, adding he is only able to
make ``coarse projections.''
   ``This African population ... is rapidly reproducing and truly
self-sustaining,'' Taylor said.
   Researchers said one way to reduce the Africanized bees'
influence is to kill colonies they have infiltrated.
   But low-income Mexican beekeepers have resisted because they
cannot afford to replace their bees, said Elba Quintero of the
Mexico City office of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service.
   ``That has created quite a problem convincing the beekeepers
that they need to destroy the colonies,'' she said.

   George Bush is quitting the debate game _ and
just when he's hitting his stride.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis was solid and smooth in the debate
finale in Los Angeles, even if his refrain of complaints about
being called a liberal did take on a plaintive air.
   But nothing the Massachusetts governor managed during 90 crucial
minutes on national television is likely to shake the Republican
edge in the public opinion polls. That Bush margin is magnified
when translated into the electoral votes that will select a new
president in 25 days.
   The presidential rivals have heard so much negative reaction to
negative campaigning that they even spoke kindly of each other,
Bush acknowledging that campaigns sometimes do generate more heat
than light.
   Neither man erred or misspoke. Bush seemed more assured and at
ease than in the first debate, on Sept. 25. Dukakis remembered to
be likable. He smiled often and offered, ``I think I'm a reasonably
likable guy.''
   The vice president had slipped on his tongue now and then in the
first debate. Not this time.
   The instant pollsters had given Dukakis the edge last time,
although it didn't translate into support in later surveys. This
time, an ABC News poll rated Bush the winner, 49 percent to 33
percent, with the rest calling it even. A poll by The Los Angeles
Times also gave it to Bush, 47 percent to 26 percent, with the
remainder unsure.
   And that was Dukakis' last chance to get at the vice president,
face to face. He needed a breakthrough, something to turn the
campaign his way. That will be even more difficult to find now, as
the candidates return to their solo campaigns and, almost surely,
to accentuating the negatives about each other.
   In politics, nothing is forever. So the debate produced only one
certainty: that there will be no more.
   ``I will not agree to another debate,'' Bush said, when asked
whether he would meet Dukakis again in order to deal with
complaints that the campaign is trivial, superficial and negative.
   Dukakis wanted at least three debates. He wanted them closer to
election day, and he wanted them wide open, with the candidates
confronting each other directly. The Bush campaign limited the
schedule and set the terms, with the implicit threat that if
Dukakis balked, there wouldn't be any debates at all.
   Ironically, the forum the Bush campaign insisted on limiting now
appears to have worked to the vice president's advantage, although
he went into the dual debates with more to risk. But that's it for
the season.
   ``There will be no more debates,'' Bush said. `` ... We don't
need any more debates ...''
   The rest of the way he will do it alone. Future Dukakis campaign
salvoes will be aimed from a distance. And there is not much time
for any new, potentially telling Democratic campaign themes to take
root and produce the turn Dukakis needs.
   There's no evidence of any such weaponry in the Dukakis arsenal
anyhow. He unveiled nothing new in the surprise-free debate.
Instead, like Bush, he retold old themes. That included a
predictable Bush defense, and a predictable Dukakis attack on Sen.
Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee.
   He accused Bush of changing his tune on such issues as the
environment and Social Security. ``I don't know which George Bush
I'm listening to,'' he said, but it was hardly the kind of punch he
needed.
   Bush spent a good share of his time depicting Dukakis as a
liberal _ too liberal to support the death penalty, to assure a
strong national defense, to be trusted with Supreme Court
appointments.
   Dukakis repeatedly complained about it. ``I don't think these
labels mean a thing,'' he said at one point. ``... Let's stop
labeling each other.''
   At another:
   ``Mr. Bush has used the label `liberal' at least 10 times.''
   And again:
   ``If I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label,
I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want
to give away.''
   It certainly would add up, because Bush will be using it again
and again, all the way to the polls on Nov. 8.

<HEAD>Dukakis Mentions Longview Couple's College Dilemma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The couple whose troubles raising college
money for their daughter were mentioned by Michael Dukakis in the
presidential debate are ``white middle-class Americans who have
been left out,'' says the mother of that 18-year-old student.
   In Thursday night's presidential debate with George Bush,
Dukakis mentioned an unnamed family ``from Longview, Texas _ two
teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman
in college, who's an electrical engineering major, a very bright
student _ and they can't afford to keep that child in college.''
   Having been alerted by Dukakis aides that they might be
mentioned, Bea and Bill Scantlin watched and waited to be
mentioned. Daughter Tracy had the event taped because she was
pledging a sorority.
   A first-year student at Tyler Junior College, Tracy has been
told repeatedly she does not qualify for financial aid. ``My
parents made too much money to get loans,'' she said.
   ``In fact, last week she had an interview with a counselor,''
Mrs. Scantlin said. ``He told her again there was no avenue open
for the middle class.''
   ``There are scholarships available for straight-A students,''
she said. ``She's a B-plus student. We're not low income and we're
not minority. So we're going to just wing it.''
   Eventually Tracy wants to go to Texas A&M, said Mrs. Scantlin,
but ``we're saving money by going to Tyler right now.''
   She estimated that the final cost for Tracy's college education
would be about $25,000 for five years.
   She said the junior college was costing the family about $2,000
per semester, a total that Tracy's part-time job as a secretarial
assistant in the campus' police department won't do much to defray.
   ``I think it's a reflection of the disregard of the needs of the
middle class,'' Mrs. Scantlin said of her family's financial aid
dilemma. ``We found that we were not low income. We were not black,
not Hispanic. We're white middle-class Americans who have been left
out.
   ``Basically, that's what I told Gov. Dukakis because I felt
middle-income America had been callously disregarded,'' Mrs.
Scantlin said, describing the letter she wrote him two weeks ago
praising his student loan repayment program.
   The Dukakis plan that impressed Mrs. Scantlin, called the
Student Tuition and Repayment System, allows students to pay back
college loans through payroll deductions in their working years.
The plan would supplement, not replace, existing federal grants and
loans, at least at the start, Dukakis says. Students would get
STARS loans from banks.
   Bush proposes a tax-free U.S. Savings Bonds program to help
families pay soaring college costs. This would eventually cost the
Treasury $200 million a year. The tax break would be phased out for
families earning $60,000 to $80,000 or above.
   The Scantlins have three other daughters, all of them older than
Tracy. Two went to college, one with federal assistance.

   More than 200 alleged Jamaican gang members were in
custody today as police and federal agents continued sweeps across
the country aimed at breaking up violent drug rings that
authorities blame for 1,400 murders.
   About 435 members of the gangs, or ``posses,'' are being sought
in 20 states, out of an estimated total gang population of 10,000,
said U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``The government has alleged that the Jamaican posses are among
the largest traffickers in crack cocaine, which is aimed especially
at young people,'' the attorney general said in Washington.
   Posse members, known by nicknames like Kong, Storyteller, Stand
Steady and Banana, also are accused of drive-by intimidation
shootings and cold-blooded multiple slayings around the country.
   ``They are known to be involved with over 1,400 drug-related
murders since January 1985, as well as kidnapping, robberies,
assaults, domestic and international gun trafficking, money
laundering and fraud,'' Thornburgh said.
   One of those still being sought was Vivian Blake, an alleged
ringleader of the Shower Posse who has been identified by various
law enforcement officials as the son of a key adviser to former
Jamaican Prime Minister Norman Manley.
   The Shower Posse is one of mre than 40 Jamaican gangs believed
operating in the country.
   A 62-count indictment unsealed Thursday in Miami charged that
Blake and 33 other alleged members of the Shower Posse participated
in cocaine and marijuana smuggling, illegal arms purchases and
racketeering, including nine killings. ``This is the first time
that a Jamaican drug gang has been indicted in the United States as
an enterprise,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Blake, charged with the most serious counts, faces a maximum of
390 years in prison and $15.5 million in fines.
   The indictment accused some of the posse members of
participating in the execution-style slaying of five people at a
Miami apartment in November 1984. One victim was a pregnant woman
found in a praying position as if pleading for her life,
investigators said. She had been shot six times.
   The gangs are known for their elusiveness, changing names and
addresses so often that by the time police learn them, they have
moved and adopted new names, said Joe Vince, an agent for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The posses grew out of gangs formed in the slums of Jamaica and
have carried their activities and bloody feuds to the streets of
the United States in an effort to expand their control of drug
trafficking, officials said.
   ``They get a lot of young men from the ghettos in Kingston to
work for them,'' Vince said. ``They're called `silkies' because the
gang buys them a silk suit. They always carry 9 mm pistols.''
   The arrests, which began Wednesday night, cover 20 states but
were focused in Houston, Miami and New York, said Stephen Higgins,
the bureau's director.
   The indictment also accused posse members of involvement in
another murder in Miami, one in New York City and two in Los
Angeles.
   The murders are elements of racketeering charges; there is no
federal murder charge that would apply, although murder charges
could be brought separately by local authorities.
   The indictment also charged the suspects with the illegal
purchase of weapons in Dayton, Ohio, and of trying to bribe
witnesses in New York to protect the posse from investigation.
   The Shower Posse's principal business was smuggling cocaine and
marijuana from the Bahamas and distributing the drugs in suitcases
to New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Canada and other locations,
authorities allege.
   Two of the Shower Posse's four alleged ringleaders, Errol
Hussing and Tony Bruce, are in custody in New York, Lehtinen said.
Another, Lester Coke, is in jail in Jamaica.
   Coke, a well-known Jamaican contractor who has had a
high-profile role in Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga's
political campaigns, is in jail in Kingston awaiting trial on a
murder charge.
   Federal agents, with state and local police, were making the
latest arrests, which were being coordinated by the Organized Crime
Drug Enforcement Task Force representing half a dozen federal
agencies involved in combating drug trafficking.
   The sweep includes Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago;
Cleveland; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Houston,
Texas; Kansas City; Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles; Miami; New
Orleans; New York; Norfolk, Va.; Philadelphia; Raleigh, N.C.;
Washington; and Martinsburg, W.Va.

<HEAD>Dirtiest, Dreariest Campaign? Not Guilty, Say the Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The verdict from Barry Goldwater, Richard
Nixon and Jimmy Carter was unanimous: The 1988 presidential
campaign has been a discouraging, low-level affair.
   But presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis
defended the conduct of their campaigns in the final debate
Thursday. Bush said the press has been more interested in the polls
than the issues, and Dukakis said he hungered to talk about issues,
not labels such as the ``liberal'' tag which Bush has repeatedly
pinned on him.
   As in nearly every other topic in their debate, Bush and Dukakis
didn't see the issue of negative campaigning in exactly the same
light. They did sound alike in one regard, each suggesting the
other was to blame for the mud-slinging tone of the presidential
campaign.
   ``I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard (by saying)
`He started it.' But take a look at the Democratic convention,''
Bush said.
   ``Do you remember the senator from Boston (Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass.) chanting out there, and the ridicule factor from that lady
from Texas (State Treasurer Anne Richards) that was on there? I
mean, come on. This was just outrageous. But I'll try harder to
keep it on a higher plane,'' Bush said.
   ``And I'm not the one that compared the president of the United
States rotting _ like a dead fish _ from the head down. I didn't do
that,'' Bush said.
   But Dukakis blamed the tone of the campaign on such things as
Bush's visit to a flag factory to revive attention to his criticism
of Dukakis' veto of a Pledge of Allegiance bill and Bush's repeated
description of him as a liberal.
   ``We've heard it again tonight, and I'm not surprised _ the
labels,'' Dukakis said. ``I guess the vice president two or three
times said I was coming from the left. ...This is something
Republicans have used for a long time. They tried it with Franklin
Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.
   ``I don't think these labels mean a thing, and I would hope that
tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign we can have good
solid disagreements on issues,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label
`liberal' at least 10 times. If I had a dollar, George, for every
time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks
for the rich that you want to give away,'' Dukakis needled later.
   Neither Bush nor Dukakis referred directly to the most negative
television commercials the other campaign has been airing in recent
weeks _ Bush's ads on pollution in Boston harbor, or Dukakis' ads
depicting backroom political ``packaging'' of Bush _ but Bush did
cautiously criticize the news media for its role in setting the
tone of the campaign.
   Responding to a question from NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell,
who quoted Nixon's description of the presidential campaign as
``trivial, superficial and inane,'' and Goldwater's complaint that
Bush wasn't discussing the issues, the vice president said it
wasn't that he and Dukakis didn't discuss issues so much as the
press was not reporting them.
   ``I went all across central Illinois and spoke about
agricultural issues, about seven stops,'' Bush said, ``and not one
thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on
agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.
   ``Why? Because you are so interested in a poll that might have
been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about
somebody else,'' Bush said. ``... we put out position paper after
position paper; he puts out position paper after position paper
(which get minimal coverage) ... so I think we can all share, with
respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.''
   Bush did talk about agriculture during his Illinois tour on
Sept. 28, but he also stressed his opposition to the plans of
Dukakis, ``an inexperienced liberal governor'' to beef up the
Internal Revenue Service to collect unpaid taxes.
   ``He wants to squeeze another 35 billion bucks out of the
taxpayers' pockets,'' Bush said.
   During that swing, Bush also noted Democratic reaction to his
attacks on Dukakis' veto of the bill to require public school
teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance,
saying: ``The liberals hate it. They can't stand it. But I am right
and I am with the American people on this ...''

<HEAD>House Functioned As Debtors Prison For Illegal Aliens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than six dozen illegal aliens,
including three tearful children, were found by authorities in a
house that served as a debtors prison for immigrants who could not
pay their smugglers.
   Ninety-one people were discovered in the house when it was
raided by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and 14
were suspected of being the smugglers, authorities said.
   All the aliens were from Mexico and owed from $300 to ``whatever
the market would bear'' to the smugglers, known as coyotes, Tom
Gaines, an assistant district director for the INS, said Thursday.
   Neighbors noticed the coming and going of strangers and numerous
cars at the rental home beginning about three weeks ago, said Donna
Gimondo, who lives next door to the three-bedroom house in this Los
Angeles suburb.
   ``We'd see three or four, as many as five get in a car, and it
would be gone a half an hour and then just the driver would come
back,'' she said.
   She said the household was mostly quiet, ``But on trash days
there would be just this humongous pile of trash outside.''
   Twelve of those arrested were arraigned Wednesday on conspiracy
and illegal immigrant smuggling charges. Two are juveniles and will
be deported, authorities said.
   INS officers raided the home Sunday as part of a four-month
investigation into an alleged alien smuggling ring, Gaines said.
   ``Some of them had just arrived, some had been there a couple of
days,'' he said. ``There were no guns found in the house. ... The
smugglers just had guards at every door. It was plain intimidation
to keep them there.''
   In similar cases, illegal aliens who cannot pay their smugglers
try to get word of their plight and need of money to relatives,
authorities say.
   Ms. Gimondo, who witnessed the raid, said the people in the
house did not try to flee, and she saw only two people in
handcuffs. She saw one family that included a mother, father and
three children.
   ``One kid was 3 to 6 months old and (the mother) had him cuddled
in a blanket,'' she said. ``One was about 2{ to 3 years old and the
oldest was a 4-year-old boy. All were crying.''
   While she thought there may have been as many as 30 people in
the home, ``I was quite shocked ... that there were so many in the
house, and quite relieved that it was cleared up,'' she said.
   Helen Sklar of the National Center of Immigrant Rights in Los
Angeles predicted such situations will continue.
   Her organization has been critical of the INS and immigration
laws, saying they don't address the social problems that make
people desperate enough to try illegal entry into the United States.
   ``The law considers the pull factor and not the push factor,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of the debate Thursday
night in Los Angeles between George Bush and Michael Dukakis.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Dukakis said any promise by Bush not to raise taxes is ``not
worth the paper it's printed on'' because Bush has gone along with
tax increases under the Reagan administration. Bush said the ``way
you kill expansion is to raise taxes'' and in his final statement
added that ``I want to hold the line on taxes.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUPREME COURT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Bush said he would have no ideological litmus test for
appointing Supreme court judges, but ``I don't want to see us going
to a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the bench.''
Dukakis said he has appointed more than 130 people as judges and
when Bush praised President Reagan's appointments to the high court
Dukakis mentioned Robert Bork, critically.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUAYLE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Bush strongly defended his vice presidential running mate, Dan
Quayle, and said ``he could do the job'' if tragedy thrust him into
the Oval Office. Dukakis replied that Bush had said in advance that
the selection would ``tell all...and it sure did.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``We have to have modernization if we're going to negotiate with
the Soviets,'' Bush said. Dukakis said ``military security and
economic security go hand in hand'' and ``there's no way we can
build'' all the weapons systems Bush wants built.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CRIME:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Dukakis unequivocally opposed the death penalty, even when he
was presented with a hypothetical question in which his wife,
Kitty, was depicted as a crime victim. Bush said he supported the
death penalty for heinous crimes and called this a ``big
difference'' with his opponent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Bush talked about the loss of one of his children to leukemia to
answer a question about abortions carried out because the mother
knows the child would otherwise be born with a fatal illness. ``I
don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge
at the time,'' he said. Dukakis said he and Kitty had a child that
died 20 minutes after birth, but he said the question is not what
to do, but ``who makes the decision.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Bush vowed he'd never cut the federal pension program, no matter
what Dukakis said. The Democrat cited Reagan administration efforts
to do just that, and said, ``I'm sure you'll try to do it again.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DIRTY CAMPAIGN:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Bush said Dukakis campaigned as a left-leaning liberal during
the primary campaign and now is showing himself as more moderate.
He also said the highly personal attacks from both sides originated
with the digs at Bush during the Democratic National convention and
Dukakis comment that a fish ``rots from the head first'' in
reference to legal problems among Reagan administration figures.
``It's not labels, it's our vision of America,'' Dukakis said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VISION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``I think this is a great country because we've always wanted to
do better,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I think it's (a question of) whether you share the broad
dreams of the American people,'' Bush said.

   Surrounded by balloons, toys and stuffed
animals, little Jessica McClure has recovered from her tumble into
an abandoned well a year ago today, which began a 58-hour ordeal
that touched millions worldwide.
   ``She's doing beautifully,'' said McClure family spokesman Pete
Snelson. ``She's talking up a storm. Her foot's fine and her
forehead is looking great and she's an active 2{-year-old.''
   Jessica, now 2{, suffered a pressure wound to her forehead and
right foot that required the amputation of her right little toe and
the tip of the big toe.
   ``If she walked without shoes you would notice a difference in
her walk, but not much,'' said orthopedic surgeon Charles Younger,
who performed the amputations after her rescue last Oct. 16.
   Jessica captured the world's attention last year when she cried
for her mother and softly sang nursery rhymes while volunteers
drilled through 22 feet of hard rock to rescue her from the dark,
8-inch-wide well shaft.
   The deluge of letters, get-well cards, balloons and dolls has
long since stopped at Midland Memorial Hospital, where Jessica
spent five weeks recovering.
   ``Everybody adopted that child, whether they were a parent or a
grandparent or someone her age,'' said Kimberly Modisett, director
of volunteers at the hospital.
   The hospital also was inundated with phone calls from people the
world over with tips on how to treat the 18-month-old girl. About
50 doctors, mostly from South America, offered to send leeches,
which they said would increase circulation in Jessica's endangered
foot, said hospital spokeswoman Sue Ristom.
   During the first three weeks, doctors feared they would have to
amputate the entire foot, which was wedged next to the toddler's
head during the ordeal. But after at least six operations and
treatments in a pressurized oxygen tank _ with no leeches _ Jessica
went home less only 1{ toes and with a small scar on her forehead.
   Snelson and Younger said Jessica doesn't appear to remember the
ordeal, and does not suffer from nightmares, fear of the dark or
other phobias.
   Jessica was playing with other children in her aunt's back yard
when somehow she fell down the well, whose shaft had been covered
by a large rock, and became wedged 22 feet underground.
   Volunteers drilled a shaft parallel to the well, their progress
made agonizingly slow because the hard rock dulled even
diamond-tipped drill bits. After two days of drilling, they made a
horizontal shaft just under Jessica and plucked her out.
   During the effort, paramedics blew warm air into the shaft to
keep the girl comfortable, and a television crew lowered a
microphone. At times she cried for her mother, and once she was
heard softly singing ``Winnie-the-Pooh.''
   Jessica's plight distracted the oil-dependent city from its
economic problems as hundreds of volunteers rushed to lend
equipment, drill the rescue shaft and feed journalists and others.
   A group called the Midland Spirit Committee organized a
celebratory parade a few weeks after Jessica's rescue and
commissioned a bronze plaque that Jessica is scheduled to unveil
Saturday at a downtown plaza to thank her rescuers.
   Jessica's parents, Chip and Cissy McClure, both 19, are
recognized just about everywhere they go, Snelson said. ``People
are nice to them, but their privacy was taken away,'' he said.
   The McClures have declined most interview requests.
   The aftermath of Jessica's ordeal was not without controversy.
Some Midlanders complained that the McClures have not divulged the
size of the trust fund for Jessica set up to collect thousands of
unsolicited contributions. And Mayor Carroll Thomas had to mediate
a dispute involving a television movie.
   A group of city officials and a group of volunteers tussled over
the movie rights, which the McClures said they weren't interested
in.
   Thomas, who got both groups to work with producer John Cantor,
said he believed the movie was delayed by the Hollywood
scriptwriters' strike and is being written now.

   A state visit today by President Roh Tae-woo of
South Korea was postponed because of the illness of Emperor
Hirohito, officials said.
   However, the 87-year-old emperor remained in stable condition,
officials at the Imperial Palace said.
   Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has been
bedridden since Sept. 19, when he vomited blood from internal
hemorrhaging. He has suffered since then from repeated bleeding,
and doctors have given him more than 15 pints of blood in
transfusions.
   Domestic news media have said he has cancer, but palace
officials have refused to comment on those reports.
   New media, quoting sources close to palace physicians, said
today his doctors are worried about progressing jaundice and
continued bleeding.
   The foreign ministries of Japan and South Korea announced
separately today that South Korea's president was postponing a
visit scheduled for mid-November in deference to Hirohito's
condition. Talks will be held later to reschedule the visit.
   Hirohito, who has reigned since 1926, remains a symbol of the
state, but he holds no real political power.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds Slightly, Stocks Also Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the yen Friday,
reversing its overnight decline on overseas markets following the
release of worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures. Stock prices
gained slightly.
   The dollar closed at 128.25 yen, up 0.27 yen from Thursday's
close of 127.98 yen. After opening at 127.66 yen, the U.S. currency
moved in a range of 127.60-128.33 yen during the day's trading.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 136.07 points Thursday, closed at
27,306.57, recouping 33.27 points or 0.12 percent.
   The dollar fell at the opening in the wake of the U.S. Commerce
Department's report Thursday that the nation's trade deficit
swelled to $12.2 billion in August, compared with $9.5 billion in
July.
   The dollar's opening was its lowest in Tokyo since June 22, when
it started trading at 126.70 yen.
   But the dollar recovered after market participants covered
short-dollar positions _ the repayment of borrowed dollars that
were bought in speculation the currency would decline further _
ahead of the weekend, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dealer also said traders were reluctant to dump more dollars
due to fears the Bank of Japan will intervene in the market.
   The dollar has fallen a total of 5.52 yen since Tuesday and
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, speaking during a regularly
scheduled press conference, said Japanese monetary authorities
would intervene in the market whenever there are ``violent one-day
movements.''
   But traders said there had been no intervention by the Bank of
Japan so far Friday. The central bank does not publicly comment on
its activities.

<HEAD>Arab Countries Laud Naguib Mahfouz, First Arab Nobel Laureate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the first Arab to
win the Nobel Prize in Literature, is garnering both praise and
criticism in his native land.
   Some said he should have received the award long ago. Others
criticized his support of the 1979 Camp David peace agreement
between Egypt and Israel and his book attacking the late President
Gamal Abdel Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist policies.
   Mahfouz, the first Arab writer to win the award in its 87-year
history, has vividly portrayed poverty in Egypt. The Swedish
Academy honored him in Stockholm Thursday with the 1988 prize for
literature for advancing the art of the novel, a relatively new
genre in Arabic literature.
   One of his books, ``Children of Gebelawi,'' has been banned
since 1959 in his own country because it offended religious
leaders. But the Swedish Academy cited the book as it awarded the
prize, saying,``Different norm systems are confronted with tension
in the description of the conflict between good and evil.''
   Mahfouz, 76, son of a Cairo civil servant, said he was ``very
happy and thankful for the Arab world'' for receiving the award,
worth $390,000 and inevitable royalties and prestige.
   ``I congratulate the Egyptian people that one of its small
people won a big award, (but) it's not too big for Egypt,'' he
said. ``I hope this will be the first step for our literary
generations. We have taken a lot and must now give.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Culture Minister Farouk
Hosni sent Mahfouz congratulating telegrams. In Jerusalem, Israel
Television reported Foreign Minister Shimon Peres also sent Mahfouz
a congratulatory cable.
   Poet Hamid Saeed, secretary-general of the General Federation of
Arab Writers and editor-in-chief of the Iraqi newspaper al-Thawra
in Baghdad, said Mahfouz has long deserved the prize.
   Farouk Mustafa, a professor at the University of Chicago's
Oriental Institute, said: ``He should have won it 20 years ago,
actually. I think the committee was negligent in the first to
ignore the longest literary tradition in the whole world, which is
the Arabic literary tradition.''
   But Fakhri Kawar, one of Jordan's best-known novelists, said he
believed Mahfouz was honored partly because of his relatively
noncritical position toward Israel.
   ``I would like to point out that (Mahfouz's) relationship with
Israel and his writings on Camp David have contributed greatly to
push Zionism and help him win that award,'' Kawar said.
   Nevertheless, Kawar described Mahfoud as ``a great writer, a
giant one. ... He storified Egypt's history in his best sellers,
(which) studied carefully the different walks of life in Egypt.''
   Hosni Frez, president of Jordan's Writers Association, attacked
Mahfouz for opposing Egypt's late president and advocate of Arab
unity, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   ``Not for 1,400 years did we have a single man who was equal to
Nasser, and this man was always against him,'' Frez said.
   In all, Mahfouz's works include 40 novels and collections of
short stories, many of them available in English and other
languages.
   The Nobel prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry and economics
will be announced next week. U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel
Peace Prize, announced Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway.

   When her town's beleaguered fire
department was low on money after a series of suspicious fires,
Helen Coulter helped organize a fund-raiser. Now police suspect her
son of starting some of those fires.
   Lawrence Coulter Jr., 19, a volunteer firefighter and lifelong
Jefferson resident, was arrested Thursday and charged with setting
fire to a vacation home in nearby Dalton on Oct. 3.
   ``He's been arrested at this time on only one charge, but he is
considered a suspect in the problem in Jefferson,'' state police
Cpl. Wayne Fortier said during Coulter's arraignment Thursday.
   The proceedings came within a day of the arraignment of Lance
Lalumiere, 23, who like Coulter worked as a volunteer firefighter
in Jefferson, a sparsely populated town of 850 that has been struck
by 21 arson fires since May.
   Neither man entered a plea at his arraignment. Bail for both was
set at $50,000 apiece.
   The back-to-back arrests stunned the White Mountains community,
whose residents have been living on edge since the fires began in
brush and fields and escalated to buildings. No one has been killed
or seriously injured, although many were left homeless.
   ``I don't want any more surprises. I don't even want to hear
about it,'' said Marie Bond.
   ``I feel like the next shoe is going to fall. What next?'' she
said.
   Bond said Mrs. Coulter was heavily involved in fire department
work. Mrs. Coulter helped organize the Sept. 16 fund-raiser that
raised about $10,000 for the fire department.
   During the arraignment, Mrs. Coulter wept when Lancaster
District Court Judge Paul Donovan would not release her son on his
personal recognizance.
   Police charged Coulter with setting a fire at an unoccupied
vacation home in nearby Dalton. Police said the home had been
broken into and the fire went out on its own.
   Lalumiere, a dishwasher, was charged with setting one fire, on
Aug. 23 at his brother Michael's cabin, and authorities said they
will seek indictments charging him with 15 others.
   Lalumiere reported the fire at the cabin and was there trying to
put it out when firefighters arrived. He had been asked to quit the
fire department earlier in the year when he moved briefly to a
neighboring town.
   The Jefferson blazes began with a grass and brush fires, but
soon included occupied buildings.
   In addition to the 21 fires in Jefferson since May, there have
been at least three suspicious fires in nearby towns _ the one
Coulter is charged with setting and two in August in Lancaster.
   State police Lt. Gary Sloper Sloper said troopers will continue
to patrol Jefferson, which has no police force of its own.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis jousted anew
over the death penalty, Social Security, defense, environment and
the merits of Robert Bork in their final debate of the presidential
campaign.
   Neither gave ground, or broke any, on major issues.
   From Thursday night's first debate question, when Dukakis
reiterated his opposition to the death penalty, even if his wife
Kitty were raped and murdered, to the close when Bush said Dukakis
had his own sleaze to deal with in Massachusetts, both stuck
closely to their standard campaign lines.
   For the Democrat, that meant reiterating his allegation that the
only way Bush can pay for new Pentagon weapons, cutting the capital
gains tax and keeping other promises is to ``raid the Social
Security trust fund.''
   But Bush insisted he ``learned the hard way'' the political
peril of advocating any cuts or changes in Social Security, and ``I
don't want to fool around with it.''
   ``Maybe down the line ... you're going to have to look at it''
in the first or second decade of the next century, he said, but not
on his watch.
   Bush accused Dukakis of raiding his own state's pension fund for
$29 million to balance Massachusetts' 1988 budget. Dukakis denied
the charge and said he was the first governor to move to fully fund
the state's pensions. However, he did recently use that much in
surplus pension funds to help balance the state's accounts.
   On the death penalty, Dukakis said he is convinced there are
better deterrents, and he said his state of Massachusetts boasts
the biggest drop in crime and the lowest homocide rate of any
industrial state.
   But Bush said the death penalty was one of the ``questions of
values'' that separates him from Dukakis. He said capital
punishment is especially needed for cop-killers.
   On taxes, Bush denied that he was misleading the public with his
pledge never to raise taxes. ``I want to keep this expansion going.
I don't want to kill it off,'' he said.
   Dukakis accused Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge ``three times
in the past year.'' He derided Bush's flexible freeze proposal as
an ``economic slurpee,'' but refused to discuss what taxes he would
raise in a bind.
   Dukakis, who has said he would entertain tax increases only as a
last resort, claimed tougher tax collection could bring in up to
$50 billion a year from cheats and scofflaws without overburdening
honest taxpayers.
   Bush, asked to name a single military program he would scrap,
singled out an $850 million heavy truck program that he said had
been forced upon the Pentagon by an influential congressman.
   Bush again depicted Dukakis as a liberal and said ``he ran on
the left in the Democratic primary.'' He also charged the Democrats
started the mud-slinging with their ``personal attacks on me'' at
the Democratic convention.
   Dukakis said he would not rule out modernizing the U.S.
land-based missiles. But he defended his opposition to the
Strategic Defense Initiative and the mobile MX missile. ``There are
limits to what we can spend,'' he said.
   Asked about his links to a Boston group, ``Jobs with Peace,''
that supposedly favors shifting 25 percent of the military budget
to domestic programs, Dukakis at first said ``I don't happen to
share that goal,'' but then added that down the road, after
negotiations with the Soviets, it may be possible to reduce
military outlays.
   Bush defended his support of a Constitutional amendment to
outlaw nearly all abortions, saying adoption, not abortion, is the
alternative for mothers of handicapped children. Dukakis said the
woman ``in the exercise of her own conscience'' should make that
decision.
   Asked if he had a litmus test for who he would appoint to the
Supreme Court, Bush said he would not appoint judges who would
``legislate'' or give the high court a liberal majority. When he
praised President Reagan's appointees as outstanding, Dukakis cited
Robert Bork, the controversial jurist whom the Senate rejected last
fall.
   Bush accused Dukakis of supporting ``supply maintenance or
production controls'' on farmers, and implied Dukakis might impose
a grain embargo on the Soviets as Jimmy Carter once did. Dukakis
said he opposed both that grain embargo and the Reagan
administration's pipeline embargo, and he said the government
already has supply management in the form of crop set-asides.
   Dukakis denied that he regards stronger conventional military
forces as a substitute for the nuclear triad of land-sea-and-air
missiles.
   Asked about the serious production problems at the nucler
weapons plant in Savannah River, S.C., Dukakis said it was
``another example of misplaced priorities'' under the Reagan
administration. It could cost $25 billion to $100 billion to remedy
and ``somebody has to bear the responsibility for this,'' he said.
   Bush shot back that that was the closest Dukakis had ever come
to supporting anything nuclear. He challenged the Democrat to
support construction of a second weapons plant in Idaho, and to
back civilian nuclear generating plants.
   On the so-called ``sleaze'' factor in the Reagan administration,
Bush said Dukakis' own former education secretary is in jail in
Massachusetts on corruption charges, and some scandal-plagued
college presidents ``aren't exactly holier than thou.'' He said
ethics in government isn't a partisan issue, and he promised to
seek tougher laws for both the executive and legislative branches.

<HEAD>She Slaved Over the Questions, But The Candidates Ducked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are two sure ways to find out how many
friends you really have.
   One is to win the lottery.
   The other is to be selected as a presidential debate panelist.
   NBC White House correspondent Andrea Mitchell received her
debate invitation Tuesday, said yes, and then came a duffelbag full
of question suggestions from all her friends and friends she didn't
know she had. They kept coming at her until Thursday night, when
Mitchell and three other reporters sat down in front of George Bush
and Michael Dukakis.
   And once the debate started, the two behind the podium had the
easy part.
   Mitchell was operating on four hours sleep, really needed to
blow her nose with no Kleenex in sight, and, to cap it off, nobody
was answering those wonderful queries she had so slaved over.
   ``This was the toughest thing I've ever been through,'' she said
afterward. ``The candidates had all week to prepare for this. I had
24 hours.''
   For Mitchell, the chance to sit on stage for the last
presidential debate was a career opportunity. Yet in accepting,
Mitchell also plunged herself into the journalist's equivalent of
the lawyer's bar exam: having to prove yourself in the space of six
questions.
   ``These candidates have been asked and have deflected so many
questions these past many months,'' she said. ``It is a challenge
to be original. ... You have to try to think of the questions that
will not elicit the stock answers.''
   Afterward, Tom Brokaw, her anchorman, hugged her saying, ``You
were just great.'' ABC's David Brinkley, in his televised debate
analysis, praised the panel for asking thoughtful questions. And a
Los Angeles policeman came up and asked her for her autograph.
   Still, Mitchell wasn't completely satisfied.
   Going in to the debate, she thought she had built a better
mousetrap. Coming out, she admitted both mice got out alive.
   ``They didn't answer anything,'' she said of Bush and Dukakis.
``I had this terrible letdown because they didn't get off their
program answers....''
   She said she was nervous when the cameras started rolling at
6:02 p.m. Not only was she representing all of the other hundreds
of reporters on the campaign trail, but she was also sitting as a
surrogate for millions of voters.
   ``If you screw up, you've screwed up in front of 70 million
people,'' Mitchell said, ``and you've missed a great opportunity to
help the voters understand the men they are voting for.''
   If Mitchell didn't put enough pressure on herself, an NBC
colleague helped, telling her, ``Don't worry about a thing, kid.
The entire election is hanging in the balance.''
   Mitchell didn't back down, adding a rare moment of confrontation
during the debate when she posed a hypothetical question about the
deficit to Dukakis.
   Dukakis: May I disagree with the premise of your question?
   Mitchell: For the sake of argument, no.

   A car bomb exploded near a Syrian army
checkpoint in a crowded district of Moslem west Beirut Friday,
killing three people and wounding 33, police said.
   Sgt. Mohammed Idriss, a police demolitions expert, said the
green Fiat was rigged with about 110 pounds of explosives. It went
off at 9 a.m. (2 a.m. EDT) during the morning rush hour in the
Tarik Jedideh district.
   A police spokesman said the car was parked near a gas station
within 25 yards of a Syrian army checkpoint.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the three fatalities, burned beyond recognition,
were evacuated by private cars to the nearby Makassed Hospital.
   Local radio stations interrupted their programs to blare appeals
from the Makassed Hospital for urgent blood donations to cope with
the influx of casualties.
   The spokesman said he had no information about casualties among
the Syrian soldiers.
   He said helmeted Syrian troops sealed off the blast site,
allowing only ambulances to enter the area. They fired their AK-47
assault rifles into the air to make way for ambulances in the
crowded district.
   Fire engines, their sirens wailing, raced to the blast scene to
extinguish about 15 blazing cars, the spokesman said.
   He said the car bomb, the 15th in Lebanon this year, also
damaged about five nearby buildings and shattered glass.
   By police count, 112 people were killed and 224 wounded in the
previous car bombings.

<HEAD>Country Recovering From Riots, But Fundamentalist Group Promises
More Unrest</HEAD>

   Shop owners covered shattered windows
with plywood and schools prepared to reopen Saturday as calm
settled on Algeria after a week of bloody rioting.
   Armored vehicles remained on guard at major points throughout
the capital, but other military personnel were pulled off the
streets Thursday to signal the end of a six-day state of emergency
called after unrest left hundreds dead and injured.
   But Islamic fundamentalists, who attempted to gain control of
the riots that began Oct. 4 against a government austerity program,
warned Thursday that demonstrations will resume following prayers
today, the Moslem holy day.
   The government announced schools will re-open Saturday after
having been closed a week. Soccer matches, a popular sport with
Algerian youth, were to resume next week after a two-week
suspension, officials said.
   Government offices, national organizations and state-owned
shops, which suffered heavy damage during the violence, began to
re-open. Some stores, where plywood replaced shattered windows, let
small groups of shoppers in.
   Basic food and consumer goods, previously scarce, re-appeared in
Algerian stores and lines for bread disappeared. People wheeled
home sacks of semolina, recently unobtainable except through the
black market and used to make the North African staple of couscous.
   Butter re-appeared at the subsidized price of about $1.95 a
pound, much lower than its regular price before the revolt.
   The return to near-normalcy followed a quick response by
President Chadli Bendjedid to the demands of youthful rioters
protesting the shortage of goods, the high cost of living and a
government austerity plan.
   On Wednesday, Bendjedid announced Algerians will be asked to
vote Nov. 3 in a referendum to make the prime minister responsible
to the People's National Assembly, Algeria's parliament.
   The president said a second referendum would be held at an
unnamed date on additional political changes ``with a view to
greater democratization of political action'' in Algeria. No
details were provided.
   Bendjedid's proposals were the subject of lively debate
Thursday, with many people saying such reforms would not solve
Algeria's profound economic problems. Others welcomed the proposed
reforms as a chance for Algerians to participate more directly in
the government.
   In a related development, Amnesty International on Thursday
urged Bendjedid to launch an inquiry into the shooting by security
forces of unarmed demonstrators.
   The London-based human rights group said the number of people
killed during the clashes, including children, far exceeded the 176
dead officially listed by the government.
   While no final official total has been released on the number of
deaths, most of which were blamed on inexperienced soldiers firing
into crowds, doctors and police sources say there were about 500
deaths.
   In Paris, exiled Algerian opposition leader Ahmed Ben Bella
estimated 1,000 people have died. Ben Bella, first president of
independent Algeria, was ousted in a 1965 coup.
   Miloud Brahimi, president of Algeria's Human Rights League,
asked the government to release 3,000 demonstrators and agitators
rounded up during the riots who remain in temporary detention
centers.

   One of the scientists who determined the Shroud of
Turin is not Christ's burial cloth predicted there will still be
believers. Church officials said the cloth remains a symbol of
faith.
   Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero announced in Turin on Thursday
that he accepted the results of radiocarbon-dating tests by three
laboratories that determined the shroud was made between 1260 and
1390, not at Christ's death in about 33 A.D.
   What remains a mystery is how the shroud came to bear the image
of what scientists have called a real human form of a whipped and
crucified man.
   Professor Edward Hall, who directed the tests at Oxford
University, called the cloth a forgery.
   ``All we were doing was simply dating it and once you've dated
it you know that it's a forgery,'' he told a news conference
Thursday. ``Undoubtedly there will be some people who will fight
for its genuine nature still, as indeed there are still members of
the Flat Earth Society.''
   Luigi Gonella, scientific adviser to the cardinal, said the
church was particularly angered by claims that since the shroud
dates to medieval times it must be a fake.
   ``Believers will be hurt much more by the comments about the
results than by the results themselves,'' Gonella said.
   ``A forgery means it was made for the specific purpose of
deceiving people. This is possible but there is no proof of that,''
he said. ``It could be a medieval icon. We don't even know how it
was made.''
   Ballestrero stressed that for the Roman Catholic church, the
linen cloth remains a venerated object and a powerful symbol of
faith.
   ``The church believes in the image and not in the history,
because this image of Jesus Christ is very interesting and the
people believe very much in Jesus,'' he told a news conference at
the headquarters of his archdiocese.
   The sheet _ 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide _
bears a faint, yellowish negative image of the front and back of a
man with a thorn mark on the head, lacerations from flogging on the
back, and bruises on the shoulders.
   U.S. scientists who subjected it to rigorous chemical, computer
and photographic analysis in 1981 concluded that it was ``a real
human form of a whipped and crucified man and not the product of an
artist.''

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Alleged Order To Transfer Radical Priest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Thousands of demonstrators danced
and chanted to protest an order by Roman Catholic Church leaders to
transfer a radical priest out of the country.
   Also Thursday, the government said it will close Fort Dimanche,
Haiti's most dreaded prison and a symbol of the repressive Duvalier
regime.
   For three hours Thursday a crowd about 6,000 people, mostly
youths from urban slums, danced and chanted its way from the
charred ruins of the St. Jean Bosco Church to the headquarters of
the Bishops Conference in Pacot, a wealthy hillside suburb. They
dispersed peacefully.
   The church, the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide's parish, was the
scene of an attack Sept. 11 by thugs who killed at least 12 people,
wounded 70 and burned the church.
   Rank-and-file soldiers who ousted ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on
Sept. 17 said they were outraged by the attack and blamed Namphy
and former Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain for masterminding it.
   ``The demonstration is an opportunity for the Haitian people to
make known that (they) will not permit the enemies of democracy to
remove Aristide from the battle for the liberation of the
country,'' the leftist Democratic Unity Confederation, one of the
organizers of the march, said in a communique.
   Aristide, in a statement read by the Catholic-run Radio Soleil,
said Monday that a messenger from Rome brought him a letter
ordering him to leave Haiti by Oct. 17. Stephane Francisque, a
social worker and close friend of Aristide, said the letter ordered
Aristide to report to the parish of Sainte Claire in Montreal.
   The Haitian Bishops Conference on Sunday condemned the radical
wing of the church headed by Aristide for allegedly preaching
``violence and class warfare.''
   Aristide has received two other transfer orders in the past two
years, but both were canceled following public protests. He also
has been the target of several assassination attempts.
   A short communique issued by the army's High Command said orders
were given to shut down Fort Dimanche, located in a marshy area on
the northwest side of the capital, radio stations said. The
communique said soldiers at Fort Dimanche will be transferred to
another unit in Port-au-Prince.
   Former political prisoners and human rights groups in Haiti say
hundreds and possibly thousands of people were tortured to death or
mistreated in the prison under dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who
fled to France in February 1986. Dozens have also disappeared
behind the prison's walls since Duvalier left.
   The commander of Fort Dimanche, Maj. Isidore Pongnon, has denied
he and his men are guilty of human rights violations.

<HEAD>Concern Raised That Vitamin A May Cause Birth Defects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies showing that Accutane, an acne drug
derived from Vitamin A, is as serious a cause of birth defects as
thalidomide have raised concerns that vitamin A itself might cause
birth defects, a researcher says.
   Dr. Edward Lammer of the California Birth Defects Monitoring
Program reported Thursday that Accutane is as hazardous as
thalidomide, causing 40 percent of women to miscarry and 25 percent
to have children with severe birth defects if the women take it
early in pregnancy.
   Thalidomide caused an epidemic of birth defects in Europe in the
late 1950s and early 1960s before it was withdrawn from the market.
   In a separate report earlier in the meeting, Lammer said that
another drug related to Accutane, called Tegison, also appears to
cause birth defects.
   Tegison, or etretinate, made by Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley,
N.J., additionally has the unfortunate ability to remain in the
body for as long as two years after women stop taking it, Lammer
reported.
   ``It poses a risk of birth defects even for people who stop
using it before they conceive,'' he said. The drug is used to treat
psoriasis.
   Both Accutane and Tegison are derivatives of vitamin A. Lammer
said that raises the possibility that vitamin A itself might cause
birth defects.
   That is especially troubling because many multiple vitamin
supplements intended to be taken during pregnancy contain vitamin
A, Lammer said. He said there is little evidence that vitamin A has
any benefits in pregnant women.
   Since Accutane was approved in the United States in late 1982,
it has been linked to cases of miscarriage or birth defects in 25
states, Lammer said.
   In a presentation in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Human Genetics, Lammer reported that
miscarriages occurred in 12 of 30 women studied, or 40 percent.
Major birth defects occurred in 12 of 48 women studied, or 25
percent, he said.
   ``These unusually high risks are comparable to those posed by
the thalidomide exposure,'' Lammer said.
   Dr. Neil Holtzman, a pediatrician and geneticist at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, said, ``I don't think there's any
doubt that it's a real danger.'' He agreed that the risks
associated with thalidomide and Accutane _ also called isotretinoin
_ are comparable.
   Accutane, also made by Hoffmann-La Roche, is now marketed with
strong warnings about the risk of birth defects, and women of
child-bearing age must sign a consent form before it can be
prescribed to them, said Paula Frakes, spokeswoman for Hoffmann-La
Roche.
   Holtzman said existing precautions are not enough. ``I'm not
sure the way the drug is prescribed now is sufficiently
protective,'' he said.
   Lammer said that in some European countries the distribution of
the drug is sharply restricted. A proposal to restrict its
distribution here was not adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, Lammer said.
   Frakes noted that additional requirements have been placed on
doctors and patients when the drug is to be used in women of
child-bearing age. The women must have a pregnancy test before
taking the drug, for example, and must agree to use contraceptives,
Frakes said. The company has offered to pay for the pregnancy test
and for counselling on contraceptive use.
   ``We want to do everything in our power to make sure the drug is
never taken during pregnancy,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Lammer said that the birth defects associated with Accutane
include abnormalities of the brain, the skull and face, the heart
and the thymus gland, which governs the immune system.
   An important difference between Accutane and thalidomide is that
Accutane was known to be a cause of birth defects before it as
approved; thalidomide was not. Furthermore, thalidomide was meant
to be prescribed during pregnancy; Accutane is not.
   Thalidomide, used as a tranquilizer and to control nausea, was
never approved in the United States.

   Jimmy Kirkpatrick says he is hoping his son,
world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, will agree to see him
for the first time in seven years so that he can ``explain about
me.''
   Kirkpatrick, 64, who lives in a Brooklyn housing project with
his wife and three adopted children, said in today's New York Post
that he left Tyson's mother, Lorna Tyson, about 20 years ago, after
he had a heart attack.
   ``When I went into the hospital, things changed,'' he said. ``I
wasn't able to support them. I wasn't able to do the things I
should've. And I couldn't marry her. ... All I remember about Mike
then was that he was a husky baby.''
   He admits that he ``was a little wild back then,'' but says he
became a born-again Christian eight years ago.
   Kirkpatrick says he hasn't seen Tyson, now 22, since his mother
died in 1981.
   ``I'm not going to Mike with my hands out,'' he said. ``I don't
want Mike's money. ... It's not that I wouldn't take it, that I
couldn't use it. But I'd take it only if Mike wanted to give it
out.''

<HEAD>American And Five Ghanaians Convicted Of Parrot Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ACCRA, Ghana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American businessman and five Ghanaians
have been sentenced to jail terms ranging from six months to five
years for trying to smuggle 2,000 rare African gray parrots to the
United States.
   A national public tribunal on Thursday convicted 46-year-old
Darrel Marion Alexander, of La Crescenta, Calif., and Ghanaians
Christian Leslie Mills, Abraham Addoquaye Sackar, Nicholas Kofi
Gyimah, John Ellison Sorboh and Wabi Bello.
   The state claimed Alexander, who was sentenced to nine months'
imprisonment with hard labor, paid the Ghanaians who in turn bribed
various officials for false permits to export the birds.
   Alexander, who owns a company called Exotic Fauna International,
was arrested at Ghana's international airport in June after a
government official discovered the birds packed into 38 crates and
squawking in the hold of an airplane.
   The African gray parrot, which once was common in West African
forests, is noted for its ability to learn quickly to talk.
Excessive trapping of the birds and destruction of their habitat
have made them scarce.
   Their exportation from Ghana is illegal.
   The prosecution claimed the men hired hunters to capture the
parrots, paid off a customs official and forged documents.
   All six of the defendants pleaded innocent when charged Aug. 29.
   Mills later changed his plea to guilty on 21 counts of
conspiracy, forgery, brigery and the attempted illegal exportation
and received the heaviest sentence of five years' imprisonment and
a $22,124 fine. He was threatened with a jail term of 15 years if
he defaults on the fine and also is to surrender to the state
$75,000 dollars he allegedly obtained from Alexander.
   Gyimah was jailed for three years and fined $1,327. Bello, a
wildlife exporter, and Sackar, an airline official, were sentenced
to two years imprisonment and fined $885. Sorboh was sentenced to
six months imprisonment.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Halts Execution of Texas Killer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court justice called off
the execution scheduled today for a man who robbed and murdered a
couple in their home 14 years ago.
   The order by Justice Byron White came about seven hours before
Walter Bell, 34, was to be put to death by injection shortly after
midnight Thursday.
   Asked to describe Bell's reaction, attorney Eden Harrington
replied, ``I wouldn't say `happy' is the word. Obviously, he's
nervous.''
   Defense attorneys turned to the high court after the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans refused earlier Thursday to
halt Bell's execution.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and a federal district judge
turned down a request for a reprieve earlier this week.
   Ms. Harrington, a University of Texas Law School Capital
Punishment Clinic attorney who is helping represent Bell, contended
he should not be executed because he is mentally retarded.
   State attorneys disagreed, insisting the arguments should have
been raised earlier.
   The Supreme Court already has agreed to review another Texas
death-penalty case that challenges the constitutionality of
executing mentally retarded people.
   Bell ranks third in seniority on Texas' 283-inmate death row,
where he has lived for more than 14 years since his conviction in
the deaths of Ferd and Irene Chisum, both 59, during a robbery at
their home.
   At the time of his arrest in 1974, Bell _ one of 13 children in
his family _ said he could neither read nor write and never had any
schooling except for some special education classes in his home
state of Louisiana.
   Chisum owned an appliance store and had fired Bell as an
employee.
   The bodies of Chisum and his wife were found in their bathtub.
Chisum had been stabbed and his wife strangled and raped.
   Bell was arrested after he tried to cash a check from the
Chisums' bank account. Trial testimony showed Mrs. Chisum was
strangled with a towel after being forced to write several checks.
   Bell, who had been training as a heavyweight boxer and was
arrested 10 days before his first scheduled pro fight, has
maintained his innocence. He has said he rejected a plea bargain
that would have resulted in a 15-year prison term.
   Texas leads the nation with 27 executions since the Supreme
Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976.

<HEAD>Banned Western Newspapers Will Soon Show Up At Newsstands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average Soviet citizen soon will be able to
sample a sprinkling of Western newspapers, giving them a rare
glimpse of publications that have been strictly forbidden since the
1920s.
   ``This is just a beginning,'' said Viktor Pukalov, head of
foreign publications for the Soyuzpechat news agents that will sell
the newspapers. ``If the sale goes well, the question of increasing
the purchase of these publications will be raised.''
   The sales have been approved by the Council of Minister, or
Cabinet, the official news agency Tass reported Thursday.
   With the appearance of the International Herald Tribune, Soviets
will discover such foreign notions as ``Doonesbury'' and stock
tables.
   Moscow is the last remaining major capital where the
International Herald Tribune has been sold in hotels but not on the
street, according to Robert Farre, a circulation executive in
Paris, where the newspaper is based. The publication sells 177,000
copies daily in 164 countries.
   The decision is especially significant because the newspapers
will be sold for rubles. Many precious Western products have been
offered for sale in Moscow recently, but only for foreign currency,
which citizens still are forbidden to hold without authorization.
   Tass said increased shipments of Western newspapers began Oct.
1. It said the exact date for public sale has not yet been
determined, but that it will happen ``soon.''
   Prices will vary from about $1.50 to $2 _ more than 20 times the
price of Pravda but only about double the cover price of the
International Herald Tribune.
   The venture will start out with fewer than 1,500 copies of the
International Herald Tribune, West Germany's Die Zeit, the British
newspaper The Guardian, and others to kiosks in republic capitals
across the country, which has a population of nearly 285 million.
   Lee Huebner, publisher of the International Herald Tribune, said
the 250 copies of his newspaper will be sold in hotels and on the
street.
   ``I was surprised and gratified that they were going to sell
them at regular Soviet newsstands,'' Huebner said in a telephone
interview from New York City. ``It is symbolic, but it is an
encouraging symbol and I have hope that it is just the beginning.''
   The Western publication that will enjoy the largest circulation
in the Soviet Union under the plan is Die Zeit, with 500 copies.
Tass said 250 copies of The Guardian will be delivered daily.
   The only Western newspapers readily available on the street are
Communist publications like L'Unita of Rome, the Morning Star of
Great Britain and the People's Daily World of the United States.
   As part of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
or openness, the Soviets stopped jamming broadcasts of the Voice of
America and the British Broadcasting Corp. last year.

<HEAD>Walter Cronkite Resigns From Group Backing Government Use of
English</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS newsman Walter Cronkite resigned from the
advisory board of a group that promotes government use of English
only, and the former White House aide who is the organization's
president says she may follow suit.
   In a letter to U.S. English president Linda Chavez, Cronkite
said he was afraid that an Arizona proposal the group supports
could hurt minorities.
   The letter dated Oct. 6 was released by Cronkite's office in New
York on Thursday.
   Ms. Chavez, a former aide to President Reagan and U.S. Senate
candidate in Maryland, also said she was considering resigning
unless U.S. English chairman John Tanton steps aside due to a
controversy over a 2-year-old memo she termed ``repugnant.''
   In his letter, Cronkite said he regretted not being able to
devote much time to U.S. English, but believed its use of his name
in its campaign for a referendum to make English Arizona's official
language ``has proved embarrassing.'' The measure, Proposition 106,
is on the November ballot.
   Cronkite said he remained opposed to bilingualism, but said he
``cannot favor legislation that could even remotely be interpreted
to restrict the civil rights or the educational opportunities of
our minority population.''
   He asked that his name be removed from U.S. English's letterhead
and other organization material.
   The Arizona measure would change the state constitution to
designate English as the state's official language and forbid state
and local governments from using foreign languages except when
needed to protect safety and health.
   Also exempt are such things as the use of interpreters in
criminal cases and compliance with federally mandated programs such
as multilingual ballots and some bilingual education programs for
children.
   Opponents say the measure would hamper courts, reduce
opportunities for schools to teach English to adults and make it
difficult for state tourism and commerce programs to be marketed
overseas. It would also be impossible for those who speak no
English to have interpreters in civil court proceedings, opponents
contend.
   Backers of Proposition 106 say approval would unify the state,
encourage integration of minorities into the mainstream and save
money.
   Ms. Chavez said she had not spoken with Cronkite, but believed
that Tanton's memo also ``gave him great pause, as it does me.''
   The memo, written while Tanton was participating in an
immigration conference, raised the specter of an America doomed to
racial conflict between a minority of educated, well-off Anglos
outnumbered by uneducated, poor immigrants consisting of other
ethnic and racial groups.
   Tanton added that many of the immigrants would be Catholic and
that could reduce the separation between church and state.
   Tanton's assertions were ``anti-Hispanic and anti-Catholic,''
and fuel the fire for opponents of U.S. English-backed campaigns in
Arizona, Colorado and Florida, Ms. Chavez said Thursday from
Denver, where she was preparing for a debate on a measure U.S.
English backs in Colorado.
   They ``were repugnant, and I have told him so,'' she said. The
board of U.S. English is scheduled to meet this weekend, and
Tanton's future may be on the agenda, she added.
   ``I would recommend, if asked, that he resign,'' she said.
   Ms. Chavez said Tanton's position as chairman was largely
honorary.
   Tanton's political stands first surfaced in 1986 in a Los
Angeles newspaper report on an official English campaign in
California. It resurfaced early this month with reports in Miami
and Phoenix papers detailing the memo.
   Tanton, an opthamologist from Michigan, has insisted he is not a
racist.

   A buoyant Republican George Bush says he's
ready for ``the home stretch'' after a debate performance his camp
is rating as a decisive win.
   ``The vice president cleaned his (Dukakis') clock,'' declared
Bush's campaign chairman, James A. Baker III.
   ``You hit it out of the park,'' running mate Sen. Dan Quayle
told Bush by phone.
   The Republican presidential nominee was more restrained in
words, telling reporters only ``I'm happy with the way it came
out.''
   But that restraint did not extend to gestures as he grinned
broadly and repeatedly poked the air with a double thumbs-up as he
boarded his motorcade to leave the debate site at the University of
California at Los Angeles Thursday night.
   ``I feel good about it,'' Bush added.
   His aides rejoiced in the generally favorable reviews Bush's
second debate had received, including a quick ABC poll that showed
Americans who were surveyed thought he had won by a 49-33 margin. A
Los Angeles Times poll gave Bush the win, 47-27.
   Bush told more than 3,000 cheering supporters at a post-debate
rally: ``Tomorrow, we start the home stretch of this campaign ...
And I believe we can do anything we set our sights on.''
   For the next few days, at least, the campaign's sights will stay
on California _ with its harvest of 47 electoral votes and where
the race is viewed as especially close by both sides.
   Bush was to speak at a mid-day rally in the Los Angeles suburb
of Cerritos, then fly to San Diego for a speech at the University
of California's Scripps Institute.
   On Saturday, he will visit a string of agricultural communities
in the state's Central Valley, a bus motorcade campaign that will
take him to Stockton, Modesto, Merced and Fresno.
   At Thursday's post-debate rally at Loyola Marymount University,
Bush vowed to ``work hard and win'' in California.
   And he asserted that, with a California victory, ``I will be the
next president of the United States.''
   Bush did not comment on his debate performance at the rally,
other than to note that it gave him more of a chance to discuss
``world peace'' issues than did the first debate and to say that he
had continued to stress differences with his opponent.
   However, California Gov. George Deukmejian introduced Bush as
``the heavyweight debate champion of the world.''
   The audience, which included entertainer Zsa Zsa Gabor, actors
Chuck Norris, Jaime Farr, Gabe Kaplan, singer Andy Williams and
tennis player Tracy Austin, roared its support for Bush and saluted
him with a blizzard of confetti.
   Shortly after the debate, Bush received phone calls from both
Quayle and President Reagan, according to Bush spokeswoman Sheila
Tate.
   Reagan told Bush ``you done good,'' Ms. Tate said.
   Baker, Bush's campaign chairman, said Bush came across as
presidential, in control, relaxed and likable in the debate.
   ``It's a clear win for the vice president,'' Baker said. ``The
bottom line is he reinforced his position with voters already
committed to him and he closed the sale with those undecided.''
   Dukakis, by contrast, ``projected a pessimistic view of the
future of this country,'' Baker said.
   As in the first presidential debate, the Bush campaign was quick
to parade officials _ such as Baker _ before reporters to put a
positive ``spin'' on their candidate's performance, just as the
Dukakis camp was doing.
   Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, another member
of the Bush spin patrol, said that ``on the issue of personality,
on the question of likability, he (Dukakis) didn't help himself and
probably, he hurt himself.''
   ``We're very encouraged,'' Darman said.

Driver</HEAD>

   A lawyer for parents of a man
killed in a hit-and-run accident said there is a ``fleeing felon
out there who is laughing'' because a judge refused to force the
driver's attorney to reveal his client's identity.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton on Thursday denied a
motion to force defense attorney Barry Krischer to give the name of
his client on grounds the attorney-client privilege of
confidentiality blocked the disclosure.
   ``The plaintiffs' case has tremendous emotional appeal and it is
difficult to rule against the plaintiffs,'' Poulton said, who
delivered the ruling after weeks of review. ``But I am convinced
the law requires it.''
   Joseph Farish Jr., an attorney for the parents of Mark Baltes,
described the driver as a cat with ``feathers hanging off his
mouth'' following the ruling.
   ``I respect (the judge's) decision,'' Farish said, but he
maintained the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality was
abused when the judge denied his motion to have the driver's
identity revealed.
   ``We have a fleeing felon out there who is laughing at all of
us,'' Farish said.
   The victim's mother, Mildred Baltes, said the family ``will
appeal if we have to to the Supreme Court.''
   ``I feel I must do it, not only for my son, but for victims and
families of victims in the future,'' she said.
   Krischer was approached by the driver the day after the March 9,
1986, accident and was asked to seek a plea bargain arrangement
without revealing his client's name.
   No deal was struck with prosecutors and Baltes' parents, Mildred
and her ex-husband Joseph, filed a $6 million wrongful death civil
suit in February against the unknown driver.
   ``The public has gained from this litigation a greater insight
into, and appreciation of, the importance of the attorney-client
privilege,'' Krischer said on Thursday.
   ``The public can be assured that they can meet with an attorney
and confide in him openly and frankly without fear that their
conversations will be repeated in open court.''
   According to police, Baltes, a 28-year-old electrician, was
intoxicated and quarreled with his fiancee as she drove home from a
night out. Baltes got out of the car and staggered down the road,
and was hit by a car and dragged nearly 60 feet.
   He was pronounced dead at the scene.
   Detectives, using car fragments at the scene and paint chips
found on Baltes' skull, theorized the vehicle was a 1984 or 1985
white Buick Riviera. But hundreds of police interviews and a reward
failed to yield any firm suspects.

   Administrators at six Catholic colleges plan
to fight an attempt by Playboy magazine to recruit women for a
pictorial, but they say many students seem apathetic about ``The
Women of the Big East'' article.
   ``We were shocked to learn that they're planning such a
feature,'' said Martin Healy, a spokesman for St. John's University
in New York. ``We're the largest Catholic university in the United
States and public nudity is against our morals.
   ``They will not be permitted on campus,'' he said Thursday.
   Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeth Norris said the men's magazine
doesn't seek the cooperation of administrators at any of the
colleges it visits. Instead, it advertises its search off-campus
and in student newspapers.
   ``We don't do our interviews on campus. We do them in hotels
that are convenient to the students,'' Ms. Norris said in a
telephone interview from Playboy's Chicago headquarters. ``The
administrations should have no part in this.''
   Scott Donaton, editor of the St. John's student newspaper ``The
Torch,'' said he doubts the paper will editorialize against
Playboy's search.
   Donaton said an article about the pictorial was scrapped at the
last minute when the newspaper's faculty adviser persuaded him to
wait until he heard what the administration thought of the search.
   ``It was our decision to pull it, but we did feel some
pressure,'' he said. Other colleges have the right to endorse or
condemn visits from the men's magazine, Healy said, but Roman
Catholic institutions have a special obligation because of their
religious teachings.
   ``We may communicate with the student body and point out to them
that this would be offensive to everything we stand for,'' he said.
``This really is designed to exploit women and that's another
reason we're unalterably opposed to it.''
   At Seton Hall University in South Orange, spokesman Michael
McGraw said the magazine's representatives would be banned from
campus.
   ``We're not supporting them because it's not consistent with the
teachings of the Catholic church,'' he said. ``We doubt they'll be
very successful here. Most of the students who go to school here
have strong values.''
   Playboy said some women in the feature will appear nude, some
semi-nude and others fully clothed. Magazine officials said they
visited only one Big East school so far _ the private,
non-sectarian University of Pittsburgh, where more than 100 women
were interviewed this week.
   The Rev. J. Donald Monan, president of Boston College, called
Playboy ``symbolic of the exploitation of American women.'' A
spokesman at the Jesuit college said the president's faith in the
students' judgment not to pose for the magazine would be forwarded
to the student body.
   Playboy photographers are scheduled to make their first visit to
a Catholic school Oct. 26, when they go to Providence College in
Rhode Island.
   The Rev. John McGreevy, spokesman for the 3,600-student college,
said he would be surprised if even one student shows up. ``Both men
and women seem incensed about the whole idea,'' he said.
   The other Catholic colleges on the list are Villanova and
Georgetown universities. Also part of the Big East, but with no
religious affilliation, are the University of Connecticut and
Syracuse University.

   Clear skies and light winds brought chilly weather to the
nation's eastern third today as rain fell along much of the West
Coast.
   A high-pressure zone extended from the mid-Atlantic region to
the central Gulf Coast, dropping temperatures into the 30s as far
south as Alabama.
   Forty-three low-temperature records for Oct. 13 were set or tied
Thursday, and several records were snapped today.
   Among the cities marking record lows were Beckley, W.Va., where
it was 27 degrees; Charleston, S.C., 40; Columbia, S.C., 33;
Montgomery, Ala.; Philadelphia, 32; Pittsburgh, 27; and
Williamsport, Pa., 28.
   In the West, scattered showers fell from western Washington
state to California, and heavy showers moved through northern
California.
   Today's forecast called for a few showers along the West Coast
and somewhat inland; scattered snow flurries from northeast New
York state to northern Maine; widely scattered showers across
southern Florida; and clear skies from the Great Plains and the
Mississippi Valley to the Gulf Coast and the Carolinas, with winds
gusty at times in the Plains, upper Mississippi Valley and northern
Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s or 70s across much of
the nation; upper 70s and 80s from central South Dakota to Texas,
and in southern Florida; 80s to mid-90s in the desert Southwest;
40s and 50s in much of New England and the Middle Atlantic States.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 26 degrees
at Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to 82 at Yuma, Ariz.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists held out little hope for
three gray whales trapped by 6-inch-thick arctic ice off the
Alaskan Coast as temperatures plunged and their food supplies ran
low.
   The California gray whales continued to swim several hundred
feet offshore Thursday near Point Barrow, using two holes in the
ice to breathe, said Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist for the
North Slope Borough.
   Carroll, who made an observation flight, estimated the holes
were about 15 by 30 feet, giving the whales barely enough room as
they rose to breathe every four minutes or so. Open water lay more
than four miles away.
   Biologists believed time was running out for the grays as
nighttime temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero,
threatening to shrink the whales' breathing space.
   ``They eat a lot and they have to keep moving,'' Carroll said.
``I'm sure they're going to eat everything that's there before very
long.'' He said the whales eat plankton from the ocean floor.
   The only answer would be an icebreaking ship to free the whales,
Carroll said, but renewed efforts to contact an icebreaker thought
to be in the area failed.
   Biologists believe the whales were migrating from the Beaufort
Sea to their winter grounds off the Mexican coast when they were
trapped.
   Several vessels, including a Coast Guard icebreaker, were
delayed by arctic ice this month and last.
   Greenpeace's Anchorage office received several telephone calls
asking if the organization could help the whales, said chapter
director Cindy Lowry. Protecting whales is one of the group's
best-known causes.
   But Lowry said, ``There's not much we can do. We don't have a
boat.''
   The whales' presence in the Arctic Ocean this far into the fall
is unusual, said Steve Swartz, a marine mammalogist for the Center
for Environmental Education in Washington, D.C.
   Swartz said he did not know of another incident in which
California gray whales have been icebound.
   About two years ago, some 200 beluga whales trapped off the
Siberian Coast were freed by an icebreaker, he said. A blue whale _
the largest animal in the world _ occasionally gets caught in ice
near Newfoundland, he said.

   Literary glasnost is turning a new page in
publishing in the Soviet Union, with the appearance of books
formerly found only ``under the table,'' say organizers of a
superpower book swap.
   The display of 1,000 Soviet books at the Boston Public Library
features everthing from Russian science fiction to ``Dr. Zhivago,''
Boris Pasternak's classic that was banned for many years in the
Soviet Union.
   ``For our country which was closed, so to say, for a long time,
this process has a tremendous influence on the whole population of
the country,'' Evgueny G. Semenikhin, who is traveling with the
display, said Thursday.
   Censorship still exists in the Soviet Union but ``now it's
absolutely incomparable with what it was two to three years ago,''
said Semenikhin, deputy chief of the Soviet State Committee for
Publishing and Printing.
   The committee and the U.S. Information Agency are co-sponsors of
the exchange, with 1,000 U.S. books traveling through the Soviet
Union.
   The display in Boston is called ``The U.S.S.R.: Perestroika and
Glasnost,'' referring to the liberalizing reforms initiated by
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Communist Party general secretary.
   Georgy Ginzburg, an art photographer and publisher also
traveling with the exhibit, pointed to Pasternak's books and other
previously banned novels as tangible evidence of glasnost, or
openness.
   ``They're publishing all of this which was under the table,'' he
said.
   Many notable works, however, remain forbidden, such as Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' the brutal story of life
in Stalinist prison camps. Recent reports, however, have indicated
Soviet journals may begin publishing the works of the Nobel
Prize-winning author, a harsh critic of the Soviet regime.
   Glasnost also has opened doors for many artists, Ginzburg said.
   ``We have a group of artists who used to be considered
non-conformists. Now we're publishing books on these new artists,''
he said.
   Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's
Russian Research Center, called the exchange an interesting
development.
   ``In the old days you would have these exchanges and it would be
mostly propaganda. That's different now, there's some substance,''
he said.
   The U.S. side of the superpower book swap is called
``Many-Booked America'' and is a big success, currently showing in
Minsk, in the central Soviet Union, Semenikhin said.
   He said there are no official visitor tallies, but interest has
been constant at the Soviet exhibit, which opened Tuesday in Boston
after a visit in Washington, D.C. The exhibit makes a final stop in
Los Angeles Oct. 31-Nov. 11.

   A high school student apparently
despondent over being rejected by a girl waved a loaded shotgun at
a teacher and four other students and threatened to kill himself,
then gave up the weapon to the teacher.
   No one was hurt in the incident Thursday morning at Independence
High School, which lasted only about five minutes, said police
spokesman Marshall Downen.
   ``The band teacher actually talked him into giving up the gun.
The student unloaded the weapon and handed the empty gun to the
teacher,'' Downen said.
   The student, identified as Roy H. Rosenboom, 16, was taken to
West Valley Camelback Hospital for evaluation. Downen said he would
be referred to Maricopa County juvenile authorities for
investigation of five counts of endangerment.
   Students said Rosenboom apparently had been rejected by a girl
in his school.
   ``He wanted to kill himself in front of her or kill her with
him,'' said Wendy Petty, 16, a junior at the school.

   Radical students shouting ``Drive out
Yankees'' firebombed a police bus today and wounded 13 officers in
an attack on a U.S. government office in the southern city of
Kwangju, police and U.S. officials said.
   Two of the wounded officers were hurt seriously during the
attack near the U.S. Information Service building in downtown
Kwangju, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. Police said four
students were arrested.
   The embassy statement said fighting broke out in the
mid-afternoon when about 100 protesters began hurling firebombs at
the building, hitting the police bus which had about 30 people
aboard.
   There were no injuries in the center, but a car inside the
compound was destroyed by fire and another was slightly damaged,
the statement said. About 10 windows at the center's library also
were damaged, it said.
   U.S. Embassy officials said seven assailants scaled the center's
roof from inns nearby while police outside fought back protesters.
   ``From there, they hurled Molotov cocktails, steel pipes and
tiles which they ripped from the center roof,'' the officials said.
The protesters also wielded stones.
   The students on the roof also carried a placard that read
``Repeal armistice agreement, conclude peace treaty,'' according to
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. South Korea and North Korea
fought a bloody war in 1950-53, and both sides technically are
still at war, with no peace treaty signed.
   In leaflets and slogans, Yonhap said the students strongly
denounced the United States and demanded the arrest of former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   On Thursday, hundreds of students staged scattered protests in
downtown Kwangju when police blocked the protesters from
approaching the Information Service after they firebombed a local
chapter of the governing Democratic Justice Party.
   The U.S. Information Center in Kwangju has been the target of
frequent attacks by radical students, who demand the withdrawal of
U.S. forces stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
Radicals contend the United States enforced division of the Korean
peninsula.
   In recent weeks, dissidents and radical students have stepped up
an anti-U.S. campaign and called for punishment of the former
president and his family for alleged corruption and brutality.
   Chun has been under parliamentary investigations since he left
office in February at the end of a seven-year term.
   Also today, about 300 students battled riot police after burning
effigies of President Reagan and South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
at Hankook University of Foreign Studies in eastern Seoul.
   The students in Seoul called for removal of U.S. influence on
the Korean peninsula and pelted riot police with scores of
firebombs and rocks. Police responded with barrages of tear gas.
   Several students were seen bleeding in clashes along the gate of
the school, but it was not known immediately how many people were
injured or arrested.

<HEAD>Study Suggests CPR Should Be Dropped For Some Patients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors should explain to the elderly and to
gravely ill patients in the hospital that if their hearts stop,
reviving them with CPR will probably buy them little time and may
be traumatic, researchers say.
   One-third of Americans who die in hospitals undergo
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, at some time. The procedure
is futile for some patients and should be eliminated for them,
research suggests.
   ``The point is, to give informed consent, you need to know what
the outcomes are going to be or the chances are,'' said Dr. George
E. Taffet, who led a study of 399 CPR procedures at a Houston
Veterans Administration Hospital over a one-year period.
   Patients should be informed about their survival chances before
they decide whether to be candidates for the ``physically and
emotionally traumatic procedure,'' Taffet said.
   Of 77 CPR efforts in patients 70 years or older, 24 percent were
successful, but none of the patients lived long enough to leave the
hospital, he and his colleagues reported in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Younger patients were involved in 322 CPR efforts, but outcomes
were poor in patients who had cancer, most of whom had spreading
cancer, and in those with sepsis, or blood infections, the study
found.
   Among the 89 with cancer, CPR succeeded 37 percent of the time,
but none of the patients survived to be discharged, and in the 73
patients with sepsis, CPR worked 45 percent of the time, but only
one patient made it home, the researchers reported.
   ``We want to make absolutely clear we are not recommending CPR
be withheld from all patients over 70. ... Age itself is really
only a marker. It should be a flag to the physician that this
should be discussed with the patient ... before a crisis occurs,''
Taffet said.
   A separate article in the Journal argued in favor of allowing
doctors to withhold CPR for nursing-home patients, without the
patient's or family's consent, if the physician believes the effort
would be futile.
   Dr. Donald J. Murphy of Harvard Medical School in Boston said
doctors should be able to issue do-not-resuscitate orders on their
own authority for patients who are very old, chronically ill or
severely demented.
   He argued that the procedure ``is rarely effective, and in many
cases futile in this population.''
   Most informed patients in long-term care institutions do not
want resuscitation, he said, adding that ``physicians are not
required to provide or discuss useless therapy with patients'' and
``recent court cases support the withholding of useless therapy.''
   Murphy said his experiences with patients support his view. He
said after providing them with detailed information about their
conditions, CPR and the intensive-care experience afterward, 23 of
24 opposed resuscitation.
   But other doctors said the patient should still participate in
the decision.
   ``It's their own life. It's the end of their own life,'' said
Dr. David L. Schiedermayer of the Center for the Study of Bioethics
at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
   ``If they don't get CPR they are going to die. If they do, they
still may die but they may live,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday. ``We don't know. We can't predict 100 percent.''
   The government has estimated that 370,000 to 750,000 hospital
patients undergo CPR annually, Schiedermayer said. No one knows how
much each procedure costs, but equipment, staff time and the
necessary hospital-intensive care afterward would put the figure in
the thousands of dollars, he said.
   CPR performed in the hospital may involve equipment and drugs
not used when the procedure is performed on an emergency basis
outside a hospital.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Centrally Planned Collective Farms to be Leased Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced that
government collective farms will be leased to private individuals
to expand production and curtail massive subsidies.
   Gorbachev said late Thursday that the Soviet leadership will
extend ``to the whole of agriculture'' an experiment that leased
collective farmland to small groups and families who choose their
own crops and keep most of the profits.
   The nation needs ``solid, dependable results, already in the
near future'' for the food supply problem to be eliminated, not
just blunted, he said.
   For decades, the large collective and state farms have been run
like factories, with detailed orders from Moscow on what and when
to plant handed down to the workers on the fields.
   ``We have made them from masters of their land into day
laborers,'' Gorbachev complained in his speech.
   He said farmers must be restored as ``complete masters'' of the
land and paid only for what they can produce to ease the Soviet
Union's decades-long food shortages.
   The Soviet leader's speech to a partial session Wednesday of the
Central Committee and farmers was the first broadcast of any such
meeting. It was edited and broadcast a day late.
   The move was another step to dismantle a 50-year-old system of
centrally controlled farming. Gorbachev did not say if collective
and state farms would be eliminated, but said the continuing
practice of paying them ``unearned money'' was hindering the
leasing program.
   Gorbachev said farm leasing is critical because it offers solid
improvements in productivity.
   By contrast, the Soviet Union has poured much money into
collective and state farms in the past 20 years, with only a
minimal level of production. Capital investment rose 140 percent
during that time but production rose just 41 percent, Gorbachev
said.
   The newspaper Pravda said on the day of the conference that
Soviet agriculture now wastes nearly $100 billion a year.
   Gorbachev, who is also head of the Communist Party, said further
``far-reaching plans'' will be considered at a special meeting on
agriculture to be held by the party's policy-making Central
Committee in February. A new land-use law is being prepared.
   Notably absent from the meeting Wednesday was Yegor Ligachev.
The former ideology chief was bumped to head agriculture in a
Kremlin shake-up two weeks ago in what was widely seen as a
demotion.
   Asked about Ligachev's absence at a news briefing, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Ligachev was on vacation
_ for how long, he did not know.
   ``But that does not mean that when Comrade Ligachev is on leave,
we should not handle agriculture issues,'' Gerasimov said. The
official news agency Tass carried Gerasimov's reply as a separate
story.
   Gorbachev also admitted that he underestimated the difficulties
involved in his drive for perestroika, or restructuring.
   ``We should honestly admit to ourselves that when launching
perestroika, we did not apparently realize all that it entails.''
he said.

<HEAD>U.S.-Funded Airlift Begins Relief Flights in Sudan</HEAD>

   Relief groups have begun flying tons of
U.S.-funded food and medicine into southern towns where thousands
of war refugees, some with no food at all, face starvation,
officials said.
   U.S. officials say anti-government rebels have in the past
attacked civilian planes and truck convoys bringing such supplies.
However, government and U.S. officials hinted that guerrillas had
agreed to let the material pass without interference.
   Asked if organizers of the airlift, which began Thursday, had
contacted the People's Liberation Army about safe conduct for the
flights, a U.N. official said: ``We'd rather not comment on the
issue.''
   When reminded that rebels threatened three weeks ago to shoot
any plane flying in the south, the U.N. official said on condition
of anonymity: ``That was another time. Now it is something else.''
   The government has also resisted past efforts to send supplies
into rebel-held areas. However, it agreed after a meeting between
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi and U.S. officials.
   The U.N. official said this airlift aimed to send 12 planes
daily with supplies to the towns of Mairam, Kadugli, Muglad and
Abyei, where food was reported to have run out Wednesday.
   ``The situation in Abyei is very bad. It's now the rainy season,
and the airport is only a strip of sand and stones. We don't give a
time limit, but we would like to carry out the relief operation as
quickly as possible,'' the U.N. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press.
   The operation is paid for by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, and it also involves U.N. and private relief groups.
   Abyei's population of 10,000 shot up to 40,000 as people in
rural areas fled the fierce fighting to the town's relative safety.
   An AP reporter saw a government report covering the last few
months, which indicates that dozens of people in Abyei have been
dying each week.
   The southern revolt began five years ago, with the mainly
Christian and animist rebels demanding autonomy and administrative
and economic reforms from the Moslem-dominated government in the
north.
   The rebels claim to control 90 percent of the southern
countryside. Fighting has forced more than 820,000 southerners to
flee to army protection in southern towns, northern cities and also
into neighboring Ethiopia.
   The new airlift is the first major foreign civilian relief
effort in two years, since Operation Rainbow, a problem-plagued
U.N. program that finally got off the ground in October 1986.
   A major stumbling block to those efforts was a threat from the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to shoot down relief planes,
claiming the government would use them for military purposes. More
than 70 people died when rebel gunners shot down two planes at that
time.

   Catfish have won the battle of Hyatt Lake,
and one fisherman wants to call out the National Guard.
   After hauling an estimated 32,000 catfish out of the lake,
volunteers on Thursday gave up their plan to use traps and nets to
purge the southwest Oregon lake of the pesky fish.
   ``We just don't have the manpower,'' said Medford angler Jim
Summers. ``We need the National Guard for this.''
   Biologists had warned Summers and others their effort would be
an exercise in futility. But the volunteers said they wanted to do
what they could to reduce the booming brown bullhead catfish
population in the lake about 20 miles east of Ashland.
   Earlier this year, local opposition caused the state Fish and
Wildlife Commission to back off a plan to treat the lake with
poison.
   Summers and several other poison opponents said they would haul
the fish out of the lake themselves using live traps and seine nets.
   The volunteers decided to rethink their plans after working 16
hours Wednesday hauling 5 tons of catfish out of the lake, Summers
said.
   The fish were hauled into the woods by the pickup truckload and
buried, said state fishery biologist Al Smith.
   Smith estimated there are 7.5 million catfish in the lake, so
many that the fish's growth has been stunted, they are feeding on
their young and are crowding out most other fish.
   ``I'm not ready to admit defeat, but I am ready to apologize to
the department,'' said Jim Ross, a Medford angler who joined the
effort. ``They told me it wouldn't work, and I said it would.''

   Beau Mueggenborg, 2, is looking forward to
a parade here Saturday _ but not because he's the grand marshal.
   ``He knows he gets to ride in a convertible in a parade,'' band
booster Regina Alig said Thursday. ``I don't know that he knows he
is being honored.''
   The elementary school teacher said she and other band boosters
had been trying to decide what older, prominent resident should
serve as grand marshal when someone suggested Beau.
   The boy has battled leukemia, and everyone in this town of about
1,000 people northwest of Oklahoma City knows of Beau because of
efforts to raise money for him. The blood cancer has been in
remission for a year.
   The parade down Oklahoma Avenue will consist of three or four
floats, a high school band and an elementary school band. Most of
the children in town will be in costume or ride decorated bicycles
in the event.
   With Beau in the convertible will be his parents, twin sister
and 6-year-old sister.
   The fun doesn't stop there. A carnival to raise money for the
bands will follow.

   School requirements result in most young
Americans getting needed immunizations, but the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control says older Americans at risk for pneumonia and flu
are shirking their shots.
   In its weekly report Thursday, the CDC cited progress in key
areas toward its 1990 goals for childhood immunization.
   The CDC said 97 percent of the children entering kindergarten in
1986 had been immunized against diphtheria, measles, mumps,
whooping cough, paralytic polio, rubella and tetanus. The goal was
95 percent.
   For children 2 and under, the goal was 90 percent immunization
against the same diseases. ``It appears likely that this objective
will not be met,'' the report said.
   It said the incidence of measles among preschoolers indicated
the immunization level in that age group is inadequate.
   CDC figures show mumps in 1987 at the highest level since 1979,
with 12,848 cases. Illinois and Tennessee, with the most cases, did
not enforce preschool mumps immunization until 1987 and 1988,
respectively.
   The report said the 1990 target for reductions in diphtheria and
polio appear to have been met and that there is substantial
progress toward goals for tetanus and rubella.
   ``School is the most forceful instrument we have now to assure
immunization,'' said Phil Horne, program management officer for the
CDC's immunization division. ``But laws differ from state to state.
They are not consistent.''
   He said some states waive some student immunizations on medical
or religious grounds.
   For adults, there is a different problem, he said.
   ``There is a general perception by the adult population that
immunizations are childhood activities,'' Horne said. ``There is a
feeling that if they were immunized as a child, they do not need to
be immunized as adults.''
   He said only about 20 percent of the target population for
influenza vaccines get the needed annual vaccinations and that
about 10 percent of the target group has the one-time-only
pneumonia shot.
   The target groups for both shots, he said, include people over
65 or adults with any debilitating illness.
   Horne said the National Coalition for Adult Immunizations,
formed out of concern over the adult vaccination figures, is trying
to get the word out through volunteer organizations and hopes to
include its pitch with Social Security checks.
   But he said it is difficult to measure success.
   ``With school enterers we can require a statement of proof of
immunization for entry into school,'' he said. ``Most industries
would not require a similar statement, for example, for new
employees.''
   Vaccinations of target groups for hepatitis B, he said, range
from an estimated 5 percent to 40-50 percent, with the high end
including health care professionals such as dentists and people who
handle human blood products.
   The report identified users of illicit injectable drugs and
homosexual men as target populations less likely to be vaccinated.

   Flames and smoke leaped from the broken

Orchestra performed a work symbolizing the resurrection of the
Jewish state.
   The show was staged Thursday night at the foot of the 1,300-foot
mountaintop where Jewish Zealots committed mass suicide rather than
surrender to the Romans. It capped year-long celebrations marking
the 40th anniversary of the rebirth of the Jewish state.
   ``Their refusal to yield became a symbol and legacy of courage
for the state of Israel in its revival,'' President Chaim Herzog
said in a speech before the concert.
   About 4,300 guests, many of whom dressed in tuxedos or formal
gowns, traveled by bus into the Negev desert 100 miles south of
Jerusalem. Tickets ranged from $150 to $950.
   Security was tight, with cars banned from the site and shuttle
buses taking people to the staging area.
   Israeli generals and politicians, including political rivals
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
mixed with 2,800 foreign visitors.
   ``The whole mystique of Masada is beautiful,'' said Janet
Heckler, an elementary school teacher from New York City.
   Zubin Mehta conducted the 120-member orchestra and a choir of
170 in peforming Gustav Mahler's Second Symphony, known as the
``Resurrection.''
   As the music filled the chill night air, light traced the broken
line of ruined fortifications along the top of the mountain,
including pillars from King Herod's palace.
   To recreate the final hours of the two-year siege of Masada,
flame and smoke rose behind the ramparts as part of the
sound-and-light show.
   Later, fireworks burst from the walls and a blue laser tatooed
the menorah candlabra on the moutainside, where the earthern ramp
the Romans used to breach the walls can still be seen.
   The men first cut the throats of their wives and children. Then
10 men were chosen by lot to kill the other men. More lots were
drawn, and one man killed his nine companions and then threw
himself on the sword.
   Actor Gregory Peck, 72, and French entertainer Yves Montand
hosted the program, which included a reading of Roman historian
Josephus Flavius' account of the fall of Masada in 73 A.D. to Roman
legionnaires.
   Yosef Yadin, brother of the late archaeologist Yigal Yadin, who
excavated Masada, read the final speech of Eleazar Ben Yair,
commander of the 1,000 warriors and their families who stood off
15,000 Romans for nearly two years.
   Facing certain defeat, Eleazar called on the survivors to commit
mass suicide and destroy the fortress at Masada, except for its
food store.
   ``It will testify when we are dead that we did not perish
through want but because, in keeping with our intitial resolution,
we chose death to slavery,'' Eleazar is said to have told his
followers.
   The show included an emotional telephone call by violinist Anna
Roznovksy to her sister Lena Kaskuna, a refusenik in Leningrad.
Mehta said Ms. Kaskuna has been unable to emigrate to Israel
because her teen-age son has been drafted into the Soviet military.
   This year's 40th anniversary celebrations were marred by the
10-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands, which led to a
13 percent drop in tourism.
   Israel had hoped the celebrations, which began after the start
of the Jewish new year in September 1987, would bring 1.6 million
tourists. Earnings were projected at $350 million more than in
1987, when 1.5 million tourists brought in $1.5 billion.
   Instead, officials said, only about 1.3 million tourists are
expected by year's end.

<TEXT>
   A letter written to President Reagan by a
schoolgirl asking him to help a girlfriend who was being beaten by
her father took nearly two years to reach the proper authorities,
officials say.
   Delaware County Childrens Services workers were investigating
the letter, mailed Jan. 7, 1987, after it arrived Tuesday via the
White House and the National Center for Missing & Exploited
Children in Washington.
   ``I mean, it sounded pretty serious and we get the letter almost
two years later,'' said Donna Bukovec, a Children's Services social
worker.
   It was sent to Reagan by a girl who was an eighth-grade student
at the time, said Ms. Bukovec. She would not divulge details on the
girl's identity.
   Ms. Bukovec said social workers talked to the girl Thursday and
were trying to determine whether an abuse case still exists. But
Bukovec said she was certain abuse was occuring when the girl wrote
the letter.
   The letter read, in part, ``I've got a friend who is beaten by
her dad. She doesn't want me to say anything but I think she really
needs help. I don't know what I should do. What would you do? She's
really scared of her father and she thinks if I tell someone then
her father will find out and beat her more.
   ``I think you've been a great president. I can't think of anyone
to ask but you. Please write back! I have no one else to turn to,
if you can't help, who can?'' the letter concluded.
   The letter was forwarded to Delaware officials by Elizabeth A.
Braun, an intern at the National Center for Missing & Exploited
Children. In her cover letter, Ms. Braun said the letter was
forwarded to the center from the president's office, asking them to
look into the matter.
   She said the letter was probably misfiled at the center, causing
the delay.
   Another official at the center, Charles Pickett, said the
allegation of child abuse fell outside of matters covered at the
organization since it is a private, non-profit agency that
specializes in tracking down missing and exploited children.
   A White House press office spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the White House's policy is to forward such letters
to social service authorities in the area where the alleged
incidents are occurring.
   It would be impossible to track the letter in question without
knowing who wrote it, he said. He did not explain why the letter
went to the center, but he noted the White House receives about
10,000 pieces of mail daily.

   A South African commando captured
during a raid told Botswana authorities that his government had
ordered him to kill or abduct a black nationalist guerrilla,
according to a court document.
   Johannes Basson, a 25-year-old white South African, said he had
orders from a top-ranking official in the South African
intelligence service to track down a suspected member of the
African National Congress, according to the police statement read
into the record Thursday at Francistown High Court.
   The congress is the main black rebel group fighting the
white-led government of South Africa.
   Basson and another white South African, 30-year-old Theodore
Hermansen, were caught June 20 after a clash in which commandos
injured three unarmed Botswana policemen. Other commandos in the
group escaped.
   Basson and Hermansen have pleaded innocent to attempted murder
and other charges. They could face the death penalty if convicted.
   South Africa has said it sent a uniformed military unit into the
neighboring country on June 20 for an anti-guerrilla mission.
However, it has not commented on Basson and Hermansen, who were
wearing civilian clothes when arrested.

   Fans of strange facts and weird records can get
the latest on the longest, the biggest and the fastest with today's
publication of the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of Records.
   The annual edition is published early each year to catch early
Christmas sales.
   The latest 312-page volume lists milestones in sports, business,
science, nature and the arts. But the items that lure trivia buffs
to the book often fall into the more subjective category of the
bizarre.
   For example, among this year's landmarks are the longest
distance traveled while sleepwalking _ 100 miles. The honor goes to
12-year-old Michael Dixon of Danville, Ill., who hopped a freight
train to Peru, Indiana. He was found barefoot in his pajamas
wandering near a railroad track.
   Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who fell from grace because of
drug abuse at the Olympics, is listed the world's fastest man with
his 100-meter run of his time of 9.83 seconds at the World
Championships in Rome on Aug. 30, 1987.
   World records at the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea, came too late to be included, and will go into the 1990
edition ``subject to them not being beaten,'' said Guinness Book of
Records' sports compiler Stewart Newport.
   However, he said, Johnson's world-record breaking 100-meter win
in Seoul will be reduced to a footnote that reads: ``Ben Johnson
ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds at Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 24,
1988, but was subsequently disqualified on a positive drugs test
for steroids.''
   The book lists the rarest breed of dog as the American hairless
terrier. At the last count in March, 68 of the known 70 specimens
were owned by Willie and Edwin Scott of Trout, La.
   An even rarer species was ``Super Frosty,'' the world's largest
snowman, built over two weeks last spring by a team in Anchorage,
Alaska. The snow giant stood 63.56 feet.
   If musically inclined, Super Frosty would probably want to play
the world's largest _ and presumably loudest _ guitar at 14 feet, 3
inches tall and weighing 309 pounds. It was built by Joe Kovacic of
Ontario, Canada.
   Other bits of information include the oldest sheep, 28 years;
the longest conga dance line, 119,986 people; most hands shaken,
19,592 in eight hours; the best best man, 408 marriages; and the
tallest woman, 7 feet 7 inches.
   The Guinness Book of Records was first compiled in 1955 by twins
Ross and Norris McWhirter as a depository of fact to become the
final arbiter in all arguments. By 1988, worldwide sales had
reached nearly 60 million in 262 editions in 31 languages.

<TEXT>
   Federal attorneys have filed a civil
racketeering lawsuit against alleged Mafia boss Vincent ``Chin''
Gigante, accusing him of controlling Teamsters Local 560 through
mob lieutenants.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday, also names a trucking company and a
lawyer who worked for members of the 8,500-member local, which has
been placed under a trustee by a federal judge.
   It was the first time that Gigante has been targeted by the
government regarding corruption in Local 560.
   However, many of the allegations of control by the Genovese
crime family have surfaced before in the government's legal battle
to wrest control of the union and during recent efforts to stop
previously barred Local 560 officials from regaining office in
elections this fall.
   Earlier this year, an indictment was brought against seven
reputed family members and associates in a business-takeover scheme.
   Another indictment charged trucking company figure Francis J.
Walsh Jr. and other reputed crime family members of arranging a
``sweetheart'' labor deal with officials of the Union City-based
union. Walsh, of Saddle River, has denied the charges.
   The court papers filed Thursday cite the same alleged scheme
involving Walsh as a reason to take action against Gigante.
   ``What we hope is to get an injunction against (Gigante's)
involvement with 560, which the Genovese family has controlled
since the early 1960s,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   The government is seeking to have Gigante barred from directly
or indirectly influencing the affairs of Local 560 or any union.
   Gigante, 60, of Old Tappan could not be reached for comment.
There was no telephone listing under his name and federal
authorities did not know who his attorney was.
   In Cleveland, where a Teamsters international vice president and
a local union official are facing trial, jury selection paused
while a federal judge took up several pre-trial motions.
   The defense has asked Judge George W. White to admit as evidence
statements made in 1985 by two former Cleveland FBI agents.
   The jury selection process begun Wednesday is expected to last
into next week.
   Harold Friedman, 66, is charged with two counts of labor
racketeering, two of embezzlement and two of making false
statements to the Labor Department.
   Friedman is president of the 5,000-member Teamsters Local 507,
an international vice president of the union since 1983, president
of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters and president of Teamsters
Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio. He also is president of Bakery
Workers Local 19 in Cleveland.
   Co-defendant Anthony Hughes, 52, Local 507's recording
secretary, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one
count of embezzlement.
   Until recently, both Friedman and Hughes were overshadowed by
the defense of Jackie Presser, Teamsters president from 1983 until
he died of brain cancer on July 9. Presser was also indicted on
charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement.
   Federal prosecutors have alleged Presser, as secretary-treasurer
of Local 507, masterminded a $700,000 embezzlement scheme.

<HEAD>Government Says It Will Make Changes In Austerity Program</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with easing of austerity program. No

<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced plans to
ease an unpopular austerity program, newspapers reported today, as
leaders tried to battle runaway inflation and to quell social
unrest.
   Over the past several months, street protesters and strikers
have demanded an overhaul of the ruling party hierarchy, and
earlier this month they forced out leaders of Vojvodina, one of the
nation's two autonomous provinces.
   Changes in the program include wage increases for workers in
profitable companies and more funding for hard-pressed social
services, such as health and education. The changes were announced
Thursday by the federal government, Belgrade's state-run dailies
said.
   Austerity measures imposed in May to curb a $21 billion foreign
debt and annual inflation of 217 percent, resulted in hefty wage
cuts and substantial price increases. The changes will be adopted
by Yugoslavia's Parliament by the end of October, the reports said.
   In the first nine months of this year, salaries in Yugoslavia
fell by 25 percent in real terms. They have reached the level of
the mid-1960s in comparative purchasing power, official estimates
say.
   Belgrade newspapers said that the International Monetary Fund
had approved the government's proposed amendments. They gave no
details.
   Today's reports also failed to give the exact increase in
salaries, which now average $100 a month in Yugoslavia.
   Adoption of the unpopular austerity program was a precondition
set by the monetary fund and other Western creditors for
rescheduling payments on Yugoslavia's foreign debt and obtaining
new credits.
   The policy switch follows a government announcement last weekend
of emergency imports to alleviate shortages.
   Worker protests and strikes increased markedly after the May
program took effect, prompting angry crowds to march into
Parliament in July to protest low wages.
   The national Communist Party, under pressure to respond to the
unrest with more effective leadership, has announced plans to make
a series of personnel changes at a meeting of its policy-setting
Central Committee on Monday.
   Party leaders in the troubled province of Kosovo and the poor
southern republic of Montenegro, where major anti-government
protests broke out last weekend, met today to consider their own
personnel changes, the state news agency Tanjug said.
   Kosovo, an autonomous province in Yugoslavia's largest republic
of Serbia, is wrought with tension between the ethnic Albanian
majority, who make up 90 percent of its 2 million people, and a
Slav minority that complains that daily harassment by the Albanians
is driving them out of the region.
   Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Communist party leader, has
spearheaded a Serbian drive for more control over Kosovo and
Serbia's other nominally autonomous province, Vojvodina.
   His push, backed by mass rallies in recent weeks, has launched a
power struggle between Serbia and Communist leaders of Yugoslavia's
other five republics, particularly the northern industrial regions
of Slovenia and Croatia.
   The split broke into the open Thursday when Milosevic clashed
for the first time publicly with national Communist party chief
Stipe Suvar.
   Suvar accused Serbian leaders of not doing enough to stop
attacks by Serbian intellectuals on the late Josip Broz Tito, who
ruled without challenge for 35 years until his death in 1980.
   Milosevic retorted that Serbia had been among the first to
condemn the attacks on Tito, whose legacy is officially sacrosanct
in the party.
   Milosevic's opponents contend he is trying to amend the current
Yugoslav constitution, bequeathed by Tito, in order to gain more
power for Serbia.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will institute an unemployment insurance
program to aid the millions of workers who may lose their jobs as
the nation reforms its inefficient labor system, an official daily
said today.
   The China Daily quoted Labor Minister official Ma Dingchang as
saying enterprises will be required to pay 1 percent of their
payrolls into the fund, and jobless workers will receive relief
payments for up to two years.
   Ma said the system is now being tested in several cities, and
that in Hangzhou, the capital of coastal Zhejiang province, 1,800
unemployed people have already received a total of $32,000 in
benefits.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said on Thursday that the
northeast China industrial city of Shenyang has set up what is
probably China's first unemployment offices. It said people without
work can receive 50 percent to 75 percent of their former wages and
free medical care for a maximum of 24 months.
   The reports said the main reason for unemployment were
bankruptcies of companies, sackings for poor performance and the
decision of workers not to renew labor contracts.
   In 1986, in an attempt to end the lifetime employment system
that has led to overstaffing and low worker motivation, the
government decreed that all newly hired workers in state-owned
factories must sign contracts.
   The China Daily said most of the contracts are for five years,
and that in 1991 many workers will be looking for jobs, increasing
the need for a system to look after the unemployed.
   China for many years refused to acknowledge that unemployment
existed, and referred to the idle as those ``waiting for work.'' It
now puts the unemployment rate at about 2 percent, and Chinese
economists say the nation has 20 million surplus workers out of an
urban work force of 130 million.

   Authorities upset at drug dealing outside
schools ordered sweeps near campuses, and police arrested 83
people, seized 10 firearms including an AK-47 assault rifle and
confiscated 5{ ounces of rock cocaine, or crack.
   ``People are shocked to learn that most heavy drug trafficking
areas in Los Angeles are around our schools,'' District Attorney
Ira Reiner said after Wednesday's sweep of elementary and junior
high school neighborhoods.
   ``What we need is to have our schools be a safe sanctuary for
children, and that's what we in law enforcement are going to do
with what we call zero tolerance.''
   During the sweep, 250 police officers posed as drug buyers near
the schools.
   The youngest person arrested was 14, and Deputy Police Chief
Glenn Levant said a 17-year-old suspect had several adults working
for him.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said 29 of those arrested will be
investigated for violating a federal law against selling illegal
drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. The charge carries a minimum
sentence of one year in prison and a maximum of 40 years.
   Other cases will be investigated by the district attorney, he
said. He estimated that a third of the suspects are gang members.
   The officers went to schools in the downtown, Wilmington,
Sepulveda, Pacoima, El Sereno, Hyde Park and South-Central areas.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer who was holding a U.S. consul
and his secretary at gunpoint surrendered today after a 14-hour
siege, officials said. The man was reportedly upset about a family
dispute over a large inheritance.
   The lawyer seized Edwin Culp and his secretary, Teresa Jesus
Horts, at about 12:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. EDT) Thursday at their office
in downtown Veracruz, U.S. Embassy and Mexican officials said.
   Officials identified the gunman as Francisco Delfin Perez, a
lawyer from Cordoba, near Veracruz. Delfin Perez, who had demanded
that some of his relatives be arrested, ``agreed to talk about his
problems with Mexican government officials,'' said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Bob Hugins.
   Culp and Horts were freed unharmed at about 3:05 a.m. today,
Hugins said.
   It was unknown if the consulate office had a connection to the
inheritance dispute.
   Delfin Perez was arrested and being taken to a detention center
in the state capital of Japapa, where he faced kidnapping charges,
a police spokesman said.
   Alfredo Algarin Vega, assistant secretary of the Veracruz state
Interior Ministry, said Delfin Perez had demanded that his two
brothers, a sister-in-law and a notary be jailed for allegedly
trying to cheat his mother out of a $347,000 inheritance from her
late husband.
   Culp, 46, and Delfin Perez, who is about 48, were apparently
acquainted, Algarin said, but he did not know any specifics except
that the relationship was cordial.
   Authorities negotiated with Delfin Perez throughout the night
while about 50 police surrounded the downtown office building where
the consulate office is located.
   The gunman surrended after a friend persuaded him to give up,
Algarin said.
   Culp and Horts were taken to a hotel to be debriefed by U.S.
Embassy officials, Hugins said. He said the gunman left two pistols
behind in the consulate after surrendering.
   While Culp is not a foreign service officer, he is accredited to
the Mexican government and has diplomatic status, Hugins said. He
has operated the consulate on the bottom floor of a building in
Veracruz, a port city 140 miles east of Mexico City on the Gulf of
Mexico, for at least six years.
   Hugins said Culp is originally from Missouri, although he did
not know the town, and has lived in Mexico for at least 15 years.
   William Graves, the chief U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Delfin
Perez owns a restaurant, a discotheque and a clothing factory.
   Algarin said Delfin Perez's mother, lawyer and a friend all
talked to the gunman by telephone and urged him to surrender.
   A man who answered a telephone call to the consulate during the
siege identified himself as Culp and said in a calm voice before
hanging up: ``There is nothing happening right now that we can talk
about. There's nothing that we can talk about. I'd rather not talk
right now.''

<HEAD>Recent Tests Confirm 1968 AIDS-Like Virus Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent laboratory tests on thawed-out tissue
samples taken from a youth who died almost two decades ago confirm
that he was infected with a virus closely related to or identical
with the AIDS virus, a report today said.
   The authors of the report, which appeared in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said their findings suggest that a
virus related to the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, was introduced to the United States on at least one occasion
before the late 1970s.
   ``The findings raise important implications about the evolution
of the AIDS epidemic in the United States,'' said the report,
written by Dr. Robert F. Garry of the Tulane University School of
Medicine in New Orleans and colleagues.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome was first clinically
diagnosed in the United States in the early 1980s.
   It has been suggested by researchers that the AIDS virus was
imported from Africa to the Caribbean, and from there to the United
States in the late 1970s.
   However, the report said the issue of when HIV was introduced
into the high-risk populations of homosexuals, intravenous drug
users and hemophiliacs in the United States remains unresolved.
   Its authors raise the possibility that a virus related to HIV
may have been present in the United States, Africa, or elsewhere
for several decades.
   The researchers based their conclusions on the case history of a
15-year-old sexually active black youth who was admitted to St.
Louis City Hospital in 1968. He died after being treated for 16
months.
   There have been been previously published reports in the
scientific and popular press about the case because the youth
exhibited several symptoms characteristic of AIDS.
   Using recently developed laboratory tests for the presence of
antibodies specific to HIV, Garry and his colleagues examined serum
and autopsy specimens from the youth, which were frozen in 1969.
   ``It appears likely that the patient from 1968 was infected with
a virus closely related or identical to strains of HIV-1 that are
currently in the United States,'' the report said, citing the test
results.
   HIV-1 is the most prevalent strain of the AIDS virus in the
United States and other countries. A newly isolated type of the
virus, HIV-2, has been found in people living in western Africa.
   ``What is suggested with this new finding is that the virus has
been around a long time,'' said one of the report's co-authors, Dr.
Marlys H. Witte of the University of Arizona College of Medicine,
who helped treat the patient at the St. Louis hospital.
   The authors suggest the AIDS virus may have been present in the
United States and elsewhere for several decades, but the current
epidemic may be the result of genetic changes in the virus or
sociocultural factors involving sexual practices or the number of
sexual partners.
   They said more detailed tests on the autopsy specimens of the
St. Louis teen-ager are needed to compare the virus from the late
1960s with today's HIV strains.
   AIDS destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a
person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers.
There is no known cure.

<HEAD>Judge Says Local Franchise Fee Is Unconstitutional</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling that a franchise
fee assessed by the city against a cable television company is
unconstitutional is a victory for freedom of the press, the
company's lawyer said.
   Such a fee ``puts the government too much in control of the
press,'' Harold Farrow, lawyer for Century Federal, said Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Lynch, in a decision issued
Wednesday, declared that the franchise fee charged by the city of
Palo Alto discriminated against cable operators in violation of
constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression.
   The city argued that the fee, 5 percent of a company's gross
revenue, was justified as rent for use of the city's right-of-way
to place cables.
   Lynch said Pacific Bell, which uses the same right-of-way for
its telephone lines, is not charged any fee as its access is
guaranteed by state law. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is charged only
a 2 percent fee for use of a public right-of-way by the neighboring
city of Atherton, also a defendant in the cable case.
   The 5 percent fee ``is aimed exclusively at cable television
operators engaged in speech protected by the First Amendment,''
Lynch said.
   The judge said the city's legitimate goal of raising money could
have been met by a non-discriminatory fee.
   Jerome Falk, a lawyer for Palo Alto and several neighboring
communities that joined in assessing the franchise fee, said he
believed the ruling was the first in the country in which a
franchise fee was held to be ``straightforwardly and without any
question unconstitutional.'' A federal appeals court in
Philadelphia had ruled to the contrary, he said.

   A general strike called by leaders of the
Palestinian uprising paralyzed the occupied lands today, and Arab
reports said Israeli troops killed one Palestinian and wounded five
in several clashes.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In the West Bank village of Biddya, soldiers today destroyed
five houses and sealed a sixth, the army said.
   The houses belonged to Palestinians arrested in the Oct. 6
shooting death of a village leader who allegedly collaborated with
Israeli authorities.
   In leaflets distrubuted in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city,
the mainstream PLO faction Fatah claimed responsibility for three
slayings of alleged collaborators last month in Nablus and
threatened more such slayings.
   Thousands of people in Nablus gathered in front of homes
demolished by the army two days earlier to punish Palestinians that
authorities accused of killing the three victims, Arab witnesses
said.
   Dozens of masked youths threw rocks and bottles at soldiers, and
troops responded with live ammunition, Arab witnesses said. Three
Palestinians, ages 16, 17 and 21, were shot in their legs, said
officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital.
   In the West Bank village of Kfar Malik, a 22-year-old Arab was
fatally shot in the stomach when troops raiding the village opened
fire on stone-throwing protesters, hospital officials said. A
16-year-old was wounded in the incident, said the officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The fatality brought to 297 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 10-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in lands seized from
Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. Six Israelis also
have died in the unrest.
   In Gaza City, a 22-year-old man was shot in the right thigh with
a plastic bullet after soldiers were stoned, said Arab reports and
hospital officials.
   The army said it was checking each report.
   The army placed curfews on villages, refugee camps and
neighborhoods in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, confining 130,000
Palestinians to their homes.
   Throughout the occupied territories, most businesses were closed
and cars carrying Arab workers to jobs in Israel were stoned.

<HEAD>Gandhi Rules Out Lifting Ban On ``The Satanic Verses''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi today said
he would not lift the ban on ``The Satanic Verses,'' the latest
novel by Salman Rushdie, which was outlawed after Moslems objected
to it.
   The United News of India quoted Gandhi as saying he had not read
the book and would not reply to a letter Rushdie sent to Gandhi
urging that the ban be lifted.
   The prime minister spoke to reporters while touring four flooded
states in northern India.
   Rushdie, 41, is a British citizen of Indian descent and lives in
London. He won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, for his first book, ``Midnight's Children,'' a
broad satire on India after independence. His second novel,
``Shame'' also earned him acclaim.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has been nominated for the Booker Prize,
which is announced Oct. 25.
   On Oct. 5, the Finance Ministry barred importation of the novel
or sale of it within India.
   Moslems, including members of Parliament, said they feared
Moslem militants might use the book to incite riots.
   Rushdie, a non-practicing Moslem, is sharply critical of
religious fundamentalism and makes thinly veiled references in the
book to the prophet Mohammed and the Koran.
   In his letter, which was published on the front pages of major
Indian dailies Thursday, Rushdie accused Gandhi of denying him the
right to free expression at the behest of religious zealots.
   According to UNI, Gandhi told reporters the ban was imposed
because the government believed the book might hurt the feelings of
Moslems, who make up 11 percent of India's 880 million people.
   UNI quoted Gandhi as saying that his government supports press
freedom, but that this does not warrant encroachment on sentiments
of certain communities.
   If writers do not show adequate restraint, he said, the
government must take measures ``which we generally do not want to
take,'' UNI said.
   Indian newspapers have been particularly outspoken in opposing
the ban.
   Even the Times of India, which usually supports the government,
said in an editorial today that the demand for the ban was
unjustified.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published Sept. 22 in Britain and is
scheduled to be published in the United States in February.

<TEXT>
   Members of the University of Mississippi's
all-black Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, whose first attempt at moving
onto Fraternity Row was met with arson, have moved into new
quarters on the previously all-white street.
   With the assistance of about 30 members of white fraternities
with houses already on Fraternity Row, Phi Beta Sigma members moved
furniture into the recently renovated house Thursday.
   ``We didn't expect anything like this,'' said Julius Harris, Phi
Beta Sigma's Ole Miss chapter president. ``We are just elated over
our new house. This is a step forward for race relations and for
the university.''
   Mike Stewart, the university's police chief, said Thursday that
no arrests have been made in connection with the fire two months
ago, but the investigation was continuing.
   The house, which Phi Beta Sigma members had been working on
prior to moving in, was destroyed in the pre-dawn blaze.
Authorities said they found an accelerant in the house, indicating
the fire was deliberately set.
   After the fire, the university's Interfraternity Council
established a fund drive to raise $20,000 to renovate another house
for Phi Beta Sigma. So far, $14,000 has been raised.
   University spokesman Ed Meek said Ole Miss had the house
renovated and the fraternity would reimburse the institution from
the fund drive.

   Switzerland, France and Denmark have the highest
rates of AIDS cases in Europe, according to a World Health
Organization survey published today.
   But the Swiss rate of 76.1 case per million population seems
dwarfed by the rate of 286 cases per million in the United States,
which was also listed in the survey.
   The rate of incidence for France was 75.7 and for Denmark, 57.3.
Among other high rates in the 30-country survey were Spain with
37.7, Belgium, 37.2, Netherlands, 36.9, Italy, 36.5, West Germany,
36.5 and Britain, 28.1.
   In Europe, AIDS appeared to spread fastest in Spain with 1,471
cases reported in June, almost three times the number registered in
June of 1987.
   The European total of 14,299 cases included 356 children under
the age of 16. Males made up 88.3 percent of the total, homosexuals
55.1 percent of all adult cases and users of intravenous drugs 23.1
percent. Heterosexual contacts accounted for 7.5 percent of the
total, according to the survey.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Outline Missile Launcher Destruction Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials today
outlined their plans for destroying Pershing 2 nuclear missile
launchers under the terms of the superpower missile treaty.
   Destruction of the first nine launchers starts Oct. 19 at a U.S.
Army site in the Hausen section of northwest Frankfurt.
   Pershing 2 launchers were designed to both transport and fire
the intermediate-range nuclear rockets.
   The launchers are trailers with two large metal beams on either
side, connected by a circular ring that holds the missile in place
in the event it is raised from a horizontal position for firing.
   Chief Warrant Officer Richard Moore told reporters invited to
attend a briefing at the site that work crews will use
sophisticated welding-like devices and saws to destroy the
launchers.
   As a safety precaution, Moore said, the crews will wear
protective welding suits, welding helmets, safety glasses, leather
gloves and safety shoes when the destruction takes place. Moore is
a supervisor at the Hausen site.
   Soviet experts will observe the work under the terms of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty signed in December, said
site commander Christopher Evans.
   All 114 of the launchers in West Germany will be destroyed at
Hausen over the course of the next three years, Evans said. He said
the missiles themselves are being taken back to the United States
under the terms of the treaty.
   The INF accord provides for the elimination of all
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.

<TEXT>
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini today
called Parliament to meet in Moslem west Beirut next week to renew
his term or to elect a new speaker.
   Christian deputies who have boycotted previous Parliament
sessions in Syrian-policed west Beirut had no immediate reaction to
Husseini's call for a session on Tuesday.
   Husseini's one-year term expires Oct. 15. Parliament's bylaws
require that a new speaker be elected on the first Tuesday after
the previous term expires.
   Parliament has failed three times since Aug. 18 to convene and
elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term
expired Sept. 22.
   Twenty-seven Christian legislators have boycotted Parliament,
preventing the 76-member body from reaching the 51-member quorum
needed to elect a new president. They said they wanted to prevent
the election of a pro-Syrian candidate.
   The deadlock has led to the formation of rival Christian and
Moslem cabinets.
   Gemayel has appointed army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a
Maronite Catholic, to head an interim military cabinet.
   The appointment violated an unwritten national covenant dating
to independence from France in 1943 requiring the prime minister to
be a Sunni Moslem, the president a Maronite and the house speaker a
Shiite Moslem.
   Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem leaders have rejected Aoun's
appointment and declared support for acting Sunni Prime Minister
Salim Hoss' five-man cabinet, which governed during Gemayel's term.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen police officers have been indicted on
federal charges alleging they accepted bribes from suspected drug
dealers, gambling ring operators, pimps and others in return for
protection, officials say.
   The officers were snared in an undercover sting run by the FBI
and the Police Department's internal affairs division, U.S.
Attorney Anton Valukas said Thursday.
   ``The investigation, which merged the investigative resources of
the Chicago Police Department and the FBI, should serve as another
reminder that corruption of law enforcement agents simply will not
be tolerated,'' Valukas said.
   In exchange for bribes, the police _ 10 patrol officers and two
sergeants _ allegedly warned the pushers and gamblers about planned
raids, and selectively enforced the law against their competitors
in those illegal trades, the indictment charges.
   The officers are charged with racketeering and racketeering
conspiracy, as are 21 alleged narcotics dealers and gamblers who
paid bribes totaling more than $160,000, Valukas said.
   Valukas said the FBI set up the sting using an apartment
equipped with hidden cameras and microphones after two police
officers told federal authorities they had been offered bribes.
   Police Officer Cynthia White posed as a corrupt patrolwoman and
accepted payoffs from January 1986 to September 1987, and
distributed the money to the accused officers, Valukas said.
   ``When the opportunity to infiltrate a payoff conspiracy
developed, Officer White stepped forward. For 19 months, she played
the demanding and dangerous undercover role of a cop who was
receiving and distributing payoff money,'' Valukas said.
   Cmdr. Mardren Johnson, who is in charge of the South Side
district in which the indicted police worked, also worked
undercover for the FBI, Valukas said.
   The 12 officers were reassigned to administrative chores while
the charges are pending, said department spokeswoman Tina Vicini.
   If convicted, the officers each face a maximum of 40 years in
prison and a $500,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   A former associate of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche has begun serving a three-year conspiracy sentence after
he was arrested and charged with violating bail by illegally
possessing six handguns.
   Roy Frankhauser, convicted last year in the LaRouche conspiracy
case, was ordered Thursday to begin serving the sentence by U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Keeton.
   The order came after federal prosecutors charged Frankhauser
violated terms of his release when he was arrested by FBI agents
last week at a house where six guns were stored.
   Federal prosecutors also said Frankhauser beat his girlfriend
and elderly mother, and left Pennsylvania twice to attend Ku Klux
Klan rallies. However, those allegations were not cited by Keeton
in revoking bail.
   Frankhauser, 49, of Reading, Pa., was escorted out of court by
U.S. marshals and was being held until assignment to a federal
prison.
   He had been free on bail pending appeal of his conviction last
December of conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury
investigation into allegations that LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign raised more than $2 million through credit card and loan
fraud.
   Frankhauser, a former member of the KKK and the American Nazi
Party, was a LaRouche security consultant for seven years until he
left in late 1986, about the time the first indictment in the
LaRouche case was returned.
   He was arrested at the home of his girlfriend, Anne Traczyk, in
Reading, where he had been staying for several months, after the
woman told the FBI he had ``beat her about the face and back, and
then placed a gun against her head and told her, `I'm going to kill
you,''' according to court documents.
   Under the terms of his release, Frankhauser was barred by Keeton
from possessing any guns or being in a house where guns were kept,
and from traveling outside Reading. He was arrested on charges of
being a convicted felon illegally possessing a firearm.
   In court documents, federal prosecutors charged that Frankhauser
crossed state lines at least twice since his February sentencing to
attend KKK meetings and rallies in Maryland and was armed each time.
   The FBI found two handguns _ a fully loaded .38-caliber with a
two-inch barrel and a replica of a German-made weapon _ in
Traczyk's house, according to the documents. Three more handguns
and a rifle were found in a locked metal box opened after
authorities obtained a search warrant.
   Uniforms bearing Nazi emblems, knives, brass knuckles,
ceremonial swords and .22-caliber ammunition also were found in the
house, the documents said.
   Traczyk also told the FBI that Frankhauser ``physically and
verbally assaulted his elderly mother,'' the papers said. At the
time of his sentencing, Franhauser pleaded for leniency, saying he
had to care for his mother and planned to get married.
   Frankhauser was the first defendant in the complex LaRouche
fraud and conspiracy case, and was tried separately because his
defense was to accuse LaRouche of a coverup.
   Testimony during Frankhauser's trial indicated he advised
LaRouche to order fund-raisers to leave the country, burn documents
and refuse to cooperate with investigators. Attorneys claimed
LaRouche workers thought Frankhauser was working for the CIA.
   Frankhauser was convicted in connection with a school bus
bombing in Pontiac, Mich., in the 1970s. He also has served as a
government informant, working closely with the FBI.
   A new trial of LaRouche, six aides and five political
organizations is scheduled to begin in January after the first case
ended in a mistrial in May. Three other defendants are fugitives.
   LaRouche, who has accused world leaders of being Soviet agents
and who is running for president for a fourth time, is charged with
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with
investigators.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested a man suspected of being the
``Black Baron,'' a pilot who evaded them for months while making
low-level nighttime flights over the capital, reports said today.
   The Air and Border Police arrested Albert Maltret, 53, when he
landed Thursday at Saint-Cyr, a private airfield in a Paris suburb,
the French news agency, Agence-France Presse, reported.
   Maltret was convicted in 1986 of landing a small plane on the
Champs Elysee, which at the time was temporarily closed to traffic
for the filming of a feature-length movie. He was fined $3,300 and
his pilot's license was suspended.
   Low-level flights over Paris are illegal. For months the pilot
stumped police, who could not identify the plane or even be certain
it wasthe same pilot each time. On Aug. 13, police helicopters
chased the plane but were unable to catch it.
   The French media called the pilot the Black Baron, a play on the
World War I flying ace, the Red Baron.
   Today, police staked out airports around Paris after being
alerted that Maltret left his home to make another illegal flight.
Authorities arrived at Saint-Cyr moments after Maltret's plane took
off. About seven minutes later, a plane was spotted making a low
pass over the Champs Elysees.
   Police arrested Maltret immediately after he landed his rented
Rallye MS 880 Morane-Saulnier plane. Maltret had recently been
granted an amnesty that allowed him to recover his pilot's license.
   In early September, a masked pilot callling himself the Black
Baron was interviewed on French television about his aerial
exploits.

<HEAD>Du Pont Says Controversy Unrelated To SRP Manager's Departure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The general manager of the Savannah River
Plant is leaving, but his departure has no connection with safety
problems at the nuclear weapons fuel plant, a spokesman for Du Pont
says.
   John T. Granaghan is taking a leave of absence, pending his
retirement after 38 years with Du Pont, because of medical reasons,
spokesman Jim Felder said Thursday. Du Pont operates Savannah River
for the Department of Energy.
   ``It's a personal matter. Mr. Granaghan had surgery earlier this
year,'' Felder said.
   Concerns about safety at the plant arose dramatically at a
congressional hearing last month when a list of what Du Pont
considered the 30 most serious reactor incidents at the 38-year-old
plant was made public.
   SRP's three reactors were reduced to half power last year when
experts questioned whether the emergency cooling system could
handle a problem at full power.
   Since April, all three reactors have been shut down entirely for
maintenance and testing amid additional safety questions. One
reactor was restarted for less than a week in August.
   When it was shut down, SRP was the sole producer of radioactive
tritium and plutonium used in nuclear weapons. The only other
producer, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, has
been shut down for more than a year. The Rocky Flats plutonium
processing plant near Denver also is closed.
   Meanwhile, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
criticized the Reagan administration's record in dealing with
problems at Savannah River.
   Dukakis said in a statement Thursday that President Reagan and
Vice President George Bush, his opponent, have ``ignored the
serious safety and environmental problems at our nuclear production
facilities.''
   Bush agreed that Savannah River ``needs to be made more safe.''
   Westinghouse Electric Co. is scheduled to assume operation of
the plant on April 1, and company officials say they are planning
for what should be an orderly transition.
   Westinghouse executives have met with officials from the federal
Department of Energy and Du Pont in Washington concerning plans to
restart SRP's reactors.
   ``We still don't run the reactors, but we have a lot of advice
and counsel. ... We're going to be living with them, whatever's
done,'' said Westinghouse spokesman Jack Herrmann.

<HEAD>Except For Dollar, Markets React Calmly To Trade Report</HEAD>

   Government reports today on wholesale prices, retail sales and
industrial production presented a picture of moderate inflation and
economic growth.
   The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in September, the
weakest performance in seven months.
   However, that weakness was almost entirely attributable to the
good news that summer's heat had passed, causing a large drop in
utility production.
   Prices at the wholesale level rose a 0.4 percent in September as
the biggest gasoline price decline since January offset a sharp
rise in food prices caused by the summer drought, according to the
Labor Department.
   Food prices rose 1.2 percent, but energy prices fell 3.3 percent
because of a battle among oil-producing nations over production
quotas, department analysts said.
   Retail sales fell an unexpected 0.4 percent in September, the
Commerce Department said. It was the second consecutive monthly
drop and the first back-to-back decline since September-October
1987.
   The decline in retail sales indicated consumer demand is slowing
down, and that should ease inflationary pressures.
   The nation's trade deficit widened in August as it did in the
same month one year earlier, but this time the report did not
trigger a sharp drop in the stock market like the one that preceded
last year's Oct. 19 collapse.
   The Commerce Department reported on Thursday a $12.2 billion
merchandise trade deficit for August, up sharply from a $9.5
billion deficit in July and higher than analyst predictions of
about $11.3 billion.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 7.12 points
to 2,133.36. Bond prices, which fell sharply immediately after the
news, finished the day only slightly lower.
   The wider-than-expected August 1987 trade gap triggered a
95-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average just days before
the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   On Thursday, the dollar fell following the trade report,
continuing a string of declines this week.
   ``The market's still not totally sure about it ... (but) the
first reaction is, we've got to sell the dollar,'' said Rimmer de
Vries, chief economist of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
   By late in the day, the dollar was down to less than 127.5
Japanese yen and 1.82 West German marks, compared to more than 129
yen and 1.83 marks on Wednesday.
   Hopes for big reductions in the trade deficit had helped push
the dollar higher through June, July and August. The dollar peaked
around Sept. 1, then drifted slowly downward before falling steeply
this week toward its level of early summer.
   Some analysts said Thursday they believed the underlying trend
in the dollar still was for a stable or higher currency.
   ``This is not a sufficiently bad number to change the
psychology,'' said Lawrence Krohn, senior economist for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Dollar traders and speculators have plenty of room to interpret
the latest trade figures because economists have sharply
conflicting projections for how much the trade deficit will shrink
in coming years.
   De Vries said the dollar's decline is needed because it will
make U.S. goods more competitive in world markets and help shrink
the trade deficit.

<TEXT>
   James Earl Ray's wife says their
marriage is breaking up because of a disagreement over a book he is
writing.
   Anna Sandhu Ray said her husband has informed her that she would
not get any profits from the planned book, which claims that the
FBI was responsible for the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
   Mrs. Ray, who spoke on the couple's 10th anniversary Thursday,
said she plans to seek a divorce. ``He agreed that that might be
the best thing for me to do,'' Mrs. Ray said.
   Ray, 60, was sentenced to 99 years in prison in 1969 when he
pleaded guilty to shooting the civil rights leader the year before
in Memphis.
   Now in Brushy Mountain State Prison in East Tennessee, Ray has
since repeatedly denied his guilt and sought a new trial.
   Mrs. Ray, 42, said Thursday she still believes her husband is
innocent.
   ``I'm not saying he's incapable of murder or anything like
that,'' she said. ``... I think the truth is he really didn't do
it.''
   Mrs. Ray said she decided to divorce Ray after he told her she
was being ``cut out'' of any participation in or profits from a
book Ray is writing. The book contends that the FBI conspired to
kill King.
   Mrs. Ray said her own theory is that the Soviet government
instigated the assassination.
   She said divorce papers will be filed after she learns more
about the book project. ``A lot of the book is written about me,
and has my drawings in it and my picture,'' she said.
   Mrs. Ray, who lives in White House, said she has retained a
lawyer there, Harold H. Cole. Cole said Thursday that he has
discussed the divorce with Mrs. Ray, but no firm steps have been
taken.
   Mrs. Ray said she and her husband met in 1977, while she was
working as a free-lance courtroom artist. She married him Oct. 13,
1978, ``because I wanted to help him.''
   ``Somebody said, `Oh, I guess she wanted the money and the
publicity.' Well, I lost my job, I had to move, I had pets that
were terrorized and dismembered because of people who ... just
hated me,'' she said.
   She said Thursday that she has not seen her husband for about
two years, although they have exchanged letters.

   Jurors at the divorce-fixing conspiracy trial of
former Miss America Bess Myerson will be allowed to hear a key bit
of testimony from the prosecution's star witness, the judge ruled
today.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan decided, over defense
objections, that Sukhreet Gabel can describe a conversation she had
with her father after learning her mother was the judge presiding
over the divorce of Miss Myerson's lover.
   Miss Myerson, the city's cultural affairs commissioner at the
time, is charged with giving Ms. Gabel a city job to influence the
rulings of her mother, former Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel,
in the divorce of millionaire contractor Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   Ms. Gabel testified about the conversation with her father,
Milton, with the jury out of the courtroom Thursday because defense
lawyers objected to the testimony as hearsay.
   She said that when she learned from Capasso's housekeeper that
her mother was the judge in the Capasso divorce, she confronted her
father, and that he told her, ``Your mother knows all about it,''
and advised her, ``Don't get involved.''
   Mrs. Gabel, 75, Miss Myerson, 64, and Capasso, 43, are all
charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and bribe-related charges for
an alleged scheme to reduce Capasso's temporary support payments to
his estranged wife.
   In regular testimony Thursday, Ms. Gabel said Miss Myerson went
out of her way to cultivate a friendship with her, but tried to
keep their socializing secret. She said Miss Myerson told her not
to give her real name when she accompanied Miss Myerson to a party.
   Ms. Gabel, 39, described how Miss Myerson sought out her company
in the summer of 1983 after they met at a dinner party given by Ms.
Gabel's parents.
   Ms. Gabel said she twice made weekend visits to Capasso's Long
Island estate in Westhampton at Miss Myerson's invitation, but on
one visit her hostess fretted about whether to take her along to a
party.
   ``I don't know whether I ought to be doing this,'' Ms. Gabel
quoted Miss Myerson as saying, adding, ``Andy's against it.''
   Miss Myerson asked Ms. Gabel, who was divorced, what her married
name had been.
   When Ms. Gabel replied ``Revis,'' she said Miss Myerson put one
hand to her brow and pointed the other at her, saying, ``You tell
them your name is Revis.''
   Ms. Gabel's re-enactment of the scene provoked chuckles in the
packed courtroom, but Miss Myerson looked on tight-lipped.
   Ms. Gabel said she gave a non-committal answer to Miss Myerson's
idea but it turned out no one at the party asked her name anyway.
   Prosecutors maintain that Miss Myerson's interest in Ms. Gabel
developed only after the younger woman's mother began handling
interim rulings in Capasso's divorce.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle said today that Democrat Michael Dukakis lacked ``common
courtesy'' because he let a chance pass to say something nice about
George Bush during their second debate.
   Quayle, in his first news conference since Sept. 15, said he
found the moment ``very telling.''
   Both Bush and Dukakis were asked during the debate whether there
was something specific they had found about their opponent to
praise. Bush said he admired Dukakis' family and their open display
of affection for each other. Dukakis did not make any direct praise
of Bush.
   ``George Bush was very complimentary to Michael Dukakis on a
personal basis,'' Quayle said. He added, ``You would have thought
he (Dukakis) had the common courtesy to say something nice about
George Bush, but he didn't.''
   ``That's a very telling point,'' he said.
   Pressed to elaborate, Quayle said, ``He did lack the common
courtesy to say something nice.''
   After the debate Thursday night, Quayle called Bush the ``hands
down'' winner and said he believed his running mate delivered a
knockout punch to the Massachusetts Democrat.
   ``Say good night, Mike,'' Quayle said at a post-debate rally
Thursday night. Hundreds of supporters picked up the phrase and
began chanting, ``Say good night, Mike.''
   But Quayle said today the race was still competitive. ``We still
have a horse race.''
   At the rally, with a brass band, bluegrass group and American
flag as his backdrop, Quayle noted that Fort Smith had been the
setting for the movie ``True Grit'' and added: ``We know who showed
true grit tonight.''
   Using a baseball analogy, Quayle said Bush not only ``hit it out
over centerfield, he hit it out of sight. The bases were loaded,
and it was a grand slam.''
   Quayle watched the debate from his hotel room with several
advisers. A small pool of reporters and photographers was allowed
into the room just as the GOP nominee was asked whether Quayle was
qualified to be the 41st president should anything happen to Bush.
   The Indiana senator beamed as Bush said, ``I'm proud of my
choice.''
   The press was not present, however, to see Quayle's reaction
when it came time for Dukakis to address that question.
   At the rally, Quayle pulled the covering off a huge sign that
read, ``The winner is George Bush.''
   ``Vice President Bush won the debate tonight, hands down. He won
in every single category,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle telephoned Bush after the debate and told him he did a
``fantastic'' job, aides said.
   The Indiana senator had a light campaign day Thursday, with
appearances in Missoula, Mont., and Lawton, Okla.
   After touring an electric plant today, Quayle travels to
Lafayette, La., Albuquerque, N.M., and Wisconsin.
   His speech Thursday to a Blue Cross@Blue Shield service club in
Missoula was disrupted by a Bible-carrying man who stood on his
chair and declared: ``We need to defend our country with God's
principles, not missiles.''
   ``Why don't you apply them to yourself?'' Quayle retorted.
   As the audience shouted, ``Sit down!'' the man offered Quayle
his Bible.
   ``I would suggest you read it,'' Quayle said.

   A bank officer implicated in an international
drug-money laundering scheme told Senate investigators that he
managed an account for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega that was used to
pay Panamanian politicians.
   Amjad Awan, an officer of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, told a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Sept. 30 that he paid cash from the account after
receiving notes signed by Noriega.
   The testimony, made in a closed session, was released Thursday.
   Before the arrival of the notes, Awan said he got telephone
calls ``telling me to expect the person to come in to get these
funds.''
   When asked to whom the money was paid, Awan replied:
``Politicians. This was during the time of the elections in
Panama.''
   Noriega, who as head of the military effectively rules Panama,
has been indicted by two U.S. grand juries on charges of drug
trafficking, and the Reagan administration has pressed for his
ouster as defense chief.
   Awan said the balance in Noriega's account fluctuated but at one
point reached a high of ``$20 million, maybe $25 million.'' He
added that he made monthly trips to Panama to report to Noriega on
the status of the account.
   Awan was arrested by the U.S. Customs Service last week and
indicted this week on charges of money laundering. The
Luxembourg-based bank for which he works was charged in the Tampa
indictment with laundering $14 million in narcotics profits for
Colombia's Medellin cartel.
   Subcommittee counsel Jack Blum told senators present at the
Sept. 30 session that the testimony would be closely held because
of ``our concern for Mr. Awan's life,'' according to materials
released by the office of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who chaired the
subcommittee.
   A spokesman for Kerry said the panel voted after Awan's arrest
to release the testimony and send a copy to the Justice Department.
   The St. Petersburg Times on Thursday quoted an unidentified
Justice Department official who worked on both the Noriega and Bank
of Credit cases as saying: ``We have never been able to identify a
Noriega bank account outside of Panama. We would like to hope this
account would be a breakthrough.''
   He said U.S. investigators hope to obtain detailed records of
the account by the end of the week.

   Approximately 62 million viewers tuned in for
the final presidential debate, more than for either of the two
previous face-offs between the two parties, the A.C. Nielsen Co.
said today.
   About 58 percent of those watching television during the time
period Thursday night were tuned into the debate, according to
Nielsen's overnight figures from the 16 largest TV markets.
   The debate between Democrat presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
and Republican George Bush had a rating on NBC of 16.6 and a 24
share. ABC's coverage had a rating of 14.1 and a 20 share. CBS' had
a 9.6 and 14 share.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with televisions.
The share is the percentage of sets in use.
   PBS and CNN also carried the debate live, but their ratings are
not available immediately.
   An estimated 50 million viewers tuned into the vice presidential
debate last week between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Bush's running
mate, Dan Quayle, and about 60 million viewers watched the first
debate between Bush and Dukakis.

<HEAD>Scouts Review Neutral Policy on Animal Killing In Survival
Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH KIRKPATRICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Boy Scout officials will review
their neutral policy on killing animals for food as part of
wilderness survival training in light of complaints by animal
rights groups.
   National spokesman Frank Hebb initially said Thursday national
scout officials would ``take a look at it and see whether we should
ban this sort of thing. It's not necessary.''
   He said there was no timetable for making a decision.
   At a camp-out in nearby Perry County earlier this fall, scouts
were shown how to kill a rabbit and then prepare it for eating.
   Five to 10 scouts then accepted an invitation to test their
skills on rabbits, and the same procedure was done with four or
five chickens, said William J. Hawkins, executive director of the
Keystone Council, the local scout affiliate.
   ``We looked at the wilderness survival merit badge phamplet and
it put food at the very bottom for survival,'' Hebb said.
   H. Clay Criswell, executive director of the Humane Society of
Harrisburg Area Inc., said the most important things in survival
are finding shelter and water. ``You don't have to have meat to
stay alive.''
   Hawkins said he will recommend discouraging troops in the
11,500-scout Keystone Council from killing animals in future
survival programs.
   ``If we discourage it at the council level, it won't be done,''
Hawkins said.
   ``I don't appreciate the hue and cry. ... It's unfortunate,'' he
said, noting he got about 50 phone calls, mostly negative. ``It's
been blown out of proportion.''
   Trans-Species Unlimited of Williamsport, Pa., a national animal
rights group that has fought live pigeon shoots and fur sales,
demanded the Boy Scouts adopt a ban after The Patriot-News
newspapers reported the incident this week.
   ``We're very pleased to hear about that (policy review),'' said
Vice President Dana Stuchell.
   After a week of investigation, the Humane Society has been
unable to find anyone who would testify that the animals were
treated cruelly, Criswell said.
   About 75 to 90 boys and 20 to 30 leaders from 10 troops attended
the camp, where other sessions touched on building fires and
finding edible plants, Hawkins said. He added that the survival
camp-out was the first held in the 15 years he has been associated
with the council. The decison was made by the camp organizers, he
said.
   Hawkins said he believes the reports he received from scout
leaders who said the animals were not cruelly bludgeoned.
   G. John Giba, scoutmaster for one of the troops involved but who
was unable to make the trip, said his boys felt the killings were
done properly.
   ``We entered into this purely innocently,'' said Giba, who has
hunted deer and said the rabbits were handled better than some
hunters handle deer.

   Republicans celebrated George Bush's debate performance, some
even declaring the election won, but Democrats said today that
Michael Dukakis had made points, too, in the candidates' final
nationally televised encounter.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said today that Bush
was ``the clear winner'' in the debate, and he added: ``It seems to
me George Bush is going to win this election and he's going to win
it by a big margin, particularly in the Electoral College.''
   On the Democratic side, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, said of Bush, ``I'd say he won the debate if it were
a race for high school cheerleader.''
   Byrd said Dukakis ``had substance to his responses. I thought he
made some good points with his responses to the deficit.'' He
added, ``I'm not sure these debates really amount to much.''
   ``I think Bush can start measuring the curtains for the White
House,'' Delaware's GOP Gov. Michael Castle said Thursday night
after the debate.
   ``I think we got it,'' said Republican Rep. Lynn Martin of
Illinois. ``I've coached him (Bush) and I've never seen him that
good. He walked off that stage the president of the United States.''
   Democrats generally claimed victory for Dukakis on the issues,
but officials in both parties questioned whether he had done enough
to thaw his icy image.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., did say today on NBC's ``Today''
program that Dukakis ``came across as someone who understands the
problems American families experience out there, the problems of
living from paycheck to paycheck, in many cases one illness away
from financial disaster.''
   But James Baker III, Bush's campaign chairman, said on ``CBS
This Morning'' that Dukakis had too much to handle in trying to
warm up his image while trying to score a breakthrough that would
overcome Bush's lead in the polls.
   ``It's pretty hard to attack in a debate and at the same time
appear more likable,'' Baker said.
   Pennsylvania's Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Singel said Dukakis was
at least partly successful in breaking his image as a cold
technocrat.
   ``I don't think he's ever going to be Henny Youngman,'' Singel
said. ``But he was certainly more likable tonight and I think he
approached many of the questions with good humor. I think he showed
himself to be capable of warmth and I think the people will
appreciate that.''
   William Cunningham, a former adviser to Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo who is now working on Sen. Daniel Moynihan's re-election
campaign, summed it up this way: ``Dukakis was Dukakis. Bush was
loose, chipper, magnanimous. It worked out well for him.
   ``Dukakis should have been more like Zorba and less like Plato,
more like Kojak and less like Socrates.''
   And at least one Democrat gave the decisio to Bush.
   ``The one home run I heard was Bush's,'' said former Sen. Thomas
Eagleton of Missouri, who was George McGovern's running mate in
1972 until he withdrew from the ticket after it was revealed that
he had undergone shock treatments for psychiatric problems.
   ``When they asked who their heroes were, Dukakis was wandering
all over the stage,'' Eagleton said. ``Bush, with two minutes to
think about it, came up with some solid candidates and ended up
with the president.''
   Most observers from both parties agreed that the two candidates
seemed more at ease than they had during their first encounter.
   ``It was a better debate than the first one. There was a little
more spontaneity,'' said former White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker from his home in Huntsville, Tenn.
   But Baker called Bush the clear winner ``principally because he
took advantage to sharpen the issue differences between them in
defense and taxes ... His general demeanor was the most effective
thing. He was very presidential. He was calm and self-assured; his
answers were direct.''
   Even Republicans who didn't rate Bush a clear-cut winner said it
was enough that he avoided a poor showing.
   ``Dukakis had to do something dramatic and I don't think he did
it. I don't think he laid a glove on Bush,'' said Ellen Sauerbrey,
a GOP delegate from Maryland. ``I think barring some unforeseen
gaffe in the next couple weeks or a major world-shattering event. I
think the election is over. This was Dukakis' last chance to really
turn public opinion.''
   Heading into the debate, most polls gave Bush a narrow lead
among voters nationwide and a strong lead for electoral votes.
   Democratic Rep. John Dingell of Michigan disputed the notion
that it was a do-or-die test for his party's candidate.
   ``It was not really necessary for Mr. Dukakis to deliver a
knockout blow,'' Dingell said. ``There are 26 days left in the
campaign. A lot can happen and a lot will. The Dukakis campaign is
coming together and he'll do well.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis characterized the

adviser said today ``We're down a little bit ... but it's well
within range.''
   Dukakis prepared for a rally here while his campaign scrambled
to put the best face on a Thursday night debate performance that
left the candidate short of a breakthrough to even up a contest
that shows signs of a growing Republican advantage.
   The Democratic campaign unveiled two new televison
advertisements that will begin airing today and top aide John Sasso
said $13 million to $14 million would be spent on commercials in
the final weeks.
   Sasso conceded a George Bush edge in the instant public opinion
polls but said, ``We scored with undecided and swing voters last
evening. That's what we were looking for.''
   ``We're down a little bit, there's no question about that. But
it's well within range,'' Sasso told reporters.
   Sasso also brushed off queries about whether a Bush win was
inevitable as surveys point to an increasing Electoral College
advantage for the vice president.
   ``I don't agree with that,'' he said. ``You campaign as hard as
you can, you continue to talk about the things that are important
to you. You continue to make the case for change.''
   Dukakis ended the debate night with a call for a third debate.
   ``I think we ought to have that third debate, don't you?''
Dukakis asked a post-debate rally attended by about 2,000
supporters Thursday night. The crowd cheered wildly.
   Dukakis said debates enable the Democrats ``to get our opponents
out from behind the flag factory and the balloons and people get a
chance to see how they stand on the basic and fundamental
challenges that face the country.''
   But the second debate, according to some Democrats, did not
prove to be Dukakis' forum for delivering a knockout punch and
overcoming Bush's lead in recent nationwide polls.
   ``Dukakis was Dukakis. Bush was loose, chipper, magnanimous. It
worked out well for him,'' said William Cunningham, a former
adviser to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo who is now working for New
York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's re-election campaign.
   ``Dukakis was so much better on the issues, but he wasn't as
warm as Bush was,'' said Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona.
   Instant polls conducted by ABC News and the Los Angeles Times
declared Bush the clear winner.
   The ABC poll of 639 registered voters who viewed the debate
found 49 percent calling Bush the winner, 33 percent saying Dukakis
won and 18 percent rated the debate a tie. The survey had a margin
of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
   The Times survey scored Bush the winner 47 percent to 26 percent
with 27 percent undecided. The poll of 522 registered voters who
saw the debate had a margin of error of five percentage points.
   At the post-debate rally, Dukaks boasted of a ``clean sweep'' in
the debates and ridiculed Bush's selection of a running mate,
saying it demonstrated poor judgment that should not be allowed to
spill over to Supreme Court selections.
   ``If one question tonight demonstrated the stakes in this
election, it was the question about the Supreme Court of the United
States,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Remember this: the people who are appointed to the Supreme
Court of the United States by a president are there long after that
president leaves,'' Dukakis said. ``George Bush supported the
nomination of Robert Bork. George Bush demonstrated his commitment
to standards and quality and strength by picking as his running
mate the senator from Indiana.''
   Dukakis told supporters he was entering the ``all important''
final 25 days in the race for the White House as the underdog but
within striking distance.
   ``I don't have to tell you that this race is very, very close,''
he said. ``And it's going to get even closer after tonight and it's
going to get closer still in the days ahead.''
   Dukakis, who also attended two private receptions following the
debate, was campaigning in California and Washington today,
including a joint appearance with running mate Lloyd Bentsen in
Sacramento and an evening stop at a birthday party for Jesse
Jackson.
   At the post-debate rally, Dukakis said he would welcome a third
showdown with Bush.
   The vice president, whose campaign refused to participate in a
third debate, ruled out another encounter when asked Thursday night
if he would agreee to debate Dukakis again.
   Dukakis began the rally by asking ``What did you think?'' and
``A clean sweep?''
   Both questions were met with rousing applause.

   A British publisher today asked
bookstores to refrain from selling the book ``Occupation: Nazi
Hunter'' because a judge refused to lift an ordering banning
publication.
   Anton Gecas, who is mentioned in the book in connection with
alleged war crimes, was granted the order last month.
   Gecas, 72, of Edinburgh, is one of 17 people in Britain being
investigated by the Home Office in a war crimes inquiry. Gecas, a
former Lithuanian platoon commander, has denied committing war
crimes.
   Lord Cowie today dismissed a challenge to the banning order by
publishers Ashford Press Publishing of Hampshire at the Court of
Session in Edinburgh.
   He said the book could seriously prejudice a defamation action
against Times Newspapers by Gecas, which is due to be heard by a
Scottish court.
   The publishers had argued that the terms of the order were too
wide and a Scottish court had no power to ban a book in England.
   Lord Cowie said that as long as a Scottish court had
jurisidiction in a case, it could make an order that might apply
anywhere.
   He refused to grant a similar court order against the author of
the book, Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles, saying the ruling against the publishers already protected
Gecas. The center is committed to pursuing World War II Nazis who
have escaped prosecution for war crimes.
   After the hearing, Ashford Press sent letters to booksellers
throughout Britain informing them that the court order effectively
barring the firm from publishing the book worldwide and asking that
it should not be put on sale Monday as planned.

<HEAD>Jury Says Women's Group Libeled Man In Assault Accusation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has found that the group Women
Against Rape libeled a man when it circulated a flier that falsely
accused him of assault and attempted rape.
   Steve Carney, who was never charged, was awarded $7,500 for pain
and suffering and $25,000 in punitive damages by the seven-man,
five-woman panel.
   ``I feel a lot better, but I can't say I really won because
there may be people out there who saw it (the flier) and formed
their own opinions,'' Carney, 23, said after hearing Thursday's
verdict.
   ``I think it will teach them to be a little more careful about
what accusations they choose to print about people,'' he said.
   Carney, of Scotts Valley, sued Women Against Rape of Santa Cruz,
claiming the group publicly humilated him in a 1984 leaflet that
said he assaulted and attempted to rape Karen Winkler, 24.
   During the libel trial in Santa Cruz County Superior Court, it
was brought out that Winkler never went to police and swore in a
deposition that she didn't know what happened the night she went
out drinking with Carney and another co-worker.
   Representatives of WAR testified that they based the flier
solely on Winkler's word and by observing her behavior, which they
said was consistent with a profile of women who have been sexually
assaulted.
   Representatives of the organization earlier declined an offer
from Carney's lawyer that the suit would be dropped in exchange for
an apology and a retraction.
   Deanne Pernell and Jan Shirchild, both WAR directors, said they
would discuss an appeal with the organization's lawyers.
   WAR has said it is $500 in debt and is unlikely to be able to
meet the jury's verdict, but Carney's lawyer, David Sabih, said
money wasn't the paramount issue.
   During closing arguments on Wednesday, Sabih told the jury that
the issue was whether ``we as a society tolerate groups of
vigilantes who impose themselves as judge, jury and executioner.''
   Winkler, who did not testify at the trial, originally was named
in the suit but settled out of court with an apology for
participating in the publication of the flier.

   Sam Ketcham, the organ grinder expelled from
Lenox Square after 29 years because he wasn't ``upscale'' enough,
was back in the glitzy shopping mall for one night at an appearance
sponsored by one of the stores.
   Shoppers stood in line Thursday night to sign a petition calling
on the mall to bring back Ketcham, 72, and his monkeys.
   Ketcham's son, Robert, and a monkey entertained shoppers and
collected change at the Social Expressions card store while the
elder Ketcham, who said he did not feel well, watched.
   ``This guy's an institution,'' said store owner Albert D.
Maslia. ``Lenox has always been upscale. But upscale's got nothing
to do with a monkey.''
   The mall cited its toney image in evicting Ketcham in July. He
had worked crowds at the mall since it opened in 1959.
   A spokesman for the mall said Thursday that it is standing by
the decision.

<HEAD>McMartin Case Has `Poisoned' All Involved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The McMartin Pre-School molestation case
contributed to the deaths of two witnesses and ``has poisoned
everyone who had contact with it,'' says the judge who is presiding
over the long-running trial.
   The bleak comments by Superior Court Judge William Pounders came
Thursday, one day after he dismissed 27 prosecution charges against
Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey. He spoke in
response to a news media request to make public the prosecutors'
original trial witness list.
   The weekly newspaper, ``The Easy Reader,'' joined by the Los
Angeles Times, sought the names of more than 100 prospective
witnesses who never testified. The prosecution ended its
presentation of witnesses last week, and the defense is to begin
next week.
   The judge angrily refused to disclose the names, saying those
witnesses have privacy rights. Pounders said he refused to subject
people on the witness list to the ``embarrassment and harassment''
that plagued others.
   ``This case, in my view, has poisoned everyone who had contact
with it,'' Pounders said.
   ``We've had two deaths in connection with this case,'' he said
referring to a mother who died in 1986 from the side effects of
alcoholism and an investigator who committed suicide the day before
he was to testify in 1987.
   Kevin Cody, a reporter for ``Easy Reader'' who has covered much
of the trial, told the judge that the case has been ``the subject
of rumors and innuendo'' and added, ``Anything that's left unsaid
at the end of the case is going to weaken public confidence in the
verdict.''
   ``You're acting as a censor on a case which has repercussions
across the country,'' Cody told the judge.
   ``You are a good one to talk about this,'' Pounders shot back.
``You knew Paul Bynum fairly well and saw him suffer in this
courtroom,'' he said of the investigator who committed suicide.``I
understand you had dinner with him the night before this happened.''
   Cody did not respond to that comment but told the judge it was
foolish to base his rulings on ``who might die in this case.''
   Bynum, 39, a former police officer who had worked as a defense
investigator on the McMartin case, shot himself in the head last
Dec. 10, the day before he was to testify. A year before that, Judy
Ann Johnson, the mother who first brought the McMartin case to
police, died of alcohol-related liver disease.
   The McMartin case has been in the courts for five years, and the
trial has been under way for a year and a half.
   Buckey, 30, and his 61-year-old mother were charged with 100
molestation and conspiracy counts until Wednesday when the judge,
at the behest of prosecutors, dismissed 27 counts _ nearly a third
of the case. Prosecutors said they would seek dismissal of eight
more counts. The defendants are accused of molesting children at
the now defunct McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   In another ruling Thursday, the judge agreed to make public
written transcripts of videotapes that were played for jurors
during the trial. The tapes showed children being interviewed about
alleged molestations by therapists. The judge said he would delete
the children's names from the transcripts.

   The biggest gasoline price decline since
January offset a sharp, drought-caused rise in food prices as
inflation at the wholesale level rose a moderate 0.4 percent in
September, the government said today.
   Food prices skyrocketed 1.2 percent _ three times the August
rate and notice to consumers that the effects of the summer drought
have not yet played themselves out.
   Much of the momentum for the gain in food costs came from
escalating beef prices as producers ended the herd liquidations
that had depressed prices earlier in the drought cycle.
   Countering that was a 3.3 percent drop in energy prices, which
reflected declines for all major fuels. Gasoline prices, up 3.8
percent in August, fell 3.3 percent last month. Natural gas prices
fell 2.5 percent in September; home heating oil costs were down 4.6
percent.
   Labor Department analysts said these declines _ which sent
energy prices down at their steepest clip since January _ reflected
the current battle among oil-producing nations over production
quotas.
   The 0.4 percent September increase in prices for goods one step
short of the retail level represented a moderation from the overall
0.6 percent August advance.
   The September gain translates to an annual rate of 4.5 percent.
For the first nine months of 1988, wholesale prices rose at an
annual rate of 4.3 percent, nearly double last year's 2.2 percent
gain.
   Many private economists believe that Americans will benefit from
the world oil glut and say that, for all of 1988, inflation will
average around 3.4 percent.
   ``The basic balance is fairly clear. We have lower energy prices
offsetting higher food prices,'' said David Wyss, an economist with
Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Wyss said falling energy prices along with a slowdown in the
general economy should help put a damper on inflationary pressures
for the rest of the year.
   Two other reports released by the government today provided
evidence that the economy was slowing from a faster-than-expected
pace turned in during the first half of 1988.
   The Commerce Department said that retail sales fell for a second
consecutive month, dropping by 0.4 percent in September, indicating
some slowing in consumer demand.
   In the other report, the Federal Reserve said that industrial
production remained unchanged in September, the first time it has
failed to increase since February.
   The wholesale price report showed higher prices for a variety of
goods, not all the result of the drought.
   In addition to the 4.2 percent gain in beef prices, fruit costs
jumped 10.0 percent and vegetable prices jumped 16.5 percent.
Prices also rose for coffee and dairy products, both up 1.5 percent.
   Prices fell, however, for eggs, down 8.5 percent; pork, down 4.2
percent, and rice, down 3.6 percent.
   Department analyst Craig Howell said beef prices should rise
through the coming months as depressed supplies will keep costs
high.
   In fact, prices paid to farmers for live cattle, the first stage
at which wholesale prices are tracked, rose 1.1 percent in
September after a 1.5 percent August gain.
   Another factor pushing prices higher in September was a 1.8
percent increase in new automobile prices. Analysts said this
reflected lower end-of-the-model-year incentives to buyers than
would normally be the case.
   The September changes put the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index for finished goods at 108.6, meaning that a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 at wholesale in 1982 would have
cost $108.60 last month.
   Unlike the percentage changes, the index numbers are not
adjusted for seasonal variations, a process designed to remove
periodic, predictable effects from the calculations of price
movements.
   The government will release on Oct. 21 its report on price
changes at the consumer level. Through August, consumer prices were
rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, only slightly higher than
the 4.4 percent gain for all of 1987.

   A study of treating an AIDS-related condition
with an experimental drug called Ampligen has been stopped because
of disappointing results, the research's sponsors say.
   The study had enrolled about 330 patients with AIDS-related
complex at 11 centers in the United States.
   The research had been sponsored by a joint venture between HEM
Research Inc. of Philadelphia and Du Pont. Cessation of the
experiment was announced in a statement Thursday.
   Interim analysis of data from the study failed to show any
difference between Ampligen and a placebo that would justify
continuing the research, the statement said.
   Symptoms of AIDS-related complex are often less severe than
those of acquired immune deficiency syndome. Symptoms can include
loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, night sweats and swollen
lymph nodes.

<HEAD>Rockwell Acknowledges Exposure To Plutonium For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International has acknowledged for
the first time that three people were exposed to plutonium last
month in an incident that led to the shutdown of part of the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   Two Rockwell employees and a Department of Energy employee were
exposed to waste tainted by the radioactive element when they
entered an area of Building 771, where plutonium reprocessing is
done.
   Rockwell officials had said previously there was no release of
any radioactive material in the building and no contamination.
   Rockwell said a warning sign was blocked from view and the three
were unaware they should have been wearing respirators to protect
their lungs, Rockwell officials said.
   Rockwell operates the facility 16 miles northwest of Denver for
the Department of Energy, which ordered the building closed.
Rockwell officials said the shutdown of the building will have
little short-term effect on the plant's production of plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons, but a longer shutdown would cause a
production cutback.
   The shutdown of Building 771 and of reactors at the Savannah
River Plant in South Carolina have raised safety questions about
government nuclear weapons plants.
   Rockwell issued a statement Thursday saying laboratory test
results available this week revealed the three people had been
exposed to small amounts of plutonium.
   ``Results of those tests indicate the employees were exposed to
detectable amounts of plutonium well below all applicable (safety)
standards,'' Rockwell's statement said.
   None of the three is expected to have health problems as a
result of the incident, the Rockwell statement said.
   ``Colorado's annual background radiation level is 350
millirem,'' the statement said. ``This means the maximum exposure
to the three employees involved was nine-100,000ths of the average
Colorado resident's annual exposure to natural background radiation
exposure.''
   Plutonium is considered dangerous even in minute quantities
because of its high radioactivity. Researchers have said it has the
potential to cause cancer and brain tumors when inhaled or ingested.

   A man whose speeding car crashed into a

was sentenced today to the maximum term of up to seven years in
prison.
   Vincent Laezza, 21, of Selden was convicted last month of three
counts of criminally negligent homicide and second-degree assault
in the April 1987 accident.
   Laezza sobbed before the sentence was pronounced in Nassau
County Court, saying that he had ``never in my life hurt anybody.''
   ``I never meant to hurt anybody. It is something I have to live
with for the rest of my life,'' he said.
   He was sentenced to two and a third to seven years in prison.
   Newlyweds Carol and Peter Phillips of North Massapequa were
fatally injured when a speeding car crashed into their limousine as
it turned into a parking lot for their reception.
   Peter Phillips died at the scene with his brother and best man,
John. The bride died three weeks later.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military government announced
today that general elections will not be held before early 1989 and
that the date will be set after talks with political parties.
   Eighteen parties have taken up the government's call to register
with an election commisson, but none has said whether it will take
part in elections.
   Following weeks of bloody, anti-government protests, hard-line
Gen. Saw Maung seized power from a civilian government Sept. 18,
ordered his troops to shoot protesters and promised to hold general
elections within three months.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said troops killed four people today,
bringing to more than 450 the official number slain by security
forces since Sept. 18.
   The chairman of the five-member election council, Ba Htay, said
registered parties could open branches throughout the country after
consultation with ``law and order restoration councils,'' which
were set up by Saw Maung.
   The parties will be allowed to carry out organizational work on
their own premises, although a ban on public meetings of more than
five persons is still in force.
   ``All arrangements are expected to be ready by early next year,
and the date for holding of elections will be decided after
consultation with political parties,'' Saw Maung said in a
statement carried by the radio.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon are skeptical that free and fair
elections can be held given the ruthlessness with which the ruling
elite put down open dissent in recent months.
   There is a general consensus among Rangoon diplomats that Ne
Win, who seized power in 1962, is still orchestrating the
government and military moves despite his formal retirement in late
July.
   Ne Win molded the military machine and the Burma Socialist
Program Party, which has changed its name to the National Unity
Party.

<TEXT>
   Since President Reagan took office in 1981,
his policy of financing the Contra rebels in their war against
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has been one of the most
divisive foreign policy questions facing Congress and the nation.
Here is a chronology of the ups and downs of that policy:
   1981 _ Congress, late in the year, approves $19 million in
covert military aid to the rebels. The money, to be managed by the
CIA, is part of a classified intelligence bill.
   1982 _ A second infusion of $19 million, again part of a
classified bill, is approved. This time, restrictive provisions are
added that prevent any of the money from being used to overthrow
the Sandinistas. There are reports, as well, that the CIA has used
an additional $10 million from its contingency fund.
   1983 _ The House votes to end Contra aid, but a later compromise
results in the appropriation of $24 million for the rebels. This
time, the money is appropriated openly, and the CIA is barred from
using any money from its contingency fund to supplement the new aid.
   1984 _ In April, reports surface that the CIA has supervised the
mining of three Nicaraguan ports, and Congress votes to cut off aid
to the rebels. But at the end of the year, lawmakers vote to set
aside $14 million for the rebels, to be released after Feb. 28,
1985, if Congress approves in a separate vote at that time.
Congress adds new restrictions, saying the CIA and the Pentagon may
not use the money to support paramilitary operations in Nicaragua
unless specifically authorized by Congress.
   1985 _ In April, the Senate votes to release the $14 million,
but the House disapproves the resolution, denying the money to the
rebels. That summer, Congress approves $27 million for the Contras
but restricts its use to food, clothing, medicine and other
``humanitarian'' aid. The money is directed to be used by the
administration as leverage to promote peace negotiations, and the
CIA and Defense Department are barred from any role in distributing
the money.
   1986 _ In the fall, Congress approves $100 million _ its largest
single appropriation for the rebels _ the bulk of it for military
aid. Restrictions on the CIA's role are lifted, except that the
agency remains barred from using its contingency fund.
   1987 _ In March, the House passes a moratorium on Contra aid in
an effort to hold up the final $40 million of the aid bill approved
in 1986, but the measure dies in the Senate. At the end of the
fiscal year, on Sept. 30, Congress begins a series of stopgap
funding measures that include money for ``non-lethal'' aid for the
rebels totaling $20 million.
   1988 _ The House on Feb. 3 kills President Reagan's request for
$36 million in rebel aid, and a month later it rejects a Democratic
alternative of $30 million. The rebels reach a negotiated truce
with the Sandinistas on March 23, and Congress votes to provide $48
million. Peace talks break down in June and U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton is expelled from Nicaragua a month later, although the truce
remains in effect. A $47.1 million aid proposal fails to win
congressional approval in the summer. On Friday, after reports that
Reagan had given up on obtaining new military aid before Congress
adjourned, the president says he ``would not hesitate'' to call a
special session later in the year if he decided military aid was
needed.

<HEAD>Senate Might Finish $2.6 Billion Drug Bill Today</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with resumption of debate; picks up 2nd graf
pvs, Lawmakers who</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Senate rolled toward passage of a $2.6
billion, campaign-season drug bill today that would dangle the
possibility of the death penalty in front of many drug offenders
who kill.
   Senators today began debating an amendment that would allow
judges to strip convicted illegal drug users of many federal
benefits, including student loans, mortgage guarantees and
licenses. The benefits could be halted for up to one year for a
first conviction and for five years for additional convictions.
   ``If you've got a license to operate a radio station and you're
smoking marijuana, you're going to be subject to losing that
license, and clearly our intent is to say here that we are not
going to tolerate the use of marijuana,'' said the provision's
sponsor, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Liberals mounted a fight against the proposal, arguing that it
was too harsh.
   ``Why not adopt the Moslem way of doing things?'' asked Sen. Dan
Evans, R-Wash. ``Cut off a hand for a first conviction. Cut off the
other one for a second conviction. That would be a deterrant.''
   Lawmakers who feared earlier that the wide-ranging measure might
be stillborn because of a torrent of more than 100 amendments began
feeling more optimistic Thursday after a mixture of private
bargaining sessions and floor debates eased several potential
logjams.
   ``I believe the end is in sight now,'' Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., told his colleagues as they ended their work
Thursday evening.
   Congress, which had hoped to adjourn for the year today, was now
expected to return next week to try to finish the measure. With 33
Senate seats and all 435 House seats being contested on Election
Day, many incumbents would like to have bragging rights to a tough,
crime-fighting package.
   Senators still had more than 50 amendments to wade through. The
suggested changes vary from strengthening child pornography laws
and encouraging states to confiscate the drivers' licenses of
drunken motorists on the spot to requiring warning labels on
containers of alcoholic beverages.
   But many of the testiest disputes, some of them constitutional
issues that pitted liberals against conservatives, seemed to have
been soothed by compromises or were resolved when one side simply
outmuscled the other.
   Conservative lawmakers prevailed when senators voted 64-25 to
retain a provision that would allow capital punishment for people
involved in illegal drug activities who kill or order the death of
civilians or law enforcement officers.
   Death penalty supporters such as Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
argued that the sanction was needed to combat ``the incredible
butchery'' drug dealers were committing on the streets.
   ``It's long overdue that that punishment be available,'' D'Amato
said.
   But liberal opponents from both parties, arguing that capital
punishment is barbaric, offered an amendment that would substitute
mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for death
sentences.
   ``Why is it that the Senate's resolve to fight drug abuse and
drug-related crime hangs on whether we will flip the switch on the
electric chair,'' asked Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   With the House having passed an even harsher version of the bill
last month _ containing a somewhat broader death penalty provision
_ enactment of the legislation will almost certainly mean a new
federal death sentence statute.
   Senators also voted 88-0 Thursday to add a provision allowing
fines of up to $10,000 to be levied against people found to possess
even small amounts of illegal drugs.
   The two-year legislation uses a shotgun approach to dealing with
illicit drugs, showering 60 percent of its money on prevention and
treatment programs and 40 percent on law enforcement.
   It would add $676 million to federal agency budgets to hire
3,287 new law officers and purchase new equipment, and distribute
$275 million to state and local authorities.
   A Cabinet-level ``drug czar'' would be created to oversee
federal anti-drug efforts, penalties for dealing drugs near schools
would be increased, and public housing authorities would be allowed
to hire investigators to gather evidence of drug-use by tenants.
   In addition, $1 billion would be provided for treatment programs
across the country, including money to build facilities and train
counselors and teachers. And airline, railroad and trucking
industry workers would be subjected drug and alcohol testing.
   Left unanswered is where money to pay for the measure's
initiatives would come from. Some senators and their aides said
Thursday that legislators might pass separate legislation to
provide the funds _ and add to the deficit _ either next week or
after the 101st Congress convenes in January.
   The House and Senate would have to work out their differences
before sending a bill to President Reagan for his signature.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Wilks' rearrest today,
picking up 8th graf pvs, `Darrell Dowdell ....' Note contents</NOTE>

   The Cross Plains Cemetery is dotted
with mounds of freshly turned soil, marking graves reopened by
families who feared that a funeral director improperly buried their
loved ones.
   Many were horrified by what they found.
   ``This lady right here, her casket was rolled over on its side
and one of her arms and her head was sticking out,'' said Bonnie
Clinard of Springfield.
   Funeral director Bobby Wilks of nearby Milldale was arrested
after family members told authorities he had buried a body without
the $375 vault they purchased. When the grave was opened, there was
no vault.
   At least 10 other families have filed complaints since Wilks,
52, was charged a week ago with fraud and attempting to commit a
felony, Robertson County Sheriff Bill Norman said.
   The funeral director was arrested again today by sheriff's
deputies as he checked out of the Tennessee Christian Medical
Center in Madison, said Robertson County Chief Deputy Milton
Frederick.
   Wilks was charged with six counts of obtaining money under false
pretenses, said sheriff's Lt. J. Jones. Bond was set at $80,500,
and Jones said he expected to turn Wilks over to Sumner County
deputies ``as soon as we get through processing him here.''
   Sumner County Chief of Detectives George Farmer said Wilks is
charged there with one count of larceny by use of false pretenses.
   Wilks' son, Gary Wilks, was charged last week with larceny and
released on bond, authorities said.
   Darrell Dowdell, an independent gravedigger, said he knew of 11
graves that were reopened in three cemeteries around this community
about 40 miles north of Nashville, and only one was done properly.
   ``The others ranged from slightly wrong to grossly wrong. Some
were put in on their sides, some had the vaults removed or the
caskets were damaged or they were the wrong caskets,'' he said.
   ``One had the vault and casket removed. It was just a body
laying in the dirt,'' he said.
   Trash, including cans, bottles, a bag of human hair, and flower
arrangements, was found in all 10 graves, Dowdell said. Some bodies
were found surrounded by trash inside the casket.
   ``One had an old metal flower pot on top of his head. It was
like he (Wilks) was mad at them all,'' Dowdell said.
   Terry Carlisle shoveled dirt from his father's grave Thursday
afternoon as his mother and a dozen other people watched.
   With the help of relatives, he dug down about two feet and used
a metal rod to probe another four feet into the grave. No sign of a
casket or vault for Andrew Carlisle was found.
   ``I don't think we're going to find any casket,'' said Ola
Carlisle, whose husband was buried in 1982. The family said they
would have a funeral home exhume the body Friday.
   Mrs. Carlisle said she had trusted Wilks completely and was not
suspicious at the funeral when he asked family members to leave the
grave site before the coffin was lowered.
   The Robertson County Health Department had issued 19
disinterment permits by Thursday afternoon, secretary Paulette
Cowan said.
   Wilks, who resigned as a Robertson County commissioner the day
he was charged, was admired and respected by the community, Mrs.
Clinard said.
   ``I've known him all my life,'' she said. ``There wasn't nothing
he wouldn't do for nobody. People didn't give him nothing but a
good name. For him to do something like this is crazy.''
   Betty Ruth Jones, whose parents, husband and daughter were
buried by Wilks, said she had no intention of checking the graves.
   ``I think it's a disgrace,'' she said. ``God laid those to
rest.''

   Sponsors of a study into treating AIDS-related
complex with an experimental drug called Ampligen have stopped the
research, citing disappointing results.
   Ampligen failed to show any advantage over a placebo that would
justify continuing the research, the sponsors said.
   Some 330 patients had been enrolled at 11 centers in the United
States for the study, sponsored as a joint venture by HEM Research
Inc. of Philadelphia and E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. of
Wilmington, Del.
   The end of the experiment was announced Thursday. HEM said it
plans to study Ampligen further for its effect against the AIDS
virus, cancer and other diseases.
   Symptoms of AIDS-related complex, called ARC, are often less
severe than those of acquired immune deficiency syndome. Symptoms
can include loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, night sweats and
swollen lymph nodes.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of immigration officers at British air
and sea ports dressed casually in track suits or T-shirts and jeans
Friday to protest the government's refusal to pay allowances for
coats and ties.
   The Immigration Service Union argues that if the Home Office,
which is responsible for immigration affairs, ``requires us to
dress in a formal style, they should pay for it.''
   Its 1,200 members across the country voted to show up for work
in casual dress after the Treasury refused a $425 annual allowance
for uniforms, said spokesman Mike Smith.
   The Home Office expects officers to wear a jacket, shirt and
tie, Smith said.
   The union does not want ``to present a scruffy outward image to
the public,'' and has had no complaints from the public, he said.
   ``Strangely enough, the public don't seem bothered by it,'' he
said. ``The Home Office's senior management are bothered about it.''

   Sikh militants Friday shot and killed an
Indian newsman whose newspaper group harshly criticized Sikh
separatist demands, a news agency reported.
   Prem Nath, who worked for the popular Hindi-language newspaper
group The Hind Samachar, was killed at his home in Bara-Bakala in
Punjab state, the Press Trust of India reported. His assailants
escaped.
   Nath, a Hindu, is the 14th journalist slain by Sikh militants
since they started their campaign in 1981 for an independent
homeland in Punjab.
   The militants allege that Sikhs, who make up about 2 percent of
India's 880 million people, are discriminated against by the
majority Hindus.
   United News of India said four policemen and a Sikh militant
were killed in a battle in Ludhiana, Punjab, late Thursday.
   The slayings brought the death toll blamed on Sikh militants to
2,063 this year.

   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey was
hospitalized Friday with a lung infection, his fourth hospital
visit in eight days, the government said.
   Haughey, 63, was taken to the private wing of the Mater Hospital
from his Dublin home and is expected to spend several days
receiving treatment for ``a severe respiratory infection,'' said
spokeswoman Jackie Coogan.
   No other details on the illness were released.
   Haughey left the hospital Thursday after receiving treatment for
recurring pain from a kidney stone. He also was treated for the
same ailment last weekend and on Oct. 6, the spokeswoman said.
   A Cabinet meeting in Dublin was canceled, she said.
   Haughey heads the Fianna Fail party and was elected to his third
term as Taoiseach, or prime minister, in February 1987.
   He first became prime minister in December 1979, replacing Jack
Lynch, who retired. He lost an election in 1981, was voted back in
for a nine-month term in 1982, and lost another election that year
which left him in the opposition until he defeated Garret
FitzGerald and his Fine Gael party last year.

   Qian Changzhao, a former official in the
Nationalist government and a ranking member of the mainland version
of the Kuomintang party, died Friday at the age of 89, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
   Qian was vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Kuomintang, one of eight small non-communist parties
permitted to exist by the ruling Communist Party.
   He was also vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, a national advisory body.
   Qian was born in Jiangsu province and studied at London
University and Oxford before returning to China to become an
official of the Kuomintang government.
   Before 1949 he served as secretary of Chiang Kai-shek's Foreign
Ministry, executive vice minister of education and director of the
National Resources Commission.
   He stayed in China after the Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949
and in 1954 was elected as deputy from Shandong province to the
National People's Congress.

<HEAD>Louvre Pyramid Opens to Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of visitors streamed into the refurbished
courtyard of the Louvre on Friday for their first close-up look at
a giant glass pyramid destined to be the museum's new entrance.
   President Francois Mitterrand cut a tricolored ribbon leading to
the Cour Napoleon, a vast esplanade between the museum's two main
wings that had been closed to the public for four years.
   The pyramid, 71 feet tall and costing $15 million, was designed
by I.M. Pei, also on hand for the inauguration.
   Surrounded by three smaller glass pyramids and set off by seven
triangular basins in deep blue granite, the pyramid seemed to
change with the weather _ dull gray when clouds blocked the sun,
then brilliant in the sunshine.
   ``It's like a jewel, a diamond sparkling in the outdoors,'' said
Christiane Weiler, a visitor from Toulon. ``It's much more
beautiful than I expected.''
   The Louvre, built by King Philippe Auguste in 1200 as a
fortress, underwent many structural changes according the tastes of
its inhabitants over the centuries before it became a museum after
the French Revolution in 1789.
   The pyramid had been the subject of heated debate since the
project was unveiled at the beginning of Mitterrand's term of
office. But many of Friday's visitors said they weren't shocked by
the clash of the old and the new.
   ``It's breathtaking,'' said Peggy Curran, 22, a Columbus, Ohio,
native. ``The contrast between the classical style and the pyramid
seems to sum up Paris.''

<HEAD>Students Return After Picketing Over String Of Temporary Teachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEARLINGTON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-seven students returned to a
seventh grade class Friday after a four-day boycott and picketing
to demand assignment of a permanent teacher to end a string of
substitutes and temporaries.
   On Thursday, teacher Thad Williams had only one student for his
first day at Charles B. Murphy Elementary School. The other 27
either picketed outside the Hancock County school board offices or
stayed home.
   ``They're confusing us because one teacher comes and tells us
one thing, then another comes and tells us something else,''
student Ronnell Randle said.
   The class has had only one English test and two science tests
this year and only one homework assignment, said student Daniel
McGuire.
   ``The substitutes just make us write the chapter, copy the book.
How can you learn, writing the book?'' Jamie Bennett asked.
   Cheryl Bennett, one of about five parents who marched with the
youngsters, said more students would have picketed had they been
able to get transportation.
   ``It's been seven weeks,'' she said. ``Nine-week tests are
coming up. If they're going to give the kids grades, they're going
to have to have papers at home to justify the grades.''
   She said school officials ``have never contacted us to try to
work it out. We never received any information saying `We're trying
to get you a teacher. We're having trouble.'''
   Bennett said the students returned Friday because they were
willing to give Williams a chance. ``We don't want to make a
spectacle. We just want to make a point,'' she said.
   School Superintendent Terrell Randolph said six teachers had
left Charles B. Murphy this year for various reasons, and the
seventh grade teacher moved to eighth grade. He said a new seventh
grade teacher was employed but had problems obtaining certification
for that grade level.
   He said a certified teacher was then hired, evaluated and let
go. In the interim, substitute teachers have been used.
   Randolph said Williams, a certified teacher with a master's
degree in elementary education, will be paid as a substitute until
he is evaluated sometime next week to determine if he can keep the
job.
   He said he had searched nearby Mississippi and Louisiana school
districts for qualified teachers, but not many wanted to commute to
Pearlington, on the Gulf Coast.
   He said others weren't interested in a job that required
teaching math, English, science and social studies in a
self-contained classroom. In larger schools, seventh and eighth
grades are departmentalized, with different teachers teaching
different subjects.
   Bennett said she understands the district's problems.
   ``But that's not our problem. Our problems are our kids. That's
why these people are elected by us, why they're paid good salaries.
We just want what every other school in Hancock County has,'' she
said.

<HEAD>In Baseball-Crazy Nicaragua, Joy Over `Guerrillas' _ The LA
Dodgers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington and Managua may be at odds,
but how important can that be when the Los Angeles Dodgers _
described here admiringly as ``a bunch of guerrillas'' _ have made
it to the World Series?
   Come October, ``beisbol''-crazed Nicaraguans think more about
the arms in the bullpen than the arms to the Contras.
   ``Baseball defeated the ideologies,'' said Juan Navarro, sports
editor of the opposition daily La Prensa.
   Hundreds of Nicaraguans packed bars at tourist hotels during the
American and National League playoffs, paying about $14 _ almost
the equivalent of a monthly minimum wage _ for three drinks and the
right to sit and watch satellite transmissions on a large screen.
   When the New York Mets' Howard Johnson looked at a called third
strike from the Orel Hershiser on Wednesday night to end the
National League playoffs, Nicaraguans shouted approval in sympathy
with the underdog.
   ``Latins have always liked the Dodgers because the Dodgers have
always had Latin players,'' Navarro said. ``Besides, they always
played the Yankees.''
   The regular anti-U.S. tone of newspapers changes during the
postseason play in ``El Norte.''
   Barricada, the government newspaper, had a one-word headline to
explain the the Dodgers' triumph: ``Guts.''
   Barricada sports editor Edgardo Tijerino wrote that the win over
the Mets by Tommy Lasorda's gang ``ratifies the greatness of
baseball where everything is possible, including having an apparent
flyweight beat a heavyweight.''
   Local columnists write about the Dodgers, Mets, Athletics and
Red Sox with authority.
   One writer, reflecting on a subject Nicaraguans are familiar
with, called the Dodgers ``a bunch of guerrillas.''
   The Sandinista government started as a guerrilla movement that
overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979; since then, the United
States has supported Contra guerrillas who want to overthrow the
Sandinistas.
   Baseball arrived in Nicaragua in 1891 and grew in the early part
of the century, boosted by the presence for many years of the
Marines during the many U.S. interventions in Nicaragua.
   Nicaragua has hundreds of amateur teams and an organized
national baseball league. The championship in April pitted a team
from the English-speaking and often rebellious east coast against a
Sandinista army team from the capital of Managua.
   The army team, supported by members of the Sandinista party
directorate, came back from a 3-1 deficit to win in seven.
   One of the most tragic moments in the American film ``Under
Fire,'' which depicted the triumph of the Sandinistas in 1979, came
when an aspiring pitcher turned grenade-thrower is killed by an
American mercenary.
   Baseball fanaticism doesn't stop at the border. Only last month
a U.S. philanthropist delivered a load of vital supplies to
Nicaraguan refugees who have fled to Honduras: bats, balls and
gloves.
   Several Nicaraguans have made it to the majors; the best known
currently is pitcher Dennis Martinez of the Montreal Expos.
   An economic crisis and a U.S. embargo make seeing the playoffs
in Nicaragua difficult, but not impossible. International hotels
pick up the television picture with satellite dishes for their
closed circuit transmissions.
   The high cost of TV rights and problems caused by the U.S.
embargo rule out general television broadcasts, but correspondents
stationed in the hotels relay play-by-play and color commentary in
Spanish on at least four radio stations.

   When the call came, the McIntyre volunteer
fire company found there was no way to get its equipment on the
road.
   The burning building was owned by Valjean Wissinger, who
happened to be at the fire station repairing a leaking gasoline
tank on a fire truck.
   Because that truck blocked the main door of the fire hall, two
other trucks couldn't get out.
   It was the first time in 23 years that the volunteer fire
company could not respond to an alarm, though firefighters from
four other communities responded.
   The fire, which investigators labled suspicious, destroyed
Wissinger's building as well as a pickup parked nearby.

<HEAD>Thatcher Winds Up Conservative Convention Looking To The 1990s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
winding up the annual conference of her Conservative Party, today
pledged she will be as staunch an ally to the new American
president as she has been to Ronald Reagan.
   She was speaking in a keynote address received with thunderous
applause and chants of ``10 More Years,'' from the 4,500 delegates.
   Mrs. Thatcher also urged Britons to maintain a ``generous
society'' _ in what was widely seen as an initiative on social
issues following nearly a decade of her right-wing economic
policies.
   Millions of Britons have become richer as a result of Thatcher's
policies, but unemployment has more than doubled, and critics
charge she has encouraged a materialistic, greedy and uncaring
society.
   At the end of the 45-minute address, delegates waved Union Jacks
and the blue flag of the Conservative Party as the convention
center in this south England resort echoed with more chants of ``10
More Years.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, flanked by the party hierarchy, declared:
``The Conservative Party occupies the common ground of British
politics ... And so it has fallen to us to lead Britain into the
1990s. And, who knows, beyond.''
   The delegates joined in a traditional chorus of the national
anthem, ``God Save The Queen,'' and the favorite Tory anthem,
``Land of Hope and Glory.''
   On Britain's particularly close relationship with the United
States in the 1980s while she and Reagan have been in office, Mrs.
Thatcher said Reagan ``has rebuilt the strength and confidence of
the West _ not without a little help _ and inspired the democracies
to go out and win the battle of ideas.''
   ``It is vital that Britain and America should always stand
together. So the next president of the United States too will have
the United Kingdom as a staunch ally.''
   On social issues, Mrs. Thatcher said her economic policies were
encouraging not greed but ``the best in human nature.''
   She urged Britons to give more to charity, assist in crime
prevention and promised new efforts to preserve the environment.
   ``The fact is that prosperity has created not the selfish
society but the generous society,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   She also said the founding concept of the European Economic
Community was ``under attack from those who see European unity as a
vehicle for spreading socialism.''
   Referring to a speech last month in which she ruled out a united
states of Europe and stressed the separate identities of the 12 EEC
countries, Mrs. Thatcher said it stirred criticism because ``it
wasn't at all convenient for those who want to bring about a
federal Europe by stealth.''
   ``We haven't worked all these years to free Britain from the
paralysis of socialism only to see it creep through the back door
of central control and bureacracy from Brussels,'' she said of the
EEC headquarters in the Belgian capital.
   Mrs. Thatcher's domestic theme of civic responsibility in the
keynote speech reflected official anxiety about rising crime,
including street violence and hooliganism by soccer fans, in a
period of growing prosperity.
   On Thursday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the
treasury chief, said the government was determined to hold down
spending, a cornerstone of Mrs. Thatcher's policy.
   With inflation up to 5.7 percent and rising, Lawson in his
address avoided a timetable for a government pledge to cut basic
income tax from 25 to 20 percent. He promised tax cuts ``when
prudent'' and forecast a drop next year in inflation.
   Despite signs of trouble in an economy where earlier tax cuts
and huge borrowing by consumers has fueled growth, Mrs. Thatcher
retains a comfortable lead in polls over the opposition Labor Party.
   Labor, which held its annual conference last week, is tussling
with a policy overhaul aimed at moderating its left-wing platform.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Cabinet Dominated by Commmunist Party Members</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, `However, Radowski...' to CORRECT spelling to
Rakowski.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament approved a new
communist-dominated Cabinet today that failed, according to Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski, to broaden the base of the government
by including opposition members.
   However, Rakowski insisted that Poland will be able to achieve
political reform without participation of the banned trade union
Solidarity.
   ``I don't limit democratization to the recognition of
Solidarity. I don't think that the restoration of Solidarity may be
proof of the fact that our country is becoming more democratic,''
he said at his first news conference as prime minister.
   ``I think the democratic processes which are being implemented
in Poland for several years now are accelerating at present, and it
is all happening without the participation of Solidarity,''
Rakowski said.
   Rakowski made his remarks at a 90-minute session broadcast live
on national radio just after Poland's parliament, the Sejm,
approved the new Cabinet by a 363-1 vote.
   A new generation of young party members Rakowski nominated
Thursday assumed posts to oversee economic affairs, but senior
communist party members retained the key interior, defense and
foreign ministers.
   Andrzej Wroblewski, 38, became the head of the important
Ministry of Finance and Dominik Jastrzebski, 46, took charge of the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation.
   Mieczyslaw Wilczek, a wealthy private businessman, who is also a
communist party member, assumes the post of Minister of Industry.
   Rakowski reserved four spots in his government for what he
termed the ``constructive opposition,'' but said the unidentified
candidates for the posts have turned them down.
   On Thursday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said whether the
opposition accepts the posts depends on whether the government
could bring about change and accept the banned union.
   The Cabinet changes are aimed at ending a political and economic
crisis in Poland, with an annual inflation rate of 60 percent.
   Rakowski bumped several senior officials responsible for the
government's failing economic reform program. Deputy Prime Minister
Czeslaw Sadowski, the economic planning chief and Deputy Prime
Minister Zbigniew Szalajda, the industry chief, lost their jobs.
   Rakowski proposed nine new ministers. Five belong to the ruling
Polish United Workers' Party, or communist party, one is from the
Peasants' Party, and two are from the Democratic Party. Both
parties are allies of the communist party.
   Izabela Planeta-Malecka, the designated minister of health and
social policy, was the only non-party member and only woman
nominated.
   Rakowski had proposed the four opposition members, who he didn't
name, as deputy premier, minister of labor and social policy,
undersecretary in the Housing Ministry, and a newly created post as
minister without portfolio in charge of contacts with various
communities.
   In his speech Thursday, Rakowski said he hoped coming talks
between the government and the opposition, including Walesa, could
lead to change.
   ``We approach it with the best of will. We are aiming for
reasonable compromise which would ensure the maximum of possible
change,'' he said.
   Authorities promised the talks following widespread strikes in
August, Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years.
   The talks, to begin next week, will discuss the political and
economic crisis and consider the future of Solidarity, which was
the Soviet bloc's only recognized trade union until it was
suppressed in 1981 and banned in 1982.
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, at the end of
a three-day visit to Poland, today urged patience in the talks and
said he hoped they would lead to the relegalization of Solidarity.
   Rakowski, former party propaganda chief, was approved Sept. 27
to replace Zbigniew Messner, whose Cabinet resigned Sept. 19 after
fierce criticism for mishandling the party-approved economic reform
program. It was the first time the entire government stepped down
in postwar Poland.

<HEAD>Talks for Hostage Release in Recess, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: ADDS 5 grafs at bottom with U.S. denial.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today that teams
representing the United States and Iran have recessed talks aimed
at releasing American hostages in Lebanon because of news leaks
about the negotiations.
   But The Nation, a new English-language weekly that has run
several articles on the subject, said ``skeleton delegations''
remained in Switzerland ready to resume talks.
   The United States has denied repeatedly that any official
negotiations are under way with Iran to try to secure freedom for
nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Iranian-backed Shiite
Moslems.
   The nine are among 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon. The longest
held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   This month, Indian professor Mithileshwar Singh was freed by his
Shiite captors. Singh, a legal resident of the United States, was
kidnapped 20 months earlier with three American professors who
remain in capitivity.
   ``Leaders of the U.S. and Iranian negotiating teams returned
home for consultations this week, leaving skeleton delegations
ready to resume contacts,'' The Nation said.
   It added: ``The delay in resumption of negotiations is
attributed partly to the reports on the talks.''
   The recess came after the talks ``reached a crucial phase''
following Singh's release, the paper said. It did not elaborate.
   The paper also quoted an unidentified Iranian diplomat in Geneva
as saying Iran has been disappointed with the U.S. stance in the
talks.
   ``All the U.S. and Britain are offering to date is long-term aid
for restoring Iran's war-damaged economy and only through a
friendly Third World nation,'' the diplomat was quoted as saying.
   In its first story on the reported talks two weeks earlier, The
Nation said the United States struck a secret deal with Iran,
promising economic aid, renewal of arms sales, the release of
billions of dollars of frozen Iranian assets in U.S. banks and
resumption of diplomatic relations.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man
with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also
sought by the Irish government.
   The British Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec
Collett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian
abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.
   At the White House today, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater again denied that negotiations with Iran were taking
place.
   ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government. No one
is authorized to negotiate for the government,'' he said.
   ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of people around
the world free-lancing on this situation,'' he said. Fitzwater also
predicted there would be more such stories, although he did not say
why.
   ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostly
detrimental,'' he said. ``What they do is build up people's
expectations when they are not warranted.''
   ``We think they are very counterproductive in terms of getting
the hostages out,'' Fitzwater said.

   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued three
people from a burning shrimp boat in the Gulf of Mexico today after
the men radioed for help, officials said.
   Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy of Coast Guard Air
Station-Ellington said the helicopter was dispatched to the 70-foot
commercial shrimper, Master Warren, shortly after 3 a.m. when the
three notified authorities that the vessel was ablaze some 13 miles
southwest of Galveston.
   The boat was about five miles from shore, he said.
   ``They found the vessel fully engulfed in flames and the three
people standing as far back as possible,'' Kennedy said. ``They
seemed to be suffering from smoke inhalation, so after they were
hoisted off the vessel they were taken to John Sealy Hospital in
Galveston.''
   Doctors there found the men in good condition and they were not
admitted, Kennedy said.
   The owner and operator of the Master Warren, which is based in
Port Arthur, was identified as Banh Prinh, and the two crew members
were identified as Bob and Pan Nguyen, Kennedy said.
   Coast Guard crews continued to battle the fire aboard the
shrimper this morning.
   ``Just about the time that the helicopter crew was hoisting the
people, a patrol boat from the Coast Guard base in Galveston
arrived at the scene and began fighting the fire,'' Kennedy said,
adding that another boat was expected to arrive later and tow the
shrimper to shore.

<HEAD>PLO Advised To Hold New Initiatives For After Israeli Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union convinced PLO officials they
should wait until after the Israeli elections to declare a
Palestinian state and government or they would hurt chances for
peace, a newspaper reported.
   The French daily Le Monde said the Soviets told Palestinian
leaders that making their move before the Nov. 1 vote could benefit
candidates of the Israeli right.
   The officials met with Mahmoud Abbas, a member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization executive committee, on Monday and Tuesday
in Moscow, Le Monde said in a report published Thursday.
   Also Thursday, the United Arab Emirates newspaper Al-Ittihad
quoted Yassir Ahd-Rabbo, head of the PLO information department, as
saying the Palestine National Council will meet Oct. 31 to declare
the independent state. The PNC is the PLO's parliament in exile.
   Soviet officials said before the Israeli elections, the PNC
should set out a political manifesto on the recognition of Israel,
Le Monde said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday that
Soviet officials told Abbas it was time to take ``concrete steps
founded equally on the interests of all concerned parties, such as
those that were outlined by Mikhail Gorbachev in his meeting last
April with Yasser Arafat,'' according to Le Monde.
   In that meeting, President Gorbachev told the PLO leader that
recognition of Israel and the self-determination of the Palestinian
people were inseparable and were indispensable to the peaceful
solution to the conflict in the Middle East, Le Monde said.
   PLO officials have said Egypt and the Soviet Union were advising
the PLO to wait to launch any new initiatives until after Nov. 8,
when both Israeli and American elections will be over.

<HEAD>Eastern Caribbean Islands Issue Warning For Storm Joan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS Barbados to Grenada in 4th graf, `At noon EDT ....'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storm warnings were posted in the Lesser Antilles
today as growing Tropical Storm Joan, its top winds at 65 mph,
advanced out of the Atlantic Ocean toward the eastern Caribbean.
   The government of Barbados issued a tropical storm warning for
the islands of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and a tropical storm watch for Dominica, according to Miles
Lawrence at the National Hurricane Center.
   The government of Trinidad-Tobago issued a tropical storm
warning for Grenada and its dependencies, and the government of
France issued a tropical storm watch for the island of Martinique,
he said.
   At noon EDT, Joan was centered near latitude 12.2 north,
longitude 60.8 west, or about 70 miles east of Grenada. It was
moving a little south of due west at 12 mph, and was expected to
keep a mostly westward track through noon Saturday.
   An Air Force reconnaissance plane reported highest sustained
winds of 65 mph, higher in gusts, over a small area just north of
the center.
   Up to 10 inches of rain was possible along the path of the
storm, Lawrence said.
   Joan had started to weaken on Wednesday, forecaster Bob Case
said, but then atmospheric conditions changed and its winds picked
up to 50 mph.
   After passing near Barbados, Joan could continue to develop in
the eastern Caribbean, Case said.
   ``The environment should remain favorable, and it wouldn't be
surprising to see it do some more strengthening,'' he said.
   Joan became the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season's 10th named
system Tuesday when its winds passed the minimum 39 mph mark,
classifying it as a tropical storm.
   Four hurricanes have formed this season, including Hurricane
Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people and caused billions of
dollars damage as it ravaged Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico.
   The hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Gandhi Rules Out Lifting Ban On ``The Satanic Verses''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Friday
ruled out the idea of lifting a ban on the book ``The Satanic
Verses,'' saying he supports free expression but not if it insults
others, a news report said.
   Gandhi was responding to protests of his government's banning of
Salman Rushdie's latest novel. The book has been nominated for
Britain's highest literary award, the Booker Prize.
   The United News of India quoted Gandhi as saying he had not read
it and would not reply to a letter from Rushdie urging Gandhi to
end the ban. The prime minister spoke to reporters while touring
four flooded states in northern India.
   Rushdie, 41, is a British citizen of Indian descent and lives in
London. He won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, for his first book, ``Midnight's Children,'' a
broad satire on India after independence. His second novel,
``Shame'' also earned him acclaim.
   On Oct. 5, the Finance Ministry barred importation of the novel
or sale of it within India.
   Moslems, including members of Parliament, said they feared
Moslem militants might use the book to incite riots.
   According to UNI, Gandhi told reporters the ban was imposed
because the government believed the book might hurt the feelings of
Moslems, who make up 11 percent of India's 880 million people.
   UNI quoted Gandhi as saying that his government supports press
freedom, but that this does not warrant encroachment on sentiments
of certain communities.
   If writers do not show adequate restraint, he said, the
government must take measures ``which we generally do not want to
take,'' UNI said.
   Rushdie, a non-practicing Moslem, is sharply critical of
religious fundamentalism and makes thinly veiled references in the
book to the prophet Mohammed and the Koran.
   In his letter, which was published on the front pages of major
Indian dailies Thursday, Rushdie accused Gandhi of denying him the
right to free expression at the behest of religious zealots.
   Indian newspapers have been particularly outspoken in opposing
the ban.
   Even the Times of India, which usually supports the government,
said in an editorial today that the demand for the ban was
unjustified.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published Sept. 22 in Britain and is
scheduled to be published in the United States in February.

   A scuffle between two students over a
classroom seat prompted a two-hour riot by 2,000 residents of an
eastern Bangladesh town that injured 50, police said Friday.
   Police fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse rioters
Thursday in Brahmanbaria, 50 miles east of Dhaka, the capital. One
police officer was injured, and police patrolled three
neighborhoods to prevent more violence, authorities said.
   The incident began when two students quarreled over who would
sit on a bench in a classroom of the Sadar Government college,
police said.
   The students reported the incident to their parents, who
mobilized supporters and began fighting, authorities said.

   Fifty letters and post cards written by
Mahatma Gandhi to a student he grew to treat like a daughter have
been donated to Yale University.
   The letters and cards were the gift of Vijayaben M. Pancholi,
who began writing to Gandhi in 1935. Gandhi took her in as a
student at his ashram after several years of correspondence.
   Pravin N. Bhatt, a senior research virologist at the Yale
Medical School and a friend of Vijayaben and her husband, Manubhai,
is translating the volume into English from Gujarati, a language
spoken in western India.
   Gandhi, who advocated passive resistance, led the struggle for
India's independence from Britain.
   The letters ``are not political. They give insight into Gandhi
as a human being writing to a daughter about day-to-day things,''
Bhatt said. ``It is the story of how he took in a girl he hardly
knew and accepted her as his daughter for life.''

   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov and

appeal published Friday to save 7,000 Romanian villages from
destruction by Communist authorities.
   Sakharov and Solti were among 60 international personalities in

abandon its ``rural consolidation'' project.
   The appeal published by the conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitung
of Zurich said the plans to raze the villages, announced by
President Nicolae Ceausescu earlier this year, would destroy
``irreplaceable cultural assets.''
   The signers said the planned ``destruction threatens to
impoverish Romania and thus all of Europe.''
   Signers also included Romanian-born French playwright Eugene
Ionesco, German writer Guenter Grass, American violinist Yehudi
Menuhin and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. coordinator for aid
to Afghanistan.

   Fort Jefferson, a hexagonal, 140-year-old
fort 70 miles offshore in the Florida Straits, never faced enemy
attack but its caretakers say it is fighting a losing battle with
the U.S. Navy.
   For about two weeks, sonic booms from jet fighters on maneuvers
from the Key West Naval Air Station have rattled windows and
dislodged bricks at the fort, said Mike Finley, superintendent of
Fort Jefferson and Everglades National Park.
   Despite threats of legal action by Finley and several pleas from
Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., to reroute the flights, the Navy has no
immediate plans to alter the flight exercises.
   Capt. William Denning, head of air station at Boca Chica, said
the weather is ideal for fighter training and the fort is in the
station's radar tracking zone.
   ``The Navy is not being cavalier or thumbing our noses at what's
going on with Fort Jefferson,'' Denning said. ``We try not to go
supersonic any more than we have to.''

   The government announced the first local
elections since a 1981 military coup will be held in three stages
beginning in December.
   The government also said general elections will be in 1992.
   Emmanuel Haizel, secretary of the National Commission for
Democracy, said Wednesday the country has been divided into three
zones for the balloting, with elections scheduled Dec. 6, Jan. 31
and Feb. 28.
   Local and general elections in the former British colony of Gold
Coast were last held in June 1979. The Peoples' National Party won
the general elections and Hilla Limann became president.
   Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings toppled Limann's administration in a
coup Dec. 31, 1981, set up a Provisional National Defense Council
and banned political parties.
   In 1957, Ghana became the first British colony in Africa to gain
independence. Its three civilian and four military governments
since 1957 have ended in coups.

<TEXT>
   A man has been sentenced to 10 years in
prison for biting off and swallowing part of a police officer's ear.
   A jury took only 10 minutes to find Willie Jackson guilty
Thursday of aggravated assault on a peace officer and decided on
the maximum sentence.
   Officer Brian McNeill testified that on June 11 he stopped to
help another officer who had stopped Jackson on suspicion of
driving while intoxicated.
   Officers testified that Jackson became violent, and bit off part
of McNeill's ear while McNeill struggled to restrain him.
   Several witnesses said Jackson stuck out his tongue to show the
ear was in his mouth. A paramedic said Jackson told him he had
swallowed the piece of ear.
   Jackson, on probation at the time for attempted burglary,
testified that he bit off the ear in self-defense and that police
stopped him without cause. He has filed a $12.3 million lawsuit
charging McNeill and others used excessive force.

   Prosecutors may use a suspected Lebanese
terrorist's confession as evidence when he stands trial on charges
of leading a 1985 airline hijacking in the Middle East, a federal
appeals court ruled Friday.
   A three-judge appeals panel reversed the decision of a lower
court judge that the FBI had illegally obtained the signed
confession from Fawaz Younis about the June 11, 1985, hijacking of
a Royal Jordanian airliner.
   Younis was arrested Sept. 13, 1987, after being lured aboard an
FBI-chartered yacht off Cyprus by the prosepct of making a drug
deal. He is awaiting trial in U.S. District Court on charges he led
a group of five men who hijacked the airliner in Beirut.
   The appeals panel said it found no evidence to support U.S.
District Judge Barrington D. Parker's finding that Younis'
recurrent bouts of seasickness had impaired his understanding when
he was advised by the FBI of his right to remain silent.
   The panel rejected as ``clearly erroneous'' Parker's finding
that during the interrogation sessions aboard a Navy ship, Younis
suffered ``throbbing and numbing'' pain from wrists that were
fractured when FBI agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht.
   ``The interrogation of Younis hardly qualifies as a model for
law enforcement behavior,'' Circuit Judge Abner Mikva wrote for the
panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here. ``But the
Constitution does not require picture-perfect routines.''
   ``Younis' physical circumstances at the time that he waived his
Miranda rights may well have been uncomfortable, and his sudden
arrest no doubt took him by surprise,'' the court said.
   ``The FBI agents might well have used less force in arresting
Younis (so as not to have fractured his wrists); they could have
also been more solicitous of Younis' welfare following arrest (for
example by giving him medication against nausea right away).
   ``But discomfort and surprise, by themselves, have never
sufficed to render a waiver unknowing and involuntary _ provided
that police administer proper warnings and do not engage in
intimidation, coercion or deception,'' Mikva said in an opinion
joined by Circuit Judges James L. Buckley and Douglas H. Ginsburg.
   Parker, who sharply criticized the FBI's tactics, had suppressed
the confession as evidence last February, prompting an appeal by
federal prosecutors that has delayed the trial, now scheduled to
begin Nov. 14.
   The appeals court concluded that the FBI properly advised Younis
of his constitutional rights under the procedure mandated by the
Supreme Court's landmark Miranda decision in 1966.
   Each time Younis complained of seasickness, the interrogation
was stopped so the suspect could rest, the court noted.
   ``Younis not only said that he understood the warnings and
agreed to waive the rights contained therein but proceeded to
recount his participation in the hijacking,'' the court said.
   ``Assessing the totality of the circumstances, we cannot
conclude that Younis' waiver was invalid,'' the court said.
   Following his arrest aboard the yacht, Younis was transferred to
the USS Butte, on which he was interrogated during a four-day
voyage before he was flown to Washington.
   Younis, a former member of the Shiite Amal militia, is accused
of leading the group of five men who stormed the Royal Jordanian
airliner with AK-47 assault rifles at Beirut International Airport.
   The hijackers forced the airliner to fly to several locations in
the Mediterranean, including Cyprus and Sicily, before the plane
returned to Beirut 30 hours later.
   After the airliner's 74 passengers and crew members were
released, the hijackers blew up the plane on the runway.
   Besides the confession, federal prosecutors have a videotape of
a man identified as Younis reading a statement to reporters at the
airport. The tape shows the plane being blown up in the background.
   The hijackers, seeking to force the Arab League to remove
Palestinian refugees from Lebanon, ordered the plane to fly to
Tunis, Tunisia, where the organization was meeting. Tunisian
authorities refused to allow the plane to land there.

   A 9-year-old deaf and retarded
student died after being severely scalded in a shower while left
unattended with two other disabled students at the Florida School
for the Deaf and Blind, police said.
   The youngster was put on a toilet for potty training Thursday
and two older deaf and retarded students were told to watch her,
said police Sgt. Bruce Bennett.
   Witnesses told police the child began vomiting and ran alone
into the shower. The other two girls, ages 17 and 12, found her a
few minutes later.
   The girl was declared dead at Flagler Hospital in St. Augustine,
but there was no immediate ruling on an official cause of death and
police continued investigating, Bennett said.

   Bits of $10 and $20 bills fluttered
through the air when authorities, suspecting they had found bombs,
blew up a piece of pipe that turned out to be filled with money.
   ``I think there was several people there that were quite
surprised,'' police spokesman Neal Jacobson said Friday of
Thursday's incident.
   An arson team found two sealed metal tubes, about 18 inches long
and capped on both ends, while investigating a house fire. One of
the tubes contained several hundred dollars, said another police
spokesman, Art Wright.
   ``These had the appearance and dimensions to make people think
they were a bomb when in fact they weren't,'' Jacobson said. ``Our
concern was safety of people and property first.''
   Police summoned an Army bomb squad, which used explosives to
destroy the tubes.
   Wright said the pipes apparently were left behind by a previous
resident of the house.

<TEXT>
   With just three and a half weeks to go until
the presidential election, Democrat Michael Dukakis may have lost
his last best chance to overtake Vice President George Bush.
   The opportunities and potential surprises of the debates are
over, and the 1988 campaign entered its final phase on Friday with
the guideposts from now until Election Day clearly marked.
   From now on, campaign packaging will assert an even stronger
hold, with schedules and rhetoric more tightly controlled than
before _ and that should benefit Bush and make it even harder for
Dukakis to find an opening to turn the tide of the campaign.
   Even Dukakis' people conceded after Thursday's encounter at UCLA
that the Massachusetts governor did not deliver the leveling blow
that some had hoped for.
   ``We didn't expect a knockout. What we expected was a strong
effort,'' said campaign manager Susan Estrich.
   But whether that effort will be enough to make much difference
in the dwindling days remaining, for a campaign that has been
lagging in the polls since late August, seemed questionable.
   The vice president _ described by aide Sheila Tate as ``good at
dodging and weaving'' _ might have gloated that Dukakis didn't lay
a glove on him, the phrase he had used after his on-air spat with
CBS' Dan Rather last winter.
   Instead, Bush merely said he was ``very happy about the way
things went.'' He had aides pronounce the victory for him.
   For Bush, the stakes weren't as high as for Dukakis in
Thursday's jousting; he only had to avoid making serious mistakes.
   Most analysts seemed to agree that Bush looked more comfortable,
Dukakis stiffer in the final debate, with no major gaffes on either
side.
   For his part, Dukais was supposed to try to look warmer, more
human.
   And, in fact, both candidates seemed to be seeking
less-negative, more-open images _ although Bush aides denied that
Dukakis had scored many points in the Miss Congeniality contest.
   ``I think I'm a reasonably likable guy,'' Dukakis told an
audience estimated at a bit more than 60 million. ``But I'm also a
serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is a very
serious office.''
   Bush, who polls show has overcome most of the earlier perception
of him as being aloof and ``wimpish,'' had his own words on the
issue of likability.
   ``I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or
not to make you an effective leader. I think it's whether you share
the broad dreams of the American people. I think it's a question of
values, not likability or lovability.''
   Bush aides before the debate said they expected some kind of
surprise assault from the Democrat. But it never materialized.
   And what may have been Dukakis' harshest thrust, his criticism
of Republican running mate Sen. Dan Quayle, who polls have shown is
hurting the GOP ticket, brought what may have been a neutralizing
parry from Bush.
   ``I've never seen a campaign where a presidential nominee runs
against my vice presidential nominee,'' he said.
   From now on, Dukakis will have to look even harder for something
dramatic to turn around his campaign in a year in which even Bush
contends political activity so far has generated ``more heat than
light.''
   With no more debates planned, and with polls suggesting Bush is
in good shape to win an Electoral-College majority, Dukakis' work
appears to be cut out for him.

<HEAD>Election Official Bans Party Ad Featuring Arafat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A campaign commercial featuring an interview
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat was banned Friday by an election
official on the grounds it violated anti-terrorism laws, the
producer of the advertisement said.
   The two-minute commercial for the left-wing Progressive List for
Peace shows Arafat saying: ``I accept (Israel's) international
legitimacy.... I accept U.N. resolutions 242 and 338.''
   Israel has said it will not negotiate with the PLO unless it
accepts the two U.N. resolutions, which recognize the Jewish
state's sovereignty and call for Israel to withdraw from territory
occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Progressive List for Peace will appeal the decision to the
Supreme Court on Sunday, party spokesman Adam Keller said.
   ``It's nonsense to say that showing a Palestinian speaking about
peace violates a law against terrorism,'' Keller said, noting that
the right-wing Likud party was permitted to use an ad showing a
1970 film of Arafat with a machine gun.
   ``It's unreasonable that the Likud can show him as a war-monger
and we can't show the other side of the coin,'' Keller said. ``We
had hoped to break the monstrous image given to the PLO by the
official propaganda in Israel.''
   Israel's law against terrorism forbids public identification
with a terrorist organization.
   Under Israeli election laws, all campaign commercials must be
approved for airing by the Central Elections Committee. The
committee has representatives of all parties, but its chairman,
always a Supreme Court judge, rules on the ads.
   Eyal Sivan, the commercial's producer, said he was told by the
office of Judge Eliezer Goldberg, the committee chairman, that
portions of the ad with interviews of Arafat and other PLO members
were banned.
   Sivan said the party will air the ad Saturday night with all but
the last 30 seconds blacked out.
   ``From our point of view, this is more proof that Israeli
officials are not interested in peace with the Palestinian
people,'' Sivan said.
   Keller said the commercial, which shows a closeup of Arafat
sitting on a sofa, was taped a few weeks ago but he would not say
where.
   The ad also quotes Khaled El Hassan, a member of the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, as saying: ``We don't want to throw anybody
into the sea. ... We want peace.''
   The Progressive List, which currently holds two seats in the
Israeli Parliament, favors negotiations with the PLO and advocates
a withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   Israeli policy in the occupied territories, where more than 290
Palestinians have been killed in a 10-month-old uprising, is a key
issue in the Nov. 1 national elections.
   Right-wing parties, lead by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Likud bloc, are trying to convince the Supreme Court to disqualify
the Progressive List from the elections on grounds it threatens
Israel's existence.

<HEAD>Networks Sue To Overturn Wyoming Polling Restrictions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three television networks have filed suit
against Wyoming's restrictions on voter canvassing, arguing they
unconstitutionally hamper coverage of the political process.
   NBC, CBS and ABC charge the law unfairly prohibits them from
reporting on how and why people voted the way they did, according
to the lawsuit.
   The networks also are prevented from identifying and commenting
on ``social and political trends,'' said the suit, filed Thursday
in federal court.
   State officials were unsure this morning how they would respond.
   A similar lawsuit filed in Washington state three years ago
resulted in a similar restriction against exit polling being
overturned.
   Wyoming's law, adopted in 1983, bans voter canvassing within 100
yards of buildings holding polling stations. It also prohibits any
kind of campaigning within that zone and carries a possible $1,000
fine or six-month jail sentence for those who violate the statute.
   But such restrictions violate the First Amendment to the
Constitution as made applicable to the states through the 14th
Amendment, the networks' lawsuit contends.
   Unless the law is overturned, the networks claim, they will be
prevented from ``gathering and reporting truthful and significant
information about the political process to the public.''
   The law was designed to minimize distractions at polling places,
according to Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, who along with
Wyoming Attorney General Joe Meyer was named as defendant in the
case.
   ``You want to have adequate voting, you want to have that line
moving along, you want to neutralize that zone,'' she said.
   Karpan, who received notice of the suit this morning, wasn't
surprised by it.
   ``I'm aware of challenges in other states. It's been something
that we were rather braced for,'' she said.
   Karpan did not, however, know how the state would respond to the
lawsuit since she had not consulted with the attorney general.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis headed into
the stretch run of their White House campaign today, the vice
president's advisers ecstatic with his highly rated debate
performance and Dukakis conceding ``the road ahead of us is going
to be tough.''
   ``We have 25 days,'' Dukakis said, ``25 of the most important
days in the political history of this country.'' He spoke today to
a group of black ministers after an introduction by former
Democratic rival Jesse Jackson, who urged the ministers to help get
out the vote for Dukakis.
   Instant debate polls gave a clear edge to Bush after his 90
minutes on stage with Dukakis Thursday night.
   An ABC News survey called the vice president the winner, by 49
percent to 33 percent and a Los Angeles Times poll had it 47 to 26
with the rest unsure. An Associated Press panel of debate judges
also rated Bush the winner, reversing the judgment from the first
debate Sept. 25 when Dukakis was perceived the victor.
   Bush supporters used the morning TV talk shows to declare the
battle all but won.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said on NBC's ``Today'' program, ``If
I were working for Michael Dukakis I'd be sending out resumes this
morning.''
   Not so fast, countered Dukakis' closest aide, John Sasso.
   He said the Massachusetts governor ``scored with undecided and
swing voters last evening'' in the second and final debate of the
campaign. ``That's what we were looking for.''
   Sasso conceded that the Democrat trails in the polls, but he
said, ``It's well within range'' and announced new television
advertisements featuring the candidate talking in his shirtsleeves
about campaign concerns.
   Dukakis and Bush both arranged to campaign during the day in
California, the biggest electoral-vote state and a tossup in all
the polls, the Democrat with running mate Lloyd Bentsen at his side.
   Bush's Republican running mate Dan Quayle showed the GOP
elation. ``Say good night Mike,'' he said at a Thursday night rally.
   Neither candidate was up and out in public early today after
attending post-debate rallies.
   ``I'm happy with the way it came out,'' a grinning Bush said
Thursday night en route to a post-debate rally. Democrats were
guarded in their assessments and acknowledged that Dukakis did not
land a knockout blow.
   However, Dukakis claimed victory and said the race was ``very,
very close and it's going to get even closer after tonight.''
Dukakis had gone into the debate on the UCLA campus hoping to
shorten Bush's lead in the polls, while the vice president was
looking to move further ahead.
   Once and for all, Bush declared there would not be a third
debate, saying, ``People have had it up to here with debates.''
   Dukakis told a post-debate rally, ``I think we ought to have
that third debate, don't you? We've gotten the Republicans out from
behind the flag factory and the balloons and discussing the issues.
That's why debates are so important.''
   Before a prime-time television audience of tens of millions of
people, Bush and Dukakis traded blows over Social Security,
abortion, the death penalty, the qualifications of their running
mates and national defense.
   Amid the battle over issues, there also was a contest to
demonstrate personal warmth and likability.
   Dukakis, who has been criticized as being too controlled and
unemotional, was asked to address the question of his affability.
``I think I'm a reasonably likable guy,'' he said. ``I'm serious _
though I think I'm a little more lovable thse days than I used to
be back in my youth when I began in the state legislature.''
   Bush, sparring with the panel of debate questioners, was playful
at times, reacting in mock horror when asked if his running mate,
Dan Quayle, were qualified to take over if Bush were assassinated.
   More seriously, Bush said ``I'd have confidence in him. And I
made a good selection.'' Polls indicate that Quayle has been a drag
on the Republican ticket.
   There also were moments of poignancy. Both men talked of losing
a child, Bush a daughter to leukemia and Dukakis a child 20 minutes
after it was born.
   Defending himself against charges he was running a negative
campaign, Bush said, ``I have defined the issues and I am not going
to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining
some of these very liberal positions, he's the one, a liberal,
traditional liberal, a progressive liberal Democrat.''
   Dukakis shot back: ``In 1980 President Reagan called you a
liberal for voting for federal gun control. ... But let's stop
labeling each other and let's get to the heart of the matter which
is the future of this country.''
   Accusing Bush of changing positions of Social Security, the
environment and ethics in government, Dukakis said, ``I don't know
which George Bush I'm listening to.''
   Bush promised that e would never cut Social Security. Dukakis
noted that the administration had tried to do just that, and said,
``I'm sure you'll try to do it again.''
   Bush said that as president he would not have any conservative
litmus test for Supreme Court justices. He also noted that he
supported President Reagan's controversial selection of
conservative Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, which was
rejected by the Senate.
   Dukakis responded, ``If the vice president of the United States
thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment that is a
very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis on the 8th of November.
   Challenging the administration on foreign policy, Dukakis said,
``let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed
policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.''
   Responding, Bush said that ``the policy in Central America,
regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to
support those who have been fighting for freedom.''
   On national defense, Dukakis said ``there's no way that we can
build all of the weapons the vice president says he wants to build
within the defense budget.'' Bush criticized Dukakis for supporting
a nuclear weapons freeze in the early 1980s and, in a slap at his
rival's inexperience in foreign policy, said ``You just don't make
unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to
behave themselves.''

<HEAD>Egyptian Writer's Award Seen As Incentive To Mideast Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The awarding of the Nobel Prize for
literature to Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz is being interpreted
as a boost for Arab-Israeli relations and a good omen for Middle
East peace.
   The 76-year-old author, who on Thursday became the first Arab
writer to win the award, has been attacked in the past for
supporting the U.S.-brokered Camp David agreement between Egypt and
Israel.
   Egyptians compare Mahfouz with England's Charles Dickens and
France's Victor Hugo.
   But he calls himself only a ``third-rate writer,'' naming
William Shakespeare and Leo Tolstoy as first-rate writers, and
Dickens and George Bernard Shaw as second-rate.
   Mahfouz's admirers laud his stubborn advocacy of the ideals of
democracy.
   While his critics speak out openly, his supporters seek
anonymity, saying the movement for peace in the Middle East remains
largely defenseless against terrorist violence and political
maneuvering.
   ``Mahfouz's glorious gain will fire the minds of generations of
Arab writers to emulate his example and stress Arab-Jewish peace,''
said one admirer, a highly placed Arab official.
   The Swedish Academy said that Mahfouz's work, which includes 40
novels, had advanced the art of the novel, a relatively new genre
in Arabic literature.
   Several Arab writers contended that Mahfouz was favored for the
prize because of writings that allegedly are pro-Israeli. Jordanian
novelist Fakhry Kaawar insisted that Mahfouz had ``contributed
greatly to push Zionism.''
   Many Arab intellectuals believe the Swedish Nobel Prize
committee comes under a strong Jewish influence.
   Bahrain's information minister, Tariq al-Moayyed, said Mahfouz's
award was a source of pride for Egypt and all Arabs.
   After decrying the monarchy of King Farouk and the British
occupation of Egypt in his early books, Mahfouz resorted to
allegory to condemn dictatorial practices in his country that were
being justified on nationalistic grounds.
   He never accorded the late King Farouk any praise.
   At one point, Mahfouz lamented Egypt's loss of identity,
depicting the nation in a novel called ``The Road'' as an
illegimate boy moving from a small town to the crowded capital in
search of his father. The boy aimlessly roams through Cairo, turns
into a criminal and ends up dying on the gallows.
   In another novel, ``Miramar,'' Mahfouz took a more obvious swipe
at dictatorship, portraying Egypt as a maid at a boarding house
called Miramar, with a clientele of suitors representing former
feudalists, emerging revolutionaries, counterrevolutionaries and
opportunists.
   The maid rejects all the suitors as deceitful and awards her
favors to a poor but honest newspaper delivery boy.
   After the defeat of the Arabs in the 1967 war with Israel,
Mahfouz almost totally shed his allegory and confronted Gamal Abdel
Nasser's police state more directly.
   ``Al-Karnak,'' a novel about arrests and torture of decent
Egyptians by hated intelligence officers, has a theme that carries
echoes of the Gestapo in Nazi Germany.
   One novel cited by the Nobel judges is ``Children of Gebelawi,''
written in 1959 and still banned in Egypt. The characters are based
on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and a modern scientist.
   The Swedish Academy described it as an ``allegory of humanity's
historic destiny under the great monotheistic founders of
religion.''
   Mahfouz's firm belief in the oneness of humanity is the basis of
his support for ending centuries of Arab hatred of the Jews.
   But he also insists that the Palestinians should be allowed to
carve out their own destiny in an independent state.

   U.S. military officials outlined
plans Friday for turning rocket launchers into scrap under the
U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Starting Wednesday, torches and electric saws will cut in half
the first nine of the Pershing 2 launchers at a U.S. Army site in
the Hausen section of northwest Frankfurt.
   Work crews will don welding suits and helmets, safety glasses,
leather gloves and safety shoes, said Chief Warrant Officer Richard
Moore.
   U.S. and Soviet experts, wearing hards hats and goggles, will
watch from behind a glassed-in partition about four yards away, the
site supervisor told a news briefing.
   Late Friday, the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart said the
team of Soviet inspectors would arrive in Frankfurt Monday. It did
not say how many Soviets were expected.
   All 114 of the Pershing 2 rocket launchers stationed in West
Germany will be destroyed in Hausen within a three-year period,
said site commander Christopher Evans.
   The launchers themselves are flatbed trucks outfitted with beams
designed to raise the missiles into a vertical position for firing.
The launchers were designed for both transport and firing of the
mobile rockets, and each is about 31 feet long.
   Evans, a civilian employee of the Army, stressed that the
missiles themselves were being taken back to the United States.
   ``I would like to emphasize that this facility has nothing to do
with the actual missile and never has had,'' Evans told reporters
invited to the pre-destruction briefing. ``This facility only works
with the launchers and ground support equipment.''
   Evans said the launchers will be brought one by one into a
covered work area, where the trailer part and the erector mechanism
will be cut in half.
   The work will take about two days for all nine launchers, and
the remains will be taken to a facility in suburban Frankfurt to be
used as scrap metal, he said.
   ``All personnel involved have the proper training and
certification and there is no, I repeat, no adverse environmental
impact,'' Evans said.
   The first nine launchers to be destroyed were stationed at a
base near Stuttgart and were hauled away along with the missiles
Sept. 1. That was the first U.S. missile removal under the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty signed by President Reagan
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December.
   U.S. officials said in September the remaining 420
intermediate-range U.S. missiles will be removed from Western
Europe over a 36-month period. Of the missiles deployed, 108
Pershing 2 missiles and 96 cruise missiles were stationed at four
bases in West Germany.
   Stationing of the missiles had sparked massive protests in
Western Europe, including a coordinated demonstration in several
cities that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets in
October 1983. Deployment of the missiles began the following month.
   The Soviet Union began removing its missiles from Czechoslovakia
and East Germany in February, before the U.S. Senate ratified the
treaty.
   Under the treaty, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed
to eliminate all land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
which have ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles.

   President Daniel arap Moi on Friday marked
his 10th year in power with a warning that the next decade will
bring population growth certain to strain the nation's resources.
   ``The era of soft options is over,'' said Moi, who became
Kenya's second president in 1978 after the death of his
predecessor, Jomo Kenyatta. Moi was Kenyatta's vice president for
11 years.
   Moi also hinted that the current crackdown on alleged dissidents
will continue.
   ``No government can stay idle when the security of the state is
threatened,'' he said.
   Moi cut into a 10-tiered cake and then spoke at the ceremony
marking the end of a week of celebrations.
   Presidents Siad Barre of Somalia, Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania,
Joachim Chissano of Mozambique, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and Juvenal Habriyamana of Rwanda were the
principal foreign guests.
   Moi said Kenya's 22 million population will be more than 30
million by 1999. It is the world's fastest growing population, with
an annual growth rate of 3.9 percent.
   ``Let us not be complacent about the implications of these
numbers,'' Moi said. ``They mean we must provide more jobs, more
schools, more hospitals and, above all, more food for this fast
growing population.''
   The economy, Moi said, must continue to grow faster than the
population. The economy is expanding by almost 5 percent annually.
   He promised the government would provide incentives for foreign
investors and streamline laws to make industry profitable, but he
did not elaborate. Foreign investment in Kenya has been declining
since the mid-1970s.
   Moi, however, warned industrialists ``to avoid the temptation of
trying to make quick and unwarranted profits because of the new
policies we are introducing.''
   ``We have no intention of creating a nation of a few Kenyans
amidst a sea of poverty,'' said Moi.
   On the issue of national security, Moi said the country was
ready to meet any challenge to maintain its peace and stability.
   Authorities in the last five weeks have detained four people
under security laws that allow for indefinite imprisonment without
charge or trial.
   Since Aug. 8, four people have been sentenced to seven-year jail
terms after confessing to belonging to groups seeking Moi's ouster.
   The government revealed the existence of the Kenya Revolutionary
Movement and another group, the Kenya Patriotic Front, on Sept. 16.
It claims the core of the Kenya Patriotic Front are former members
of Mwakenya, an underground movement.
   ``Let such people make no mistake, for we shall meet their
challenge with all the appropriate means at our disposal,'' Moi
said.
   Moi delivered his speech after three hours of entertainment that
included a military parade, an air force aerial display,
traditional dance troupes, and songs by children born Oct. 14,
1978, the day Moi was sworn in for his first full term.
   The government built a $950,000 monument downtown to mark the
10th anniversary of Moi's rule.

   The government has expelled a member of
the Soviet trade delegation who was suspected of industrial
espionage, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
   The Soviet delegate left last week, said ministry spokesman
Martin Hallqvist. He declined to identify him.
   ``He tried to get information about Swedish and foreign economic
and industrial conditions,'' the spokesman said.
   No further information was released on the delegate's
activities, but Hallqvist said he was caught before Swedish
interests could be harmed.
   Since spring 1987, the government has granted visas to 10 Soviet
and Eastern European diplomats who were indentified by the Swedish
security police as intelligence officers, the national news agency
TT said.

   A city electrician with a history of
emotional problems walked into a work meeting today with a gun and
shot two of his supervisors, then shot and killed himself, police
and colleagues said.
   Vladimir `Walter' Kozubov, who worked for the city since Oct.
15, 1979, had threatened in the past to shoot up his office, a
co-worker said. He had recently returned from a leave of absence
and seemed upset over job-related situations, colleagues said.
   The wounded men were identified as Tom Darden and Richard
Pennock. Stanford Hospital spokesman Karl Knapper said one man was
in critical condition and undergoing surgery, while the other was
in guarded condition.
   City electrical assistant Ken Schwab told the Palo Alto Times
Tribune that he and about nine other electrical substation workers
sat down at about 6:50 a.m. to discuss morning assignments when
Kozubov came in with a small-caliber handgun and began shooting.
   ``I got under the table as fast as I could. As soon as I saw
Walter hit the ground, I got out and called the police,'' Schwab
said.
   Schwab stood outside the fenced-in control center trying to calm
coworkers, including one with bloodstains on his shoes and jeans.
   ``I am just glad I wasn't in the line of fire,'' he said. ``I
think it will all sink in later.''
   Debra D'Alessandro, an electrical department employee, said she
was walking into the center when somebody stopped her. ``They said,
`Don't go in there, Vlad has a gun and he is going nuts,'''
Alessandro said. She said Kozubov had made threats in the past.
   ``He had not threatened with a gun before, but he has threatened
that he would come out and shoot up the place,'' she said.
   Bob Britton, field representative for the Service Employees
International Union that represents the electrical workers, said he
had been trying to help Kozubov work things out.
   ``He had a temper,'' Britton said. ``I was trying to get him to
work on his temper, trying to get him to use the union to deal with
his problems.''
   Britton said Kozubov took a two-month leave of absence a year
ago.
   Schwab said Kozubov had been back to work about a month, ``but
he still seemed agitated about something.''

   It isn't kosher for police to deny Effie
Sharabi a permit to sell his hot dogs on the streets of San
Francisco, the Israeli immigrant is telling City Hall.
   ``In the summertime, there are so many Jewish tourists, and
there is no place to get a kosher meal,'' Sharabi said.
   The Police Permit Bureau, however, noted that an ordinance bars
a pushcart within two blocks of a restaurant that sells similar
food.
   ``Our contention is that a hot dog is a hot dog is a hot dog,''
said Lt. Harlan Wilson, commanding officer of the permit bureau.
``What if a Roman Catholic priest walks by, throws holy water on
(hot dogs) and calls them holy dogs?''
   Sharabi said he'll go before the Board of Permit Appeals on Nov.
14, flanked by a lawyer and two rabbis. His opponents not only
include the police, but some neighborhood merchants.
   Jill Hollander, whose Findley's Fabulous Fudge on Geary Street
would be a knish-throw from the pushcart, said the smell of hog
dogs outside her place would repel fudge lovers.
   Sharabi allowed that he might lose his kosher crusade, but he
added that he intends to give it a good try.
   ``What can it hurt?'' he shrugged.

   That wasn't an unidentified flying object
in the sky, just Wolf's Furniture store on the ground.
   State police in Greensburg and others said they received several
calls Thursday night about bright beams of light darting across the
sky near U.S. 30 in Hempfield Township.
   Stan Gordon, a member of the Pennsylvania Society for the Study
of the Unexplained, said many who called him thought they had seen
unidentified flying objects.
   Gordon said the phenomenon was caused by four powerful search
lights owned by Ohio Valley Skytrackers at the opening of Wolf's
Furniture store in a shopping mall.

   In 1984, Democratic vice presidential
nominee Geraldine Ferraro explained about ``those Italian men.''
Now one of the best known, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, may have
turned the tables.
   While introducing Cuomo at a Democratic fund-raiser Thursday
evening, former Monroe County Democratic Chairman Mike Miller noted
that two years ago a magazine had proclaimed the New York governor,
at age 54, among the country's 10 sexiest men.
   Miller, 49, said that ``honor'' was inspiring to all men who
were approaching that age. The governor said he saw things somewhat
differently.
   ``I've been married to a Sicilian for 34 years,'' Cuomo told
several hundred people at the crowded cocktail reception. ``And
when you've been married to a Sicilian for 34 years, you're not
talking about being sexy. You talk about survival.''
   The parents of Matilda Cuomo, the governor's wife, are from
Sicily.
   Later, on a flight back to Albany, Cuomo said he had meant it
all in jest.

   Mike and Debi Herren wanted to be
farmers, but were looking to raise ``something different and
something simple that would allow us to get on our feet.''
   They settled on snails, or ``escargot'' if you meet one in a
French restaurant.
   The Herrens, both 26, also tend buffalo on their 176-acre farm.
   Raising snails in Illinois is tricky because of the weather,
Herren said.
   ``Cold weather is the biggest problem,'' he said. ``In
California they can be raised in the open or in greenhouses, but
here you can't do that.''
   The Herrens raise their snails in a limestone basement of a
farmhouse where they can keep the temperature constant. ``Between
70 and 80 degrees is the optimum temperature,'' he said.
   ``Snails are deaf and blind, but need sunlight to reproduce,''
Herren said. Artificial light, fortunately, also gets their juices
flowing.
   ``The snails have been a piece of cake,'' Herren says. ``Well,
maybe I shouldn't say that because we both grew up on farms and so
we're used to working hard.''

   A bomb exploded in a concrete
trash bin at a downtown bus station Friday evening, hurling
shrapnel that injured four people, police said.
   The 6:30 p.m. blast damaged two cars and a bus, shattered nearby
shop windows, and wrecked a bus inspector's office at the Van der
Bijl Plaza bus station, said police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe.
   On Sept. 20, a bomb at the bus station injured 19 people.
   There have been more than 150 bombings in South Africa since a
national state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986. More than
30 people have died and more than 600 have been injured.
   The bombings have increased recently, with an average of nearly
one a day since the beginning of September.
   The government says the outlawed African National Congress is
waging a bombing campaign leading up to the municipal elections for
segregated local councils on Oct. 26. But there have also been an
increasing number of attacks and bombings of anti-apartheid
organizations which the ANC has blamed on the government's security
forces.

   Retail sales in September dropped for the
second consecutive month, the government said Friday, confirming
economists' view that the confidence of American consumers is
slipping.
   The Commerce Department said sales fell 0.4 percent last month
to a seasonally adjusted $133.7 billion. That followed a dip of 0.1
percent in August and was the first back-to-back drop since
September-October 1987.
   The government data is consistent with a survey earlier this
week for The Conference Board, a business research organization,
finding that consumer confidence last month suffered the sharpest
decline since the October stock market crash.
   ``Consumers are just very cautious. They're worried about where
the economy is going and they're probably right,'' said Michael K.
Evans, an economic consultant in Washington. ``I think higher
interest rates are a factor and I think fear of the future is a
factor. People are wondering what the next administration will
bring.''
   The September drop suprised many economists, who were expecting
a modest increase of between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. But they say the
declines are a welcome development because weaker consumer demand
eases inflation pressure on prices.
   Bond market in early trading Friday reacted favorably to the
sales report. Traders believe weak sales mean less inflation and
thus less upward pressure on interest rates.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities dealer in New York, said slower economic
growth means the Federal Reserve Board should be able to keep
interest rates stable over the next month or two. Earlier this year
it had been pushing up rates to fight inflation.
   There's been a pause in the economy, ``but it could be the pause
that refreshes and extends the expansion,'' he said.
   However, some analysts, such as Robert Brusca of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc., note that early estimates of
retail sales are frequently revised.
   Brusca said the government figures showing that both auto and
food sales declined are suspect. Auto manufacturers reported strong
sales in September and food sales ought to have risen in a
reflection of drought-caused price increases, he said.
   ``This report is one great big candidate for revision,'' he said.
   The Commerce Department said auto sales fell 1.9 percent in
September to a seasonally adjusted $28.7 billion, following a 2.2
percent tumble in August.
   Excluding the automotive category, which tends to make wide
monthly swings, sales were unchanged following a 0.5 percent rise a
month earlier.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores
rebounded in September by 0.6 percent to $15.2 billion. August
sales were off by 0.4 percent, mostly because of unusually hot
weather.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, were down 1.0 percent, entirely because of the
automotive decline.
   Furniture sales were up 0.4 percent in September after holding
steady in August. Sales at building supply, hardware and garden
stores were up 1.1 percent following a 0.4 percent rise a month
earlier.
   Sales of non-durable goods were unchanged in September, with
declines at food stores and gasoline stations offsetting gains
elsewhere.
   Food and grocery stores posted a 0.4 percent drop, and gasoline
sales were off by 0.2 percent, a reflection of price declines.
   However, sales at restaurants and bars rose 0.8 percent; at
specialty clothing shops, 0.7 percent, and at drug stores, 0.5
percent.
   For the first nine months of the year, overall retail sales rose
5.9 percent over the same period in 1987, barely better than the
4.6 percent rate of inflation.

   The yen is strong and the dollar is weak, and
salmon fanciers in the Northwest are paying for this lesson in
international economics at the fish counter.
   ``It's outrageous,'' said John Russell of Pure Food Fish in
Seattle's Pike Place Market where fresh chinook, or king, salmon
steaks and filets that sold a year ago for $4.95 and $5.95 a pound
now run $7.95 to $8.95, Russell said.
   ``I think you can safely say that Japan is setting the market
for the species that are valued over there, especially the reds (or
sockeye) and chum (sometimes called keta or brites),'' said Lee
Alvorsen of Northwest Resources Consultants.
   The bad news for consumers has been good news for Northwest
fishermen, who have been netting many more dollars for the same
amount of work.
   With rising demand but no increase in the harvest, the Japanese
have begun buying other species as well, raising the possibility
that salmon could be priced off many tables in the Northwest. In
other parts of the country where salmon are shipped, price
increases could be even higher, Alvorsen said.
   ``They're basically buying them for 50-cent dollars,'' said Alec
Brindle, president of Ward Cove Packing Co. Inc.
   Kings, frequently 20 pounds or larger, and the darker sockeye,
usually around six pounds, are prized for their oily, succulent
flesh.
   Coho, or silver, range from small to intermediate in size and
are less oily, while chum, intermediate in size, are drier still.
Pinks or humpys, the smallest, run around four pounds and have the
driest and lightest colored flesh. Pinks and sockeye are the most
numerous.
   Some restaurants renowned for their fish dishes have dropped
certain kinds of salmon.
   At Ray's Boathouse, executive chef Wayne Ludvigsen said he quit
buying sockeye rather than boost the menu price to $18 or $19. He
had charged $13 or $14 the past few years.
   ``I don't know of anybody else who has it on the menu,''
Ludvigsen said.
   ``It's become a bad value,'' he said. ``It's almost that the
market was so strong ... that quality was not the thing, just
getting the fish was the thing.''
   ``We're reaching price levels that we've never seen before, so
nobody really knows what the ceiling is,'' said Bruce Gore,
Ludvigsen's supplier of king salmon that runs $16.95 a plate.
   Gore, who fishes, cleans and flash-freezes fish at sea from 10
other boats and sells about 200,000 to 250,000 pounds a year to
retailers and restaurants, predicted top-quality frozen salmon
would reach $10 to $12 a pound at the counter this winter.
   ``A growing percentage of people are just going to buy chicken
instead,'' he said.
   ``Salmon has probably escalated as fast or faster than any
seafood,'' said Tom Dehn, special seafood merchandizer at Pacific
Fish Co.
   Japanese buying was the main reason for the record $705 million
paid to commercial fishermen for a so-so Alaska salmon catch of
99.5 million fish this year.
   Salmon hauled aboard boats from Washington state brought fishing
crews about $240 million and processors $525 million for 67,000
metric tons of fish this year, compared with $135 million and $297
million, respectively, for 66,000 tons in the previous season,
Alvorsen said.
   Alvorsen said salmon prices pretty much rose with the rise of
the yen, coupled with a falloff from record catches of the
mid-1980s and declining frozen and canned inventories.
   Chuck Meachum, Alaska Department of Fish and Game research
supervisor for the Bristol Bay region, said the transition from
canning chiefly for European countries to freezing overwhelmingly
for the Japanese had resulted in ``a very, very strong correlation
... between the price U.S. fishermen are paid and the U.S.-Japan
exchange rate.''
   Fishermen received an average of $1.40 a pound for 15.8 million
Bristol Bay reds in 1986, when the yen was worth about 170 per
dollar, and $2 a pound for 16.6 million fish this year, with the
yen at 133 per dollar as of Friday.

   Americans sympathize with AIDS patients, but
only if they got the disease through some means other than
homosexual activity or drug use, according to a poll published
Friday.
   Seventy-five percent of those surveyed for a New York Times-CBS
News poll said they have a lot or some sympathy for people with
AIDS, while only 19 percent said they had not much or no sympathy.
   But when asked about the two groups that comprise the majority
of AIDS patients, much of the sympathy evaporated, apparently
reflecting public dislike of homosexuals and drug users.
   Only 36 percent said they had a lot or some sympathy for those
who got the disease through homosexual activity, and only 26
percent had sympathy for those who got AIDS through intravenous
drug use.
   Homosexuals and drug users make up the overwhelming majority of
people with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   A total of 1,606 respondents were interviewed by telephone Sept.
8 to 11. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.

   Multimillionaire Malcolm S. Forbes was
formally dressed in the requisite pin-striped suit, but he
approached the question of business success with informal humor and
a bit of irreverence.
   ``If it's not too late, pick out parents who are in business,''
Forbes told students at Adams State College Thursday. ``So when
they die ... then you're in business.''
   Forbes, 69, was at Adams State to collect an honorary degree as
this year's Distinguished Executive in Residence _ a role he
fulfilled with his talk.
   ``I didn't balloon in, but as you'll soon find out, I brought
the hot air with me,'' Forbes said.
   Forbes, editor in chief of the business magazine that bears his
name, has made headlines for everything from escorting actress
Elizabeth Taylor to piloting a hot air balloon into a high-security
Chinese military base.
   In the animated talk to more than 600 people he spoke of the
promise he sees in the decline of communism and the ``breaking out
of peace.''
   ``The American economy is in such extraordinarily good shape
that we can withstand either one of these guys getting elected,''
he said, commenting on presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and
George Bush.

   Olympic weightlifting champion Naim
Suleymanoglu was joined in Turkey Friday by his family, which was
finally allowed out of Bulgaria, state radio reported.
   Suleymanoglu, an ethnic Turk, defected to Turkey two years ago.
He won the country's first gold medal in 20 years in the Seoul
Olympics last month, breaking a world record by lifting 342.5
kilograms.
   The semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported that

   Nebraska-born entertainer Dick Cavett
will participate in the third annual National Liars Hall of Fame
induction ceremony Oct. 28 in this central Nebraska community of
380 residents.
   Folklorist Roger Welsch, co-founder of the hall, said Thursday
that Cavett will produce a segment for his weekly ``Comedy Hour''
radio show while participating in the ceremony at Eric's Big Table
Tavern.
   Welsch said one person will be inducted into the Liar's Hall and
several will receive Pinocchio Awards for the best lies of the year.
   The first hall inductee was Roy Harpham of Harvard, who said:
``I once met an honest fisherman.''
   Last year, Robert Peterson Sr. of Dannebrog was inducted for
saying that one day in February it was so cold he saw a lawyer with
his hands in his own pockets.
   Welsch said politicians are not considered for awards because
``It is open only to amateurs.''

   Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve
Board chairman known for an ever-present cigar, says the nation
needs to raise taxes on some commodities _ including cigars _ to
cut the nation's deficit and promote exports.
   But now it turns out that Volcker, who left the Fed in August
1987, has quit smoking. He told a dinner audience here Thursday
that the government should move at least $30 billion annually into
deficit reductions by cutting spending and raising taxes.
   He suggested raising taxes gradually on gasoline, alcohol and
tobacco products, including cigars.
   ``I don't smoke them anymore,'' he said of cigars during the
fund-raising dinner in Indianapolis for the American Center for
International Leadership in Columbus, Indiana.
   Volcker said presidential candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis shouldn't trap themselves into promising not to raise taxes.
   ``I don't hear them saying much, but that's the good news. When
I hear them say something, I don't like it,'' he said.

   FBI agents and local authorities seized more
than $4.5 million worth of ``bootleg'' music cassette tapes and
counterfeiting equipment and arrested eight people during a series
of raids.
   The alleged piracy operation was earning $30,000 to $40,000 a
week producing music cassettes, said Lt. Roger Clark of the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
   The operation was producing an estimated 5,000 tapes a day of
pirated music by such popular recording artists as Bob Dylan,
Jackson Brown, Janet Jackson and the Bangles, officials said.
   The tapes, business records and equipment were confiscated
Thursday in raids in Los Angeles, Fontana, Ontario, Montclair,
Monrovia, Costa Mesa, Upland and Westminster.
   The alleged ringleader, identified as Najeh Badawi, 32, of
Fontana, and the other seven were arrested for investigation of
conspiracy to commit grand theft, Clark said.
   Badawi told a reporter who accompanied authorities on the raid
that he didn't know that duplicating copyrighted musical recordings
onto cassette tapes was against the law.
   ``It's not my business,'' Badawi said. ``I'm working for
someone. I was looking for something to do, something to feed my
family.''
   Clark identified the other suspects as Portino Delgado, 52, of
Mexico; Juan Espinosa, 28, of Mexico City; Juan Luis Perez, 21 of
Temuri, Mexico; Mohamed Abdallah, 57, of Pasadena; Olivia Moreno
Salcedo, 35, of La Puente; Salim Matsubsi, 28, of Westminster and
Adman Mohamad, 34, of Westminster.
   Steven D`Onofrio, chief of anti-piracy operations for the
Recording Industry Association of America, estimated that the
recording industry loses about $300 million a year to music
counterfeiting.

   A retired United Airlines pilot who sped
down the San Diego Freeway at 80 mph while his estranged wife clung
to the hood of his car was sentenced to six years in state prison.
   Russell A. Jobst, 44, who pleaded guilty last month to child
endangerment and two counts of asault with a deadly weapon, was
sentenced Thursday by Torrance Superior Court Judge William C.
Beverly Jr.
   Jobst drove off with his 19-month-old son on Aug. 17, 1987, as
his wife, Madonna Kennedy-Jobst, clung to the car's hood.
   Jobst said he was remorseful and wouldn't hurt Mrs.
Kennedy-Jobst in any way if he was spared a prison term.
   But the judge said the circumstances outweighed the defendant's
good behavior in jail, his solid record as a Navy helicopter pilot
and his apparent belief that he had received custody of the boy
during a divorce and custody dispute in a Hawaiian court.
   ``What can't be sympathized with is his response to this
situation,'' Beverly said. ``When he reacted the way that he did,
he endangered the life of his son, his estranged wife and everyone
around him.''
   Mrs. Kennedy-Jobst, 37, testifying at the sentencing, said this
incident was not the first in which her estranged husband was
violent.
   ``It is simply the most recent and the most public,'' she said.
``He has an inability to deal with anger.''
   Jobst could be eligible for parole after about two years and two
months in prison, a state Department of Corrections official said.

<HEAD>Reagan Warns Special Session Possible If Contras Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Friday he ``would not
hesitate'' to call Congress back in special session if the Contra
rebels are threatened, a statement apparently designed to keep the
rebels' hopes alive until a new president can take up their cause.
   Reagan's message to Capitol Hill had been anticipated for days,
following acknowledgments from both White House officials and GOP
lawmakers that prospects were nil for obtaining a $16.5 million
cache of weapons for the rebels in the waning days of the 100th
Congress.
   A special session is considered very unlikely.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration wanted to send the message that one of Reagan's most
passionate causes is not being abandoned in the final days of his
administration.
   Fitzwater said the purpose of the letter ``was to reassure those
who are concerned about the Contras.''
   ``The conclusion was that we didn't have the time _ we may not
have had the votes _ and there was not a crying need'' to seek the
military assistance at this time, he said.
   ``We want to reassure everyone that we stand behind the
resistance, as the president has often repeated. And we're prepared
to call Congress back if it's necessary,'' the spokesman added.
   Earlier in the week, Fitzwater had said administration officials
had come to the realization that ``we will just have to wait until
there is a new president and new Congress to see what happens next
on aid to maintain the resistance as a fighting force.''
   At present, the dwindling Contra forces are subsisting on $27
million in food, clothing and medical supplies approved by Congress
last month as part of a Pentagon money bill.
   They have received no weaponry from the United States since
February, when lethal aid was suspended in deference to efforts at
reaching a peace accord between the rebels and the leftist
Sandinista government.
   The mood in Congress remains strongly opposed to sending new
military aid. But under the defense appropriations measure, a
complicated process was established for Reagan to request the
release of the $16.5 million in weapons, if certain conditions were
met.
   But Congress would again have to approve the release, meaning
that a special session would be necessary if the request came after
Congres adjourns, which is expected next week.
   In his statement, Reagan warned the Nicaraguan government
against taking advantage of the fact that U.S. lawmakers were
leaving town soon and would be unable to send any aid until a new
Congress convenes in January.
   ``In the event the Sandinistas attempt to capitalize on this
situation, they should know I would not hesitate to call the 100th
Congress back into session to consider emergency assistance to the
freedom fighters,'' Reagan said.
   Fitzwater said the White House would prefer not to call a
special session, particularly since any other subject could be put
before the lawmakers.
   Asked about the threat on Wednesday, House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said:
   ``I hope the president doesn't try to grandstand and make a
political football out of Central America. ... It's a bit of show
biz to come around after we have gone home. Surely he won't do
that.''
   Reagan's statement also contained the expected pledge of
continued support for the Contra rebels.
   ``America must stand with those who fight for freedom in
Nicaragua,'' Reagan said. ``We have an obligation to share the
blessings of our liberty with those who yearn for freedom in
Nicaragua. Their struggle is our struggle _ and together we can
achieve democracy in Nicaragua.''
   Fitzwater denied that Reagan was abandoning the Contras, saying
the decision against pushing the military aid issue at this time is
``a long way from backing off from the Contras.''
   ``The president will stand with this until the end'' of his term
in January, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Bush Campaign Complains Of Sierra Club Criticism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's campaign has protested to the
Sierra Club that the club is unfairly criticizing one of his
actions in delaying a reduction in the lead content of gasoline
seven years ago, a club lobbyist said Friday.
   The lobbyist, Blake Early, said Bush aides said the regulation
in question went into effect ``after a period of review and we
shouldn't be hitting them up on it.'' He did not say who lodged the
complaint.
   Mark Goodin, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said he did not
have information immediately at hand on such a protest. Asked if
the campaign believed the criticism unfair, Goodin replied, ``We
sure do.''
   Bush as vice president headed an administration task force that
forced agencies to re-examine, and in some cases delay or cancel,
hundreds of regulations just after President Reagan took office in
1981.
   One of these was a planned reduction in the lead content of
gasoline. Fourteen months later, in July 1982, the Environmental
Protection Agency went ahead with a rule closely paralleling its
original plan.
   Lead is a deadly poison in high concentrations and can cause
brain damage in children. Used for decades in gasoline to boost
octane, it can disable exhaust pollution control equipment on
post-1975 cars. EPA said thousands of children probably were
suffering slight IQ reductions because of lead in their blood from
auto exhausts and other sources.
   Since then, the agency has ordered a further 90 percent
reduction in the lead content of gasoline, which Bush claimed
credit for in Thursday night's debate with Michael Dukakis.
   The reconsideration ordered by the Bush task force in 1981 was
prompted by complaints from small refiners that they would lose
money if they had to meet the new standards.
   Early said it was ``not clear that (the administration's
eventual) support was not the result of the large public outcry''
that followed news of EPA's decision to reconsider the lead
reduction program.
   Early spoke at a news conference where the club released a
report critical of another action of the task force that led EPA to
drop its requirement for double liners under 1,078 existing surface
impoundments of hazardous waste liquids, a requirement that
Congress wrote into the law in 1984 and which becomes effective
next month.

<HEAD>Chicago Artist Grows Clothing From Grass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Harding is a different kind of tailor,
crafting clothing that conveys a message about the environment _ a
message that grows because his fashions are made of grass growing
on fabric.
   Harding, an artist, began growing grass on clothing and other
objects about nine years ago. Now, he has decided to see if there's
a market for grass clothing.
   ``I'll be selling long grass-covered robes'' for $150, he says.
``And I'm putting together an $85 grass-growing kit, which'll
contain a one-size-fits-all robe, already seeded, a hanger, a
plastic bag, a plant mister and an instruction booklet.''
   Harding, 29, recently taught a class on growing grass clothing
at Express-Ways Children's Museum on the North Side and two weeks
later his students wore their green outfits in a parade around the
museum.
   ``Wearing one is a unique experience,'' he says. ``It's the only
instance _ besides being in the womb _ where you're enclosed in a
living thing. It's heavy and damp _ a robe may weigh 15 pounds. But
after wearing the suit for an hour, you feel relaxed and energized.
It retains your body heat and stays at body temperature, too.
   ``It's your own portable environment. If everyone took care of
their environment like people take care of their grass clothes,
we'd be on a path to survival.''
   Concern about the environment prompted Harding to plant his
first grass seeds on fabric, growing miniature lawns on a suit of
clothes, including shoes, tie and hat, for an art show.
   ``After it was grown, I put it on, then came onstage and had
someone chase me with a lawn mower. The idea was that our
environment is being pursued _ mowed down _ by technology,''
Harding says.
   He says his social and political statements with grass aren't
difficult or expensive to grow, and he buys the garments that
support the wearable lawns from thrift shops.
   ``Grass is especially good for my purposes since it doesn't take
as long as most plants to germinate if it's sufficiently watered,''
he says.
   ``I grew three grass suits, a robe and two jackets in my damp
basement for a wedding recently,'' he adds. ``I used 1{ gallons (of
water) a day for each suit and the robe, plus a gallon a day for
each jacket. It took 11 days. They came out pretty good.''

<HEAD>Miami News For Sale, Could Close At Year's End If Buyer Not Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miami News, an afternoon newspaper that has won
five Pulitzer prizes, will be closed by the end of the year if no
buyer can be found, parent company Cox Enterprises said Friday.
   ``The facts concerning the condition of The News are clear,''
said Miami News Publisher David Kraslow. ``We have given this
community our best as professionals. The News is a good newspaper
with a rich and proud tradition.
   ``It is damned painful to contemplate the likely demise of a
newspaper that has given this community so much for so long.''
   The staff of The News, which was founded in 1896, was informed
of the decision Friday morning.
   ``Everyone's in shock,'' said City Editor Paul Kaplan. ``We were
offered what was called a generous severance plan. I'm not
surprised this has happened. I guess when you look at it from the
outside, we're a dying newspaper.''
   Cox officials said The News was losing too much money.
   ``Quite simply, The Miami News, despite an outstanding editorial
presentation, is not supported by advertisers or readers,'' David
Easterly, president of the Cox newspaper division, said in a
statement released in Atlanta.
   ``Daily circulation has declined from 112,000 in 1966 to below
48,000 today, while Dade County households have grown by 80 percent
in the same period. This means that The Miami News now serves fewer
than 8 percent of Dade County households.''
   The Miami News has operated since 1966 under a joint operating
agreement with The Miami Herald, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Under the 30-year JOA, The Herald, a morning newspaper, is
responsible for providing advertising, circulation, production, and
promotion services to The News. Atlanta-based Cox owns the
newspaper and manages only the editorial department of The News.
   Cox Enterprises will profit on a non-existent newspaper under
the terms of an agreement negotiated more than a year ago with
Knight-Ridder Inc., Cox officials said.
   Under the new agreement, Knight-Ridder will pay Cox Enterprises
a percentage of The Herald's profits, based on a sliding scale,
through the year 2021, even if The News ceases publication.
   The profit percentage, which was 15 percent under the old
agreement, will decline to 10 percent over the next five years
under the new deal, and will remain at that level until 2021,
Easterly said.
   That means Cox could earn $165 million from The Herald, by
conservative estimates based on current figures, over the next 33
years, Easterly said.
   James C. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Cox,
made the announcement ``with a deep sense of sorrow and regret.''
   ``The Miami News ... has a long and proud history as an
outstanding, crusading newspaper. It has been home and continues to
be home to a number of distinguished reporters and editors, and a
vital voice in Miami's history,'' Kennedy said.
   One of its staff is editorial cartoonist Don Wright, two-time
Pulitzer Prize winner, whose work is syndicated in newspapers
across the country.
   The News won three other Pulitzers: the first in 1939, for a
series of stories about three Miami city commissioners promoting
pet projects at City Hall; in 1959; for reporter Howard Van Smith's
series on the plight of South Florida's migrant workers; and in
1962, for reporter Hal Hendrix's coverage of the Cuban missile
crisis.
   Easterly said that since 1966, Knight-Ridder and Cox have lost
more than $90 million in operating The News. He said the net cost
of publishing The Miami News is running about $9 million a year and
would be expected to worsen over time.
   The first edition of The Miami Metropolis _ the original name of
The Miami News _ was printed on cream-colored paper on May 15,
1896, just a few months before the pioneer development now known as
Miami was incorporated.
   On April 18, 1923, the paper was bought by publisher James M.
Cox, the ex-governor of Ohio and an unsuccessful presidential
candidate in 1920.

<TEXT>
   Fed up with dangerous search and rescue
missions for reckless hikers in New Hampshire's White Mountains,
the state has brought its first criminal charge against a hiker who
had to be rescued after getting drunk on a mountaintop.
   Jeffrey Morgan, 30, of Atlanta, was charged Thursday with
reckless conduct after rescuers were rousted in the middle of the
night to help him off snowy Mount Moriah outside Gorham. He pleaded
guilty in Gorham District Court and was fined $500, half of which
was suspended.
   ``The executive director, Donald Normandeau, made the decision
to `get tough with this business _ it's gone too far,' so we
charged him,'' Maj. Henry Mock, head of Fish and Game Department
law enforcement, said Friday.
   ``We did it to make a statement, and the statement is that we
are no longer going to tolerate this kind of activity on the part
of the hikers,'' Mock said. ``Whenever we see something that is
this flagrant, we will be considering these charges.''
   Morgan, Mock said, had been hiking the Appalachian Trail for six
months and three days. He hiked from Georgia to Maryland, then took
a bus to Maine, where he turned around and began hiking south,
authorities said.
   ``When he hit the North Country, he did not like cold weather,
so he went into Gorham, bought himself a fifth of vodka and decided
that would help him finish the trail,'' Mock said.
   He said Morgan was found ``violently ill'' at the top of Mount
Moriah at 8 p.m. Wednesday by two hikers from Massachusetts, one of
whom was a doctor.
   ``The doctor could see that he was also extremely hypothermic
and was not going to make it unless something was done for him,''
Mock said.
   He said the two pulled Morgan from the summit to some shelter,
put him in his sleeping bag and wrapped him in a space blanket
before heading down the mountain for help.
   At 2 a.m., they reached a farmhouse and called authorities.
   A fish and game officer and volunteer headed up the mountain at
3 a.m., and reached Morgan at about daylight, Mock said. Meanwhile,
a sizeable crew was mobilized to help carry Morgan down, based on
the report from the doctor.
   When the two rescuers reached Morgan, he had gotten out of the
sleeping bag and was stumbling down a trail, with no memory of how
he had gotten where he was, Mock said.
   The reckless conduct charge, a misdemeanor, can be applied in
cases in which a person knows his actions will place the lives or
safety of others in jeopardy, Mock said. It specifically mentions
alcohol use.
   Mock said other recent rescues also could have been considered
for charges and that more will be brought in the future.
   ``We have to make that fine-line difference between
foolhardiness, stupidity, lack of good judgment and recklessness,
and that's not always easy to do,'' he said. ``In this case, it
was.''

<HEAD>Meat Industry Backs New Program To Track Pork Across State Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the nation's meat industry on
Friday pledged support of a new Agriculture Department rule that
will require identification and recordkeeping on all swine sold
across state lines.
   The new regulation will go into effect on Nov. 14 as a
long-sought method of tracing the source of diseased hogs or those
with harmful drug or chemical residues.
   ``We intend to cooperate very closely with the department to
work out all the technicalities of this program so that it will be
as effective and efficient as possible,'' said Manly Molpus,
president of the American Meat Institute. ``We are delighted USDA
has made this a mandatory requirement.''
   His comments followed USDA's final rulemaking procedure that
will put the new regulation into force within 30 days. The proposed
rule was announced last Feb. 3.
   The regulation will require each hog to be identified
individually, which can include eartags, tatoos and backtags.
Record on each animal must be kept for two years and must include
the serial number of other approved identification appearing on the
swine.
   ``Every person who handles swine is responsible for the
identification as soon as it moves into interstate commerce,'' said
Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles. ``If the identification is
already on the hog, the next person in the chain is only required
to make and keep a record of it.''
   Pressure for swine identification came from Congress and the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.
Besides the American Meat Institute, support also came from a
number of other trade and professional associations such as the
Livestock Conservation Institute and the National Pork Producers
Council.

   A driver who caused a crash that killed
three members of a wedding party last year was sentenced to prison
Friday, and the judge complained that he could not make the
sentence longer than seven years.
   In setting the sentence of two and one-third to seven years, the
maximum permitted by law, Judge Richard Delin said defendant
Vincent Laezza had made his automobile ``a lethal weapon ... in a
blatant disregard for human life.''
   Laezza, 21, was convicted of three counts of criminally
negligent homicide and one count of assault in a jury trial last
month, but acquitted on the more serious counts of manslaughter.
   Delin said he found it ludicrous that he could give the
defendant no more than up to seven years for the deaths of three
people.
   ``He used a public highway of our county as a racetrack,'' Delin
said, noting that witnesses said Laezza was drag racing at speeds
of up to 100 mph at the time of the collision. He said Laezza had
shown no remorse.
   ``I feel terrible for what happened,'' a sobbing Laezza said in
pleading for leniency. Speaking in a barely audible voice, he
added, ``It is something I have to live with for the rest of my
life.''
   Police said Laezza was speeding down Lido Boulevard when his car
smacked into a stretch limousine carrying the wedding party on
April 3, 1987.
   Killed instantly was the groom, Peter Phillips, 27, of North
Massapequa, and his brother and best man, John, 29, of Islip. The
bride, Carol Zagorski Phillips, 24, died of her injuries 18 days
later without ever knowing of her new husband's death.
   The bride's sister and maid of honor, Debra Zagorski, was
seriously injured.

   Two American Indians charged in the takeover
of a newspaper to protest alleged corruption and the treatment of
minorities in their rural county were found innocent Friday of all
charges against them.
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, was acquitted of federal hostage-taking and
weapons charges in connection with Feb. 1 incident, in which up to
20 people were held hostage for 10 hours at The Robesonian
newspaper in Lumberton, in southeastern North Carolina. No one was
hurt in the takeover.
   Timothy Jacobs, 20, was acquitted of weapons charges. U.S.
District Judge Terrence Boyle had dismissed the hostage-taking
count against him earlier this week.
   ``The jury has made what is going to be a historic verdict, a
verdict that people will remember,'' Hatcher said as he left the
courthouse for the first time in two weeks without wearing
shackles. ``I don't think people realize yet how important this
verdict is.''
   ``I'm just glad that Timothy and Eddie did something to draw
attention to the conditions in our county,'' said Eleanor Jacobs,
Jacobs' mother. ``I hate they used guns. But they did draw
attention to something that was needed. The jury had compassion.
They understood things.''
   Robesonian Editor Bob Horne, who was one of the hostages, said
he had no immediate comment on the verdict.
   The jury deliberated for less than a day before acquitting the
two Tuscarora Indians of making and possessing illegal firearms,
conspiring to make those weapons and conveying false information
about explosives. Hatcher also was acquitted of hostage-taking.
   In his closing statement Thursday, Hatcher argued that his life
and that of Jacobs were in jeopardy because of information they had
linking law enforcement officers to drug trafficking in the county.
   ``(Assistant U.S. Attorney John) Bruce talked about the
Constitution this morning and how it allows peaceful protest,'' he
said.
   ``When those sworn to uphold the Constitution won't, what do you
do?'' he asked in a closing statement partially written by his
attorney, William Kunstler.
   Kunstler could not appear at the trial because he was handling a
case in New York.
   Bruce argued that even if the defense's allegations of
corruption among officials in Robeson County were true, their
actions at The Robesonian were not justified.
   ``If everything in this whole scenario they have spun out is
true, it still does not justify their putting innocent people in
terror of their lives,'' Bruce said.
   ``What can start out as just a kernel can get some people
agitated, upset and carried away into doing something criminal,''
he said. ``And maybe they just become a little too convinced of
their own importance. I suggest to you that's what happened here.''
   Bruce also argued that allegations of racial injustice were
irrelevant to the case.
   Boyle ruled that defense attorneys could not argue that the
hostage-taking was justified because Hatcher and Jacobs feared for
their lives and believed they had no alternative. Instead, defense
attorneys argued that Hatcher and Jacobs did not have criminal
intentions in the takeover.
   Defense lawyer Lewis Pitts said taking hostages was ``a drastic
action'' he was not trying to minimize but that the intentions of
Hatcher and Jacobs were critical to the case.
   ``If you put aside the fear and impact on the individuals (at
the newspaper), what it comes down to is if they had a guilty mind
or evil intent,'' he said.

   The Marine Corps has returned to operation its
fleet of CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters after a one-time
inspection prompted by the discovery of a defective nut, officials
said Friday.
   The heavy-lift transport copters, almost all of which are based
inside the United States, were temporarily grounded ast Sunday
after mechanics at a training squadron at the Tustin, Calif.,
Marine Corps Air Station found a scratch on a main transmission
gearbox nut.
   The 1{-inch nut, subsequently judged to be defective, was one of
12 used to secure the main transmission inside the CH-53E, allowing
it to deliver power from the engines to the copter's rotor blade.
   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a Marine spokesman in Washington, said all
93 of the Super Stallions were returned to service after the
emergency inspections failed to turn up any other defective nuts.
   The Naval Air Systems Command has concluded, however, that some
of the ``transmission barrel nut assemblies'' purchased by the
Defense Logistics Agency for the Super Stallions are defective and
they are being removed from the inventory, Peck added.
   William Armstrong, a spokesman for the Naval Air Systems
Command, declined immediate comment on the matter or to say what
company had manufactured the nut assemblies.
   The temporary grounding was the third for the Super Stallions in
the past two years prompted by a transmission problem.
   The fleet was grounded in February 1987 because of a defective
gear that forced an emergency landing. The following July, another
grounding was ordered because of three bearing failures, one of
which resulted in an emergency landing.
   In a related development, local officials at the Tustin base
said Thursday that a Super Stallion had been damaged on Sept. 27
when one of its three engines caught fire while taxiing. Base
firefighters extinguished the flames and none of the four Marines
on board was injured.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Moving Away From Collective Farming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has signaled that
the new hope for producing more food is in the hands of farmers,
not the collective system built with the blood of millions of
Soviets.
   In a major speech published Friday on the front pages of Soviet
newspapers, Gorbachev didn't say outright that collectivization was
a mistake and should be scrapped.
   But his stress was no longer on the collectively run farms or on
those owned and operated by the state. They have been the backbone
of Soviet agriculture since Josef Stalin's bloody drive in the late
1920s to collectivize farms by forcing individual farmers into
state-owned and run enterprises.
   Gorbachev wants a system in which families or small groups can
lease land, choose their own crops and keep most of the profits.
There have been experiments along these lines, and he made clear he
wanted the nation's whole agrarian sector to move along that path.
   He did not mention Stalin in his speech, which was delivered
Wednesday to farmers and Communist Party officials, but praised
Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin for recognizing the value of
peasants and giving them more control over the land under the New
Economic Policy in the early 1920s.
   Without blaming collectivization by name, Gorbachev said the
agricultural system had ``torn the man from the land, from the
means of production.'' He said people were driven away from farms
and into the city in search of more consumer goods and better
housing.
   Gorbachev, the son of a southern Russian peasant and the
Communist Party's top agriculture official before being named
general secretary in 1985, made clear, however, that there are no
plans to do away with state-run farms.
   ``Through the lease contract we must open up the potential of
kolkhozes and sovkhozes,'' he said.
   ``A person's desire to own land and resources, to create his own
family farm, does not contradict socialism, comrades. Such an owner
will work on land which is public property,'' he said.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
speech showed that in agricultural policy, ``ideological restraints
are giving way to pragmatism.''
   On the political level, the diplomat said, Gorbachev is showing
his finesse at calming conservatives who think his reforms are
going too far. In essence, he is ``moving away from
collectivization without saying he is doing this,'' said the
diplomat.
   Gorbachev's implicit criticism of collectivization has become
more obvious in his recent speeches. A year ago, he acknowledged
that ``excesses'' marred the transition from private farming to
collectivization of agriculture. But, he added, it was ``in the
final analysis a transformation of great importance.''
   In March, he said the possibilities of cooperative farms were a
``brilliant discovery'' of Lenin that had been underused and even
despised by subsequent rulers.
   Gorbachev, increasingly impatient with the pace of reform, made
clear that he wants improvements _ and wants them by the spring
harvest.
   The speech appeared designed to address the increasingly open
anger of citizens who complain that perestroika _ the plan to
restructure Soviet society _ has had little effect on the quality
of their lives.
   The uproar swelled up around the 57-year-old Soviet leader
himself last month in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, when
residents surrounded him and shouted that there was no meat in the
stores and that fruit and vegetables were scarce.
   Gorbachev said in his speech that the agricultural reforms,
using new forms of management and new technology, are designed to
reduce losses from poor processing, storage and transportation, and
to improve incentives for farmers to produce more and better crops
and livestock. Solving the ``infrastructure'' problems alone could
add 25 percent to 40 percent to the amount of food that reaches
people's tables, Gorbachev said.
   So far, he admitted, the billions of rubles the state has been
pouring into state and collective farms have not solved chronic
food shortages.
   Wednesday's meeting raised eyebrows not only for its talk of
radical changes in Soviet agriculture, but also by the absence of
some key officials.
   Among those who would have been expected to attend but didn't
were Yegor Ligachev, who was put in charge of a new party
commission on agriculture Sept. 30, and the head of the state
agency overseeing agriculture, Vsevolod Murakhovsky.
   No official explanation was given for Murakhovsky's absence, but
government spokesmen said Ligachev, Gorbachev's main conservative
rival, was on vacation.
   The Western diplomat said it was too early to tell whether
Ligachev's absence meant his input into agricultural reform would
be minimal and that he was losing power at Gorbachev's expense in
general.

   U.S. and Soviet officials Friday ended two days of
negotiations without a new long-term grain agreement, the U.S.
Embassy said.
   Negotiators also set no date for the next round of talks, the
embassy said.
   Both delegations put forward new proposals and were taking them
to their governments for consideration, with the United States
continuing to press for a five-year deal, an embassy statement said.
   The U.S. negotiating team left for the United States, it said.
   The Soviet Union on Wednesday proposed extending the previous
deal for just one year, catching the Reagan administration by
surprise, the Financial Times said.
   The newspaper quoted Soviet negotiator Yuri Chumakov as saying
the Soviets preferred to reach a short-term agreement now, leaving
room for further negotiation in the future.
   The most recent five-year agreement expired Sept. 30, although
the Soviet Union since has made some large purchases of U.S.
grains, including 275,000 tons announced Oct. 11. That brought the
total sold for Soviet delivery in the 1988-89 corn marketing year
to more than 4.7 million tons.

   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said Thailand would be offered 20 of the 155mm howitzers, 20

   ``This purchase is part of a Thai program to restructure and

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle predicted Friday that he will now become a ``background
issue'' in the campaign and he said Democrat Michael Dukakis is the
real political liability.
   Quayle, who polls have suggested has been a drag on George
Bush's Republican campaign, commented during his first news
conference since Sept. 15.
   He criticized Dukakis for failing to say anything nice about
Bush after each candidate was asked during the debate to praise the
other.
   ``George Bush was very complimentary to Michael Dukakis on a
personal basis,'' Quayle said. Dukakis, he said, ``did lack the
common courtesy to say something nice.''
   Quayle held the news conference in Fort Smith, Ark., before
touring an electric plant and traveling to Louisiana for a rally
and fund-raiser. He then flew to Albuquerque, N.M.
   At a rousing rally at the University of Southwestern Louisiana,
Quayle released a list of what he called Dukakis debate
``failures.''
   He said Dukakis dodged the issue of taxes, failing to commit
himself to opposing tax increases. He also faulted Dukakis for his
``short-sighted and obstinate opposition to the death penalty'' and
for a ``shocking lack of knowledge'' on defense issues. He said
Dukakis would appoint liberals to the Supreme Court.
   In a series of interviews with Fort Smith media, Quayle was
asked about polls indicating substantial percentages of likely
voters view him negatively. Dukakis' negative ratings in recent
polls have rivaled or surpassed Quayle's.
   ``Governor Dukakis' negatives have gone up ... and ours have
actually switched to the better,'' Quayle said. He called Dukakis a
``drag on his ticket'' and added: ``The political liability happens
to be Governor Dukakis.''
   Quayle predicted a race that would go ``right down to the
wire.'' But he said he would become less of an issue.
   ``Obviously, there's going to be continued interest in me and
the reason for that is there's been so much interest in me up to
now,'' Quayle said. ``But it will be very much of a background
issue because the American people are trying to make up their minds
on the top of the ticket.''
   Quayle's news conference included no major stumbles. During his
last one, a month earlier, he called the Holocaust an ``obscene
period in our nation's history'' and then added, ``I didn't live in
this century.''
   He was asked Friday whether he would like to take another shot
at giving his opinion of the Holocaust, the killing of millions of
Jews under Adolf Hitler.
   ``I don't think it's necessary to get in and have a history
lesson on the Holocaust,'' he said. ``But let me say this ... if we
make the right decisions and we stay committed to peace and human
rights and if we can work with our allies and if we have good
intelligence, hopefully we can avert anything like the Holocaust.''
   ``Hopefully we have a learned a lesson about a very tragic event
in world history. ... Hopefully we will not repeat or allow things
that were truly tragic to happen again.''

   Students shouting ``Drive out
Yankees!'' attacked a U.S. government office, firebombed a police
bus and injured 13 officers Friday, police and U.S. officials said.
   Two police were seriously hurt in the battle in the southern
city of Kwangju, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. Police said
four protesters were arrested.
   About 100 protesters, many with iron pipes and clubs, hurled
rocks and about 150 gasoline bombs at the U.S. Information Service
building, the statement said.
   Some bombs hit a police bus by the gate with about 30 people
aboard, said The Chosun Ilbo, a leading newspaper in Seoul.
   No one was injured in the building, but a car inside the
compound was destroyed by firebombs and another was slightly
damaged, the embassy said. About 10 windows at the center's library
were damaged, it said.
   U.S. Embassy officials said seven assailants scaled the center's
roof from nearby inns while police outside fought back protesters
for about 10 minutes.
   ``From there, they hurled Molotov cocktails, steel pipes and
tiles which they ripped from the center roof,'' the officials said.
   The students on the roof carried a placard that read ``Repeal
armistice agreement, conclude peace treaty,'' said Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency. The 1950-53 war between North Korea and
South Korea ended with an armistice, and both sides are technically
still at war.
   Yonhap said the students denounced the United States and
demanded the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan, who has been
under parliamentary investigation for alleged corruption and
brutality during his seven-year rule. Chun left office in February.
   The students also hurled firebombs at a downtown police station,
shatterring windows, Chosun said.
   The U.S. Information Service building has been the target of
frequent attacks by radical students demanding the withdrawal of
U.S. forces in South Korea under a mutual defense pact. Radicals
contend the United States has enforced division of the Korean
peninsula.
   On Thursday, hundreds of students firebombed a government party
building and protested in downtown Kwangju when police blocked them
from approaching the U.S. center.
   Dissidents and radical students stepped up an anti-U.S. campaign
after the Olympics. Government officials are concerned about
growing anti-U.S. sentiment fueled partly by trade conflict.
   About 300 students Friday battled riot police at Hankook
University of Foreign Studies in Seoul after burning effigies of
President Reagan and President Roh Tae-woo.
   Radicals contend the Roh regime is a front for a military
dictatorship supported by the United States, despite substantial
reforms being carried out by Roh.
   The students threw dozens of firebombs and rocks at riot police,
who responded with tear gas. Several students were bleeding, but it
was not known how many people were injured or arrested.

   Here is a sampling of what people and media around the world are
saying about the U.S. presidential election:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The daily Le Monde said that after Thursday night's presidential
debate, Vice President George Bush retained his lead over Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   ``Already favored in presidential polls, George Bush seems to
have had success in passing the last, perilous obstacle on the road
to the White House. In the second and last televised duel of the
campaign ... he managed, at least, to deprive his adversary ... of
the victory that he (Dukakis) badly needed.''
   The front-page article added that Dukakis failed to defeat Bush
or to ``improve his image to one of a man open and inspired.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUNGARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Budapest evening journal Esti Hirlap said Friday that the
debate pushed Bush toward victory.
   ``Bush argued in an amiably lighthearted manner, and his
down-to-earth approach to the subjects is likely to have driven
home his points among the voters _ one-third of whom are yet to
make up their minds which way to vote.
   ``Michael Dukakis, noted for his seriousness, made no small
efforts to look winsome at this last face-to-face occasion, but his
very concrete definitions of the nation's cares and worries, and
the need for unpopular measures that he deemed unavoidable, may
have acted the opposite way in the bid to win voters.
   ``As to the arms issue, Dukakis endorsed faster development of
conventional weapons while Bush _ accusing him wrongly of backing
unilateral disarmament _ stressed the Reagan administration's
achievements in promoting world peace while upholding the `peace
from strength' principle.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NORWAY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The independent daily Verdens Gang said Friday that Dukakis had
his last chance in the debate _ and misused it.
   ``Despite doing one of his best TV appearances ever, he never
managed to run over George Bush,'' it said. ``Dukakis entered his
final 90-minute TV round knowing that this final debate was his
biggest chance to pick up the 14 percent he was behind in public
opinion polls. But regardless how earnest and sincere he was, his
opponent George Bush was too good for him to succeed.''

   British bookmakers shortened the odds Friday on a Bush victory.
   Ladbrokes gave odds of 1-6 on Bush, meaning that if he wins, a
bet of six dollars wins $1 plus the original stake. It gave 3-1
odds on Dukakis, meaning a bet of $1 would win $3 plus the stake.
   Before Thursday's debate, Ladbrokes gave Bush 1-3 odds and
Dukakis 7-4.
   William Hill gave Bush 2-9, from 4-7 on Thursday; and Dukakis
11-4, from 5-4.
   ``We've lost count of the bets of three figures we've taken
today for George Bush,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.
``And we've just been contacted by a punter in Manchester who said
he wanted to put 20,000 pounds ($35,000) on Mr. Bush.''

   Anti-government radicals bombed a
railway station in central Sri Lanka on Friday and assassinated two
members of the governing party in separate incidents, officials
said.
   No one was reported injured in the bombing at the Kadugannawa
Railway Station, but state-run radio said the blast prompted the
government to extend a curfew in the region.
   The station is about 50 miles northeast of the capital, Colombo.
There was no claim of responsibility, but police blamed the
extremist Sinhalese People's Liberation Front, which opposes a
government plan aimed at making peace with minority Tamils.
   A senior police official said Sinhalese extremists arrived at
the station at 3 a.m., chased out all employees and then set off
the bomb.
   The blast destroyed part of the station and damaged some rail
tracks, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Rail service was suspended indefinitely, he said.
   After the explosion, the government extended a curfew in Kandy
district and southern Matara district until 6 a.m. Saturday,
state-run radio reported.
   The curfew was imposed in Matara on Monday after anti-government
demonstrators clashed with security forces. At least 15 people were
killed.
   On Tuesday, it was extended to the Kandy region after police
opened fire to quell a student demonstration. One student was
killed and three were injured.
   A government statement issued in Colombo said Piyadasa Witharana
and H.A. Podiappuhamy, both provincial council members of the
governing United National Party, were murdered by members of the
the People's Liberation Front.
   Witharana was killed Thursday in the southern Matara district
while Podiappuhamy was assassinated the same day in the central
Badulla district, the statement said. Both areas are dominated by
Sinhalese.
   The People's Liberation Front opposes a peace accord aimed at
ending a 5-year-old war by Tamil rebels demanding a separate nation.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They claim they are oppressed by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population.
   The leaders of Sri Lanka and India signed the accord in 1987.
India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbor, has a large Tamil population
of its own and mediated the agreement.
   Sinhalese extremists say the accord makes too many concessions
to Tamils, and they have vowed to kill anyone who supports it.

   Protesters hurling bottles and rocks clashed
with Israeli troops across the occupied territories Friday, the
army said. Arab sources and Israel radio said one Palestinian was
killed and five wounded.
   Soldiers demolished five homes and sealed another belonging to
Palestinians suspected of assassinating an alleged Israeli
collaborator last week, the army command said.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's mainstream Fatah group
claimed responsibility for killing three alleged collaborators in
the West Bank city of Nablus and warned that others cooperating
with Israel would be killed.
   Palestinians stayed away from their jobs and closed their shops
in accordance with a strike order from underground pro-PLO and
Islamic leaders. West Bank cities resembled ghost towns.
   Protesters splashed oil on city streets to prevent people from
driving their cars. Residents of the Dheisha refugee camp, near
Bethlehem, stoned vehicles along the Jerusalem-Hebron highway.
   Soldiers fanned out in several Palestinian villages to arrest
alleged Arab protest leaders. The move was in keeping with the
army's policy of taking the initiative on strike days to forestall
violence.
   In one such operation, troops opened fire on Palestinian
demonstrators in Kfar Malik, killing one and wounding another, Arab
reporters said. The army said two protesters were wounded in the
clash.
   The fatality brought to 297 the number of Palestinians killed
since Dec. 8, when the uprising against occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip began. Six Israelis have died.
   In a battle in the narrow, winding streets of the casbah in
Nablus, troops shot and wounded three Palestinians after they were
attacked by dozens of masked protesters, the army command said.
   Two Palestinians were shot by Israeli troops in demonstrations
in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed
one of the casualties.
   In Jerusalem, two policemen were lightly injured in a brawl with
Palestinian demonstrators in the neighborhood of Issawiyeh, Israel
radio reported. Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.
   In Bethlehem, insurgents defied Israeli law by flying
Palestinian flags. They scrawled graffiti on walls saying, ``We
will die but not kneel to the occupation.''
   In the West Bank village of Bidiya, soldiers demolished five
houses and sealed another, the army said. The houses belonged to
Palestinians suspected of killing the traditional village leader
Mustafa Salim Abu Bakr, an alleged collaborator with Israel.
   A military spokesman said Abu Bakr's killers shot him and then
set fire to his car while he was in it.
   The army lifted a week-old curfew in Nablus and distributed
leaflets explaining that the 120,000 inhabitants had been confined
to their homes after Palestinians killed three suspected Arab
collaborators.
   On Wednesday, the army announced it captured the alleged killers.
   The PLO's mainstream Fatah group has claimed responsibility for
the killing of the three collaborators, saying they had helped
Israeli authorities arrest hundreds of Palestinians.
   ``We promise you more such punishments whenever and wherever we
get the chance,'' the leaflet said.

   George Bush says he did not vote to cut Social
Security cost-of-living adjustments, and Michael Dukakis says he
went on record at the National Governors Association against cuts
in Social Security.
   But both candidates shaded the truth in their final debate
Thursday night in Los Angeles.
   ``Let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut
COLAs,'' Bush said. ``And I voted the same way that he did three
months before in a national governors' conference.''
   But Bush did cast a tie-breaking Senate vote on May 9, 1985, for
a Senate budget freeze that included a one-year delay in a Social
Security cost-of-living increase.
   Dukakis, for his part, described a losing battle at the National
Governors Association to exempt Social Security from a federal
budget freeze that the governors _ including Dukakis _ eventually
endorsed.
   The Democrat never quite acknowledged that he voted for the
final resolution in February 1985 backing a one-year freeze
including Social Security payments. ``Everybody knew that those of
us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so ...
emphatically,'' he said.
   Bush's tie-breaking vote allowed Senate Republicans to pass,
50-49, a one-year budget freeze that included Social Security
COLAs. But President Reagan later withdrew his support and the
freeze never took place.
   At the governors' meeting, Dukakis was in a 26-17 majority who
voted to exempt Social Security from their recommendation of a
federal budget freeze. But they lacked the two-thirds majority
needed to amend the freeze resolution the governors eventually
approved.
   Bush promised, ``I will not go in there and suggest changes in
Social Security. I learned that the hard way.''
   Dukakis charged, ``You did it in 1985. The administration tried
to do it repeatedly ... in '81, '82 and I'm sure you'll try to do
it again.'' He said Bush had no way to pay for new weapons and a
cut in capital gains taxes ``unless you raid the Social Security
trust fund.''

   President Reagan borrowed a phrase from Vice
President George Bush on Friday to hail the five Discovery shuttle
astronauts as ``America's heroes.''
   Giving the men a hearty White House welcome, the president
appeared with the astronauts at an affectionate Rose Garden
ceremony as many NASA employees and some of their family members
looked on.
   ``Thank you for taking us into space ... and welcome home,''
Reagan said, evoking a round of applause from the crowd of several
hundred observers.
   The president told the five-member crew that he agreed with a
statement made by the vice president during his debate Thursday
evening with Democratic rival Micheal Dukakis.
   ``The vice president was right last night _ you are America's
heroes. You are his heroes and mine ... what you have done for the
program and the country will be long remembered,'' Reagan said.
``You ... and the entire team that made the mission of the
Discovery a success, deserve the praise of a grateful nation.''
   Although Reagan mentioned that the space program had had
``setbacks,'' he did not specifically mention the tragic fate of
the shuttle Challenger.
   The Discovery flight, which began on Sept. 29, was the first
shuttle mission since the Challenger blew up on liftoff, killing
all seven aboard.
   Reagan asserted that the Discovery mission symbolized a return
to space for the country and ``America intends to stay there.''
   ``We just want to say thanks again for this mission and for all
that it has meant to this country,'' Reagan said.
   The president also saluted the astronauts' wives, telling them
they were ``just as brave as these gentlemen.''
   The shuttle's commander, Frederick H. Hauck, presented the
president with a blue astronaut's jacket, complete with patches
from the mission that had been taken into space aboard the shuttle.
   Reagan beamed as he held the shiny, royal blue jacket aloft.
   In contrast, the five astronauts appeared a bit out of their
element, dressed in business suits and ties.
   The crew had met with Reagan at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston late last month, just days before their space mission
began. At that time, the astronauts had pledged to bring the jacket
and its patches back to the president at the White House.
   ``This is a great team that we work with,'' Hauck told the
president, adding, ``The team is only as good as its leader, and as
far as we're concerned, you're the captain of the team.''
   Hauck and his crew, pilot Richard O. Covey and mission
specialists John M. Lounge, David C. Hilmers and George D. Nelson,
were completing a two-day capital tour. On Thursday, they visited
the House gallery, where they were met by the applause of members
on the floor.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday signed into law a
bill aimed at spurring the manufacture of vehicles that can run on
fuels other than gasoline.
   ``This bill is a landmark in the quest for alternative forms of
energy,'' Reagan said. The legislation has been billed by its
supporters as providing a means of lowering U.S. dependence on
foreign oil, cutting pollution and curbing the trade deficit.
   ``The forms of energy encouraged by this bill are already in
use,'' the president said. ``Methanol, for example, is used in the
Indianapolis 500 and in other race cars because it simultaneously
enhances performance and safety.''
   ``And cars that run on methanol have the potential to reduce
emissions by an amazing 50 percent and improve efficiency,'' Reagan
added.
   The aim is to switch motorists from gasoline to methanol,
ethanol and natural gas by creating incentives for manufacturers to
develop vehicles to run on these substances, either alone or in at
least a 50-50 blend with gasoline.
   Each alternative-fuel car produced and sold would earn a
manufacturer large credits that would make it easier for the
company to meet the government's minimum fuel economy requirements
for its entire fleet.
   A further incentive would be authorization for the Department of
Energy to begin spending $18 million in October 1989 to buy and
test alternative fuel cars, trucks and buses.
   Advocates of the fuel switch-over say the United States has
abundant supplies of natural gas, the coal used to produce methanol
and the grain that is distilled and blended into gasoline to
produce ethanol.
   In the Roosevelt Room signing ceremony at the White House,
Reagan said ``this legislation also opens up new markets for
natural gas and coal, our two most plentiful energy resources in
this country.''
   He also said it ``takes advantage of existing government
programs and mechanisms to assist alternative fuels'' and that
``it's not intended to create massive new bureaucracies or new
taxpayer subsidies.''
   ``I believe we will look back on this as the single most
important act of the 100th Congress,'' Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.,
said when lawmakers concluded action on the bill.

   A rural Iowa sheriff says a newspaper clipping
led to the arrest of a Baltimore man wanted since Aug. 10 in
connection with the murder of his former girlfriend.
   Authorities said Andrew McCollough, 24, was given away by a
newspaper clipping in his wallet that detailed the killing. He was
in custody Friday in Greenfield, Iowa, facing extradition to
Maryland on murder charges in the shooting death of Andrea Fuller,
23.
   McCollough used a phony identification when Iowa authorities
arrested him Monday on a California car theft charge, Adair County
Sheriff Fred Skellenger said.
   ``If he had not had that newspaper clipping in his billfold,''
Skellenger said, ``I don't think it would have ever dawned on us''
to question his identity. ``We would have dropped the charges and
he'd be out.''
   McCollough was using the name Frankie Smith when he and two
passengers were stopped for a broken headlamp about 60 miles
southwest of Des Moines, Skellenger said.
   A registration check revealed that the car had been stolen in
Los Angeles three days earlier. Smith, a 30-year-old man and a
23-year-old woman from Los Angeles were arrested and charged with
auto theft.
   During booking in Greenfield, Skellenger said, ``I noticed in
Frankie Smith's billfold a newspaper item'' from The Evening Sun of
Baltimore.
   The eight-paragraph article said Baltimore police had obtained a
warrant for the arrest of Andrew McCollough for Ms. Fuller's
murder. She was described as McCollough's former girlfriend.
   Skellenger said he asked Smith why he was carrying the clipping.
   ``He said it was his family,'' Skellenger said.
   Elsewhere in the billfold, Skellenger found a birth certificate
for Frankie Smith issued by the Baltimore City Health Department on
Aug. 11, the day after the murder.
   Authorities in California declined to seek extradition of the
passengers on car theft charges, and they were released, Skellenger
said.

   A lawyer who held a U.S. consular agent
and his secretary at gunpoint for 14 hours released them unharmed
Friday and surrendered to authorities.
   Authorities said the gunman, identified as Francisco Delfin
Perez of Cordova, Veracruz, was arrested and taken to the state
capital of Jalapa to face kidnapping charges.
   Officials said Delfin Perez, about 48, walked into Edwin Culp's
office Thursday and took Culp and his secretary, Teresa Jesus
Horts, hostage.
   He was demanding that two brothers, a sister-in-law and a notary
public be imprisoned for allegedly cheating his mother in a dispute
over her late husband's estate, said Alfredo Algarin Vega,
assistant secretary of the Veracruz state government.
   It was unknown if the consulate office had a connection to the
inheritance dispute.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bob Hugins said Delfin Perez surrendered
and ``agreed to talk about his problems with Mexican government
officials.'' Hugins said Culp and Horts were freed shortly after 3
a.m.
   Culp's doctor said Culp was resting at home after the ordeal and
could not speak to reporters.
   Negotiations lasted through the night and included Algarin,
Delfin Perez' mother, and a friend of the lawyer. About 50 police
surrounded the downtown office building where the consulate office
is located.
   Algarin said Delfin Perez knew Culp. Officials understood from
the gunman's mother that the relationship was cordial, he said.
   Culp, 46, is from Missouri and has lived in Mexico for at least
15 years, Hugins said. While he is not a foreign service officer,
he has run the consular agency for at least six years, is
accredited to the Mexican government, and has diplomatic status,
Hugins said.
   William Graves, the chief U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Culp has
a restaurant, discotheque and clothing factory in this port city,
140 miles east of Mexico City.

   Two Israeli gunboats backed by a helicopter
gunship sank three rubber dinghies carrying Palestinian guerrillas
who apparently were trying to reach Israel from south Lebanon,
police said Friday.
   At least three guerrillas were killed in the clash Thursday off
the port of Tyre in south Lebanon, a police spokesman said.
   It was not known how many Palestinians were aboard the dinghies.
   Spokesmen for the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon said
they could not confirm the police report. There was no comment from
any Palestinian faction.
   Syrian-based Palestinian groups, which have been responsible for
many recent attacks against Israel, denied any involvement.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said he knew nothing
about the incident.

<HEAD>Fewer Apprehended On Southern Border, But More Non-Mexicans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of illegal aliens apprehended on
the southern U.S. border has reached a six-year low, but the
numbers of non-Mexican aliens arrested increased over fiscal 1987,
immigration officials said Friday.
   ``The decline in apprehensions confirms the downward trend that
began immediately after passage of the Immigration Reform and
Control Act and shows that the law is working as it was intended,''
said Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   Apprehensions totaled more than 940,000 in the fiscal year
ending Oct. 1, while there were 1.12 million apprehensions in
fiscal 1987 and a record 1.62 million in 1986.
   At a news conference, Nelson acknowledged that temporary
reassignment of some border control agents during the fiscal year
may account for some of the decline. He said other factors are the
decreased number of illegal aliens in the United States because of
mass legalizations under the 1986 immigration act and the fact that
drought conditions contributed to less demand for farm laborers.
   The number of non-Mexican immigrants apprehended increased last
fiscal year to 39,000 from 37,000 in 1987, other officials said,
with about a fourth of those each year from El Salvador and the
rest from more than 100 other countries.
   Nelson said the fact that the trend has not been the same for
non-Mexicans is probably ``a function of distance.'' He said people
who have to travel greater distances from other countries to the
border are more likely not to be deterred by aggressive enforcement
or changes in immigration laws.
   Nelson said the INS increased its Border Patrol forces to record
numbers during the year, with plans to have 1,400 new agents on
duty by next June, bringing the total along the southern border to
4,300. Investigation staff has increased 75 percent since last
fiscal year, he said.
   This has resulted in apprehension of 50,000 criminal aliens, up
from 33,500 a year earlier, Nelson said.
   ``These figures show we are making more effective use of our
enforcement resources by concentrating them on the most serious
problems of illegal immigration _ that is, we go after the aliens
who are causing the most harm to society,'' he said.
   Border Patrol seizures of narcotics along the southern border
increased from 2,751 cases to more than 3,000 last year, increasing
in value by $100 million to $681.1 million for the fiscal year,
Nelson said.
   He said the INS has received 2.65 million applications for
temporary resident status under the immigration law, including
nearly twice as many as expected under the less restrictive program
for special agricultural workers _ more than 890,000.
   Nelson said 97.5 percent of regular applications and 92 percent
of those under the agricultural program are approved. Farm-worker
applicants have to show only that they worked on a U.S. farm for 90
days during the previous year to get legal status.
   Officials say there are some cases of obvious fraud in the
program, including applicants who obviously are too well manicured
to be farm workers and some who claim such things as having picked
strawberries from trees.
   Of pending cases, 168,000 are suspected to be fraudulent
applicants, including 136,000 for the agricultural program, said
Nelson. He said fewer than 51,000 applications have been denied
under the immigration act, with 2,844 involving fraud.

<HEAD>The Debate: Lost Opportunity for Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even Democrats acknowledged Friday that
Michael Dukakis' race was made no easier by his final debate with
George Bush, leaving the Democrat with a little over three weeks to
make up a lot of ground _ and to hope for a mistake by the vice
president.
   The first polls suggested a victory for Bush while both sides
pushed the view that their man had won.
   But the next day's judgment by leaders in both parties seemed to
be that the debate was a lost opportunity for Dukakis _ that he
failed to recast the presidential race on his issues and did not
appreciably warm his cool and detatched personal image.
   ``I expected a very aggressive Dukakis and I didn't find it,''
said Republican Senate Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``I'm not sure these debates really amount to much,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, in a remark
that may have reflected Democratic disappointment Dukakis made no
gains.
   Top Dukakis aide John Sasso acknowledged the vice president had
the edge in instant polling taken after the two presidential
nominees met in Los Angeles Thursday night for their second and
final debate. He maintained, however, that Dukakis' performance was
good enough.
   ``We scored with undecided and swing voters last evening. That's
what we were looking for,'' Sasso said.
   ``We're down a little bit (in the polls), there's no question
about that,'' he added. ``But it's well within range.''
   An ABC News survey called the vice president the winner, by 49
percent to 33 percent. A Los Angeles Times poll had it 47 to 26
with the rest unsure.
   With Dukakis trailing at least slightly in most national polls _
and by larger amounts in Electoral College handicapping _ the
question was how the Democrats could turn things around.
   ``He has to get on the offensive and put George Bush on the
defensive,'' said Norman Ornstein, analyst at the conservative
American Enterprise Institute. And then hope Bush makes a mistake,
he added.
   Nowhere was the debate watched more closely than in the big,
battleground states where Bush and Dukakis' fates lie. New York
Democratic chairman Laurence Kirwan said Dukakis ``did everything
he thought he could do'' and performed well, but he acknowledged
Bush may be seen as winning the encounter.
   ``Bush may have exceeded expectations,'' Kirwan said. ``A lot of
people say he has difficulty in a lengthy format, putting two
sentences together. That obviously was not a problem for him last
night. He came out quite well.''
   In Cleveland, former Cayahoga County Democratic chairman and
county commissioner Tim Hagan said Dukakis won the debate on issues
_ ``but Bush won on likability.''
   He said Dukakis likely remains well short of the 60 percent
support a Democrat usually needs in Cleveland if he is to carry the
state.
   ``Sure it's disappointing,'' he said. ``We have to pitch a
perfect game between now and Nov. 8.''
   Democratic consultant Ann Lewis said hopes for a breakthrough by
either candidate weren't realistic. She said Dukakis now must run
``a ground strategy,'' pounding on a few economic themes and
relying on organization to produce a high Democratic turnout.
   ``We really are where we were yesterday at this time,'' she said.
   Bush campaign manager James Baker III saw a conflict in Dukakis'
objectives going into the debate: Dukakis needed to appear more
warm and likable, since his dour demeanor was judged to have hurt
him before, but also had to be on the offensive as the race's
underdog.
   ``It's pretty hard to attack in a debate and at the same time
appear more likable,'' said Baker. ``So it was a very difficult
situation for him, I think.''
   Some neutral political observers judged Dukakis's performance,
and the outlook for his candidacy, harshly.
   ``I'd say the road to the election for Dukakis is rougher today
than it was yesterday,'' said Larry Sabato, University of Virginia
political analyst. ``He simply wasn't near his best. ... He missed
so many chances to redefine himself, to pull the heartstrings.''

   U.S. industrial production in September failed
to rise for the first time in seven months, the government said
Friday, suggesting to economists that the overheated manufacturing
sector is cooling a bit.
   The Federal Reserve Board said output at the nation's facories,
mines and utilities was unchanged last month after increasing a
slight 0.2 percent in August and an unusually large 1.2 percent in
July.
   The production index has gone 12 months without a decline, but
September was the first time since February that it did not rise.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm, said the weakness in September was almost
entirely due to cutbacks at electricity plants.
   ``There was a 4.3 percent drop in utility production because
people weren't using their air conditioners as much,'' he said.
Utility output shrank to nearly the May level, before the summer
heat wave.
   But even without the drop at utilities, production expanded
slowly last month. It was up only 0.2 percent at manufacturing
plants, following a 0.1 percent rise in August. Mining output,
which includes oil and gas drilling, was up 0.2 percent following a
0.8 percent decrease.
   Manufacturing has been the star of the economy this year. The
lower value of the dollar has made American goods less expensive on
overseas markets and fueled an export boom.
   The boom was so vigorous that analysts this summer began
worrying that factories wouldn't be able to keep up, leading to
shortages and price increases.
   However, Wyss said, ``The fear that the economy was overheating
proved to be rather overheated.''
   Michael K. Evans, an economic consultant in Washington, said
U.S. export sales in 1989 will not be able to sustain the rapid
growth of this year.
   A survey released by Dun & Bradstreet Corp. earlier this week
showed that plant managers' expectations for increased orders
declined for the second quarter in a row.
   ``Manufacturers see their orders shriveling up and they've
decided `Hey, it's time to cut back,''' Evans said.
   Within the manufacturing sector, production of durable goods _
``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years _ was up
0.3 percent, while non-durables were up 0.2 percent.
   Auto production jumped to 7.4 million units, from 7.0 million in
August.
   Business equipment, particularly machinery purchased by
manufacturers seeking to gear up for the export boom, has been one
of the strongest sectors of the economy. Production in September
rose 0.4 percent to a level 10 percent higher than a year ago.
   There was also strength in non-electrical machinery and
chemicals, but steel production fell for the second consecutive
month after rising sharply in July.
   Total output of factories, mines and utilities in September left
the Fed's index at 138.3 percent of a 1977 base and 5.5 percent
higher than a year ago.

   Hundreds of Northwest Airlines passengers
have been stricken with an illness that state health officials said
Friday may be linked to contaminated food served aboard at least
four flights.
   ``We have cases all over the country,'' said state
epidemiologist Michael Osterholm. ``This morning, we were dealing
with a family as far away as Germany.
   ``The one common phrase being reported (to investigators) is
people thinking they have never been so sick, that they thought
they were going to die,'' Osterholm said.
   Four reports were confirmed Thursday as cases of the bacterial
illness shingellosis, and Osterholm said he expects more than 100
additional cases to be confirmed in the next several weeks.
   The people who were confirmed with the illness were on stretches
of a Northwest flight that originated in Minneapolis-St. Paul and
went to Nashville, Detroit and Seattle, as well as on a Minnesota
Vikings football team charter flight to Miami, Osterholm said. The
flights were between Sept. 25 to Oct. 4.
   ``We have no reason to believe it is happening now,'' Osterholm
said.
   The outbreak first came to light after 21 players and staff
members of the football team became acutely ill two to five days
after their game in Miami Oct. 2.
   All the illnesses confirmed so far have been traced to food
prepared in Marriott Corp.'s airline kitchen at the Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport. The facility serves 100,000 meals a
week for the airline.
   ``Marriott has taken extraordinary measures to see it's not
happening now,'' Osterholm said.
   Alan Munchaster, vice president of corporate relations for
Northwest, said preliminary tests on Marriott employees who may
have handled the food were negative. Additional tests were being
conducted by Marriott to pinpoint the source of the bacteria,
Munchaster said.
   ``They're looking at cold food and the lettuce,'' Munchaster
said. ``Those seem to be the culprits.''
   Shigellosis is an intestinal infection that causes intense
diarrhea and other symptoms that can last for five to seven days.
The illness spreads easily from person to person.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Blood Pressure Problems Begin in Childhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of children in nine British towns suggests
that blood pressure problems are rooted in childhood, researchers
reported Friday.
   But they also found a baffling variation in blood pressure
levels in the different towns.
   Writing in the Lancet, the prestigious British medical weekly,
doctors from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London
said they measured blood pressure on 4,186 children aged 5 to 7 in
southern England, Wales and Scotland.
   When the results were compared with earlier surveys of adults in
the same towns, the researchers reported, it was found that the
average blood pressure patterns of the children followed those of
the grown-ups.
   ``Blood pressure has always been regarded as a problem of middle
age, and what we're suggesting is that the roots of the problem
could be in childhood or earlier,'' Dr. Peter Whincup, one of the
researchers, said in an interview.
   But the variations among different towns was inexplicable. ``I
think we've unearthed a mystery,'' said Whincup.
   The average systolic blood pressure (SBP) of children was lowest
in Guildford, southern England, between 96 and 97, and highest in
Carlisle, Northern England, and Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, where it was
between 99 and 101, the study showed.
   One hypothesis for variations in blood pressure levels is
regional differences in diet and environment. Such patterns did not
show up in the latest study, however.
   Guildford, in southern England, showed an SBP average much lower
than the other towns studied. But Maidstone and Exeter, which are
also in southern England, registered six units of SBP higher than
Guildford.
   All three towns are affluent, and have no recognizable
differences of diet and environment to explain the disparity.
   Other studies have shown higher blood pressure among children in
migrant families, suggesting change of environment plays a part.
But these conditions did not apply in the British towns that were
studied, Whincup said.
   He stressed that the study did not suggest the children had
blood pressure problems. In all the towns, the average SBPs were
well within normal limits for that age group, Whincup said.

<TEXT>
   A former volunteer firefighter in
neighboring Jefferson has admitted setting about 17 of the more
than 20 arson fires that have plagued the area since May,
prosecutors said Friday.
   ``Given the nature and number of these offenses, defendant poses
a serious risk to the safety of the community and should be held
without bail,'' Coos County Attorney Pierre Morin said in a motion
for a bail hearing held Friday for Lance Lalumiere.
   Lalumiere, 23, a restaurant dishwasher, was charged Wednesday
with setting one fire and state police said they planned to seek
indictments charging him with 15 others.
   Morin's motion said that in addition to the Aug. 23 fire
Lalumiere is formally charged with setting, ``defendant has given
statements admitting to committing some 16 other acts of arson in
the Jefferson, N.H., area.''
   Jefferson, population 850, has had 21 suspicious fires since
May. Nearby towns have had at least three others, including one
Oct. 3 in Dalton for which a second suspect was charged Thursday.
   Lalumiere's bail was set at $50,000 Wednesday. Friday's bail
hearing was continued until next week.
   The fires began in brush and fields and escalated to buildings.
No one was been killed or seriously injured, although many were
left homeless.
   The original charge against Lalumiere involves an Aug. 23 fire
at his brother Michael's cabin. Lalumiere reported the fire and was
there trying to put it out when firefighters arrived. He had been
asked to quit the fire department earlier in the year when he moved
briefly to a neighboring town.
   On Thursday, Lawrence Coulter Jr., 19, also a Jefferson
volunteer firefighter and lifelong resident, was arrested and
charged with setting fire to a vacation home in nearby Dalton.
Police said that fire went out on its own.

<TEXT>
   Students clad in military fatigues
created a traffic jam Friday in this village of 3,000 by stopping
motorists at concrete block ``Berlin Walls'' to hand out
get-out-the-vote pamphlets.
   But feelings ran so high over the congested traffic and the
``Check Point Charlie'' atmosphere that the vocational education
students had to tear down the walls by late morning.
   ``We don't want to harass anyone,'' said Herb Locy, the masonry
teacher from the Ashtabula County Joint Vocational School who
organized the effort. He said the walls were supposed to give
residents a better feeling for what it would be like to live in a
police state, thus increasing interest in voting.
   ``If they're provoked as it is, how would they feel if it was
the real thing?'' Locy said. He said that by the time the decision
was made to dismantle the walls, the students had handed out most
of the 1,000 pamphlets that encouraged residents to vote Nov. 8.
   The walls were 4 feet, 6 inches high and made of stacked
concrete blocks. One had red stars and the words ``Stop USSR'' and
``Check Point Charlie'' painted on it. More than a dozen students,
wearing green fatigues borrowed from a National Guard unit in
Youngstown, manned the check points that simulated those in
communist East Berlin.
   Police officer Dwayne Patrick said police received at least 100
complaints from drivers about the walls at three main intersections.
   ``But it was approved by the Village Council, so unless we get a
bad accident, there's really nothing we can do,'' he said.
   Some complained because only one car at a time could pass
through a narrow opening and other complaints were from ``people
getting the wrong idea because of what was written on the walls,''
he said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says Debating Bush Like Eating Jell-O With Fork</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen said Friday
that debating George Bush is ``like trying to eat Jell-O with a
fork'' but that he thought Michael Dukakis had managed the task
well.
   Still, he said, polls suggesting Dukakis lost Thursday night's
debate and indicating he is trailing in the presidential race mean
``we have a tough fight down to the end.''
   Bentsen, who watched the debate on television in his home state
of Texas, flew to California Friday to greet Dukakis at a
post-debate rally at the state capitol.
   ``He's a real pressure player. He stepped up and delivered for
America,'' Bentsen told the Sacramento crowd.
   ``Debating George Bush is just like trying to eat Jell-O with a
fork,'' he said. ``It keeps slipping off, sliding off, and when you
finally get a bite there's not much substance to it, just a lot of
sugar water and artificial ingredients.''
   Bentsen told reporters aboard his campaign jet on the trip from
Texas that he thought Dukakis ``did an excellent job'' in the
debate. ``I think he was warm. He was friendly. He was precise. He
spoke to the issues. He gave answers to the questions.''
   ``He was feeling pretty good about it. So was I,'' said Bentsen,
describing a post-debate conversation between the two Democrats.
   Bentsen objected to a question from one reporter on what it
meant to the campaign that Dukakis failed to score a knockout punch
against Bush.
   ``I never said he had to get a knockout punch. That was you
folks. You were buying the Republican line,'' he said. ``When
you're three or four points behind, what you want to do is speak to
the issues, and I think that those issues, keep repeating them,
they'll sink in and we'll win it.''
   ``You know, middle-income America, that is who Dukakis is
talking to,'' he said, ``real concerns'' such as home ownership and
college costs.
   ``I think those things finally get across. I think that's why
we're still in the running,'' he said.
   ``I don't think he dealt with issues that are going to have
voters jumping up on their chairs,'' he said. ``But he dealt with
the real concerns about their futures, and I think that is a more
lasting approach to the issues.''
   Bentsen did have some criticism, agreeing in part with comments
by House Speaker Jim Wright this week that Dukakis needed to speak
directly to voters and dump his TV ad package.
   ``When it comes to the expenditure of funds and all ... more
time on radio to discuss the issues so you're not 30-second bites,
I believe, would be more effective, frankly,'' he said.
   The Texas senator called the opening question of the debate,
when Dukakis was asked what he'd do if someone attacked and killed
his wife, ``a horrible question ... almost an outrageous question.''
   He declined to criticize Dukakis for being unemotional in his
response.
   ``He is against capital punishment he thinks that's not a
deterrent to crime,'' he said. ``I'm sure he would have done what
he could to put that fellow in jail for a lifetime to rot.''
   Asked if he would have responded the same way, Bentsen said,
``I'm not going to try to second guess him.''

   Jimmy Swaggart Ministries has stopped
work on a $12.9 million construction program that was begun shortly
before he was defrocked by the Assemblies of God.
   ``We're trusting sometime next year _ in the middle of the year
or late spring _ to get back (to construction). Those are hopes,''
said board member and spokesman Bill Treeby of New Orleans.
   The six abandoned contracts include an $11 million dormitory at
Jimmy Swaggart Bible College; nearly $860,000 for road work;
$806,000 for landscaping and a mechanical building; and $156,000
for electrical work.
   Treeby said recently that the ministry has settled all claims
with contractors.
   The Assemblies of God dismissed Swaggart in February after he
refused a rehabilitation program they ordered. The order was the
result of Swaggart's teary confession that he had committed
unspecified sins.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages fell to the lowest level in five months this week,
according to a nationwide mortgage survey released Friday.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., a government-chartered
corporation owned by savings institutions and known as Freddie Mac,
said fixed-rate mortgages average 10.33 percent this week, down
from 10.38 percent last week.
   That was the lowest since rates averaged 10.32 percent in the
week ending May 6. The averages do not include add-on fees known as
points.
   Fixed-rate mortgages hit a high for the year of 10.71 percent in
the week ending Aug. 19. That was the week after the Federal
Reserve Board raised the discount rate, a key bank lending rate, in
an effort to cool economic growth it believed was leading to
accelerating inflation.
   However, since then the Fed has not found it necessary to
tighten further because a number of signs of slowing have emerged,
including declines in retail sales, lackluster growth in industrial
production and less robust employment growth.
   Yields on long-term bonds have been falling in recent weeks and
mortgage rates have followed along.
   However, short-term interest rates have eased only slightly.
Freddie Mac said rates on the most popular type of one-year,
adjustable-rate mortgages, those with caps on how high the interest
can go, averaged 8.11 percent last week, down slightly from the
peak of 8.16 percent six weeks ago.
   Adjustable rates this year have averaged as low as 7.49 percent
in March, while fixed rates hit a post-stock market crash low of
9.84 percent in February.

   Officials of the Bureau of Land Management and
a wild horse protection group joined Friday in urging an informant
to contact them about the slaughter of 450 Nevada mustangs.
   Dick Wright, chairman of the Washoe County Secret Witness
program, said a person called a few days ago indicating he or she
had information on the horse kill and wanted to speak to
authorities.
   ``They never called back,'' Wright told a news conference. ``We
believe this witness has information that could be crucial to this
case.''
   Wright said the caller had refused to stay on the line and hung
up without giving any information. Wright urged the person to call
back Secret Witness which he said hasn't been receiving many other
tips about the slaughter discovered two months ago.
   ``We assure them they will remain anonymous,'' he said.
   Bob Stewart, public information officer for the BLM, announced
that the Department of Interior added $5,000 to reward money for
any person who provides information leading to the arrest and
prosecution of the horse killers.
   The total reward offered now is $17,000, including money from
the Humane Society and other animal protection groups including the
state Commission for the Preservation of Wild Horses.
   Discovery of the slaughter began in August with the helicopter
siting of 41 carcasses in the Austin area. The discoveries have
spread over 102,000 acres in central Nevada's Lander County and now
total 450.
   Investigators say the killings apparently began about two years
ago, though some of the horses were shot late this spring or early
this summer.
   Stewart, who refused to release details bout any leads or
suspects in the case, said investigation has been difficult because
the shootings are spread over such a vast area.

   The government announced plans
Friday to ease an unpopular austerity program, three days before it
meets to consider widespread demands for resignations in its
leadership.
   The Central Committees of four of Yugoslavia's six republics and
of ethnically troubled Kosovo province also met Friday to iron out
political rifts as fiery politicking continued before Monday's
meeting of the policy-setting national Central Committee.
   Several Serbian Communist Party groups, including the
influential Belgrade city organization, joined calls for the
resignation of national party chief Stipe Suvar.
   Milanko Renovica, a member of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo and a former party chief, became the third member of the
23-man body to offer his resignation in the past three weeks, the
state news agency Tanjug reported Friday. The move was expected to
be ratified Monday.
   Deputy Premier Janez Zemljaric said Yugoslavia would import $600
million in emergency staples _ triple the amount announced Oct. 8
by the government _ to ease the worst economic crisis in the
country in four decades.
   Belgrade dailies said the government also would increase wages
for workers in profitable companies and in social services.
   The Serbian Communist Party groups attacked Suvar Friday for
criticizing Serbia the day before. Belgrade Communist chief Rados
Smijlkovic was among leading Serbian officials who charged that
Suvar is trying to turn Monday's meeting into an indictment of
Yugoslavia's largest republic.
   Suvar has promised a shake-up of top personnel following three
months of economic protests and nearly daily ethnic rallies led by
Serbian nationalists.
   During the Kosovo meeting, Communists representing the
province's ethnic Albanian majority and others from its Slav
minority clashed on several issues, Belgrade radio said.
   Serbians have demanded more control over its autonomous province
in rallies and prompted an unprecedented power struggle. The mainly
Christian minority accuse mainly Moslem ethnic Albanians of
harassment.
   At the Kosovo meeting, Serb and Montenegrin representatives
demanded the resignation of the province's mostly ethnic Albanian
communist leadership, the official news agency Tanjug said.
   In Albania, the Communist Party daily Zeri i Popullit charged
Yugoslavia's Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and his followers
with spearheading a campaign of discrimination against Albanians
similar to apartheid in South Africa.
   ``It seems the hotheads of Serb chauvinism seek to set not only
Kosovo and Yugoslavia on fire, but the Balkans as well,'' said the
newspaper in comments carried by the official Albanian news agency
ATA. ``We would advise them not to play with fire.''
   In Yugoslavia's liberal northern republic of Slovenia, its
official youth organization demanded direct elections and the
``formal abandonment of a one-party system,'' the Belgrade daily
Borba said.
   The government imposed an austerity program last May designed to
curb a $21 billion foreign debt and 217 percent annual inflation by
reducing or freezing wages and allowing prices to rise.
   The new pay increases will be adopted by Parliament by the end
of the month, Belgrade dailies said.
   The newspapers said the International Monetary Fund had approved
the measures. The IMF and other Western creditors insisted on the
austerity program before rescheduling debt payments and extending
new loans.
   At the meeting of Kosovo's Communist leaders, representatives of
Kosovo's Serb and Montenegrin minority demanded the resignation of
the province's mostly ethnic Albanian Communist leadership, Tanjug
said.
   In the southern republic of Montenegro, where police used tear
gas and clubs to break up anti-government protests last weekend,
republican party chief Miljan Radovic complained that
``anti-Socialist and anti-Communist'' outbursts never heard before
are now so common that ``it gives a man the chills.''
   Hundreds of Montenegrin students are boycotting university
cafeterias to press demands for the leaders' ouster and free
elections. They have refused official appeals to stop their action.

   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley lashed out Friday
at what he called an ``offensive'' television attack on Democratic
colleague Frank Lautenberg by Peter Dawkins, the Republican
challenger to Lautenberg's Senate seat.
   ``This makes me angry. It's offensive to me,'' Bradley said of
the Dawkins' commerical depicting Lautenberg as motivated by greed.
Dawkins, a retired Army general and investment banker, is seeking
to deny Lautenberg a second term.
   The ad, which ran on New York and Philadelphia television this
week, ends: ``Frank Lautenberg: He'll deny anything to get elected
... as long as he can make some money on the side.''
   Bradley, who is chairing Lautenberg's re-election effort, said
that the ad ``goes beyond the line of propriety.'' The news
conference was held at Democratic national headquarters.
   The 30-second commercial accuses Lautenberg, a multimillionaire,
of conflicts of interest between his office and his investments, of
greedily voting for a Senate pay raise, and of accepting campaign
money from ``toxic polluters.''
   Bradley said Lautenberg, former top officer of the worldwide
Automatic Data Processing Corp., took a ``gigantic'' pay cut in
coming to the Senate and has no motive to use his office for
personal financial gain.
   But Dawkins spokesman Bill Kenyon said Lautenberg, not Dawkins,
began the negative advertising. ``It's interesting they feel
compelled to bring out their big gun,'' he said. ``We'd like to see
Frank stand on his own two feet.''
   Both Lautenberg and Dawkins have been engaging in increasingly
negative attacks, and their race is becoming one of the nastiest in
the nation.
   Lautenberg surprised observers in September when he used his
first paid television time to question Dawkins' motives in moving
to New Jersey.
   Most analysts expected the senator's first commercials to be
positive promotions of his legislative record.
   Negative advertising by both sides has continued since.
   The gutterfight continued face to face when the two met
Wednesday in their first debate. They devoted little time to
issues, concentrating more on insults.

   A triumphant Margaret Thatcher wound up
her Conservative Party's annual conference Friday rejecting the
notion of a politically unified Western Europe and pledging to
support the next U.S. president.
   To thunderous applause and chants of ``10 more years'' from the
4,500 delegates, the prime minister also declared her Conservatives
will hold power into the 1990s _ ``And who knows, beyond.''
   ``We are all too young to put our feet up ... I include
myself,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, who turned 63 Thursday.
   Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979, has won three elections in
a row and already is the longest-serving leader in the Western
world.
   On the subject of the European Economic Community, Mrs. Thatcher
charged that advocates of closer political union wanted to use the
12-nation trade bloc ``as a vehicle for spreading socialism'' and
sought to ``bring about a federal Europe by stealth.''
   In remarks widely regarded as setting a new agenda to focus on
social issues, the prime minister also urged Britons to maintain a
``generous society'' and exercise civic responsibility.
   Millions of Britons have become richer through nearly a decade
of Mrs. Thatcher's right-wing economic policies. But unemployment,
at 8 percent, is twice as high as in 1979, and critics charge
Britain has become a greedy, materialistic and uncaring society.
   At the end of the prime minister's 45-minute address, delegates
waved Union Jacks and huge, blue party flags while Mrs. Thatcher,
her grip on the Conservatives unchallenged, stood with arms raised
acknowledging the cheers.
   As Mrs. Thatcher left the hall in this south England resort to
the strains of the favorite Tory anthem, ``Land of Hope and
Glory,'' some delegates waved signs declaring ``Bush-Thatcher 88''
and ``Bush-Quayle.''
   Mrs. Thatcher did not mention by name Republican presidential
candidate George Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, or
Democratic contender Michael Dukakis.
   Of President Reagan, with whom she has developed a particularly
close relationship through the 80s, Mrs. Thatcher said he ``has
rebuilt the strength and confidence of the West _ not without a
little help _ and inspired the democracies to go out and win the
battle of ideas.''
   ``It is vital that Britain and America should always stand
together. So the next president of the United States too will have
the United Kingdom as a staunch ally,'' she added.
   Mrs. Thatcher's blunt remarks on the EEC followed a
controversial speech last month in which she rejected moves for
closer political or monetary union after 1992, when all trade
barriers among member nations are to be dismantled.
   ``We haven't worked all these years to free Britain from the
paralysis of socialism only to see it creep through the back door
of central control and bureacracy from Brussels,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said.
   The chief bureaucrat at the EEC headquarters in the Belgian
capital, Commisssioner Jacques Delors, is a French socialist.
   The remarks were Mrs. Thatcher's clearest rejection yet of what
she sees as unrealistic talk of some form of political union in
Western Europe.
   On the Irish Republican Army, which blew up her hotel here in an
assassination attempt during the 1984 party conference, Mrs.
Thatcher said her government would never compromise with terrorists
``at home and abroad.''
   ``If they IRA think they can weary us or frighten us, they have
made a terrible miscalculation,'' she said of the guerrilla
movement fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   As she headed back to London, police dismantled the biggest
security operation ever mounted around a British party convention.
The four-day gathering was the Tories' first in Brighton since 1984.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 16 months into her third term, holds a five-point
lead of over the opposition socialist Labor Party.
   But she is sensitive to charges by Labor that the well off have
benefited from big tax cuts, while the poorest have been hit by her
rein on state spending.

   A university Academic Senate here
spent 90 minutes wrangling over a decision to expel stray cats from
the campus.
   When some professors groused that the issue was not lofty enough
for the senate's attention, the cat fight began in earnest Thursday
at California State University.
   ``I think this is not frivolous, I think it is paramount,''
bristled English professor Gerald Locklin. ``But not because of the
cats. I am not a cat lover. Cats hate me. I add vodka to their
water dishes, and they still hate me. I am not an animal rights
advocate. I love bullfights.
   ``In the past few years, we've had a new era of collegiality
here. The mutual respect has been glorious. But now I begin to hear
contempt and this take-it-or-leave-it attitude.''
   The expulsion decision by the campus animal welfare board was
undemocratic and could result in a rat infestation, said Kathy
Billing, a thesis reviewer.
   ``Our contention is the board made a resolution which it had no
right to make,'' she said.
   University Vice President John Beljan was unbending, and the
stray cats must be gone by Nov. 28.
   The board is required by law to set protocol for all animals on
campus, including pets, Beljan said.

   The Pentagon still doesn't talk officially
about its Stealth aircraft. But Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
is not above discussing some of the men who fly the planes.
   Carlucci, appearing in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Friday to
deliver a speech before the Society of Experimental Test Pilots,
identified by name two pilots ``who flew in the earliest days of
Stealth aircraft development.''
   The secretary lauded ``men like Bill Park and Ken Dyson'' as
``unsung heroes'' and ``the backbone of our nation's defenses.''
   ``Although for now your achievements must remain private, the
results can be seen in the successes America is realizing
throughout the world,'' Carlucci declared. ``The time will come
when history will fully record your accomplishments.''
   A copy of Carlucci's speech was released in Washington.
   Norman Kenneth Dyson is the chief test pilot for the Rockwell
International Corp., and William M. Park is director of flight
operations for advanced development projects at the Lockheed Corp.
   Although Dyson was described in a recent book as a test pilot
involved in flying experimental Stealth aircraft, the Pentagon and
Air Force never have acknowledged the work of either man on such
programs.
   Rockwell was the prime contractor on the B-1B bomber, an Air
Force plane that incorporates some Stealth _ or radar-evading _
design features, but it was not clear whether Carlucci was
referring to work by Dyson while employed by Rockwell.
   Mike Matthews, a Rockwell spokesman, said Friday that Dyson did
not join the company until 1983. He was unable to say where Dyson
had worked previously.
   Lockheed, meantime, developed and produced a Stealth fighter for
the Air Force starting in the late 1970s and extending into the
1980s, defense sources have said.
   Jim Ragsdale, a Lockheed spokesman, said Friday he was not at
liberty ``to discuss the work of Park that prompted the mention by
Secretary Carlucci.''
   Carlucci, who recently scuttled a plan to unveil Lockheed's
Stealth fighter before the presidential election, said Friday the
United States ``must not falter in (its) commitment to developing
state-of-the-art weapons systems.''
   ``Our latest generation of aircraft ... with their Stealth
technology represent the pinnacle of American scientific
leadership. Not since the Manhattan Project (to develop an atomic
bomb) have we seen a program cloaked in such secrecy and a
technology with such enormous potential to guarantee the security
of our nation.
   ``However,'' he continued, ``we must not forget that the success
of weapon development programs like these requires the hard work,
sacrifice and dedication of many individuals _ men like Bill Park
and Ken Dyson, who flew in the earliest days of Stealth aircraft
development.''

Hurricane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday prepared to
lift a monthlong state of emergency imposed after hurricane Gilbert
ravaged Jamaica, but a nighttime curfew to prevent looting was to
remain in force.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga said in a nationwide radio address
Thursday that the state of emergency covering four eastern
parishes, including the capital of Kingston, was no longer
necessary and would be lifted at midnight Friday.
   But he said the nightly curfew would remain in effect until
electricity is sufficiently restored.
   ``This is necessary because many homes and places of businesses
are damaged and still insecure,'' Seaga said.
   The government ordered the state of emergency on Sept. 15, three
days after the hurricane struck the Caribbean island with 145 mph
winds, killing 45 people and causing damage estimated at between
$800 million and $1 billion.
   Under the emergency order police were empowered to force
businesses providing essential services, such as gasoline stations,
to open if they could. The government was allowed to requisition
trucks and heavy equipment for distributing supplies and cleanup
work.
   The order included a curfew because of looting of warehouses and
stores in the first days after the hurricane. Seaga said the curfew
sharply reduced the looting.
   The emergency order covered the parishes of Kingston, St.
Andrew, St. Catherine and St. Thomas _ an area housing about half
of Jamaica's population of 2.3 million.

<TEXT>
   Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis are
committed to openness in government and support the Freedom of
Information Act, the candidates said in answer to questions put by
the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   The editors' association released on Friday the presidential
candidates' answers to a series of questions regarding the First
Amendment, openness of their administration, attitudes toward press
conferences and other press issues.
   In the answers, Dukakis pledged opposition to the use of
mandatory lie detector tests to track down the source of government
leaks to the press.
   Bush said access to the president is ``absolutely vital'' for a
press secretary, and that he and his spokesman should have ``a
close, personal working relationship.''
   Both candidates were given written questions in early August,
and they responded in writing in September and October.
   Both were asked their views regarding the conduct of government
business in the open.
   Bush responded: ``Within the limits of national security,
government should be open to scrutiny by the media and the public.
... The information process from a news conference to the Freedom
of Information Act is an appropriate and integral part of ensuring
that accountability.''
   Dukakis responded: ``A Dukakis administration would fully comply
with the Freedom of Information Act. The fundamental premise of
this statute is that American citizens have the right to know about
he activities of their own government. The current administration
claims that complying with the FOIA is too time consuming, too
expensive, and too bothersome. These are excuses for government
secrecy. And they could serve as a cloak for incompetence,
mismanagement, illegality or corruption.''
   Both were asked if they would hold regular, frequent news
conferences, and how often they would be held.
   Bush said he would hold a combination of press conferences,
interviews, and news conferences with regional media by satellite.
He declined to say how many.
   Dukakis said that as governor of Massachusetts ``I have been
accessible to Statehouse reporters several times a week. ... As
president, I would hope to continue this pattern.''
   Each was asked if they would continue the practice of arranging
for press coverage _ by a small pool if necessary _ to go into
military operations with U.S. forces.
   Dukakis said he would ``require the secretary of defense and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop policies which ensure that members
of the press are able to provide coverage of military operations.''
   Bush stopped short of such a pledge. He said the public has a
right to know details of military operations ``in an appropriate
time frame and in a way that does not risk national security. But
the safety of the troops and success of the mission must be
paramount, and I will risk neither.''
   Both were asked if they would use lie detectors to track down
the source of leaks.
   Bush left open their use, responding that his administration
will be open but ``that doesn't mean every staff member will be
authorized to serve as an administration spokesman or interpreter
of events and policies.''
   Dukakis said, ``I am strongly opposed to mandatory lie detector
tests ... to determine the source of leaks to the press.''
   Dukakis denounced efforts to amend the Freedom of Information
Act by the Reagan administration as ``excuses for government
secrecy.''
   Bush said disagreements over the scope of the act will be up to
the courts.
   Dukakis said he opposed the use of press credentials as cover
for covert operations by intelligence agencies. Bush, asked about
the use of credentials, did not state a view but said the CIA and
other agencies ``must obey the law.''
   The full questions and answers are published in the
September-October issue of The Bulletin, the ASNE's monthly
magazine.

<HEAD>Court Denies Claim That U.S. Policy Injures Americans in Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld the
dismissal of a lawsuit by Americans living in Nicaragua to stop
U.S. aid to the Contras on the ground their lives and property are
endangered by rebel attacks.
   But the decision appeared to leave open the possibility that
courts could entertain well-documented claims by Americans living
abroad that their lives were endangered by foreign policy
initiatives of Congress and the president.
   The three-judge panel said a federal district judge should not
have refused to examine claims of injury and property damage on the
ground that foreign policy issues cannot be adjudicated in courts.
   Instead, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here dismissed the
claims on the basis there was no proof that the government was
aware the Contras were targeting American citizens in Nicaragua for
harassment or attacks.
   ``There must be a much stronger allegation of deliberate
targeting of Americans by the Contras, and of congressional
awareness of that targeting, before the possibility of due process
violation would arise,'' the court said in an opinion by Judge
Abner Mikva.
   The decision was made on a 1986 lawsuit by the Committee of
United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua to stop military aid to
the Contras on the ground that it violated international law and
the due process rights of liberty and property.
   The appeals court said U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey had
improperly invoked the ``political doctrine'' to dismiss claims on
the ground they raised foreign policy issues that courts cannot
address.
   Richey may have applied the doctrine correctly to claims that
U.S. aid to the Contras violated a finding of the International
Court of Justice.
   But Richey erred, the court said, when he dismissed the
due-process claims on the same basis, the court said.
   ``Given the care with which the political question doctrine
should be applied and given the variety of claims encompassed by
the present case, we find the trial court's blanket invocation of
the political question doctrine to be inappropriate,'' the court
said in the opinion joined by Judges Spottswood Robinson III and
Myron L. Gordon.

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
says the U.N. should prepare to spend almost $100 million to keep a
Persian Gulf peacekeeping force in place 12 more months, according
to documents released Friday.
   The U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group is monitoring the
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq that began Aug. 20, bringing peace
for the first time since war broke out in September 1980.
   Originally mandated for a six-month period that began Aug. 9,
the force may well have to stay in place during long, arduous peace
negotiations.
   Perez de Cuellar asked the U.N. member nations for $76.5 million
for the first six months of the peacekeeping operations, and now
says the force will cost $99.7 million to extend for a year
beginning in February.
   The U.N. chief's latest report, dated Oct. 10 and released
Friday, provides the first detailed public accounting of how the
$75.6 million that he requested for the force's first six months is
being spent.
   Among the expenses are the purchase of the distinctive blue
berets and helmets for the 350 peacekeepers, fragmentation jackets
and chemical warfare protective clothing.
   Iraq has admitted using chemical weapons against Iran during the
war, but accuses Tehran of having used them first. Iran says it has
the capability to make chemical weapons but has not done so.
   The peacekeepers, deployed along the 730-mile warfront, receive
basic pay of $950 a month plus $65 for personal items. Specialists
receive an extra $280 monthly.
   Rental of fixed-wing aircraft is budgeted at $2.16 million for a
medium-size cargo plane that can carry 20 people, and three light
planes of six-to-10 passenger capacity each.
   A dozen helicopters are being rented at a cost of $3.1 million,
and two marine patrol vessels _ the first U.N. ``navy'' _ are being
rented for $230,000.
   The force plans to spend $6.2 million for vehicles, including
256 jeeps, 15 autos, 27 station wagons, three buses, 11 water
trailers for use in the desert, and dozens of other vans and trucks.
   Communications equipment in the budget includes three code
machines at $30,000 each and four satellite communication ground
stations with a total cost of $1.7 million.
   The General Assembly met in special session in August to assess
its members $35.7 million for the first three months of the force's
cost, and plans to consider the balance of the costs in November.
Approval is expected.

   A union representing employees of Eastern
Airlines filed a request Friday to examine all documents related to
the planned $365 million sale of the carrier's Northeast air
shuttle to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL-CIO, asked U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker to
reopen discovery in a suit in which the union charges that
Eastern's sale of various assets is part of an effort to undermine
the strength of organized labor.
   ``Eastern's present plan to dispose of the air shuttle
constitutes its latest effort to undermine the status of its
unions,'' the Machinists said in papers filed in U.S. District
Court.
   The union said it needed to examine the sale documents in order
to prepare a request for a preliminary injunction to stop the deal
from bing completed.
   The motion noted that the Boston-to-New York-to-Washington
shuttle operation is the only profitable component of the
financially troubled carrier.
   The sale announced earlier this week by Texas Air Corp., which
owns Eastern, and Trump, is expected to be completed in December.

   The Justice Department said Friday that Jesse
Jackson's Push-Excel program will pay the government $550,000 to
settle more than $1 million in claims arising from federal grants
and contracts awarded by the departments of Labor and Education.
   Government audits indicated that some expenditures of Push for
Excellence Inc. either didn't comply with the terms of the
contracts and grants or weren't properly documented, the Justice
Department said in a statement.
   The program will pay $100,000 initially, with the remainder to
be paid in quarterly installments over a five-year period.
   The contracts and grants were awarded in the late 1970s and
early 1980s to finance programs designed to assist minority
children.
   The labor department had made a claim against Push for
Excellence Inc. for $434,600 plus $54,100 in interest as of 1985.
   The education department had asserted a claim of $671,300 plus
$61,800 in interest as of June 1987.
   Jackson launched Push-Excel in 1977 as a program to motivate
black youths to take their academic studies more seriously.
   The program had the backing of the late Vice President Hubert
Humphrey and former Health, Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano. The program received federal grants totaling almost $6
million during the Carter administration.
   No grants were awarded during the Reagan administration, because
of federal audit problems, although some of the previously made
three-year grants continued to 1982.

   Morocco and the Polisario independence
movement in the Western Sahara remain at odds over most major
issues despite having agreed in principle on a regional peace plan,
a Polisario official said Friday.
   The official, Bachir M. Sayed, said Polisario and Morocco so far
have agreed only on the wording of a referendum on the future of
Western Sahara, an arid northwest Africa coastal territory, and on
how voter eligibility will be decided.
   Outstanding issues in dispute include the presence of 185,000
Moroccan troops in the territory; the Moroccan administration; the
tens of thousands of Moroccan settlers who have moved into Western
Sahara and ``the key issue of direct negotiations, still opposed by
Morocco,'' Sayed told reporters.
   ``Morocco still refuses to shake our hand for peace,'' he said.
``It is proof of their lack of political will.''
   A Moroccan official, speaking on condition anonymity, said:
``They want to renegotiate everything. But we say we did come up
with a peace plan that was agreed to by both parties.''
   ``We are not going to pre-empt the population by giving anybody
legitimacy,'' the Moroccan official added. ``The people of Western
Sahara will decide who shall lead them, and whether these people
(Polisario) will lead them.''
   On Sept. 20, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told
the Security Council that Morocco and Polisario had agreed to
proposals, including the framework for a cease-fire in the nearly
13-year-old guerrilla war and a referendum on whether the territory
will become independent or be affiliated with Morocco.
   When the Spanish colonial administration withdrew from their
former possession in 1975, Moroccan troops occupied the Western
Sahara and the Marxist-led Polisario began the fight for
independence.
   More than 10,000 people have died in the war, which has cost
Morocco up to $2 million a day to fight.
   The phosphate-rich desert territory covers about 110,000 square
miles and its population at the last Spanish census in 1974 was
only 76,000.
   Polisario and Morocco have agreed on that census as the basis
for voter eligibility in the upcoming referendum, said Sayed.
   The United Nations plans to send about 2,000 peacekeeping troops
to the Western Sahara to monitor the referendum.

   A former city administrator was arraigned
Friday on 19 felony charges of having sex with teen-age girls in a
brothel.
   The case includes 86 counts against 14 individuals and grew out
of a 16-month police probe, during which five of the prostitutes
identified George Boas as the customer they knew as ``George.''
   The grim-faced Boas, 67, who served as chief administrative
officer under two mayors from 1977 until January 1988, did not
enter a plea and did not speak to reporters.
   Boas, who placed a close third in last year's mayoral primary,
is charged with using the brothel from November 1985 through May,
shortly before it was raided and shut down.
   If convicted, Boas faces up to three years in state prison for
each count, although the sentences could be made concurrent.

   Residents of this Pittsburgh suburb
got an alarming wake-up call before dawn Friday when a siren
normally reserved for a nuclear attack was accidentally activated.
But few paid attention.
   Only about 30 people out of the town's population of about
34,400 called to find out what was going on, said Fire Chief Steve
Walther.
   Walther said an alarm in the Mount Lebanon Municipal Building
was accidentally bumped, setting off the siren's wavery wail
shortly before 5:30 a.m. He did not say who set it off.
   Walther said the siren is designed to sound the up-and-down wail
to warn of an impending nuclear attack. He said it sounds a
continuous drone for a local emergency.
   The siren continued sounding for about three minutes, as
programmed.
   ``We also learned our cancel button doesn't work,'' Walther said.

   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea will
address the General Assembly next Tuesday in the first speech to
the United Nations by a South Korean head of state.
   On Wednesday North Korea's first deputy minister for foreign
affairs, Kang Sok Ju, will make his first appearance before the
General Assembly.
   The North Korean Mission reported Kang would speak but gave no
details.
   A senior South Korean official told reporters Friday that Roh
would deliver a major speech and call for a ``conceptual
breakthrough'' on reuniting the peninsula divided since the end of
World War II.
   South and North Korea have only non-voting observer status in
the 159-member General Assembly because of the division.
   The South Korean official, speaking with the condition his name
not be used, said improved relations between the East and West, the
Soviet Union and the United States and the Soviets and China would
have a positive effect on Korea's reunification efforts.
   China, the Soviet Union and most communist countries are allies
of North Korea but recently have been seeking to improve relations
with U.S.-backed South Korea.
   Both the North and the South have made reunification proposals,
but the North opposes the presence of U.S. forces in the South and
South Korea has sought confidence-building measures including
cultural, family and economic exchanges.
   The South Korean official said North Korea has not been
receptive to such measures and he doubted the North would suggest
any major changes to promote unification.

   Boleslavs Maikovskis, an 83-year-old who was
awaiting deportation to the Soviet Union on charges that he
committed Nazi atrocities in his native Latvia, has secretly left
the country and is believed to be in West Germany, government
sources said Friday.
   Maikovskis had been living in Mineola, N.Y., since 1951, and was
sentenced to death in absentia by the Soviet Union in 1965. He had
been awaiting deportation since 1986, when the Supreme Court turned
down his appeal. Jewish groups in New York had recently been
calling action on Maikovskis' case long overdue.
   ``The order of deportation has been accomplished,'' Neal Sher,
director of the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations, said Friday.
   OSI had had lost track of Maikovskis several months ago, Sher
said, but ``we just found out a day or so ago'' that he had left
the country. Sher declined to say how OSI learned this or where
Maikovskis might have gone.
   But a government source, speaking on condition that he not be
identified, said Maikovskis was in West Germany.
   ``We have no way of knowing how he got there,'' the source said.
Maikovskis had no passport or other travel documents.
   Maikovskis' leaving came to light Friday because the
Anti-Defamation League issued a press release calling on Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh for an ``immediate investigation into
Maikovskis' whereabouts and prompt action to bring him to justice.''
   ``The whole thing is a little bit strange,'' ADL National
Director Abraham Foxman said from New York. ``We are baffled why
the secrecy around this issue.''
   Foxman said the ADL confirmed Thursday that Maikovskis was
missing from his Mineola home and called the Justice Department to
report it.
   ``They said in confidence they know that he's missing and they
know where he is,'' Foxman said. ``So we said, `Why don't you tell
the American people?' They said they can't do that.''
   Sher suggested that the ADL deal with the German authorities.
``His being brought to justice is out of our hands,'' he said.
   Maikovskis had been a chief of a Nazi-created police force in
Latvia during World War II. He is accused of having ordered the
mass arrest of residents in the Latvian village of Audrini and then
burning the town. The 200 villagers were later killed by the Nazis.
Deportation proceedings against Maikovskis began in the United
States in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals.
   Maikovskis had designated Switzerland as the country to which he
wanted to be deported, but that country refused him and he faced
deportation to the Soviet Union.
   In fact, OSI filed papers on Oct. 7 redesignating the Soviet
Union Maikovskis' deportation destination, Sher said, but
Maikovskis was apparently already gone.
   ``He saw the handwriting on the wall,'' Sher said, pointing to
the case of Karl Linnas, who was accused of Nazi collaboration and
was deported last year to the Soviet Union. Linnas, also of Long
Island, died before he could be tried.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush, who
once trailed Michael Dukakis by a wide margin in Minnesota, has
narrowed Dukakis' lead in the state, according to a Northstar Poll
published Friday.
   Dukakis led Bush among likely Minnesota voters 47 percent to 43
percent, according to the poll, published Friday in the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   In May, Bush trailed Dukakis 55 percent to 34 percent in
Minnesota. By mid-September, however, he had narrowed the gap to
seven percentage points.
   Along with Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, Minnesota
has been regarded as among the few safe bets for the Democratic
presidential nominee.
   Minnesota controls ten electoral votes and has been carried by
the Democrats in six of the last seven presidential elections.
   The telephone survey, conducted among 690 likely voters in the
week preceding Thursday night's debate, had a margin of error of
four percentage points.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
decided not to make a decision for now on a petition asking it to
determine that U.S. pollution forms acid rain hurting Canada, the
agency said Friday.
   The petition was filed in April by the six New England states,
New York, New Jersey, Minnesota and four environmental groups. In
addition, the Canadian province of Ontario filed a separate
petition.
   Don Clay, EPA's acting assistant administrator for air
pollution, wrote the states and environmental groups saying, ``It
would be premature to rule on your petition at this time,'' the
agency announced.
   A similar letter was sent to Ontario.
   In the last days of the Carter administration in 1981, EPA
Administrator Douglas Costle wrote Secretary of State Ed Muskie
that sulfur dioxide emissions originating in the United States were
``endangering'' Canada.
   These emissions help form acid rain, which environmentalists say
is killing aquatic life in lakes in sensitive watersheds of the
Northeast, the Upper Midwest and in eastern Canada.
   The Reagan administration did nothing about the letter, though
the states, environmental groups and Canada argued that it
triggered an obligation under the Clean Air Act for EPA to force
states to rewrite their air pollution control plans to reduce the
emissions harming Canada.
   A federal appeals court ruled against the states, holding that
Costle's letter was not a formal enough finding of harm to Canada
to trigger a requirement forcing states to act. Such a finding must
be arrived at through regulations requiring notice to all parties
involved and a chance to comment, and the states could request such
a proceeding, the court said.
   Some of the states in July lost a separate but related suit
claiming that sulfur dioxide originating in power plant and
industrial smokestacks of the Midwest made it impossible for them
to meet federal clean air standards in their own territories.
   ``I do not believe that EPA presently has sufficient information
to undertake the regulatory program required (if the petition were
granted), including the endangerment finding requested in your
petition,'' Clay wrote.
   Clay said his letter ``does not necessarily reflect the position
of the administrator,'' but ``I cannot recommend that the
administrator take the discretionary action of making the
findings.''
   In New York City, David Wooley, assistant state attorney
general, said Clay's assertion of insufficient information was
``pure rubbish.''
   Wooley said the letter appears to be formal enough to be the
basis of another lawsuit, ``And that's what I'm going to recommend
to the nine states,'' Wooley said.

<HEAD>Copies Of `Spycatcher' To Be Imported From Australia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publishers of ``Spycatcher'' said Friday they
will not print the book in Britain despite a court ruling allowing
British newspapers publish extracts. Instead copies will be
imported from Australia.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government fought a long
legal battle to ban the book by former intelligence agent Peter
Wright, claiming he had violated his oath of secrecy.
   William Heinemann Ltd., the book's publishers, said British
booksellers have ordered more than 70,000 copies of ``Spycatcher''
printed by its sister company in Australia. Last June Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservative Party government lost its court bid in
Australia to ban the book there. Wright, 73, now lives in Australia.
   If the book were printed in Britain, the government might take
court action to seize the profits, the company said.
   ``It would be quixotic of us to rush out and incur another
injunction,'' said Helen Fraser, spokeswoman for William Heinemann
Ltd. ``The government has shown every sign of never being weary of
legal action.''
   Tim Godfray, director of the Booksellers Association, said
Friday: ``After consulting lawyers we have been advised that
booksellers can sell any edition of ``Spycatcher,'' provided it was
originally purchased or invoiced abroad, and imported by them.''
   London's Daily Telegraph said Friday the government was
considering new moves in its three-year struggle to suppress
Wright's book. It said government lawyers think the copyright for
the book may rest with the government because of Wright's
descriptions of the MI5 counter-intelligence agency.
   On Thursday the Law Lords, the nation's highest court, lifted
orders that had barred three London newspapers _ The Guardian, The
Observer and The Sunday Times _ from publishing extracts from
``Spycatcher.''
   British newspapers called the ruling a triumph for freedom of
the press, but the government claimed a moral victory because the
five judges also said Wright violated the secrecy oath he took as
an intelligence officer.
   Miss Fraser said William Heinemann originally intended to print
200,000 copies of the book in Britain. But now she said
distributors in the Netherlands and West Germany were sending
directly to British booksellers 33,000 paperback copies of
``Spycatcher'' printed in Australia and have taken orders for at
least 40,000 more copies.
   ``No bookshop is now in contempt of court because there are no
court proceedings pending,'' Miss Fraser said. ``The whole thing is
finished.''
   She added William Heinemann Ltd. of Britain will play no part in
the importation or distribution of the book in Britain.
   To take action against the imported copies the government
``would have to go against Heinemann Australia and that is a
jurisdiction where they have lost and lost and lost,'' she said.

   Mayor Henry Cisneros acknowledged
Friday a close, personal relationship with a woman outside his
marriage after a newspaper wrote about it.
   Cisneros, a popular Hispanic leader once considered a potential
Democratic vice presidential candidate, said he will try to serve
the remainder of his fourth term until May with dignity.
   Cisneros, 41, recently acknowledged problems in his 19-year
marriage. He said Friday he wants to work out his problems to
protect his wife, Mary Alice, and his teen-age daughters and young
son.
   The mayor, who has announced he won't seek a fifth term next
year or run for state office in 1990, talked to reporters outside
his home after reading a newspaper article detailing his
relationship with Linda Medlar, 39.
   Mrs. Medlar, who has helped the mayor in various fund-raising
campaigns, was quoted in a front-page column in Friday's San
Antonio Express-News as saying she loved the mayor. She is married
to the co-owner of a jewelry store.
   ``He's the love of my life,'' she said. ``I've never before met
such a charming, talented man. Our rapport is marvelous and we hope
to be able to live out the rest of our lives together.''
   Mrs. Medlar could not be reached Friday. There was no answer at
her office, and her home telephone number is unpublished.
   The mayor declined to elaborate on his relationship with Mrs.
Medlar, but said it was not the major problem between him and his
wife.
   Mrs. Cisneros, who declined to speak with reporters Friday, has
said she still loves her husband and will not immediately seek a
divorce.
   ``This is a discussion that has gone on for some period of time.
It is nothing new, but it is painful to see it on the front pages
of the newspaper,'' Cisneros said.
   ``Linda is a very intelligent, bright, attractive person.
Clearly we have been very close,'' he said.
   ``I am saying that I am a human being in addition to being
mayor,'' Cisneros said. ``That I am not perfect and that I have
various kinds of needs of friendship and support.''

<HEAD>Bush Begins Stretch Drive; Dukakis Concedes ``Tough Road''</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

   A confident George Bush launched his stretch drive for the White
House on Friday on the wings of a highly acclaimed debate
performance. Democrat Michael Dukakis vigorously attacked his rival
but conceded, ``The road ahead of us is going to be tough.''
   Bush campaigned in California beneath a large helium balloon
reading ``Say goodnight Mike.'' Party leaders radiated optimism
about his chances for victory while aides warned against
overconfidence in the final three weeks of the race.
   Dukakis, campaigning with running mate Lloyd Bentsen, ripped
into Bush with a vigor unseen in his debate-night performance. He
cited Bush's record on the environment, drugs, taxes and a variety
of other issues and said, ``Think of where we'll be four years from
now if we try to get by on Mr. Bush's diet of old chestnuts, new
baloney and the same old voodoo stew.''
   A presidential preference poll by the Los Angeles Times
immediately following the debate found Bush leading Dukakis 52
percent to 42 percent.
   A CBS News survey echoed two earlier surveys Thursday night that
found Bush had beaten Dukakis in the debate. The CBS survey found
Bush the victor 48-25, and found he was supported for the
presidency by a margin of 54-43.
   A larger sample was examined than just the debate viewers, and
of those who did not watch the debate there was no change in their
support, CBS said. The last CBS poll found the Republican ticket
leading 50 percent to 46 percent.
   Said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, once the vice
president's harshest primary campaign critic: ``It seems to me
George Bush is going to win this election and he's going to win it
by a big margin, particularly in the Electoral College.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, told a television interviewer on NBC,
``If I were working for Michael Dukakis I'd be sending out resumes
this morning.''
   Sen. Dan Quayle, the man who would be vice president, also
touted Bush's performance and took a shot at Dukakis. He said the
Democrat lacked the ``common courtesy'' to say something nice about
Bush when given an invitation to do so by a debate questioner.
   For his part, Bentsen said he thought Dukakis had done well in
the debate, then added the race would be a ``tough fight down to
the end.''
   Bush took the morning off after his debate-night labors, then
sought votes in California. ``I believe that I moved my campaign
forward by what happened last night,'' he said. But he told
reporters, ``There's no overconfidence at all. I can remember how
these polls can change.''
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater said much the same thing, adding,
``These big states are all still very close.''
   Dukakis was up early for a rare joint appearance with former
primary opponent Jesse Jackson.
   He seemed subdued. But later in the day, with running mate
Bentsen at his side, Dukakis attacked Bush as a candidate of
complacency. He also replied in personal terms to the vice
president's campaign-long criticism of Dukakis' record on crime.
   ``Now I didn't learn about crime, as Mr. Bush did, from a Clint
Eastwood movie. I learned about it when my father, a doctor, 77
years old, was gagged, beaten and robbed by a thief looking for
drugs in his office. I learned about it when my brother was struck
down in the prime of life by a hit-and-run driver.''
   Confidant John Sasso said the Massachusetts governor ``scored
with the undecided and swing voters last evening,'' in the second
and final presidential debate of the campaign. ``That's what we
were looking for.''
   Sasso conceded that the Democrat trail in the polls, but he
said, ``It's well within range'' and announced new television
advertisements featuring the candidate talking in his shirtsleeves
about campaign concerns.
   In one ad Dukakis says that as a nation America is ``getting out
of shape. ... Instead of doing the right thing we began doing the
easy thing. And now we're in danger of falling behind. I'm not
going to let that happen.''
   There was little to argue with Dukakis' own post-mortem that the
final 25 days would be tough for him and the Democrats.
   He went into the debate needing a breakthrough to transform the
race in the final three weeks.
   But Republicans were swift to claim victory after a clash in
which Bush repeatedly pinned the liberal label on Dukakis, citing
stances on crime, national defense and arms control as evidence.
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III said Bush ``clearly
won'' the debate.
   He said that Dukakis faced a seemingly impossible task _ to
appear more likable to the voters and at the same time attack Bush.
``So it was a very difficult situation for him, I think. And it
enabled the vice president, pretty much, to keep him on the
defensive for most of the evening.''
   While both campaigns awaited polling information that could show
how the debate influenced the race, the available results pointed
to an advantage for Bush.
   An ABC News survey called the vice president the debate winner,
by 49 percent to 33 percent and the Los Angeles Times poll had it
47 to 26 with the rest unsure. An Associated Press panel of debate
judges also rated Bush the winner, reversing the judgment from the
first debate Sept. 25 when Dukakis was perceived the victor.

<TEXT>
   A top aide to Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis was dragged from a Nuclear Regulatory Commission meeting
Friday after he tried to speak out as commission officials
discussed a reactor in his state.
   Peter Agnes, the governor's chief aide on atomic power issues,
stood up as NRC staff members told the commission the Pilgrim plant
in Plymouth, Mass., was ready to open after a 2{-year shutdown even
though it lacks an approved emergency evacuation plan.
   Agnes, an assistant Massachusetts public safety commissioner who
has been working to help create acceptable evacuation plans for
nearby towns, immediately was approached by several NRC security
guards.
   He was pulled from his row in the audience and dragged from the
hearing room as he yelled that he was tired of hearing
``half-truths.'' He was not arrested, but was barred from the
Rockville, Md., building.
   ``If that's the way they treat people, public safety officials,
then that's a commentary on the fairness on this process,'' Agnes
said after the hearing.
   ``My concern was that we were reaching a decision point and that
the commissioners ought to know that at least one public safety
official from the commonwealth took exception with what they
said,'' he said.
   Dukakis and other state officials have urged the NRC to keep the
670-megawatt reactor shut down until an acceptable emergency
evacuation plan is in place and tested.
   But NRC officials said the management and equipment problems
that triggered the shutdown on April 12, 1986, have been resolved.
They added that evacuation planning, while not completed, is
greatly improved and should not halt the plant's reopening.
   The commission made no immediate ruling. NRC Chairman Lando W.
Zech Jr. said the commission needed time to review testimony
presented earlier in the day.
   Zech said later he did not know Agnes was a Dukakis
administration official. An NRC spokesman said the chairman had
drafted a letter expressing his regrets about the ``unfortunate
incident.''

<HEAD>Opposition Appeals For Transition Talks; Junta Member Will
Negotiate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout with opposition list of demands, plans for

<TEXT>
   Opposition parties appealed Friday for
talks with the military junta on legal changes that would pave the
way for a transition to full democracy. One junta member said he
welcomed some negotiation.
   The 16-party opposition coalition, in its six-page ``Proposal
for a National Consensus,'' also vowed to remain united and to
present a single presidential candidate in next year's elections.
   No opposition candidate has been agreed upon, but most
speculation has centered on Christian Democratic Party president
Patricio Aylwin, who read the proposal at a news conference.
   The document was critical of military President Augusto Pinochet
for taking a hard line since his resounding defeat in an Oct. 5
plebiscite on whether to extend his rule to 1997.
   Gen. Pinochet has insisted there will be no bargaining with the
opposition, and that the constitution will be strictly followed.
   The opposition document said: ``Instead of assuming the
political consequences of his defeat, he (Pinochet) opted to anchor
himself to power and adopt a position of total intransigence.
Pinochet is the obstacle to dialogue and accord among Chileans.''
   It made no specific demand for Pinochet's departure, saying only
that ``he must step aside to facilitate national reconciliation.''
   Under terms of an 8-year-old constitution drafted by Pinochet's
administration, he remains in power until March 1990, when he is to
hand over power to a successor chosen in an open election scheduled
for Dec. 14, 1989.
   The document said the military junta's willingness to negotiate
``will determine, in large part, the success of a consentual path
we believe to be indispensable for Chile.''
   ``The armed forces have an immense responsibility before the
people and the future in this important hour,'' it said. ``It is
their patriotic duty to join in the Chilean people's decision to
make urgent changes that allow an effective transition to
democracy.''
   The four-man junta acts as a legislature in the absence of
congress, disbanded when Pinochet led a 1973 coup and took power.
Junta members include a Pinochet-designated army representative,
Gen. Humberto Gordon; the navy commander, Adm. Jose Merino; the
director of the national police, Gen. Rodolfo Stange; and air force
chief Gen. Fernando Matthei.
   In remarks to foreign reporters, Matthei said Friday that he
would accept negotiations on some constitutional reform.
   ``Yes, yes,'' Matthei said in Enlgish. ``We (junta members) have
discussed it quite often. I myself would welcome some of it.''
   Matthei added, however, that the junta would never accept
changes in the constitution's ``main frame,'' meaning clauses
protecting private property rights and an economy based on free
enterprise.
   The opposition proposal called for several constitutional
changes, saying the amendment procedure as outlined in the
constutution is too restrictive.
   It also demanded a fully elected congress. The constitution
calls for congressional elections at the same time as the 1989
presidential vote, but would reserve at least nine of the Senate's
36 seats for government-designated representatives.
   Other opposition demands include eliminating a clause forbidding
Marxist parties and increasing the number of civilians on the
powerful National Security Council, currently dominated by military
representatives.
   Matthei, speaking at the air force academy, said, ``I would be
very happy to have a change that makes it easier to reform some
things, and harder to reform other things, for example private
property (rights) and the economy.''
   He refused to elaborate.
   Any constitutional reform would have to be approved in a
national referendum, but would be assured of passage if it were
backed by both the right-wing junta and the opposition coalition,
whose parties range from the center-right to the Socialist left.
   Many observers see such a referendum as a tool for reconciling
Chileans divided in the Oct. 5 ballot, in which 55 percent of
voters cast ``no'' ballots on a proposal that Pinochet stay in
power until March 1997.
   Of the vote result, Matthei said: ``We will abide by it. It is
for us mandatory what the people said. They said, `no.' We say,
`all right, no.' ''
   ``We don't want the armed forces involved for a long time or
forever in a military government,'' he said. ``That is bad for the
country and bad for the armed forces.''
   ``Right from the beginning we said, all right, it is easy to
take power. It is not as easy to get graciously out of power,'' he
added.

<TEXT>
   Shifting ice may offer a glimmer of
hope for three gray whales trapped in the ice-clogged waters off
Point Barrow in the Arctic Ocean, a National Marine Fisheries
Service official said Friday.
   The whales have been stranded 18 miles northeast of Barrow by
new ice for more than a week. They are in shallow water only a few
hundred feet offshore. The three _ an adult and two smaller whales
_ have been rising to the surface every four minutes or so to
breath through two 15-by-30-foot breaks in the ice.
   They are five miles from open water.
   Biologists this week said they feared the breathing holes could
freeze over or be slammed shut by shifting ice.
   ``But the sea-ice vectors and sea-ice analysis show there is
some hope,'' said Ron Morris, the fisheries service's field office
supervisor in Anchorage. ``We're not closed in for the winter with
pressure ridges and things haven't gotten to the point where it's
all gloom and doom.
   ``We're not in the position where they are going to go belly up.
They are not that stressed.''
   He said a 96-hour forecast showed a strong potential for ice
movement parallel to the Arctic coast. ``There is the possibility
that this ice will move and open up,'' he said.
   An ice analysis showed that only 70 percent of the ocean in the
whales' immediate vicinity was frozen, he said. Much of the ice is
new, and is 6 to 8 inches thick.
   Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist from the North Slope
Borough, flew over the California gray whales Thursday. He said he
planned to use a snowmobile to reach them late Friday.
   ``We're going to use hydrophones to try to record sounds from
the whales and perhaps use that later on as an attracting device to
get them to open water,'' he said. ``We're coming up with several
different schemes for knocking holes in the ice.''
   One option is the use of explosives to blow holes in the ice;
another involves the use of an ice-breaking Hovercraft at Prudhoe
Bay, some 210 miles southeast of the whales, he said. Efforts to
obtain the services of an icebreaker were unsuccessful by Friday
afternoon.
   ``That's where it stands right now. There's nothing definite,''
he said.
   Carroll said bowhead whales, which grow up to 60 feet long,
would be able to break through the relatively thin ice, and that
the slightly smaller gray whales, at 40-50 feet, might be able to
also if they left their tiny patch of open water.
   ``Bowhead are used to it; they've got more mass; they're bigger
around,'' Carroll said. ``They have their blowhole way up on top of
a big bow on their head. I'm sure these whales could push up
through. There's plenty of mass and strength.
   ``I just don't know if they would apply the force. They've
probably never done it before. They spend their winters in sunny
California. They aren't used to being up here in the arctic ice,''
Carroll said.
   The whales' prospects for survival would be bleak if their
breathing holes closed and they could not force their way to the
surface.
   ``If the ice pushed in and closed the hole they might be able to
hold out for a half-hour or an hour. If they already are exhaused
they are not going to last very long,'' Carroll said.
   The population of endangered California gray whales numbers
about 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5
percent for the past decade.

   Two presidential preference polls conducted
after the final debate between George Bush and Michael Dukakis
found the vice president leading by similar margins.
   A survey of 529 debate viewers by The Los Angeles Times found
the Republican Bush was favored over the Democratic Dukakis, 52
percent to 42 percent. A CBS survey of 442 viewers showed Bush was
preferred by a margin of 54-43.
   Both national surveys had a margin of error of plus or minus
five percentage points.
   A Times survey after the vice presidential debate a week ago
gave Bush a 44-41 lead. A CBS News survey before the debate showed
Bush leading 50 percent to 46 percent.
   The Times survey also found indications that Bush was beginning
to attract voters who consider themselves undecided, said I.A.
Lewis, director of polling for the newspaper.
   The newspaper survey's results Thursday night just after the
debate in Los Angeles suggested that Bush had won the debate, 47
percent to 26 percent, with 27 percent unsure who had won. Friday's
CBS poll said Bush won the debate by a 48 percent to 25 percent
margin.
   ``The bottom line is there isn't very much good news here for
Dukakis,'' said Lewis in a telephone interview.
   ``There are indications that the undecideds are breaking for
Bush,'' Lewis said. ``And there was almost nothing that Bush
supporters were disappointed about in (Bush's performance in) the
debate.''
   ``The undecideds are going two-to-one for Bush, but the numbers
aren't enough to make a full blown prediction about it,'' he said.
   Lewis said Bush pleased his supporters Thursday night in all
areas except his responses on questions about the environment.
   The CBS survey did have some good news for Dukakis. Among debate
watchers, Dukakis' favorable ratings rose to 43 percent after the
debate from 34 percent beforehand. Bush also benefited in that
category, receiving a 58 percent favorable rating after the debate,
compared with 44 percent before.
   Bush's early defense of running mate Dan Quayle may have had
some impact. He was seen as qualified by 41 percent of the viewers,
compared with 32 percent beforehand.
   The CBS survey noted that less than two-thirds of the probable
electorate viewed the debate, meaning the real impact of the debate
on voter preferences won't be known for about a week.
   CBS found its sample by re-interviewing 729 of the 1,009
probable voters interviewed Oct. 8-10 for a CBS-New York Times poll.

   You can call him chairman of the Presidium,
president or Communist Party chief. And now, according to the
official Soviet news agency, you can spell his name
G-o-r-b-a-c-h-e-v, instead of G-o-r-b-a-c-h-y-o-v.
   Tass advised editors receiving its English-language news wire on
Friday that the phonetic spelling of -yov used in Russian surnames
will now be replaced by the graphic spelling, or -ev.
   As examples, it gave Mikhail Gorbachev's name and that of Igor
Rogachev, a deputy foreign minister whose surname used to be
spelled Rogachyov.
   Many news agencies, including The Associated Press, have spelled
the Soviet leader's name that way already.
   Gorbachev was named general secretary of the Communist Party in
March 1985 and on Oct. 1 took on the title of chairman of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the legislature. In governmental
parlance, that made him the president.

<HEAD>Senate Approves 11 Judicial Appointments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted approval Friday of 11 of
President Reagan's judicial appointments, but at least 15 others
have virtually no chance of approval before the chamber adjourns
for the year.
   The voice-vote decision was the latest chapter in a long-running
fight in the 100th Congress, involving the treatment by the
Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee of the nominees picked by
Reagan to move the federal courts in a conservative direction.
   The nominees approved late Friday had been passed by the
committee last week.
   But 15 other judicial nominees have not yet had confirmation
hearings before the committee, and their nominations will die when
the Congress adjourns, which is likely to occur next week.
   The partisan fight over judges reached its zenith last year when
Democrats defeated Reagan's nomination to the Supreme Court of
Robert H. Bork after charges he was too much of a conservative
ideologue.
   In recent months, Senate Republicans have accused Democrats of
stalling Reagan's nominees and GOP legislators responded last month
by using Senate rules to block other legislation.
   Of the 110 judicial nominations made by Reagan in the past two
years, the Judiciary Committee had acted on 95, according to
figures compiled by the panel.
   Approved Friday were Richard L. Voorhees, Gastonia, N.C., for
U.S. district judge for the Western District of North Carolina;
state common pleas Judge Richard L. Nygaard of North East, Pa., for
the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; U.S. District Judge John M.
Duhe Jr., of Lafayette, La., for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals; and Paul V. Gadola, Grand Blanc, Mich., for the Eastern
District of Michigan.
   Also approved were Alex R. Munson, Saipan, for the Northern
Mariana Islands; Norwood C. Tilley, Greensboro, N.C., for the
Middle District of North Carolina; Charles R. Butler Jr., Mobile,
Ala., for the Southern District of Alabama; and Lewis T. Babcok,
Boulder, Colo., for the District of Colorado.
   In addition, others approved were Robert Leon Jordon, Johnston
City, Tenn., for the Eastern District of Tennessee; D. Brooks
Smith, Altoona, Pa., for the Western District of Pennsylvania; and
Jay C. Waldman, Philadelphia, for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania.
   The Senate also approved a number of Justice Department
nominations Friday, including the appointments of both Thomas M.
Boyd and Douglas W. Kmiec to be assistant attorneys general; Stuart
E. Earnest of Oklahoma to be U.S. Marshal for the Western District
of Oklahoma; Richard W. Cameron of California to be U.S. Marshal
for the Southern District of California; and Noreen T. Skagen of
Washington to be U.S. Marshal for the Western District of
Washington state.
   The chamber also endorsed the appointments of Jay B. Stephens to
be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and Dennis C.
Vacco of New York to be U.S. Attorney for the Western District of
New York.

   John Racek is enlisting a herd of cattle
to put some some moo-mentum into his campaign for Congress.
   Racek, a Democratic challenger to Republican Rep. Virginia
Smith, said he will paint ``Racek'' on one side of his cows and
``Congress'' on the other with a purple compound usually used to
mark sheep.
   The cattle then will be let loose in a field near Interstate 80
to graze and advertise, said Pat Racek, the candidate's wife.
   ``They'll stand next to each other'' and deliver the message,
she said. Racek couldn't comment because he was out in the fields
on a combine Friday afternoon.
   The sheep dip won't hurt the animals, she said.
   ``You couldn't use regular paint,'' she said. ``The sheep dip
absorbs into the hair, not in the skin.''
   Mrs. Smith, 77, is running for her eighth term from the huge 3rd
District. After winning a close race in her first campaign, Mrs.
Smith has captured landslide victories, defeating her opponent two
years ago by 77,000 votes.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The daughter of the judge that Bess Myerson is
accused of bribing testified Friday that the former Miss America
became ``very, very angry'' with her for talking to a reporter
about her qualifications for a city job.
   ``She was furious. She was very upset and very angry,'' Sukhreet
Gabel said at Miss Myerson's divorce-fixing trial. ``It was plain
that she was very put out,'' she added.
   Ms. Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, was special assistant
to Miss Myerson in 1983 when she headed the city's Department of
Cultural Affairs.
   Prosecutors claim Miss Myerson gave the $19,000-a-year post to
Ms. Gabel to influence her mother, former state Supreme Court
Justice Hortense Gabel, who was then hearing the divorce case of
Miss Myerson's lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   Miss Myerson, 64, Capasso, 43, and the former judge, 75, are all
charged with a bribery conspiracy in which Ms. Gabel got a job
while her mother slashed Capasso's temporary alimony and child
support payments to his estranged wife, Nancy.
   Ms. Gabel described how her work and personal relationship with
Miss Myerson cooled drastically after an Oct. 18, 1983, newspaper
report noted her mother's involvement in the Capasso divorce. She
said her boss had to write a letter to Mayor Edward I. Koch
claiming there was nothing improper about Ms. Gabel's hiring.
   Ms. Gabel, who had accompanied Miss Myerson to various social
functions, found their contacts limited and her own public
appearances curtailed.
   ``I was told to lay low for a while,'' said Ms. Gabel.
   Ms. Gabel said she began working for Miss Myerson in August 1983
and just a few months later found a telephone message from New York
York Post reporter Richard Johnson on her desk.
   Miss Myerson told her not to return the reporter's call until
after lunch, she testified, and then to do so from Miss Myerson's
office where she and her top assistant, Richard Bruno, could listen
in on extension phones.
   But Ms. Gabel returned from lunch five minutes early and called
the reporter from her own desk, thinking he had some routine
question about the department, she said.
   Instead ``he proceeded to ask me a series of questions and I
answered them'' about her background, education and ``whether I was
friendly with Miss Myerson outside the office.''
   When Miss Myerson passed her desk and realized who she was
talking to, said the witness, ``she didn't say anything but she
looked very, very angry.''
   After she got off the phone with the reporter, said Ms. Gabel,
Miss Myerson summoned her to her private office and questioned her
about what she had said.
   ``She was frowning, her brow was furrowed,'' said Ms. Gabel, but
Miss Myerson did not ask her why she disobeyed orders.
   Shortly after that, the New York Post reported the coincidence
that cultural affairs had hired ``the daughter of the judge who's
handling the divorce of Bess Myerson's boyfriend.''

<TEXT>
   Charges against a man whose blind, diabetic
wife was found lying nude on a bloody mattress with a gangrenous
foot have been upgraded to second-degree manslaughter following the
woman's death, authorities said.
   John Charles Gates, 41, initially had been held on a charge of
criminal neglect, according to Webster County Sheriff Raymond Ray.
   Gates ``was really slow to understand what was going on'' when
he was arrested, Ray said.
   ``Even when we told him his wife had passed on, he was upset,
but still didn't know why he was in jail,'' Ray said.
   Helen Eldora Gates, 45, died Tuesday at Community Methodist
Hospital in Henderson, where doctors had amputated her foot in an
attempt to save her, officials said. Gangrene had blackened her
foot and was spreading past her ankle, Ray said.
   Mrs. Gates also an open wound on her leg which was infested with
maggots, Webster County Attorney Aubrey R. Mooney said in a
telephone interview Thursday from his office in Dixon.
   A neighbor had reported the woman's condition last month after
finding her lying on a mattress in the couple's trailer, Mooney
said. He said the mattress was covered with blood and feces.
   Gates, who worked at a restaurant in Evansville, Ind., had asked
the neighbor to check on his wife, Mooney said.
   Police took Mrs. Gates to the hospital on Sept. 28, Mooney said.
   ``It was pitiful,'' said Harry Durbin, emergency medical
services director for Sebree, who said the woman was nude. ``I've
been (EMS director) for 12 years and that was the worst thing I
ever saw.''
   Durbin said neighbors told him Gates did not sleep in the
trailer with his ailing wife, but instead slept outside, under the
trailer.
   Gates had worked at the Evansville fast-food restaurant for less
than a month and did maintenance work and some cooking, said Teresa
Jones, one of the managers.
   ``We had to tell him how to do things over and over again,'' she
said. ``He really didn't comprehend some things.''
   Commonwealth Attorney Tommy Chandler changed the neglect charge
Wednesday to second-degree manslaughter, a felony. A preliminary
hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

   A photographer for The Associated Press on
assignment in Algiers was arrested Friday while taking pictures of
Moslem worshipers and expelled from Algeria.
   Roberto Pfeil, carrying an authorization form for photographers
issued by the Algerian Information Ministry and valid for one day
at a time, said he was seized by men who appeared to be
plainclothes security officers. Pfeil said they put a sack over his
head and took him to a prison.
   After an hour in a cell, Pfeil said, he was taken to a hotel
room to pick up his baggage and photographic equipment and put on
the next plane to Paris.
   Pfeil, based in Frankfurt, West Germany, was sent to Algeria to
cover riots that broke out Oct. 4 over shortages, high food prices
and the government's program of austerity and economic reform.
   Several days of fragile calm have followed a week of unrest.
   Pfeil said he was taking photographs of Moslem prayers in the
street outside a mosque in Algiers' El Biar district when he was
taken into custody.
   He said he was given no official explanation for his expulsion,
except that one security man ``told me I was an enemy of the
country and had to leave.''
   In Algiers, the telephone at the Information Ministry rang
unanswered Friday afternoon. Friday is the Moslem day of prayer and
government offices are usually closed.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 350 Amazon Indians
wearing loincloths and warpaint protested Friday outside a
courthouse where their chief appeared for a hearing on alleged
illegal political activities, a lawyer said.
   Federal Judge Iran Velasco do Nascimento canceled the hearing
because chief Kube-I appeared before the court in a loincloth,
which the judge said was disrespectful, said Kube-I's lawyer, Jose
Carlos Castro.
   Kube-I, chief Paulo Paiakan, both of the Kayapo tribe, and U.S.
anthropologist Darrell Posey of Henderson, Ky., are accused of
breaking Brazil's foreigners law, which bans foreigners from making
political statements or interfering in Brazil's internal affairs.
   During a trip to the United States earlier this year, the three
complained about the white man's encroachment upon Indian lands.
   The trial, which began in late August, has caused a sensation
because it is the first time native Indians have been legally
considered foreigners.
   At the hearing in Belem, 2,140 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro
in the northern Amazon jungle state of Para, Kube-I told the judge
that as chief of his tribe he has never worn a suit and tie and
refused to begin doing so now, Castro said.
   ``The judge then said Kube-I's decision to wear his tribal
clothes to the hearing was disrespectful and said the hearing was
no longer necessary,'' Castro said.
   Outside the courthouse, Castro said, more than 350 Kayapo
Indians in loincloths and green and yellow warpaint danced, chanted
tribal songs and shot arrows into nearby trees as they protested
the hearing. They were surrounded by heavily armed federal police
and more than 1,000 onlookers.
   Castro said he would file a petition to drop charges against the
two Kayapo chiefs on the grounds that they are Brazilian Indians
and cannot be tried as foreigners.
   Brazil's 220,000 Indians, including 5,500 Kayapos, are wards of
the state and do not enjoy the full rights accorded other citizens.
   Posey, however, said in a telephone interview that he wanted to
see the trial continue because ``if it's shelved, it could be
brought against others in our situation.
   ``This is a real aggression against myself, the Indians, the
scientific community in general and we want to see justice done.''
   Posey and the Kayapo chiefs were charged with illegal political
acitivites after they appeared at Florida International University
in Miami to speak about forest conservation.
   Later, the chiefs spoke at the World Bank in Washington, D.C.,
where they criticized the deforestation of the Amazon, erosion,
mercury pollution from gold mining, and hydroelectric projects that
displace Indian tribes.
   The World Bank later suspended funding for the Xingu
hydroelectric project, which will inundate about 18.8 million acres
of mostly Indian land.
   Many Brazilians believe the Kayapo chiefs were responsible for
blocking the project. But Posey said funding already had been
suspended because of financing problems with the government power
company Eletronorte.
   Posey, 41, an anthropologist and biologist, is an outspoken
critic of the government's Indian policy. He has lived in Brazil
since the late 1970s and already has been threatened with expulsion.

   Anxious relatives opened kinfolks'
graves Friday after several families discovered that their loved
ones had been buried with trash in their coffins or with no coffin
at all.
   Some families who hired funeral director Bobby Wilks have found
bottles, newspapers, discarded flower arrangements and bags of hair
in caskets. Some caskets were not protected by vaults that had been
paid for.
   ``One (corpse) had an old metal flower pot on top of his head.
It was like he (Wilks) was mad at them all,'' said gravedigger
Darrell Dowdell.
   Wilks was charged Friday in nearby Springfield with six counts
of obtaining money under false pretenses, authorities said.
Arraignment is scheduled Monday.
   The family of Ollie Carter watched while his grave at Pleasant
Grove United Methodist Church was uncovered, revealing that a
protective vault bought by his survivors was not installed over his
casket.
   They said their case was similar to those described by other
customers of Barber Funeral Home, who say Wilks asked them to leave
the gravesite before the caskets were lowered into the ground and
covered.
   ``Honey would drip out of his mouth,'' said Ann Carter,
daughter-in-law of Ollie Carter. ``He would come over and put his
arm around you and say it would be best if the family didn't see
the casket put in the ground and the dirt thrown on top.''
   At least 14 graves in Robertson and Sumner counties, north of
Nashville, had been opened, authorities said.
   At least two caskets were found buried on their sides, and one
was left open with an arm hanging out, witnesses said. At least 10
caskets contained trash, and one body was uncovered with no casket
at all.
   The Robertson County Health Department issued 23 disinterment
permits by early Friday afternoon and had calls inquiring about
permits, secretary Paulette Cowan said. That does not necessarily
reflect how many graves were being opened; she said a permit is not
required if relatives seek disinterment.
   Wilks, who served as a Robertson County commissioner several
years ago, was admired and respected by the community, Bonnie
Clinard of Springfield said as she watched exhumations in the Cross
Plains Cemetery.
   ``I've known him all my life,'' she said. ``There wasn't nothing
he wouldn't do for nobody. People didn't give him nothing but a
good name. For him to do something like this is crazy.''
   Dowdell, the grave drigger, said Wilks had been burying about 60
people a year in Robertson and Sumner counties for about 20 years.
   Wilks, from Milldale in Robertson County, was first arrested
Oct. 7 after survivors of Danny Pitt told authorities Wilks buried
the body without the $375 vault they purchased to cover the casket.
   Family members became suspicious when Wilks asked them to leave
before Pitt's casket was lowered into a grave. Donald Flatt told
authorities he and other pallbearers left but stayed out of sight
nearby. They said Wilks tossed flower pots into the grave and never
put the vault on the casket.
   Wilks was charged with fraud and attempting to commit a felony,
and was released on bond. His son, Gary Wilks, also was arrested
then and charged with larceny, authorities said.
   Since then, at least 10 more families have filed complaints,
Robertson County Sheriff Bill Norman said.
   Wilks, 52, was arrested again Friday by Robertson County
sheriffs' deputies when he checked out of the Tennessee Christian
Medical Center in Madison, Robertson County Chief Deputy Milton
Frederick.
   ``We had made arrangements to make the arrest when he was
released,'' Frederick said. Center officials refused to discuss why
Wilks was there. Wilks did not reply when asked for comment while
being led away.
   After his arrest Friday, Wilks was held in lieu of $82,500 bond
in Robertson County.
   But if he posts bond, he will quickly be back in custody.
   Sumner County Chief of Detectives George Farmer said Wilks is
charged there with one count of larceny by use of false pretenses,
and that his officers would pick up Wilks as soon as they are
alerted by Robertson County authorities that Wilks has made bond.
   Sheriff's Detective Ed Nicholson said it was possible that more
charges would be filed against Wilks in Robertson County because
more relatives of people he had buried had discussed filing
complaints.

   A man sought by West Germany in a $14 million
fraud case was arrested in San Francisco on Friday by federal
agents and police, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
   The man, identified as Michael Herman Kortmann, 46, was unarmed
and offered no resistance when he was taken into custody in the
city's financial district, the marshals said.
   He was carrying large amounts of money from at least eight
countries, including almost $28,000 in U.S. currency, said Stanley
E. Morris, director of the Marshals Service.
   Kortmann, traveling on a false Brazilian passport under the name
of Robert Herman Sander, had been tracked through eight states
during a four-month search, the marshals said.
   West German authorities said in June, through Interpol, the
international police information agency, that Kortmann is wanted on
charges of defrauding a Cologne firm, Tekronix, of more than $14
million, the marshals said.
   Kortmann was held for an identity hearing in San Francisco
federal court, after which he was to be detained in the San
Francisco city jail for a hearing on possible extradition to West
Germany.

   Federal regulators on Friday pledged $1.3
billion to rescue 11 insolvent savings associations in Texas,
selling them to a cable television company.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the Adam Corporation@Group
of Bryant, Texas, a cable television station operator owned by Don
A. Adam, is investing $65 million now and an additional $15 million
by the end of 1990 to acquire the 11 institutions.
   They are being merged under the name of Olney Savings and Loan
Association. All deposits, even those over the insurance limit of
$100,000, are transferring, the bank board said.
   So far this year, regulators have closed or merged 135 insolvent
S&Ls nationwide, 53 of them in Texas and Oklahoma. Those states
were hard hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986 and a
subsequent break in real estate prices.
   Many of the failures in Texas have been blamed on fraud and the
abuse of the state's regulatory system.
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., said a study to be published next week
by his House Government Operations subcommittee shows that
three-quarters of all S&L insolvencies appear to be linked in
varying degrees to misconduct.
   At the end of June, there were 7,350 pending federal criminal
investigations involving 357 failed institutions and thousands of
open institutions, Barnard said in a statement released by an aide.
   The Adam Corporation transaction is the ninth large rescue
package in Texas since May, bringing total federal assistance to
institutions in the state to $15.3 billion.
   The accelerating pace of S&L closings and forced mergers by the
bank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 thrift institutions,
has spurred new debate in Congress on how to restore the industry
to health.
   The bank board has not acknowledged that it needs more money,
but nearly all private analysts say its insurance fund will have to
be bailed out, very possibly with taxpayer funds. So far, all of
the money used in rescues has come from fees charged the industry.
   Legislation creating a blue-ribbon commission to study the
problem and recommend a solution early next year is expected to
pass Congress before it adjourns next week.
   The government aid in the latest package is coming in the form
of a $303 million, 10-year promissory note and an additional $1
billion in various kinds of guarantees against loss on the failed
institutions' bad loans.
   Regulators said the $1.3 billion was the ``present value'' of
the assistance, meaning that over time more could be paid out by
the government, but it would be worth about that much if it were
paid out all at once.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will have a 20
percent ownership stake in the new Olney. At least 80 percent of
any gains from the bad loans will go to the insurance funds, in
addition to 60 percent of any tax benefits from the deal.
   The 11 institutions being acquired by the Adam Corporation are:
   Olney Savings Association, Olney; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Amarillo; San Angelo Savings Association, San Angelo;
Odessa Savings Association, Odessa; Southwest Savings and Loan
Association, Abilene; Banc Home Savings Association, Midland;
   Southern Savings and Loan Association, Brownwood; Heart O' Texas
Savings Association, San Saba; Shamrock Federal Savings Bank,
Shamrock; Petroplex Savings Association, Midland; and Security
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Pampa.

<HEAD>Iranian Official Says Bush And Dukakis Contacted Iran On Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian official said both
presidential candidates have asked Iran for help securing the
release of hostages held in Lebanon.
   Hussein Sheikholeslam, a deputy foreign minister for Arab and
African affairs, spoke at a news conference late Thursday in Dubai,
the United Arab Emirates, where he stopped en route to Kenya.
   He said Republican candidate George Bush and Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis made contact with Iran through third
parties, including governments and individuals.
   Bush has denied this, and officials in Washington insist the
United States has no direct or indirect contacts with the Iranians.
   Sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is ``a
touchy question'' and that he did not want to get involved ``in the
election games of the United States.''
   But he said the contacts were not at the level of those
conducted in 1986 that led to the Irangate scandal, in which arms
were secretly sold to Iran. He did not elaborate.
   Sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with the
United States should be separated from the issue of the hostages
held in Lebanon.
   Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants are believed to hold most
of the 14 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Nine of the captives are
American.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Sheikholeslam said Iran also was concerned about four Iranians
who have been missing in Lebanon for six years.
   He said that while Iran was appealing for the release of its
nationals, it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the
14 Westerners.
   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who lives in
exile in Paris, said recently that Richard Lawless, a former U.S.
official, negotiated with Iranian government representatives on
behalf of Bush for the release of the American hostages.
   In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
denied again that the U.S. government was negotiating with Iran.
   Fitzwater took issue with a report Friday in The Nation, a
Jerusalem weekly, that talks on the hostages were held but recessed
because of news leaks.
   ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government,'' he
said. ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of people
around the world freelancing on this situation.''
   Fitzwater also predicted more such stories, although he did not
say why.
   ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostly
detrimental,'' he said. ``What they do is build up people's
expectations when they are not warranted.''

   An electrician reportedly distraught
about his job with the city opened fire in his office Friday,
seriously wounding two supervisors before killing himself,
officials said.
   Vladimir ``Walter'' Kozubov, 49, was pronounced dead at the
utility control center, police said. Friday marked his ninth year
on the job.
   One supervisor, Charles Richard Monzingo, 44, was listed in
critical condition. The other, Thomas Edward Darden, 35, was
reported stable. Both were at Stanford Hospital with gunshot wounds.
   ``He immediately shot both of them and then turned the gun on
himself,'' said officer Lacey Burt. ``I don't know the motive at
this time.''
   City electrical assistant Ken Schwab said he and about nine
other workers sat down about 6:50 a.m. to discuss morning
assignments when Kozubov came in with a small caliber handgun and
began firing.
   ``I got under the table as fast as I could as soon as I saw
Walter hit the ground, I got out and called the police,'' Schwab
said.
   Co-workers said Kozubov recently returned to work from a leave
of absence and seemed distraught over job-related situations.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, confronted
by disappointing poll results after his final debate with
Republican rival George Bush, went on the offensive Friday,
denouncing ``Mr. Bush's diet of old chestnuts, new baloney and the
same old voodoo stew.''
   At a rally in front of the California state capitol, Dukakis
invited several thousand partisans to declare him the winner of the
debate.
   ``The Republicans have been up to the plate three times during
this campaign,'' Dukakis told the crowd.
   He went on to contend that the first debate was ``strike one for
Mr. Bush.'' He said that in the vice presidential debate Republican
Dan Quayle ``swung and missed.''
   ``And last night here in California, well, you be the umpire.''
And the crowd responded, ``Strike three.''
   Dukakis said that in the final debate ``we defined what's at
stake in this election. George Bush is satisfied. I know we can do
better. George Bush is complacent. We want to move forward.''
   Dukakis was introduced at the rally by his running mate, Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who asked the crowd, ``Did you watch the debate
last night? Didn't you think Mike Dukakis was wonderful?'' The
partisan crowd roared its agreement.
   Drawing a contrast between where he would take the country and
where Bush would lead it, Dukakis said, ``Think of where we'll be
four years from now if we try to get by on Mr. Bush's diet of old
chestnuts, new baloney and the same old voodoo stew.''
   Dukakis flew later to Seattle, where thousands of people waited
more than an hour in the rain to hear his call for clean air, clean
water, a clean coastline and clean government.''
   The crowd at the Seattle waterfront was one of the largest of
Dukakis' campaign. He addressed them from an open platform as a
steady windblown rain fell.
   Earlier in the day, in Los Angeles, Dukakis appeared much more
subdued when he appealed for support from a group of black
ministers.
   After the Sept. 25 debate, Dukakis opened every speech by
declaring his session with Bush was ``the best 90 minutes of this
campaign.''
   But, this time, quick polls after the debate said people named
Bush the winner by a substantial margin.
   Deputy campaign chairman John Sasso insisted at an early morning
briefing that the poll numbers did not tell the true story.
   ``It was the swing voters we connected with last night,'' he
said.
   ``We're obviously very pleased. ... We felt the governor made a
very compelling case for change,'' he said.
   It was the first time Sasso briefed reporters since his return
to the campaign just before Labor Day.
   Long considered Dukakis' most important political adviser,
Sasso's return to the spotlight appeared to signal the campaign's
realization that it had little time left to get its strongest case
before the voters.
   Sasso had left the campaign after admitting he was responsible
for leaking a videotape that demonstrated that Sen. Joseph Biden of
Delaware, then a Dukakis rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, was using as his own, a political speech of British
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   ``We're poised for a very strong last three weeks of the
campaign,'' said Sasso, who cited recent economic statistics,
including a widening trade deficit and a report of declining
consumer confidence.
   Sasso said that in the debate Dukakis ``connected throughout the
evening in a very personal way.''
   ``Our best messenger is our candidate,'' he said and showed two
new Dukakis commercials in which the candidate delivers his message
in a relaxed, conversational tone.
   In one of the commercials, Dukakis is sitting in shirtsleeves on
a couch and says that despite Republican claims of prosperity ``if
I were a young father today, I'd want to know my government wasn't
blind to the changes in my life.''
   In the other, Dukakis is standing behind a chair and says the
country is falling behind in the competition with other nations.
   ``I'm not going to let that happen,'' he says.
   Dukakis was introduced to the Black Ecumenical Leadership
Breakfast by Jesse Jackson who told the ministers that what was at
risk in the elction was everything ``we've gained the last 25
years.''
   ``There is hope in Michael Dukakis,'' he said and urged them to
work to get out black voters on Nov. 8.
   ``He or she who would be free must strike the first blow,'' he
said.
   He told them to work ``for one who has integrity, intelligence
... not based upon smile, style, profile, but substance, sincerity
and the will to make a difference.''
   Dukakis sounded many of themes he used in the debate, including
citing former federal judge Robert H. Bork as an example of the
sort of appointment Bush would make to fill Supreme Court vacancies.
   He said Bush's use of the case of Willie Horton, a Massachusetts
prisoner on furlough who raped a woman in Maryland, was an effort
to ``divert attention'' from his own ``pathetic'' record on drugs
and crime.
   He called the Horton case ``a terrible human tragedy. I accepted
the responsibility for it.''
   He made passing reference to the style issue: ``There's a new
word in our lexicon, likeability.''

   Republican presidential candidate George
Bush boasted Friday about his debate peformance against Democrat
Michael Dukakis and said, ``I believe that I moved my campaign
forward by what happened last night.''
   Bush and his campaign strategists combined optimism with
cautiousness about Nov. 8 as the race for the White House entered
the home stretch. Just 25 days remained Friday before the election.
   Although polls showed Bush the clear winner in Thurday night's
debate with Dukakis, the vice president's campaign manager, Lee
Atwater, said there was no room for complacency.
   ``This election is going to be won or lost in the last three
weeks,'' he said. ``We're not going to take anything for granted.
...
   ``If the campaign gets smug or overconfident, we're going to be
in trouble in a matter of days. These big states are all still very
close.''
   Plunging back into the campaign, Bush appeared at a rally in the
Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos amid nearly a dozen air balloons
tethered on a high school field.
   He was introduced by California Gov. George Deukmejian as ``the
new heavyweight debate champion of the world.''
   However, in brief exchange with reporters, Bush said: ``There's
no overconfidence at all. I can remember how these polls can
change.''
   Later, Bush delivered an environmental speech in San Diego at
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, with waves of the Pacific
Ocean crashing behind him.
   For the first time, Bush said ``we should take a very close
look'' at environmental concerns before proceeding with ocean
drilling in Southern California in the Santa Monica Bay and
adjacent areas.
   Previously, Bush supported a delay in any drilling in a scenic
tract in Northern California pending study of environmental factors.
   Environmentalists _ a key voter block in this crucial state _
oppose drilling in either site.
   Bush also said that one of his first priorities if elected would
be winning passage of stronger clean-air laws.
   He called air quality ``perhaps the most pressing environmental
concern'' in Southern California, claiming that the areas's recent
growth had not come without a price, ``a price commonly described
with four letters: s-m-o-g.''
   He also promised to convene a global conference on the
environment, claiming that most of the major environmental
problems, including acid rain, warming of the Earth and
deterioration of the oceans, ``are truly international in nature.''
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force 2, Bush was reluctant
to place too much emphasis on a pair of polls that showed Thursday
night's debate increasing his lead over Dukakis.
   ``You're talking to a guy who, when the polls were going the
other way, I said it wasn't over,'' Bush said. ``It wasn't, so why
should I now suddenly have the luxury of changing my position.''
   But when asked how he felt about Thursday's performance, Bush
said, ``Read my smile.''
   In Cerritos, he addressed a crowd of several thousand from a
stage overshadowed by a balloon reading ``Good night, Mike,'' a
not-too-subtle message to the Democratic candidate.
   ``I'm glad that that last debate is over and now we have three
weeks to take our case to the American people in rallies like this
and in events all over this country,'' Bush exclaimed. ``I mean to
run hard, to campaign hard, to stand on the issues and I mean to
win this election on Nov. 8.''
   The vice president said: ``Last night the American people had a
chance to watch two candidates in action. We were specific on the
issues. We came at each other pretty hard. And when the smoke
cleared it was pretty clear where we stood and I believe that I
moved my campaign forward by what happened last night.''
   Brushing aside criticism he was waging a negative race, Bush
said: ``I'm glad we can wage an upbeat campaign about America. I'd
hate to be dragging myself around this country trying to convince
American people that everything is bad. It isn't. A lot of things
are good about our country and this recovery and I want to keep the
expansion going until every man and woman that wants a job has a
job.''

<TEXT>
   Mozambique said Friday its forces
killed 39 guerrillas in battles in the southern Inhambane province.
   An army communique said 33 guerrillas of the Mozambican National
Resistance were killed Thursday while they were en route to a
military training center in Malova on the main north-south road in
the district of Massinga.
   Six guerrillas were killed in a second battle Thursday as they
were moving toward Mapinhane, 125 miles north of the provincial
capital of Inhambane, the communique said.
   In the neighboring province of Manica, rebels sabotaged power
lines Thursday, causing an electricity blackout in the central port
city of Beira, the state news agency AIM reported. The damage was
still being investigated Friday, AIM said.
   The Mozambican National Resistance _ first supported by
Rhodesia, then South Africa _ has been fighting the Marxist
government since 1977. Mozambique has repeatedly charged that South
Africa continues to support the guerrillas despite a 1984 peace
agreement, but Pretoria denies it.

   Time Inc. and a man claiming to be the
sailor kissing a nurse in a famous World War II photograph have
settled a lawsuit the man filed contending Life magazine was
profiting from sales of the picture.
   The photograph, which appeared in the Aug. 27, 1945, issue of
Life magazine, showed a nurse and the sailor kissing passionately
as crowds of people gathered in New York City's Times Square to
celebrate Japan's surrender to the United States.
   George Mendonsa, 64, sued Time, which owns Life magazine, for
$100,000, contending he was the man in the picture and that Life
was profiting by selling copies.
   U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux approved an agreement that
does not include an exchange of money.
   ``Time Inc., was never able to identify the sailor,'' said
Time's attorney Laury Frieber, ``We did not, as the result of the
settlement make any representation as to who the sailor is.''
   As part of the settlement, Mendonsa acknowledges that Time
possesses a valid copyright and may use the photograph as it likes.
   Patrick Hayes Sr., Mendonsa's attorney, said his client was ``85
percent satisfied.''
   ``All that he's getting is that he is being given an opportunity
to get that report in there that says he is the sailor in the
picture,'' Hayes said, referring to a report compiled by a photo
expert Mendonsa hired.
   At least 23 men have told Time they are the sailor in the
photograph, Lagueux wrote.
   ``I know it sounds kind of funny,'' Mendonsa has said, ``but
people like me don't often do something famous, regardless of how
insignificant it seemed at the time. I owe it, in part, to the men
I served with.''

<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers said Friday the
Ramstein air-show disaster and constant military manuevers show
West Germany has relinquished too much of its internal affairs to
its NATO allies.
   ``Those responsible among the NATO partners must understand that
during peacetime, conditions here should not be like those of a
front nation on the eve of war,'' said Walter Kolbow of the Social
Democratic Party during a debate in the West German Parliament.
   The debate centered on concern about West German sovereignty
following a series of NATO warplane crashes earlier this year and
the Aug. 28 accident at the U.S. Ramstein air base that left 69
people dead. Hundreds of people were injured in the Ramstein
tragedy that occurred when three planes in an Italian stunt-flying
team collided and one smashed into the crowd and exploded in flames.
   Many West Germans have complained about property damage caused
by frequent ground maneuvers by U.S. military forces and low-level
flights of NATO planes.
   Media commentators, opposition politicians and others have
called on the federal government to control what the U.S. military
and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations are allowed to
do on West German soil and in the country's skies.
   Kolbow said the Ramstein disaster and deafening low-level NATO
training flights have infuriated the West German population.
   ``In peacetime, that which is meant to be defended and protected
should certainly not be damaged or destroyed,'' he said. ``Concern
_ indeed anger _ is increasing among those affected.''
   NATO military jets flying at treetop levels are a common sight
in West Germany.
   The Social Democrats are demanding the government tell the
United States and other NATO members with warplanes in West Germany
to halt the low-level flights.
   Florian Gerster, another Social Democrat, also spoke of West
German sovereignty.
   ``Americans, Britons and French would not themselves accept such
a burden for very long. The Allies should respect the political
wishes of the German federal lawmakers,'' said Gerster.
   Kolbow demanded ``the federal government and NATO immediately
develop a defense concept that finally makes possible a ban on
military low-level training flights.''
   ``Our view is that an immediate halt to low-level flights is
possible because of the development of modern military technology
and because of the relaxed situation between East and West,'' he
said.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has said low-level flights
are necessary to train pilots, but it is pressing for a reduction
in those flights.
   West Germany is considered one of the most militarized regions
in the world. Almost 250,000 U.S. forces are stationed in the
country.

<HEAD>Italy To Loan Millions For Soviet Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy and the Soviet Union signed an agreement
Friday for Italy to provide the Soviets with a $680 million loan to
help produce consumer goods, the Tass news agency reported.
   It also said an accord was reached that could include Italian
participation in the Soviet space program.
   Scarcity of some basic commodities has been a chronic problem
for years in the Soviet Union.
   A consortium of Italian financial institutions will provide the
government- guaranteed export credit loan so the Soviets can buy
Italian machinery to produce consumer goods, Italian officials said
without elaborating.
   The agreements were reached during a state visit to Moscow by
Italian Premier Ciriaco de Mita.
   Italy and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries
suspended intergovernmental credit concessions to the Soviet Union
after it sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Marxist government battle anti-communist rebels. The Soviet troops
are withdrawing from Afghanistan under a timetable that will have
all of the forces out by early next year.
   Italy is the Soviet Union's third-largest Western trading
partner.
   Tass said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti signed an accord on
cooperation on outer space.
   It did not say if the pact included provisions for an Italian to
join in a flight aboard a Soviet spacecraft, but quoted Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as telling de Mita: ``Maybe some
time in the future an Italian national will keep Soviet cosmonauts
company ... in a joint expedition in orbit.''
   Several foreigners have participated in Soviet space flights,
most recently in August when an Afghan national was in a crew sent
to the space station Mir. The next foreign guest to visit the Mir
station is scheduled to be a Frenchman in a launch set for Nov. 21.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last 2 grafs to CORRECT date and nature of coup, remove

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan will release a report on Monday
regarding the plane crash that killed President Zia ul-Haq two
months ago, the White House said Friday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to discuss the
contents of the report, saying it was up to Pakistani authorities
to reveal the document about the Aug. 17 crash that killed 30
people, including U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel.
   Rumor and speculation have flourished in the absence of any
official report on the case, which is widely assumed to have been
an assassination.
   They range from speculation that a bomb, missile or tampering
with the plane's engines caused the fiery crash. Those blamed in
the reports and rumors have included the Soviet Union,
fundamentalist Moslems, and Afghan and Indian agents.
   U.S. officials have refused to make any disclosures about the
investigation, in which American experts took part, citing the
sensitivity of the case.
   Zia was a military strongman viewed as a bulwark of stability in
the volatile region.
   The Soviet Union objected to his continuing arming and support
of Afghan rebels, accusing Zia of violating the April pact for the
pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It repeatedly warned him
to cease his backing of the guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan
and also aided by the United States.
   Zia, who took power in a bloodless 1977 coup, also faced
opposition at home from Moslems who felt he was too lax in imposing
religious laws on his country and from political groups seeking
free elections.
   Pakistan is committed to holding elections on Nov. 16 for a new
leadership.

   A U.S. Army helicopter made an
emergency landing in Panamanian territory after hitting a bird near
the Panama Canal, officials said Friday. No one was reported
injured.
   Vicky Boatwright, spokeswoman for the Army's press office, said
the UH60 Black Hawk helicopter made the landing at Bique Point in
Veracruz, 15 miles southwest of Panama City on the Pacific coast.
   The helicopter took off again after an hour and twenty minutes,
she said.
   ``The incident is nothing that should be considered important,''
she said.
   The pro-government newspaper Matutino called the landing of a
helicopter in Panamanian territory ``a violation'' of the 1977
canal treaty signed by Former President Jimmy Carter and the late
Gen. Omar Torrijos.

<HEAD>Court: Hospital Can Feed Patient With Tube Over Daughters'
Objections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL STASHENKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state's highest court said Friday
that a woman debilitated by a series of strokes should be fed
despite objections of her daughters who said their mother didn't
wish to be kept alive by artificial means.
   The 5-2 ruling, which reversed decisions by two lower state
courts, gives doctors at the Westchester County Medical Center in
Valhalla the authority to feed Mary O'Connor, 77, through a tube.
   Lawyers for Mrs. O'Connor's two daughters, Helen Hall and Joan
Fleming, had fought attempts to use the tube, arguing that the
woman made it clear she didn't want to be kept alive by artificial
or mechanical means prior to a series of incapacitating strokes
starting in 1985.
   But the majority of Court of Appeals judges said it wasn't clear
what Mrs. O'Connor had in mind when she talked about disliking
life-support systems. They said she may well have meant the
mechanical means used to keep alive people facing terminal
illnesses such as the cancer that killed two of her brothers and
her husband.
   The prospect of dying of starvation or dehydration by
intentionally not getting proper nutrition is something the woman
probably didn't envision, the court said.
   In the absence of proof that ``clearly and convincingly''
indicates what a patient's preferences would be in such cases, the
court said, artificially feeding the woman is the right thing to do.
   Mrs. O'Connor, a former hospital administrator, was said in
court papers to be able to respond to ``simple commands'' and to
``carry on limited conversations.'' However, she is unable to care
for herself and is largely paralyzed.
   Doctors familiar with her case testified that she has also
become mentally incapacitated by her strokes and will ``never
regain sufficient mental ability to care for herself.''
   The medical center proposed using a feeding tube in June when
the woman's gag reflex failed and she lost the ability to eat on
her own. She has been receiving intravenous feeding since her
daughters challenged that move, but doctors said they cannot keep
that method up indefinitely because it doesn't provide sufficient
nutrition and because patients' veins tend to deteriorate over time.
   Wayne Spector, an attorney who helped represent Mrs. O'Connor's
daughters, said the women were ``very disappointed and distraught''
Friday, but would not comment on the substance of the decision
because he hadn't read it.
   Barry Bowman, a spokesman for the Westchester County Medical
Center, applauded the ruling.
   Bowman, who reported that O'Connor was ``awake and alert,'' said
the decision by the court to allow feeding through a tube meant
that ``we can provide more nutrients and it should minimize any
risk of infection.''

<HEAD>Jury Says Women's Group Libeled Man In Assault Accusation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group called Women Against Rape
libeled a man when it circulated a flier that falsely accused him
of assaulting and trying to rape a co-worker, a jury ruled.
   Steve Carney, who was never charged, was awarded $7,500 for pain
and suffering and $25,000 in punitive damages Thursday.
   ``I feel a lot better, but I can't say I really won because
there may be people out there who saw it (the flier) and formed
their own opinions,'' said Carney, 23.
   Carney, of Scotts Valley, sued Women Against Rape of Santa Cruz,
claiming the group publicly humiliated him in a 1984 leaflet that
named him as having assaulted and attempted to rape a co-worker.
   Testimony indicated during the libel trial that the woman never
went to police and swore in a deposition that she didn't know what
happened the night she went out drinking with Carney and another
co-worker.
   Representatives of Women Against Rape testified that they based
their information solely on the woman's word and by observing her
behavior, which they said was consistent with a profile of women
who have been sexually assaulted.
   Women Against Rape directors Deanne Pernell and Jan Shirchild
said they would discuss an appeal with the organization's lawyers.
   ``They (WAR) stated over and over again that the effect of the
publication on Steve Carney was not considered. We found that to be
wanton disregard for his rights,'' said jury foreman Ken Fein.
   Jurors felt that associating someone's name to such a crime
without investigation was ``absolutely ... despicable,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan rebel leader on Friday
said it is impossible to defeat the leftist Sandinista government
militarily, and announced formation of a new group to push for
peaceful alternatives.
   Alfredo Cesar said the new coalition, called the Democratic
Center, will try to persuade other members of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, known as the Contras, that the military solution will
not bring peace to their Central American nation.
   ``The military fight is not viable, what is viable is the
political battle,'' Cesar said at a news conference.
   He said the coalition was formed because right-wing Contra
leaders have have not shown the capacity or imagination to generate
a quick solution to the Nicaraguan conflict. The leftist Sandinista
government has been in power since 1979.
   Cesar said the coalition _ made up of the Nicaraguan
Conservative Party, the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, the
Nicaraguan Democratic Christian Party and the Social Democratic
Party _ plans to present a peace plan within 30 days to the
Sandinistas, other Central American governments involved in the
peace process and the United States.
   ``Once the proposal is accepted, including the release of
political prisoners, the coalition will return to Nicaragua and,
within less than 120 days, reincorporate itself into the Nicaraguan
political process and participate in elections of a Central
American parliament as well as municipal, legislative and
presidential elections,'' Cesar said, reading a statement.
   ``One of our biggest fears is that whatever new U.S.
administration (takes office in 1989) will reach an agreement with
the Sandinistas, and we will be left out of the political
picture,'' said a coalition source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The source also said coalition members perceived guarded
interest in the Sandinista government when they spoke with
government representatives during a meeting at the United Nations.
   Cesar said the new Democratic Center coalition is not breaking
away from the Nicaraguan Resistance, but will try to win other
members over to its ideas.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the San Onofre nuclear power
plant said Friday it found 20 instances of workers using marijuana
and will begin performing random drug tests on its employees.
   The testing plan announced by Southern California Edison Co.
closely matches one under consideration by the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for imposition industrywide.
   At San Onofre _ the first plant in the nation where a reactor
operator was suspended by the NRC because of a positive drug test _
trained dogs found marijuana residue in four spots, Edison said in
a news release. The utility said follow-up sweeps found drugs or
residue in 16 more spots around the plant, which is on the coast
north of San Diego.
   The searches took place after the remains of marijuana
cigarettes turned up in little-used rooms in reactor buildings
where security clearances are required, said NRC spokesman Greg
Cook.
   There was no way to determine if anyone who actually operates
the reactors was high on drugs, he said.
   ``They couldn't identify who brought it on site,'' Cook said.
``There's a heck of a lot of employees who work out there, and a
lot of contractor personnel.''
   Edison released few details of the searches, other than to say
they had been conducted ``in recent weeks.''
   Edison said it didn't believe drug use at the plant had ever
endangered the public. Multiple levels of control and other
safeguards protect plant operations from miscalculations by a
single employee, the company said.
   Edison, which since 1984 has been testing potential hires for
drug use, said that on Nov. 7, it would begin random, unannounced
drug tests of most workers at San Onofre. After one positive test,
an employee will be offered a choice of dismissal or counseling. A
second positive test will result in dismissal.
   The Edison plan is nearly identical to one that will be
considered by the NRC at a public hearing Monday in Maryland, Cook
said. No specific timetable has been set for adoption of the
national plan.
   Under the NRC proposal, an employee who fails a second drug test
would be barred from sensitive areas of nuclear plants for a
minimum of three years and a third positive test would bring
permanent denial of access.
   ``We have good reason to believe that the rate of illegal drug
use among nuclear plant employees is well below the level of the
entire population,'' Cook said. ``I don't think we'll consider it
satisfactorily low until it is zero.''

   Norman Barry, a former judge and state legislator
who played college football at Notre Dame with the legendary George
Gipp before becoming a professional player and coach, has died at
age 88.
   Barry suffered a heart attack in his law office Tuesday and died
Wednesday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
   Barry was coach of the National Football League's Chicago
Cardinals and led them to the league championship in 1925. He won
coach of the year honors.
   Barry was elected to the state Senate in 1942 and served 10
years before becoming a Cook County circuit judge. Barry retired
from the bench in 1978 and returned to private practice.
   Last month he attended the dedication of the Norman Barry
Courtroom at the Notre Dame law school.
   He was the right halfback for Notre Dame from 1919-1921, and
teamed with the legendary George Gipp during two of those years.
   After graduating, Barry played for the Chicago Cardinals and the
Green Bay Packers before being named coach of the Cardinals.
   The Chicago Cardinals became the St. Louis Cardinals in 1960.
   Earlier this year, he received the Distinguished American Award
from the National Football Foundation.
   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Norman; a
daughter, Margaret; seven grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
   Services were set for Monday.

with reckless conduct, said Detective Tom Shine.
   ``They're charged as juveniles. The case will be referred to
Family Court,'' Shine said.

   An air force colonel arrested for his
role in last year's attempted coup was shot and killed early
Saturday while trying to escape from a military prison, it was
announced.
   Military officials said Lt. Col. Francisco Baula died at a
military hospital about nine hours after guards at the suburban
Camp Crame stockade shot him when he refused to halt and ignored
warning shots.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, said Baula was shot and wounded three times.
   Officials at the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Center
said earlier that Baula underwent surgery and was expected to
recover. The stockade commandant later said the renegade officer
succumbed to his wounds.
   ``I was informed that at 9:10 this morning he died of his
wounds,'' Col. Percival Adiong said in a telephone interview. ``We
were hoping that he would survive.''
   Baula was arrested Oct. 3 along with two other military men
sought in connection with the Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino's government.
   The uprising was led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan. Baula was operations officer of the air force's 420th
Supply Wing and directed the takeover of the Villamor air base in
Manila.
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in the
revolt _ the most serious of about six armed attemps to oust Mrs.
Aquino since she took office Feb. 25, 1986.
   Baula fled after the coup attempt and remained at large until he
was arrested with the two other suspects while having lunch at a
restaurant in suburban Pasay City this month.
   Montano said Baula slipped into a ``dark corner'' of the
stockade shortly after midnight and tried to climb over the wall
with a makeshift ladder.
   Guards saw him, ordered him to halt and fired warning shots,
Montano said. They then fired at the colonel and he fell to the
ground, according to Montano.
   ``Our investigation shows that there were no others who tried to
help him,'' Montano said.
   He added that security would be reinforced at the stockade,
located at the headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary.
   Last June mutineers attacked the Camp Crame stockade in an
effort to free former Gov. Orlando Dulay, jailed in connection with
the killings of several volunteers who had worked for Mrs. Aquino
during her 1986 election campaign against President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   The raiders failed to free Dulay but fled with a large number of
weapons.
   Mrs. Aquino became president after Marcos was ousted by a
civilian-military uprising in February 1986.
   At the time of Baula's arrest, the military reported police
found $5,000 in his car and said the money was to be used to
finance a new coup attempt.
   Arrested with Baula were Constabulary Capt. Roque Maranon and
trainee Inocencio Cuyuca.
   They are among nearly 80 military rebels and right-wing
militants reported to have been arrested in recent weeks. Manila
newspapers, citing unidentified intelligence sources, have said
there is a new conspiracy agains the government.
   Still being sought is Honasan. He was jailed last December but
escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay the following April.

<HEAD>Man Awarded $1.2 Million After Vocal Chords Crushed In Police
Choke-Hold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A District of Columbia jury on Friday awarded
$1.2 million to a man whose vocal chords were crushed by a police
choke-hold after he got into a dispute with officers at the scene
of a 1985 traffic accident.
   Townsend W. Janey, 51, an employee of the National Security
Agency, had come to the scene of a May 1985 accident involving his
son, Derek, and berated police for taking too long to arrive.
   He soon found himself in an officer's choke-hold.
   ``I was moving my hand back and forth, trying to get some air in
there, and I felt I was passing out but I don't ever remember
hitting the ground,'' he recalled on Friday.
   Janey was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, but the
case was thrown out by a D.C. judge in June 1985. Three
investigations by the city found that the arrest was groundless,
and excessive force had been used.
   Two officers were disciplined in connection with the incident.
   City officials said the Superior Court jury's award was
excessive and would be appealed.

   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis plunged into the closing days of the presidential race
battling for votes in California after a high-stakes debate that
failed to change the chemistry of a campaign that's been going
Bush's way.
   Indeed, the debate appeared to have helped Bush. An instant ABC
News poll called the vice president the winner, by 49 to 33 percent
and a Los Angeles Times poll gave him the margin, 47 to 26, with
the rest unsure. An Associated Press panel of debate judges also
rated Bush the winner, reversing the judgment from the first debate
Sept. 25 when Dukakis was perceived the victor.
   ``I'm happy with the way it came out,'' a grinning Bush said
Thursday night en route to a post-debate rally. Democrats were
guarded in their assessments and acknowledged that Dukakis did not
land a knockout blow.

   A single mother's determined journey from
welfare to work earned her a trip to the White House to see
President Reagan sign legislation designed to help other women do
the same.
   ``I'm a happy person now that I'm working and I'm not on
welfare,'' said Evelyn Vega, 28, of Stamford, Conn. ``Now that the
government did all this, it could be a chance to help a lot of
women like me.''
   Reagan signed a major welfare overhaul bill Thursday that will
offer education, training and work programs aimed at putting
welfare recipients to work. Ms. Vega, whose trip to Washington was
funded by the United Way, said she considers herself a symbol of
the gains other women can make.

   Advocates of expanded AIDS testing say they
will try again next year to win congressional guarantees of the
confidentiality of medical tests for people who might be suffering
from the disease.
   ``We're going to offer it again next session and we will win,
but we will have lost precious time until then,'' said Rep. Henry
Waxman, D-Calif., one of the chief authors of a package of health
legislation approved Thursday by Congress.
   The bill, which now goes to President Reagan for his expected
signature, includes up to $800 million a year for new AIDS-fighting
programs. Both the House and Senate approved it by voice vote.
Plans to ensure the confidentiality of AIDS tests were dropped from
the bill after objections from conservatives, chiefly Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. With Congress trying to clear its agenda and heading
for a year-end adjournment, Helms had threatened to use Senate
rules to block the measure.

   Swarms of so-called ``killer bees'' will
reach the United States within 1{ years and they appear to be a
more formidable threat than originally expected, scientists report.
   ``It's going to keep coming at us no matter what we do,''
University of Kansas insect ecologist Orley Taylor said at the
American Bee Research Conference.
   Experts predict that the dreaded Africanized bees making their
way north through Mexico will reach the Brownsville area at the
southern tip of Texas in the early spring of 1990, and possibly
reach California four years later. The bees have killed at least
350 people in Central and South America, Jim Tew, director of the
International Beekeeping Program at Ohio State University's
Agricultural Technical Institute, said earlier this year.

   Iran has not stopped and searched a

Iraq, shipping sources say, a sign of easing tensions in the gulf
after eight years of war.
   Iranian warships have continued interrogating vessels by radio,
demanding to know their cargoes and destinations, but even those
symbolic interceptions are now down to one-third of what they were
immediately after the cease-fire took hold, said shipping monitors,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Both countries have reported efforts to reopen ports closed by
the Iran-Iraq war, and Iraq said about a dozen of the 18 vessels
trapped in the the ports of Umm Qasr and Khor al-Zubair since the
start of the war have been able to sail out.

   UNDATED _ A confident George Bush launched his stretch drive for
the White House on Friday on the wings of a highly acclaimed debate
performance. Democrat Michael Dukakis vigorously attacked his rival
but conceded, ``The road ahead of us is going to be tough.''
   Bush campaigned in California beneath a large helium balloon
reading ``Say goodnight Mike.'' Party leaders radiated optimism
about his chances for victory while aides warned against
overconfidence in the final three weeks of the race.
   Dukakis, campaigning with running mate Lloyd Bentsen, ripped
into Bush with a vigor unseen in his debate-night performance.

   Gil, a veteran newsman whose role model was
Edward R. Murrow, still yearns to say something Important, even if
it's just on a local morning talk show that nobody watches.
   Gil has been given a new co-host, Len. Len is on an '80s fast
track, having just moved up to the small East Coast network
affiliate from an independent station in Utah. Len is quick. Len is
funny. Len is Now.
   They make a perfect team _ Len's head is as wooden as Gil's
delivery.
   Paul Dooley as Gil and Griffin Dunne as Len star in the wicked
bit of fun ``Lip Service,'' a one-hour HBO Showcase presentation
premiering tonight, with additional playdates Oct. 20, 23, 26 and
29.
   The film was adapted by Howard Korder (``Boys' Life'') from his
play. The project is the first television venture by the producing
team of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet (``The Untouchables,''
``Glengarry Glen Ross'') and Mike Hausman. It was directed by W.H.
Macy, a stage actor and colleague of Mamet.
   Gil, well aware he's being edged out, monosyllabically fends off
Len's guileless attempts to make him a mentor. Len tries to engage
Gil in discussions of deep subjects such as ``the fame thing'' or
``the career-personal life thing.'' Len goes through the motions of
stabbing his co-anchor in the back _ pitching new ideas to the
producer behind Gil's back, making fun of Gil on the air _ but
seems blithely unaware of the inevitable effect.
   ``The trap would be to make him a very one-dimensional
son-of-a-bitch, (that) he's got an ulterior motive from the very
beginning,'' said Dunne in an interview. ``He's a guy that really
idolizes Gil, he's not a guy who's just out to get his job. He just
thinks the guy is the greatest man in the world, and he's always
loved his work _ even though he doesn't even know his work. He's
just an old guy who's been in the industry for a long time, and he
must have interviewed Nixon, and he must've done all that serious
journalistic stuff, and his (Len's) idea of what the media's
supposed to and Gil's are quite different, but he goes into it so
innocently.
   ``His shallowness, the nice thing you can say about it is it's
sincere. That's what I loved about the part. The guy did crack me
up.''
   ``Lip Service'' is a satire on the TV biz, but its clash of
values could apply to any milieu. Reassuringly, if perhaps not
realistically, Gil triumphs in the end.
   Dunne, who starred mostly recently in ``After Hours'' and
``Who's That Girl?'' is a movie producer as well as an actor. He
and Amy Robinson produced the current ``Running on Empty,'' the
critically praised film starring River Phoenix as the son of '60s
radicals on the run from the FBI.
   Dunne's first production was the 1979 Joan Micklin
Silver-directed ``Chilly Scenes of Winter,'' originally released as
``Head Over Heels.''
   He, Robinson and another underemployed actor friend, Mark
Metcalf, had loved the Ann Beattie book. ``We thought it would make
a great movie. We optioned it and for some reason never doubted
that we'd get it made. Because that's how much we knew about making
movies, we actually thought we'd get it made, that's how much we
knew.''
   Dunne and Robinson produced ``After Hours'' and have a new
project with Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom (``My Life As a
Dog'') starring Holly Hunter (``Broadcast News'').
   Paul Dooley, a veteran of Robert Altman movies, is probably best
known for playing the dad in ``Breaking Away.'' He currently stars
in the CBS sitcom ``Coming of Age.''
   ``He's a hilarious man, as a comedic actor and also as a clown,
I mean like a clown in the true sense,'' said Dunne. ``He knows
everything about juggling. He taught me how to fall up the stairs.
He's knows all that stuff.''

Mary Tyler Moore's new CBS sitcom, premiering later this month,

avoiding a title with ``Mary'' in it. Moore has starred in ``The

years ago. Bob's colleague Stan, star of ``Dog Poetry,'' is alive

   Attempting to forecast the stock market on the
basis of which candidate is elected and which policies will be
followed may be a futile exercise.
   The reason: What the candidates say is not always what they
might do.
   In 1980, Ronald Reagan campaigned against the budget deficits of
Jimmy Carter's administration and promised to reduce and finally
eliminate deficit spending.
   But events didn't follow the script. Whereas Carter's deficits
averaged around $63 billion for four years, Reagan's rose to $175
billion a year for the next eight years.
   In 1978, Carter proposed an increase in the capital gains tax,
but a Congress dominated by his own party cut the tax instead.
Earlier, Richard Nixon had expressed his belief in free markets,
and then instituted a price freeze.
   In short, positions taken in pursuit of power aren't always used
in its exercise. Documentation can be found in the careers of
almost all leaders, including such agents of change as Franklin
Roosevelt and Mikhail Gorbachev.
   But if patterns of recent history have meaning, there is an
indicator that does offer some guidance. That indicator suggests
that no matter who is elected, the stock market isn't inclined to
surge in the following year.
   Since 1948, the market has suffered a median loss of 8.2 percent
in the year following a presidential election, the result of
declines in five years and advances in four.
   It doesn't seem to matter which party wins. While Republicans
usually are viewed as pro-business, the stock market doesn't offer
clear substantiation.
   Democratic victories in 1948, 1960 and 1964 led to stock market
advances in the following year. (In 1976, Democratic victory
preceded a decline.) Republican victories in 1952, 1956, 1968, 1972
and 1980 preceded declines in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
   Did such movements have everything to do with politics, very
little, or perhaps nothing at all? Nobody really can say, but what
is certain is that the stock market has its own cycle, one that
doesn't always coincide with politics.
   Securities prices, that is, are as cyclical as the economy. Bull
markets follow and precede bear markets, just as the larger economy
grows and shrinks in a series of recessions and expansions.
   While sometimes the cycles seem to have little relationship to
politics, that doesn't mean there is no cause and effect at all.
   Wright Investors' Service, which supplied these figures,
believes that recent stock market strength may be linked with the
assumption that George Bush will be elected the next president.
   Expectations of Republican victories, it seems, do have a
positive impact on the market. At least the figures show that the
market has risen every year in which the Republicans have won since
1952.
   It's the year after in which the Republicans have done poorly
for the stock market, and that leaves a puzzling question:
   In those post-election years, did the market decline because of
the Republicans? Or had it risen so much in anticipation of a
Republican victory that it really had no other direction to go but
down?

   Robert Sabala takes the vertical drop into
the concrete bowl, then zooms up and down the inside of an adjacent
concrete pipe, his skateboard making wings for his feet.
   ``There's no other feeling,'' he says later, awaiting another
turn at the 20-foot-tall ``Pipeline,'' the primary attraction at a
skateboard park here. ``It's like defying gravity.''
   Skateboarders from California to Massachusetts are finding they
need to defy more than gravity these days to enjoy their sport. In
many cities, they defy the law.
   Communities fed up with skateboarders who dash between cars,
scar concrete and plow down pedestrians increasingly are closing
their streets and sidewalks to the sport.
   In Southern California, sheriff's deputies chase skateboarders
out of the huge Mount Baldy drainage pipe.
   In Washington, D.C., they are shooed from dry fountains in
Freedom Plaza.
   Across the country, skateboarders, also called rippers, brave
trespassing fines to sneak into backyard pools of vacant homes and
drain them for skating.
   ``It's making criminals out of kids,'' says Jason Danziger, 17,
who took up the unicycle when his hometown of Northampton, Mass.,
banned downtown boarding a year ago.
   In April 1987, Palm Beach, Fla., police arrested three
skateboarding teens as they were performing stunts in violation of
the city's 31-year-old anti-skateboarding ordinance. The boys, ages
14, 15, and 16, were handcuffed and taken to the police station,
then later released to their parents.
   ``There is a duty to protect these kids from becoming
paraplegics,'' now retired Assistant Police Chief Richard W. Wade
said at the time.
   In Issaquah, Wash., reckless skateboarders face fines of up to
$250 under a 1985 ordinance.
   To cut down on reckless riders in Rosman, N.C., adlermen in
February passed a law requiring them to have a driver's license or
be supervised by a licensed adult.
   ``They just took over the roads,'' said Lois Terreri, town clerk
of Clinton, N.J., where a skate ban, prompted in part by the
skating death of a 15-year-old boy, carries a $50 fine.
   ``Some of these kids consider themselves fairly skilled,'' she
said. ``Tell that to the little old lady walking down the street
with someone coming barreling at her.''
   All the bad press prompted Santa Cruz Skateboards, among the
largest manufacturers of skateboarding equipment, and Transworld
Skateboarding magazine to give out hundreds of thousands of
bumperstickers with the message: ``Skateboarding is Not a Crime.''
   ``Skateboarding just doesn't receive the social acceptance,''
says Carl West, associate editor of Transworld, based in Escondido,
Calif. ``For a long time, skateboarding was associated with punk
rock. It was more of a statement than a sport.''
   Not so now. A recent revival in interest has made skateboarding
a multimillion dollar industry, with shopping mall fashion shows
and ESPN coverage for competition that earns winners thousands of
dollars and lucrative professional contracts.
   Bob Denike, production manager for Santa Cruz, estimates the
Soquel, Calif.-based company and two large competitors, Vision and
Powell Peralta, pull in $150 million a year between them just for
skate hardware. Boards cost an average of $100.
   ``If you're a young kid, you buy a bike and you buy a
skateboard. It's part of your life,'' he said.
   Since skateboarding evolved in the 1960s, as an alternative to
surfing when the waves were flat, it has developed its own culture.
   Skateboarders have their own vocabulary _ words like lame
(uncool), poser (a kid who pretends to be a good skater, but isn't)
and ollie (a trick that involves popping the board up in the air by
bearing down on the tail.)
   The clothing also is a skateboarder's own _ hightop sneakers;
long, colorful shorts; emblazoned, oversized T-shirts. Shirt
graphics tend toward the bizarre: freaked out rippers with zapped
hairdos and bugged eyes.
   One T-shirt advises: ``Think Fast. Skate Fast. And Don't Look
Back.''
   Skaterboarders say the sport is popular because it allows them
to develop skills at their own pace, without letting down a team,
or even Dad, who probably has never been on a board.
   Avid skaters support three magazines, whose photos show kids
skateboarding on everything from pools to banisters. But all that
free flying can be hard on surfaces _ one reason for anti-skate
sentiment.
   Just a few blocks away from the White House, the Pershing Park
Memorial, dedicated to Americans who served overseas in World War
I, lost a chunk of granite to the boards. The Freedom Plaza
fountains have been scarred and chipped by boards, said Lt. Hugh
Irwin of the U.S. Park Police.
   Riverside, Calif., banned skateboarding in business districts
after skaters turned bus benches into ramps, broke windows, knicked
walls and ``knocked over little old ladies,'' said City
Councilwoman Jean Mansfield.
   Skaters say they've been unfairly stereotyped as bad boys.
``Like bikers,'' says Gabe Roth, 13, who fought the Riverside ban.
   Danziger says it's not uncommon for motorists to shout
profanities at him while he is skateboarding. ``Just like two days
ago someone threw a beer can at me,'' he said.
   Maybe there's some resentment of skateboarders' highly
individualistic ways.
   Take, for example, Steve Alba, 25, of Ontario, a professional
skateboarder for the Santa Cruz Co.
   At the Pipeline in Upland, one of four concrete skate parks in
the nation, Alba is wearing two dangling earrings, one a crystal,
one an evil eye from Mexico. His Converse hightops don't match
either: one is gray, one red.
   Dotting his forehead is a reminder of the 90 stitches needed
after catching his board on the edge of a pool. He plunged to the
bottom, his fiberglass helmet shattering into his forehead.
   Alba, known simply as Salba on the professional circuit, is back
from an illicit skating session at the Mount Baldy pipe, just north
of here. Authorities have flooded the concrete with tar and
surrounded it with barbed wire, trying in vain to deter
skateboarders.
   Sessions at Baldy, and others in backyard pools, have left Alba
with $500 in fines so far this year. But, like a skier, he seeks
untouched territory.
   ``We've got like a little team called Team Virgin to find places
nobody's ever skated before,'' he said.
   Alba was skating a backyard pool the day Stan Hoffman stopped by
to ask what it would take to get local skateboarders out of
backyards and into a skate park. That was the beginning of the
Pipeline, a 2}-acre site, dotted with concrete bowls and anchored
with a 20-by-40 pipe.
   But sometime this fall, Hoffman, 59, and his wife Jeanne, 62,
plan to close the park and rip up the concrete, to be replaced with
an industrial park free from the liability associated with
skateboarders.
   ``I feel bad,'' said Mrs. Hoffman, watching dozens of skaters
zoom around, ``because there isn't any place for these kids.''

   For each impressive skateboard move, there is probably an
equally impressive scar.
   Last year, 91,644 injuries were treated in hospital emergency
rooms as the result of accidents involving skateboards _ about
one-sixth the number caused by bicycle mishaps, according to the
U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission.
   The number rises as the sport's popularity increases, although
industry spokesmen, like Bob Denike of Santa Cruz Skateboards, say
pads and other safety equipment are improving.
   The late Fred Astaire at age 80 reportedly fell and broke his
arm while maneuvering a board to impress his grandchildren.
   INXS drummer Jon Farriss had to cancel the Australian rock
group's European tour this summer after a skateboard spill
aggravated his arthritis.
   Angelo ``Rocky'' Krakoff, who played Sylvester Stallone's son in
the film ``Rocky IV,'' needed surgery for injuries suffered when
hit by a car while skating in Los Angeles.
   ``We've all had our share of accidents, but it's worth it,''
says Brian Kahn, a freckle-faced 14-year-old from Riverside. ``Not
if like your tooth is on the ground and your eyeballs are over
there ... We learn how to fall.''
   Some are less fortunate.
   In Santa Rosa in February, 16-year-old Daniel Vargas fell off
his board as he was traveling to the hospital to see a friend who
had damaged his liver in a skateboard accident. Vargas was in a
coma four days and required brain surgery. ``It was just a struggle
to give him the will to live,'' his mother Connie said.
   In the hospital a month, and rehabilitation another month,
Vargas missed the rest of the school year.
   The August issue of the magazine Transworld contains a eulogy of
sorts for Reece Ramirez, a 16-year-old Sierra Madre boy who was
struck by a vehicle while skateboarding with a friend in January.
When the friend went to get help, Reece apparently was struck a
second time, the account said. He died the next day.
   ``While we are skating and having fun, he will be watching over
us to make sure we don't have another tragic accident such as what
happened to one of my best friends,'' wrote Chris Jurebie.

<HEAD>Portugal to Sink Grounded Ship and 5,400 Cars in Atlantic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portugal will send a new but wrecked
ship and its cargo of 5,400 Japanese cars to the bottom of the
Atlantic, whatever the outrage of ecologists, because ``no
practical alternative is available.''
   That was the comment of Adm. Silva Horta, chairman of the
Portuguese National Council against Marine Pollution, after
returning last week from London, where he reported on the case to
the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping.
   The 58,000-ton Reijin ran aground April 27 in shallow water off
the northern city of Oporto, the first stop on its maiden voyage
from Japan to Ireland. One sailor was killed.
   Emerald Shipholding SA, a Japanese-owned Panamanian company to
which the ship belongs, said July 13 the Reijin was not recoverable
and assumed responsibility for the wreck's removal. The new cars
must be scuttled because they could be unsafe to drive.
   Horta said the company insisted on sinking the ship and its
$100-million cargo at sea and threatened to abandon the wreck if
Portugal refused to cooperate. That would leave the Portuguese with
disposal project costing millions of dollars.
   Environmentalists in Portugal and elsewhere say the 173 tons of
copper and lead, 115 tons of paint, 28 tons of oil and more than
1,000 tons of rubber, plastic and textiles could seriously damage
marine life.
   Salvage workers are dismantling the Reijin's top decks and
ferrying the scrap metal and some cars ashore. The rest of the ship
will be refloated, towed out and sunk in at least 6,000 feet of
water, Horta said in an interview.
   Cars now being unloaded will be dumped 40 miles off the coast,
and the wreck, with the remaining cargo, will be scuttled 150 miles
out by mid-November, the admiral said.
   The Robin Wood Association, an ecology group based in Paris, has
called the decision ``an ecological crime'' and further criticism
has come from the Oslo Convention, which monitors sea pollution.
   Portuguese environmentalists want action from the European
Economic Community, of which Portugal has been a member since Jan.
1, 1986.
   ``It is indeed a crime, dangerous to the whole world, not just
to Portugal,'' Mike Weber, a German lecturer at Oporto's Institute
for Biomedical Science, said in a telephone interview. ``Any
ecology schoolbook will tell you that one liter of oil pollutes one
million liters of water.''
   Marine authorities feel they have no choice.
   If the government tried to salvage the wreck, it not only would
have to pay the estimated cost of $15 million but might also face
claims from Japanese automakers contending that their images were
tarnished by the sale of potentially unsafe cars to bargain-hunters.
   ``We could not take over the task of removing the ship ourselves
because we did not have the technical, financial or even legal
means to do so before the autumn bad weather,'' Horta said.
   Coast guard officials say the first storm of the winter season
probably would destroy the grounded vessel and spread the wreckage
in Portuguese coastal waters. So, the admiral said, ``we consider
the plan to dump at sea the lesser evil.''
   Removal of another ship _ the Tollan, grounded in the Tagus
estuary off Lisbon in 1980 _ cost the government more than $1.4
million and officials want to avoid a far larger bill for the
Reijin.
   Owners are required by Portuguese law to remove wrecks declared
to be dangerous, but Horta said: ``It is, unfortunately, well-known
that this obligation very often cannot be enforced.''
   Shipping companies that operate under the Panamanian flag of
convenience often have little capital other than their vessels.
Horta said the Reijin apparently was the only valuable asset of
Emerald Shipholding.
   Insurers are reluctant to talk about the case, but one based in
Lisbon, speaking privately, said he was ``mystified that such a
modern, well-equipped ship could sink in shallow waters after
making a long, tough voyage from Japan.''
   One theory is that the computerized self-leveling system
overreacted when about 200 cars were unloaded in Oporto and the
crew was unable to adjust it.

   The stockbroker's plea: Once this week is over,
can everybody stop thinking and talking so much about the crash of
1987?
   That may be asking quite a bit. The memory of a $1 trillion
disaster dies hard.
   The recollections will certainly be intense Wednesday, which
marks the first anniversary of Black Monday and that day's record
508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   But after that ritual observance is over, say some of Wall
Street's optimists, maybe a few of the customers will stop looking
backward and start thinking ahead.
   For a year since the debacle, the stock market has been beset by
``fear of the other shoe dropping,'' in the words of Jay Donnaruma,
an analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``The market reacts to bad news but yawns at the pluses. If a
stock isn't a takeover candidate it hardly moves, except when poor
results are announced or predicted.
   ``Cash continues to pile up and mutual funds continue to
experience redemptions.''
   Donnaruma says this atmosphere can be used to build a positive
case for buying stocks. ``It reminds us of 1982, when all the
`smart money' was in money market mutual funds,'' he says.
   Indeed, some market-watchers who have been wary about the
outlook for months have lately moved tentatively toward a more
positive view.
   ``Background conditions have improved,'' analysts at Standard &
Poor's Corp. said in a report, citing both technical market
indicators and recent evidence that economic growth was slowing to
a more moderate pace.
   ``While we don't regard the upside potential as large, the stock
market should be able to work its way higher in the period ahead.''
   But other bears are sticking resolutely to their views, even as
the Dow climbed early this month to its highest levels since the
crash.
   ``Without any new developments, odds are extremely high that the
Federal Reserve will tighten (its credit policy) another notch
within four weeks after the election,'' contends James Stack,
editor of the InvesTech investment advisory service.
   ``The Fed has raised the discount rate within three months
following four of the past six presidential elections.
   ``If they follow suit this time, you'll be surprised at how fast
higher interest rates will send investors scrambling toward the
exits.''
   A good many other observers say the market might well continue
to frustrate both the bulls and bears after the crash anniversary
and the Nov. 8 election are past.
   Anthony Tabell at Delafield, Harvey, Tabell Inc. in Princeton,
N.J., argues that the market is in a ``period of base formation.''
   ``The trouble with finding oneself in the midst of such a
process is that it is usually impossible to tell when that process
is likely to complete itself,'' he says.
   ``There have in the past been base formation periods which have
extended for close to three years,'' he observes. ``The logical
expectation for the market at the moment, then, appears to be more
of the same.''
   Wherever the market is headed, the atmosphere approaching the
first anniversary of the crash contains some stark contrasts with
the mood of a year ago.
   Complaints these days focus more on inaction rather than
volatility, and the amount of ``scared money'' in stocks seems much
less than it was last year.
   On Oct. 14, 1987, as the market was heading for collapse, the
government reported a larger-than-expected trade deficit for the
previous August and the Dow plunged 95 points.
   On Oct. 13 this year, the government again reported a
larger-than-expected August trade deficit. This time the Dow rose 7
points.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Vice President's Role in Major Issues Remains a
Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leaflet distributed in Michigan carries a
bold-face headline: ``Here is George Bush's distinguished record as
43rd vice president of the United States.'' The four pages are
blank _ a campaign gimmick from the state Democratic Party.
   Even some Republicans have wondered about Bush's record. Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, during his futile quest for the GOP
presidential nomination, tried to make the point that although Bush
has a long resume, he's made little impact. Dole cut an
advertisement that showed a man walking through a snow-covered
forest but leaving no footprints.
   ``Where was George?'' the Democrats cried gleefully at their
Atlanta convention, hoping to show that Bush had been out of the
loop, or on the wrong side, when major White House policy decisions
were made. Protesters raise the same where-was-George question with
placards at every Bush campaign stop.
   It is a gambit that arguably has failed. The Democrats _ and
Dole before them _ have not been able to exploit Bush's record to
significant advantage.
   Of course Bush's record, at least as vice president, is Ronald
Reagan's. The president gets the credit or the blame for the past
eight years.
   As Reagan's understudy, Bush got the bit parts and the
supporting roles, accepting the president's assignments but always
relinquishing the spotlight to him.
   It's the curse of the vice president to remain in the shadows.
The office is not a crucible for grand schemes.
   ``Look at past vice presidents and ask, `What did they do?' I
don't think very much,'' says Duke University presidential scholar
James David Barber.
   ``The vice presidency boxes up someone and makes it unlikely
that they can be a public leader in any manner because of the
necessity that they resonate what the president wants,'' Barber
said.
   Leo Ribuffo, a specialist in political history at George
Washington University, said, ``The job is, in a way, a wimpy job.''
   Like Walter Mondale before him, Bush enjoyed exceptional
privileges for a vice president. He had an office in the West Wing,
not far from the Oval Office, and unfettered access to Reagan.
   He attended daily intelligence briefings with the president and
met with him privately once a week over lunch, usually for tacos on
Thursday. The papers that went to Reagan's desk also crossed Bush's.
   The vice president served as a member of the National Security
Council. He headed a crisis management team for Reagan. He attended
Cabinet and sub-Cabinet meetings.
   Yet, his role in each position is largely a mystery.
   Participants at Cabinet meetings say the vice president rarely
spoke and, when he did, only to ask questions.
   Bush and Reagan have refused to disclose the nature of their
discussions or say what advice the vice president offered on any
subject, including the embarrassing Iran-Contra affair that wounded
Reagan's presidency.
   ``There's a lot of secrecy there,'' Barber said. ``The things he
could have done were inside baseball ... but there's no evidence
that he acted as (Secretary of State George) Shultz or
(then-Defense Secretary Caspar) Weinberger'' during the Iran-Contra
affair and told Reagan, ```You're playing the fool, Mr.
President.'''
   A close observer of the inner workings at the White House,
former communications chief Tom Griscom, said Bush ``was kind of a
sounding board'' for Reagan ``and didn't go out and say, `Hey,
guess what I told the president today?'
   ``Reagan called him an executive vice president. He (Reagan)
really turned to him for his advice and counsel and understood that
George was a team player,'' Griscom recalled. ``Ultimately, when
it's all said and done, a vice president is going to give his
input, but it is up to the president to decide what it is he is
going to do.''
   Griscom said, ``I don't think Ronald Reagan and George Bush had
major policy disagreements. I think President Reagan's footprints
have George Bush's footprints alongside them, or inside them.''
   From Reagan himself comes this assessment: ``George played a
major role in everything that we have accomplished in these eight
years.''
   White House aides privately credit Bush with encouraging Reagan
to make overtures to the Soviet Union and to withdraw U.S. Marines
from Beirut after the 1983 bombing that killed 241 American
military personnel.
   They say Bush was a persuasive voice within the administration
for preserving tax breaks for the oil industry. Acting at Reagan's
behest, Bush delivered a warning in El Salvador that helped curb
violence by right-wing death squads.
   R. Gordon Hoxie, president of the Center for the Study of the
Presidency, says Bush ``has quietly done as much or more than any
of his predecessors. I compare him in his foreign policy expertise
with Nixon.''
   Speaking of Bush, Hoxie said, ``People say all he has is a
resume. Well, you can laugh at it, but there it is. It's a resume
in which he did well in all these positions.''
   William Schneider, a political analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, offers a different
view of Bush.
   ``I give him lots of points for loyalty and very few points for
judgment,'' Schneider said.
   ``There is no evidence that he turned the president around on
any issue, and on the one issue where he definitely should have
exercised some judgment _ the Iran-Contra affair _ he did not serve
the president well. He should have been the guy who said, `Mr.
President, this is a terrible idea.' There's no evidence he did
that, which is a major failing.''
   In two areas where Bush played visible roles, the campaigns
against drug trafficking and terrorism, Schneider said, ``There's
not much evidence he did much in either area. There was a lot of
noise and smoke but the results aren't very dramatic.''

   Bush came to the White House with a background as a Texas
oilman, congressman, U.N. ambassador, Republican Party chairman,
envoy to China and CIA director.
   Over eight years, Reagan entrusted Bush with several
high-profile assignments.
   At the Republican National Convention in August, Reagan cited
Bush for two achievements: leading a task force to reduce excessive
government regulations and red tape, and traveling to Europe in
1983 on a mission to persuade NATO leaders to deploy Pershing
missiles.
   The deployment of the Pershings, agreed to during the Carter
administration and executed during the Reagan administration, is
usually regarded as the crucial factor in the series of events that
led to the landmark 1987 agreement between the United States and
Soviet Union to abolish intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   The regulatory task force's recommendations resulted in a sharp
cutback in the growth rate of new regulations and the weakening of
many existing rules, resulting in what the administration says is a
more productive and efficient economy.
   Reagan boasts that the paperwork burden imposed by government on
citizens, businesses and other levels of government has been
reduced by 600 million man-hours a year.
   Overall, the administration estimates the savings in regulatory
costs will total $150 billion by 1993.
   Critics argue that the savings are exaggerated.
   Michael Fix, senior research associate for the Urban Institute,
said the administration overstates the savings by one-third to
one-half, because the panel takes credit for achievements that
belong to others or because regulatory costs sometimes were merely
shifted from one group to another.
   For example, Fix said, the task force claimed consumers saved $3
billion when the government cut in half the 5-mph bumper collision
standard for automobiles.
   Although the material costs for bumpers was lower and fuel
consumption was reduced by using lighter bumpers, Fix said, ``We
contend that consumers paid higher insurance costs as a result.''
   Others charge that Bush's task force also endangered Americans
by weakening or eliminating safety regulations.
   ``In only eight years, George Bush has undermined a system of
health and safety standards that has taken America over 80 years to
achieve,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a
consumer group founded by Ralph Nader.
   Public Citizen charges that Bush's group was responsible for
eliminating or obstructing 20 ``life-saving safety standards.''
Among them was a proposal to relax or rescind the program to reduce
lead in gasoline lead, the chief source of a poison that stunts
mental and physical growth of children and can raise blood pressure
in adults. The proposal eventually was dropped after protests from
the medical community and the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Public Citizen says that ``40,000 deaths and 1 million injuries
can be tied directly to a decision'' by Bush's task force in 1981
to revoke a rule requiring installation of air bags and automatic
safety belts in cars.
   Insurance and consumer groups challenged the revocation in
court. As a result, the standard was reissued in July 1984, to be
fully effective in 1990.
   On another front, Reagan named Bush to lead the battle against
illegal drugs as head of the South Florida Task Force and later the
National Narcotics Border Interdiction System. His mission was to
coordinate the strategies and resources of government agencies
against drug smugglers.
   The administration says the budget for combating drug
trafficking has tripled to $3.5 billion, and Reagan says 4,000 new
drug enforcement agents and prosecutors have been hired.
   In his most optimistic assessment, the president said this year
that ``the tide of the battle has turned and we're beginning to win
the crusade for a drug-free America.'' Yet the same day Reagan made
that statement, his wife, Nancy, declared that ``drugs are tearing
our community apart.''
   Bush's running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, recently
acknowledged he wasn't even aware of Bush's role in the drug fight.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotic Abuse and Control, said, ``I'm not surprised
that Dan Quayle didn't know that George Bush was in charge of
protecting the borders. The American people didn't know, either. It
is no record to be proud of since drugs have tripled coming across
our borders in the time George Bush has been in charge of them.''
   Rangel said Bush had ``requested no additional resources,
offered no creative new ideas and generally, personally was
ineffective on the issue as drugs poured in over the borders and
deaths and overdoses mounted.''
   The vice president also was chief of a task force on terrorism
that in February 1986 recommended the United States refuse to grant
concessions to terrorists.
   At that point, the administration already was involved in
shipping anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Iran in the hope
of winning the release of American hostages. The shipments
continued long after Bush's report was published.
   In the vice president's office, the irreverent motto of his
staff the past eight years has been ``You die, we fly.'' Indeed,
among Bush's official visits to 76 countries have been three trips
to Moscow for the funerals of Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri
Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.
   Bush's staff says that even the funeral trips have deepened the
vice president's experience. He was the first high-level U.S.
official to meet with Mikhail S. Gorbachev before he became the top
Soviet leader.
   ``You can set the tone for your relationship in your first
meeting,'' said Bush press secretary Steve Hart. ``You can bring
back some intelligence. You can go to a funeral, but there's a lot
more that happens. You're generally meeting with the new head of
government.''
   Richard Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail leader, has been
one of Bush's toughest and most persistent critics but he's
softening as Election Day approaches.
   ``In 20 years I haven't said three nice things about George but
I'm trying hard,'' Viguerie said.
   ``I think he's been good for Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``Ronald
Reagan never wanted to implement the conservative agenda, so from
that standpoint he (Bush) was an effective vice president for the
Republican establishment. He advanced the causes of the Eastern,
Republican establishment.''

   In the festive season between Thanksgiving
and Christmas of 1978, two little girls were born within three days
of each other in Hardee Memorial Hospital.
   One girl was an only child. She grew up strong, doing the things
she loved like roller skating and swimming. But another side of her
life was tragic. Her mother died of cancer when she was only 3{,
and five years later, her stepmother left after divorcing her
father.
   The other girl grew up with a faint heart, in and out of
hospitals, unable to run like the rest of the kids, instead turning
to the piano, dressing up and daydreaming of becoming a model. She
had seven sisters and brothers.
   The sick girl, Arlena Twigg, died too young, at age 9, a smile
on her face, fighting valiantly to survive the heart that was
defective.
   Now, a decade after the girls were born, comes a startling
revelation, along with allegations and intrigue that have turned
the lives of their families upside down.
   Arlena Twigg's parents say they learned shortly before her death
two months ago that she was not their daughter by birth. Blood and
genetic testing required for surgery confirmed it.
   They allege the hospital deliberately swapped babies on them,
that their real child is healthy.
   They think they know who she is.
   At issue are the credibility and the motives of the two
families, strangers to each other, the mystery of who the real
Arlena Twigg is, and, on a broader scale, the ethics and morality
of pursuing the search.
   Arlena died without knowing the dark secret. The other girl
lives in a apartment complex in Sarasota, Fla., sheltered from the
turmoil swirling around her and, like Arlena, not knowing she is
suspect.
   Her father lives in fear that someone will walk up to her and
say something. He came outside and talked to an Associated Press
reporter who knocked on his door; he asked that his daughter's name
be withheld.
   Regina and Ernest Twigg have filed a $100 million lawsuit
against the 50-bed hospital, three doctors and a nurse, charging
they negligently and willfully switched their baby with the sick
child and altered Arlena Twigg's medical birth records to cover
their deception.
   If the babies were deliberately switched, what was the motive?
   ``That's a good question. I don't know,'' said the couple's
lawyer, William Post.
   The defendants deny the charges, and one of their attorneys
called the allegations groundless and irresponsible.
   They're all too real for the Twiggs, who moved from Florida to
Langhorne, Pa., near Philadelphia, about a year ago to be closer to
a hospital that specializes in the treatment of cases like Arlena's.
   ``When you lose one that you love as dearly as Arlena,'' said
Mrs. Twigg, her voice breaking into sobs, ``you look at a little
girl and you see one with long dark hair and you grieve. You wonder
about the birth baby and what she would look like. Does she have
reddish blonde hair like one of my other children? Does she have
brownish hair? What's her little personality like?''
   Her obsession led investigators using public records to the
9-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl in Sarasota, who the
Twiggs' attorneys suspect is the real daughter.
   Mrs. Twigg is driven by memories of her own adoption when she
was 9 that separated her from a younger sister she hasn't seen
since.
   The Twiggs lost another daughter, Vivia Grace, who died in 1975
when she was 7 weeks old, also of heart disease and on the same
date Arlena died three years later, Aug. 23.
   ``This little sister I'm talking about, it's like losing the
original baby. We grieve over having lost a child that belonged to
us as I grieved as I grew up,'' Mrs. Twigg said.
   The Twiggs' attorneys are seeking to have the Sarasota girl and
her father genetically tested at the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions in Baltimore where Arlena underwent a battery of 25
tests that showed her not to be their biological daughter.
   The odds that the tests were wrong are 300-million-to-1, said
Phil Kibak, a spokesman for Johns Hopkins.
   ``Why should I?'' asked the father in Sarasota, a 43-year-old
salesman. ``I am positive this is our daughter. I'm not going to
put my daughter through something like this based on suspicion.
   ``She's happy and very well-adjusted. I do not intend to let
anyone interfere in her life. All I'm doing is protecting her from
finding out about this.''
   He said of the Twiggs: ``They need to quit worrying about how
they feel and start thinking about how the child feels.''
   Daniel Callahan, an expert on medical ethics who is director of
the Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., agrees.
   ``I don't think there are any clear-cut rights involved here,''
he said, adding he did not see a ``clear moral obligation'' for the
Sarasota father to have his daughter tested.
   ``At this point, the burden of proof is very much on the others
to show that he isn't the father. ... No one should be asked to
take such a test unless there's awfully good reason to doubt the
situation.''
   Callahan says the case creates a genuine moral dilemma.
   ``If the child is happy with the father, comfortable in this
identity,'' Callahan said, ``for Mrs. Twigg to come in and create
what would be an enormous amount of unhappiness in a lot of lives,
including probably the daughter, she should think very carefully
about the implications.
   ``If she might be the mother, her main obligation is to ask,
`What's going to be best for my daughter?' And what might be best
for her daughter might not be best for the mother.''
   Mrs. Twigg says people have asked them point blank whether they
would take the little girl in Sarasota away.
   ``We have no intentions of wanting to frighten this child. We do
not intend to just run down there and grab her right out of there
kicking and screaming. Is it really fair for her to go through the
rest of her life thinking that her mother is dead? Is it fair to
me? There has to come into the picture some kind of an emotional
balance between ourselves and the ones who she's been living with.''

   Dale Swope, one of the attorneys for the Sarasota father, says
Arlena Twigg was taken to two other hospitals within days of her
discharge from Hardee Memorial for studies of the congenital heart
disease that left her blood starving for oxygen.
   Swope said these were larger hospitals that did not necessarily
have the same precautions for identifying babies, and the risk of a
mistake would be higher in them than at Hardee.
   Further, Mrs. Twigg's credibility has been challenged by
accounts from three people in Florida who were quoted in the
Orlando Sentinel as saying that she told them as far back as 1985
that Arlena's blood type differed from that of her parents and
mentioned the possibility of a baby switch.
   Both Mrs. Twigg and her attorney, Post, said the first
confirmation came when the Twiggs received the genetic test results
from Johns Hopkins.
   But Mrs. Twigg recalled that on the second day in the hospital
when a nurse brought Arlena in, she had a darker complexion and the
mother remarked, ``This doesn't look like the same baby.'' She
quoted the nurse as saying, ``Oh, yes, this is your child. Why
wouldn't it be? She has your band.''
   ``I thought, well, maybe it's a mother's imagination. Maybe it's
me,'' said Mrs. Twigg. ``Then we just totally accepted it and after
that we were not questioning, never at all until May, until we got
the results of the blood test.''
   Post acknowledged that Mrs. Twigg may have discussed the
differences in blood types in 1985, wondering how Arlena's could be
B-positive when the Twiggs had O-type bood.
   ``She was searching for an answer,'' the lawyer said. ``It was
suggested to her, whoever she talked to, that possibly the
medication gave a false reading. She came to believe it was a false
reading. She never went to any testing facility to substantiate the
fact because Arlena didn't need surgery then.''
   Mrs. Twigg told the St. Petersburg Times that she withheld the
information from her husband three years ago because she feared he
might think she had been unfaithful even though she hadn't.
   Her husband said that as far back as last February and March he
still believed erroneously that Arlena's blood type was O-positive,
as her birth certificate showed. Even then, he was lining up donors
among workers at Amtrak in Fort Washington, Pa., where he is a
reservation clerk.
   Exactly when Mrs. Twigg knew of the alleged switch has become a
factor in the Twiggs' malpractice suit.
   Florida law generally imposes a statute of limitations of two
years from the date the wrong is found out. Arguing that that
deadline has passed, some of the defendants have asked that the
suit be dismissed.
   As the case drags on in the courts, fixed in Mrs. Twigg's mind
are her last moments with Arlena just after surgery had restored
the pink to her lips.
   ``Her color was perfect,'' recalled Mrs. Twigg. ``I said,
`Honey, you look so pretty. All those boys up on that floor are
going to be just crazy about you.' She gave me a smile that will be
with me until the day I die.''

<HEAD>Peary: Did He Reach the North Pole or Didn't He</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The controversy over who was first to reach
the North Pole erupted even before Adm. Robert E. Peary returned
from his famous 1909 trek. And the only person who really knows the
answer has been dead for nearly 70 years.
   But that hasn't discouraged periodic waves of speculation, the
most recent touched off last week by Baltimore historian and
astronomer Dennis Rawlins.
   ``He was the finest of the U.S. polar explorers, and he'll also
have the credit of the most successful scientific hoax of this
century. I think that's terrific for one man to pull off,'' Rawlins
said of Peary's expedition.
   According to Rawlins, notes kept by Peary show the explorer
claimed to be the first person to reach the North Pole even though
he knew he hadn't come closer than 121 miles.
   ``My reaction is primarily one of deja vu. This has been going
on now since 1909, and his observations at the pole have been
studied and restudied and analyzed and reanalyzed over and over,''
responded Edward Peary Stafford, grandson of the explorer.
   ``What is implied here is that a man who was an officer in the
armed services of the United States, a commander in the Navy, of
unwavering integrity, suddenly at age 53 changed his spots and
became a crook,'' said Stafford.
   ``I don't think you'll ever convince anybody in the Peary family
that that man was not where he said he was when he said he was
there, and that that point was not the north pole of the Earth,''
he concluded.
   ``My estimate is that we will never know conclusively'' whether
Peary actually stood at the pole or not, said Philip Lundeberg,
curator emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of
American History.
   ``In terms of the history of exploration, these were major feats
of exploration at the time, and they were accepted at the time. ...
My opinion is that these are culturally with us as achievements of
exploration. We can't disprove them in terms of artifacts,''
Lundeberg said.
   Peary wasn't even back from the trip when the first dispute
erupted. Explorer Frederick Cook had reported reaching the pole
ahead of Peary.
   ``I would say there had been considerable doubt raised all the
way back to the original Cook controversy. Various societies, the
National Geographic Society and so forth, bought the Peary
report,'' said Lundeberg.
   Cook's claims were eventually rejected, being termed ``a type of
circumstantial fiction'' by the late arctic explorer Vilhjalmur
Stefansson, but they forced Peary into a battle to defend his own
effort.
   And the resulting confusion found its way to the halls of
Congress and produced lingering doubts that refuse to be put to
rest.
   Even the staid National Geographic Society, an early and fervent
supporter of Peary, published an extensive study in September that
perpetuates the questions.
   ``Whether he actually got to the pole or not, I don't think
should detract from his bravery and spirit and his desire to make a
lasting contribution to the people of this earth,'' said William R.
Anderson, who commanded the Nautilus, the first submarine to sail
beneath the ice at the pole in 1958.
   ``Having dealt with the ice pack to a certain extent ... he had
a very tough undertaking. If he didn't get to the pole it wouldn't
surprise me an awful lot, it really is a tough thing to do with
what he had to do it with,'' said Anderson.
   Ralph Plaisted's 1968 snowmobile trip to the pole would make him
the first person to reach the spot overland if Peary failed to get
there.
   And Plaisted, of Wyoming, Minn., said he has suspected Peary's
claims for years.
   ``You've got to picture this man ... he's got frozen feet, a few
of his toes are missing, and he's 54 years old. The man got up
there, and he knew it was his last trip, and he probably thought,
`Why not?'' Plaisted said.
   ``I don't blame Peary, I blame people like the National
Geographic and The New York Times, who were supposed to investigate
this,'' Plaisted added.
   Will Steger, who reached the North Pole two years ago, is
skeptical, however, of the evidence being used to discredit Peary.
   Steger said he is suspicious of the new reports, but added:
``It's his last crack at the pole, everything's on the line. He's
freezing in an igloo, doesn't have any toes, he's totally
exhausted. Did he really think he was there, or did he make it up?
That, we'll never know.''
   Key to the lingering debate is the fact that Peary's arrival at
the pole _ or his northernmost point if it wasn't the pole _ was
witnessed by four Eskimos and his aide, Matthew Henson, but no one
trained to independently calculate the exact location.
   ``In the cross-examination he was subjected to later, Peary was
criticized for having no man with him who could vouch for his solar
observations confirming the latitude. Peary's answer was that he
wasn't about to share the glory with someone who had not earned the
right to be there as he had _ and there was no one, in his view,''
wrote Barry Lopez in his book ``Arctic Dreams.''
   The notes taken by Peary himself to support his location can be
interpreted in more than one way by professional astronomers and
navigators. Peary, the only person who could fully explain the
notes he kept, died in 1920.
   ``As to whether or not Peary reached the North Pole, the answer,
by nature of the subjective elements within it, can never be
anything more than probability,'' concluded Wally Herbert, an
arctic explorer asked by the National Geographic Society to study
Peary's notes.
   The admiral's diary lacks essential data that a modern
researcher could use to determine the exact location, Hebert
reported, and any one of several possible errors could have led the
explorer in the wrong direction. Indeed, a 10 minute error in his
watch _ which he was unaware of at the time _ might have placed him
18 miles away from the pole, Herbert concluded.
   Herbert concluded that although Peary crisscrossed the area to
make sure he passed over the pole, he could well have missed the
spot by 30 to 60 miles.

   The drought was the last thing North Dakota's
public schools needed. Long renowned for above-average test scores
and graduation rates, the schools are sinking into a worsening
financial crisis that began when oil and farm prices slumped six
years ago. Educators now fear the state's economic woes will speed
the departure of two of its most precious resources: its teachers
and its children.

<TEXT>
   The drought that laid waste millions of
acres of wheat and grazing land across the Midwest now threatens to
create a new victim: North Dakota's already hard-pressed schools.
   Few states are suffering more acutely from the drought than
North Dakota, whose highly regarded schools were already reeling
from a prolonged slump in crop and energy prices. Drought-affected
states like Illinois, Oklahoma and Nebraska have cut or frozen
education spending this year. But North Dakota's current state
appropriation of $346.4 million is fully $42 million less than it
spent on public schools seven years ago.
   ``How serious is the drought for our schools? On a scale of one
to 10, it is about an eight. It's very serious. It wouldn't have
been so serious if we hadn't been struggling for the last six years
with the oil problem,'' said Gov. George Sinner.
   The drought has so far cost this economically depressed state $2
billion, a 10 percent drop in the state's gross product, Sinner
said in an interview. At a time when the push for school reform was
prompting many states to boost spending, Sinner this fall had to
cut school aid 2 percent, or $9 million, the fourth education cut
in North Dakota in as many years.
   The latest cut means state aid dropped by $52 per pupil.
Spending per pupil is $3,481, 31st in the nation. Six years ago,
the state ranked 23rd.
   Teacher salaries average $21,660, 47th in the nation. Six years
ago, they ranked 30th.
   Yet in many ways, the crisis is paradoxical. North Dakotans from
the governor on down tend to regard public schools, for all their
apparent troubles, as a comparative bright spot in the state's
picture.
   The state's 118,000 students generally score well in tests of
basic skills. Ninety percent graduate from high school, the third
best rate in the nation, although educators concede that's at least
partly because school is the only game in town for rural
youngsters, especially in hard times.
   A statewide poll last September by the University of North
Dakota found that 41 percent of respondents think schools have
improved from five years ago; a comparable Gallup poll conducted
nationwide found just 25 percent of respondents felt that way about
their schools.
   Demographically, the schools have much going for them. The state
has fewer single-parent families than the national average. North
Dakotans are ethnically homogeneous. The state has a long, ardent
tradition of support for public education.
   Many here refer glowingly to the ``prairie ethic,'' the
toughness of the early German and Scandinavian settlers who a
century ago turned this harsh land into the nation's leading wheat
producer.
   Yet that very ethic may be making North Dakotans slow to react
to the schools crisis, educators fear. There is practically no
chance for new state taxes this year to bail out schools, said
state senator Bonnie Heinrich, a member of the Legislature's
education finance committee.
   ``The prairie ethic is a double-edged sword because we've got to
change. We can't just ask, how did our ancestors tough it out
before?'' said David Smette, superintendent of the Dickinson school
district, located in the western section of the state hardest hit
by the agricultural and energy slumps.
   The biggest fear is that the drought will hasten the already
pronounced exodus of teachers and young people. North Dakota has
become a favorite recruiting ground for teachers, especially for
districts in Texas, California and Arizona that promise higher
salaries and appealing lifestyles, said Peg Portscheller, president
of the North Dakota Education Association.
   ``Right now the talk (among teachers) of leaving is more than at
any time I've ever heard,'' said James Peters, a guidance counselor
at Dickinson High School.
   Seventy percent of young North Dakotans are leaving the state
after finishing school, said Portscheller. In the most depressed
places like Dickinson, it's worse. A visitor asked 50 high school
seniors at Dickinson High if they would stay in the state. One said
he would.
   ``I don't think there are a lot of job opportunities here,''
said Nicole Fruh, 17, who plans to attend the University of
Minnesota at Morris next year.
   Nancy Johnson, president of Dickinson's board of education,
said, ``I've got a brother in Denver, a brother in Minneapolis, my
sister left for Oregon to look for work, another sister's in New
Jersey, and my folks are in Arizona. I wouldn't be surprised if my
three kids leave someday. That's the story of North Dakota.''
   Leaving the state is ``not necessarily what kids want. But we're
not giving them the opportunity to dream, to explore, to build,''
said Portscheller.
   North Dakota ranks 50th in the number of students enrolled in
advanced placement high school classes. Many schools lack art
programs and offer little or no advanced math or science. Only 19
percent of high school students take a foreign language, compared
with a third of high schoolers nationwide.
   In North Dakota ``reform isn't on the backburner. It isn't even
on the stove,'' said Portscheller.
   ``Most people in this state think schools are OK. But educators
generally agree that we're in a state of crisis. We've put children
on hold,'' she said. ``We do a good job with basic skills ... but
if you look beyond the basics, like problem solving and the ability
to make good decisions, I'm not sure we're cutting the mustard.''
   In Dickinson, where teachers and administrators have already
been laid off, there is talk of eliminating entire programs if the
economy doesn't improve.
   Science labs at Dickinson High are short of specimens,
microscopes and other equipment. The elementary school has no
central library and just one instructional computer.
   The Dickinson district cut $1.2 million from its budget in the
last two years. The current $9.8 million budget includes a $500,000
deficit that will almost certainly lead to more cuts and possibly
layoffs.
   As area oil jobs have disappeared and farm prices have dropped,
land values have declined and school budgets heavily dependent on
property taxes have suffered accordingly. Dickinson's property tax
valuations have dropped from a high of $24 million in 1984 to a
current $17 million. Local real estate agent Robert Karn said homes
that sold for $68,000 four years ago now go for $32,000.
   For many small districts, the drought may prove the last straw
before consolidation _ a dreaded step in isolated towns where
having a school is what keeps them on the map. But many such
districts barely meet minimum standards, according to a report on
North Dakota school problems issued last January.
   State Sen. Heinrich sighed when asked about the future of North
Dakota schools.
   ``There's always hope,'' she said. ``If the feds come up with a
great drought program, if we can get some light industry, if OPEC
lets oil prices go up a bit. And if it would rain.''

<HEAD>China To Freeze Or Cap Prices On Many Goods In Effort To Curb
Inflation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China will freeze or impose ceilings on the
prices of a wide range of goods in an effort to curb rising
inflation, the official Xinhua News Agency reported late Thursday.
   It was the first government indication that it will actually
roll back price reforms, rather than merely halting them as
previously announced.
   ``The situation in the last month shows that the prices of some
commodities haven't yet been reined in,'' Xinhua quoted Cheng
Zhiping, director of the State Administration of Commodity Prices,
as saying.
   He said the government will establish national price ceilings
for important ``means of production'' and freeze the prices of
``daily necessities'' that previously were decontrolled. Xinhua
didn't list the affected items.
   Price ceilings will be set for grain now sold on the free
market, and the prices of chemical fertilizer, pesticides and other
agricultural inputs will be regulated, Xinhua quoted Cheng as
saying.
   Cheng spoke two weeks after the ruling Communist Party ordered a
two-year effort to control inflation officially estimated at about
20 percent but believed to be much higher.
   The party called for steps to end hoarding, profiteering and
loose credit that have fueled inflation, and for a cutback in
industrial growth that has strained the country's weak
infrastructure.
   Premier Li Peng on Tuesday ordered the State Council, China's
cabinet, to put the new austerity policy into effect.

   The nation's merchandise trade deficit surged
to $12.18 billion in August as a record flood of imported products
swamped a continued boom in exports, the government reports.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday the August imbalance was
$2.7 billion higher than the July figure, which had been the lowest
monthly deficit in 3{ years.
   Exports were up $1.03 billion to $27.55 billion as America sold
more cars, capital goods and farm products to foreigners, but
imports rose even faster, surging by $3.73 billion to an all-time
high of $39.72 billion.

   The dollar fell but other markets reacted calmly
to a report that the nation's persistent trade deficit widened in
August.
   One year ago, an unexpected rise in the trade deficit served as
one of the catalysts for the stock market crash.
   The report Thursday confirmed fears that had pushed stocks,
bonds and the dollar down earlier in the week. While the dollar
moved lower, stock and bond markets took the news in stride.

   Billionaire Philip Anschutz has completed a $1.8
billion acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the
nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from Oregon to
Louisiana.
   The railroad, combined with his Denver & Rio Grande Railroad,
puts Anschutz at the head of the nation's fifth-largest rail
company in terms of track mileage. The deal closed Thursday.
   Anschutz reportedly paid $1.02 billion in cash and assumed $760
million of the railroad's debt.

   An investor group led by Hospital
Corporation of America's senior management has made a new,
sweetened offer to buy the hospital chain for more than $3.6
billion.
   The new offer of $51 a share in cash and securities for all of
HCA's 70.6 million outstanding shares came Thursday, a week after a
special committee of the company's board of directors rejected the
group's initial, $47 a share cash offer.
   HCA stock closed at $44.50 a share Thursday, unchanged from
Wednesday's close in New York Stock Exchange trading.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. management, under
attack from an investor group, says it is seeking alliances with
other companies to reverse the losses of its consumer electronics
unit.
   Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and president, on Thursday
urged shareholders not to support a drive by Brookhurst Partners,
which wants to take over half the seats on Zenith's board and sell
the company.
   New York-based Brookhurst has launched its attack on management
through a consent solicitation, which requires the votes of 50
percent of all outstanding shares.

   The acne drug Accutane is as dangerous a
cause of birth defects as thalidomide, causing 40 percent of women
to miscarry and 25 percent to have children with severe birth
defects if taken early in pregnancy, a study reports.
   Thalidomide, a sedative, caused an epidemic of birth defects in
Europe in the late 1950s and early 1960s before it was withdrawn
from the market.
   Since Accutane was approved in the United States in late 1982,
it has been linked to cases of miscarriage or birth defects in 25
states, study author Dr. Edward Lammer of the California Birth
Defects Monitoring Program said Thursday.

   More companies systematically track their
competitors to avoid surprises and identify threats to their own
business operations, according to a study by the Conference Board.
   The business-funded research organization said the study
released Thursday, which covered 315 companies in a range of
industries, showed that monitoring competitors is considered ``very
important'' by 59 percent of top management and 68 percent of
middle management.
   An unspecified majority of these managers believe competitive
intelligence in their companies will expand further in the future,
the Conference Board said in a news release about the study.
   ``The practice of tracking competitors and predicting their
movements is gaining attention and support in many companies,''
Howard Sutton, a Conference Board marketing specialist and study
author, said in the release. ``A major reason is that competitive
intelligence can help shape corporate strategy.''
   The most valuable intelligence concerns pricing, strategy and
sales, and the most useful providers of the information are a
company's own sales people, followed by customers and industry
publications, the study showed.
   It listed these objectives behind most corporate competitive
intelligence efforts: ``avoiding surproses, identifying threats and
opportunities, gaining competitive advantages by decreasing
reaction time, improving planning, and understanding their own
companies better.''
   The study listed several companies by name that conduct
corporate intelligence programs, including American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., Motorola Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Combustion
Engineering Inc.
   It said Motorola hired a former CIA agent to run its
intelligence gathering operation. Others have utilized strategies
that range from telephone hotlines to electronic mail that
accelerates the delivery of competitive information from a sales
force.
   The study also noted that such efforts often confront obvious
legal and ethical issues. It provided this advice to would-be
corporate intelligence professionals: ``If you do not want to see
what you are doing reported in the front-page headlines of your
local newspaper, don't do it.''
   Based in New York, the Conference Board is an extensive
business-research organization funded by companies, trade
organizations and educational institutions in more than 50 nations.

<HEAD>Pharmacies Are Stocked With Upjohn Hair Growth Formula</HEAD>

   Upjohn Co. is targeting physicians with the
initial promotional campaign for its anti-baldness medication
Rogaine, which the company says is now stocked in pharmacies and
ready for sale.
   After Upjohn salesmen tell dermatologists and other doctors
about the minoxidil preparation, a television ad campaign will tell
the public that Rogaine is available, Lawrence C. Hoff, president
and chief operating officer, told a news conference Thursday.
   How many people will consider the benefits worth the nearly
$50-a-month cost of Rogaine treatment is unpredictable, Hoff said.
   Dr. Robert L. Rietschel, associate chairman of the Ochsner
Clinic in New Orleans _ one of 27 minoxidil test sites _ reviewed
research in which Rogaine produced healthy hair regrowth on the
crown of the head, with little effect on frontal baldness, in 40
percent of the men tested.
   The rest experienced no hair growth or only modest results,
although a 40 percent success rate was considered a big gain in an
area where all other remedies have failed.
   Rogain must be applied twice a day, and once use stops new hair
growth is lost.
   Upjohn said men over 49 and those with large areas of baldness
were excluded from its tests because Rogaine was not expected to
work for those groups.
   The company's television advertising will not mention Rogaine by
name, but will announce the availability of minoxidil as a baldness
treatment and urge people to ask their doctors, Hoff said.
   He said pharmacies are stocked with the medication, and Upjohn
salesmen have been promoting the product in visits to doctors since
last week.
   Rogaine already is marketed in 46 other countries. It was
cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for U.S. marketing in
August.
   Upjohn has filed two recent lawsuits as part of an effort to
defend its research and development investment in minoxidil, Hoff
said.
   The suits were filed Wednesday in U.S. district courts in Reno,
Nev., against California Pacific Research, maker of New Generation,
and in Las Vegas against Pantron, maker of Helsinki Formula,
claiming they violate federal prohibitions against false
representation of products.
   Hoff said there was no evidence that polysorbate _ the active
ingredient in both products _ causes hair growth or slows hair loss
as the companies advertise in hour-long television promotions.
   California Pacific Research issued a statement Thursday
defending its claim that New Generation decreases hair loss and in
many cases promotes hair growth. It attributed the lawsuit to
efforts by Upjohn to promote Rogaine.
   A Pantron spokeswoman had no immediate comment.
   Upjohn previously has sued other companies for importing
minoxidil for use as a baldness treatment in violation of Upjohn's
patent. Hoff said it had reached settlements in 14 cases so far.
   Hoff cited Wall Street analysts' estimates for Rogaine sales
varying from $100 million or less to more than $500 million in the
first year, but he declined to offer his own forecast.
   David Bartash, an analyst with the investment firm Dean Witter
Reynolds, said he expected at least $300 million in sales in the
first year.
   Stephen Buermann of Merrill Lynch Research predicted sales of
$700 million to $1 billion after several years.
   Upjohn has priced a 60-milliliter bottle of Rogaine, a month's
supply, at $42.50. Pharmacy chains are advertising prices from $43
to $49 for that amount, Hoff said.
   ``There are certainly a lot of people for whom the prospect of
thicker hair is very enticing, and for whom the $50 a month price
they are going to have to pay for it is perfectly reasonable,''
Bartash said.
   But he said the market is unusual and unpredictable because
sales will result mainly from people asking physicians to prescribe
the drug rather than doctors ordering its use.
   ``There has never been a prescription cosmetic before,'' Bartash
said.

<TEXT>
   The bitter, lengthy and unsuccessful
strikes by 2,300 workers at International Paper Co. mills in three
states were doomed from the start because of the company's
financial strength and its access to an alternative labor supply,
according to some labor experts and analysts.
   ``It seemed quite clear that IP had decided not to crumble'' and
give in to union demands during the 16-month strike, said Charles
Craypo, chairman of the economics department at the University of
Notre Dame.
   Now, he says, ``the paper union is in trouble.''
   The United Paperworkers International Union and the
International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers abruptly called off
strikes against the world's biggest paper company on Monday at
mills in Jay and in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
   Union leaders cited a desire to give strikers an opportunity to
return to the mills, where the average annual salary had been
$37,000 before the strike.
   The end came as the unions faced the prospect of losing its
strike benefits, the paperworkers union faced decertification
elections and support lacked for expansion of the strike to other
IP mills where union members are working without contracts.
   The strike _ over premium pay and work rule concessions _ could
have been successful if all IP locals working without contracts
threatened to walk off the job, said Ben Burdetsky, a professor in
the School of Government and Business Administration at The George
Washington University.
   ``As long as the employer is able to keep running, there is
little impact that a union can have,'' Burdetsky said.
   The strikes affected only the Androscoggin Mill in Jay and mills
in De Pere, Wis., and Lock Haven, Pa. More than 1,000 workers
remain locked out at an IP mill in Mobile, Ala.
   When other locals failed to join the effort, the strikers should
have realized the company could get along without them, Craypo
said. ``From that point on it (the strike) was foolhardy.''
   But even with union support across the country, the strike still
likely would have failed because IP kept its mills running with
hundreds of replacement workers, contends Michael Avakian, general
counsel for the Center on National Labor Policy in North
Springfield, Va.
   ``They should have known in advance that there is a readily
available supply of labor in the market,'' he said. ``When the
unions engage in economic activities, they can't have a blind eye
to the competition for those jobs.''
   The strike's failure was the latest in a string of union defeats
that include the failed 1985-86 meatpackers strike against Geo. A.
Hormel Co.'s flagship plant in Austin, Minn., and the Reagan
administration's firing of thousands of striking air traffic
controllers in 1981.
   Strikes still can be effective, Burdetsky said, but ``if you
can't inflict pain, don't strike.''
   Craypo said that given International Paper's financial strength,
there was little likelihood the strike could have been effective.
   International Paper, with 45,500 employees in 33 states and 15
countries, demonstrated it could easily weather the showdown. The
paper company showed a profit for the first nine months of 1988 of
$548 million, up 94 percent from $282 million in 1987. Revenue rose
21 percent to $7 billion from $5.8 billion.
   Union leaders admit they lost a battle, but say it is just one
small fight in a larger ``corporate war.''
   ``On paper we've lost it, but as the ashes sift down, there'll
be some hot coals there and we will try to fan them,'' said John
Chouinard, a UPIU shop steward in Jay.
   Chouinard blamed the union's national leaders for the
``beating'' the workers took, saying they encouraged the strike but
failed to fully support the effort at the local level.
   ``They pulled the rug out from under us,'' he said.
   Labor consultant Ray Rogers, who was hired by the unions to
conduct a corporate campaign against International Paper, said
strikers can claim victory for showing solidarity within locals and
for making unprecendented contacts with 20 other paperworkers
unions working without contracts at other IP mills.

   High technology translates into high pay for the
industry's top executives, according to a magazine's new survey of
the top 100 salaries in the business.
   The 100 highest paid executives in U.S. high-technology
companies earned an average of $785,000 last year, and 17 were paid
more than $1 million, according to a report this week by Electronic
Business magazine.
   Topping the list is John Sculley, chief executive officer of
Apple Computer, whose 1987 cash compensation was $2.14 million.
   The figures in the survey were compiled largely from proxy
statements. They include salaries and cash bonuses, but do not
include perquisities or stock options, which in many cases equal or
exceed the executives' cash compensation.
   The $785,000 average pay was up 23.5 percent from 1986, when the
top 100 earned an average of $633,000.
   The increase partly reflects a good year for the industry, which
saw sales at the top 200 electronics companies rise 7.4 percent and
profits soar 53.6 percent, said Linda B. Stallmann, senior editor
of the magazine.
   But, she said, the October 1987 stock market crash and changes
in income tax laws also helped drive up cash compensation.
   ``Executives are preferring cash, because sometimes the stock
options aren't as valuable as they used to be, and the new tax laws
have reduced the value of perquisites like houses or cars,''
Stallmann said.
   The magazine also found a sharp increase in the popularity of
contractual guarantees to compensate top executives in the event
their companies are taken over by hostile raiders _ so-called
``golden parachutes.''
   ``Because of all the mergers and acquisitions, the chief
executives are looking for more security,'' Stallmann said.
   The 17 million-dollar earners, as listed in the Oct. 15 issue of
Electronic Business, are: Apple's Sculley, $2.14 million; Unisys
Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal, $1,549,000; Computer Associates
Chairman Charles B. Wang, $1,431,000; Compaq Computer President
Joseph R. Canion, $1,375,000; Seagate Technology President David T.
Mitchell, $1,354,975; Seagate Technology Senior Vice President
Douglas K. Mahon, $1,274,120; Seagate Technology Chairman Alan F.
Shugart, $1,263,951.
   Also, Unisys President Paul G. Stern, $1,195,920;
Hewlett-Packard Chairman John A. Young, $1,193,300; and Computer
Associates President Anthony W. Wang, $1,188,000; Xerox Chairman
David T. Kearns, $1,165,465; Advanced Micro Devices Chairman W.J.
Sanders, $1,057,080; Unisys Vice Chairman Joseph J. Kroger,
$1,029,337; Litton Industries Chairman Fred W. O'Green, $1,022,510;
Honeywell Chairman Edson W. Spenser, $1,014,185; NCR Chairman
Charles E. Exley Jr., $1,001,200; and Convergent Technologies
Chairman Paul C. Ely Jr., $1,000,000.

<HEAD>August Steel Imports Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased steel imports in August boosted
total shipments for the first eight months of 1988 to 14.4 million
tons, up 8.5 percent from the year before, according to the
American Iron and Steel Institute.
   Exports reached 139,000 tons for the highest monthly total since
September 1982.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel, which represents
importers, stated Thursday that when semi-finished imports bound
for U.S. mills are excluded, the eight-month figure shrinks to 12.4
million tons. That represents 17.9 percent of the domestic market,
below the 18.5 percent target of import quotas, the importers'
group said.
   ``Steel imports are being restrained at the very moment domestic
demand and U.S. exports are dramatically expanding,'' said Erwin L.
Klein, president of the importers' group and vice chairman of the
import firm STEELINTER USA Inc.
   ``It is...essential U.S. leaders in government and industry
carefully assess advantages of steel imports in cost-cutting and
shortage relief even though American steelmakers now urge
continuation of quotas,'' Klein said in a prepared statement.
   The quotas are due to expire in September 1989, and it is
uncertain whether the next president will renew them.
   The figures released by both groups were based on Commerce
Department data released Thursday.
   Both organizations reported August imports of 1.78 million tons.
   The importers said the August figure included nearly 185,000
tons of semi-finished steel ordered by American mills as a raw
material for further processing.
   The domestic industry association said the August figure was up
from 1.6 million tons in July and 1.58 million tons in August 1987.

   U.S. automakers posted a 31.5 percent increase in
early October car and truck sales this year compared with the same
period last year, when car makers briefly gave up buyer incentives.
   ``You were heading into the nothingness stage last year, where
all the programs were expiring and inventories were getting down to
a very low level,'' said analyst Charles Brady of the investment
firm Oppenheimer & Co. of New York.
   Now, with inventories at an acceptable 60-day level, ``their
comparison looks phenomenal,'' Brady said.
   During the Oct. 1-10 period this year, U.S. car makers sold
278,932 cars and light trucks, compared with 238,707 vehicles
during the same time last year.
   There were eight selling days in the period this year compared
with nine last year, so percentage changes between the two periods
are based on a daily sales rate.
   The early October period was the first sales period of the 1988
and 1989 model years.
   During August and September last year, automakers offered buyer
incentives, including cash and low-financing rates. Because many of
the incentives expired Sept. 30, some car buyers speeded up their
purchase plans to meet the deadline.
   Incentives, which have become part of car buying in the United
States, are back on some 1989 models and are continuing to pull
consumers to dealers.
   ``We're going in (to the new model year) with some incentives
that aren't all that costly, just attractive enough to keep the
consumers coming into the showroom,'' Brady said. ``You can't
expect too much from this 10-day period.
   ``This is a time to look at cars rather than buy them.''
   Sales of U.S.-made cars rose 36.8 percent in early October of
this year compared to the same period last year, going to 183,652
cars from 151,043.
   Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. said
because of accelerated buying plans last September, it is tough to
spot a year-to-year sales trend.
   But Heaney said some of the big increase can be attributed to
incentives automakers put on some cars shortly after the 1989 model
year began two weeks ago.
   Ford Motor Co. showed the largest increase among U.S.
automakers, with its car sales jumping 70 percent to 58,407 this
year from 38,662 in the same period last year. Light truck sales
for Ford increased 23.1 percent on a daily basis to 33,574 in 1988
from 30,681 the year before.
   General Motors Corp. showed a 31.7 percent rise in daily sales
to 90,183 cars in early October this year from 77,032 cars during
the year-earlier period. GM's light truck sales rose 29.3 percent
in the Oct. 1-10 period this year to 41,010 vehicles from 35,693
last year.
   Chrysler Corp.'s U.S.-made car sales rose 11.8 percent on a
daily basis to 24,566 vehicles in early October, compared with
24,714 cars during the same period last year. Its light trucks
sales went to 19,297 during this year's 10-day period from 19,667
last year _ a 10.4 percent increase in the daily sales rate.

<HEAD>Zenith Responds To Brookhurst Challenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp., the last U.S.-based
maker of televisions, is seeking alliances with other companies to
reverse the losses of its consumer electronics unit and ward off
unfriendly advances from an investor group.
   Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and president, urged
shareholders in an open letter released Thursday not to support a
drive by Brookhurst Partners, which wants to take over half the
seats on Zenith's board and sell the company.
   New York-based Brookhurst Partners, an investor group controlled
by Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L. Ihasz, has launched its attack
on management through a consent solicitation, which requires the
votes of 50 percent of all outstanding shares.
   Brookhurst Partners originally said it wanted Zenith to get out
of its consumer electronics business. Later it said it had found a
possible buyer for Zenith's computer operation. Now it says it
wants to arrange a sale of the entire company.
   Zenith said that with the help of the investment banker Lazard
Freres and Co. it has contacted other consumer electronics
companies and was considering such steps as joint ventures, sharing
of certain electronics designs, licensing Zenith technology and
know-how, and selling other companies' products under the Zenith
label.
   Brookhurst Partners took out full-page newspaper advertisements
on Thursday, asking, ``What's Wrong With Zenith Electronics
Corporation?'' and pointing out the company's persistent losses in
consumer electronics.
   It wants to lower the number of Zenith directors from 10 to six
and have three of its own people named to the board. That would
involve dumping seven current directors, including Pearlman and
Robert B. Hansen, president of the consumer products group.
   Zenith said Brookhurst Partners has been trading Zenith stock in
a way that suggests its only goal is short-term profits. It said
Ihasz worked as a trader in the now-defunct arbitrage firm of
imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky from 1976 to 1980.
   ``They may be experienced in the world of arbitrage and stock
speculation, but we believe they have no experience in any of our
own businesses,'' Zenith spokesman John Taylor said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After several days of large losses, the dollar
inched up against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while stocks
rose slightly.
   Following the announcement Thursday of worse-than-expected U.S.
trade figures for August, the dollar opened in Tokyo at 127.66 yen,
its lowest level since June 22, when it started trading at 126.70
yen.
   After ranging between 127.60 and 128.33 yen, the U.S. currency
closed the week at 128.25 yen, up 0.27 yen from Thursday's finish
of 127.98 yen.
   It was the first time the dollar has gained in Tokyo since
Tuesday, when the currency began its dramatic decline, losing more
than five yen.
   During today's trading the dollar recovered gradually as traders
covered short-dollar positions before the weekend, said a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank said some investors also ``began
buying the dollar for profit-taking, and the dollar gradually
recovered.''
   He said investors also were reluctant to keep selling the dollar
due to fears the central bank might intervene in the market to
support the U.S. currency.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average,
which lost 136.07 points Thursday, gained 33.27 points or 0.12
percent to finish trading at 27,306.57.
   ``Although the stronger yen is considered favorable for the
stock market, the yen rose too rapidly this time and made
participants too cautious,'' said a dealer with Daiwa Securities,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Trading became active as the dollar-yen rate stabilized and
released some of the uncertainty in the market,'' he said.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at a moderate
700 million shares. Among issues attracting participants were
high-tech and finance-related shares.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Moderate Trading, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most currencies in
moderate European trading today in what dealers said was a reaction
to the previous day's aggressive sell-off following news of a
sharply wider U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices were slightly weaker in calm trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's recovery was also
partially due to banks squaring their positions ahead of the
weekend.
   One trader in Rome said market sentiment generally has turned
against the dollar. But another said the dollar was likely to
remain ``fairly stable'' between now and the U.S. presidential
election on Nov. 8 provided there weren't any major news
developments.
   The dollar rebounded in Asian trading earlier in the day.
Traders said the rise was sparked by remarks in Tokyo by U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who said the group of seven
major industrialized nations remained committed to its policy of
currency stability.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.27 yen to a closing 128.25 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted lower at 127.98 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8211 West German marks, up from 1.8193; 1.5405
Swiss francs, up from 1.5390; 6.2170 French francs, up from 6.1995;
2.0505 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0475; 1,358.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,354.00; and 1.2065 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2084.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7435 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7470 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406.30 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $406.50. Both were down from late Thursday's
bid of $406.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.30, down from $406.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.40 to close at a bid $409.82.
   Silver was quoted in London Friday at a bid price of $6.265 a
troy ounce, down from late Thursday's $6.29.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior congressional tax negotiators are
demanding that the federal government seize 540 acres of the
northern Virginia countryside to block construction of a shopping
mall on the spot where Gen. Robert E. Lee led one of the bloodiest
battles of the Civil War.
   The negotiators, who are seeking compromise on competing House
and Senate versions of a catchall tax bill, agreed Thursday night
to include a requirement that the land be annexed into Manassas
National Battlefield Park, 30 miles west of Washington.
   Leaders of the Senate-House conference committee, hoping to wrap
up work on the bill today, also agreed Thursday to provisions:
   _Imposing limited economic sanctions against Iraq in protest of
that nation's use of poison gas against thousands of members of its
Kurdish minority.
   The sanctions would prohibit export of munitions and
high-technology equipment to Iraq and require U.S. representatives
to oppose lending to Iraq by the World Bank and other international
organizations. If the president has evidence at year-end that the
use of chemical weapons is continuing, he would have to impose
tougher sanctions that could include a cutoff of import-export
credit and barring Iraqi imports into the United States.
   _Giving freelance writers, photographers and artists relief from
a part of the 1986 tax-overhaul law. Under the new provision, they
could deduct certain expenses of producing a book, painting or
photographs before the works started generating income.
   _Increasing, to 33.75 cents per mile, the mileage allowance
given rural mail carriers who drive their own cars on their routes.
Most people who use their car in business get only 22.5 cents a
mile.
   _Removing restrictions on the amount of long-term bonds the
Treasury Department may issue at interest rates above 4.25 percent.
   Agreements on the provisions were reached by Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee; Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance
revenue subcommittee; and the senior Republicans on the two
committees, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   The agreements are subject to approval by a majority of the
other negotiators, but aides said they expect no problem.
   The chief purpose of the differing bills is to fix hundreds of
errors and ambiguities in the new tax law enacted in 1986. The
measures have been expanded to carry scores of relatively minor tax
benefits and the tax increases necessary to pay for them. The
Senate version also includes a ``bill of rights'' to help taxpayers
who face enforcement or collections actions by the Internal Revenue
Service.
   ``We made a lot of progress. We are doing very well,'' Baucus
said at the end of Thursday's negotiations.
   Added Rostenkowski: ``We've got $7 billion'' worth of tax
benefits in the House bill and ``the Senate's got $3 billion. It
(the final version) will be some place in the middle.''
   The provision requiring the taking of a portion of the site
where the Second Battle of Manassas was fought in August 1862 was
added to the tax bill only because sponsors saw no other way of
getting it enacted into law this year. The courts would decide how
much owners of the land are paid; the Reagan administration, which
opposes the plan, estimates the cost at $50 million.
   Historians say that is a small price to pay, but the
administration insists the same point could be made by taking only
80 acres at considerably less cost. Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
offered the 80-acre provision to the Senate but lost when Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., on a 50-25 vote, won approval to take the full 540
acres.
   Warner's amendment would have allowed construction of houses and
some commercial development on the remainder of the plot; only a
mall would have been prohibited.
   Sixteen thousand troops were killed or wounded during a 48-hour
fight on the site.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed Friday as
attention turned once again to speculative situations.
   ``We are fairly near the upper levels of the market,'' one
equity salesman said. ``I wouldn't expect institutions to buy at
this stage.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 1.5
points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,829.2 at midday.
   Overall volume was moderate, with 350 million shares changing
hands by midday, compared with 212.5 million shares at the same
time Thursday.
   British inflation figures released just before midday had little
immediate impact on the market because they closely matched
expectations. However, the report confirmed inflation is still a
worry in the British economy, economists said.
   The report showed Britain's retail price index rose 0.5 percent
in September from August and was up 5.9 percent from a year
earlier. Some economists are forecasting inflation will rise to 7
percent early next year before falling back.

   Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 5.9
percent in September from 5.7 percent the previous month, pushed up
partly by higher mortgage rates, the government announced Friday.
   The government has increased interest rates significantly in
recent months to curb inflation, which has risen from an annual
rate of 3.3 percent in January.
   But that action has had the initial effect of boosting the price
index, because of the inclusion of the mortgage rates, which stand
at around 13 percent.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson on Thursday reiterated
``interest rates will have to stay high for quite some time'' in
order to combat inflation, but he said the inflation rate will come
down next year.
   The September rate, which was within the financial markets'
expectations, also was boosted by a wide range of price increases
among other goods and services, particularly clothing, footwear,
household goods and alcoholic drinks, the Department of Employment
said. The price of seasonal foods fell, it said.
   The department's retail price index rose 0.5 percent in
September from August, when the index rose 1.1 percent from the
previous month.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 108.4
in September, up from 107.9 in August, and up from 102.4 September
1987.

   The leader of the American Soybean
Association says he has assured European agricultural officials
this year's U.S. soybean crop suffered little damage from the
drought.
   Ken Bader, the trade group's chief executive officer, said
Thursday he told European officials, including soybean processors,
the drought left only a few beans shriveled and green.
   ``I told them from our estimates this was not a problem any
longer,'' said Bader, ``and at best, only 5 percent of our crop was
impacted.''
   He also said he assured Europeans that the United States will
have soybeans to exportal though the drought reduced the harvest,
and he urged them to end internal subsidies that hurt U.S. sales.
   Bader said the high prices guaranteed to farmers in the European
Economic Community for their oil seeds make it more attractive to
grow those crops than to import U.S. soybeans.
   Bader met with agricultural industry officials at the ASA's
annual European Outlook Conference in London, and discussed the
meeting with reporters in a telephone news conference Thursday.
   ``I reassured them that the short supply in U.S. soybeans
(because of the drought) did not mean an embargo,'' said Bader.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that farmers
will harvest 1.5 billion bushels of soybeans this fall _ down 22
percent from a year ago.
   Bader said the United States continues to press the EEC on its
high internal subsidies to farmers who produce oil seed crops like
sunflowers, rapeseed and soybeans.
   Production of those crops in the EEC has increased 400 percent
since 1981, ASA said, while the volume of U.S. soybean and meal
shipments to its member nations has declined 35 percent. The value
of exports to the EEC dropped from $3.5 billion to $2 billion
between 1982 and 1986, ASA said.
   Bader said the Europeans tried to blame increased production in
South America for the declining U.S. sales.
   ``When their internal oil subsidy scheme is guaranteeing two or
three times the world price ... can we look at South America as the
cause of our problem?'' asked Bader.
   The association official said he stressed that governments still
could help farmers, but they should do it with payments that do not
affect the acreage or price of specific crops.
   He also said Argentina and Brazil have stepped up soybean
production and might try to take advantage of the 1988 drought and
U.S. bean shortfall as they plant their next crops.
   ``Keep your eye on South America as the fall and winter
progresses,'' said Bader. ``It will become a South
American-controlled market price.''
   But analyst Bruce Henrikson of Adams & Associates in Champaign
said there now is some concern about dry conditions in Argentina
and Brazil, and planting has been delayed.
   Bader said agricultural products have helped ease the United
States' foreign trade deficit, but he was not optimistic about
soybean exports in the short term.
   ``Because of our supply, our export figures are going to be
down,'' he said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's finance minister changed his earlier
testimony and said today that 10,000 shares of stock in a firm
involved in an insider trading scandal were purchased in his name.
   Kiichi Miyazawa is the first Cabinet member linked directly to
the scandal over unlisted shares of the real estate firm
Recruit-Cosmos Co. that were sold later for large profits after the
company went public.
   ``I never intended to hide it from the public, but I just found
out about it myself a few days ago,'' Miyazawa said in response to
questions from opposition parties in parliament.
   Several other senior officials, including Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, have said their aides purchased shares in the company
without their knowledge.
   Miyazawa told the Diet, Japan's parliament, in August that a
former aide, Tsuneo Hattori, bought the stock on his own, and did
not acknowledge any direct involvement.
   ``I conferred with Mr. Hattori recently after the case was
revealed and learned that he used my name to make things work more
smoothly,'' Miyazawa said. ``He told me that he was asked by his
friend to lend my name and he responded to the request carelessly.''
   But Miyazawa continued to deny any previous knowledge about the
dealings and said, ``People including myself and my aides were
never involved in the dealings themselves.''
   A number of senior politicians and business leaders reportedly
obtained unlisted shares of Recruit-Cosmos in 1984 and earned up to
$780,000 each in profits by selling them after public trading began
a short time later. The price of the stock nearly quadrupled soon
after the shares were placed on the over-the-counter market.
   No criminal charges have been filed against those who bought the
shares, but opposition parties have raised ethical questions about
the politicians who were involved.
   The controversy has highlighted the frequently lucrative ties
between businessmen and politicians in Japan. Trading on privileged
information is a widely accepted practice. New laws passed since
the scandal unfolded this summer deal more stringently with insider
trading, but are not retroactive.
   The Japan Communist Party on Tuesday released a list of nine
people, including Miyazawa, who allegedly purchased shares in the
company through Do-Best Inc., a financial firm linked to
Recruit-Cosmos.
   The list included aides to Prime Minister Takeshita, former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Shintaro Abe, secretary
general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   Takeshita has said a former aide obtained 2,000 shares of
Recruit-Cosmos stock through another firm and sold them shortly
after public trading began, earning a profit of about $31,000.
   Opposition parties fiercely attacked Miyazawa today for his
personal involvement in the stock dealings and his previous
testimony.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Predicts Downward Trend In U.S. Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite recent fluctuations, the U.S. trade deficit
is on a downward trend, U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Friday.
   Greenspan also said international monetary coordination had not
changed in recent months and that the major world financial powers
still hold a policy of currency stability.
   Greenspan, in Tokyo for meetings with Japanese central bank
directors and government officials, made his comments at a news
conference against a background of a sharp drop in the exchange
value of the U.S. dollar this week, aggravated by a
larger-than-projected U.S. trade deficit for August.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo Friday at 128.25 yen, about 5 yen
below the level it held most of last week.
   Greenspan agreed that the $12.18 billion August trade deficit
was higher than most predictions but said it was better to use an
average of trade figures than one month's figure because ``they are
by nature highly erratic.''
   ``The trade adjustment process seems to be moving appropriately,
that is, the trend is clearly downward in the American trade
deficit,'' he said.
   He said he suspected most forecasts of the August deficit were
too low because oil-import data published earlier by the U.S.
Department of Energy were lower than the final statistics, causing
forecasters to underestimate an important sector of the trade
figures.
   Asked about international coordination to stabilize exchange
rates, Greenspan said, ``The agreements in recent months are
essentially unchanged.''
   At meetings in Berlin in late September, monetary officials made
no fundamental change in the policy of the seven major industrial
nations, he said. ``We seek stability in exchange rates.''
   Asked whether movements in exchange rates this year have been
within the limits of stability envisioned by the seven industrial
powers, Greenspan replied, ``Broadly, yes.''
   The Fed chairman declined to answer several questions about
specifics of exchange rates and about whether more coordinated
support was needed in view of the dollar's slide this week.
   Asked whether his meetings here had included discussion of
adding Special Drawing Rights, a basket-type international
currency, or the Japanese yen as international reserve currencies,
Greenspan replied no.
   Recently there have been some suggestions that the increasingly
strong yen could become a reserve currency, lifting some of the
pressure from the U.S. dollar.
   Greenspan said international holdings of yen are not large, and
there was a tendency for there to be only one major world currency.
   Although he had meetings Thursday and Friday with Bank of Japan
Governor Satoshi Sumida, the Japanese central bank declined to
comment on them.
   Greenspan also was meeting with Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
Friday, then returning to the United States on Saturday, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Order; SEC Reportedly Investigating Trading In
Pillsbury Stock</HEAD>

   A judge has lifted a restraining order that
blocked Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC from acquiring an interest
in Pillsbury Co. and blocked Pillsbury from taking steps to thwart
Grand Met's $5.2 billion takeover bid.
   The lifting of the day-old order on Thursday, at Pillsbury's
request, frees the company to make an acquisition or take other
defensive action.
   Separately, officials of both companies said the Securities and
Exchange Commission has launched an inquiry into trading of
Pillsbury stock prior to the Oct. 4 announcement of Grand
Metropolitan's $60-a-share tender offer for the food and restaurant
giant.
   Pillsbury's trading volume was extremely high, and there were
heavy purchases of options to buy Pillsbury shares in the future at
$40 each in the week before the tender offer was announced.
   In Washington, Chiles Larson, the SEC's deputy director of
public affairs, said he could not confirm or deny the existence of
any investigation of trading in Pillsbury stock.
   Grand Met attorney Allen Finkelson said the British company
considers the investigation ``routine.''
   Pillsbury stock closed at $57.25 a share, up 37{ cents in New
York Stock Exchange trading Thursday.
   On Wednesday, Hennepin County District Court Judge Thomas Carey
issued the order blocking Grand Met from acquiring any Pillsbury
stock and preventing Pillsbury from altering the status quo until
Oct. 27.
   On that date, the judge is to hear further arguments in
Pillsbury's lawsuit seeking to block the Grand Met tender offer on
the grounds that it violated state statutes that prevent liquor
distillers from selling liquor in retail outlets.
   Pillsbury's retail liquor outlets include the full-service
restaurant chains of Steak & Ale and Bennigan's. Grand Met is
seeking waivers from the law in Minnesota and other states, saying
it will immediately sell Pillsbury's liquor retail outlets if the
takeover is successful.
   Federal securities law already prevents Grand Met from acquiring
Pillsbury stock until its tender offer expires Nov. 1.
   Analysts note that Pillsbury is now free to defend itself
against the bid. Possible defenses could include selling off its
restaurants to raise money to go private or taking on additional
debt.
   Pillsbury has been fighting the bid but has not yet officially
rejected the offer. Under federal securities laws, Pillsbury has
until Wednesday to respond to the offer.
   Pillsbury has sued in 14 states to block the tender offer on
grounds it violates state statutes.

   The stock market headed higher today in a broad
advance led by International Business Machines shares.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.42 to 2,142.73 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 731 up, 375 down and
523 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 56.58 million shares at
midmorning.
   IBM climbed 1] to 120 in active trading after the company
reported third-quarter earnings of $2.10 a share, up from $2 in the
comparable period last year.
   John Akers, the company's chairman, said, ``Worldwide demand is
strong across our product line.''
   With its long-standing position as the No. 1 holding of
investing institutions, IBM is often described as a ``bellwether''
stock that can influence the overall trend of the market.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price index rose 0.4 percent in September. That was in line with
advance estimates on Wall Street.
   Meanwhile, figures showing flat industrial production and a 0.4
percent drop in retail sales last month provided support for the
belief that economic growth was slowing to a more moderate, and
presumably more sustainable, pace.
   Hospital Corp. of America gained 3 to 47{. A management group
raised its offer to buy out the company from $47 a share to $51 a
share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.69 to 156.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .76 at 302.80.

<HEAD>Capitalism Thrives in `Special Economic Zone'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CINTY LI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SHENZHEN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A smaller version of Hong Kong's
capitalist wonderland has attracted hordes of young people to this
``special economic zone'' of communist China in search of
opportunity and a fast buck.
   With the influx have come reports of labor strife, exploitation
of child workers, prostitution and a plague of beggars in the town
adjacent to the British crown colony, which is to be returned to
China in 1997.
   Migrant workers account for about half the 600,000 people in the
border community, which in 1979 became China's first and largest
testing ground for market-oriented economic reform.
   The other special economic zones, also in southern China, are in
Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen.
   Many Shenzhen factories are joint ventures with foreign
investors and wages generally are much higher than elsewhere in
China.
   Zhang Ruo-yong, a 19-year-old from Shantou, about 300 miles
northeast, quit her fourth Shenzhen job in weeks because the pay
was too low, even though the monthly wage of 200 yuan ($54) a day
was more than double the average 76 yuan paid elsewhere in China.
   ``I had a job that paid four yuan ($1.08) a day, but that was
too little,'' she said. ``I found another one that paid eight yuan,
but working in an electronics factory was too hard.''
   Beggars have followed the money.
   The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily newspaper reported in August
that a ``professional beggar family'' from Henan province, 520
miles north, made enough money to buy a cassette player, meals of
fish and chicken and a regular supply of expensive American
cigarettes.
   It said they arrived two years ago and the four children earned
up to 200 yuan ($54) a day from begging while their father watched.
   Despite the relatively high pay, living conditions usually are
Spartan, particularly for unmarried workers in factory dormitories.
   A 19-year-old who gave only her surname Li works at a large
electronics factory that assigned her to a room of 80 square feet
with nine other women.
   ``How would I not miss home?'' said Miss Li, a native of Hainan
Island, 580 miles southwest of Shenzhen. She added, however, that
life in the factory was better than toiling on a rubber plantation.
   Miss Zhang from Shantou expressed a sentiment common to most
migrants: The higher pays makes the sacrifices worthwhile.
   Articles published by the China Youth News last summer reported
21 strikes in Shenzhen in 1986-87.
   The paper said workers at a doll factory, who normally put in
six eight-hour days a week, were forced to work 14-hour shifts
without a day off and one was fired when they went on strike.
   Workers rarely strike elsewhere in China and seldom are fired.
   Shenzhen government officials denied the reports of strikes.
   ``They were just minor disputes,'' said Zhu Wendui, deputy
director of the Shenzhen Labor Bureau. ``Sometimes the wages were
delayed because of a foreign- exchange transaction, or the workers
were not accustomed to strict management. It is different from
strikes in the West.''
   General manager Kong Qingping of the government-run Shenzhen
Labor Service Co. which helps factories recruit workers, said
overtime generally is limited to 48 hours a month, but added:
   ``The economy is developing so quickly that manufacturers are
absorbed in increasing production and might overlook the welfare of
the workers.''
   China Youth News also said more than 1,000 rural teen-agers,
half of them grade-school students, were recruited from neighboring
Guangxi province to work in sweatshop-like factories run by foreign
investors.
   It said conditions were ``incredibly bad'' at a factory making
silk flowers and 12-year-old girls worked 15-hour shifts, sleeping
two or three to a bed in a tent serving as a dormitory.
   A 16-year-old girl showed a reporter a petal-shaped mark on her
hand she said was caused by a burn from a machine, the paper
reported.
   Kong said authorities began investigating the use of illegal
child labor in April and 300 children were returned to their
hometowns. It is against the law for Shenzhan factories to hire
workers under 16, but some ignore the rule because children can be
paid less.
   ``If we find out the employer is hiding the fact, we will cancel
his license,'' Kong said. ``In fact, most of them laid off child
workers after we warned them.''
   Chinese news reports claim promiscuity, homosexuality and
prostitution have increased among the estimated 250,000 female
migrant workers, who outnumber men 50-1 in many factories.
   One report in the China Youth News quoted a police psychologist
as saying ``the women's hearts are like kindling wood. When they
meet the fire of love, the flames will rage.''
   In the Shekou industrial district of Shenzhen, the number of
unwanted pregnancies quadrupled from about 200 in 1985 to 800 in
1987, the paper said.
   Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing paper in Hong Kong, said 122
prostitutes were arrested in Shenzhen hotels last June. It said
their clients included Hong Kong businessmen, truck drivers,
Shenzhen policemen and Communist Party functionaries.
   Shenzhen officials declined comment on the report.

<HEAD>Opinion: Farming Doesn't Require `Labor'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You don't have to work the land to be
considered a farmer under Iowa law, the state attorney general's
office said Friday.
   At issue was the legal definition of farming used in state laws
aimed at preserving family farms.
   ``The General Assembly did not impose any requirement in the
definition of farming which requires actual physical labor in
performing the various activities which constitute farming,'' wrote
Timothy Benton, an assistant attorney general. ``The Legislature
has the prerogative of defining its own terms.''
   Lawmakers over the years have carved out a series of protections
for ``family farm corporations,'' farmers who incorporate their
operation, and Crawford County Attorney Thomas Gustafson wanted to
know if those who owned such a business actually had to work the
land to qualify.
   State law prohibits corporate ownership of farmland, but family
farm operations are exempt from that ban.
   Gustafson said the question was sparked by a farm corporation
which leased farmland on a crop-share basis and ``the actual
physical labor on the agricultural land which the corporation owns
is performed by the tenant.''
   The opinion said there's nothing in state law banning a family
farm corporation from leasing its land.
   ``We cannot add such a requirement through the guise of
statutory construction,'' Benton wrote.
   Benton noted that state law covering farming operations is
extensive, and lawmakers could have easily added a requirement that
farmers actually work the land, but have chosen not to do so.
   ``In the definition of `actively engaged in farming' there is no
requirement of actual physical labor on the farm,'' Benton wrote.
``The definition can be satisfied if the shareholder or officer of
the corporation either inspects the production activities
periodically and contributes toward the cost of production, or
takes an important part in farm management decisions, or performs
the actual physical work.
   ``Consequently, under the lexicon of the General Assembly a
shareholder or officer need not perform actual physical labor to be
actively engaged in farming,'' the opinion said.
   Benton noted that lawmakers have debated the issue during the
past two legislative sessions.
   ``However, the General Assembly has not chosen to amend the
provisions involved in your question, so we can conclude it has no
interest in imposing a requirement of actual physical labor in
these definitions,'' he wrote.
   ``This is consistent with the definition of farming itself,
which as we noted also does not impose such a requirement,'' Benton
wrote in the opinion.

   The Miami News, a struggling afternoon newspaper,
will be shut down if no buyer is found by the end of the year, Cox
Enterprises said today.
   The staff of the News was informed of the decision this morning
in the newsroom.
   ``Quite simply, The Miami News, despite an outstanding editorial
presentation, is not supported by advertisers or readers,'' David
Easterly, president of the Cox newspaper division, said in a
statement released in Atlanta.
   ``Daily circulation has declined from 112,000 in 1966 to below
48,000 today while Dade County households have grown by 80 percent
in the same period. This means that The Miami News now serves fewer
than 8 percent of Dade County households.''
   The Miami News has had a joint operating agreement with The
Miami Herald, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., since 1966.
   The Herald, a morning newspaper with daily circulation of more
than 400,000, is responsible for providing advertising,
circulation, production and promotion services to the News.
Atlanta-based Cox owns the newspaper and manages only the editorial
department of the News.
   Cox shares in the profits of the Miami Herald Publishing
Company, and until last year Knight-Ridder had shared in the losses
at the News.
   James C. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Cox,
made the announcement that the News will cease publication if no
buyer is found by year's end.
   ``It is with a deep sense of sorrow and regret that we make this
announcement,'' Kennedy said, noting that the News has published
since 1896 and won five Pulitzer Prizes.
   Among its staff is editorial cartoonist Don Wright, a Pulitzer
Prize winner whose work is syndicated in newspapers across the
country.
   Easterly said that since 1966, Knight-Ridder and Cox have spent
more than $90 million in operating the News. He said the net cost
of publishing the News is now running about $9 million annually and
would be expected to worsen over time.
   Several years ago, Cox proposed to Knight-Ridder an extension of
the joint operating agreement, Kennedy said. After numerous
meetings, Knight-Ridder and Cox entered into an agreement in
January 1987, which permitted Cox to continue sharing in the
profits of The Miami Herald at a reduced rate until 2021.
   However, the new agreement required Cox to fund all losses from
the operation of the News, and Kennedy said months of study
determined there was not way to reverse the circulation and
advertising declines and keep the newspaper alive.
   Under the new agreement, Knight-Ridder will pay Cox Enterprises
a percentage of the Herald's profits, based on a sliding scale,
through the year 2021, even if the News ceases publication.
   The profit percentage, which was 15 percent under the old
agreement, will decline to 10 percent over the next five years and
will remain at that level until 2021, said Easterly.
   That means Cox could earn $165 million from the Herald, by
conservative estimates based on current figures, over the next 33
years, Easterly said.
   ``The business facts and market conditions in Miami have left us
with only one conclusion _ that The Miami News is not a viable,
general interest newspaper for the future,'' Kennedy said.

<HEAD>Anschutz Completes Southern Pacific Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Philip Anschutz has completed a $1.8
billion acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the
nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from Oregon to
Louisiana.
   The historic railroad, combined with his Denver & Rio Grande
Railroad, puts Anschutz at the head of the nation's fifth-largest
rail company in terms of track mileage.
   The purchase ``ends years of uncertainty and opens the door to
robust competition in the western rail corridors,'' said Rio Grande
Chariman W. J. Holtman at the deal's closing in New York on
Thursday.
   ``This historic combination brings together two railroads which
hold an important place in the pioneering of the West,'' he noted.
   Anschutz's new railroad has 15,046 miles of track and is ranked
sixth nationally based on revenues estimated at $2.5 billion. The
Rocky Mountain News reported that he paid $1.02 billion in cash and
assumed $760 million in debt.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the combination in
August. Last year the ICC rejected a proposal that Chicago-based
Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. merge the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe railroads and ordered the company to divest one of the
lines.
   The company chose to sell the Southern Pacific, but had to
overcome the objections of another rail company before it could
proceed. Southern Pacific's stock has been held in a trust for
nearly five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should
own the railroad.
   Anschutz, who made his fortune in oil, gas and real estate, will
become chairman of Southern Pacific.
   Mike Mohan, now executive vice president of Southern Pacific,
will become the chief executive of both lines, which will operate
from Southern Pacific's San Francisco headquarters. D&RG had been
headquartered in Denver.
   Anschutz has said 400 to 800 jobs will be lost through the
consolidation of the two companies. The cuts likely will be split
evenly between San Francisco and Denver.
   The two lines will remain separate entities, although both will
be held by Rio Grande Industries Inc., said Anschutz's attorney,
Bob Starzel.
   D&RG mainly carries coal on about 2,500 miles of track between
Kansas City, Mo., and Colorado and Utah and rents track to other
railroads. Three times a week runs the Rio Grande Zephyr from Salt
Lake City to Denver.
   ``This creates the only western railroad with two rail
corridors. ... Now, Southern Pacific and Rio Grande will be in both
the southern and central corridors,'' Starzel said.

<TEXT>
   Share prices finished higher Friday, helped by a
strong start on Wall Street and some new purchases at the start of
the new two-week trading account on London's Stock Exchange late in
the afternoon.
   A late buying surge in the oil sector also gave the overall
market a boost, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 9.9
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 1,840.6, near the day's best
level of 1,841.2.
   The index opened at its lowest level, down 3.6 points.
   Overall volume was moderately healthy, with 567 million shares
traded, compared with 466 million shares Thursday.
   For most of the day trading remained calm, with the 100-share
index hardly moving from a 3-point range. Dealers said the market
had little inspiration to wander, especially because the latest
two-week trading account wound to a close and the new one began in
the afternoon.
   The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week
periods for accounting purposes.
   Then, Wall Street opened up strongly, with the Dow Jones
industrial average shooting 15 points higher shortly after the
opening bell. By the close of London trading, Wall Street was up
9.78 points at 2,143.14.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Trustee Moves To Gain Control of Oil Heir's Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trustee in Cullen Davis' bankruptcy
proceeding has filed a motion to gain control of the oilman's
earnings in a deal that made $4 million in 1986 for Davis and his
brother.
   Twalla Dupriest, the court-appointed guardian of Cullen Davis'
assets, said she should have control of his share of the earnings,
believed to be about $2 million.
   In her motion filed Thursday, Ms. Dupriest asked U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Massie Tillman to order the two Davis brothers and
representatives of the Kendavis Holding Co. and CS&S Liquidating
Co., once known as Cummins Sales and Service Inc., to appear in
court and reveal Cullen Davis' earnings in the 1986 deal.
   Officials said the $4 million is in an escrow account, pending
the outcome of an unrelated dispute in Dallas federal court.
   Once one of the world's wealthiest men, Davis filed Chapter 7
bankruptcy last July, listing debts of $865 million and assets of
$1.8 million.
   In December, Tillman wiped out $850 million in debts for Davis.
The judge restored the debts in February, after Dupriest said Davis
had hidden or improperly transferred assets.
   Attorneys said the $4 million in dispute was to be paid to Davis
and his brother, Kenneth W. Davis, in a deal involving Kendavis
Industries and Kendavis Holding Co. for the sale of Cummins Sales
and Service Inc. to Cummins Red River Diesel for about $58 million
in 1986.
   But several banks, owed money by the Davises, argued that the
funds should not be paid to the brothers. That case is now pending
in a Dallas federal court.
   In 1986, the Davises lost control of Kendavis Industries after
it was involuntarily thrust into bankruptcy court by 21 banks owed
about $500 million. The downturn in the energy industry crippled
the conglomerate.

<TEXT>
   Growing pessimism about the dollar dragged it
lower Friday in moderate European trading, one day after the
currency slumped because of the wider U.S. trade gap.
   Gold prices were slightly higher.
   Dollar-buying picked up in foreign exchange markets Friday
morning in what dealers termed a reaction to the selloff Thursday.
But the U.S. currency lost its early gains once New York markets
opened, dealers said.
   ``We have been bearish here for a while,'' said one London-based
dealer, ``but New York has finally gotten the idea the dollar is
going down.''
   The U.S. currency plunged Thursday on American government
figures showing an August trade deficit of $12.8 billion compared
with a revised July shortfall of $9.47 billion.
   Marginal U.S. economic indicators released Friday provided no
help. Retail sales fell 0.2 percent in September from a revised
fall of 0.1 percent in August, while producer prices rose 0.4
percent in September from an unrevised figure of 0.6 percent in
August.
   ``They were nothing numbers, but nothing numbers in bearish
markets are sell numbers,'' a London dealer said.
   Dealers in Frankfurt predicted the dollar's decline will
continue next week.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.27 yen to a closing 128.25 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted lower at 127.985 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7550 to buy one pound, more than $1.7470 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:

   The stock market headed lower today after an
early rally faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 14 points at
its early peak, was off 11.56 at 2,121.80 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 595 up, 715 down and
534 unchanged.
   Analysts said the early advance was blunted by weakness in the
dollar and an upswing in interest rates, which had fallen in early
activity.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price index rose 0.4 percent in September. That was in line with
advance estimates on Wall Street.
   Meanwhile, figures showing flat industrial production and a 0.4
percent drop in retail sales last month provided support for the
belief that economic growth was slowing to a more moderate, and
presumably more sustainable, pace.
   IBM climbed 1 to 119| in active trading after the company
reported third-quarter earnings of $2.10 a share, up from $2 in the
comparable period last year.
   John Akers, the company's chairman, said, ``Worldwide demand is
strong across our product line.''
   Hospital Corp. of America gained 3[ to 47|. A management group
raised its offer to buy out the company from $47 a share to $51 a
share.
   Wickes Cos. tumbled 3{ to 7[. A group of executives said it
planned to withdraw a $12-a-share bid for Wickes stock, citing a
deterioration in the company's operating income.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.55 to 154.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .41 at 301.63.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.42 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Agriculture Officials Release Sterile Medflies in Eradication
Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sterile Mediterranean fruit flies are being
deployed by the millions in an effort to eradicate an infestation
of the crop-destroying pest on the city's West Side.
   About 8 million sterile flies were released Thursday and
millions more will be turned loose for the next several days, said
county Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy.
   If a sterile fly breeds with a fertile fly, there are no
offspring.
   State, federal and county agriculture officials already have
sprayed pesticide over a 35-square-mile area that includes parts of
Beverly Hills and other affluent neighborhoods west of downtown.
   A quarantine, imposed across a 76-square-mile area Oct. 7, will
likely remain in effect for months, officials said.
   The quarantine forbids the transfer of commercial fruits and
vegetables from the infested area, which includes the Farmer's
Market, a major West Side tourist attraction.
   The pest is considered a threat to California's
multi-million-dollar farm economy because medflies destroy about
250 types of fruits and vegetables.

<HEAD>Thrift Problems Preoccupy Bankers Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Against a projected backdrop of billowy clouds
and angelic figures an obscure Hawaiian minister kicked off an
annual bankers' gathering here with a prayer for stable interest
rates and economic prosperity.
   Not a typical invocation from a man of the cloth, but serious
business for those who control much of America's pursestrings and
face the uncertainty of a new president in the aftermath of Black
Monday.
   ``It's been a wild and wooly year,'' recalled Charles Pistor,
outgoing president of the giant American Bankers Association whose
term began on Black Monday. ``Despite the stock market drop ... we
did make progress in 1988. But there are some things we have not
seen this year.''
   A perennial concern is banking reform legislation. However, that
seems likely to be overshadowed in the coming year by the mounting
problems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Co., which
insures the nation's 3,200 thifts.
   ``The issue of FSLIC will be more overriding than banking
reform,'' Pistor, chairman of Northpark National Bank of Dallas,
told reporters at the 114th annual ABA convention in Honolulu this
past week. ``Congress must deal early on with the problem.''
   At stake is about a quarter of the federally insured S&Ls, which
are considered at or near insolvency. Estimates for liquidating or
bailing them out have ranged from $45 billion to $100 billion, far
too costly for the financially strapped FSLIC.
   Bankers worry that the problem may spill over to them since
Congress could consider merging the financially strapped FSLIC with
the healthier Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures the
nation's 14,000 commercial banks and some thrifts.
   A merger of the two insurance funds, which both insure
individual's deposits of up to $100,000, has long been opposed by
bankers and the FDIC itself. For one thing, they fear a merger
would drive up the cost of bank insurance premiums, which run about
2{ percentage points below what thrifts pay.
   Bankers also worry that tapping into the FDIC may aggravate
banks' own failure problem. The FDIC says a record number of banks
will fail this year _ as many as 250, compared with a record 184
last year and 19 others that needed federal assistance.
   Still, Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke warned
bankers at their four-day convention that an FSLIC-FDIC is a
distinct possibility, and that the industry should take a more
active role in dealing with the thrift problem or risk being ``a
prisoner of events.''
   ``Merging the FDIC insurance fund with the thrift insurance fund
has a political attractivess that cannot be ignored,'' Clarke
insisted. ``Certainly, there isn't enough money in the FDIC to
solve the problem. But the fund is enough to serve as a significant
down payment and it is available.
   ``Like all the other independent agencies in our government, the
FDIC is a creature of Congress. And what Congress gives, Congress
can take away.''
   In an emotional rejoinder, though, FDIC Chairman L. William
Seidman promised to defend the fund and ``prevent the problems of
the S&Ls from being billed to banks.''
   He said the FDIC plans to complete a study after Election Day
that began about eight months ago on possible solutions for the
thrift crisis.
   The ABA also has promised to conduct its own studies.
   ``This is a complicated issue. We don't know with certainty how
big this problem is,'' said newly elected ABA President Thomas R.
Rideout, vice chairman of First Union National Bank of North
Carolina. ``Debate is just beginning. I think ABA has been early on
in shaping public policy.''
   The ABA also promises to keep its hand in shaping banking reform
legislation before the next Congress.
   A turf battle between House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand
J. St Germain, D-R.I., and House Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., quashed a measure that would have
allowed banks to underwrite securities for the first time since the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.

   In other business news this past week:
   _Real estate devloper Donald Trump agreed to buy Eastern
Airlines' profitable Northeast shuttle for $365 million in cash and
said he would rename it after himself. Eastern's unions said they
would try to block the deal.
   _Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. dropped its $5.03 billion bid for
the supermarket retailer Kroger Co. after the target company
rejected the offer. Meanwhile, the Haft family, which has a $4.32

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Lower On Lack Of Grain Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed modestly lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment
over the failure of U.S. and Soviet negotiators to produce a new
long-term grain agreement.
   Negotiators ended two days of talks Friday in London with no
agreement and no date for the next round of talks.
   The latest five-year agreement expired on Sept. 30 and although
the Soviet Union has made some large purchases of U.S. grains since
then, the two nations are believed to be wide apart on terms for a
new long-term deal, analysts said.
   Expectations for good harvesting weather this weekend provoked
additional selling of corn and soybean futures.
   ``We're far enough along in the harvesting where you've got to
think we'll be in the 65 percent completion range come Monday, said
Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.30\ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 2 cents lower with December at $2.95\ a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.55{ a bushel; soybean
were 1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with November at $8.08{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   A group of Wickes Companies Inc.
managers on Friday withdrew their $598 million buyout offer for the
home and industrial products company, citing deteriorating earnings.
   The group, led by Wickes Chairman Sanford Sigoloff, announced
the decision along with a report that warned the company might lose
money on continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters and
the fiscal year.
   Operating income for the year could be $40 million less than
what was forecast at the time the buyout offer was made on Aug. 21,
the company said. Operating income for August and September was $15
million below projections, the company said.
   Future earnings are critical to a leveraged buyout transaction
because the acquiror must rely on cash flow to help repay loans
used to finance the purchase.
   The management group offered to pay $12 for each Wickes share in
a leveraged buyout. But the offer included a 60-day wait before the
group could begin buying shares in order to give other bidders a
chance to surface.
   Last week, as the Oct. 20 deadline approached, the company
announced that it hadn't received any offers although it had
discussed selling all or part of the company with a number of
potential buyers.
   Wickes is involved in a number of diverse businesses that some
analysts have said are more attractive individually than as a
group. The company's main businesses include Wickes Furniture and
Builders Emporium do-it-yourself stores in Southern California. The
company also manufactures auto fabrics, wallpaper, carpet and
aircraft and missile parts.

   Allegheny Internatinal Inc. said Friday it
still intends to emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization by year's
end or early in 1989 even though the parties in the case have asked
for a month's delay in a key hearing.
   Allegheny officials told Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti on
Thursday that they need time to study $2.5 billion in claims
pending against the Pittsburgh-based consumer products company.
   ``It's very common for large claims to be made, but they are
ultimately settled for significantly less,'' said company spokesman
Edward Romanoff.
   Cosetti scheduled a hearing for Thursday to disclose financial
details needed by creditors to judge the merits of any
reorganization plan. The judge did not immediately decide whether
to postpone the hearing, although he said he was losing patience
with the case.
   Meanwhile in New York, a private investment firm that holds a 7
percent stake in Allegheny International, sued the company's
accountant and its investment adviser, claiming securities laws
were violated in the 1987 financial statements.
   The shareholder, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg filed separate federal
suits against Peat Marwick Main & Co. and Dillon Read & Co.
   Allegheny International has said an unspecified number of
potential investors are showing interest in infusing the company
with cash needed to get back on its feet.
   They are reported to be Remington Products Co. owner Victor
Kiam, Los Angeles Industrialist David H. Murdock, the New York
investment house Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, the New York leveraged
buyout firm Odyssey Partners, and Paul Levy, former investment
banker at Drexel Burnhan Lambert.

<TEXT>
   Biotechnology will boost agricultural
output in the 1990s, but the new science will drive a lot of
farmers out of business, says an expert in the field.
   Michael Phillips, senior associate for the congressional Office
of Technology Assessment, said the steady decline in the number of
farmers since the 1930s will increase in the 1990s because of the
higher investments and keen management skills needed to thrive in
the biotechnology age.
   ``The early adapters will benefit the most and the laggards will
be left behind,'' Phillips said Thursday at a meeting of top farm
policy and agribusiness leaders at a two-day farm conference ending
Friday.
   Middle-sized farmers _ full-time farmers who annually sell less
than a quarter million dollars worth of crops and livestock _ will
feel the biggest squeeze from the gains made in biotechnology
during the 1990s, Phillips predicted.
   Biotechnology is the use of data and techniques of engineering
and technology to study and solve problems involving living
organisms.
   Small farmers with off-farm income can almost ignore the
revolution, Phillips said, but medium-sized farmers will have to
scramble to keep up with farmers who will have an easier time
adopting the new biotechnology processes.
   The squeeze on the middle-sized farms means that by the year
2000, 86 percent of the nation's food will be produced by only 14
percent of the farmers, Phillips predicted.
   He predicted that the first wave of agricultural biotechnology
breakthroughs will come in livestock production, while most of the
advances in plant agriculture will not be available to farmers
until the late 1990s.
   Walter Hobgood Jr., director of animal nutrition and health for
Monsanto Agricultural Co., said a new hormone which will be
injected into cows every two weeks to boost milk production could
be on the market as early as next year and will be adopted by most
dairy farmers in the next five years.
   Phillips predicted a genetically engineered hormone that will
make hogs grow faster and leaner will be approved and ready for
sale to farmers by about 1995.

<HEAD>IBM Reports 3.2 Percent Gain In Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp.'s profit
rose 3.2 percent in the third quarter, the world's largest computer
maker said Friday in a report that lifted its stock.
   Revenue climbed 5.3 percent, an indication that IBM is
succeeding in switching customers to new large and mid-sized
computers without a big drop in sales of older models, analysts
said.
   IBM's stock was up $1.37{ a share at $120 in late trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   ``They (earnings) were pretty decent,'' said Steven Cohen, an
analyst for Soundview Financial Group, formerly Gartner Securities,
in Stamford, Conn.
   The July-September quarter was the seventh consecutive one in
which revenue and shipments surpassed levels of a year earlier,
John F. Akers, IBM's chairman and chief executive, said in a
written statement.
   ``We are pleased with our customers' response to our recently
announced products and services,'' Akers said.
   IBM said it earned $1.25 billion in the quarter, or $2.10 a
share, up from $1.21 billion, or $2 a share, in the year-earlier
period. Revenue rose to $13.4 billion from $12.7 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, IBM said its
profit rose 9.1 percent to $3.46 billion, or $5.83 a share, from
$3.17 billion, or $5.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7
percent to $38.7 billion from $36.2 billion.
   Results in the 1988 nine-month period were depressed by a $600
million second-quarter charge for costs of manufacturing and
headquarters consolidations.
   The cost-cutting efforts showed signs of paying off, as IBM
managed to post an improvement in the ratio of operating profits to
total revenue.
   ``The fact that they can show margin improvement on only a 5
percent revenue gain shows that they're getting their costs under
control,'' Cohen said.
   During the third quarter IBM began shipments of a major new line
of mid-sized computers, the Application System-400, and an upgraded
version of its 3090 family of mainframe computers.
   The success of those shipments contributed to a 9.3 percent gain
in sales, the largest component of revenue. In contrast,
maintenance services fell 4.5 percent, an unexpected development,
said Don Young, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

   Jockey International Inc. will buy the
Bloomsburg Mills facility in Abbeville County and will increase
employment by as many as 100 people, officials announced Friday.
   ``Each announcement brings us one step closer to broad economic
prosperity in Abbeville County, and I want to thank the Jockey
Company for choosing a South Carolina home for one of their
facilities,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said in a news release.
   Campbell said his office had committed up to $250,000 in
Community Development Block Grant funds to Abbeville County to
assist Jockey in opening a plant in the county.
   Bloomsburg Mills currently operates a 50-person spinning
operation in the 200,000-square-foot plant that once housed a much
larger spinning and weaving operation. Jockey, which will take over
operations at the facility in April, will be acquiring equipment
and modifying the building in the interim, said company President
Howard Cooley.
   ``We are working with Bloomsburg Mills to maintain a continuity
of employment at the plant during the change-over period,'' he
said, adding the company would eventually have a work force of 150
people.
   The plant will produce cotton yarn for Jockey knitting
operations in North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky, he
said. The company has another yarn facility in North Carolina.
   Campbell said it took months of hard work, ``behind the
scenes,'' to bring the deal to fruition. ``The people of Abbeville
County and state government have formed a partnership to make this
decision a success for the county and for Jockey.''

   The stock market closed little changed today
after a early advance gave way to afternoon selling.
   Analysts said the rise at the outset was blunted by weakness in
the dollar and an upswing in interest rates, which had fallen in
early activity.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price index rose 0.4 percent in September. That was in line with
advance estimates on Wall Street.
   Meanwhile, figures showing flat industrial production and a 0.4
percent drop in retail sales last month provided support for the
belief that economic growth was slowing to a more moderate, and
presumably more sustainable, pace.
   Brokers also said traders drew some encouragement from a
favorable International Business Machines earnings report.
   IBM climbed 1[ to 119} in active trading after the company
reported third-quarter earnings of $2.10 a share, up from $2 in the
comparable period last year.

   More Canadians support a free trade agreement
with the United States, but people remain sharply split over the
dominant issue in the election campaign, according to a poll
published Friday.
   The poll by the Environics Research Group and the independent
Globe and Mail newspaper show 44 percent of Canadians support and
42 percent oppose the agreement signed by President Reagan and
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in January.
   Support increased by 7 percentage points from the last poll
conducted in June, but opposition also increased by 2 percentage
points. The number of undecided Canadians dropped to 14 percent.
   The poll was based on 1,515 interviews conducted throughout
Canada between Oct. 2 and 10. The margin of error was 2.5 percent.
   A victory for Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party in the
Nov. 21 election would remove any stumbling blocks from
parliamentary approval of the agreement, scheduled to take effect
Jan. 1.
   Both opposing parties, the Liberals and the socialist New
Democrats, say they would tear up the agreement.
   The most recent Gallup poll, taken last week, shows the
Conservatives ahead with 43 percent, the Liberals with 33 percent
and the New Democrats with 22 percent.
   An Environics poll published Tuesday found the Conservatives
ahead with 42 percent of decided voters, the New Democrats in what
would be a stunning second-place finish with 29 percent and the
Liberals trailing with 25 percent.
   Such an outcome would preserve the Conservatives' majority in
the House of Commons.
   The free-trade deal would eliminate all tariffs between Canada
and the United States and eventually put Canada's 26 million people
in open competition with the 245 million people of its more
powerful and wealthier southern neighbor.
   It would mean the dismantling of a system of high tariffs that
date back to the 19th century.
   Opponents charge Canada's very existence as a sovereign nation
could be endangered by the agreement, but supporters scoff at that
idea and say the agreement would ensure future prosperity.
   The free trade agreement has raised few hackles in the United
States, where the Senate approved it 83-9 last month. At least 70
percent of the $150 billion in trade each year between the
countries already is tariff-free.
   Mulroney, 49, a former corporate lawyer, led a landslide victory
for his party in 1984. John Turner leads the Liberals and Ed
Broadbent the New Democrats.

<HEAD>Lockheed Wins Contract To Build New Sub-Hunting Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Friday tapped the Lockheed Corp.
to build a new submarine-hunting patrol plane, providing the
California contractor the opportunity to extend a quarter-century
monopoly on such work.
   The initial contract is worth only $200,000, the Navy said
Friday, but ``a full-scale engineering development contract will be
awarded after formal review of the program by the Department of
Defense,'' the Navy said.
   Ultimately, the selection decision could be worth up to $5
billion since the Navy hopes to buy 125 of the new planes.
   The Navy, in a brief statement, said Lockheed had bested two
large competitors and been awarded a contract to develop a new,
modernized version of its P-3C Orion sub-hunter.
   The P-3, a military version of Lockheed's four-propeller Electra
passenger airplane of the 1950s, has been used by the Navy as its
long-range submarine patrol craft since 1962.
   The four-turboprop Orion carries a crew of 10, an array of
sonobuoys and other detection equipment and MK-46 torpedoes. It
operates from shore bases and has a range of more than 2,700 miles.
   Despite the plane's longevity and various upgrades through the
decades, the Navy has been trying to replace the Orion for more
than five years. The service argues it needs a more reliable and
more capable airplane based on the latest technology in order to
counter Soviet gains in submarine warfare.
   Until last year, the Navy's efforts to start a new program had
been blocked either by Defense Department officials or
congressional leaders, mainly on cost grounds.
   But the service finally won authorization in 1987 to launch a
program and solicit bids on an entirely new anti-submarine airplane
that it designated the LRAACA _ or Long-Range Air Anti-submarine
warfare Capability Aircraft.
   Eventually, the Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. decided
to challenge Lockheed and submit proposals. Boeing proposed a
military derivative of its twin-jet 757 transport, while McDonnell
Douglas proposed a derivative of an MD-87 airliner with a new
technology engine known as the ultra high bypass, unducted fan.
   Industry officials had said before Friday's announcement that
McDonnell Douglas would have difficulty winning because the new
propfan engine wasn't expected to be ready early enough to suit the
Navy's schedule, narrowing the real competition to Boeing and
Lockheed.
   Lockheed, which has built more than 500 Orions for the Navy over
the years and dozens more for foreign allies, responded with what
it described as a ``modernized version of the P-3'' that would be
equipped with a new, more fuel efficient turbo prop engine and
five-bladed, non-metal propellers.
   The new engines, built by the General Electric Co., will cut
fuel consumption by 25 percent, Lockheed said. The company also
argued that by sticking with the basic P-3, the Navy could ``take
advantage of commonality with (the) existing P-3 support structure
to reduce program cost.''
   The Navy did not offer any explanation on Friday why it selected
Lockheed over Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
   The Navy did say that Lockheed had submitted the lowest bid, but
added it also had considered such factors as life-cycle costs;
compliance with technical requirements; and logistic support in
judging the bids.
   The Navy said it expected the Defense Acquisition Board to
review the program in December, hopefully clearing the way for
full-scale development. The Navy expects the first prototype to fly
in September 1991, with production deliveries beginning in 1994.
   The ``fly-away cost estimate'' for each plane is $39.1 million,
the Navy said.
   ``We're delighted with the Navy's selection,'' said Jim
Ragsdale, a Lockheed spokesman in Burbank, Calif.
   ``It represents a program that Lockheed has worked very hard to
win over the past year, and it represents an opportunity to
continue a long history of more than 50 years of pioneering
maritime patrol aircraft.''
   Despite the Navy's announcement, the future of the new patrol
aircraft is anything but certain. Congress still could withhold an
appropriation to start full-scale production, or the Navy may have
to shift its weapon priorities because of expected budget cuts.

   A gloomy trade report continued to take its toll
on the dollar Friday, as dealers shed more of the U.S. currency in
favor of other foreign money.
   Gold prices headed higher. Republic National Bank in New York
quoted gold at $409 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $406.70
Thursday.
   Traders said that Thursday's trade report, which showed a
widening $12.18 billion gap in August, vs. a revised $9.47 billion
July shortfall, prolonged the bearish sentiment toward the dollar.
   Economic indicators released Friday also provided no help,
traders said. Retail sales fell 0.2 percent in September from a
revised fall of 0.1 percent in August, while producer prices rose
0.4 percent in September from an unrevised figure of 0.6 percent in
August.
   Traders said reports of soft economic growth, coupled with the
upcoming election, make the dollar a lot less attractive these days.
   ``I don't find any reasons to buy dollars and I believe most of
the market feels that way, too,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a trader
for Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   Dan Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. in New York, said the
absence of any central-bank intervention to prop up the dollar also
contributed to its decline Friday.
   ``It seems the central banks would prefer it lower,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.27 yen to a closing 128.25 yen. It was
quoted lower at 127.985 yen in London. Later, in New York, the
dollar stood at 127.53 yen, up from 127.425.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7550 to buy one pound, more than $1.7470 late Thursday. Sterling
fetched $1.75975 in New York, up from $1.7505 Thursday.
   Other later dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.80395 West German marks, down from 1.81525;
1.5243 Swiss francs, down from 1.5318; 1.2048 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.20745; 6.1765 French francs, down from 6.1880; and
1,344.75 Italian lire, down from 1,351.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, vs. late Thursday: 1.8128 West
German marks, down from 1.8193; 1.5305 Swiss francs, down from
1.5390; 6.1945 French francs, down from 6.1995; 2.0470 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0475; 1,352.50 Italian lire, down from
1,354.00; 1.2048 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2084
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose to $409.10 a troy ounce from $406.90 Thursday. Earlier in
London it rose $2.40 to $409.10; in Zurich it rose $2.10 to
$406.50; and in Hong Kong it fell $1.40 to $409.82.
   Silver prices were higher. On the New York Comex silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $6.365 a troy ounce from $6.303
Thursday. In London it gained 4 cents to $6.33 an ounce.

   A group of oil ministers will try
again this weekend to fashion what has become an ever-elusive
strategy to boost sagging oil prices.
   Sunday's meeting here of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which
includes ministers from six Persian Gulf nations, comes amid a
backdrop of price-war threats and rollercoaster prices that
sometimes have dropped as much as $8 below the $18-a-barrel
benchmark for crude.
   In New York, speculation that OPEC members would agree on
production cuts sent prices soaring Friday in the oil futures
market.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, shot up 71 cents a barrel to settle at
$14.92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract had
briefly traded below $12.30 a barrel as recently as last week.
   ``Within the GCC, we must have one strategy, one oil policy,''
said GCC Secretary-General Abdullah Bishara of Kuwait.
   GCC members include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Oman. With the exception of Bahrain and Oman,
each nation is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   OPEC has been trying to reign in production by its 13 member
states in an effort to boost oil prices.
   Oil industry executives estimate that during August, GCC nations
along with Iran and Iraq accounted for 13 million barrels a day of
OPEC's 20-million-barrel daily output. Had the nations adhered to
their designated OPEC production quotas, the outflow would have
been 10.5 million barrels a day.
   Iraq and Iran ignored their OPEC quotas to finance their
8-year-old war. Although a cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20,
both sides have insisted they be allowed to produce as much as
needed to finance reconstruction.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Gulf states ``will have to find some way of helping Iran and Iraq,
otherwise they will just keep producing.''
   Iraq has hinted it will accept an OPEC production ceiling to
bolster prices. It is producing about 2.7 million barrels a day
against a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day. Iran's output is
pegged at about 2.5 million barrels a day, slightly above its
2.36-million-barrel quota. Damage to its facilities prevents higher
output.
   Within the the GCC, the Emirates has publicly set its ceiling at
1.5 million barrels daily, compared to its 948,000-barrel quota.
Oil industry analysts have said Kuwait is also above its OPEC mark.
And Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter and OPEC's most
influential member, has served notice that it will no longer play
``swing producer'' by decreasing its own output to balance
overproduction of others.
   The kingdom said this month it had lost $109 billion over the
years in attempting to shore up prices.
   Saudi sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer will submit a plan to restore
``balance and stability to the oil market.''
   The kingdom has stressed it backs OPEC and is ready to abide by
quotas if other members do, but observers say its threats to
increase production is a pressure tactic to get others in line.
   A Western diplomat noted that ``as long as others are cheating
on their quotas, Saudi Arabia will too. ...They're not looking to
start a price war, but they are looking to defend their market
share.''
   The day after the Saudis' Oct. 3 announcement, crude prices
dropped to a 26-month low. ``It takes what the Saudis have done to
get everybody back in line,'' said an industry source here.
   In 1983, the Saudis cut back their oil production to help
stabilize prices but lost so much market share that two years
later, they resorted to net-back pricing _ pegging crude prices to
the value of refined products. Other producers followed suit and
oil prices collapsed. In early 1987, OPEC countries halted net-back
pricing and briefly drove up prices.
   The pro-government media has been lashing out at OPEC. The
English-language Riyadh Daily referred to the cartel as ``another
motley organization whose members are perenially at
cross-purposes.''
   Prices have edged back up since the Saudi announcement, and
analysts have said a cold winter might also help raise prices if
the demand for heating oil increases.
   Some sources say quotas may be increased to bring the current
ceiling of 15.06 million barrels daily more closely in line with
actual production of about 20 million barrels daily. A full OPEC
meeting has been scheduled for Nov. 21 in Vienna.

   Biogen Inc. finally turned the corner in
the unsteady genetic research industry Friday, reporting its first
quarterly profit after racking up more than $100 million in losses
since its founding 10 years ago.
   It was the first time that Biogen, one of the nations' earliest
biotechnology start-ups, has been in the black since going public
in 1983.
   Analysts said a major restructuring that emphasized the
marketing of new drug and disease-testing procedures has helped
Biogen transform a $6.99 million loss in the 1987 third quarter
into a modest profit of $361,000, or 2 cents a share, in this
year's quarter.
   ``This is the first turnaround story in the biotechnology
sector,'' said Viren Mehta, a vice president at S.G. Warburg Co. in
New York.
   The good news comes at a time when biotech stocks have been
slumping. Shares of industry leader Genentech Inc. of San Francisco
were trading at $44 at the end of last year but since have fallen
to about $17.
   For 1987, Biogen lost $22.6 million on revenues of $12.5
million. But revenue spiked upward this year. In the third quarter,
revenue totaled $9.8 million, up from $2.69 million a year ago. And
for the first nine months of the year, revenue jumped to $23.8
million from $9.5 million a year ago.
   ``This gives us a lot more flexibility in how we run the
business day to day,'' said Biogen Vice President and Treasurer
Jack Catterall. ``It's no longer crisis management.''
   In over-the-counter trading Friday, Biogen rose 25 cents to
$8.12{ a share.
   Founded by Nobel Prize-winning Harvard University scientist
Walter Gilbert and others in 1978, Biogen spent millions on diverse
and costly genetic research projects and lost $101 million in the
process.
   ``Biogen started as a very high flier,'' said Andrew McVeigh, an
analyst with Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in Chicago. ``Over time it lost
its cache. It's fair to say they had management problems.''
   Three years ago, the company brought in businessman Jim Vincent
of Abbott Laboratories as its chairman, who is credited with
trimming fat and engineering a major restructuring last year.
   In the shakeup, Biogen sold off research facilities in
Switzerland and Belgium, cut expenses, refocused research and
development on marketable products and retained rights to new
products rather than licensing them out.
   ``The major difference ... is (Biogen) is now being managed from
a more commercial and less technical perspective,'' said Biogen
co-founder Phillip Sharp, director of the Center for Cancer
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Clinical trials began this week at two hospitals of a new AIDS
drug called CD4 developed by Biogen scientists that doctors hope
will act as a decoy to attract the lethal virus. But competitor
Genentech began clinical testing of a version of the drug several
weeks ago.
   Biogen also expects approval in West Germany for genetically
engineered gamma interferon for treatment of severe rheumatoid
arthritis. It has an edge in hepatitis research thanks to a broad
patent based on research by one of its founders.
   Biogen recently developed and licensed a diagnostic test and
vaccine for hepatitis B, a swine growth promoter that could help
farmers raise leaner pigs, and the anti-cancer drug alpha
interferon that is sold in 43 foreign countries.
   Despite a rosier financial picture, analysts said Biogen still
must prove that its new drugs and procedures can succeed in the
marketplace.

   The stock market rode out alternating waves of
buying and selling to finish little changed Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 14 points in
early trading and down about 11 at its afternoon low, closed with a
.18 loss at 2,133.18.
   For the week the average was down 17.07 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in the
daily tally of nationwide trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 740 up, 647 down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.24 million
shares, up from 154.53 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 188.61 million shares.
   Analysts said the rise at the outset was blunted by weakness in
the dollar and an upswing in interest rates, which had fallen in
early activity.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price index rose 0.4 percent in September. That was in line with
advance estimates on Wall Street.
   Meanwhile, figures showing flat industrial production and a 0.4
percent drop in retail sales last month provided support for the
belief that economic growth was slowing to a more moderate, and
presumably more sustainable, pace.
   Brokers also said traders drew some encouragement from a
favorable International Business Machines earnings report.
   IBM climbed 1[ to 119} in active trading after the company
posted third-quarter profits of $2.10 a share, up from $2 in the
comparable period last year.
   John Akers, the company's chairman, said, ``Worldwide demand is
strong across our product line.''
   Hospital Corp. of America gained 3} to 48\. A management group
raised its offer to buy out the company from $47 a share to $51 a
share.
   Wickes Cos. tumbled 3\ to 7]. A group of executives said it
planned to withdraw a $12-a-share bid for Wickes stock, citing a
deterioration in the company's operating income.
   Polaroid rose 2[ to 40. Brokers cited speculation that the
company, which is the subject of a $42-a-share takeover bid by Roy
Disney's Shamrock Holdings, might soon attract a rival offer or
offers.
   Sears Roebuck, which had been bid up of late on talk of a
possible restructuring or other deal, fell back 1] to 41.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.17 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .12 to 155.46.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.38 to 316.70, and

   Food costs, showing further effects from the
drought, accelerated sharply in September, but a big drop in energy
costs kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at a moderate 0.4
percent, the government reported Friday.
   The price report brought smiles at the White House, where the
Reagan administration claimed it showed inflation was not heating
up. But some private economists expressed worries about what could
happen if world oil prices suddenly rebound.
   The September increase represented a drop from an August
increase of 0.6 percent. For the first nine months, wholesale
prices have been rising at a rate of 4.3 percent.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the inflation
report showed a ``clear downward trend'' indicating inflation was
under control.
   The government also reported Friday that retail sales fell for
the second straight month in September, declining 0.4 percent
because of weakness in auto sales.
   In another sign that the economy was slowing, the Federal
Reserve said the operating rate for America's factories, mines and
utilities was unchanged in September, the first month industrial
production has failed to increase since last February.
   The financial markets took the data in stride. Stock prices rode
out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little
changed, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing 0.18
to close at 2,133.18. An initial rally in the bond market ran out
of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose. Bonds finished
slightly higher.
   In the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail
sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the
economy was not in danger of overheating.
   Those worries earlier in the year had prompted the Federal
Reserve, in an inflation-fighting move, to tighten credit
conditions and push interest rates higher.
   ``The good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked
and should decline in coming months,'' said Richard Rahn, chief
economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The bad news is not
all that bad. The economy is slowing, but only slightly.''
   Other economists agreed, although some said they were worried
that the underlying inflation rate, after removing the volatile
food and energy categories, jumped by 0.6 percent in September,
double the rate of increase in August.
   Some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to
wait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election and then resume
pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen
consumer demand.
   The big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 3.3
percent drop in energy costs, the biggest decline since January.
All fuel categories showed decreases. Gasoline costs fell 3.3
percent, natural gas dropped 2.5 percent and home heating oil
declined by 4.6 percent.
   The price declines reflected the current battle among
oil-producing nations over production quotas.
   Offsetting the drop in energy costs, food prices jumped by 1.2
percent last month, three times the rate of increase in August,
serving notice to consumers that the effects of the summer drought
have not played themselves out.
   Many economists said they expect this pattern of higher food
costs offset by declining energy prices to repeat itself for the
rest of the year.
   ``Once again we lucked out,'' said David Wyss, an economist with
Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ``Energy prices are
dropping at precisely the time we need it to balance the drought.''
   Wyss noted that declining world oil prices in 1986 had helped
cushion the inflationary impact from a drop in the value of the
dollar.
   But John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, another
economic consulting firm, said the scenario for moderate inflation
could be disrupted if OPEC countries start obeying their production
quotas and world oil prices rebound.
   ``The downward movement in oil prices could suddenly come back
to hit us if they start rising again, pushing the inflation rate
higher,'' he said.
   Much of the momentum for the September gain in food costs came
from a 4.2 percent jump in beef prices as producers ended the herd
liquidations that had depressed prices earlier in the drought cycle.
   Fruit costs jumped 10 percent, and vegetable prices shot up by
16.5 percent. Both gains were blamed on demand shortages caused by
the drought. Prices also rose for coffee and dairy products, which
both climbed 1.5 percent.
   Prices fell, however, for eggs, down 8.5 percent; pork, down 4.2
percent; and rice, down 3.6 percent.
   Another factor pushing prices higher in September was a 1.8
percent increase in new automobile prices. The report said this
reflected lower end-of-the-model-year incentives to buyers as
automakers were faced with less of an overhang of unsold cars than
they have had in past years.
   The September changes put the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index for finished goods at 108.6, meaning that a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 at wholesale in 1982 would have
cost $108.60 last month.
   The government on Oct. 21 will release its report on price
changes at the consumer level. Through August, consumer prices were
rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, only slightly higher than
the 4.4 percent gain for all of 1987.

<HEAD>Copper Surges On Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices roared to new life-of-contract highs
across the board Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange on fears
that unrest in South America could exacerbate an already tight
supply situation.
   On other markets, precious metals also advanced; energy futures
surged; grains and soybeans moved lower; livestock and meat were
mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Copper for delivery in December shot up 5.75 cents to $1.2535 a
pound and analysts said prices could reach or exceed last year's
all-time high of $1.46 if the demand for tight supplies remained
strong.
   ``Copper continues to explode,'' said Craig Sloane, metals
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It's in an
accelerating phase right now; you've got everything working for
you.''
   Major factors in the sharp rally included the possiblity of a
general strike Monday in Peru, the world's 7th largest copper
producer, and of civil unrest in Chile, the No. 1 copper country,
due to the election defeat of General Augusto Pinochet, analysts
said.
   The Commodity Exchange reported warehouse stocks of copper at
11,529 tons, down 846 tons from last week and sharply below the
approximately 80,000 tons in Comex warehouses a year earlier.
   Traders and analysts expected the London Metal Exchange to
report a drop of about 8,000 metric tons in its warehouse stocks on
Monday, Sloane said.
   Although worldwide demand from copper consumers remains strong,
the market has not seen the sort of panic buying that marked last
year's dramatic rally, Sloane said. Copper prices more than doubled
during last year but rarely have fallen below 90 cents a pound this
year.
   ``I think the market is a little bit accustomed to it, so it's
not the same kind of situation we had last year,'' Sloane said.
   Other copper contracts settled $4.35 to $4.50 higher.
   Platinum futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange but the other precious metals posted only moderate gains
in response to higher oil prices.
   The platinum market faces fairly tight supplies and was boosted
Friday by strong technical signals, Sloane said.
   Platinum settled $9.80 to $11.30 higher with October at $527.20
a troy ounce.
   On the Comex, gold was $2.10 to $2.20 higher with December at
$412.50 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.2 cents higher with
December at $6.435 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange on ideas
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was nearing
agreement on new production quotas to stabilize crude oil prices.
   Rumors suggested the overall OPEC quota would be increased,
analysts said. But if all OPEC members abided by their new quotas _
something they have not been doing recently _ total production
would be below the amount of OPEC crude oil currently being
produced.
   ``It's possible this could come to pass and, if it does, we will
see the market rally sharply, said Peter Beutel, energy analyst in
New York with Elders Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 59 cents to 71 cents
higher with November at $14.92 a barrel; heating oil was 1.46 cents
to 1.72 cents higher with November at 43.21 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .80 cent to 1.27 cents higher with November
at 45.42 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures settled moderately lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment over the failure
of U.S. and Soviet negotiators to produce a new long-term grain
agreement.
   Negotiators ended two days of talks Friday in London with no
agreement and no date for the next round of talks.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 7{ cents lower with December at $4.28}
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3{ cents lower with December at
$2.93} a bushel; oats were 5{ cents lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.52{ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents lower to { cent
higher with November at $8.04 a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, pressured by sluggish demand from packing houses and
retailers, analysts said.
   Hogs advanced in line with higher cash prices while frozen pork
bellies declined on profit-taking.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .47 cent lower with October at
72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .53 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with October at 82 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent
lower to .65 cent higher with October at 40.42 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .27 cent to .45 cent lower with February
at 49 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures were nearly unchanged on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the December Standard & Poor's 500
contract settled .10 point lower at 276.90.

   Xidex Corp. is closing a plant in suburban
Irvine that makes computer disks, putting 825 employees out of
work, a spokeswoman said Friday.
   The company laid off 180 workers last week and furloughed 645
Thursday and Friday, said Jo McKee, a spokeswoman for Anacomp Inc.,
Xidex's parent company in Indianapolis.
   Xidex, a maker of hard disks used to store information in
computers, is consolidating production of rigid oxide disks _ the
type made at Irvine _ at its 1,800-employee Santa Clara plant,
McKee said.
   She said about 40 of the Irvine employees would be offered
transfers to Santa Clara.
   The move was made in view of softening demand for the rigid
oxide disks and forecasts they will be replaced by newer
technology, McKee said.
   Xidex was bought six weeks ago by Anacomp, which produces
computer equipment and software.

<HEAD>Bond Prices End Flat to Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished unchanged to slightly
higher Friday in volatile trading, as an early rally inspired by
new economic reports ran out of steam.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose about 3-16
point, or $1.87 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction and is often an indicator of
interest rate trends, slipped to 8.90 percent from 8.92 percent
late Thursday.
   The yield on the key 30-year issue reached as low as 8.80
percent and as high as 8.94 percent during the session.
   Prices surged early in the trading day on the strength of
government reports suggesting moderate growth and tame inflation,
analysts said.
   They said the market was influenced largely by a Labor
Department report that showed wholesale prices, a key inflation
component, rose only 0.4 percent in September, restrained by
sharply falling energy prices.
   The report suggested that inflation, which erodes the value of
fixed-income investments, is not as significant a threat as earlier
feared.
   In other reports, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
an unexpected 0.4 percent in September, suggesting a decline in
consumer demand, another important inflation component.
   At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board said industrial
production was unchanged in September, an indication that economic
growth is moderating and further easing inflationary pressures.
   Analysts said bond prices later retreated, however, in response
to a steep decline in the dollar against other major currencies and
a rise in oil prices.
   ``We took a beating,'' said Kevin Flanagan, a money-market
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   A weakening of the dollar tends to erode the value of bonds and
notes denominated in the U.S. currency, while rising oil prices
rekindle fears of inflation.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities were flat to 1-16 point higher, and long-term issues
rose 5-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was up 0.43 at 1,150.28.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also rose.
Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, edged up 0.35 to 294.96.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, slipped to 7.55
percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 7.32 percent. Yields
on six-month bills rose to 7.78 percent as the discount edged up 1
basis point to 7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills declined to
8.03 percent as the discount slipped 1 basis point to 7.50 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8[ percent, up from 81-16
percent late Thursday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing machinists at Eastern
Airlines filed a request Friday to examine all documents related to
the planned $365 million sale of the carrier's Northeast air
shuttle to developer Donald Trump.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers asked U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker to reopen
discovery in a suit in which the union charges that Eastern's sale
of various assets is part of an effort to undermine the strength of
organized labor.
   ``Eastern's present plan to dispose of the air shuttle
constitutes its latest effort to undermine the status of its
unions,'' the machinists said in papers filed in U.S. District
Court.
   The union said it needed to examine the sale documents in order
to prepare a request for a preliminary injunction to stop the deal
from being completed.
   The motion noted that the shuttle operation, which serves New
York, Boston and Washington, is the only profitable section of
ailing Eastern.
   Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's
parent, said earlier this week he expects the sale to be completed
by Dec. 15. Besides the planned court challenge by the machinists,
the acquisition also must undergo scrutiny by the Department of
Transportation.

<HEAD>Honeywell Sues Unisys For More Than $350 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. has filed a $350 million
lawsuit against Unisys Corp. accusing the giant computer
manufacturer of artificially inflating the financial strength of
four aerospace operations that Honeywell purchased from Unisys for
more than $1 billion in 1986.
   Unisys filed a similar suit in New York City in September,
seeking $565,000 it said was due under the sales agreement.
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, the
Minneapolis manufacturing firm accuses Unisys of refusing to
provide more detailed financial information when Honeywell sought
it in 1986.
   Honeywell said it had to rely on financial statements issued in
September and October 1986, which the suit says overstated the
assets and income of the aerospace operations.
   The aerospace stations purchased by Honeywell were owned by
Sperry Corp. before it merged in 1986 with Burroughs Corp. to form
Unisys, now based in Blue Bell, Pa., and Detroit.
   Honeywell already has taken a $27 million write-off for what it
said were unrecoverable contract costs. Last month Honeywell
announced there would be further write-offs in the quarter that
ended Sept. 30. It has not yet announced its financial results for
that quarter.
   Unisys issued a statement Friday from its Blue Bell
headquarters, saying it believed the Honeywell suit should be
settled in New York Supreme Court, where Unisys earlier filed its
suit. The company said the sales agreement was negotiated and
performed in New York and it specified New York law would apply to
all claims.
   Unisys also claimed Honeywell's lawyers, accountants and
investment bankers had the chance to review fully all financial and
operating records of Sperry in 1986. Unisys added it believes it
has strong factual and legal defenses to Honeywell's suit, although
it did not respond to the specific claims.
   Unisys said it filed its suit after receiving notice from
Honeywell regarding claims Honeywell was asserting against Unisys
relating to the sale. The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment as
to the rights and obligations of Unisys and Honeywell relating to
the sales transaction.
   Honeywell's suit, which seeks more than $350 million, alleges
violations of federal and state securities laws, fraudulent
misrepresentation and breach of warranty. It asks for a jury trial.
   Some of the claims against Unisys were that it concealed losses
of at least $36 million on 10 fixed-price contracts, failed to
report an additional loss of $12 million on one of those contracts
and of $1 million on five others, that it did not report a drop in
value of $2.4 million for one poorly performing operation and that
it overvalued assets by more than $54 million.

<HEAD>Marshals Throw Legal Net over Big Haul Of Rotting Seafood</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal marshals threw a legal net over more than
1.3 million pounds of rotting and rodent-infested seafood at a
northwest suburban warehouse, the U.S. attorney's office said
Friday.
   Marshals sealed freezers containing about $2.5 million worth of
seafood at Impex Shrimp and Fish Co. after U.S. Food and Drug
Administration inspectors found rodent feces and infestation, as
well as decomposition, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney
Frederick Branding.
   Impex distributes seafood nationally, he said.
   The seafood, seized under a warrant, included scallops, lobster
tails, shrimp, frog legs, cod, sole and red snapper, Branding said.
   There had been no reports of the tainted seafood's reaching
consumers, he said.
   FDA District Director Raymond Mlecko said there was no health
hazard involved.
   ``You cannot get sick from eating it,'' Mlecko said.
   The owner of Impex, Bernard Kane, was not available immediately
for comment Friday afternoon, his office manager said.
   According to a complaint filed before U.S. District Judge John
Nordberg, the seized items ``consist in part of a filthy substance
because they contain rodent fecal pellets, and consist in whole or
in part of a putrid or decomposed substance.''
   FDA investigators discovered unsanitary conditions in a
30,000-square-foot freezer warehouse during a recent inspection,
Branding said.
   If the company protests the seizure, a court hearing will be
held so the company can present evidence that the fish is not
contaminated and is salvageable, he said.
   Impex cannot sell or move any of the alleged contaminated
products without court permission, Branding said.
   Some of the seafood was imported from Mexico, but the products
``came from all over,'' he said.
   Investigators believe the seafood might have been decomposing
when it arrived in Elk Grove Village, Branding said.
   The federal court complaint seeks to have th fish destroyed at
Impex's expense.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge in Delaware on Friday
denied an attempt by Polaroid Corp. to block a hostile takeover bid
by the Disney family-owned Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   U.S. District Judge Caleb Wright ruled that Polaroid had proven
no ``reasonable probability of success'' if the case had gone to
trial or irreparable damage from Shamrock's $42-a-share offer. He
refused to issue a temporary injunction against the bid.
   The decision keeps alive the takeover effort by Shamrock, the
Burbank, Calif.-based television and radio concern wholly owned by
the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew of the late animator.
   Rumors circulated on Wall Street Friday that Forstmann Little &
Co., a New York leveraged buyout concern, was about to make its own
offer for Polaroid for $46 a share. Forstmann Little was rebuffed
in August when it approached Polaroid about a friendly takeover.
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips declined to comment on the
new rumor.
   ``We are delighted that the federal court has ruled in our
favor,'' Shamrock president Stanley P. Gold said in a statement.
   ``Now that one of the roadblocks Polaroid sought to erect to
prevent Polaroid stockholders from accepting our premium cash
tender offer has been eliminated, we are hopeful that Polaroid will
reconsider its decision not to meet with us,'' he said.
   The instant camera pioneer filed the suit last month seeking to
block Shamrock from acquiring any additional shares of the company
that introduced instant snapshots in 1948 and compel it to divest
of its current 5 million shares.
   ``Polaroid attorneys are studying the decision of Judge Wright
to deny the company's motion for a preliminary injunction against
Shamrock's tender offer and will determine the next steps,''
Polaroid said in a statement.
   The decision does not affect a trial scheduled to begin
Wednesday in Delaware Court of Chancery on Shamrock's lawsuit
against Polaroid's recently issued employee stock ownership plan.
Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   Shamrock on Friday also extended its $42 a share tender offer
for Polaroid until October 27. The offer was to expire on Monday.
   Shamrock was rebuffed in an unsolicited takeover bid before
making a sweetened hostile offer last month that values Polaroid at
$2.6 billion. Polaroid said the offer was too low and advised
shareholders to reject it.
   Polaroid stock rose $2.12{ to $40 in consolidated New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday.
   A major point of controversy between the companies is Polaroid's
employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, which places 14 percent of
company stock in employee hands. Shamrock has refused to recognize
the ESOP.
   Employees are paying for the shares with a 5 percent pay cut.
Polaroid had to borrow $285 million to fund the $300 million ESOP.
   Polaroid asked the federal court in Wilmington, Del., to issue a
temporary injunction against what it called a ``manipulative,
deceptive and materially false'' tender offer.
   Attorneys for Polaroid maintained Shamrock violated securities
laws because its offer was not extended to all valid shares, and
did not include its investment bankers, Wertheim, Schroder & Co.
and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., as co-bidders.
   Polaroid attorneys said the investment houses would obtain $100
million in stock, or 21 percent control of Polaroid, for $46
million. But Shamrock said the investment bankers only brought the
deal to Shamrock's attention and the 21 percent stake was part of a
fee arrangement.
   Analysts were not surprised by the judge's decision.
   ``I think that was basically expected. That was a normal move
for Polaroid or any company under attack to do _ to accuse a
pursuer of securities violations,'' said Polaroid analyst Eugene
Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

   The latest bid of $3.6 billion to the
Hospital Corporation of America by an investor group may be the
highest offer the company gets, a broker said Friday.
   The offer this week of $51 a share in cash and securities for
HCA's 70.6 million outstanding shares comes after a special
committee last week rejected the group's initial $47 a share cash
offer.
   ``HCA may not be able to risk a subsequent rejection,'' said a
stock broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Nashville, who spoke
only on condition that he not be identified. ``This is probably the
highest bid that HCA is going to get. I think they will consider it
seriously. They have an obligation to their shareholders to
consider such offers,'' he said.
   The latest offer would pay $43 in cash plus securities the group
valued at $8 for each HCA share. The group also has commitments for
all the debt and equity financing needed to complete the buyout,
the company said in a news release.
   HCA officials refused to comment on the offer or other details
regarding the proposal.
   ``Our attorneys have instructed us not to comment past the news
release,'' said David McFadden, director of corporate relations for
HCA. ``Our next comment will be in the form of a news release.''
   The offer is valid until 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday and is subject to
the approval of shareholders and the HCA board of directors.
   A special committee of independent directors of the board is
expected to meet some time next week to consider the proposal.
   The special committee on Oct. 6 rejected a $3.3 billion
leveraged buyout proposal from the group, led by HCA Chairman
Thomas F. Frist Jr.
   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide, set
up the special committee to consider buyout offers when the first
one was proposed in mid-September.
   The company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over
a year ago to a new employee-owned company, HealthTrust Inc.

   Food costs, showing further effects from the
drought, accelerated sharply in September, but a big drop in energy
costs kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at a moderate 0.4
percent, the government reported.
   The Reagan administration claimed that Friday's report showed
inflation was not heating up. But some private economists expressed
worries about what could happen if world oil prices suddenly
rebound.
   The September increase represented a drop from an August
increase of 0.6 percent.

   Retail sales in September dropped for the
second consecutive month, the government said, confirming
economists' views that the confidence of U.S. consumers is slipping.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that sales fell 0.4 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted $133.7 billion. That followed a
dip of 0.1 percent in August and was the first back-to-back drop
since September-October 1987.
   The government data is consistent with a survey earlier this
week for The Conference Board, a business research organization.

   U.S. industrial production in September failed
to rise for the first time in seven months, the government said,
suggesting to economists that the overheated manufacturing sector
is cooling a bit.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Friday that output at the
nation's facories, mines and utilities was unchanged last month
after increasing a slight 0.2 percent in August and an unusually
large 1.2 percent in July.
   The production index has gone 12 months without a decline, but
September was the first time since February that it did not rise.

   Federal regulators pledged $1.3 billion to
rescue 11 insolvent savings institutions in Texas, selling them to
a cable television company.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday that Adam
Corporation@Group of Bryant, Texas, a cable TV station operator, is
investing $65 million now and an additional $15 million by the end
of 1990 to acquire the 11 institutions.
   They are being merged under the name of Olney Savings and Loan
Association. All deposits, even those over the insurance limit of
$100,000, are transferring, the bank board said.

   Revenue climbed 5.3 percent, an indication that IBM is

computers without a big drop in sales of older models, analysts
said Friday.
   ``They (earnings) were pretty decent,'' said Steven Cohen, an

   Allegheny International Inc. said it still
intends to emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization by year's end or
early in 1989 even though the parties in the case have asked for a
month's delay in a key hearing.
   ``It's very common for large claims to be made, but they are
ultimately settled for significantly less,'' company spokesman
Edward Romanoff said Friday.
   Earlier, company officials told Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti
that they need time to study $2.5 billion in claims pending against
the consumer products company.

   President Reagan signed into law a bill aimed
at spurring the manufacture of vehicles that can run on fuels other
than gasoline.
   ``This bill is a landmark in the quest for alternative forms of
energy,'' Reagan said Friday.
   The legislation has been billed by its supporters as providing a
means of lowering U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cutting pollution
and curbing the nation's trade deficit.

   The Japanese yen is strong and the dollar is

lesson in international economics at the fish counter.
   ``It's outrageous,'' said John Russell of Pure Food Fish in
Seattle's Pike Place Market. Fresh chinook, or king, salmon steaks
and filets that sold a year ago for $4.95 and $5.95 a pound now run
$7.95 to $8.95, Russell said Friday.
   The bad news for consumers has been good news for Northwest
fishermen, who have been netting many more dollars for the same

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has signaled that
the new hope for producing more food is in the hands of farmers,
not the collective system built with the blood of millions of
Soviets.
   In a major speech published Friday on the front pages of Soviet
newspapers, Gorbachev didn't say outright that collectivization was
a mistake and should be scrapped.
   But his stress was no longer on the collectively run farms or on
those owned and operated by the state. They have been the backbone
of Soviet agriculture since the late 1920s.

<HEAD>Lower Fuel Costs Offset Sharply Higher Food Costs in September</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A large drop in energy costs in September outweighed sharply
higher food prices and kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at
a moderate 0.4 percent, the government reported.
   While the Reagan administration lauded Friday's report as signs
that inflation was not heating up, some private economists
expressed worries about what could happen if world oil prices
suddenly rebound.
   The September increase represented a drop from an August
increase of 0.6 percent. For the first nine months, wholesale
prices have been rising at a rate of 4.3 percent.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the inflation
report showed a ``clear downward trend'' indicating inflation was
under control.
   The government also reported Friday that retail sales fell for
the second straight month in September, declining 0.4 percent
because of weakness in auto sales.
   In another sign that the economy was slowing, the Federal
Reserve said the operating rate for America's factories, mines and
utilities was unchanged in September, the first month industrial
production has failed to increase since last February.
   The financial markets took the data in stride. Stock prices rode
out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little
changed, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing 0.18
to close at 2,133.18. An initial rally in the bond market ran out
of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose.
   In the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail
sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the
economy was not in danger of overheating.
   Those worries earlier in the year had prompted the Federal
Reserve, in an inflation-fighting move, to tighten credit
conditions and push interest rates higher.
   ``The good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked
and should decline in coming months,'' said Richard Rahn, chief
economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The bad news is not
all that bad. The economy is slowing, but only slightly.''
   Other economists agreed, although some said they were worried
that the underlying inflation rate, after removing the volatile
food and energy categories, jumped by 0.6 percent in September,
double the rate of increase in August.
   Some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to
wait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election and then resume
pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen
consumer demand.
   The big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 3.3
percent drop in energy costs, the biggest decline since January and
a reflection of the rrent battle among oil-producing nations over
production quotas.
   Offsetting the drop in energy costs, food prices jumped by 1.2
percent last month, three times the rate of increase in August.
Another factor pushing prices higher was a 1.8 percent increase in
new automobile prices.

   Oil futures prices have leaped again in reaction
to speculation that OPEC oil producers would reach an agreement on
production cuts at meetings this coming week.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 71 cents Friday to settle at $14.92 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Since Tuesday, the November contract has leaped $1.37 a barrel,
reflecting a sharp turnaround in the mood of the market.
   A proposal on the table would cut production by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to between 18.5
million and 19.5 million barrels a day, said Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   OPEC's production recently has been about 21 million barrels a
day even though the official ceiling is about 19 million barrels.
   ``It's not a fait accompli,'' said Beutel, who said he got his
information from sources. ``These numbers may not come into
existence.''
   Oil traders pushed prices so high in anticipation of an OPEC
accord that if one fails to materialize, prices could fall back
quite rapidly, analysts said.
   The heaviest buying Friday was by traders who had speculated on
a decline in prices and were forced to bail out when the market
turned against them, said Jayne Ball, a trader and analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes four
OPEC members, is scheduled to meet Sunday in Saudi Arabia. On
Thursday, OPEC's price monitoring committee and long-term strategy
committee are scheduled to meet jointly in Madrid.
   The price of oil skidded in recent weeks _ trading below $12.30
a barrel at one point last week _ because of continued
overproduction by cartel members, and OPEC is trying to construct
an agreement that will lower output and push prices higher.
   In other trading on the exchange Friday, the November contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.27 cents to 45.42 cents a
gallon. The November contract for home heating oil rose 1.46 cents
to settle at 43.21 cents a gallon.
