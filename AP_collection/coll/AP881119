<HEAD>State Party Leaders Urge Kirk To Stay As National Chairman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The post-election meeting of Democratic state
party leaders is turning into a Paul Kirk tribute.
   Throughout the opening session Friday of a two-day meeting of the
Association of State Democratic Chairs, party leaders appealed to
Kirk to serve another four years as national party chairman.
   ``We need you,'' former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt told Kirk
at a luncheon in his honor.
   Babbitt turned to Kirk's wife, Gail, and said, ``You have only
one husband to give to your party and, damn it, we need him for
another four years.''
   When Kirk rose to address the association at a post luncheon
meeting, the state party leaders chanted, ``Four more years, four
more years.''
   ``We must urge him and, if need be, draft him for another term,''
said Sam Shipley, the Delaware Democratic Party chairman.
   But Kirk gave the party officials no encouragement, except to say
he would not make a decision until after Thanksgiving.
   ``Four years is a long time,'' he said. ``Eight years is twice as
long.''
   Waiting in the wings should Kirk step down in February when his
four-year term ends were five contenders for the post _ four of whom
said they would not run if Kirk agrees to serve a second term.
   The one exception was Ron Brown, a Washington lawyer and former
party official, who was convention manager for Jesse Jackson.
   ``Obviously, it changes the equation tremendously,'' he said when
asked what he would do if Kirk agreed to seek another term.
   Many party officials have said they oppose Brown because of his
tie to Jackson.
   ``Jesse's a friend,'' said Brown. ``I'm proud of the role I
played in the Jackson campaign ... but I'm my own person, not his
person.''
   The other potential contenders for the party leadership post were
Rick Wiener, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party and president
of the state chairs association, and former congressmen Michael
Barnes of Maryland, James Jones of Oklahoma and Jim Stanton of Ohio.
   Kirk urged the Democrats to avoid divisive battles, ``region
against region, left against right, constituency against
constituency.''
   He cited Democratic gains in 1988 elections for state and local
offices and said, ``There is no Republican mandate.''
   The Democrats have lost five of the last six presidential
elections, but Kirk urged the party not to ``fall into the trap of
thinking we must change everything we've done in order to win the
next presidential election.''
   There was sentiment at the meeting for re-examining, once again,
the party rules for selecting presidential nominees.
   ``We need to visit that process,'' said John Baker, Alabama party
chairman, who added he wasn't certain what, if any, changes ought to
be made.
   Barnes suggested he thought changes made at the 1988 convention
as part of a compromise with Jackson might be rescinded.
   One of those changes reduced the future influence of party and
elected officials at conventions.
   ``We want to get elected officials, people with constituencies,
up front in the nominating process,'' said the former congressman.

<HEAD>House Speaker Says Bush Seeks Alternative Policy Toward Nicaragua</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush is searching for an
alternative policy toward Nicaragua that could form the basis for a
more unified U.S. foreign policy than has existed during the Reagan
administration, says House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Wright held a 1{-hour luncheon for Bush on Friday at the Capitol
during which the two men agreed on the need for cooperative
solutions to foreign policy problems and to the federal budget
deficit.
   Speaking to reporters afterward, Wright said he found Bush
anxious to establish regular lines of communication with
congressional leaders and realistic in facing up to the nation's
problems.
   ``He is quite earnestly interested in the realities of the
deficit,'' Wright, D-Texas, told reporters. ``He has no illusions
... He is prepared to do the serious things necessary to cope with
them.''
   Wright also said he was encouraged that there would be a basis
for bipartisanship in foreign policy, and he singled out Nicaragua _
a bone of contention throughout Reagan's presidency _ as a
particular bright spot.
   ``I'm encouraged to believe that there is a search for a policy
that will be acceptable both to the president and to the Congress,''
Wright said. ``I would be willing to help in that search to the
extent that my help is wanted.''
   Bush has spoken vaguely during the campaign about continuing
support for the Contra rebels, the ``freedom fighters'' whom Reagan
made the centerpiece of his approach to Central America. But Bush
has never said clearly whether he would seek renewed military aid
for the rebels, who now are essentially reduced to refugee status.
   However, ABC News reported Friday that the Bush transition team
has drafted a working paper indicating the president-elect would
discontinue efforts to win lethal aid for the Contras from Congress
and instead focus on diplomatic pursuits.
   On the economic agenda, Wright said Bush had spoken positively of
the National Economic Commission, the group now at work on solutions
to the nation's debt problems.
   That seemed to be at odds with Bush's campaign rhetoric. The vice
president had described the commission as a subterfuge to usher in
tax increases, which he had vowed would not happen. At the luncheon,
such comments were moderated, Wright said.
   ``He said he recognized the important work of the commission and
wants to work with it,'' the speaker said.
   In addition, Bush recognized the seriousness of the deficit
problem and the challenge to cut $32 billion from federal red ink to
meet deficit reduction targets, Wright said.
   ``He's not hiding from it. ... He wants to be realistic,'' Wright
said.
   Wright declined to say whether Bush had outlined specific ways to
cope with the deficit, saying only that ``he is prepared to do what
is necessary.''
   He said there was a discussion of ``methods of maintaining a
continuing dialogue'' between Congress and the White House but
declined to say whether any regular meeting schedule will be
established. Bush ``prefers to wait until he is president before he
begins to announce such things as that,'' Wright said.
   Bush's trip to Capitol Hill was a hopeful signal that the two men
would be able ``to work together in mutual respect,'' Wright said.
   ``I thought that was a good sign. It showed ... he was willing to
come halfway, rather than asking me to go down to the White House.
If you're looking for symbolism, I think it shows a willingness to
work with us.''

<HEAD>Bush Spending Weekend Mulling Cabinet Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush is spending the
weekend out of the public eye to consider Cabinet and staff
appointments before a week that will include meeting with two former
presidents, a speech to Republican governors and a session with
Mexico's new president.
   Bush on Friday reached out to Congress and to a National
Governors Association committee as he promised to complete his
economic team soon.
   He said he is working on ``fleshing out'' the economic team that
will work with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and then will move
on to his national security appointments.
   The president-elect is expected to name his current economic
adviser Richard Darman as head of the the Office of Management and
Budget, and Stanford University economist Michael J. Boskin as
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers before he leaves
Wednesday for a Thanksgiving vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   On Monday, Bush meets with former Presidents Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter, who will present him with a report entitled ``American
Agenda Report to the 41st President of the United States,''
according to a statement from the two former presidents. They
compiled the report with the help of advisers on domestic and
foreign policy issues.
   Tuesday's schedule calls for Bush to travel to Alabama to address
a group of Republican governors, then to Houston for a meeting with
Mexico's incoming president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Bush has emphasized the importance of relations with the
country's southern neighbor.
   On Friday, in anticipation of what some observers say will be a
short ``honeymoon'' with Congress, Bush and his newly named chief of
staff, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, met for lunch with House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   Bush voiced optimism for a good relationship. He told reporters,
``I meant it when I said I want to work closely with him and members
of the House of Representatives, no matter which side of the aisle
they sit on ... I want to get off to a very good start.''
   Wright, D-Texas, sounded a hopeful note for a working
relationship on ways to reduce the federal budget deficit and other
issues. He said after the meeting that Bush will have closer ties
with Congress than did President Reagan.
   He said Bush ``is quite earnestly interested in the realities of
the deficit,'' a likely contentious issue, especially given Bush's
campaign pledge not to raise taxes to cut the deficit.
   Bush's trip to Capitol Hill was ``a gesture of him being willing
to cooperate and work with Congress,'' said his transition press
secretary, Sheila Tate.
   Wright acknowledged the symbolism of Bush coming to his domain
rather than insisting the speaker go to the vice president's office.
   ``It showed ... he was willing to come halfway, rather than
asking me to go down to the White House.''
   Bush also met with a group of 18 governors and governors-elect in
Charlottesville, Va., in what he said was an effort ``to send an
early signal to the governors and the states of my interests in
working with the governors, Democrats and Republicans alike.''
   Topics included the deficit, the environment, education,
catastrophic health coverage and the National Economic Commission,
established by Congress to make recommendations on budget issues,
said Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles.

<HEAD>Justice Department Helps North's Defense By Challenging Prosecutor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department lent support to Oliver
L. North's defense by challenging the Iran-Contra prosecutor's
contention that the former presidential aide illegally subverted
Congress' role in foreign affairs.
   The department says it is not seeking dismissal of the central
charge that North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But in a friend-of-the-court brief filed Friday in federal court,
the department disputed independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's
contention that North and his co-defendants stymied congressional
oversight ``through deceit and concealment'' of their covert
operation to help the Nicaraguan rebels.
   A department official said the brief was filed only after ``much
anguish'' and with ``great reluctance.''
   Echoing statements by North and his lawyers, the department said:
``This case, in fact, arises in the context of a profound policy
dispute between the executive and legislative branches with respect
to foreign affairs.''
   ``A prosecutor acting in the midst of such a dispute must
exercise great caution _ first, to distinguish violations of law
from policy disagreements which are the expected and natural
by-product of separated powers, and to make certain that the laws
are applied consistently with the scope of the president's
substantial constitutional authority in the area of foreign
affairs.''
   Walsh's brief ``does not demonstrate sufficient caution in either
respect,'' the department said.
   The Justice Department's statement was filed in response to a
legal argument Walsh made in a brief last month that ``the entire
clandestine program in support of the Contras financed by North
aimed to defeat and obstruct the lawful functions of the Congress.''
   Walsh said the defendants conspired to defraud the government by
``deceitfully interfering with the constitutional appropriations and
oversight functions of Congress, and the policies adopted as a
result of Congress' exercise of those functions.''
   Walsh said the defendants violated a number of congressional
restrictions, including the so-called Boland Amendments' ban on aid
to the Nicarauguan rebels, known as Contras. The series of Boland
Amendments were enacted as part of spending bills.
   The department took no position on whether the Boland Amendments
applied to North and other National Security Council aides. But it
said: ``Congress cannot through its appropriations or other powers
invade any sphere of constitutional authority granted exclusively to
the president.''
   The Justice Department argued that Walsh incorrectly assigned to
Congress broad powers over foreign affairs not provided by the
constitution.
   ``Contrary to the IC's suggestion, there is a sphere of
presidential activity that could not constitutionally be limited by
any congressional enactment,'' said the brief by Assistant Attorneys
General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the criminal division, and
Douglas W. Kmiec, head of the office of legal counsel.
   Invoking the doctrine of executive privilege, the Justice
Department also challenged Walsh's assertion that Congress must be
kept informed of covert operations.
   ``Because of the doctrine of executive privilege and the
president's inherent foreign affairs authority, Congress' authority
to compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity is
necessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations.''
   The department did not dispute Walsh's proposition that the
charge covers a conspiracy to violate federal laws and to defraud
President Reagan by corrupting his efforts to free American hostages
by selling arms to Iran.
   Dennis told reporters a court's adoption of the department's
position would ``not necessarily'' result in dismissal of
allegations in the indictment's first count that the defendants
illegally helped arm the Contras.
   Kmiec said ``there's no basis'' to any suggestion that the brief
was filed to create a legal justification for presidential pardons
of North and his co-defendants.
   ``The brief is crafted and filed only in response to the
memorandum filed by the IC at the end of October,'' he said. It was
filed ``only after much anguish and with great reluctance.''
   Spokesman Loye Miller said: ``the Justice Department has not come
to the defense of Oliver North. The fact that Oliver North is the
defendant involved in the case is coincidental.''
   ``If a special prosecutor had taken the same position'' about
Congress' foreign policy role in another case, ``the issue would be
the same,'' Miller said. ``The executive branch would be very
upset.''
   In a statement, Walsh's office said, ``The Justice Department's
memorandum misstates our brief. It is addressed largely to
collateral issues that should obscure the criminal charges in the
indictment returned by the grand jury.''
   North, who is set to be the first of the four Iran-Contra
defendants to stand trial, is also charged with 15 other felonies,
including lying to Congress, obstructing a presidential
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair and pocketing $90,000 in
travelers' checks from the Contras.
   No date has been set for his trial.

<HEAD>Agriculture Economists Say Economic Expansion Likely To Persist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department economists say rising
consumer income should fuel a continued growth in demand for farm
products, and that the nation's overall economic expansion is likely
to continue beyond next year.
   ``The expansion is supported by continued improvement in the net
export deficit, which likely will induce businesses to invest
further in new plants and equipment,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said in a report Friday.
   The agency added that ``continued rising consumer income should
support domestic demand for agricultural products.''
   Little change is seen in the interest rates paid by farmers.
   Cash receipts for livestock sold this year are up 2 percent to 3
percent from 1987, and crop receipts are up 8 percent because of
``strong prices and large marketings from past years' inventories,''
the report said.
   Recent large payments on farm debt amassed in the early and
mid-1980s appear to be over, with loan volumes rising again at
commercial banks and the cooperative Farm Credit System, it said.
That is taken as an indication that many farmers are gearing up
again.
   ``Except for the Farmers Home Administration, major farm lenders
report stronger loan portfolios in 1988, and reductions in farm loan
delinquencies, loan charge-offs and foreclosures,'' the report said.
``However, some farmers are still under severe financial stress.''
   The agency continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers
_ the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses _ at
$55 billion to $60 billion, compared with last year's record $57.1
billion.
   Net cash income is the money farmers have to spend during the
year, including cash from sales of crops stored from previous
harvests. Many farmers sold off inventories to make up for 1988
drought losses.

<HEAD>Transport Chief Orders Review Of Air Safety In Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has been
ordered to conduct an immediate review of the busy Northeast
corridor air traffic control system because of a series of errors
that involved Air Force One, according to an unpublished letter.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley ordered the review in a
letter to FAA Administrator Allan McArtor earlier this week, two
days after a federal investigation revealed that a string of
controller errors caused Air Force One and a commuter plane to fly
too close to one another over New Jersey last month.
   A copy of the letter was obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
   The two aircraft came within 500 feet vertically and 1.5 miles
horizontally as they both began a descent into Newark International
Airport on Oct. 12, about half as close as is normally allowed by
federal regulation.
   The National Transportation Safety Board earlier this week urged
a review of the air traffic control operations in the Northeast
after concluding its investigation into the incident.
   The safety board said while the president's plane never may have
been in danger of a collision, the incident revealed problems that
could lead to ``an erosion of safety in (the) high density Northeast
(air traffic) system.''
   At times during the Oct. 12 incident, some air controllers
handling traffic near Air Force One did not know the location of the
president's jet as it flew from Philadelphia to Newark, and in one
case two controllers noticed the president's jet and the Bar Harbor
Airlines commuter plane converging but did not raise an alarm.
   Burnley in his Nov. 17 letter to McArtor said the NTSB
investigation ``describes a series of managerial, operational and
training deficiencies that, I am sure you agree, are unacceptable.''
   Burnley directed McArtor to proceed immediately with a broad
``system safety and efficiency'' review of air traffic control
procedures at the four FAA facilties near Washington, New York and
Philadelphia similar to one conducted after a string of controller
errors at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   Burnley also said he wanted the responsiblity for controller
quality assurance separated from the air traffic control bureacracy
and brought directly under the FAA administrator by Dec. 7.
   ``This (current) organizational structure simply has not
worked,'' Burnley said in the letter. He noted that the NTSB report
had cited controller problems that had been acknowledged as early as
l986 and ``remained uncorrected a year or two later'' at both the
Washington and New York air traffic control centers.
   He said eight of 14 operational problems found in a l987 review
of air traffic procedures at the Washington center ``remained
uncorrected over a year later.''

   President Reagan has received his Thanksgiving
turkey, a nearly 50-pound bird named ``Woody,'' who gobbled away
while the president petted him.
   ``What did you say?'' Reagan asked the talkative Iowa tom Friday
as several dozen guests looked on at the Rose Garden ceremony, which
has become an annual event.
   The president noted that, as usual, Woody would not ``go on a
platter'' next week, but will be taken instead to a petting zoo, in
nearby McLean, Va.
   The bird was raised by Pete Hermanson, president of the National
Turkey Federation, who operates Woodland Farms south of Story City,
Iowa.
   Hermanson's daughter, Melanie, said the birds were selected from
a VIP pen that she dubbed ``the presidential suite'' that is home to
a dozen or so turkeys.

<HEAD>Former Czechoslovak Leader Meets Italian Socialists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the former Czechoslovak Communist
Party leader ousted in 1968 after a Soviet-led invasion, met with
Italian political leaders during his first trip outside his country
in 18 years.
   Dubcek talked Friday with leading Socialists, including party
leader and former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, and met with Nilde
Iotti, a Communist who is president of the Chamber of Deputies, the
lower house of Parliament.
   He also met leaders of several parties' parliamentary delegations.
   Dubcek was removed from the Czechoslovak Communist Party and
assigned to a lowly bureaucratic job after the Warsaw Pact invasion
crushed his ``Prague Spring.'' He had tried to institute reforms to
liberalize Czechoslovak politics and the economy.
   Iotti greeted Dubcek with the words, ``We have followed you
during all these years even when little was said about you,''
according to the Italian news agency ANSA. ``You represented the
courage of the truth and liberty and for this we honor you.''
   Dubcek traveled to Italy to receive an honorary degree from the
University of Bologna.

<TEXT>
   A Panamanian cargo ship sank early Saturday during a
storm in the East China Sea near Taiwan, and 17 Filipino crew
members were missing and feared dead, coast guard officials said.
   A Japanese tanker rescued three of the 20 crew members from the
La Vie en Rose, a 4,415-ton vessel loaded with Malaysian timber,
said a coast guard official in Okinawa.
   The offical said a coast guard plane was dispatched to the scene
of the accident at dawn Saturday but found no traces of the missing
crew. A patrol boat also was due at the scene later Saturday.
   Authorities said they received a distress call from the Taiwanese
coast guard late Friday that the vessel was sinking 168 miles east
of Taiwan near the Okinawan island chain. The boat sank at 12:42
a.m. Saturday, officials said.
   The cargo vessel was bound for northern Japan when it began
taking on water, the coast guard said.
   According to the official, all 20 Filipino crew members escaped
the sinking ship in lifeboats but only three were found by a passing
tanker in waters described as rough.

   Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
urged lawyers and judges to fight discrimination in an address
kicking off a yearlong celebration of the bicentennial of the
federal court system.
   ``Much as we have made in the way of progress against racial
discrimination, gender discrimination, enforcement of the Bill of
Rights _ great as that progress has been _ there's still so much
still to be done,'' Brennan said Friday.
   The 82-year-old justice, who was appointed to the Supreme Court
in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and is now its oldest
member, made a luncheon address to about 800 lawyers, judges and
spectators.
   Pennsylania Supreme Court Justice Robert N.C. Nix Jr. and 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Justice A. Leon Higgenbotham Jr. both
praised Brennan's 32 years on the high court and urged him against
considering retirement.
   Brennan did not discuss his plans. He and Justice Thurgood
Marshall, who is also in his 80s and has said he does not intend to
retire, are considered the court's leading liberals.
   Brennan's appearance was sponsored by the Philadelphia Bar
Association and Federal Courts 200 Inc., which has organized a
series of events to mark the 200th anniversary of the creation of
the federal court system next year.
   The U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1787, provided for a Supreme
Court but gave Congress the authority to establish the federal
courts. On September 24, 1789, Congress passed and President
Washington signed legislation forming the Supreme Court, circuit
courts and district courts.
   Federal Courts 200 plans mock trials, debate competitions and
various festivities to mark the anniversary.

   When Emperor Hirohito was stricken two months ago,
Japan donned the cloak of ``jisshuku,'' self-restraint in deference
to his condition. Now they are weary of waiting and gloom, and many
complain of losing money.
   Sumiko Iwao, a sociologist at Keio University, said people
expected Hirohito, 87, to die fairly soon after he coughed up blood
from an intestinal hemorrhage Sept. 19.
   ``They canceled all these events and toned things down, thinking
it would only be two weeks,'' she said. ``Now there are lots of
economic repercussions. People are saying, `Haven't we done too
much?'''
   Eriko Kurabayashi said: ``So many things have been canceled _
concerts, year-end parties, sports events. If all this was something
that could help the emperor, all right, but it's caused so many
problems for people.''
   She said her company, which sells stuffed animals and party
decorations, is in a slump because ``stores are buying a lot fewer
of our products, especially stores near the Imperial Palace.''
   Hotel banquet business has declined dramatically because people
want to avoid the appearance of celebration. Manufacturers of
Christmas ornaments complain of slow sales and some say there will
be no traditional year-end bonuses for employees.
   Commercial television will lose money when Hirohito dies because
commercials will be taken off the air for two days.
   A network reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said,
``Financially, all the television stations are hoping the emperor's
death is announced before 6 p.m. It may be terrible to say, but if
it comes later in the night, we'll lose advertising income for that
night plus two full days.''
   While the emperor lives, news media spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars daily keeping reporters, sound trucks, cars and drivers
at the palace and on 24-hour standby.
   Some reporters have been hospitalized with fatigue and others
spend so much time at the palace they have clean underwear sent by
express mail.
   The post office has a particular dilemma about New Year greeting
cards, which sell for 40 yen (33 cents) and and are marked with the
year of the emperor's reign.
   It printed 3.7 billion cards marked Showa 64 for the 64th year of
Hirohito's Showa Era. But if the emperor dies before 1989 begins,
the cards should carry the mark of the new imperial era, as yet
unnamed.
   Palace and government officials remain resolutely silent about
what will happen when Hirohito dies. Any comment would acknowledge
that the government is preparing for the death of the man who has
ruled longer than any living monarch and once was considered divine.
   Some sectors of the public are less deferential. Opposition
political parties condemn excessive reverence for the emperor, which
they say is fostered by bureaucrats and the press.
   A group calling itself Christians Proposing the Emperor's Apology
wants Hirohito to apologize for Japan's conduct in World War II.
   In a letter to Crown Prince Akihito, the organization said Japan
had ruled other Asian countries brutally in the emperor's name and
declared:
   ``Because your father has not taken responsibility for this, the
deep anger of many of the people of Asia and of the people of Japan
has recently increased. If your father were to end his life without
(apologizing), we are deeply concerned that your father might be in
the end unable to bear up under the judgment of God, the Lord of
history.''

<HEAD>U.S.-Canadian Trade Agreement At A Glance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Canada-Election, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE TRADING PARTNERS _ The two nations already are each other's
largest trading partner. The annual exchange of $150 billion makes
it the largest two-nation trading partnership in the world.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE AGREEMENT _ President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney signed the agreement Jan. 2. The U.S. Congress approved the
agreement but it still needs Canadian parliamentary approval, which
depends on Monday's election. The agreement would take effect Jan.
1, 1989, and eliminate any remaining tariffs between the countries
over a 10-year period, dismantle many investment barriers, free up
trade in energy and services, and create Canadian-U.S. panels to
settle disputes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOCIAL PROGRAMS _ Opponents charge that Canadian social programs
such as medicare, unemployment insurance and pensions will be
affected by the need to compete on an equal footing. Supporters
maintain social programs are unaffected by the agreement and
protected by international trade law.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CULTURE _ Critics say Canadian industries such as publishing,
broadcasting and cinema could be overwhelmed by American programs.
Supporters argue that cultural policies are exempt from the
agreement and remain protected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EMPLOYMENT _ Opponents charge that Canada would pay too high a
price under the agreement for a relatively small number of
lower-paying jobs in the service sector that would be created by
increased trade. They say farmers and food processors and the
textile and appliance industries would be among the hardest hit by
U.S. competition. Supporters forecast as many as 250,000 new jobs in
Canada during the first 10 years of the agreement.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES _ The United States would gain
non-discriminatory access to Canadian energy supplies. Opponents
argue this could lead to Canada losing control of its vast energy,
water and other natural resources and being reduced to a source of
raw materials for the U.S. market. Supporters maintain the agreement
means Canadian energy exports will no longer face the future threat
of U.S. trade sanctions that could limit sales and that Canada still
would control its resources in the event of shortages.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE FUTURE _ Opponents paint a grim picture of Canada losing
control of its economic future and say political sovereignty could
suffer as a result of the agreement. They say Canada already is too
dependent on the United States as a customer and should develop
markets in other countries instead. Supporters say access to the
larger U.S. market must be guaranteed to ensure future Canadian
prosperity. They argue that without the agreement Canada risks
becoming an isolated international backwater, the smallest
industrial nation without participation in a larger trading bloc.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers and environmental activists are
setting strategy in Seattle this weekend to combat what they see as
literally a life-and-death problem: the rapid disappearance of the
Earth's rain forests.
   ``The forests are like the lungs of the planet ... and we know
now that the burning of particularly rain forests contributes as
much as 25 percent of the carbon dumping into the atmosphere,'' said
Randall Hayes. ``And whether you live in Iceland or Seattle or the
middle of the Amazon, the `greenhouse effect' is going to affect
you.''
   ``By 2050, virtually all large tracts of rain forest will be
gone,'' said Hayes, director of the California-based Rainforest
Action Network and a conference participant. ``So essentially we're
the last generation on Earth that will have a chance to save the
tropical rain forests. If we don't, we'll have to live with the
effects _ if we can.''
   While the devastation of tropical rain forests has received much
notice in recent years, the conference also will consider what
deforestation means to the lush, temperate rain forests of the
Pacific Northwest.
   ``If we stopped the import of tropical timber, that would put
more pressure on the Pacific Northwest. So we need a more integrated
plan to tackle this issue as a whole,'' Hayes said.
   ``I think it's really important that we take a global look at
forestry and get out of the in-our-backyard syndrome,'' agreed Pam
Crocker Davis, a conference organizer and former director of the
state Audubon Society.
   ``To make the connection between what it happening in the tropics
and what is happening here is critical,'' she said.
   The conference at the University of Washington is titled ``Decade
of the Rain Forest: Strategies for Tropical & Temperate Survival.''
Its value is in bringing together a wide variety of participants,
including non-professionals, Hayes said.
   ``Citizen watchdog groups are going to be key (in saving the
forests),'' he said. ``We've learned that we clearly cannot leave
this in the hands of the federal government and we can't leave it in
the hands of the industry.''
   But the effort needs to go in myriad directions, he noted.
   ``We don't want to win the tropical rain forest battle and have
the end result of having the forests in the United States and Canada
be annihilated,'' he said.
   Conference organizers lay out some stark figures to drive home
their point: An estimated 2.4 billion acres of tropical rain forest
survive in the world, but it is disappearing at a rate of about 1
percent per year _ or about one acre per second, they say.
   In the western United States, less than 3.2 million acres remains
of the original 15 million acres of old growth.
   The weekend gathering will feature presentations and panel
discussions on topics ranging from climate and forest management to
the spiritual value of forests.
   On Monday and Tuesday, representatives from environmental and
other groups will gather on Whidbey Island to actually plot
strategy, said Marcia Rutan of the Chinook Learning Center, a prime
sponsor of the conference.
   Among the strategies Hayes sees would be a national
wood-conservation policy, including such things as wood recycling
and developing alternative materials to use in place of wood.
   Another possible step is support for legislation that would ban
tropical wood imports unless the nations producing those woods put
together plans to save pristine rain forests, he said.

<HEAD>Three Unions At Eastern Seek To Block Sale of Shuttle to Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three unions at Eastern Airlines have sought a
preliminary injunction to block the $365 million sale of its
Northeast shuttle to real estate magnate Donald Trump.
   The motion filed Friday in U.S. District Court by the
International Association of Machinists, the Air Line Pilots
Association and Local 553 of the Transport Workers Union had been
anticipated for a month.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in October had scheduled a
hearing on it for Dec. 2, giving Eastern until Nov. 25 to file a
response.
   The three unions contend that the sale of the Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle violates the Railway Labor Act as part of an
attempt by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., to break the unions in
the midst of collective bargaining on new contracts.
   ``The sale is yet another attempt by (Texas Air Chairman) Frank
Lorenzo to dismantle Eastern Airlines,'' said Jack Bavis, head of
the pilots' union at the carrier.
   Although the shuttle has been consistently profitable, Texas Air
contends the sale is necessary to raise cash for preserving the rest
of Eastern, which has lost more than $300 million since 1986.
   The shuttle deal is scheduled for completion Dec. 15.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Legislation Authorizing $11.2 Billion for NASA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed legislation
authorizing $11.2 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and re-creating a National Space Council, an advisory
group dissolved after the Nixon years.
   The legislation signed Friday includes $900 million to begin work
on a space station, of which $515 million must be cleared by George
Bush by May 15.
   The legislation gives the new president a say on whether to
proceed with the space station. NASA plans to ask for $2.1 billion
in fiscal 1990 and a Bush go-ahead would indicate the new
administration's commitment to build the $24 billion station.
   Reagan two years ago vetoed a NASA authorization bill and took
exception to a provision that would have re-established a National
Space Council in the president's office to advise him on
space-related matters. But on Friday, he signed the legislation
which does that very thing.
   There have been indications that Bush will name Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle to head the office.
   In opposing the space council earlier, Reagan said that ``besides
creating additional and unnecessary bureaucracy, the National Space
Council would duplicate the functions of the interagency bodies ...
that already coordinate the development and implementation of space
policy.''

<HEAD>Atwater Promises Quick GOP Start On 1990 Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Atwater, tapped by President-elect George
Bush to take over the Republican National Committee, says the party
will start work immediately on the 1990 campaign.
   ``There's all kinds of races going on,'' Atwater noted Friday,
saying he especially wants to start recruiting for the midterm
congressional elections.
   While the Republicans have captured the White House in five of
the last six elections, they have not been able to gain control of
Congress. All of the House and one-third of the Senate seats are up
in 1990.
   The Republican National Committee meets in January to pick a new
chairman to succeed Frank Fahrenkopf, and Bush's endorsement
virtually guarantees that Atwater will be elected.
   Atwater, who managed Bush's campaign, said he has started making
peace with the other Republicans who ran for the party's
presidential nomination.
   Atwater said he plans to launch a program to recruit more blacks,
Hispanics and Asians to join the party, but he did not specify how
this would be carried out. GOP leaders for years have said they want
more minorities to become Republicans, but so far that has not
happened.

   An appellate tribunal ruled there was
no cause to keep holding 16 opposition activists jailed since July
after an anti-government demonstration turned violent, state-run
radio said.
   The Voice of Nicaragua broadcast said the 16 were ``absolved of
blame'' Friday on charges that included violating state security
laws. It did not say when they would be freed.
   Thirty-eight people were arrested after police violently broke up
a July 10 demonstration sponsored by the opposition Nicaraguan
Democratic Coordinate in Nandaimes, about 40 miles south of Managua,
the capital.
   Voice of Nicaragua said proceedings against nine detainees were
``provisionally suspended,'' but did not elaborate.
   It said proceedings against the remaining 13 activists were
continuing in Granada, about 27 miles east of Managua.
   Among those still subject to trial were Carlos Huembes, the
coordinate's president; Roger Guevara, its secretary-general; Miriam
Arguello, a leader of the Nicaraguan Conservative Party, and
Augustin Jarquin, a Social Democratic Party leader.
   Jarquin, Arguello and Social Democrat Marcos Herrera were freed
on bail Tuesday after suffering medical problems while in detention.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed an executive order
aimed at speeding the nuclear-plant licensing process by giving a
federal agency sweeping new powers to carry out evacuation plans for
disputed nuclear power plants.
   White House officials issued no statements Friday beyond the
four-page order signed by the president, although the question of
expanding the authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
had been debated within the administration for months.
   The principal aim of the order is to help utilities get operating
licenses in instances where community opposition has held up
approval of evacuation plans. The plans must be OK'd by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission before a license is granted.
   The operation of two plants, Shoreham on Long Island, N.Y., and
Seabrook in New Hampshire, has been stalled because state and local
governments, responding to community pressures, have refused to
submit evaucation plans to the NRC.
   Reagan's order substantially changes the role of FEMA in
emergency planning for nuclear plants and gives the agency virtual
police powers during actual radiological emergencies.
   The agency ``shall make all necessary plans and arrangements to
ensure that the federal government is prepared to assume any and all
functions and undertakings necessary to provide adequate protection
to the public ...,'' the order said, in part.
   Before licensing battles over Shoreham and Seabrook, state
governments had been required to submit acceptable evacuation plans
as part of the NRC licensing process. State and local opposition to
both plants led the NRC to accept plans submitted by their
utility-owners. But both plans face challenges on grounds that
utilities lack the police powers to carry them out in a genuine
crisis.
   Reagan's order addresses that problem by empowering FEMA to carry
out plans.
   Seabrook, finished two years ago, has been stalled for lack of
required emergency plans, principally because Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis refuses to cooperate.
   Ron Sher, a spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, the company that
operates Seabrook, said in a telephone interview that he did not
believe the order was signed principally to benefit Seabrook.
   New Hampshire, under Gov. John Sununu, long ago submitted an
emergency plan for 17 of its communities near the plant. But owners
have had to submit plans for six nearby Massachusetts communities
that have refused to participate in emergency planning. They claim
the public safety could not be assured in case of a major accident.
   ``We just find it hard to believe that there's much in this plan
that would help us right now,'' Sher said in the interview. ``Maybe
it would have two years ago.''
   Earlier this year, Sununu had vehemently denied that he had been
pushing for the order to get the Seabrook plant into operation.
Sununu was named this week as White House chief of staff for
President-elect George Bush.
   Sununu's spokesman, Edward Lecius, denied in June that Sununu had
helped originate the order.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who
oppose the order, had said earlier this year that they were
pessimistic about defeating it. Gregg won the New Hampshire
governor's race last week to succeed Sununu.
   Paul McEachern, a Democratic critic of Seabrook who lost to Gregg
for the governorship, said the order was a foregone conclusion.
   ``I believe they decided not to do anything until after the
election,'' McEachern said. ``The circumstantial evidence is
overwhelming that was the case, that they would get it signed at the
first appropriate time after the election.''
   Critics called the order a major change, even in advance of its
signing by Reagan.
   ``It's a major change in FEMA's role. ... It makes them judge and
jury of the plan,'' said anti-Seabrook attorney Matthew Brock.
   Jerry Mikorenda, a spokesman for the owner of the Shoreham plant,
Long Island Lighting Co., said Reagan's order ``resolves questions
of legal authority'' and ``reaffirms our position,'' though he said
the utility will continue with its plan to sell and close the plant.
   Terry Lynam, spokesman for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said the
governor was not surprised by the order ``because the (Reagan)
administration is determined to get the plant open.'' Cuomo is
opposed to the licensing of Shoreham.
   In a separate action, Reagan on Friday signed an executive order
establishing a nine-member President's Commission on Catastrophic
Nuclear Accidents to study ways to fully compensate victims of such
an accident beyond the limit of public liability called for by
Congress. The commission _ which is to file its report to Congress
by Aug. 20, 1990 _ also is to recommend any changes in laws and
rules necessary for the prompt, proper payment of valid damage
claims, as well as recommend any procedures needed to handle such
claims.

   Federal safety officials have agreed to
forgive the record $5.1 million in fines they levied against five
companies involved in building L'Ambiance Plaza, which collapsed and
killed 28 people, according to a published report.
   The Hartford Courant reported in Saturday's editions that
representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
agreed to drop the fines Friday after meeting all day with a
mediation panel seeking to settle litigation stemming from the
building's collapse.
   Instead, the federal agency will accept $430,000, the cost of its
investigation into the construction accident, The Courant reported.
   The apartment building was under construction when it collapsed
on April 23, 1987, killing 28 men and injuring 16.
   After the collapse, OSHA levied the $5.1 million in fines, citing
the project's contractors with willful violations of safety
regulations.
   Fined were Texstar Construction Corp., $2.5 million;
TPMI-Macomber, $2.5 million; and three smaller firms for lesser
amounts.
   Terry Mikelson, a spokesman for OSHA in Washington, comfirmed
Friday that a settlement had been reached in the fines, but he
declined to release any specifics.

   An Organization of American
States committee approved a proposal to provide more diplomatic
rights to Latin ambassadors of the Washington-based organization.
The U.S. delegate abstained.
   Richard T. McCormack walked out of an OAS committee session after
clashing over the resolution Friday with Carlos Tunnerman,
Nicaragua's ambassador to the OAS. Diplomats viewed the resolution
as a product of the Tunnerman's expulsion from the United States in
July.
   Tunnerman was Nicaragua's ambassador to the United States when he
and seven other Nicaraguan diplomats were expelled from Washington
in retaliation for Nicaragua's expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven U.S. diplomats.
   Nicaragua at the time claimed Melton was working to destabilize
the leftist government, a charge denied by Melton.
   The resolution approved Friday calls for study of amendments to
agreements between the OAS and the United States to provide more
diplomatic rights for Latin American representatives to the
31-member OAS.
   The full OAS General Assembly meets later today to approve all
committee resolutions.
   McCormack said he had no objections to the resolution, but added,
``The United States has the sovereign right'' to control entry to
the United States by OAS representatives.
   Tunnerman responded by criticizing ``the abusive way'' in which
the Reagan administration expelled him from the United States.
   Earlier Friday, an OAS committee approved an Inter-American Human
Rights Commission report that singled out Chile, Paraguay, El
Salvador, Cuba, Nicaragua and Guatemala for human rights abuses.

   The voices of nearly 5,000 children
singing the Mickey Mouse theme song echoed through the Magic Kingdom
as Walt Disney's famous rodent celebrated his 60th birthday with a
gala party.
   The youngsters represented 116 American cities and several
foreign lands at the celebration at Walt Disney World. They all know
and love Mickey Mouse. And they showed it Friday.
   ``He was even better than I expected,'' gushed 12-year-old Amy
Glesson of Dublin, Ireland. ``More real than I thought.''
   Walt Disney World had invited the children, who were mostly from
low-income families, as the park's special guests, and a similar
celebration for an equal number of children was held at Disneyland
in California.
   Some of the children were orphans. Others attend special schools
of different kinds. Most had never flown in an airplane until this
week, and many never had an opportunity to visit Disney parks or
similar attractions.
   The theme song from the Mickey Mouse Club _ the one that spells
out M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E _ was heard with many different
inflections and accents, from the small towns of the Deep South to
the farmlands of Missouri and the streets of Paris.
   A small group from the Soviet Union accompanied one of their own,
a guitar-playing orphan, in singing ``Happy Birthday'' and ``It's a
Small World'' in their native language.
   ``Mickey's loving it. He hasn't heard that many `happy birthdays'
in all his 60 years,'' said Dick Nunis, president of Walt Disney
World.
   But nobody liked it better than the kids.
   ``Next to winning the hockey championship at school, this is the
best thing that's happened to me in my life,'' said Christopher
Leitao, 10, of Boston.
   The daylong party celebrated the Disney character's debut on Nov.
18, 1928, at the Colony Theater in New York City in ``Steamboat
Willie,'' the first cartoon with synchronized sound.
   ``He actually looked a little cruder and more rat-like back in
the 30s,'' said David R. Smith, archivist for Walt Disney Co. in
Burbank, Calif. ``But over the years, as different artists came in,
he's kind of smoothed out. He's been given more human
characteristics. He looks pretty good for 60.''
   Friday's festivities also included a global sing-along of the
Mickey Mouse theme song on radio stations around the world. Disney
said broadcasters on every continent and at the North and South
poles played the 12-line classic at 9:50 a.m. EST.
   At Walt Disney World, the children from age 8 to 12, decked out
in colored Disney T-shirts and mouse-ear hats, marched in a parade
Friday behind Mickey and Minnie Mouse.
   The youngsters then watched a special parade of Disney characters
and each took a slice of what Disney called the world's largest
birthday cake, 12 inches wide and 1,000 feet long.
   Friday night, with the park closed to regular visitors, the
children took in as many attractions as they could get to, had
photos taken with their big-eared hero, and watched goggle-eyed at a
special parade and fireworks.
   Vitaly Yakimov, 9, from Moscow, said the best part of coming was
that ``everybody smiles _ the children and adults _ everybody.''
   The Soviet children presented Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner
and Ron Allen, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines, with a
Russian tea service and a cartoon picture of Misha the Russian bear
greeting Mickey. Delta provided the free flights for the children.
   Among the foreign cities represented were Dublin and Limerick in
Ireland; Frankfurt and Munich, Germany; Toronto and Montreal,
Canada; Nassau, Bahamas; and London, Moscow and Paris.

   A twin-engine plane crashed and burned
Friday night as it tried to land here in a heavy thunderstorm,
killing all seven people on board, sheriff's deputies said.
   Earlier Friday, five people died in small plane crashes in New
York and Texas, leaving Friday's civil aviation death toll at 12.
   In addition, lightning struck a TWA jetliner 50 miles from Little
Rock's airport Friday, a Delta Air Lines flight from Chicago to
Dallas-Fort Worth made an emergency landing at Shreveport (La.)
Regional Airport, and a huge fuel spill at San Francisco's airport
forced delays and diversions for hundreds of flights.
   The names of the seven dead in the Batesville crash were not
available, said Roger Williams, a dispatcher for the Independence
County Sheriff's Department.
   Williams said the Beechcraft King Air turboprop ``had made one
approach and missed the Batesville airport and they were attempting
a second time'' when it crashed just after 6 p.m. about 12 miles
west of the airport. The remote crash site is some 90 miles
northeast of Little Rock.
   The flight originated at Orange, Texas, outside Houston, said
Wayne Beckmann, duty officer at the Federal Aviation
Administration's southwest regional office in Fort Worth.
   Beckmann confirmed that the plane crashed after its second
approach.
   Arkansas was under a flash flood watch when the crash occurred
during a heavy thunderstorm.
   ``The weather was about as bad as you can get,'' Williams said.
``The officers at the scene said it was raining, and so foggy you
couldn't see the ground.''
   Elsewhere, three people were killed when a single-engine
Beechcraft Bonanza apparently lost power shortly after takeoff from
a Shirley, N.Y., airport, authorities said.
   The plane, which can seat four to six people, had reached an
altitude of about 200 feet before it crashed near the Brookhaven
Airport on Long Island, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   In Fort Worth, Texas, two people were killed when their
single-engine Cessna 150 crashed on a highway near Meacham Field.
   The TWA jet, en route to Little Rock, Ark., from St. Louis with
76 passengers, was struck by lightning about 50 miles from the
Arkansas airport, authorities said.
   ``There was a large bolt of lightning, almost like a white,
yellow flash,'' said James Earl Wilson, a passenger on the DC-9.
``It seemed almost immediately like we lost some power. I was
concerned that maybe the engine went out.''
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said lightning struck the plane's left
wing about 10:30 a.m., damaging a metal section that controls
elevation. The jet landed safely at Little Rock about 26 minutes
later, Morrison said.
   Passengers on the plane were shaken but unhurt.
   In the Delta incident, a Shreveport Fire Department official said
there were reports that the jet, Flight 505, blew a tire while
taking off from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and that part
of the tire flew into one of the plane's two engines, causing it to
shut down.
   It also was reported that the plane's flaps were not working
properly, said a fire department official who asked not to be
identified.
   The plane landed without incident about 10 p.m. An airport police
spokesman, who also asked not to be identified, said there were no
injuries among the 95 passengers and crew members.
   Delta officials could not be reached immediately for comment.
   Passenger J.R. Robinson of Plano, Ill., said he and others aboard
the plane were told that the aircraft was low on fuel because of bad
weather and had to land in Shreveport.

   A simple gray headstone marks the graves
of 409 people in a cemetery overlooking San Francisco Bay,
representing nearly half of the 913 people who died in the Jonestown
mass suicide a decade ago.
   As they have every year, friends and relatives of the Jonestown
victims gathered at the site Friday for a memorial service on the
anniversary of the deaths at the Peoples Temple jungle compound in
Guyana in South America.
   ``It's taken me a long time to get enough courage to come,'' said
Kim Dutra, one of 40 people who attended the service. She carried a
bouquet of red roses to the site where her mother, Beverly, is
buried.
   ``You know, sometimes the best thing to do is just put it behind
you.''
   Dutra's mother and 13-year-old brother were among the 912
followers of the Rev. Jim Jones who died along with him at Jonestown
on Nov. 18, 1978. Most committed suicide by drinking a poison-laced
beverage.
   The mass suicide came hours after church loyalists killed a U.S.
congressman, three journalists and a temple defector who had flown
to the complex to investigate complaints of abuse and tyranny there.
   Many of the dead were cremated or buried in family cemeteries.
The 409 bodies buried at Evergreen Cemetery could not be
individually identified because no fingerprints or other records
were available in the United States.
   Eddie Norwood recalled how his mother, who was not a Temple
member, kept him hidden from his father and other family members who
did belong to the cult. She feared Jones was psychotic and
dangerous, and feared he would have the child kidnapped to join the
church.
   ``I was hurt and I did not know then, but I know now,'' said
Norwood, who was 8 years old when 27 members of his family died at
Jonestown.
   On Friday, he joined his mother, Jynona Norwood, and other
relatives at the cemetery.
   One of their relatives, Fred Lewis, stood by the grave as the
service began, clutching a banner that read: ``10 Yr Jonestown
Memorial. We Will Not Forget.'' Breaking into tears, Lewis told the
gathering that he never had the emotional strength to talk at other
memorial services.
   ``This is the first time it happened that I've been able to cope
with the situation,'' he said later. ``I feel good and I'm happy,
I'm very happy to see so many people out here today.''
   Jynona Norwood, an evangelist who organizes the memorial each
year, said Jones offered a utopian world that provided food,
clothing, shelter and a form of religious solace to a wide spectrum
of people: poor minorities from the ghetto, pimps, prostitutes as
well as the average person on the street.
   ``The people at Jonestown were people who loved other people,
they weren't crazy,'' she said.
   But, Norwood said, a power-hungry Jones abused their trust and
faith, demanding absolute loyalty through sadistic mind-control
techniques. Peoples Temple turned out to be another cult, she said.
   Under pressure from allegations of misconduct, Jones moved most
of his Peoples Temple from San Francisco to Guyana, the only
English-speaking country in South America, in 1977. The cult leader
believed he would be safe from what he perceived as media and police
persecution.
   Yolanda Williams, a Peoples Temple member who left Guyana about
four months before the deaths, said, ``When I left it was with a
measure of hope for them (those remaining) _ that maybe we would
have a prayer.''
   Today, she said, she still lives in fear that a Jones loyalist
will hunt her down for speaking out against the Temple.

   A band, a huge birthday cake and greetings
from presidents past, present and future helped Carrie White
celebrate her achievement: living to age 114, making her the world's
oldest person.
   Mrs. White also received a citation from the ``Guinness Book of
World Records'' during the celebration Friday under a large blue and
white tent at Putnam Memorial Nursing Home.
   Mrs. White, dressed in a pink dress and pink hat, sat in a
wheelchair, clutched a stuffed doll and shielded her eyes from the
glare of television lights and photographers' flashes.
   David Banks, head of the company that owns the nursing home,
where Mrs. White lives, presented her with a certificate from the
Guinness book.
   ``What's that?'' she asked faintly as it was placed on her tray.
   ``She's very aware what today is about and she dotes on attention
and hamming it up for the cameras,'' said Marjorie Allen, her
guardian.
   She said Mrs. White has a passion for Coca-Cola and chews Red Man
tobacco.
   ``Carrie White World's Oldest Person'' was written in frosting on
the cake, which featured 114 candles, a small globe and two
hourglasses.
   Several letters from well-wishers were read to a crowd of about
500 people, many of them her nursing home companions.
   Letters came from President Reagan, President-elect George Bush,
former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, and Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez.
   ``Happy Birthday! How exciting to celebrate your 114th birthday.
That is quite an achievement,'' said the letter from Bush.
   Palatka Mayor Tim Smith proclaimed Friday ``Carrie White Day''
and said she was one of the few people who had a chance to be ``a
teen-ager twice in a lifetime.''
   Mrs. White was born in rural Gadsen County in 1874, just nine
years after the end of the Civil War.
   In London, Guinness spokeswoman Anna Nicholas said Friday, ``We
have a lot of original proof, so as much as we can ever be sure,
she's the oldest person.''
   Ms. Nicholas said that since Mrs. White was hospitalized for many
years starting in 1909 for post-typhoid psychosis, she has ``medical
documentation that goes way back.'' Guinness also sends researchers
to check on such claims and has an expert in Britain who looks at
the evidence, she said.
   Karl Dalke, chief of research for the Florida Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services, said the Social Security
Administration also verified Mrs. White's age as 114.
   Mrs. White will have to wait at least a year before her name
appears in the record book because the 1989 edition has already gone
to press, said assistant editor Cyd Smith in New York.
   According to the Guinness records, the greatest authenticated age
to which any human has ever lived is 120 years, 237 days. Shigechiyo
Izumi of Asan, Tokunoshima Island, Japan, was born June 19, 1865,
and died Feb. 21, 1986.
   Mrs. White is three months older than Jeanne Calmet of Arles,
France, who was listed as the world's oldest person in this year's
edition of the book.

   The nation's health care costs jumped 9.8
percent last year to $500.3 billion, or $1,987 for every man, woman
and child, a federal report says.
   The annual report issued Friday by the Health Care Financing
Administration highlighted one of the major challenges facing the
incoming Bush administration: how to insure health care for an aging
population during a time when spending on Medicare and Medicaid is
already a major contributor to the national debt.
   The popular conception is that Medicare is self-financed by
Social Security payroll deductions paid by retired and current
workers.
   The reality is that 75 percent of the money to pay for the
fastest growing part of the program _ doctor services _ comes
straight from the treasury.
   All of the federal share of Medicaid _ states pay about half _
comes from the treasury.
   Medicare and the federal share of Medicaid accounted for $144.7
billion of the nation's total health bill in 1987, an increase of
8.9 percent from calendar 1986.
   Largely because of cost containment programs instituted by the
Reagan administration, the federal increase was substantially less
than the 11.7 percent increase for state and local spending and the
9.8 percent rise for private spending.
   Still, federal health spending in calendar 1987 was more than
double the $71 billion it was the year before Reagan took office in
1981.
   State and local health spending amounted to $62.7 billion in 1987
and the private share was $293 billion.
   Measured as a part of the overall economy, the $500.3 billion in
total health spending consumed a record 11.1 percent of the Gross
National Product in 1987, up from 10.7 percent in 1986. GNP
represents the total of all goods and services produced in the
economy. The health care costs work out to an average of $1,987 for
every man, woman and child.
   Health spending was 9.1 percent of GNP the year before Reagan
took office and 5.9 percent in 1965, before the advent of Medicare
and Medicaid.
   ``Providing effective health care at affordable cost is a major
challenge confronting our society,'' said Dr. William L. Roper, the
HCFA administrator whose agency oversees Medicare and Medicaid.
   Noting that Medicare and Medicaid are the largest single payers
of medical bills _ accounting for 28.9 percent of all spending _
Roper said, ``It is imperative that we identify the most effective
means of providing health care to avoid unnecessary and duplicate
procedures.''
   The various state and local programs paid a total of 12.5 percent
of medical costs in 1987 while millions of individuals and thousands
of private insurance companies paid the other 58.6 percent.
   The annual report, which normally comes out in the summer, was
delayed this year because HCFA actuaries were occupied with changes
in Medicare and Medicaid, prompted by enactment of the catastrophic
health insurance measure, the largest single expansion of Medicare
in its two-decade history.
   The report is figured on a calendar year basis because it
incorporates private as well as public expenditures.
   Medicare expenditures alone were $79.9 billion in fiscal 1987 _
the government accounting period from Oct. 1, 1986 through Sept. 30,
1987 _ and increased 7.7 percent from fiscal 1986, a little less
than the overall 9.8 percent increase.
   Roper noted that programs to constrain the growth of hospital
charges resulted in an increase of less than 2 percent in Medicare
hospital spending in fiscal 1987 while payments for physicians'
services continued to grow at double-digit rates.
   ``Between fiscal year 1975 and fiscal year 1987, Medicare
physician spending per beneficiary increased at a compound annual
rate of 15 percent,'' Roper said in a statement accompanying the
report.
   ``Over the next 10 years, even without any program expansions, we
project that Medicare spending for physicians' services will
triple,'' said Roper.
   He predicted that Medicare outlays will exceed the yearly
spending for Social Security within two decades.
   Counting both public and private spending, hospital care
accounted for 39 percent of total expenditures, physicians' services
20 percent and nursing homes 8 percent.
   The rest went for a variety of other expenses, such as medicines
purchased directly by individuals.

<HEAD>Speaker: Waite Release Separate From Iranian Influence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian parliament speaker said the
release of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite is an issue separate
from Iran's influence in Lebanon, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported today.
   The news agency, monitored in Cyprus, said speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani was reacting to a report that Kenyan President Daniel
Arap Moi carried a message to Iranian leaders asking them to mediate
to gain Waite's release from Lebanon.
   Moi delivered the message from ``unidentified Christian
authorities,'' the agency said. Moi ended an official three-day
visit Thursday to Iran.
   The agency quoted Iranian press reports saying Rafsanjani
acknowledged that the Islamic Republic has ``sway in Lebanon'' but
that ``Terry Waite's release from captivity is simply another
issue.''
   Waite, 49, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west
Beirut hotel to negotiate with Islamic Jihad, which has claimed to
hold kidnapped foreigners. No group claimed to hold Waite, but he is
widely believed to be held by Shiite Moslem militants.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held of the 15 foreign hostages in
Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Rafsanjani, who is also acting commander of the armed forces,
told university students in the southwestern provincial capital of
Ahwaz that Iran should pursue an independent foreign policy without
making enemies, the news agency said.
   The agency quoted him as saying Iran could have pursued such a
policy in the past without antagonizing countries such as Kuwait and
France. If Iran had demonstrated ``more tactfulness'' in dealing
with those two countries they might not have supported Iraq in the
Persian Gulf conflict, the agency said.
   ``Despite the inherent hostility with Islam in the Western world,
Iran is now in a position to make good on her previously crude
diplomacy,'' the agency quoted the speaker as saying.
   Rafsanjani also repeated that private business would play an
important role in postwar reconstruction. The Iran-Iraq war ended
Aug. 20 in a United Nations-brokered cease-fire, and since then
little progress has been reported in peace talks.

   Benazir Bhutto's election victory set
Pakistan on the road to democracy and was the repudiation she had
sought of the general who overthrew her father 11 years ago.
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was not present to suffer public
embarrassment. He died in a plane crash three months ago.
   Gen. Zia overthrew Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977,
after Pakistan's last open National Assembly election, and Bhutto
later was convicted of complicity in a murder conspiracy. He was
hanged in 1979.
   Zia still has many supporters among the military and the
affluent, but the the judiciary began restoring democracy after his
death and, in Wednesday's election, the people took a huge second
step.
   Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party, founded by her
father, proved that it still was the nation's most powerful
political organization.
   It won 92 of the 205 National Assembly seats at stake, far more
than the 54 gained by a conservative alliance of Zia loyalists. Ms.
Bhutto should be the next prime minister if she can form a majority
coalition.
   After ruling by martial law for eight years after the coup, Zia
held elections for a civilian government in 1985. Political parties
were not allowed to enter candidates, and Ms. Bhutto's followers and
others in the opposition boycotted the vote.
   He let the government, under Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo,
preside with limited powers until May, then dismissed it and the
National Assembly on grounds of corruption, incompetence and
slowness in applying Islamic law.
   The constitution required elections be held within 90 days, but
Zia ignored it. In late July he called them for Nov. 16, again on a
non-party basis. He died in the crash Aug. 17.
   Sources close to the general have confirmed that Zia intended the
elections to coincide with the birth of Ms. Bhutto's first child so
her personal campaigning would be limited. She is married to Asif
Ali Zardari, a Karachi businessman.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, gave birth to a full-term boy Sept. 21. After Zia
was killed, family sources admitted they had said the baby was due
in late November or early December to foil Zia's plans.
   Zia's iron control began to slip in June when the Supreme Court,
responding to a petition filed by Ms. Bhutto, struck down his decree
empowering the government to accept or reject political parties
applying to enter an election.
   When Zia died, the presidency passed to the president of the
Senate, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, a 73-year-old constitutional scholar.
   Ishaq Khan hinted at change by telling his first news conference,
on the day Zia was buried, he would let the courts rule on the
constitutionality of non-party elections.
   In decisions this fall, the Supreme Court struck down the
non-party rule and condemned Zia's dismissal of the Junejo
government as capricious. It also blocked an attempt by Junejo to
resume office, however, on grounds that might interfere with free
and fair elections.
   Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, Zia's successor as army commander, assured
the public he had no political aspirations and pledged to keep the
military out of the election.
   In doubt is Zia's plan for extending Islam into every aspect of
Pakistani life.
   Ms. Bhutto has said Islam should be Pakistan's religion but not
its politics, and has pledged not to let it interfere with the
rights of women or minorities. The Zia loyalists pledged support in
their election platform but rarely mentioned it in campaign speeches.

<HEAD>Republican Chiefs Say Bush Should Check Federal Spending To Ease
Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENDAL WEAVER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>POINT CLEAR, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican governors gathering here
generally recommend spending cuts, not new taxes, as the medicine
President-elect George Bush should use to cure the federal budget
deficit.
   ``Clearly, expenditures have to be cut,'' New Mexico Gov. Garrey
Carruthers said.
   ``Taxes are still too high in this country,'' said Delaware Gov.
Michael N. Castle, the conference chairman.
   Both men are among nearly two dozen GOP chief executives planning
to attend the National Republican Governors Conference. The agenda
for the meeting, which runs today through Tuesday, features a speech
by the president-elect on the closing day.
   ``We need to continue to look for ways to reduce costs, to invest
in prevention-oriented solutions at the state level, to collect the
billions of (tax) dollars that are not being collected right now,''
Castle said.
   Carruthers and Castle made their comments in interviews before
the conference's start.
   Most of those interviewed called for spending cuts or fiscal
restraint, and some promoted Bush's ``flexible freeze'' option in
suggesting ways to deal with the budget deficit left by the outgoing
Reagan administration.
   ``Cut spending, especially on the entitlement side,'' recommended
New Hampshire Gov.-elect Judd Gregg, who is succeeding the man Bush
has selected as his chief of staff, John Sununu. ``Go after the
COLAS (cost of living increases), don't believe anything (House
Speaker) Jim Wright has to say relative to the budget and don't make
deals.''
   ``I'm sure the president plans to handle it by continuing to
expand the economy and second, by working with Congress to reduce
the level of expenditure and set spending by priorities,'' said
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, whose state will play host to the
governors Sunday on a tour of the USS Lexington at Pensacola.
   ``Controlling spending is critical to deficit reduction,'' said
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, ``and the line-item veto authority
should be enacted to help our next president and the United States
succeed in reducing the federal deficit.''
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, Maine Gov. John R. McKernan
and Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad were among those who mentioned a
``flexible freeze'' as an alternative.
   Campbell said such a freeze on spending could limit budget growth
to a percentage of the inflation rate, perhaps 1 percentage point
below the Consumer Price Index.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, the host for the conference and the first
Republican governor of Alabama this century, was the only GOP chief
executive to mention specifically a balanced budget constitutional
amendment.
   But whatever the solution, Hunt said, controlling the deficit
must be the highest priority of the new administration.
   Without it, he said, ``I don't think you can address the other
matters.''
   The number of Republican governors dropped from 23 to 22 with the
Nov. 8 election. Most plan to attend the Point Clear conference.
   The four-day agenda includes remarks by Sununu, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, Bush senior adviser Bob Teeter, campaign manager
Lee Atwater, New York Rep. Jack Kemp, Republican National Committee
Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, and
University of Tennessee President Lamar Alexander, who served two
terms as governor of Tennessee.

   Three unmanned locomotives raced at more
than 80 mph through five towns and across more than 200 miles of
west Texas plains until workers diverted them onto a siding, where
they crashed into a line of empty boxcars, officials said.
   Vandals are suspected of setting the linked Union Pacific diesel
locomotives loose in Big Spring, about 100 miles south of Lubbock,
about 1:30 a.m. Friday. No one was injured.
   ``It couldn't have happened at a better time,'' railroad
spokesman Alex Tice said from company headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
``The line was clear, and there wasn't that much traffic (at
crossings) out at that time of the night.''
   The engines sped through railroad crossings without headlights or
any other warning. The straight track west of Big Spring helped keep
the engines from derailing along the way.
   ``It was moving so fast that it was passing through the crossings
before the signals could be activated,'' said Midland County Deputy
Sheriff Richard Gillette.
   Gillette was driving behind a police car that was almost hit by
the runaway train as it approached a crossing. That apparently was
the closest the locomotives came to hurting anyone as they traveled
214 miles through Big Spring, Midland, Pecos, Toyah and other towns
in western Texas.
   Tice said the 2{-hour odyssey began when someone revved up the
three engines in a rail yard in Big Spring, setting the lead
locomotive at full throttle. He didn't know if the engines had been
left idling, which is often the case.
   The train, which wasn't pulling any cars, ran through two
switches in Big Spring and onto the main line, Tice said.
   The engines were 40 miles down the line before Midland County
authorities alerted Union Pacific officials about the problem.
Gillette said one deputy clocked the train at 67 mph.
   Union Pacific authorities alerted police in counties farther
west, including Gary Ingram of the Reeves County sheriff's office.
   ``When I first heard about it, I thought someone was telling me a
joke,'' Ingram said. ``I told them I might saddle my horse and try
to run it down, but I didn't think it could run that fast. They
didn't find a whole lot of humor in that.''
   From Pecos, the train sped through Toyah at more than 80 mph,
Tice said. Ingram watched the train pass about 1{ miles south of his
ranch in Toyah.
   A Union Pacific employee finally diverted the train onto a siding
near Van Horn, about 125 miles east of El Paso.
   The yellow locomotives, which cost about $1 million each, hit a
line of more than 20 boxcars that had been set on the track. One
boxcar was knocked off the rails by the impact.
   The lead engine skidded onto its side about 250 feet ahead of the
other two locomotives, which remained upright. Tice said the fact
the two engines remained upright indicated the train had slowed for
some reason before the derailment.
   About 500 to 600 feet of track was damaged in the derailment, and
work crews were replacing that section Friday afternoon.
   Union Pacific blamed the incident on vandals, and is offering a
$25,000 reward for information leading to the culprits' arrest and
conviction.
   ``It might have just been a prank by someone who didn't know what
he had gotten into,'' Tice said.
   A second, unrelated railroad accident occurred Friday morning in
San Antonio. In that accident, believed to be caused by human error,
35 boxcars derailed after rolling from a siding onto the main line.
Two employees were treated for injuries, a railroad spokesman said.

<HEAD>East Coast Phone Service Disrupted As Crew Severs Cable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAYREVILLE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&T telephone service along the East
Coast was disrupted for about six hours when an underground
transmission cable was severed by a work crew, causing computer
problems as well as telephone outages.
   The trouble Friday was caused when a backhoe apparently severed
the 3-inch, fiber-optic cable at a railroad yard in Sayreville,
south of Newark.
   The accident forced massive rerouting of telephone calls that
ordinarily use the line, which carries about 200,000 calls an hour,
said AT&T District Manager Jim Nelson.
   ``It's almost like a highway in that you have to go along it to
get from, say, New York to Florida,'' said Nelson. ``This is a major
blockage affecting the whole East Coast.''
   The outage, which began at 12:15 p.m., was corrected by about
6:30 p.m. for most of the nation. However, service in areas near the
severed cable was still reported spotty late Friday.
   In addition to affecting phone service, private customers whose
computer networks use AT&T phone lines, including The Associated
Press wire service, experienced service problems Friday afternoon,
Nelson said.
   Harry Baumgartner, a spokesman for AT&T in Basking Ridge, said
calls between area codes on the East Coast were rerouted by AT&T's
computerized network, which relays calls along one of 14 lines in
other parts of the country according to the load on those other
regional systems.
   But not all calls were rerouted successfully. Many people
received a fast busy tone or a recording that indicated their call
could not go through, AT&T said.
   Baumgartner said it was impossible to estimate how many millions
of customers were affected by the problem.
   Fiber optic cables are composed of hair-thin strands of glass
that carry phone calls and data as pulses of light. They can
transmit many more calls than the traditional copper cables they are
replacing.
   The outage affected New Jersey Lottery ticket sales. Lottery
ticket machines were shut down from 12:15 p.m. until 9:30 p.m.
because of the telephone troubles, said lottery spokeswoman Sharon
A. Southard.

   Marilyn Quayle said she does not want to
succeed her husband as U.S. senator from Indiana because such an
appointment could become a political liability for the Bush
administration.
   The wife of Vice President-elect Dan Quayle withdrew her name
from consideration Friday after meeting the day before with Indiana
Gov. Robert D. Orr, who will name Quayles' successor.
   Mrs. Quayle made known her withdrawal in a statement released by
her husband's office. She also cited family considerations. She put
her career as an attorney on hold 10 years ago to raise the couple's
three children, who are now school age.
   ``I appreciate the confidence and support I have received from so
many people in Indiana and around the country,'' she said.
   Quayle spokesman Jeff Nesbit explained that if Mrs. Quayle was
appointed to the seat, every Senate vote she cast that differed with
Bush administration policy would be closely scrutinized by the media.
   ``They decided they didn't want to do anything that could cause a
problem for George Bush,'' Nesbit said.
   Quayle, elected vice president Nov. 8, announced Monday he would
step down as senator prior to Jan. 3 to give Orr, a Republican, the
opportunity to appoint a successor, rather than Gov.-elect Evan
Bayh, a Democrat. Bayh will be inaugurated Jan. 9.
   Mrs. Quayle became the second person in three days to withdraw as
a candidate for her husband's post. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., an
Indianapolis lawyer who served in the Reagan administration, said
Wednesday he informed Orr he was not interested in the job.
   An aide to Orr said about 25 other people remain interested in
the seat.
   Orr is looking for someone who can run for election to the
remainder of the term in 1990 and then seek re-election in 1992 if
the first effort is successful. State law allows an appointee to
serve only until the next general election. Quayle's term expires in
1992.
   Gubernatorial aide James E. Knoop said Orr has interviewed at
least eight candidates but has made no formal list.
   ``Right now, he's been responding to people who have wanted to
come see him,'' said Knoop. ``He has said he would agree to see some
of the people who have applied.''
   Among those who have met with Orr are Mrs. Quayle, Marion County
Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith and U.S. Rep. Dan Coats, who succeeded
Quayle in the U.S. House. Others mentioned have been U.S. Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut, former
Environmental Protection Agency head William Ruckelshaus and Lt.
Gov. John M. Mutz, the unsuccessful GOP gubernatorial candidate.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today accused the United States and Pakistan of creating obstacles
in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of Red
Army troops from Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' Gorbachev said at a ceremony
where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' Gorbachev said on the second day of his three-day
state visit to India.
   The Soviet Union agreed in April to withdraw its estimated
100,000 troops from Afghanistan, and about half the troops have
left. Soviet troops entered in December 1979 and have been helping
the Marxist government battle U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of continuing to
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev said a challenge by the Soviet republic
of Estonia to Kremlin authority was part of the ongoing process of
``perestroika,'' or social change promoted by the Soviet leader.
Estonia's parliament this week declared Estonia was sovereign and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   In his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Gorbachev said:
``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure
things will settle down.''
   The Soviet leader also said good relations between the Soviet
Union, China and India were necessary for peace in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations,'' he said. ``Our own relations with China are also
evolving in an encouraging way.''
   ``Thinking of countries like the Soviet Union, India and China,
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them
are extremely important for the destinies of Asia and for global
progress.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is scheduled to visit Beijing
next month, the first Indian head of government to visit the country
in 34 years. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is scheduled to visit
Moscow early next year.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have had long-standing border
problems with China. India and China fought a brief war in 1962 over
the issue.
   Gorbachev's comments on the unrest in the Baltic states were made
informally to reporters at a memorial to Mrs. Gandhi, which he
visited before the award ceremony.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, placed a wreath of red
roses at Mrs. Gandhi's memorial. He placed similar floral tributes
at memorials to her father and India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, and to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the hero of India's
freedom movement.
   An estimated 7,000 Afghan refugees, many of them opposed to
Soviet military involvement in their homeland, were confined to
their homes in New Delhi under police order for a second day. One
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any
embarrassment to the Soviet leader.
   The order asked Afghans not to ``move out of your residence till
21.11.88. ... Non-compliance of the order will render you liable for
prosecution.''
   The Afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations
every morning for a head count, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorbachev has sought to dispel any doubts about the future of
Soviet-Indian relations. In an apparent reference to China,
Gorbachev said ``the development of relations with third countries''
would not affect the Kremlin's friendly ties with India.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have showed signs of easing
long-standing strains in relations with China, prompting concerns
expressed by some Indian newspapers and some Indian officials about
shifts in the political balances in Asia.

   Coast guard ships searched for a missing sailor in
rough seas off Okinawa where a Panamanian cargo ship sank early
today. Officials said at least two crewmen were dead.
   Passing tankers from Japan and Britain and a Japanese Maritime
Safety Agency vessel rescued 19 of the La Vie en Rose's 20 crew
members, said an official at the agency's office in Naha, Okinawa.
   Two of the rescued men died, and one crewman was still missing at
dusk, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier reports said 17 crew members were missing and feared dead.
   All 20 of the Filipino crewmen had abandoned the ship, another
official said.
   The La Vie en Rose radioed for help after it began taking on
water in stormy seas Friday night, he said. The ship sank at 12:42
a.m. today.
   The Taiwanese coast guard alerted Japanese authorities, who
dispatched a search plane and a ship to the area, 170 miles east of
Taiwan and near the Okinawan island chain.
   The ship was headed for northern Japan with a cargo of Malaysian
tropical timber when it began taking on water, officials said.

   A protest strike in Armenia's capital shut down
public transport and most factories as residents continued to demand
unification with a predominantly Armenian region of a neighboring
republic, Pravda reported today.
   The Communist Party daily said the week-long general strike in
Yerevan was triggered by reports from the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
clashes between anti-riot police and Armenians that left seven
people hospitalized with injuries.
   Official media have reported no recent violence in
Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan since
1923, and it was not immediately possible to contact residents by
telephone from Moscow today to check the reports.
   ``An absolute majority'' of Armenians who gathered on Yerevan's
Opera Square supported the general strike as a sign of solidarity
with the ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, Pravda said.
   On Friday in Yerevan, Pravda said, ``beginning in the morning,
transport and the majority of factories and offices were not
working.'' There were also protest marches in the Armenian capital,
the newspaper said.
   Since February, Armenians in their republic and Nagorno-Karabakh
have been demanding the region be united with Armenia, and local
legislatures in both places approved the transfer of sovereignty.
   In July, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top executive
body, refused to alter the region's status, citing Azerbaijan's
constitutional right to veto any change in its territorial status.

<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legendary gossip columnist Sheilah
Graham, who reported the loves and lives of Hollywood's most
glittering stars, has died of heart failure at age 84.
   Ms. Graham, who lived in this exclusive oceanfront resort, died
Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach. She had
undergone two hip operations and suffered two heart attacks in
recent years, said her friend Celia Lipton Farris.
   ``She's the last of the great era that wrote about Hollywood
stars,'' said Ms. Farris.
   Raised in an orphanage, Ms. Graham found fame and fortune through
sheer pluck. Along the way she wrote 11 books and was romantically
involved with flamboyant Jazz Age novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald.
   With fellow columnists Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, she
formed what followers called the ``Unholy Trio,'' and captured
Hollywood's juiciest gossip in a no-holds-barred style.
   ``Joan Crawford had no right to be a mother,'' she once wrote in
the syndicated column she filed for 40 years. ``She was a
perfectionist and expected it of her children. She was always
cleaning something.''
   Ms. Graham reported on the time Bonzo the chimp nearly strangled
Ronald Reagan with his own tie, and the time Marilyn Monroe sang
``Happy Birthday'' to John F. Kennedy in Madison Square Garden.
   But her own life was as controversial as the people she wrote
about.
   Born Lily Sheil in London's East End on Sept. 15, 1904, Ms.
Graham at age 18 married a salesman 25 years her senior before
trying careers as a serious actress and a chorus girl.
   In 1933, she emigrated to New York to make her fortune. After
reporting for New York papers for two years, she left for Hollywood,
where she was courted by Howard Hughes and John Wayne and later met
Fitzgerald.
   Their affair ended after three years when Fitzgerald died of a
heart attack in 1940, collapsing at her feet. Ms. Farris said she
still frequently spoke of him, once lamenting: ``I won't be
remembered for my writing. I'll be remembered as Scott's mistress.''
   Ms. Graham's autobiography, ``Beloved Infidel,'' was later made
into a movie starring Deborah Kerr and Gregory Peck.
   Ms. Graham's survivors include a daughter, Wendy Fairey, a son,
Robert Westbrook, and three grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito, down to 66 pounds since he became
seriously ill two months ago, is so weak that he slept through a
visit today by his son, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old emperor has had no sign of blood discharges for
10 days, the longest such period since he fell ill with an
intestinal hemorrhage, the officials said. They reported him in
stable but weak condition.
   Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said Hirohito
slept through a visit by Crown Prince Akihito and his family,
although the emperor awoke later in the day.
   Doctors say they sometimes cannot tell if Hirohito is asleep or
awake, and that he sleeps much of the time. Reports Friday said he
had lost 37 pounds from his normal weight and is down to 66 pounds.
Maeda said his strength is waning and he speaks infrequently.
   Hirohito has received 42 pints in blood transfusions since the
onset of his illness.
   Palace officials refuse to comment on reports that Hirohito has
cancer.

   City officials acknowledge there was a
gap between concrete road barricades on a closed road where a car
plunged into a river, killing all four occupants, but they don't
know if anyone is to blame.
   Officials said Friday they did not know who moved the 2-ton
concrete barriers that would have prevented the car from going into
the water, or when they were pushed apart.
   The car was found by police divers in the Mill River on Thursday,
five days after four young friends from East Lyme disappeared during
a night out in New Haven. Their disappearance prompted a nationwide
search.
   Divers searched the river bottom after a patrolman noticed the
gap Wednesday, and public works crews closed the opening.
   The four victims drowned, the state medical examiner's office
said.
   Police said a case of mostly empty beer cans was found in the
car. But they said they did not know whether the results of
blood-alcohol tests would be released because they hadn't determined
who was driving.
   Police also were checking reports that the four, all under the
legal drinking age of 21, were served alcohol in several bars the
night they disappeared.
   Killed in the accident were three 19-year-olds, Laura
Lagrotteria, who worked at a pizza parlor; Jill Sawyer, a student at
the University of Rhode Island; and Christy Stevens, a student at
Mohegan Community College in Norwich; and Michael Gallo, 20, a
student at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven.
   The accident occurred on a dark stretch of road that was closed
last year because a 105-year-old pivoting bridge along it was beyond
repair. The bridge was left in its open position, parallel to the
river, so boats could pass by on either side.
   Mayor Biagio DiLieto and other city officials told reporters at a
news conference Friday that an investigation had confirmed that the
concrete road barriers at the open bridge had been moved, leaving a
gap wide enough for a car to pass through.
   One or more of the three 2-ton concrete blocks were out of place
when the car drove into the river, city officials said.
   The officials' claim that they had received no public complaints
about a gap in the barricade was disputed by a radio station's
traffic reporter, who said he passed on complaints from motorists
several times since March.
   Police found the blocks out of position after an Oct. 22 car
accident at the site, but city officials said they were not sure how
big a gap existed at that time. The accident was the third at the
barriers since the bridge was closed in August 1987.
   City officials said they are investigating why public works crews
put up wooden barriers after the Oct. 22 accident instead of
returning the blocks to their original position. Two barrier
stanchions were recovered from the river.
   Authorities also are investigating whether a detour sign was
incorrectly placed to send traffic down the closed street the night
of the crash. The sign was found in the incorrect position Thursday.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak said today that Egypt
recognizes the newly proclaimed Palestinian state and that PLO
leader Yasser Arafat will visit Cairo for talks on Middle East peace
strategy.
   Mubarak's announcement brought the number of countries
recognizing an independent Palestinian nation to 32.
   It was not immediately known whether the Egyptian recognition
would lead to diplomatic relations and the establishment of a
Palestinian embassy in Cairo.
   The PLO has an office in Cairo, but its mission is listed in the
Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic List in an annex separate from embassy
listings. The head of the mission is not an ambassador and does not
present credentials to the president.
   Egyptian recognition was certain to irritate Israel, which has
diplomatic relations with Egypt under their 1979 peace treaty, the
only one between an Arab country and the Jewish state. Israel
reacted angrily to recognition of the Palestinian state by Turkey
this week.
   Israel today had no immediate reaction to Mubarak's remarks. A
Foreign Ministry official said the reports from Cairo would be
checked before any response was made.
   Israel has mounted a diplomatic offensive against international
recognition of the Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
kicked it off Friday in a meeting with 60 diplomats from 42
countries.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile and
the policy-making body of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
declared an independent Palestinian homeland at its meeting in
Algiers.
   The independence declaration did not define the boundaries of the
future state, saying it would be determined by future negotiations.
   Col. Saeed Moussa, a Syrian-backed Palestinian leader, has called
for the creation of new PLO to replace Arafat's ``capitulationist
command,'' a Beirut newspaper reported today.
   Moussa, better known by the code-name of Abu Moussa, was quoted
by the independent daily An-Nahar as saying the council's
recognition of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 was
tantamount to treason.
   ``The resolutions carry implicit recognition of Israel,'' Moussa
was quoted as saying.
   A new PLO command, Moussa was quoted as saying, ``will carry out
the armed struggle against the Zionist enemy (Israel) until our
homeland is liberated.''
   Moussa broke from Arafat's PLO in 1983 and set up headquarters
for his Fatah-Uprising faction in the Syrian capital.
   Mubarak's statement appeared to upgrade two previous official
position statements, which expressed support for the Palestinian
state and termed the endorsement ``stronger than recognition.''
   ``Some countries cast doubts on our position when we said that we
supported the resolutions of the Palestine National Council and said
we did not recognize (the Palestinian state),'' Mubarak said in the
Nile Delta city of Benha.
   ``This is our cause. We are saying that we supported all the
council's resolutions, and this includes recognition of the
Palestinian state.''
   There was no explanation of the upgrading today of Cairo's
position to explicit recognition.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel Television
last Wednesday that if Egypt recognized the Palestinian state, it
would be ``deviating'' from the Camp David peace framework accords
concluded with Israel.
   The U.S.-mediated Camp David agreements provided for negotiations
to determine the final status of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza, where about 1.5 million Palestinians live. Rabin said
``unilateral action'' would breach that aspect of the accords.
   Mubarak said: ``I shall hear from Yasser Arafat about details of
the Palestinian council's resolutions when he visits Cairo. We also
will discuss future steps.''
   Egyptian newspapers reported Arafat was expected in Cairo today
for the opening of a five-day symposium on ``protection of religious
shrines and cultural heritage in Palestine.''
   Abdullah al-Hourani, a member of the PLO Executive Committee who
is attending the symposium, told reporters Arafat was unable to
arrive in time for the opening session but hoped to come ``within
the next few days.''
   The nations to have recognized the Palestinian state are:
Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Cuba, Cyprus, Egypt,
Gambia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya,
Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nicaragua, North and
South Yemen, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore,
Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia.

   Thunderstorms with heavy rains and gusty winds lingered in parts
of Arkansas, Tennessee and the lower Ohio Valley today, and snow
blanketed eastern New Mexico.
   The storms in Arkansas pelted Little Rock with 7 inches of rain,
breaking the city's previous record of 1.91 inches for the date
Friday.
   Heavy rains produced reports of flooding in several Arkansas
counties, where high water forced the closing of some roads.
   Strong winds blew down trees, damaged a public school's roof and
a mobile home, and downed power lines in various Arkansas
municipalities.
   Rain and some snow developed in eastern New Mexico. By Friday
evening, 9 inches of snow had fallen at Gallup in western New Mexico.
   Snow also fell in the southern foothills of the Colorado Rockies,
leaving up to 5 inches.
   A band of snow developed from southwest Minnesota into northwest
Wisconsin. Up to 4 inches was expected today.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in eastern
Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley;
thunderstorms, possibly severe, from eastern Texas across Louisiana
and southern Arkansas into western Mississippi; rain spreading
across the central Appalachians, the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes
states, the middle Mississippi Valley, eastern Kansas and Oklahoma;
snow from the Oklahoma Panhandle to western Kansas and from southern
Minnesota to northwest Wisconsin; and rain and mountain snow in the
Pacific Northwest.
   Predicted highs: upper 20s to near 32 degrees from northern
Minnesota across North Dakota and eastern Montana; mid-30s to the
40s from New England across the Great Lakes to the upper Mississippi
Valley, as well as South Dakota, the central Plains, Oklahoma, the
Texas Panhandle, the Rockies, and the Pacific Northwest; 50s to low
70s in California and the desert Southwest; and 70s and low 80s in
southeast Texas, the central Gulf of Mexico states and Florida. The
rest of the nation should generally be in the 50s and 60s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 3 degrees at
Devils Lake, N.D., to 80 degrees at Homestead (Fla.) Air Force Base
and Key West, Fla.

   The B-1B bomber that crashed at Ellsworth
Air Force Base had passed a three-hour inspection ordered for the
fleet after another B-1B bomber crashed in Texas, Air Force
officials said.
   Brig. Gen. Robert Marquette Jr. said Thursday's crash probably
will not force another grounding of the nation's fleet of advanced
jet bombers.
   Marquette, commander of the 12th Air Division at Ellsworth, said
Friday that a permanent team is being assembled to study the crash.
   The four crewmen parachuted to safety Thursday night, but the
$280 million plane was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at
Ellsworth during a routine training flight. One crew member suffered
a back injury.
   ``The crew is in relatively good shape,'' Marquette said.
   Thursday's crash came two days after officials reported that the
Air Force had inspected and cleared more than two-thirds of the 98
B-1B bombers, which were grounded briefly after the Nov. 8 crash
that destroyed a plane in Texas.
   The plane that crashed Thursday was cleared for flight on Monday.
   Marquette said air operations at Ellsworth have been suspended
until the debris has been fully examined.
   Marquette refused to speculate on the cause of the crash, but
said there was no evidence of an engine fire.
   The bomber was trying to land when it crashed at 10:40 p.m.,
toppling a utility pole that cut off power to two schools and a
residential area.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted sources as
saying preliminary reports indicated the pilot misjudged his
approach and was preparing to land far short of the Ellsworth
runway. The paper's sources said it was unclear whether the
miscalculation resulted from a human error or a malfunction in the
bomber's sophisticated flight aid systems.
   The newspaper's sources said the pilot, realizing a crash was
imminent, pulled the nose of the plane up, giving the crew time to
eject safely.
   The Post also reported that sources said initial reports
suggested that the B-1B crash in Texas was caused by a broken fuel
line that spewed fuel over the engine, causing it to burst into
flames.

   How many city workers does it take to screw in a
light bulb?
   About two dozen if you have 19,800 light bulbs, the Parks
Department here found out.
   To light up the city's new Westlake Park for the holidays, the
department ordered 792 strings of Christmas lights, each with 25
bulbs _ but the strands came with 25 empty sockets.
   The Chicago supplier shipped the bulbs separately so they
wouldn't break, said Jeff Sandoz, an administrative assistant in the
department.
   Sandoz handed out bulbs and strands to fellow workers for several
days, and about 7,800 bulbs had been installed during staff meetings
and by receptionists between phone calls.
   About two dozen Parks Department employees met in a city
cafeteria for an hour and a half Thursday to screw in the last
12,000 bulbs or so.
   Next week, a Christmas tree will be lit at Westlake Center, along
with the strands of lights at the adjacent park _ thanks to lots of
finger-twisting by city workers.

   Some city employees have been seeing
less of each other in the past few months, but not because they're
staying away from work.
   It's just that there's less of them to see.
   City Assessor George Bratcher decided in March that he needed to
drop some of his 215 pounds. When he succeeded in getting down to
155, he inspired some fellow employees.
   Finance Director Stanley Chubinski lost 25 pounds with his diet.
``I plan on starting it again after Thanksgiving,'' he said.
   Another employee who is putting off dieting until after the
holiday is account clerk Barbara Jones of the finance department.
She wants to lose another 10 pounds after Thanksgiving.
   ``In four weeks, I lost 14 pounds,'' she said. ``My doctor said I
should slow down a little, so I went to 3 pounds a week, then went
off it for a while.''
   ``Every week, someone new yells at me in the hall, `I've lost
another pound,''' Bratcher said.
   ``I'm on my third belt,'' he went on. ``All of my clothes have
been altered twice and are too big now, but I'm not going to alter
them again.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of protesters shouting
``Execute Chun Doo-hwan'' were dispersed by riot police firing tear
gas today as they marched through the city to denounce the former
president.
   Fighting began when riot police in green combat fatigues and
black, visored helmets blocked 5,000 dissidents, students and
workers who tried to march after a rally to call for Chun's
punishment for alleged corruption.
   Students tried to force their way through police lines and
troopers used tear gas grenades to drive them back. Screaming
protesters then pelted police with hundreds of firebombs and showers
of rocks.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Oust (President) Roh Tae-woo,''
protesters yelled as they battled unsucessfully to break through
police lines.
   Protesters later reassembled in the center of Seoul where columns
of marchers paraded through the streets with banners and flags,
yelling slogans and shooting their fists into the air.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, estimated 12,000 people
took part in the protests. Peaceful anti-Chun rallies were held in
the provincial cities of Chongju, Kwangju, Taego and Chonju.
   Some protesters in Seoul yelled anti-American slogans, charging
the United States had backed military rule in South Korea. ``Yankee
go home,'' they yelled.
   Riot police lining the streets intervened when thousands of
protesters tried to approach City Hall. Police armored vans with
multiple tear gas launchers fired volleys of canisters into the
marchers, sending people running to escape the choking fumes.
   Students with firebombs and rocks attacked police buses, trying
to set them on fire before troopers drove them off. Other protesters
tore up sidewalk paving stones to make rocks to throw at police and
hurled firebombs.
   Other large columns of protesters marched in other parts of the
city center, skirmishing a few times with police.
   Authorities fielded 15,000 riot police in Seoul after dissident
groups called for nationwide protests to demand the arrest of Chun.
The former president has been accused of corruption and human rights
abuses and some of his associates and relatives have been convicted
or charged.
   Dissident leaders also called for the overthrow of President Roh,
charging his government was a front for continued military rule.
   Police had no word on arrests or injuries today.
   Some onlookers cheered and applauded the protesters in Seoul, but
most people just watched silently as marchers passed by shouting
anti-government slogans and singing radical songs.
   On Friday, aides of the former president said Chun will
apologize, give most of his wealth to the government and leave Seoul
in an effort to quiet public protests about his alleged involvement
in corruption.
   A four-day parliamentary hearing opened into Chun's role in the
bloody suppression of an uprising in the southern city of Kwangju in
1980.
   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the former
president would announce his decision at a news conference next
week. ``He will make a public apology, give up most of his wealth
and live in seclusion somewhere in the countryside,'' the aide said.
   Another said Chun would live in an isolated, rented house in
central South Korea instead of going to his hometown in the south,
where he is no longer welcome. Living in rural seclusion is a
traditional way of repentance for disgraced Korean leaders.
   The mass-circulation paper Hankook Ilbo, quoting an unidentified
government source, said Roh is expected to pardon him if Chun
carries out the plan.
   Nine members of Chun's family, including two brothers, have been
arrested on corruption charges. Chun is accused of amassing a
fortune and sending some of it for investment in the United States
and Australia.
   His wealth is not known, but one estimate has put it at $6
million, including a $1.4 million home in Seoul.

   Small plane crashes in New York, Texas and Arkansas killed 12
people, including seven who died when a twin-engine plane crashed as
it tried to land in a heavy thunderstorm in Batesville, Ark.
   In addition, lightning struck a TWA jetliner 50 miles from Little
Rock, Ark.'s airport Friday, and a huge fuel spill at San
Francisco's airport forced delays and diversions for hundreds of
flights.
   Roger Williams, a dispatcher for the Independence County
Sheriff's Department in Arkansas said the Beechcraft King Air
turboprop ``had made one approach and missed the Batesville airport
and they were attempting a second time'' when it crashed just after
6 p.m. Friday, about 12 miles west of the airport. The remote crash
site is some 90 miles northeast of Little Rock.
   The flight originated at Orange, Texas, outside Houston, said
Wayne Beckmann, duty officer at the Federal Aviation
Administration's southwest regional office in Fort Worth.
   Arkansas was under a flash flood watch when the crash occurred
during a heavy thunderstorm.
   ``The weather was about as bad as you can get,'' Williams said.
``The officers at the scene said it was raining, and so foggy you
couldn't see the ground.''
   The identities of the victims were not immediately released.
   Elsewhere, three people were killed when a single-engine
Beechcraft Bonanza apparently lost power shortly after takeoff from
a Shirley, N.Y., airport, authorities said. The plane had reached an
altitude of about 200 feet before it crashed near the Brookhaven
Airport on Long Island, said Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman.
   In Fort Worth, Texas, two people were killed when their
single-engine Cessna 150 crashed on a highway near Meacham Field.
   The TWA jet, en route to Little Rock from St. Louis with 76
passengers, was struck by lightning about 50 miles from the Arkansas
airport, authorities said.
   ``There was a large bolt of lightning, almost like a white,
yellow flash,'' said James Earl Wilson, a passenger on the DC-9.
``It seemed almost immediately like we lost some power. I was
concerned that maybe the engine went out.''
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said lightning struck the plane's left
wing about 10:30 a.m., damaging a metal section that controls
elevation. The jet landed safely at Little Rock about 26 minutes
later, Morrison said.
   Passengers on the plane were shaken but unhurt.
   At San Francisco International Airport, hundreds of passengers
faced major travel delays through this morning after a broken jet
fuel pipeline disrupted more than 200 flights.
   Many incoming flights were diverted to a half-dozen airports
throughout the West Coast, and some departing flights were delayed
several hours, said airport spokesman Ron Wilson.
   Contractors broke a 12-inch underground fuel line near the TWA
terminal about 4:30 p.m. Friday , effectively shutting off supplies
to all three terminals, Wilson said.
   Fuel service was restored about two hours later to most of the
airport, said Jennifer Donohue, of the airport's public affairs
department. Delays were expected to continue through this morning.

   The operator of the Seabrook nuclear power
plant says President Reagan's order allowing a federal agency to
devise evacuation plans for such plants comes too late to help that
troubled plant get a license.
   But Seabrook critics think the executive order will give
utility-written evacuation plans the authority they now lack.
   The order, signed Friday by Reagan, allows the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to develop and carry out evacution plans for
nuclear plants when state and local governments refuse to cooperate
in the emergency planning.
   The $5.7 billion Seabrook project, completed two years, has been
unable to win a commercial license due to opposition from
neighboring Massachusetts, where six communities fall within
Seabrook's 10-mile evacuation zone.
   Seabrook officials said Friday the order does not affect the
plant, because it already received federal permission to submit its
own evacuation plans for the Massachusetts communities.
   ``We just find it hard to believe that there's much in this plan
that would help us right now. Maybe it would have two years ago,''
said Ron Sher, a spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, Seabrook's
operator.
   But Paul McEachern, a longtime Seabrook foe and the unsuccessful
Democratic gubernatorial candidate this year, said the major flaw in
utility-submitted plans is that utilities lack the authority to
effectively carry them out. The order, however, gives FEMA that
authority, he said.
   ``It fills that very large gap that's left with utility-sponsored
plans,'' McEachern said. ``Public Service Company of New Hampshire
(Seabrook's lead owner) doesn't have police powers in the state of
Massachusetts. FEMA can be empowered by the president for that.''
   The executive order was received skeptically by the Dukakis
administration in Massachusetts, which maintains that local
governments are best able to answer citizens' concerns about nuclear
safety.
   ``We can't comment specifically on the order because we haven't
seen it, but our position has been and continues to be that it is
state and local officials who know how to best protect our
citizens,'' Martie Barnes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, said Friday in Boston.
   McEachern speculated that the Reagan administration anticipated
the legal challenge to Seabrook's evacuation plans by Massachusetts,
including the state's argument that Seabrook's owners lack the
authority to execute the plans.
   ``He wouldn't have signed the executive order unless he had to,
because it's going to be met with hostility from the New Hampshire
delegation,'' McEachern said.
   Gov.-elect Judd Gregg, an outgoing congressman, and Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., strongly opposed the order when it came to light
earlier this year. Neither returned telephone calls seeking comment
Friday night.
   Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H., said the final version seems slightly
weaker than the wording in the original draft, ``much more
conciliatory.'' He said he supports the thrust of the order, because
he feels the federal government must step in when state or local
governments try to block a plant's licensing.
   Another Seabrook critic, Jane Doughty of the Seacoast
Anti-Pollution League, predicted a legal battle over the order.
   ``I'm sure the intervenors in the (Seabrook) case will do
something about it, because Congress did not change the laws, and
clearly they did not intend that the federal government should usurp
state and local planning,'' she said.
   Until recently, states were required to submit an acceptable
evacuation plan as part of the NRC licensing process. Because of
opposition to Seabrook by Massachusetts and to the Shoreham plant on
Long Island by New York Gov.Mario Cuomo, the NRC has accepted _ but
not approved _ evacuation plans for both plants written by their
utility owners. Both plans face legal challenges.
   Shoreham was completed in 1984 but never received a commercial
operating license because of the dispute over the evacuation plan.
   In the face of that, its builder, the Long Island Lighting Co.,
last spring reached a preliminary agreement with the state to
abandon the plant in return for the state's approval of a
compensation plan for the utility. That plan awaits action by the
New York Legislature.
   Jerry Mikorenda, a spokesman for LILCO, said Reagan's order
``resolves questions of legal authority'' and ``reaffirms our
position,'' though he said the utility will continue with its plan
to sell and close the plant.
   Terry Lynam, spokesman for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said the
governor was not surprised by the order ``because the (Reagan)
administration is determined to get the plant open.'' Cuomo is
opposed to the licensing of Shoreham.
   Lynam said Cuomo made his opposition to the pending executive
order known in an Aug. 4 letter to Reagan.

<HEAD>Public Deceptions Cited With Annual `Doublespeak Awards'</HEAD>

   From a plane crash described as an
``uncontrolled contact with the ground'' to a patient's death called
a ``diagnostic misadventure of high magnitude,'' the nation's
English teachers have recognized the year's worst ``doublespeak.''
   ``We're corrupting what language is supposed to do, and that's
communicate,'' said William Lutz, who headed the public doublespeak
committiee of the National Council of Teachers of English, based in
Urbana, Ill. ``We cannot function without language.''
   First prize in the 1988 Doublespeak awards went to U.S. military
officials for their explanations of the July 3 downing of an Iranian
airliner by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf.
   Lutz said that both official reports and a news conference on the
incident were filled with ``the doublespeak of omission, distortion,
contradiction and misdirection.''
   The report censored essential information and did not contain
``something as basic and important as a map showing the course, over
time, of the Vincennes, its sister ships, the Iranian airliner and
the gunboats.''
   Even so, Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci told the public,
``We chose not to withhold anything,'' said Lutz.
   An anonymous Reagan administration official captured second place
for denying that the administration had covered up Honduran military
officials' involvement in drug crimes.
   The spokesman said: ``It wasn't that there was a cover-up. It's
just that people knew certain questions shouldn't be asked.''
   Third place went to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for his statement
that ``capital punishment is our society's recognition of the
sanctity of human life.''
   The 5,000 workers at a Chrysler AMC plant may have thought a new
``career alternative enhancement program'' had an enticing ring to
it _ until they found out their plant was closing and they were out
of jobs.
   Though nearly impossible to pick a favorite doublespeak, Lutz
said a stockbroker's description of the October 1987 crash as a
``fourth quarter equity retreat'' deserved recognition for ``sheer
chutzpah.''
   He also mentioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
description of cows, pigs and chickens as ``grain-consuming animal
units,'' and a department store's description of a security
policeman as a ``loss prevention specialist.''
   While some examples of doublespeak are funny, others deal with
deadly serious topics.
   In Philadelphia, doctors at a hospital later closed for gross
mismanagement described one patient's death as a ``diagnostic
misadventure of a high magnitude.''
   ``They killed the guy,'' said Lutz, a professor at Rutgers
University. ``They perforated his colon and he died.''
   Doublespeak allows officials ``to talk about something without
really talking about it,'' said Lutz.
   ``I'm just overwhelmed by the stuff,'' he said. ``It's coming in
waves. I'm getting so much I can't even print it all.''
   He advised the public to fight back.
   ``Reject it. What do you do when you buy a toaster and it's
broken? Take it back. Think of yourself as a consumer of language.''

   Hundreds of thousands of chanting
Serbs rallied today to back demands by their ambitious Communist
Party leader Slobodan Milosevic for more control over the troubled
southern province of Kosovo.
   ``We will not give up Kosovo,'' the massive crowd chanted as
Milosevic and other speakers denounced the alleged nationalism of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority and indirectly attacked other
opponents of the Serbian leader.
   In Pristina, Kosovo's capital, tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians defied appeals from provincial and national Communist
Party leaders to stay home and roamed city streets, shaking their
fists and chanting anti-Milosevic slogans.
   It was the third straight day of street protest in Pristina,
where trouble began Thursday after pressure from Milosevic forced
the resignation of two of the most popular Communist leaders from
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
   One of the ousted leaders, Azem Vlasi, met at least 20,000
students and workers gathered in a Pristina sports hall and begged
them to return home.
   ``Without Azem, there will be no unity,'' chanted the crowds in
the streets outside. ``We too are the people,'' the protesters
shouted, challenging Milosevic's claim that rallies backing his
demands represent the popular will.
   The apparently organized shows of strength by both sides in the
long-simmering dispute over Kosovo culminated in today's Belgrade
rally, the biggest of dozens orchestrated by Milosevic supporters in
recent months.
   ``No power can halt'' the fight for Kosovo started by the
rallies, Milosevic told the cheering Belgrade crowd.
   ``We enter this battle as we enter all battles _ to win,'' he
proclaimed.
   Organizers claimed 1.3 million people converged on Belgrade for
the rally, which Milosevic called the biggest gathering in the city
since hundreds of thousands of people celebrated liberation from the
Nazis on Oct. 20, 1944.
   Belgrade television put the figure at 800,000, while foreign
observers said the number was considerably lower. Police had no
immediate estimate.
   Milosevic, who told foreign reporters today's rally was ``very
important,'' is pressing for changes in the 1974 constitution which
gave Kosovo broad autonomy. The Serbian leader argues this is the
only way to protect Kosovo's Serb and Montenegrin minority against
alleged harassment from the ethnic Albanian majority in the
province, which borders communist Albania and was the heart of
Serbia's medieval empire.
   Serbs also frequently claim that the ethnic Albanians want to
unite with neighboring communist Albania.
   Chants of ``Slobo, Slobo, Slobodo,'' resounded through the crowd
on the banks of the Sava River as Milosevic appeared at the rally on
a giant tribune flanked by Serbian and Yugoslav national flags and
topped with a portrait of communist Yugoslavia's founding father,
Josip Broz Tito.
   ``Slobo'' is short for Milosevic's first name, while ``Slobodo''
means freedom in Serbian.
   To his supporters, Milosevic is ``the second Tito,'' the strong
leader Yugoslavia needs to guide it out of political and economic
crisis.
   Critics fear Milosevic's drive for more Serbian control over
Kosovo will lead to an increased Serbian dominance in the country,
which is a loose federation of six republics and Serbia's provinces
of Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   In a 15-minute speech that ended the 90-minute rally, Milosevic
invoked powerful memories of Serbia's victorious struggles against
the Germans in World War I and World War II and compared these to
the current struggle for Kosovo.
   But he also appealed twice to Kosovo's ethnic Albanians ``to
unite against evil and hatred, against chauvinists ... who shame
their people'' and to share in the ``peaceful dream'' of a Kosovo
where children from the ethnic Albanian majority and Serb minority
could play together in peace.
   Milosevic also made a strong pitch for a series of economic and
political reforms the Communist Party leadership has designed to try
to solve an unprecedented economic crisis that has helped fuel the
recent ethnic unrest.
   Columns of well-marshaled demonstrators waving flags, chanting
slogans and singing nationalist Serbian songs moved through
Belgrade's city center from the early morning. At least 50,000 were
brought in on free trains and buses.
   Free food and warm drinks were handed out to participants, who
also had free kindergartens available for their children.
   There also were strong if indirect attacks on the liberal
northern republic of Slovenia, whose Communist Party leaders have
accused Milosevic of using neo-Stalinist tactics to whip up popular
support for his policies.
   People who denounce the armed forces or Serbian policies are
``anti-Yugoslav,'' said Belgrade Communist Party leader Rados
Smilkovic in a broadside at the Slovene leadership.
   There has been vocal criticism of the army in Slovenia.

<TEXT>
   Pakistanis voted today for four
provincial assemblies, three days after Benazir Bhutto's party
captured the largest bloc of seats in National Assembly balloting.
   Humayun Khan, Election Commission spokesman, said after the polls
closed today that turnout appeared to be slightly under 50 percent.
   ``It was very peaceful. There were some scuffles at one or two
places but that's almost to be expected,'' he said.
   The police and military had prepared for possible violence but
the second phase of Pakistan's first free elections in 11 years
passed with no serious incidents. At stake were 460 Moslem and 23
non-Moslem seats in the provinces of Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan and
North West Frontier.
   The provincial assemblies are similar to state legislatures in
America. The National Assembly, elected Wednesday, is the lower
house of Parliament.
   In Pakistan, where the presidential election is indirect, the
Senate, or upper house of Parliament; the National Assembly; and the
four provincial assemblies form the electoral college to elect the
president. The provinces also provide the power base for the federal
government in Islamabad.
   Results of today's elections will not be known until Sunday but
observers predicted local and ethnic parties would emerge strongly.
   Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan People's Party is strongest in
the populous provinces of Sind and Punjab, but parties such as the
socialist People's National Party have their biggest following in
arid Baluchistan and the rugged frontier province. Ms. Bhutto will
be seeking a further validation of her party's nationwide popularity
in the provincial voting.
   In the National Assembly vote on Wednesday, Ms. Bhutto's party
won 92 of 215 seats at stake.
   Her conservative rivals, the Islamic Democratic Alliance, polled
55 seats, the last being awarded late Friday after officials
resolved a dispute in the Chakwal district of Punjab. The remaining
68 seats went to independents, minor parties and non-Moslem
candidates.
   Ms. Bhutto won a plurality but not a majority in the new
legislature. However, she claimed Friday she had been assured enough
support from other elected candidates to command more than half the
seats of the assembly.
   She refused to divulge numbers or give details of her support,
but if correct, Ms. Bhutto could become prime minister.
   The mandate to form a government must come from president Ghulam
Ishaq Khan but he has not indicated when he will act. Under the
constitution, he could wait until the National Assembly is sworn in,
which must occur by Dec. 16.

   Singers Smokey Robinson, Billy Eckstine Daryl Hall
and John Oates are leading a parade of stars celebrating the
reopening of the 60-year-old Fox Theater after an $8.1 million
restoration.
   The Count Basie Orchestra also was scheduled to perform tonight
in the 5,100-seat ``temple of amusement,'' as the Fox was called
when it first opened.
   ``I'm amazed that we've taken the Fox this far,'' said Ray
Shepardson, a theater consultant. ``It not only looks like 1928, it
is 1928.''
   The theater was home to a children's dancing school and a nightly
talent revue in its early years.
   During World War II, shows were held at 2 a.m. for night-shift
workers at war plants. Later, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed
six shows a day during a stint at the Fox in 1951. The theater
gradually fell into disrepair, however.
   New owner Mike Ilitch is putting the headquarters for his Little
Caesar International pizza company in a 10-story office building
next to the Fox. The theater and office building are expected to key
a major redevelopment of the downtown area.

<HEAD>Yeutter Fails To Head Off European Ban Of U.S. Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade representative, Clayton
Yeutter, said today he failed to persuade EEC officials to cancel a
ban on imports of hormone-treated meat from the United States
beginning in 1989.
   He reiterated that if the ban takes effect on Jan 1 as scheduled,
the United States will retaliate against EEC imports.
   ``We should never consider the door closed,'' Yeutter said,
``(but) I saw nothing in those talks yesterday that would indicate
that there was any hope of having the ban delayed.''
   He and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng talked to
reporters after discussing the proposed meat ban and other
trans-Atlantic trade issues Friday and today with officials at the
European Economic Community head office.
   Yeutter also criticized proposed West German subsidies for
Daimler-Benz AG to protect it from foreign exchange risks due to its
assumption of a stake in Airbus Industrie SA, the European aircraft
consortium.
   ``We believe that sets a very unfortunate precedent. Companies
should cover their own exchange rate risk,'' he said.
   Daimler-Benz has approved a government proposal that it take a 30
percent stake in Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH, a
state-controlled aerospace company. In return, Bonn will give up to
4.3 billion Deutsche marks ($2.4 billion) in subsidies to protect
Daimler-Benz against foreign exchange risks resulting from MBB's
37.9 percent stake in Airbus.
   ``We are exceedingly displeased that exchange rate guarantees''
were given, Yeutter said. ``If ... West Germany begins to provide
exchange rate guarantees to its business firms, there will be great
pressure on its government and on other governments to provide
corresponding exchange rate guarantees.''
   The EEC Commission has yet to examine if the subsidies breach the
EEC's antitrust rules.
   On Jan. 1, the Common Market will ban imports of meat treated
with growth-boosting hormones arguing the use of hormones causes
cancer. Yeutter and Lyng said there is no scientific evidence for
the ban on health grounds.
   The ban has been delayed by a year to allow for a compromise
solution which has not emerged. If the ban remains, the United
States will retaliate against the EEC. Yeutter said retaliation
might be reduced if the Common Market exempts from its ban imports
of hormone-treated meat used as pet food.
   ``If the EEC wishes to exempt pet food ... we would be pleased
with that outcome. That would not resolve the fundamental issue but
it would reduce the amount of retaliation.''
   U.S. retaliation would affect $100 million dollars of EEC exports
to the United States of, among other items, meat, instant coffee,
tomatoes, fruit juices and low-alcohol beverages.
   That matches the value of meat the EEC imports from the United
States annually. If pet food were exempted, retaliation could be cut
to $85 million worth of Common Market exports, Yeutter said. The EEC
ban was imposed under pressure from consumer groups and the European
Parliament.

<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi says his
anti-Marxist guerrillas and Cuban forces in Angola are observing an
informal cease-fire and conducting negotiations while awaiting the
outcome of regional peace talks.
   Savimbi told reporters at his bush headquarters Friday that a
delegation of his National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, or UNITA, met Aug. 26 in the Ivory Coast with
representatives of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   UNITA is backed by the United States and South Africa.
   The purpose of the talks was to turn over two of the 17 Cuban
officers captured by UNITA during fighting against Angola's
Cuban-and Soviet-backed Marxist government. But Savimbi said the
delegates also arranged ``a tacit understanding that if we don't
harass them, they won't attack us.''
   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, Savimbi said he
has agreed to a U.S. proposal to provide food to civilians on the
government side of the Angolan civil war. The guerrilla leader said
his only condition is that Americans should be allowed into northern
Angola to make sure the food goers to civilians and not government
soldiers.
   Savimbi said President-elect George Bush had promised him before
and after the U.S. election that American support to UNITA would
continue until the Soviets stop supplying the government and 50,000
Cuban troops leave the nation. At the news conference, Savimbi said
Castro has asked for a further meeting at which a system of
communications will be discussed so that UNITA guerrillas know if
Cubans are part of a government convoy and can avoid attacking them.
   He said Cubans have not attacked his forces ``for some time'' but
claimed Soviet personnel had engaged in fighting.
   ``The Cubans are staying behind. They are not playing a major
role. They are not visible,'' said Savimbi.
   He also said South African President P.W. Botha had invited him
to a meeting in Pretoria on Wednesday to discuss a U.S.-mediated
peace plan designed to get Cuban troops out of Angola and end South
African rule over South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. On
Friday, the Angolan and Cuban governments formally approved the
tentative peace accord. South Africa's Cabinet is expected to
discuss the matter in a few days.
   Negotiators from Angola, Cuba and South Africa, under U.S.
mediation, agreed Tuesday in Geneva to submit a timetable to their
respective governments for the redeployment to the north of the
country and ultimate pullout of the Cuban troops. South Africa says
agreement on a Cuban withdrawal is a precondition for allowing
independence for Namibia.
   Savimbi said he did not care how long the Cubans take to leave,
as long as they all go. He is confident that without Cuban support
the Marxist Angolan forces would have no choice but to negotiate
with him on a reconciliation government leading to free elections,
which he believes he would win.
   Savimbi said that, unlike anti-government rebels in Afghanistan
who have attacked the retreating Soviet army, his rebels would leave
departing Cuban troops alone. ``The best victory is to allow the
enemy to go,'' Savimbi said.
   UNITA has been fighting for a share of power since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The group's intelligence chief, Gen. Peregrino Wambo, said that
in the past month 48 UNITA soldiers had died, while the Angolan
government has lost 531 men and the Cubans 12.

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 12
Palestinians in the occupied territories today, hospital officials
said, during a general strike ordered by the underground leaders of
the uprising.
   Soldiers and stone-throwing Palestinians clashed after troops
raided villages near the West Bank's largest city of Nablus, Arab
news reports said.
   Five Palestinians, including a 65-year-old woman, received
gunshot wounds during a three-hour clash with troops in the Karawa
Beni Hassan village, an official at Al Ittihad hospital in Nablus
said.
   A 20-year-old Palestinian was seriously wounded in the chest in
the nearby Beit Furik village and six other Palestinians also were
shot in separate clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, hospital
officials said.
   In Nablus, soldiers fired live ammunition and tear gas to
disperse protesters, an Arab reporter said. There were no reported
injuries.
   The army said curfews were imposed on five refugee camps in Gaza
and that entry and exit from the Nablus area was being restricted.
Reports of Palestinian casualties were being checked, the army said.
   Businesses were shuttered and public transportation halted in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip during the strike called by the pro-PLO
United National Leadership of the Uprising, witnesses said.
   The strike was also endorsed by Moslem fundamentalists of the
Hamas, or Zeal, Movement to commemorate the slaying of Palestinian
resistance leader Sheikh Ezzedine Al Kassem 53 years ago by British
rulers.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8, 313 Palestinians and
11 Israelis have died. More than 7,000 Palestinians also have been
wounded.

   A Soviet parliamentary commission today said
Estonia's declaration of sovereignty runs counter to the
constitution in a ruling that could set the stage for a Kremlin
annulment of the Baltic republic's action.
   In Lithuania, another Soviet republic on the Baltic coast,
activists seeking more autonomy met to decide how to react to a
decision by local lawmakers not to directly challenge Moscow's
control, one activist said.
   In an apparent Kremlin effort to reassure the country's 15
constituent republics, the Council of Ministers met with their
representatives on economic power-sharing, official Radio Moscow
reported today.
   In India, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said this week's
challenge to Kremlin authority by Estonia was part of the process of
``perestroika,'' the name he has given his campaign for social and
economic reform.
   But a special commission of the Moscow-based Supreme Soviet
parliament that met today to discuss questions of constitutional and
political reform reacted strongly to Estonia's decision, calling it
unconstititional.
   The commission ruled that decisions adopted at Wednesday's
session of Estonia's parliament ``contain a range of provisions that
contradict the norms of the constitution of the U.S.S.R., on which
the Soviet socialist federation is founded,'' the official Tass news
agency said.
   Tass said the commission's conclusions were transmitted to the
Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top collegial executive body
that is headed by Gorbachev, in a move that could presage a striking
down of the Estonian decisions by the national leadership.
   Gorbachev spoke in New Delhi on the second day of a three-day
state visit to India. It was his first public reaction to a surge of
nationalism in Estonia and the two other Baltic republics, Lithuania
and Latvia.
   ``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem,'' he
said. ``The country is thinking over what is happening.'' Many
points are considered, ``but not all are constructive,'' Gorbachev
said. ``Some are purely emotional and this has been causing some
negative reactions.''
   But he added, ``What is happening in Estonia is perestroika.''
   The Estonian Parliament on Wednesday passed a declaration of
sovereignty in all but foreign and defense matters and a
constitutional amendment giving its own parliament the right to veto
Soviet laws.
   The Council of Ministers, led by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, met
Friday with the officials from the Soviet Union's 15 constituent
republics, Radio Moscow said. ``Speakers said a new economic
machinery must ensure a balanced combination of each republic and of
the nation in general,'' the radio said.
   The council set up a special commission to draw up guidelines for
reforming economic and social management between the central
government and the republics, Radio Moscow said.
   In Latvia on Friday, 50,000 people gathered in the capital, Riga,
to mark the 70th anniversary of pre-Soviet Latvian independence,
said Boris Sokolov of the Democratic Union, a fledgling opposition
party.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, today published a letter from
the state prosecutor in Latvia accusing the grass-roots People's
Front and some newspapers in Latvia of of seeking ``nationalist
isolation and separation.''
   Lithuania's parliament on Friday approved a measure making
Lithuanian the official language of the republic and embracing as
its flag that of pre-Soviet, independent Lithuania.
   But the legislators dropped a proposal for limited sovereignty
without a vote after the republic's party leader said Estonia's
declaration violated the Soviet constitution, official media
reported.
   ``People were scandalized'' when parliament dropped the
sovereignty plan without a vote, said one activist who stood on the
square outside all day listening to the live radio broadcast of the
parliament meeting.
   ``The people trusted them, and then they didn't even vote!'' said
the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the Lithuanian Communist Party chief, Algirdas
Brazauskas, returned from Moscow the night before the meeting and
told deputies they had no reason to confront Moscow when Estonia
already had lost the battle over sovereignty.
   The Soviet Presidium said Thursday that Estonia's claim of veto
power over Soviet laws conflicted with the Soviet constitution and
that the issue would be discussed with Estonian leaders at the next
meeting of the national Presidium. No date was given.
   In recent months, thousands of people in the Baltic republics
have joined grass-roots movements and have tried to use Gorbachev's
programs of social reforms as justification for their demands.
   The three republics were independent after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution until 1940. They were absorbed by the Soviet Union at
that time under a secret agreement between dictators Josef Stalin of
the Soviet Union and Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany.

   OPEC oil ministers today pressed for a

draw up a new production agreement and raise crude prices.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh held secret morning
talks with other ministers of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries at a luxurious hotel in Vienna.
   He spoke only briefly to reporters as he entered a hotel elevator
to go to his meeting with Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman and
other officials. Lukman also is president of the cartel. Asked if
there were any new developments, Aghazadeh replied, ``Maybe.''
   Aghazadeh and Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, the oil chief of
rival Iraq, met separately on Friday with other OPEC members to try
to break an impasse that has stalled cartel talks.
   The ministers were scheduled later today to resume formal
discussions in a joint session of two of the cartel's committees.
   On Friday, Aghazadeh told reporters that Iran refuses an Iraqi
demand that the two rival countries be allowed to produce an equal
amount of oil under a new cartel accord. ``I always reject parity,''
he said. The two nations are trying to rebuild after an eight-year
war that ended in August.
   The dispute between Iran and Iraq over oil production has stalled
efforts to draw up new production ceilings that would limit the
recent surge in output and give a lift to sagging oil prices.
   Also taking part in the behind-the-scenes negotiations today were
Oil Ministers Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, Julio Cesar Gil of
Venezuela, Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia and Ali Khalifa al-Sabah of
Kuwait.
   Indonesian Energy Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita gave the talks
a 50-50 chance of success.
   The ministers also met for about an hour Thursday evening in a
joint session of two cartel committees, officials said.
   Officials fear that failure to draw up a new accord will send
crude prices into a tailspin if cheating continues to add millions
of barrels of oil a day to an already glutted world market.
   Prices are running $4 or more below the cartel's benchmark of $18
a barrel.
   Analysts estimate Iraq has been producing at least 2.6 million
barrels a day, an amount that could hit 3.7 million barrels next
year with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the
Red Sea. Its quota under a 1986 agreement was 1.5 million barrels a
day
   Saudi Arabia has widened its output to more than 6 million
barrels a day, analysts estimate, well above its daily quota of 4.3
million barrels.
   Iran also is believed to have exceeded its quota of 2.4 million
barrels.
   Iraq in the past has refused to abide by the OPEC quota of 1986,
saying it wanted the same level given Iran. Iran has argued against
granting Iraq an equal share.
   Iraq had said during an OPEC meeting last month in Madrid, Spain,
that it would not accept a ceiling that was a barrel less than
Iran's.

<HEAD>Mubarak Expresses Support For Palestinian State</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Middle East News Agency
correcting its report to delete reference to recognition of
Palestinian state. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak today reaffirmed
support for an independent Palestinian state but again stopped short
of fully recognizing the newly proclaimed nation.
   The state-owned Middle East news agency initially quoted Mubarak
as expressing Egypt's ``recognition'' of the Palestinian state.
Later it amended its report, saying the word ``recognition'' was
incorrect and that Mubarak had only declared support for the
establishment of the state.
   ``There was a mistake on the desk here,'' said Adel Amer, an
assistant editor at the agency. He refused to elaborate.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed an independent state Tuesday at the end of a meeting in
Algiers, Algeria.
   That afternoon, an Egyptian government statement endorsed but did
not explicitly recognize the Palestinian state. On Thursday, Mubarak
stuck to the support formula but said it was ``stronger than
recognition.''
   At least 31 other nations, mainly Moslem, have recognized the
Palestinian state, and the Soviet Union has recognized the
proclamation while stopping short of full diplomatic recognition.
   In the original remarks reported by the Middle East News Agency,
Mubarak was quoted as saying:
   ``Some countries cast doubts on our position when we said that we
supported the resolutions of the Palestine National Council. They
said that we did not recognize (the Palestinian state). This is our
(Palestinian) cause. We are saying that we supported all the
council's resolutions, and this includes recognition of the
Palestinian state.''
   In its amended version, the news agency twice substituted the
word ``establishment'' for the word ``recognition,'' changing the
meaning of the sentence to an expression of support for the
Palestinian state.
   A few hours after Mubarak spoke today, Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid met with Arab ambassadors in Cairo. In remarks to
reporters afterward, he again characterized Egypt's position on the
Palestinian state as one of support.
   Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, the only one
between an Arab country and the Jewish state.
   Israel has mounted a diplomatic offensive against international
recognition of the Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
kicked it off Friday in a meeting with 60 diplomats from 42
countries.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel Television on
Wednesday night that if Egypt recognized the Palestinian state, it
would be ``deviating'' from the 1978 Camp David peace framework
accords concluded with Israel.
   The U.S.-mediated Camp David agreements provided for negotiations
to determine the final status of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza, where 1.5 million Palestinians live. Rabin said ``unilateral
action'' would breach that aspect of the accords.
   Mubarak said today that the Palestine National Council took
``very good decisions'' in accepting U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338.''
   ``All of these are excellent, advanced steps and should be
exploited in the forward push to settle the Palestinian problem,''
he said.
   Resolution 242 implicitly recognizes Israel's right to live in
peace within secure boundaries. Resolution 338 called for peace
negotiations ``under appropriate auspices'' and was the basis of a
proposal, strongly supported by the Arabs, for an international
conference.
   Mubarak said PLO chief Yasser Arafat would soon arrive in Cairo
for talks.
   ``I shall hear from Yasser Arafat about details of the
Palestinian council's resolutions when he visits Cairo. We also will
discuss future steps,'' Mubarak said. He did not say when the PLO
chairman will arrive.
   The nations to have recognized the Palestinian state are:
Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Cuba, Cyprus, Gambia,
India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nicaragua, North and South Yemen,
Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore, Sudan, Tunisia,
Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia.

   A teen-ager who claimed he beat a man to death
with an electric bass guitar in self-defense has been acquitted of
murder and manslaughter charges.
   Mark Douglas Troup Jr., 17, was found innocent Thursday in the
death of Russell ``Rusty'' Nies III, 26, of New Cumberland. Nies
died June 20, two days after the beating in a hallway outside
Troup's apartment.
   The two had fought over the return of property to a sister of
Nies' fiancee. Defense attorney Floyd P. Jones said Nies had
threatened Troup and wanted to fight.
   ``(Troup) did nothing more than you or I would do to defend
ourselves and protect our property,'' Jones said in closing
arguments.
   Marc A. Roberts, assistant district attorney, argued Troup went
beyond self-defense by continuing to strike Nies with the guitar
after he had been knocked down by the initial blow.
   ``Self-defense changed to pure rage and the intent to kill,''
Roberts said.
   Six or seven additional blows by Troup, two of which shattered
the back of the victim's skull, ``were neither necessary nor
reasonable,'' Roberts said.
   Troup still faces unspecified criminal charges as a juvenile.

   A teen-ager found locked inside a
giant commercial clothes dryer died after being tumbled and battered
in the machine for about 10 minutes, police said.
   Rafael Benitez, 18, of Huntington Park died Friday about four
hours after arriving unconscious at Los Angeles County-USC Medical
Center, said Lt. Dan Leili.
   The cause of death was apparently ``blunt force trauma,'' he
said, adding that the death wasn't accidental.
   ``He was trapped inside. It had to be latched from the outside.
It is being investigated as an attempted murder,'' Leili said.
   The unconscious youth was found inside the 10-foot-tall
front-loading dryer by a fellow employee at American Textile
Conditioner, a commercial dry-cleaning company, investigators said.
   ``The heat was on but they don't think it had anything to do with
the cause of death. He died from being bounced around inside,'' said
Sgt. Carl Heintz.
   Benitez was repeatedly struck in the head by the giant baffles
inside the dryer's circular drum.

<TEXT>
   Ninety-three high school students have
been suspended for three days after boycotting classes over the
cancellation of an annual Christmas candle-lighting ceremony.
   The local chapter of the National Honor Society organized a
protest Friday to persuade the Lee's Summit Board of Education to
reconsider last week's decision to suspend the holiday program held
since 1956.
   The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened to sue the
school district if the society-sponsored pageant, which depicted the
birth of Jesus, was held during school this year. The ACLU told
school officials the ceremony violated the Constitution's separation
of church and state.
   School board members voted 5-1 to cancel the ceremony after
district lawyers told them a legal challenege would be costly.
   About 2,400 of Lee's Summit High School's 2,600 students attended
a school-approved sit-in at the gymnasium during the first class
period Friday, but 200 to 250 students refused to return to class
when the protest was over less than an hour later.
   The students were told they could return to class for an
unexcused tardy or they would be suspended, school officials said.
Most returned to class, but 93 remained.
   The suspensions will begin Monday and last through Wednesday.

   Thousands of protesters calling for the
arrest and execution of former President Chun Doo-hwan battled
police Saturday with firebombs and rocks as they marched through
Seoul.
   Riot police fired tear gas and blocked streets to stop students,
workers and dissidents from marching on City Hall to demand
punishment of the former president for alleged corruption and human
rights abuses.
   ``Execute Chun Doo-hwan! Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!''
columns of marchers shouted as they paraded through the city center
after nightfall. ``Return stolen wealth to the people!'' they yelled.
   Police armored vans fired volleys of choking tear gas into the
ranks of the marchers to stop them from advancing on City Hall.
Students hurled firebombs and rocks at police in clashes that
swirled through the city center.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, estimated about 12,000
people took part in the protests. Hankook Ilbo, a leading Seoul
newspaper, estimated the number of protesters at 20,000.
   Smaller, peaceful protests involving at least 6,000 people were
reported in the provincial cities of Chongju, Kwangju, Taegu, Chonju
amd Pusan.
   Dissident groups had called for nationwide protests Saturday to
demand Chun's arrest for alleged abuses under his authoritarian
government. Protest leaders also called for the overthrow of
President Roh, contending he is a front for continued military rule.
   The Roh government is trying to defuse public anger against Chun,
a former general, without being implicated in the furor. Roh, also a
former general, was a close associate of Chun.
   Violence erupted in Seoul when riot police blocked about 5,000
people from marching to Chun's home after they held a rally at
Daehak-ro in central Seoul. Protesters tried to force their way
through police blocking the road, and troopers responded with tear
gas grenades.
   Screaming students carrying iron and wooden clubs hurled hundreds
of firebombs and rocks at police but were unable to break through
the wall of police shields.
   Protesters then filtered into the city center, where their
numbers swelled and several large columns marched through the main
shopping district. Marchers yelled slogans and sang songs as they
shot their fists into the air.
   Some protesters yelled ``Yankee go home!'' and other
anti-American slogans. Dissidents are opposed to the presense of
42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense
pact.
   Riot police opened fire with tear gas several times. Protesters
trying to reach City Hall were driven back twice.
   Angry students attacked police vehicles with firebombs, setting
fire to at least two, and attacked a police station. Protesters
broke up sidewalk paving stones to hurl at police. Fighting
continued in sidestreets for several hours.
   Police officials, who said about 15,000 riot police were fielded
in Seoul to block the protests, had no immediate word on arrests or
injuries.
   Some onlookers cheered or applauded the protesters, but many
people in the Saturday afternoon shopping crowds watched silently.
   Chun, who stepped down in February at the end of a seven-year
term, is expected to apologize to the nation and turn over a portion
of his wealth to the government to atone for alleged corruption
under his administration. Chun took power with military backing in
1980.
   The former president denies any personal wrongdoing, but several
of his relatives and associates have been convicted or charged with
corruption involving millions of dollars in official funds and
forced contributions from businesses.

   A leopard kept by a businessman to scare
off would-be thieves tore out of the building and pounced on a
3-year-old girl, severely slashing her throat, officials and news
reports said Saturday.
   Doctors said the girl would survive the attack, which occurred
Friday in downtown Palermo.
   The owner of the leopard said he kept the animal in his shipping
business office, Italian media reported. State television reported
that the owner had a license for the leopard.
   The leopard was out of its cage, which was being cleaned, the
Italian news agency ANSA said.
   The car apparently pounced on the office door, forcing it open,
when he saw the girl pass by, dashed out onto the sidewalk and
jumped upon her. The owner managed to pull the leopard away, ANSA
reported.
   ANSA reported that the animal's owner, Diego Riggi, was charged
with causing serious injury.

   People in this arctic town had a few
minutes to catch a glimpse of the sun Saturday before it disappeared
for 65 days, leaving Barrow in virtual darkness.
   The sun rose at 1:04 p.m. and set 16 minutes later. It will
appear again on Jan. 23, at 1:09 p.m.
   Temperatures already have been well below zero in Barrow, and the
absence of the sun won't make the community of 1,500 residents much
colder. Feeble solar radiation during the arctic autumn is no match
for the cooling effects of permafrost, ice and snow, said Chuck
Evans, manager of the U.S. Weather Service station here.
   People don't seem disturbed about the long periods of darkness,
Evans said.
   ``We've had a lot of them come up and worry about it the first
year,'' he said. ``But so far it's not really affected anyone.''
   But he said the lack of light can restrict weather station
operations. For one thing, it's hard to observe cloud movements when
it is dark.
   Darkness causes some people to suffer a malady known as Seasonal
Affective Disorder, or SAD, with symptoms including lethargy,
inability to concentrate, depression and increased appetite, said
North Slope Borough Health Department spokeswoman Mary O'Connor.
   In the Soviet Union, officials send children from dark areas to
brighter regions for at least a week during the winter. Soviet
children also are exposed to full-spectrum lighting for at least 10
minutes a day, she said.
   People unable to escape the darkness can be helped by certain
colors, O'Connor said.
   ``Yellow is more up, an energizing color,'' she said, but blue
tends to have a tranquilizing effect.
   While some people in Barrow use tips about colors and fill their
homes with potted plants to help them deal with the darkness, others
say the winter conditions are a way of life and require no
adjustment.
   ``After seeing the sun set like that for 74 years, what more can
I say?'' said Maggie Gray, a Barrow elder. She goes about her daily
rounds, whether it's light or dark outside.

   Narcotics officers Saturday arrested six people
and seized 39 pounds of heroin worth about $18 million, a senior
police official reported.
   Superintendent Chris Cantley told reporters the high-grade heroin
was found inside two bags after a man was arrested outside a house
in a village near the border with China.
   He said police arrested two other men and two women inside the
house and found four pistols during a search.
   In a follow-up raid at another house, police detained a man who
was found to have a suitcase containing about $400,000 in U.S.
currency, Cantley said.
   He said police believe the money was the proceeds of a drug deal
in the United States.
   The suspects, whose names were not disclosed, had been under
police surveillance for two months, Cantley said.

   Voting proceeded without violence today
in the provincial election in eastern Sri Lanka, where Tamil
guerrillas had threatened to disrupt balloting, officials and
residents reported.
   Lakshman Perera, a deputy election commissioner, said no violent
incidents had been reported. He said about 40 percent of the 600,000
people eligible to vote cast their ballots.
   Indian and Sri Lankan soldiers maintained heavy security around
polling centers to ward off possible attacks by the guerrillas.
   Two Indian soldiers were killed Friday night when Tamil gunmen
attacked four police stations in the east, a Sri Lankan military
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the attacks were an attempt to disrupt today's elections. The
police stations were manned jointly by Sri Lankan forces and members
of India's peacekeeping force.
   Residents of Batticaloa, the provincial capital, said voter
turnout was poor in the morning but picked up later.
   Batticaloa, 136 miles east of Colombo, is in the heart of an area
that has been a constant flashpoint in the five-year Tamil
separatist war.
   The voters are to elect 35 members to a council joining
multiethnic Eastern Province with overwhelmingly Tamil Northern
Province. Northern Province had no election because factions agreed
last month to apportion the province's 36 seats. All candidates were
unopposed.
   The merged council, which will have limited administrative power,
was offered by the national government as an alternative to Tamil
militants' demand for a separate nation in the region.
   De Silva said election results would not be known until Sunday.
   The largest Tamil guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, has rejected the elections, calling them an Indian propaganda
ploy.
   In a telex from their office in London, the Tigers said the two
ex-guerrilla groups in the elections were ``mercenaries of the
government of India'' and ``can only only be described as traitors
who will never be forgiven.''
   The Tigers are fighting Indian peacekeeping troops who were sent
to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to disarm the guerrillas and enforce a
peace accord.
   The most militant Tamils say they need a separate state to
protect their ethnic minority from what they say is discrimination
by the Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils make up about 18 percent of the
population.
   Most Tamils are Hindus, but in the Batticaloa area many are
Christians whose ancestors were converted by Western missionaries.

   In addition to naming advisers at the highest
levels, President-elect George Bush must deal with a federal work
force of 3 million people that is too often underpaid, unmotivated
and demoralized, a congressional report contends.
   ``To a large extent, the government today is faced with a `people
problem','' the General Accounting Office said in one of a series of
``transition reports'' directed to Bush and House and Senate leaders.
   ``Concern is mounting that the government's ability to acquire
and retain good people is diminishing,'' the GAO said. ``You get
what you pay for. Unfortunately, the federal government's pay
structure has broken down.''
   The investigative agency of Congress also said the war on drugs
needs stronger leadership and that higher ethical standards must be
applied to top government officials.
   ``After years of `fed-bashing,' the new president needs to change
course,'' the GAO said. ``Theodore Roosevelt talked of using the
presidency as a `bully pulpit.' Today, this kind of leadership is
needed to invigorate the public service.''
   The report cited a 1987 governmentwide survey which found that
``many federal managers reported lower motivation levels.'' Morale
is so bad, it said, that ``only 13 percent of senior executives said
they would advise people beginning their careers to enter public
service.''
   ``If the quality of the federal work force is reduced, the
quality of government services and programs is reduced,'' the report
said.
   ``The bottom line in this situation is not less profit but, more
importantly, less effective government services _ services that
touch the lives of literally millions of people,'' it said.
   The GAO said Bush's political appointees ``must adhere to high
ethical standards and make ethics in government a priority in their
agencies.''
   The agency said a ``minuscule'' total of more than 500 federal
workers at all levels was convicted of job-related criminal
violations in 1987.
   ``But numbers are misleading,'' it said. ``When such offenses
occur, especially among higher level officials, respect for and

   The surroundings at Lansdowne Road might have been more used to
scrums and lineouts. But the trappings of football, American style,

the Eagles of Boston College gave the more than 44,000 fans a game

   As the Eagles took the field, Kamphaus knew that he could help
his longtime friend Waddle maintain that streak. And Waddle knew
that his friendship had helped bring Kamphaus back to action just
six weeks after suffering a broken jaw in a loss to Texas Christian.
   ``It's been going this way for 13 or 14 years,'' Waddle said

   Imagine sacrificing your children's education
to pay back a loan. You would begin to get an idea of the burden the
foreign debt places on countries like Mexico, economists say.
   Hamstrung by foreign debt payment demands, Mexico's rate of
growth has been practically zero the past six years, and the economy
actually will shrink 1 percent this year.
   ``This is the most urgent problem that President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari will face,'' said a Salinas adviser, 14 days before the
new president begins a six-year term.
   Those close to Salinas say privately he will be emphatic in his
demand to improve debt servicing terms and possibly reduce the
principal of Mexico's $102 billion debt. Salinas' goal, according to
a document prepared by advisers for his first months in office, ``is
to get Mexico to grow at an annual rate of 5 percent.''
   Salinas and his advisers maintain debt restructuring is a
necessity if Mexico is to resume economic growth.
   The first person to hear Salinas' arguments for restructuring
will be President-elect George Bush, whom Salinas will meet Tuesday
in Houston. It is an indication of Salinas' concern that he is
bringing his top economic advisers to the meeting.
   Mexican officials feel that Bush and his top aides, including
incoming Secretary of State James Baker and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, ``are men who know the problem of the foreign debt
well and have an open mind,'' in the words of one Salinas aide.
   Interest and principal payments on the foreign debt long have
been an economic problem. But in Mexico, suffering through its sixth
year of financial crisis, the payments also have become a political
problem, with a growing opposition demanding the government declare
a moratorium on interest payments.
   In 1988, Mexico paid $9 billion in interest on the debt and close
to $6 billion toward principal on the combined public and private
debt.
   At the same time, the government enacted belt-tightening measures
and a wage freeze in an attempt to fight inflation.
   Despite recriminations over the debt crisis and intermittent
debtor calls for a moratorium on interest payments, Mexico
consistently has maintained it intends to fulfill its foreign
obligations. But it is demanding a restructuring of payback terms
and a more cooperative attitude from creditor nations and banks.
   ``You could stop payments on the debt today if you wanted to,'' a
Salinas adviser said. ``But what are you going to do for the
financing of your needs tomorrow? Negotiation is better than
confrontation.''
   Mexican economists say the government's problem is how to
compensate debt payments abroad by increasing Mexico's income
through exports, loans and investment.
   Members of Salinas' economic team say Mexico has no intention to
default on payments. But one official warns Mexico also must ``grow
again in order to survive.''
   ``Growth is a political and economic imperative,'' said a member
of Salinas' advisory group.
   ``We do not want a trench war with the international community,''
Jose Angel Gurria, a top foreign debt negotiator in the Finance
Ministry, told an industrial meeting last week. But, he added,
``creditors must understand that we must grow....We get the
financing or we take it.''
   Mexico's income from exports of oil, and, increasingly,
manufacturing, combined with tourism and loans from international
organizations, has helped the country keep up with debt payments.
But this has meant sacrificing desperately needed development
projects and infrastructural investment.
   Mexican officials' ideal is a reduction of interest on the debt
or a simple elimination of part of the principal. But U.S. banks are
more reluctant than European banks to accept write-offs or interest
rate reductions.
   Mexican officials feel that if they can persuade the banks to
accept renegotiations, write-offs or exchanges of debt for bonds,
``we will be able to compensate for some of the cash sent abroad,''
an aide said.

<HEAD>Walesa Says No Agreement On Talks, But More Meetings Expected</HEAD>

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Saturday
that two days of meetings with government officials failed to
produce agreement on future talks between Communist authorities and
opposition representatives.
   Walesa met Friday and Saturday with Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak as part of an effort to set up large-scale talks on
Poland's future, including possible recognition of the Solidarity
trade union federation.
   The two sides agreed to continue contacts with the goal of
bringing their positions closer together, the state-run news agency
PAP announced in a dispatch about the same Walesa made his comments.
   The dispatch was the first government statement on the meetings,
which had been wrapped in secrecy.
   ``We haven't come that much closer. ... We hope for political
decisions because there are none at the moment,'' Walesa told
reporters at Warsaw Central Station before boarding a train back to
Gdansk.
   The Solidarity leader said he was worn out after the meetings
with Kiszczak, the first contacts between Walesa and Kiszczak since
Sept. 16.
   Walesa refused to say where the meetings were held. He said
Archbishop Bronislaw Dabrowksi served as host.
   Others at the meeting were Gdansk Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski; the
Rev. Alojzy Orszulik, a church press spokesman; Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
one of Walesa's closest lay advisers; and alternate Politburo member
Stanislaw Ciosek.
   The two meetings took place in an atmosphere of extreme secrecy,
with Walesa on Friday slipping away from Episcopate headquarters in
Warsaw, avoiding reporters waiting at various exits.
   Government, church, and Solidarity spokesmen refused repeated
requests to confirm the meetings were taking place.
   Kiszczak three weeks ago asked Walesa for a face-to-face meeting
to remove obstacles to long-promised talks with the opposition. He
sent another message to Walesa a week ago, but neither side has made
public the contents.
   The so-called ``round-table'' talks were promised by the
government after Walesa persuaded workers to end a nationwide strike
wave in August. The strikers' main demand was legalization of the
Solidarity trade union federation, which was outlawed in 1982.
   Walesa conferred Friday with advisers and officials of the Roman
Catholic Church before the first meeting with Kiszczak.
   Historian Bronislaw Geremek, a Walesa adviser who met with the
union chief, said the only ``decisive'' issue still blocking future
talks was whether the government would show a ``will to legalize
Solidarity.'' If the government would make a positive sign, he said,
``then it seems the chance for the round-table will return.''

   The change involves just a few words in the law
and would affect a half-dozen people a year.
   But indications that Israel is about to change its Law of Return
to deny automatic citizenship to non-Orthodox converts have
generated enormous controversy among American Jews, most of whom are
Reform or Conservative.
   At issue, they say, is whether these branches of Judaism are
perceived as legitimate. At risk, they say, is the unified support
of American Jewry that has sustained Israel through four wars and
scores of crises.
   American Jewish efforts on behalf of Israel ``are going to be
subordinated to the effort to get this changed. Israel is going to
be the object of a crusade in which they're going to be the bad
guys, not the good guys,'' said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, executive
director of the Association of Reform Zionists of America.
   Twenty-seven organizations _ among them the American Jewish
Congress, the American Jewish Committee, B'nai B'rith, Hadassah and
all major Reform and Conservative governing bodies _ issued a
statement Nov. 12 warning of the ``enormous damage, actual and
symbolic'' to Jews living outside of Israel.
   The vast majority of Jews worldwide are non-Orthodox, even in
Israel.
   The Council of Jewish Federations, which will raise an estimated
$850 million this year for Jewish needs around the world, said it
would dispatch a delegation to Israel to lobby against the change.
   ``We are dealing with the perceived disenfranchisement of
millions of American Jews who will feel they have been written
out,'' said Shoshana S. Cardin, past president of the council.
   Under Israeli law as it stands, all Jews _ defined as the
children of a Jewish woman, or converts _ are automatically accepted
as Israeli citizens.
   For decades, ultra-Orthodox elements in Israel have sought to
change the law so that only those who are converted ``in accordance
with Halacha'' _ the strict, Orthodox interpretation of Jewish law _
are eligible.
   Support for the Orthodox religious parties doubled in this year's
parliamentary elections. Though that amounted to only 18 seats in
the 120-seat Knesset, it gave the religious parties enough votes to
give either the Labor or Likud blocs the majority needed to form the
next government.
   Last week it was reported that the religious parties had agreed
to support Likud and had won numerous concessions, including a
promise to seek a change in the Law of Return.
   Unless Labor and Likud agree to form another unity government,
American Jewish leaders fear, the change is inevitable. It has been
reported that Likud would make a parliamentary vote in favor of the
change mandatory for party members.
   Converts such as Brenda Brooks of Hackensack, N.J., recoil at
this ``slap in the face. ... To hear I might not be considered a Jew
when I spent years trying to reach that goal really hurts, and I
find it really offensive.''
   But Brooks has no plans to move to Israel, underscoring the
issue's symbolic nature. It is believed that only five or six
non-Orthodox converts apply for Israeli citizenship each year.
   ``It is the equivalent of the Pledge of Allegiance issue'' in the
American presidential election, said Rabbi Irving Greenberg,
president of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership.
   ``It sets Jew against Jew ... symbolically conveying that the
vast majority of Jews aren't Jewish,'' said Michael Lerner, an
Orthodox Zionist who is editor of the liberal journal Tikkun.
   Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, executive director of the Conservative
Rabbinical Assembly, predicted many Jews will ``not back Israel with
the same devotion that they had in the past'' if the law passes.
   Marty Stein, chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, said he would
expect some drop in contributions to Israel, ``but I would hope it
would be very small.'' His group sends $300 million to Israel each
year.
   Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, chief spokesman for the ultra-Orthodox
Lubavitcher sect, argued that Orthodox conversions are the only ones
that are universally accepted as valid. He drew an analogy to a
dinner of Jewish friends _ if the food is kosher, both the observant
and non-observant can eat.
   The Lubavitcher Hasidim have been active in pressing for the
change, plunging into Israeli politics. Though Krinsky said he fears
other Jews would reduce their support for Israel, ``it would be
cutting your nose to spite your face.''

<TEXT>
   If George Bush turns his family
estate on a sea-walled Maine peninsula into the next summer White
House, he will follow a 200-year-old tradition dating back to the
nation's first president.
   Since the days of George Washington, U.S. presidents _ complete
with staffs and sometimes with considerable baggage _ have escaped
the pressures of the presidency and the oppressive heat of a
Washington summer with respites in the countryside, seashore or
mountains.
   ``Advisers always stress that the president get out of the White
House and (away from) the kind of craziness that exists there,''
says Marvin Druker, a political scientist at the University of
Southern Maine in Portland.
   ``They've always been criticized for being out of Washington for
extended periods of time,'' Druker continued, but such trips give
the president a break from the pressures of the job and a chance to
gain a new perspective on problem-solving.
   If tradition is followed, Bush's nine-bedroom family home in this
Maine resort town, population 4,500, is the most likely choice as
the next summer White House. And townsfolk, although changrined
about the potential for traffic jams and disruptions, are eagerly
awaiting the president-elect's arrival. Some speculate he may visit
as soon as Thanksgiving.
   Often such retreats have been presidents' private homes: John F.
Kennedy used his family's compound in Hyannisport, Mass., Lyndon B.
Johnson his sprawling ranch in Johnson City, Texas, and Jimmy Carter
his home in Plains, Ga.
   But Benjamin Harrison found his calm in a 100-room hotel in Cape
May, N.J.
   Most recently, President and Mrs. Reagan have turned on many
weekends to Camp David, the official presidential retreat 70 miles
from Washington in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland. There the
Reagans have watched old movies and held sing-a-longs of Hollywood
show tunes. Longer vacations have been held at the Reagan's mountain
ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he was known to relax riding
horseback, even clearing brush.
   Richard Nixon found solace and sunshine in San Clemente, Calif.,
and Key Biscayne, Fla., but Gerald Ford preferred a ski resort in
Vail, Colo., during his term in office.
   The practice of going home for vacations began with the nation's
first president.
   George Washington traveled to his Mount Vernon estate from
Philadelphia _ where the capital was then located _ twice a year
during his eight years in office, according to Ann Rauscher, a
spokeswoman for the Mount Vernon Ladies Association, which maintains
the suburban Washington, D.C., home as a museum.
   Thomas Jefferson traveled to Monticello in Charlottesville, Va.,
whenever he could during his four-year term, receiving visitors and
writing a mountain of letters _ 55,000 of which have survived.
   Jefferson ``was a workaholic, wherever he was. So it was a change
of pace, but it was not the kind of R & R we would associate with
many presidential vacations in the modern time,'' Daniel P. Jordan,
director of Monticello, said of Jefferson's trips home.
   Other presidents have been known to work much less while on
vacation.
   In l927, Calvin Coolidge spent from June to September at the
state game lodge in South Dakota's Custer State Park. There,
according to lodge manager David Shetler, Coolidge did nothing to
dispell his reputation as ``the most skilled president at doing
nothing.''
   At the end of his stay Coolidge announced to reporters that he
had decided against running for re-election in l928.
   Many presidents brought paperwork with them when leaving town, or
met with world leaders at their hideways.
   In 1929, Herbert Hoover discussed the Naval Limitation
Disarmament Treaty with British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald at
his summer White House at Camp Rapidan, a 164-acre camp in the Blue
Ridge Mountains of Virginia. The treaty was later signed and adopted
as a step toward world peace.
   Hoover donated the camp to the Shenandoah National Park to be
used as a weekend and summer retreat for future presidents.
   But it was a mountain camp 70 miles from Washington that became
the official weekend home for presidents in 1942.
   That year Franklin D. Roosevelt had Camp David built in a heavily
wooded area of Catoctin Mountain in Maryland _ where the elevation
kept the camp cool and its isolated high location provided adequate
security. He called it Shangri-La, from the perfect mountain kingdom
in ``Lost Horizon.''
   A number of historic meetings have been held there, including
Roosevelt's 1943 visit with Great Britain's Prime Minister Winston
Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower's conference with Soviet Premier
Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1959.
   And, in 1978, President Carter hosted peace talks between
President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin
of Israel that resulted in a major agreement, the Camp David Accords.

   George Bush will be looking to deliver on his
``kinder and gentler nation'' theme when he moves into the White
House, but economic pressures could force him to put some campaign
promises on the back burner.
   The stock market retreat and the dollar's fall in value since the
Nov. 8 election both testify to the concerns the financial world has
about the president-elect's ability to bring down the $155 billion
annual deficit, especially given his promise not to raise taxes.
   Bush has already decided to keep friend and adviser Nicholas F.
Brady on as secretary of the Treasury, and he told reporters at
week's end that he was concentrating next on filling out the rest of
his economic team.
   By all accounts, the director of the Office of Management and
Budget is almost certain to be Richard Darman, the former assistant
Treasury secretary and right-hand aide to James A. Baker III who has
wide knowledge of the inner workings of the executive branch.
   Although Bush was often accused of running an issueless race for
the presidency, he actually made enough speeches and produced enough
position papers to fill a 347-page book published by the Republican
National Committee in the closing weeks of the campaign.
   While some critics said Bush's ``flexible freeze'' plan to
balance the budget within four years was weak on specifics and built
around rosy economic assumptions, Bush did flesh out a raft of other
promises, from a toddler tax credit costing nearly $2 billion to
doubling the federal budget for prison construction.
   Bush will get an early chance to elaborate on those promises soon
after he takes office on Jan. 20, when he will be called upon to
revise the Reagan administration's fiscal 1990 budget.
   ``Given these nervous Nellies in the world financial markets, I'm
sure the new president will want to turn his attention to some of
these economic issues,'' said Gary Bauer, the former Reagan White
House domestic policy adviser and now president of the Family
Research Council.
   But Bauer predicted that Bush will quickly make his mark felt on
such issues as abortion, parental leave and day care, both through
judicial appointments and by ``framing better alternatives'' to
liberal legislative approaches to social problems.
   Bush opposed a Democratic bill in the 100th Congress that would
have forced employers to provide unpaid leaves to parents of
newborns and sick children. He also offered his $1,000 toddler tax
credit plan as an alternative to a $2.5 billion Democratic plan to
expand federal regulation and support for day care centers.
   Bush, in two of his first speeches last week told literacy
advocates and the National Geographic Society that he intends to
deliver on his promises of being an ``education president'' and a
strong environmentalist.
   Congress has already acted to help him keep some of those
promises by enacting a ban on ocean dumping by 1991 and by allowing
parents to earn tax-free interest on U.S. savings bonds for college
starting in 1990.
   He is certain to have a tough time convincing Democrats in
Congress of the merits of his plan to cut the capital gains tax rate
to 15 percent from 28 percent or 33 percent. Bush has said his as
yet unnamed defense secretary will have some tough decisions to
make, including choosing between the mobile MX and the Midgetman
missiles.
   Bush also is committed to sitting down with the nation's
governors to to discuss the continuing troubles of America's schools.
   He has promised to spend more on the $1.8 billion Head Start
program for disadvantaged pre-school children, and to create a new
$500 million program to reward schools that get good results with
poor children.
   He is pledged to spend at least several hundred million dollars
to expand Medicaid coverage for poor mothers and children.
   Bush has promised to convene a global conference on the
environment within his first year.
   Without making any specific dollar commitments, he has said the
time for study of the acid rain problem is past. He has promised to
send Congress legislation ``to cut millions of tons of sulfur
dioxide emissions by the year 2000, and to significantly reduce
nitrogen oxide emissions as well.''

   Rejecting both the Bush and Dukakis plans as
unworkable, the General Accounting Office said Saturday that tax
increases and cuts in defense and Social Security must be considered
to slash a federal budget deficit that threatens the nation's
economic future.
   ``Additional revenues are probably an unavoidable part of any
realistic strategy for reducing the deficit,'' the congressional
watchdog agency said in reports to President-elect George Bush and
leaders of the House and Senate.
   Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, director of the GAO, said
a workable solution can be developed only through close cooperation
between Congress and the new president, with Bush personally
involved in the negotiations.
   The GAO, which uses hundreds of experts in every field to oversee
the federal bureaucracy on behalf of Congress, made no
recommendations on which taxes should be raised or which programs
should be cut.
   However, the report cited estimates that $30 billion could be
raised annually with slight increases in personal income tax rates,
and that a 5 percent national sales tax on most commodities except
food, housing and medical care would yield $67 billion a year.
   ``All participants must consider all parts of the budget to be
negotiable, including defense, entitlements (such as Social Security
and Medicare) and revenues,'' the agency said.
   ``The budget problem must be solved for the new administration to
have any flexibility to pursue its own policy agenda, for the
economy to regain its vigor and for the American people to enjoy a
long-term standard of living comparable to the rest of the developed
world,'' Bowsher wrote.
   But the GAO said it saw no ``quick or painless solutions'' to the
deficit, which stood at $150 billion in the budget year that ended
Sept. 30. It specifically rejected four approaches that have been
proposed:
   _``We cannot `grow' our way out of the problem,'' an approach
favored by some in the Reagan administration and reiterated this
week in a report by the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``Public
demand for government services _ to solve problems ranging from drug
abuse, AIDS, education and homelessness to drought and forest fires
_ grow as fast as revenues,'' said the GAO.
   _``We cannot `freeze' our way out of the problem.'' During his
presidential campaign, Bush repeatedly rejected higher taxes and
advocated a ``flexible freeze'' on spending. The GAO noted that the
great bulk of the budget is in politically sensitive areas such as
Social Security, farm price supports and defense, or in fixed
interest costs.
   _``We cannot reach out and effortlessly gather in some magic pool
of uncollected revenues.'' Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis proposed raising revenues by collecting the $86 billion or
more in unpaid tax liabilities annually. The GAO said administrative
costs would be high, and it would require several years to train new
Internal Revenue Service agents for the job.
   _``We cannot `sequester' our way out of the problem through
mechanistic, formula-based program cuts of the sort prescribed in
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings ... legislation.'' That law is aimed at
balancing the budget, but the GAO noted that as much as 80 percent
of the budget is exempt from the law's mandated cuts.
   Although the deficit has dropped from the record levels reached
earlier in the Reagan administration, the problem is actually worse
_ not better _ than it appears, the GAO said.
   For example, it said, the real deficit in the government's
general fund is not $155 billion but $252 billion. A $97 billion
surplus in Social Security funds makes the general deficit look
smaller.
   Even worse, GAO stated, ``there is an explosion of unfunded costs
waiting to greet the new adminstration.''
   Among the biggest is the crisis in the nation's savings and loan
industry, which the GAO estimates will cost $50 billion to fix, much
of it financed by tax funds.
   It also listed a cleanup and modernization of nuclear weapons
plants costing $130 billion, and said the Defense Department's
five-year plan calls for at least $200 billion more than is likely
to be available.
   The GAO also said President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
will cost at least $69 billion in its first phase; another $80
billion-plus will be needed for long-run modernization of computer
and communications systems, $25 billion for the air traffic control
system and $28 billion for construction of a space station.
   Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation issued its own recommendations
for wiping out the deficit. It recommended holding the rate of
spending growth to less than 4 percent a year and said the deficit
would be eliminated in 1993. The private group said a tax increase
would threaten economic growth which has produced the revenue that
already has reduced the deficit.

   With George Bush's victory still ringing
in their ears, Democratic politicians already are taking their first
delicate steps in Iowa, which state party leaders hope will remain
the leadoff event for the 1992 presidential race.
   So it came as no suprise to David Ostendorf when the phone in his
cramped upstairs office at the rural advocacy headquarters of
Prairiefire rang with the news that, of course, Jesse Jackson would
be delighted to offer ``a fresh perspective'' on the election just
past.
   Meanwhile state employee and party activist Paulee Lipsman
lunched with Delaware Sen. Joe Biden and got a handwritten note a
few days later. ``He wasn't closing any doors,'' she said.
   Democrats face months of arguing over how they lost the 1988
election, and Iowa activists are resigned to being assigned at least
some of the blame because that's where the whole thing started last
Feb. 8.
   ``My sense is most Iowa Democrats expect there will be a debate
about the Iowa caucuses,'' said Bonnie Campbell, state Democratic
chairwoman. ``They are defensive because they like what we do.''
   Top Democratic leaders are beginning to debate the role of the
Iowa caucuses in the next presidential election, and any resolution
is months away. But in the past month a roster of failed Democratic
candidates has paraded through the state in the past month, and
candidates, after all, are what an election is all about.
   ``The problem with changing the process is it's something we talk
about every four years, it's like leap year,'' said Phil Roeder, a
former Democratic Party spokesman who now is political director for
Sen. Tom Harkin.
   ``The problem is, the upcoming four-year cycle of a campaign
starts at the exact moment when the previous one ends. That leaves
virtually no time for serious reflection,'' he said.
   In gambling, the term is hedging a bet. In politics, it's called
going to Iowa, just in case.
   Jackson stumped the state, and agreed to speak this weekend at a
convention of farm activists, just the sort of liberal farmers who
backed him this year.
   ``That was clearly where he started,'' Ostendorf said. ``He sees
farm and rural people in general as being critical to future
election work, his own or anybody else's.
   ``I think clearly he's coming here to make sure his base here and
his roots here are kept solid,'' he said.
   With Bush's inauguration still weeks away, campaigning to replace
him is a topic no one wants to discuss. It's a delicate mating dance
where less is spoken than simply understood.
   Candidates are merely responding to invitations to share their
views and renew acquaintances, while perhaps making a few new ones.
   ``You come in and touch base with those people,'' said Ted
Anderson, a lobbyist for the union representing state workers.
``Evidently he's interested, so why not?''
   It's also shaping up as a strictly Democratic show, with
Republicans content to sit on the sidelines.
   Democratic leaders are making the case that Iowa wasn't
responsible for Michael Dukakis' loss and point out that the state
voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1988, the first
time in 24 years.
   But the Iowa caucuses failed to pick the eventual winner of the
Democratic and Republican presidential nominations in 1988. Both
Dukakis and Bush came in third there.
   Critics of the Iowa caucuses have said that the state is too
small and its population too unrepresentative for the results to
merit the time and and national attention they receive.
   Ms. Campbell said it will take more than Iowa-bashing to end the
state's role.
   ``Everybody just assumes there are states out there just dying to
be first and that may not be the case,'' she said. ``Nobody has
really offered a concrete alternative. It may well be that nothing
happens. I think if we survive that will be why.''
   Others take a more pragmatic view, arguing that the state is
almost certain to be forced to share some of its luster by the
clamor for change.
   ``I don't see Iowa going quietly off into the sunset,'' Roeder
said. ``I think we're still going to be first, but I think there's a
chance some other important states will move up.''
   But as activists argue, and party officials debate about a time
``window'' for early primaries, the candidates will settle the
question.
   ``We can hold our caucuses irrespective of the window, but it
will be a question of whether the candidates come here,'' Ms.
Campbell said. ``And we don't know that.''
   ``We've seen some people who obviously have some thoughts about
1992,'' Roeder said. ``I think they're all, when it comes right down
to it, smart politicians and they would say they're not going to
close any doors to any opportunities.''

   The United States outpaced other major nations
in improving the energy efficiency of its industries from 1970 to
1986 but still lags behind most other industrial countries, an
environmental research group said Saturday.
   The World Resources Institute said the United States gained 33
percent in energy used per dollar of gross national product, the
total retail value of all goods and services produced by the
economy, in those 16 years.
   Japan ranked second with a 32 percent gain. Gains of some other
countries included Canada and France, 28 percent; West Germany, 23
percent; Britain, 19 percent; Italy, 15 percent, and Brazil, 6
percent.
   The International Energy Agency recently ranked the United States
in eighth place among 20 countries in gains in efficiency of energy
use by industry from 1973 to 1985.
   Pushed by the two oil shocks of the 1970s and rapidly rising
prices that continued through the early 1980s, most developed
nations managed to use less energy to turn out goods and services by
the mid-1980s.
   According to figures compiled by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, U.S. energy efficiency improved at about 1.1 percent
per year in the 1970s, accelerated to 2.8 percent per year from 1980
to 1986 and remained essentially unchanged in 1986-87.
   An 0.6 percent gain is expected this year.
   Here is the energy use per dollar of gross national product,
expressed in terms Btus per dollars of 1980 buying power for each
country: (A Btu or British thermal unit is a standard energy unit.
About 300 Btus are used in boiling a quart of water.)
   United States, 19,585; France, 8,264; Japan, 9,285; Italy,
10,714; Germany, 10,714; Brazil, 10,775; Britain, 13,829; Canada,
23,177.
   For comparison, here are 1986 figures for some other countries:
China, 41,128; India, 27,815; Poland, 83,646; Hungary, 47,062.

   Volunteers searched through ashes and
rubble Saturday searching for 25 children missing after fire swept
through a shantytown on the edge of the capital, police said.
   Ten people were injured in the fire late Friday night at the
makeshift camp in the Mirpur area, police said.
   They said about 1,000 huts were destroyed before firemen brought
the blaze under control at 1 a.m., two hours after it was reported.
The fire apparently started with an electrical short circuit in a
quilt shop, police said.
   The shantytown houses about 20,000 people. The residents speak
Urdu, rather than Bangladesh's dominant Bengali language, and call
themselves ``stranded Pakistanis.''
   There are about 250,000 such people in Bangladesh, living in
about 70 camps. They were caught up in the 1971 Pakistani war in
which East Pakistan won its independence and became the new nation
of Bangladesh.
   The old West Pakistan is now called Pakistan and is separated
from Bangladesh by India.
   About 250,000 Urdu-speakers already have been transferred from
Bangladesh to Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   Violence by right-wing death squads, drug
traffickers and leftist guerrillas is practically out of control in
Colombia, undermining confidence in President Virgilio Barco's
government.
   While Colombians largely blame Barco for the worst violence since
a war between the Liberal and Conservative parties left at least
200,000 dead in the early 1950s, it clearly results from the
cautious approach to social reform by the white minority of about 25
percent that rules this country of 30 million.
   Leftist guerrillas pose the most serious threat and demonstrate
most clearly the growing discontent in the lower classes. Fifteen
years ago, the guerrillas scarcely had 1,000 poorly equipped
combatants. Today they number an estimated 10,000.
   The rebels are believed to have thousands of peasant sympathizers
who aid them. They also have mortars, anti-tank rockets,
shoulder-fired ground-to-air missiles, machine guns and other
lightweight modern weapons.
   Police reported 489 kidnappings in the last year, 51 percent of
them by leftist guerrillas. Guerrillas this year have attacked 49
towns, blown up oil and gas pipelines 56 times, ambushed two dozen
army patrols and destroyed bridges, electricity towers and other
public works.
   In addition:
   _Right-wing death squads have killed 249 people in 20 massacres
this year.
   _Drug traffickers have killed 26 judges, a justice minister, an
attorney general, two newspaper editors and scores of other people
in the last four years.
   _About 150 members of the country's two rival cocaine families
have been killed this year in a war over control of cocaine
distribution in New York City.
   The rapid growth of the guerrilla movement indicates the lower
class, especially peasants in rural areas, feel there is no
alternative for bettering their lives.
   Still, no one influential in Colombian politics seems to go along
with arguments that much of the violence results from Colombia's
white minority refusing to change the political and economic
structure that keeps Indians and blacks at the bottom.
   _The minimum wage has stood at the equivalent of about $90 a
month for the past two decades. It is not enough for many to afford
education, medical care and basic foods such as eggs, milk, bread
and meat. It is not uncommon for some families to have one meal a
day of soup made with something like turnip greens.
   _There is no room in public schools for tens of thousands of
children, and many poor families do not have the money for books,
materials and uniforms to send their children to school even if
there is room. The wealthy and the middle classes send their
children to private schools.
   _In the last land ownership survey in 1970, the government found
that 4.3 percent of the people owned 68 percent of the land and that
10 percent of the farmers held 80 percent of the land.
   The government of former President Belisario Betancur government
allowed leftist guerrillas to organize a party, the Patriotic Union,
in 1984. But right-wing death squads have killed more than 600
members of the party, including its president.
   Neither Barco nor Betancur, who first proposed peace talks with
guerrillas in 1982, made a serious attempt to wipe out the death
squads.
   On Nov. 11 a death squad in three vehicles rode through the town
of Segovia in northern Colombia for almost an hour, firing
submachine guns and throwing hand grenades. Forty-three people were
killed and more than 30 were wounded.
   Two months ago, Barco offered to pardon all guerrillas who
surrendered and proposed peace talks. However, the plan lacked any
new approach to Colombia's problems and the government said it would
not negotiate changes in the country's political, economic and
social structure.
   The country's six guerrilla groups rejected the offer, calling it
an ultimatum to surrender, and launched an unprecedented wave of
attacks.
   Barco's government has not abandoned hopes for peace talks and
has restrained the army from taking the offensive against the
guerrillas.
   The army has been held back since Betancur first offered peace
talks. A cease-fire negotiated by the Betancur government collapsed,
and Betancur fired a defense minister who refused to accept the
peace initiative.
   The army's disagreement with a negotiated settlement surfaced
again this month when the country's top general, Defense Minister
Rafael Samudio, called for all-out war on the guerrillas.
   Barco fired him within 24 hours.
   A former Liberal Party president, Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, said
last month the 170,000-man military must be increased by 50 percent
to meet the guerrilla threat.
   The country's most influential newspaper, El Tiempo, a Bogota
daily that traditionally supports the Liberal Party, has criticized
Barco's peace initiatives and called for doubling the size of the
army.
   With the government's refusal to negotiate substantial social
changes and with the army gaining support for a military solution,
it appears inevitable Colombia is headed for even more violence.

   A British jet with 320 people on board became

but there were no injuries, officials said.
   Another aircraft was diverted while the Dan-Air Airbus, which had
flown from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, was towed away, said
Gatwick spokeswoman Carol Hill.
   She said the jet turned off the main runway to taxi into the
airport when one of its wheel sections went off the pavement.
   Passengers were taken by bus into the terminal from the plane,
she said.
   Peter Clegg, a spokesman for Dan-Air, said it was not known why
the aircraft went off the taxiway, but said ``it was going slowly.
It didn't skid.''

<HEAD>Human Jawbone 2 Million Years Old, Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human jawbone unearthed in central China has
been found to date back 2 million years, making it the oldest human
fossil discovered in China, an archaeologist said Saturday.
   The jawbone with several teeth was discovered in 1986 near the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan province, but dating
tests were completed only recently.
   The official People's Daily published the conclusion Saturday in
a front-page report and said it reinforced still inconclusive
arguments that man originated in Asia, not Africa.
   Ji Hongxiang, an archaelogist at the Academy of Social Sciences
and member of the team that excavated the site, said in a telephone
interview that experts believed the man to whom the jawbone belonged
was able to use fire and simple tools.
   The bone was found buried along with numerous bones of monkeys
and other mammals, Ji said.
   The oldest human remains previously found in China were teeth
found in Yuanmu County in southern China's Yunnan province in 1965.
They were determined to be 1.7 million years old.
   Archaeologists found more teeth last year in Yuanmu on Butterfly
Ridge and announced they were 2.5 million to 4 million years old and
were human. However, other Chinese experts said the teeth came from
an ape.
   China's most famous human fossils are the Peking Man bones,
discovered near Beijing in 1929 and lost during World War II. In the
1930s, the bones were dated as 500,000 years old, but some experts
believe the more advanced tests used now might prove them
considerably older.
   Fossil finds in eastern Africa indicate that the earliest kind of
primitive humans lived there about 2.5 million years ago.

   Swedish television cancelled a
controversial British film on the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, news reports said Saturday.
   ``The Men Who Killed President Kennedy,'' based on a book by
Steve Rivele, alleges the assassination was part of a major
conspiracy and names three Frenchmen as hired killers. The three
Frenchmen from Corsica have denied the charges and claimed alibis.
   The film was scheduled for broadcast Saturday, the eve of the
25th anniversary of Kennedy's death. But Ewonne Winblad, head of
Sweden's public television Channel 2 news department, told the
Stockholm daily Expressen she ``wanted to be more sure of the
information put forward in the film before airing it.''
   Expressen said Ms. Winblad had second thoughts after the film was
criticized in a recent debate on British television.
   Kenendy was assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.

^Environmental Refugees May Soon Outnumber Those Displaced by War,</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ There are more than 10
million refugees who have been forced to flee their homes because of
environmental disasters or degraded lands and their number may soon
exceed those displaced by war or rebellion, an environmental
research group said Saturday.
   ``Because migration is a last resort _ when conditions become so
poor that life itself is in imminent danger _ the rising number of
environmental refugees should be seen as an important indicator of
the extent and severity of worldwide environmental deterioration,''
said the Worldwatch Institute in a report.
   Worldwatch's figures count people displaced as a result of
long-term environmental changes such as the encroachment of deserts
on pastureland in Africa as well as sudden disasters such as the
recent flooding in Bangladesh.
   It estimated that there are about 10 million refugees as a result
of such environmental changes, compared to about 13 million who have
been displaced by wars or rebellions.
   Land degradation takes many forms and may involve erosion,
waterlogging or excessive salt buildup from poor irrigation.
   According to some estimates, as many as 20 million acres of
agricultural land is destroyed each year by either a shortage of
water, causing desertification, or too much water, causing land to
become waterlogged.
   Meanwhile, another report suggested that while the effort will be
expensive much of this land in developing countries could be
restored with the proper techniques and incentives.
   ``Rehabilitating and restoring degraded lands is at least as much
a social, economic and political problem as an ecological one,''
said the report by the World Resources Institute. It cited as
examples land rehabilitation programs in Egypt, India and China
   The report gave no cost estimate for such rehabilitation, but
noted that 10 forestry and watershed rehabilitation projects
recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
would cost $1 billion.

<HEAD>Trade Pact Turns Campaign Into Debate Over Canada's Future</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the campaign for Monday's election started
seven weeks ago, no one predicted it would become a debate over
Canada's future, its national identity and perhaps its very soul.
   But the question of whether to proceed with the free trade
agreement that would eliminate trade barriers between the United
States and Canada quickly overshadowed other issues and electrified
the race.
   Instead of the prevailing view that Canadian identity was
insecure and fragile, each side found it had a lot to be proud of in
Canada, despite vastly different interpretations.
   The election will decide much more than the 295 seats in the
House of Commons.
   It also will determine if the trade agreement goes into effect
Jan. 1 as scheduled, and it may set a new vision of Canada as a
mature nation.
   Only a majority government for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Progressive Conservative Party assures enforcement of the pact
Mulroney signed with President Reagan on Jan. 2. The agreement has
been approved by the U.S. Congress and still needs Canadian
parliamentary approval to take effect.
   Mulroney says the agreement is crucial to future Canadian
prosperity by assuring access to the larger U.S. market.
   John Turner's Liberal Party and the socialist New Democratic
Party, headed by Ed Broadbent, oppose the deal. They say free trade
would reduce Canada to a junior partner of the United States, its
sovereignty restricted and its basic identity threatened.
   Polls indicate a close race between the Conservatives and the
Liberals, with the New Democrats trailing in third place. But a
victory for either opposition party, or a minority government, would
effectively block the agreement.
   Mulroney led the Conservatives to a landslide victory in 1984 in
the House of Commons. He appeared headed for another easy mandate
when he called the election Oct. 1 and dissolved Parliament.
   The Liberals, long a dominant force in Canadian politics, were
still recovering from their 1984 defeat and divided by internal
tensions over Turner's leadership.
   Broadbent was hoping his personal popularity could spark the New
Democrats to their best showing ever.
   Although opinion was divided on the free trade agreement, polls
initially showed strong support for the Conservatives, whose four
years in office were marked by general prosperity.
   But all that changed in a nationally televised debate between
Turner and Mulroney on Oct. 25.
   The silver-haired Liberal forcefully told Mulroney that the prime
minister had ``sold us out'' with an agreement that would turn
Canada into ``a pale replica of the United States.''
   ``You've been scaremongering,'' Mulroney responded, saying there
was ``not the slightest justification'' for such fears.
   But the debate made the trade issue the focus of the rest of the
campaign.
   Canada and the United States are each other's biggest trading
partners, with about $150 billion worth of goods crossing the border
_ the strongest trade partnership in the world.
   The agreement would phase out all tariffs between the two nations
over a 10-year period, creating a unified North American market
aimed at 245 million Americans and 26 million Canadians.
   Mulroney and other supporters of the agreement argue that it
won't affect Canadian traditions or sovereignty. They say that
without assured access to the U.S. market, Canada risks becoming an
isolated backwater of international trade.
   The prime minister calls the trade deal ``a visionary instrument
of job creation and new wealth, and it is clearly something that is
on the right side of history.''
   He says Canada is a mature and competent nation, able to compete
with the United States without resorting to the high tariffs of
19th-century protectionism.
   But Turner and his supporters say the pact will turn the nation
into a pool of natural resources for the United States and threaten
its social and health-care programs, which are heavily sponsored by
the government.
   The Liberal candidate says the pact threatens the sense of
community and fairness that characterizes Canada, unleashing free
market forces and unchecked competition.
   Referring to the privatized American system of health care, the
Liberal candidate told his supporters that ``when you walk into a
Canadian hospital, they don't check your credit card before they
check your pulse.''
   In the past weeks, a cottage industry of publications has sprung
up for and against almost every aspect of the agreement. In
addition, lobby groups have promoted extensive campaigns to support
or oppose the deal.
   Last-minute commercials from the Conservatives portray Turner as
an opportunist who jumped on the free trade issue to save his own
political future without regard to the country.
   Commercials sponsored by the Liberals show Mulroney saluting the
United States.
   Turner maintains that he is not anti-American or against free
trade but that the agreement is simply ``a bad deal.''

   The Progressive Conservative Party is back in the
lead and could win the parliamentary majority needed for the free
trade agreement with the United States to proceed, according to a
Gallup Poll published Saturday.
   The poll showed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservatives
with 40 percent, the Liberal Party led by John Turner with 35
percent and the socialist New Democratic Party led by Ed Broadbent
with 22 percent.
   It said such an outcome in Monday's election could translate into
162 seats for the Conservatives in the newly expanded, 295-seat
House of Commons, 14 more than needed for a majority.
   The poll published by the Toronto Star said the Liberals would
have 97 seats and the New Democrats 36.
   Both opposition parties oppose the agreement signed by Mulroney
and President Reagan in January. It still needs Canadian
parliamentary approval to take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled. It would
phase out all tariffs between Canada and the United States over a
10-year period.
   The Gallup Poll was based on 2,097 personal interviews and 1,970
telephone interviews between Monday and Thursday. It had a margin of
error of 3 percent.
   Another poll published Saturday, by Angus Reid of Winnipeg,
Manitoba, found similar results. It placed the Conservatives ahead
with 41 percent of decided voters, 33 percent for the Liberals and
23 percent for the New Democrats.
   Reid, one of the most widely published pollsters in Canada, said
it was inconclusive whether the popular vote would result in a
Conservative majority or minority government.
   A Gallup Poll published Monday found the Conservatives and
Liberals tied with 35 percent each and the New Democrats in third
with 26 percent.
   The last poll by the Environics Research Group firm published in
the Globe and Mail newspaper on Nov. 10 found 37 percent for the
Liberals, 35 percent for the Conservatives and 24 percent for the
New Democrats.

   Oprah Winfrey apparently provided the
inspiration some people needed when the 34-year-old talk show
hostess revealed how she shed 67 pounds.
   York Hospital, which offers the same Optifast weight loss program
Ms. Winfrey used, has received more than 100 calls about enrolling,
said Marta Smith, program director for the hospital's Nutrition and
Metabolic Center.
   ``She was so inspirational,'' Ms. Smith said. ``A lot of patients
said, `If she did it, I can do it.'''
   On Tuesday's show, Ms. Winfrey, wearing size 10 jeans, talked
about how she lost the weight with the liquid diet.
   Ms. Smith said more than 40 people had enrolled by mid-week in an
orientation program scheduled for later this month. It normally
draws 25 to 30 people.
   Only people at least 50 pounds overweight can participate, she
said.

   Marilyn Addams, wife of the late New Yorker
cartoonist Charles Addams, says that although her husband's drawings
were populated by ghosts and ghouls, he detested funerals and told
her he didn't want one.
   ``So a party it is,'' Mrs. Addams said Friday in explaining the
gathering of about 250 of his friends at the New York Public Library.
   Addams died Sept. 29 from a heart attack. He was 76 and had drawn
cartoons for the weekly magazine for 53 years.
   The 1960s TV show, ``The Addams Family,'' was inspired by his
macabre characters.
   At Friday's party, some of Addams' cartoons were on display,
including one of Morticia, the sexy vampire, asking to borrow a cup
of cyanide from a neighbor.
   Candles twinkled, food was served, a Dixieland band played and
people danced.
   Mrs. Addams wore white; she wore black when she married Addams

   Country singer Barbara Mandrell has moved
away from Barbara Mandrell Boulevard north of Nashville to a home in
the country.
   ``We are farmers now, this is the first time in my life to be a
real country girl,'' she said of the move to a six-bedroom log house
on 136 acres northwest of the city.
   Mandrell ties the move to her new album, ``I'll Be Your Jukebox
Tonight,'' a return to the country style of her youth.
   Most of her hits have been pop tunes. But the latest album has
two hillbilly oldies, including the 1961 Wynn Stewart classic, ``Big
Big Love.''
   ``In the 1960s when that record was popular I played steel guitar
for my father in his band,'' Mandrell said. ``It was one of the
songs that I did.''
   The tune marks the first time Mandrell, a musical prodigy as a
child, has played steel guitar on a studio album.
   She toured with Patsy Cline, Johnny Cash, George Jones and Don
Gibson at age 13.
   ``I'm 39 years old but I'm 28 years in this business. I grew up
in it; and that helped me to know and learn from Wynn Stewart and
Tex Ritter and Joe Maphis and a lot of people who aren't with us
anymore,'' she said.

   Former Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker Jr.,
who left retirement to be President Reagan's chief of staff during
the Iran-Contra scandal, was named Saturday to receive the 1989
Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award.
   It has been presented annually since 1973 by the Harry S. Truman
Good Neighbor Award Foundation to a person who exemplifies the
accomplishments and characteristics of the late Democratic president.
   Baker, 63, a Republican, served in the Senate from 1967 to 1985.
He was named White House chief of staff Feb. 27, 1987, following the
resignation of Donald Regan. Baker resigned from the post on June 14.
   Phil Pistilli, president of the foundation, called Baker ``a
distinguished statesman, highly regarded by all for his vital role
in helping the United States at a time when the nation was in a
crisis.
   ``His career is flawless, admired by all and, in our opinion,
being a Republican statesman, he reminds us a great deal of
President Truman, working in the Truman tradition.''
   The award will be presented at a luncheon celebrating what would
have been Truman's 105th birthday on May 8.

   Joy Hall, 11, enjoys talking in front of
television cameras and radio microphones _ when she isn't practicing
gymnastics, bowling or playing basketball.
   Those talents won the admiration of delegates to the National
Easter Seal Society convention in Dallas, who selected the Baltimore
youngster Thursday as National Easter Seal Child for 1989.
   Joy, who lacks control of her arm and leg muscles and wears leg
braces, was born with cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that
causes muscles to become weak, lethargic or spastic, said Rebecca
Levine, spokeswoman for the Easter Seal Society of Maryland.
   But Joy does not regard the handicap as an impediment to the
activities she loves.
   The sixth grader plays basketball at school, attends gymnastics
classes geared to build strength in children with physical
disabilities and loves to go bowling.
   Joy will make a series of appearances for Easter Seals, including
a trip to the White House in February, Ms. Levine said.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Alcoholic Veterans' Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation overriding
a Supreme Court decision that allowed the Veterans Administration to
deny benefits to veterans who were alcoholics because their conduct
was labeled ``willful misconduct,'' the White House said Saturday.
   Under the bill signed by Reagan on Friday, the disabling effects
of chronic alcoholism will not be considered to the result of
``willful misconduct,'' the White House said.
   Previously, veterans could obtain an extension of the 10-year
period for using their GI Bill educational benefits if they had been
prevented from using the benefits earlier by a physical or mental
disorder which did not stem from willful misconduct.
   The legislation results from a lawsuit filed by two veterans who
were recovering alcoholics who had sought an extension of the
benefit period. The VA rejected their request on the basis that
their condition was determined to be willful misconduct.
   In April, Supreme Court said in a 4-3 decision that the
government could disqualify the veterans's request for a benefits
extension. In denying the two men's request, it said, the VA did not
violate a federal law protecting the rights of the handicapped.
   The high court did not address the issue of whether alcoholism is
a disease, but said the VA was not compelled to regard it as such.
It also said those who believe there is a conflict should ask
Congress to change the law.
   Groups treating alcoholics have long dealt with it as a disease,
but critics fear that this approach removes individual
responsibility for such behavior as drunken driving and spouse and
child abuse.
   Reagan signed separate legislation Friday providing a 4.1 percent
cost-of-living increase in the compensation paid to nearly 2.2
million veterans with service-connected disabilities, and to about
323,000 surviving spouses and dependents of veterans who died of
service-related causes.
   The same measure establishes a new, seven-member U.S. Court of
Veterans Appeals based in Washington to review disputes over VA
benefits.

   A parliamentary committee on Saturday found
Estonia's bid for sovereignty at odds with the Soviet Constitution,
but activists in a nearby republic demanded their leaders approve
similar autonomy.
   In New Delhi, where he was on an official visit, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said some Estonians were acting too emotionally
but that the tense, formerly independent Baltic republics would
settle down.
   ``What is happening in Estonia is perestroika,'' Gorbachev said.
   A commission of the national Supreme Soviet ruled that an
amendment to the Estonian Constitution ran counter to the supreme
national law, according to the official Tass news agency.
   The amendment, passed Wednesday, requires any new Soviet law be
ratified by Estonia.
   Laws approved by the Estonian parliament ``contained a number of
provisions which run counter to the norms of the Constitution of the
U.S.S.R. on which the Soviet socialist federation is based,'' Tass
said.
   The commission's conclusion was submitted to the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, which summoned
Estonian leaders to a meeting in Moscow.
   The Supreme Soviet of another Baltic republic, Lithuania, was set
to debate similar legislation last week. But it was dropped without
a vote when the republic's Communist Party leader, Algirdas
Brazauskas, said it was unconstitutional.
   The streets of the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, were quiet, but
``there is huge dissatisfaction with the work of the session,'' said
Alvydas Medalinskas, a spokesman for the grass-roots Lithuanian
Movement for Perestroika.
   Scattered demonstrations were reported in Vilnius on Friday night
after the republic's Supreme Soviet adjourned.
   Medalinskas said in a telephone interview that the Movement was
seeking the signatures of the 350 members of the Lithuanian Supreme
Soviet on a letter declaring the session invalid because of ``gross
violations'' of parliamentary rules.
   ``Seventeen already have signed it. Five rejected it all
together,'' said Medalinskas in a telephone interview.
   If one-third, or 117 legislators, sign the letter, a new session
must be held, he said.
   Spokesmen for the Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika said
Brazauskas appeared on the republic's official television Saturday
night, defending results of the session and saying the legislators
could not go any further.
   In the 15-minute speech, he also said efforts to pressure
legislators into calling for a new session were impermissible, said
representatives of the Movement.
   In an apparent Kremlin effort to reassure the country's 15
constituent republics, the Council of Ministers met with their
representatives Friday on economic power-sharing, official Radio
Moscow said.
   The small, Westward-looking Baltic republics have used
Gorbachev's political reforms to push for greater economic and
cultural autonomy. Baltic residents also contend that proposed
amendments to the Soviet Constitution will limit their autonomy.
   In his comments in India, Gorbachev said, ``There is a lot of
debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure things will settle
down.''
   Soviets are considering many differing points of view, ``but not
all are constructive,'' the Soviet leader said.
   ``Some are purely emotional, and this has been causing some
negative reactions,'' he said.
   He offered no proposals for dealing with the problem.
   Gorbachev said people in the Baltic republics were legitimately
concerned about many things, including the migration of ethnic
Russians.
   The three Baltic republics _ Estonian, Lithuania, and Latvia _
were independent after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until 1940,
when they were absorbed by the Soviet Union under a secret agreement
between Stalin and Hitler.

   President-elect George Bush, moving to make
good on a campaign pledge to stress ethics in government, got off to
a fast start last week by asking his transition staff to promise
they would avoid conflicts of interest.
   Specialists in government ethis praised the actions Bush has
taken in the two weeks since his election, but they said the real
test of his administration's commitment to clean government will
come later.
   ``When someone trips up, Bush has to live up to his promise and
take action against that person, difficult as it may be,'' said
Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University and an
ethics specialist.
   Bernard Wruble, the first man to head the Office of Government
Ethics which was established under the 1978 Ethics In Government
Act, agreed. ``The moment he has one bad apple, he has to act in a
very positive manner,'' Wruble said.
   An administration's ethical climate ``comes from the president,''
he said.
   Bush ordered his transition staff to sign a ``standards of
conduct'' declaration that requires them to disqualify themselves
from matters in which they might have a financial conflict.
   Robert M. Teeter, co-director of Bush's transition office, said
the pledges were meant to ``emphasize to the public once again that
they can have full confidence in the people who he hires to do the
public's business for him.''
   Throughout his public life, Bush has stressed ``ethics and
standards of conduct,'' Teeter said.
   The White House announced Saturday that President Reagan had
signed a memorandum ordering all federal officials who are working
with the transition team to sign the same ethics pledge required of
Bush's aides. The pledge includes a code-of-silence agreement that
officials will ``hold in confidence'' any information about
transition matters.
   During the presidential campaign, Democrats repeatedly raised the
so-called ``sleaze factor'' and said 11 top Reagan administration
officials had resigned under fire or were investigated, indicted or
convicted.
   The officials included two of Reagan's close personal friends,
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and former deputy White
House chief of staff Michael K. Deaver.
   In an apparent attempt to put distance between himself and the
Reagan administration on this issue, Bush said he would appoint a
``senior counselor'' for ethics, establish ethics offices in every
government agency and have mandatory annual briefings for ethics
officers. Each agency already has a designated ethics officer.
   Common Cause, the citizens' lobby, said Bush's transition pledge
``looks fine but there are other tests waiting,'' said Ann McBride,
the group's vice president.
   Specifically, Common Cause wants Bush to pressure Reagan to sign
the so-called ``revolving door'' bill which would clamp down on
lobbying by former members of Congress and former senior
administration officials.
   Congress passed the bill and Bush endorsed it, but Reagan has yet
to sign it into law. The measure establishes a one-year waiting
period before former high-ranking officials can lobby Congress or
the executive branch.
   The Bush administration also should close loopholes in the
campaign finance laws, she said.
   In one of his first acts after his Nov. 8 election, Bush
appointed C. Boyden Gray as his transition counsel. Gray, who will
become the White House legal adviser, is setting up procedures for
advising prospective federal appointees on financial disclosure
requirements.
   ``We're going to be a little more aggressive about anticipating
problems,'' Gray said.
   Gray already has met with officials from the Office of Government
Ethics, which oversees compliance with financial disclosure
requirements.
   Bush's people are ``very sincere'' in their efforts to ensure
that appointees ``adhere strictly to the letter of the law,'' said
Donald Campbell, deputy director of the ethics office.
   A major task involves financial disclosure forms. Transition
officials will examine the forms to spot potential trouble areas,
such as corporate severance pay, Campbell said. For instance,
severance cannot be paid to a new government employee to supplement
his income.
   All government officials appointed by the president or holding a
civil service rank of grade 16 or above must complete the forms
listing income, assets and liabilities. Pay for a grade 16 starts at
about $67,000.
   Forms for about 1,000 presidential appointees are reviewed by the
designated ethics official at each government agency as well as by
the ethics office. Failure to follow the legal requirements can lead
to criminal prosecution.
   In the campaign, Bush also endorsed the special prosecutor law
that the Reagan administration opposed. He said the law also should
apply to members of Congress. On the last day before he resigned in
August, Meese signed an order that expanded the law to cover
Congress.
   Meese was investigated twice by independent counsels on
allegations of financial conflict of interest, but no charges were
ever filed against him.
   Last July, independent counsel James McKay concluded that Meese
probably broke two tax laws.
   Deaver was convicted of lying to a grand jury and a House
subcommittee which investigated his lobbying activities after he
left the White House staff. Deaver was fined $100,000, ordered to
perform 1,500 hours of community service and placed on probation for
three years.

   Two women have been accused of using
claims of supernatural powers and ceremonies with live chickens to
extort thousands of dollars from superstitious customers.
   Gardenia Ann Ephraim, 42, and her daughter, Mary Ann Ephraim, 22,
both of West Hartford, were arrested late Thursday at a rented house
occupied by 14 people.
   The two were arraigned Friday on charges of first-degree larceny
by extortion and fortunetelling and other fraudulent practices. They
were being held in lieu of $100,000 each.
   Their arrests culminated a monthlong investigation into a
complaint by a 37-year-old West Hartford man. The man and his wife
had sought assistance from the women _ whom he knew as ``Helene''
and ``Helena'' _ for help in overcoming his impotence so he and his
wife could have children.
   According to police, the women convinced the man that he and his
wife were possessed by evil. To rid themselves of the evil, the
couple paid $32,000 in cash and goods between March and
mid-November, police said.
   A police affidavit described a series of bizarre spiritual
sessions. On the first visit, the man was given an egg and told to
put it under his mattress to absorb evil from him. Another time, the
two were instructed to bring two live chickens. The wife was then
told to breathe into one chicken's mouth, and the chicken died 20
minutes later. The couple then paid $600 to bury the chicken and the
evil it contained, and an additional $400 to bury the other chicken.
   The man continued to visit the house for months, police said.
   West Hartford police started the investigation after a friend of
the man's mother told a New Britain police detective about the
amount of money involved.
   Lt. Stephen Lovett, of the West Hartford special investigations
division, said the man told investigators that he had introduced the
women to four people he knew who needed spiritual help. Police have
been unable to make contact with the four, but the money involved in
all five cases, according to the man's statements, totals $107,000,
Lovett said.
   Lovett said the two women and the others in the house appeared to
be living well. Police found expensive furniture and furnishings,
videocameras and stereo equipment. Three vehicles parked in back
included a Porsche, he said.
   Police did not know how many other people paid money to the
spiritualists, Lovett said. People who seek their help usually do so
after seeing advertisements in fliers or Portugese- and
Italian-language newspapers.
   Steven F. Meo, a lawyer representing the two women, told the
court they have lived in Connecticut for about five years and each
woman has an arrest record in Connecticut for fortunetelling.
   Police have recovered $1,500 and safety deposit-box keys from six
banks in Connecticut and seven in New York and New Jersey. The banks
have been notified and Lovett said police would seek a court order
to freeze the contents.
   Undercover officers arrested a third woman at the house in March
after paying $40 to have their fortunes read.

   The California Supreme Court has entered
uncharted legal water as it attempts to determine the
constitutionality of Proposition 103, the voter-approved measure
slashing insurance rates.
   The justices are pondering a case that has no direct legal
precedent in a state where insurance rates have never been
regulated, and the court hasn't decided whether it will hear the
case or refer it to a lower court.
   But with many insurers restricting or eliminating California
coverage in response to Proposition 103, and with the Legislature
and Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's administration seemingly
looking for direction, all sides want a quick resolution.
   The court responded to insurers' lawsuits on Nov. 10 by blocking
enforcement of a 20 percent rate reduction and other provisions of
the initiative approved by voters two days earlier.
   While the court has often been sympathetic to business concerns,
it also advocates judicial restraint, which generally includes
deferring to voters.
   Insurers are challenging many provisions of the measure, an
initiative sponsored by consumer advocate Ralph Nader that was the
only one of five insurance-related measures to win voter approval
Nov. 8.
   The central features of the case are these:
   _Proposition 103 requires that rates for motor vehicle, homeowner
and other property and casualty insurance be rolled back to November
1987 levels and then reduced 20 percent and frozen until November
1989. Insurers could win exemptions only by showing a ``substantial
threat of insolvency.'' The companies contend the cut and freeze
amount to confiscation of property.
   _Starting in November 1989, the measure requires the state
insurance commissioner to approve all rate increases for those same
types of insurance, prohibiting any rates that are ``excessive,
inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.'' Although that language has
been upheld in other states, insurers contend it is virtually
meaningless in California because the expected volume of rate
requests will make the process unworkable.
   _A company will be allowed to refuse to renew an auto insurance
policy only for non-payment or fraud by the policy-holder or a
substantial increase in the insured risk. Insurers contend the
provision would effectively prohibit them from withdrawing from the
auto insurance business in California, in violation of their
property rights.
   Other provisions include an additional 20 percent cut in November
1989 for ``good drivers'' as defined by the measure; auto insurance
rates based primarily on a driver's safety record, annual mileage
and experience; conversion of the insurance commissioner's job to an
elected office in 1990; repeal of the industry's exemption from
state antitrust laws; and required disclosure of insurance company
finances. Insurers contend those issues cannot be separated from the
rate rollback and must also be thrown out.
   The justices cannot consult any prior California cases on the
rate rollback and freeze issue because the state has never regulated
the prices of insurance or any similar commodity. Utility rates are
controlled under a separate body of laws.
   Some roughly similar constitutional issues arose, however, in
cases in 1976 and 1984 involving challenges by landlords to rent
control measures in Berkeley. Both sides in the insurance case rely
heavily on these rulings.
   The court concluded in the two cases the government could roll
back rates to earlier levels, but that property owners were entitled
to rate increases giving them a ``fair return on investment'' under
reasonably prompt administrative procedures.
   The two sides in the Proposition 103 case disagree over whether
state review of insurance rates will be cumbersome or prompt. More
fundamentally, they disagree over the constitutionality of requiring
insurers to cut their rates 20 percent for a year unless they can
show a ``substantial threat of insolvency.''
   Insurers say those provisions violate the ``fair return on
investment'' standard recognized in the rent control cases and force
them to operate at a loss without relief and requiring a company to
claim a threat of insolvency to seek an exemption would scare away
investors and policy-holders.

   Secular and Moslem fundamentalist
students fired pistols and hurled homemade bombs at each other,
leaving two people dead and 70 injured at a university in
northwestern Bangladesh, police said Saturday.
   Police said five of the injured were in critical condition after
the fight Friday, which started when a secular student ripped down a
poster put up by fundamentalists at Rajshahi University, 120 miles
northwest of Dhaka.
   Authorities closed the university indefinitely and ordered the
8,000 students to leave their dormitories.
   ``The situation in the town, especially around the campus is
quite tense,'' a Rajshahi police officer said when contacted by
telephone. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police identified the dead students as Aslam Hussain, 23, and Ali
Asghar, 20, both members of the fundamentalist Islam Chatra Shibit,
a student organization of the Jamaat-e-Islami political party.
   Most of the secular students involved in the fight belonged to
the Central Students Action Committee, police said.

   President Reagan praised the productivity of
America's farms and factories Saturday and said Americans of all
faiths should ``ask the Lord's blessing'' at Thanksgiving.
   ``As we, of whatever faith we are, give praises to his name, let
us thank him for our peace, prosperty and freedom,'' the president
said.
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address delivered from the Oval
Office, recalled the tale of the Pilgrim settlers who asked their
Indian neighbors to join them in the first Thanksgiving celebration.
   ``Together they sat around their bountiful table and bowed their
heads in gratitude to the Lord for all that he had bestowed upon
them. This week, so many years later, we too will gather with family
and friends and, after saying grace, carve up the turkey, pass
around the cranberries and dressing, and later share slices of
pumpkin pie,'' Reagan said.
   The president noted that even though much of the nation suffered
this year from a disastrous drought, farmers were able to harvest
more food than the nation could eat and were able to export food
overseas.
   ``Not only we, but the entire world can be thankful for that,''
he said. ``Millions of children across all the continents are
happier, healthier and stronger because of America's farmers.''
   The president also pointed with pride to the nation's economy,
contending that America's factories are ``zipping along at
capacity'' and that the work force is producing ``so efficiently
that no one can touch them.''
   But besides the nation's prosperity, Americans should also be
grateful for the decades of peace and personal freedom they have
enjoyed, Reagan said.
   ``Think of those around the world who can't bow their heads in
prayer without risking their lives,'' Reagan said. ``Think of how
blessed we are to be Americans.''

<HEAD>Democrat Calls For Pre-Inauguration Meeting With Bush On Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic senator called Saturday for
President-elect George Bush to meet with congressional leaders prior
to his inauguration to find ``common ground'' for fighting the
deficit.
   Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee noted the declining dollar and the
drop in the stock market since Bush's election, and said the world
is waiting to see if the incoming president has a plan for reducing
the country's massive federal deficit.
   ``Congress, like the financial markets and the Federal Reserve,
is anxiously seeking a sign from the incoming administration that
the era of ideological stalemate is over, and the era of realistic
deficit reduction has begun,'' said Sasser, in the Democrats'
response to President Reagan's weekly radio address.
   Reagan, in his broadcast, said the nation's factories are booming
and farmers harvested more than the country could consume. He urged
Americans on Thanksgiving to thank the Lord for ``peace, prosperity
and freedom.''
   Sasser said Democrats in Congress want to work with the new
president for positive results ``but we can't wait for the next
financial disaster before we again take the budget deficit
seriously.''
   ``And let me say to President-elect Bush: many of us in the
Congress are experienced lip readers. We don't want new taxes any
more than you do,'' said Sasser, addressing Bush's promise not to
raise taxes.
   ``We stand ready to follow the new president's lead, so long as
that leadership aims honestly and forthrightly at solving this
country's number one economic problem,'' he said.
   Sasser proposed that a meeting of Bush with congressional leaders
``should aim specifically at getting to the common ground _ the
objectives we all share _ with regard to fiscal policy.''
   He said Bush also should give a fair hearing to the National
Economic Commission set up to deal with the deficit and should get
the Reagan administration to submit a realistic budget to Congress.
   ``Those are the kinds of meaningful actions that will command the
confidence of the international financial community,'' Sasser said.
``They will help put to rest the rumors of early conflict between
the Congress and the next president.''

   Muscovites lined up in a driving snow Saturday to
view an exhibit of the injustices of the Stalin years, when millions
of their compatriots vanished into the hell of prisons and labor
camps and never returned.
   ``A Christian cannot be a good Christian without recognizing that
he's a sinner,'' said one of the exhibit's organizers, historian
Nikita G. Okhotin. ``How can one be a Soviet without recognizing the
errors made in his nation's past?''
   In the columned cultural hall of a Moscow light bulb factory, the
``Week of Conscience'' opened with a jarring reminder of abuses
committed during the 1924-1953 rule of Josef Stalin, whose legacy of
terror has been repudiated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The weeklong exhibit, which will include films, discussions and
tributes to Stalin's victims, was sponsored by the weekly magazine
Ogonyok, which has been in the vanguard of Gorbachev's campaign for
``glasnost'' or greater candor _ including frankness about the dark
pages of Soviet history.
   ``The memorial will be the manifestation of the grief of the
people for millions of their compatriots, unjustifiably repressed,
and will mean their political rehabilitation,'' Ogonyok editor
Vitaly Korotich told the Tass news agency before the exhibit opened
in the hall, which belongs to the factory and was built for the
employees.
   The ``Week of Conscience'' is another blow to the reputation of
Stalin, whose repressions and harsh central controls are now blamed
by Gorbachev and his followers for many of the nation's political,
social and economic ills.
   In a side room at the cultural hall, a wooden board twice as high
as a man bears pieces of paper with the names of thousands of
Russians, Jews, Armenians and others arrested in 1937, at the height
of what historians call Stalin's ``Great Purge.''
   Each sheet carries the laconic notice ``VMN,'' the
Russian-language initials for ``Highest Measure of Punishment,'' the
euphemism then used to designate the death penalty.
   Western historians estimate that 8 million to 10 million Soviets
died in the 1936-38 Great Purge, when Stalin was ridding the Soviet
Communist Party, government and society of both real and imagined
opponents.
   Many victims were posthumously rehabilitated by Nikita S.
Khrushchev following Stalin's death in 1953, and others have had
charges against them wiped from the judicial record. But the fate of
countless others remains unknown.
   Reseachers like Okhotin from the group ``Memorial'' spoke to more
than 100 Soviets seeking news about family members or friends
swallowed up by the vast network of prisons and labor camps that
Alexander Solzhehnitsyn dubbed ``the Gulag archipelago.''
   Tatyana Vasileyevna of Moscow gave reseachers a portrait of her
grandfather, Mikhail M. Gerasimov, a Moscow physicist who once was
photographed as an honored worker alongside Stalin and his henchman
Lavrenti Beria, but in 1937 was arrested and shot.
   ``Maybe his picture will help somebody else track down someone
near and dear to them,'' Mrs. Vasileyevna said.
   Some exhibits inspired pity and sorrow. Vasily P. Petrovsky,
then-director of the light bulb factory, was arrested in 1938 and
shot. A collage of photographs and documents told the sad story of
his family.
   ``Our family, my sister and myself, experienced all the circles
of hell for belonging to a family of `enemies of the people,'''
Petrovsky's daughter wrote. ``But never did we have a desire to
leave the motherland ... After the victory (in World War II), we
sang songs in praise of Stalin, the wise, the dear, and the
beloved.''
   A wheelbarrow bearing a sign saying ``for the memorial to the
victims of Stalin's repression'' was filled with five- and 10-ruble
notes donated by visitors. Some wrote the names of family members
killed in the purges on banknotes before tossing them in.
   The ruling Politburo authorized the building of a monument in
Moscow to Stalin's victims this year, and dozens of designs were on
diplay.
   One shows a hammer and sickle, the symbol of the Soviet state.
But the hammer is smeared with blood, and the sickle broken.
   One woman proposed construction of a ``fountain of tears.''
   Stalin has his defenders among those who long for the order he
epitomized, and arguments broke out when some visitors criticized
the anti-Stalinist theme.
   ``How dare they criticize one man. We were all guilty of
wrongdoing,'' exclaimed a Russian man in his 50s.
   ``That's rubbish!'' shot back a bearded neighbor. ``They want us
to believe that. It lets those who were really guilty escape.''

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill To Stiffen Penalties for Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Saturday
designed to counter the wave of insider trading scandals that rocked
Wall Street several years ago and shook the confidence of the
nation's investors.
   The measure doubles the maximum criminal penalties for insider
trading from five years in jail to 10 years, and boost fines from
$500,000 to $2.5 million for a company and from $100,000 to $1
million for an individual.
   It also holds firms liable to fines for the actions of their
employees if the firms ``knowingly or recklessly'' fail to detect
and prevent insider trading.
   Contrary to some of the publicity given to other bill signings in
recent weeks, the White House simply put out a brief announcement
that Reagan had signed the bill. Congress passed the legislation in
the final days of Congress in October.
   ``Greed and fear are competing emotions, but until now there has
not been a proper balance between the two. I think now the fear of
apprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure of
greed,'' Rep. Edward J. Markey, D- Mass., chief sponsor of the bill
and chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the securities
markets, said after the measure's final passage.
   Markey predicted the bill will change attitudes toward insider
trading, a crime that is both hard to detect and difficult to prove,
because, he maintained white collar criminals fear the prospects of
going to jail.
   The legislation would also:
   -Authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer
tipsters a bounty of up to 10 percent of any fine collected.
   -Codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lost
money by trading in the same securities and at the same time as
insiders.
   -Permit the SEC to issue subpoenas and investigate insider
trading on behalf of foreign countries, with the idea that foreign
countries would offer reciprocal privileges to the United States.
   The SEC and the industry had been pushing for a legislative
definition of insider trading, which until now has been defined by
regulators and the courts.
   But, to win the support of House Energy and Commerce Chairman
John Dingell, D-Mich., the bill left insider trading undefined.
   Dingell believes a written definition would in effect become a
road map to evasion, providing defense attorneys with loopholes. The
industry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, delivered from the Oval Office:
   My fellow Americans, over 350 years ago a small band of Pilgrims,
after gathering in their first harvest at Plymouth colony, invited
their friends and neighbors who were Indians to join them in a feast
of Thanksgiving.
   Together they sat around their bountiful table and bowed their
heads in gratitude to the Lord for all he had bestowed upon them.
   This week, so many years later, we too will gather with family
and friends, and after saying grace, carve up a turkey, pass around
the cranberries and dressing and later share slices of pumpkin pie.
   We Americans have so much for which to be thankful. Think of the
great expanse of our nation, the rolling hills of our immense
farmland. Even in years of drought, as this year has been, the plows
and the sweat of America's farmers call forth from our good earth
more food than we can possibly eat; so much food that taken
together, our harvests of wheat, corn, soybeans, fruits, vegetables
and all the other bounty of our land make up one of our most
important exports.
   Not only we, but the entire world can be thankful for that.
Millions of children across all the continents are happier,
healthier and stronger because of America's farmers.
   Now, think of our manufacturing centers. After almost a decade of
hard, often painful work cultivating our industrial fields to meet a
whole new generation of world competition, this year we can see the
first harvest of that work. Almost every American industry is
zipping along at near full capacity.
   A few years ago, journalists were calling the Midwest the rust
belt. Now the boom belt would be more like it. From Lehigh Valley in
eastern Pennsylvania, to Dayton and Detroit and beyond, the factory
whistles again sound (in) the old factory towns and we hope they'll
blow soon where they don't now.
   By the way, often those whistles are at the plants of entirely
new companies, providing new products and services to the nation and
to the world.
   In the past year, America added 425,000 new manufacturing jobs,
and when it comes to world competition, no one can stop us now and
that's not the only good news. According to one of the foremost
authorities in manufacturing, Peter Drucker, the old myth about low
wages and low manufacturing costs may be dead for good.
   In this age of high technology factories, highly paid skilled
workers, America's kind of workers, produce so efficiently that no
one can touch them. That's why it's gratifying, but not surprising,
to find out that America's manufacturing productivity has grown at
one-and-a-half times the post-war average during our expansion. And
that's why this year, even as European and Japanese manufacturing
employment has stagnated, our manufacturing employment has increased.
   But prosperity is not an end in itself. It helps us pay attentio
to the more important things: raising our children as we want them
to be raised, helping others in need, and bringing nations together
in peace.
   This week world peace has been very much on my mind. Here in
Washington we've received visits from two of America's friends,
Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and Germany's
Chancellor, Helmut Kohl. In our meetings, these two great leaders
and I talked about the prosperity that all the nations of the
industrial world enjoy, and about the cuts in taxes and the return
to the principles of the free market that have made it possible.
   And we talked about the success over the past eight years of our
policy of peace through strength.
   Yes, peace is another thing for which we can say a prayer of
gratitude over the dinner table on Thursday. Peace and abundance in
this land that God has kissed.
   We will give thanks for these and one thing more, our freedom.
Yes, in America freedom seems like the air around us. It's there,
it's sweet, though we rarely give it a thought. Yet, as the air
fills our lungs, freedom fills our souls. It gives breath to our
laughter and joy. It gives voice to our songs. It gives us strength
as we race for our dreams.
   Think of those around the world who cannot bow their heads in
prayer without risking their lives. Think of those countries where
to write an honest word, or even to own a child's simple toy
printing press, is a crime. Think of how many countries where to
dream of striking out on your own and starting a business is to take
a chance, not on a better life for yourself and your children, but
on a long stay in a prison cell.
   And then think about how blessed we are to be Americans. Yes, as
we gather together this Thanksgiving to ask the Lord's blessings, as
we of whatever faith we are, give praises to his name, let us thank
him for our peace, prosperity and freedom.
   Happy Thanksgiving. And, until next week, thanks for listening,
and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   When honey-voiced Dorothea Montalvo
Puente strolled away from a detective Nov. 11, it was only her
latest escape from the clutches of an often bumbling officialdom
that missed evidence of wrongdoing.
   Puente fled to Los Angeles while police dug up seven bodies in
the yard of her Victorian boardinghouse. Five days later, after a
search in Nevada, California and Mexico, police arrested her and
charged her with one count of murder.
   Prosecutors believe the victims were elderly tenants killed for
their Social Security money, and said they plan to file additional
murder charges against Puente, who in a TV interview admitted
cashing checks but denied killing anyone.
   Puente, 59, was known to state, federal, local and even private
social services officials long before police unearthed the bodies.
   In fact, she served 2{ years in prison for drugging and robbing
three elderly men she met in a bar, and is still on parole in a
separate, 1980 case for forging a government check belonging to an
elderly person.
   A partial list of the authorities that had contact with Puente
reads like a ``Who's Who'' of government bureaucracies: federal
parole officials, police, welfare workers, the Social Security
Administration, county mental health officials, health inspectors
and social workers.
   They all apparently missed evidence of wrongdoing at her
boardinghouse.
   For example:
   _Federal parole officials assigned to Puente because of her 1978
conviction for forging a U.S. Treasury check belonging to an elderly
person monitored her once a month but never discovered she had
violated two key provisions of her parole _ handling Treasury checks
and associating with the elderly and disabled. She remains on parole
through 1990. Charlie Varnon, Justice Department chief probation
officer in Sacramento, told the San Francisco Examiner that agents
never saw evidence indicating she had been running a boardinghouse,
but he acknowledged they never looked further than her upstairs
apartment.
   _Accusations that Puente poisoned and robbed two elderly women
led to an investigation that resulted in her conviction in 1982 on
drug, forgery and theft charges in the case involving the men she
met in a bar. She was sentenced to five years and was released in
1985. Despite her criminal record, however, county social workers
had been referring elderly people to her boardinghouse. The county
Health Department said Friday it is investigating whether social
service and mental health workers should have been aware that
Puentes' boarders were at risk.
   _Neighbors complained to health officials twice, in May and
September, about a stench from the grounds of Puente's
boardinghouse. Both times, authorities found nothing in the yard.
The corpses had been in the ground as long as 10 months, forensic
anthropologists said. Puente blamed the smell on a fish emulsion
fertilizer. ``She said it was the fertilizer,'' said neighbor Will
McIntyre. Another neighbor recalled that ``flies were always all
over the place.''
   _Social Security personnel apparently never determined whether
the addressees of government payments cashed their benefit checks,
police said. Police said Puente had authority to cash some but not
all of the checks linked to the investigation.
   After the first body was discovered at her home Nov. 11, Puente
was interviewed for several hours by Sacramento detectives. But she
was allowed to walk to a nearby motel to meet a friend, and was not
seen again until her arrest Wednesday in Los Angeles.
   ``We had no reason to hold her, there was no probable cause,''
said police spokesman Sgt. Bob Burns. ``You have to have a
justification to arrest somebody. It was the decision of the officer
interviewing her that she should not be held.''
   There also was never any thought of placing her under
surveillance, Burns said. Police Chief John Kearns called the
decision not to follow her ``a judgment call'' and conceded that
police made an error.

   Walter Slovekosky knew something was
terribly wrong 20 years ago Sunday when the headlights of his
electric mine locomotive began blinking wildly 400 feet underground
in Consolidation Coal Co.'s No. 9 mine.
   ``I kept trying to call a foreman on the trolley phone to find
out what was going on,'' Slovekosky said. ``I waited and I waited.
But no one answered me.
   ``That's when I told my buddy, `Let's get out of here. There's
something bad wrong.' But we didn't know how bad.''
   Slovekosky, 70, and his brakeman were among 21 miners who made
their way out of the smoky, flame-filled labyrinth after the first
of a series of methane explosions rocked the mine at 5:25 a.m. on
Nov. 20, 1968. Methane gas, the major component of natural gas, is a
constant threat in coal seams.
   Seventy-eight died in the explosions and fires, which set in
motion the landmark federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act passed
by Congress the next year.
   ``You live through one of those nightmares, I'll tell you, you
never forget it,'' said Slovekosky, who planned to mark the
anniversary with a prayer Sunday at a black stone memorial to the
dead miners.
   Coal mining has been one of the nation's most hazardous
industrial occupations. Since the turn of the century, more than
20,000 miners have died in accidents in West Virginia alone.
   Twenty major explosions and many more minor ones rocked the
mine's 100 miles of tunnels for nine days.
   The explosions threw the shaft's elevator carriage into the air.
Concrete blocks from the lamp house were hurled into the parking
lot, crushing parked automobiles. Smoke billowed 150 feet into the
air.
   A motel operator in Fairmont 12 miles away felt the blast and
thought the back of his motel was blowing up.
   ``The coal company wanted to seal the mine,'' Slovekosky said.
``They knew the situation was hopeless. But the widows kept
screaming, `You can't seal it. You can't seal it.'''
   Finally, they sealed the mine on Nov. 30, 1968, to extinguish the
fires feeding on methane and coal. But officials of Pittsburgh-based
Consolidation Coal vowed that all 78 bodies would be recovered.
   The mine was reopened and recovery operations began in September
1969.
   ``Sometimes, I still lie in bed at night and think about it. We
know some of them didn't die instantly,'' Slovekosky said. ``We
found the miners sitting with their lunch pails open, like they were
just waiting to be rescued.
   ``You wonder what would be going through your mind if you were
sitting down there and you knew you were going to die?''
   But after Consolidation Coal spent nearly 10 years and $11
million, the search was abandoned in April 1978 with 19 men still
missing because of deteriorating working conditions, including water
seepage.
   Millions of tons of coal will remain unmined because of federal
and state orders, and especially because of a miners' tradition
against taking coal from a mine when miners' bodies are still inside.
   ``All us widows tried to make them get all the men out,'' said
Sara Lee Kaznoski, whose husband, Pete J. Kaznoski Sr., is among
those entombed in the mine. ``I still feel they could have recovered
all those men and given them a decent burial.''
   She and six other widows eventually agreed to accept the
company's $10,000 settlement offers, plus joint title to more than
250 acres of land.
   ``It was a long war with many battles, don't think it wasn't,''
said Kaznoski, who lives in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ``We got some laws
passed and did a lot for the families of other miners, even though
it was too late for us.''
   Slovekosky blamed the explosion on carelessness.
   ``They've never pointed a finger at anyone, but what's the
point,'' he said. ``It's over. A lot of people have died or moved
away. The problem was people were willing to take chances.
   ``It's like driving a car. You keep taking chances, somebody's
going to get you, sooner or later.''

   Authorities Saturday were searching for a man
spotted near the scene of a bomb blast that damaged the Geneva
office of the Soviet airline Aeroflot and injured five people,
including two American tourists.
   Four victims remained hospitalized with leg wounds and burns.
   Authorities examined clues in the rubble of the explosion, which
occurred on a busy downtown sidewalk at the start of Friday's
evening rush hour.
   The bomb, hidden in a sidewalk wastebasket, shattered the front
window of the Aeroflot office on the ground floor of a building also
housing two Arab banks. The injured were passers-by.
   Police were looking for an unidentified man in his 20s who was
spotted near the wastebasket before the blast, spokesman Marcel
Vaudroz said. Vaudroz said the intended target of the attack
remained a mystery.
   Police and the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office were questioning
the seriousness of a caller to Swiss television Friday who claimed
the attack in the name of a previously unknown Socialist Nationalist
Front. The caller said communists, capitalists and Jews were the
target, the TV station reported.
   Roland Hauenstein, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said
the probe was expected to take some time.
   Anne-Florence Dami, a spokeswoman at a Geneva hospital where the
four victims remained, said all were in stable condition.
   They included Helen Mattheis, 22, of Cincinnati, who underwent
surgery to remove shrapnel from her legs.
   The fifth victim, Ms. Mattheis' mother, Eula Bingham, 59, also of
Cincinatti, was treated for ear problems Friday night and released.
   Ms. Bingham, a vice president and dean at the University of
Cincinnati, called the university to say her daughter was recovering
well after the surgery. University officials reported Ms. Bingham
told them she returned to her hotel after the blast but was having
trouble hearing. She was said to be in Geneva to deliver a paper at
a World Health Organization meeting.
   Also still hospitalized were an Italian man, 34, a Frenchwoman,
60, and a Frenchman, 21. Police withheld their identities.

   A Leningrad worker who wrote ``threatening and
libelous'' letters to party, government and police officials in the
name of a right-wing organization has been sentenced to 18 months
probation, Tass said Saturday.
   Criminal investigators tracked down Arkady Norinsky after he
mailed letters signed ``Gunmen of the Pamyat Patriotic
Organization'' to Leningrad residents in July and August, the
official news agency said. It said Norinsky admitted writing the
letters.
   Pamyat, or ``Memory'' in Russian, is a private group that blames
Russia's ills on a conspiracy of Jews, Freemasons and foreigners.
Tass said Norinsky denied any links with the group and that he wrote
the letters in an effort to discredit it.
   ``He attributed his actions to a feeling of indignation at the
content of speeches delivered by some Pamyat leaders,'' Tass said.
``He mailed the threats guided by a desire `to condition some
influential people in the city against Pamyat.'''
   Tass gave no examples of the threats contained in the letters.

   Two dolphins stranded in the swimming pool of
a luxury hotel overlooking the Nile for the past year are to be
flown to an aquarium on the French Riviera.
   Leo and Nemo were brought to Cairo from Switzerland to perform
for guests of the Meridien Hotel and were abandoned after their
contract ended May 31. Their Swiss owner, the International Dolphin
Show Co., said it had nowhere to keep the mammals.
   The two dolphins have become lethargic, swimming in endless
circles around the pool, said Edouard Speck, the hotel's general
manager.
   ``We are now concerned with the safety of the animals,'' he said.
``We can't guarantee their safety and well-being in the pool. They
were becoming weak.''
   The two mammals are to be flown Wednesday to the Marine Land
aquarium in Antibes, on the southeast coast of France.
   To prepare them for the trip, the dolphins will be coated with
grease so they can retain their moisture and will be strapped to
hanging mats, Speck said. British veterinarian David Taylor, who is
preparing the animals for the transfer, also has given them vitamins.
   Speck said the hotel plans to sue the International Dolphin Show
Co. to determine who owns the dolphins.
   ``This is not a confiscation,'' he said. ``We will go to court
later to see whom the animals belong to, who should pay their
expenses. I don't think they will return to the owner. He can't take
care of animals.''
   Bruno Lienhardt, owner of the Swiss company, was traveling and
unavailable for comment.
   Speck said he pressed Egypt's Ministry of Agriculture for
permission to transfer the dolphins. The dolphins will remain under
the control of the Egyptian government pending a court decision.
   ``Whenever the Egyptian government wants them back, they will
have to come back,'' he said.
   Leo and Nimo, born respectively in 1979 and 1980, were brought to
the Meridien in November 1987. Their show was opened by President
Hosni Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, and was a big success, especially
during weekly performances for poor children.
   After the summer season began in May, the dolphins remained in
the hotel's main pool on a veranda overlooking the Nile River.
Guests had to use a smaller pool designed for winter use.
   International Dolphin Show paid the dolphins' expenses through
last August. Since then, the hotel has spent about $565 a month for
the mammals' two meals of frozen fish a day and weekly check-ups by
a veterinarian.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address:
   I'm Jim Sasser, United States Senator from Tennessee. This week
the world's financial markets have registered strong doubts about
America's resolve to deal with the massive budget deficits we've
built up over the past eight years.
   The message from London, from Tokyo, and the other financial
markets is clear: the day of rhetoric and empty phrases is long
past. As a nation, we've got to demonstrate a serious determination
to get our financial house in order.
   That message was reinforced just this past Wednesday when the
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board offered a Hobson's choice:
either we get on with the business of serious deficit reduction or
else the Federal Reserve Board will ratchet up interest rates and
possibly induce a recession.
   The markets, the Federal Reserve, they're both putting the
president-elect and this Congress on notice. The declining dollar,
the one-hundred dollar drop on Wall Street since election day, the
threat of higher interest rates, those are the clearest possible
indications that we must act and act now.
   The emphasis is very much on our will to work together
cooperatively. As Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, made clear, the world isn't waiting to see what kind
of plan we're going to use to get the deficits down, it's waiting to
see if there is any plan at all.
   We all know it took a financial disaster of immense proportions
to end the political posturing of nearly eight years. Only after the
stock market crash of last October did the president finally agree
to join the Congress at the bargaining table. The resulting
bipartisan agreement reduced the deficit by some seventy-six billion
dollars over two years.
   I know that I speak for many of my colleagues in the Congress
when I say that we want to work with the president-elect towards the
same positive result, but we can't wait for the next financial
disaster before we again take the budget deficit seriously.
   Congress, just like the financial markets and the Federal
Reserve, is anxiously seeking a signal from the incoming
administration that the era of ideological stalemate is over and the
era of realistic deficit reduction has at long last begun.
   Now, let me say this to President-elect Bush: many of us in this
Congress are very experienced lip readers indeed. We don't want new
taxes anymore than you do.
   We stand ready, though, to follow the president's lead so long as
that leadership aims honestly and forthrightly at solving this
country's number one economic problem.
   In my judgment, the president-elect could begin to send the right
signals to the world financial community and the Congress by doing
three simple things:
   First, he ought to give a fair hearing to the National Economic
Commission. It's a distinguished group of experts, established by
the Congress and the Reagan administration, to help reach a national
consensus on the whole deficit problem.
   And second, he should meet, prior to inauguration day, with the
leadership of both houses of the Congress _ a meeting that should
aim at getting to a common ground, the objectives we all share in
bringing the deficits down.
   And finally, he should get the Reagan Administration to submit a
realistic budget to the Congress this January _ not a scorched-earth
budget that does away with needed domestic programs and certainly
not a document that makes a shrill political statement, but it's
dead on arrival in the halls of Congress.
   Those are the kinds of meaningful actions that will command the
confidence of the international financial community. They'll help to
put to rest the rumors of an early conflict between the Congress and
the president-elect. And I think they'll help prepare the way for an
economic program that will set this country on a stable foundation _
a foundation of economic growth and continually improving living
standards for all our people.

   Iranian radio said Saturday that former
President Jimmy Carter wrote to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini offering
to serve as a ``neutral American channel'' in efforts to free U.S.
hostages in Lebanon and improve U.S.-Iranian ties.
   Khomeini rejected the offer, Tehran Radio said.
   Carter issued a statement in Atlanta confirming he wrote a letter
to Khomeini but saying it was in response to an initiative from Iran.
   According to the radio report, monitored in Nicosia, Khomeini
issued a statement denying any connection between Iran and the
hostages in Lebanon. ``Just as I have said before, the relationship
of Iran and the United States is like the relationship of the wolf
and the lamb, and between these two there can never be
reconciliation,'' the statement said.
   The radio quoted Carter's letter as saying, ``I hope that the
American hostages in Lebanon can be released as soon as possible;
this act would remove one of the main hurdles in the
re-establishment of friendly relations between Iran and the U.S.''
   Carter's statement, read to The Associated Press by spokeswoman
Carrie Harmon, said: ``In my note, I was responding to an initiative
from Iran. My purpose was to obtain the release of David Rabhan, a
friend of mine who has been imprisoned in Iran for almost nine years.
   ``My hope is that in the name of justice and humanity, Iran will
use its influence to encourage the release of all American hostages
by working through normal channels.''
   Ms. Harmon did not identify Rabhan further or say why he was
imprisoned. She also said the full text of the letter would not be
released.
   Fourteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held by
Lebanese Shiite groups believed loyal to Iran. The hostage held
longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The radio said the letter, dated Oct. 30, was received by
Khomeini's office and that Iranian experts confirmed it was Carter's
handwriting.
   ``To stop this effort from becoming politicized in our country,
and delaying the release of the hostages, a neutral American channel
must be used, and we at the Carter Center are prepared to help in
every appropriate manner,'' the radio quoted the letter as saying.
   The Carter Center, opened in Atlanta in 1986, houses Carter's
presidential library as well as his office and is dedicated to
research and discussion of public policy.
   The radio quoted Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani as
saying he also received a letter from Carter about the hostages.
   ``I myself received such a letter from Carter alluding to the
sinister politics of ties with Iran and hostage-taking in Lebanon,''
the radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying.
   Ties between the United States and Iran were broken in 1979 when
Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held
diplomats hostage for 444 days. Carter has said the crisis, which
took place during his term as president, led to his defeat by Ronald
Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
   The radio said Khomeini ordered his letter made public in order
to ``prevent any kind of exploitation.'' It did not elaborate.

   Church members ended a monthlong quest
Saturday to offer their ``lard to the Lord,'' and two ministers said
they may have started a new dieting trend by getting ``slim for
Him.''
   Teams of dieters from Northfield Church in Gering and First
Assembly of God Church in Scottsbluff planned to weigh in Sunday to
see which congregation won a local contest after 30 days of cutting
calories for Christ.
   Both the Rev. Neal Hail of Scottsbluff, who earned the nickname
``Near-Ton Neal,'' and the Rev. ``Bulbous'' Bill Bibb of Gering were
confident their team would emerge victorious.
   ``We accepted the call to be small,'' said Hail, who dubbed his
team the ``First Fatties.'' He said his parishioners intend to
continue their diets after the contest in an effort to ``get slim
for Him.''
   Although he does not know yet how many pounds his team has lost,
Hail said he is convinced his squad lost the most weight and will
win the prize of a ``Great American Pig-Out'' hosted by the losing
team. To the losing pastor goes a Porky Pig statue.
   But Bibb said the ``Northfield Porkers'' expect to get the free
meal at First Assembly.
   ``Everybody feels good. Clothes are fitting better, and
everybody's looking good,'' Bibb said. He noted the contest has
garnered national and international attention for both churches.
   ``This has caught on all over the world,'' he said. ``I heard
from a minister in Brussels, Belgium, the other day wanting to know
about it.''

stroganoff for their teachers at a buffet luncheon.
   ``It was their own idea,'' said home economics teacher Elaine
Wells of her students at Honesdale High School. ``They've been

   The recipes were chosen from books on preparing wild game and
lunch was served Friday to 20 teachers.
   Class members shot most of the game near their homes in
northeastern Pennsylvania. The empty shotgun shells were combined
with dried leaves to make centerpieces to decorate the tables. The
student chefs worked all week preparing the dozen or so dishes using
ingredients such as turtle, squirrel, rabbit, pheasant, and raccoon.
   ``They've done a super job,'' Wells said. ``All the cleaning, all

<HEAD>President Signs Bill Tightening Prosecution Of Procurement Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation on Saturday
that imposes tough, new penalties against contractors who have
cheated the government.
   The measure, by making major procurement fraud a crime, hands
prosecutors a powerful new weapon to help protect the Pentagon's
complex purchasing process.
   The Defense Department has estimated that procurement fraud cost
taxpayers $99.1 million in fiscal years 1986 and 1987.
   Under the new law, those convicted of major fraud in government
purchasing could earn prison sentences of up to 10 years and fined
up to $10 million.
   A person or corporation would be subject to penalties under the
bill if convicted on a scheme or act to defraud the government in
connection with a contract of at least $1 million.
   The White House announced that Reagan had signed the bill along
with numerous other pieces of legislation. The House and Senate
passed the measure in late October.
   A statute of limitations of seven years would be established
under the bill in contrast to the normal one of five years.
   As well, the measure includes so-called ``whistle-blower''
protections to those drawing attention to major fraud.
   A whistle-blower protection provision allows anyone fired or
punished for furnishing information to the government to sue for
reinstatement, and receive twice the amount of lost pay.
   Among other things, the bill authorizes $8 million over four
years for hiring additional prosecutors to handle fraud cases.
   It also prohibits contractors from recovering legal expenses in
proceedings were the contractors were found to engage in wrongdoing.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the Senate sponsor of bill, said
shortly after it was passed that the bill was needed because
``defense fraud rips off American taxpayers and endangers the lives
of our fighting forces'' by providing them with defective parts.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutor Says North Case Centers on Lies and Deceit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra prosecutor argued Saturday that
slightly differing views on congressional power should not cloud the
central issues of lying and deceit in the criminal case against
Oliver L. North.
   Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh said a Justice Department
brief filed Friday in U.S. District Court did not go to the heart of
his case against North and instead was concerned with side issues of
constitutional law and the separation of powers.
   The Justice Department, in its friend-of-the-court brief, argued
that the case arose ``in the context of a policy dispute between the
executive and legislative branches with respect to foreign affairs.''
   However, Walsh wrote in a brief filed Saturday that the
department had misinterpreted his arguments.
   Walsh maintained that the independent counsel was not trying to
show that ``mere mere policy disagreements with Congress are
criminal'' or ``even that open defiance of enacted congressional
restrictions on foreign military ventures would be criminal.''
   Instead, he continued, North's actions became crimes when the
former National Security Council aide lied to Congress and tried to
obstruct inquiries into his activities.
   ``What converts a wrongful defiance of legal restrictions into
criminal activity is the effort to defeat operation of the law
through deceit, craft, or trickery, or at least by means that are
dishonest,'' Walsh wrote in the brief.
   North is charged with conspiring illegally to divert profits from
U.S. arms sales to Iran to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Also
charged are former national security adviser John M. Poindexter,
arms dealer Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.
   North, who is to be the first of the defendants to stand trial,
also is charged with 15 other felonies, including lying to Congress,
obstructing a presidential investigation and pocketing $90,000 in
travelers' checks from the Contras.
   No trial date has been set.
   Walsh minimized his differences with the department concerning
the lines of authority over foreign policy from the White House and
Capitol Hill.
   ``There is no substantial or relevant difference between the
views of executive power expressed by (the Justice Department) and
those advanced by the independent counsel's memorandum,'' Walsh
wrote.
   ``To the the extent that the department's submission has assisted
in clarifying those views, we hope this exchange has been helpful to
the court,'' Walsh wrote. ``We equally hope, however, that the
department's willingness to attribute divergent views to the
prosecution has not obscured the issues in this case, or the clear
fact that the department has conspicuously failed to support any of
the defendant's constitutional claims.''
   However, Walsh pointedly referred to the public manner in which
the Justice Department aired its disagreement with the prosecutor,
calling it ``well-publicized advocacy.''
   ``We note that the department's memorandum was distributed to the
press for presentation at a press conference before it was served on
independent counsel or filed with the court,'' said Walsh, who
released his own arguments after filing them with the court and
delivering a copy to the Justice Department.

   A male Rice University student who was elected
homecoming queen after entering the contest as a joke has decided to
surrender his crown for a day and escort the runner-up to the Cotton
Bowl.
   Michael Grubbs was snubbed by university officials when he asked
to be recognized during halftime ceremonies at Rice's homecoming
football game. And he also failed in his campaign to represent the
school with other Southwest conference homecoming queens at Cotton
Bowl festivities on New Year's Day.
   So Grubbs has agreed to serve as escort to his runner-up, Nancy
Jones, riding a float during the annual Dallas parade.
   ``We're both really psyched,'' Grubbs said. ``We're both ready to
have a great time.''
   Under Cotton Bowl rules, host school Arkansas will provide this
year's queen, while the other Southwest conference schhools will
send princesses for the queen's court.
   Cotton Bowl bylaws specify that each princess should be a
``popular co-ed.''
   The homecoming queen election has often been taken lightly by
Rice students, who previously have elected a dog and a refrigerator.
School officials reacted to the earlier elections by drafting a
policy saying the homecoming queen is not necessarily the school's
Cotton Bowl representative.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said Saturday his ``perestroika'' policy of social reform is
responsible for the surge of nationalism in Estonia, a Baltic
republic that has challenged Moscow's authority.
   But the Soviet leader, on the second day of a three-day visit,
said not all points raised in debates inspired by perestroika are
constructive.
   ``Some are purely emotional, and this has been causing some
negative reactions,'' Gorbachev said in his first public comments on
Estonia's challenge to the Kremlin.
   ``The country is thinking over what is happening,'' Gorbachev
said in response to a reporter's question during a visit to a
monument honoring the late Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi.
   ``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am
sure things will settle down,'' Gorbachev said. ``What is happening
in Estonia is perestroika.''
   The parliament of Estonia on Wednesday passed a constitutional
amendment asserting veto power over any new Soviet laws. Parliament
also declared sovereignty over all Estonian matters except those
involving defense and foreign affairs.
   Gorbachev said the problems in Estonia and the other two Baltic
states, Latvia and Lithuania, would be dealt with as part of his
program for social reform.
   ``We will find a solution to problems of concern to various
republics,'' Gorbachev said. ``Many things concern our friends. For
example, in placing various industries there have been some
mistakes. There has been migration and some deterioration of
environment.''
   By ``migration,'' he meant an influx of ethnic Russians into the
Baltic states.
   Gorbachev's comments, made in Russian and translated into English
by an aide, came after he had placed a wreath of red roses at a
memorial to Mrs. Gandhi on what would have been her 71st birthday.
   Later, he accepted a peace award named in honor of Mrs. Gandhi,
who was assassinated in 1984. He also conferred privately with Mrs.
Gandhi's son and successor, Rajiv Gandhi, and attended the closing
ceremony of a year-long Soviet cultural festival.
   Gorbachev used his speech accepting the award to criticize the
United States and Pakistan for their support of guerrillas fighting
Soviet troops and the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' he said during the speech
that was broadcast live and translated into English on India's
state-run television.
   He accused the two nations of creating obstacles for the Geneva
Accord that provided for the withdrawal of about 100,000 Soviet
troops from Afghanistan by February.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' he said. ``The danger inherent in it will soon make
it comparable to a threat of nuclear holocaust or environmental
catastrophe.''
   Police have arrested more than 200 Afghan refugees protesting
Gorbachev's visit to New Delhi, according to a prominent member of
the refugee community of 7,000. Police confirmed Afghans had been
detained but refused to give any figures.
   Syed Mohammad Maiwand, chairman of the International Afghan
Elders Association in New Delhi, said more than 150 Afghans were
arrested Thursday night. Maiwand said 63 more people were detained
during a demonstration outside a U.N. office Saturday.
   Police have ordered all Afghans in the city to stay in their
homes during Gorbachev's visit.
   During his speech, Gorbachev also spoke of the need for the
Soviet Union, China and India to have good relations.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations. Our own relations with China are also evolving in an
encouraging way,'' he said.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have long had strained relations
with China, and India and China went to war in 1962 over a
still-unresolved border dispute.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Giving Federal Workers Liability Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Saturday
that is intended to restore federal employees' immunity from being
sued for personal liability because of their actions on the job.
   The bill does not apply to lawsuits seeking damages from
government workers for alleged violations of constitutional rights.
   For many years, most federal employees were protected from
personal liability, or common law torts, under various court
decisions recognizing that immunity was necessary for them to
perform their duties.
   A Supreme Court decision last January had the effect of narrowing
that immunity, which would be restored under the bill that Reagan
signed Saturday.
   The bill provides that the exclusive remedy for personal
liability lawsuits would be legal action against the federal
government under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
   The bill, which passed Congress by voice votes of the House and
Senate, precludes all other civil actions for money damages based on
a federal employee's alleged negligent act.

   An estimated 240,000 people defied a
boycott called by the powerful Tamil guerrilla group and voted
Saturday in the Eastern Province to choose members to a local
administrative council.
   Indian soldiers provided heavy security around the polling
centers to prevent attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
the Tamil militia that threatened to disrupt the voting.
   There were no reports of violence during the voting but a Sri
Lankan military official said two Indian soldiers were killed Friday
when Tamil gunmen attacked four police stations in the region.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the attacks were an attempt to disrupt Saturday's elections.
   Deputy Election Commissioner Lakshman Perera said an estimated 40
percent of the 600,000 voters in the region cast their ballots. The
polls are for 35 seats on a council joining the multi-ethnic Eastern
Province with the predominantly-Tamil Northern Province.
   The 36 seats in the north were won unopposed by two Tamil groups
that supported an India-sponsored peace accord aimed at ending the
5-year-old war for an independent Tamil homeland.
   At least 8,500 people have been killed in the separatist war.
   The accord, signed in July 1987, provided for the setting up of
semi-autonomous provincial councils to appease the Tamil demand for
self-rule. But the Liberation Tigers, the largest and most powerful
Tamil militia, rejected the plan, saying it fell below expectations.
   The polls Saturday were being contested by the two Tamil groups,
the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and the Eelam
National Democratic Liberation Front, as well as the governing
United National Party and the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress. Results
were not expected until Sunday.
   The Liberation Tigers denounced the Tamil groups participating in
the polls as traitors and said the elections were an Indian
propaganda ploy.
   The Tigers are fighting Indian peacekeeping troops who were sent
to Sri Lanka to disarm the guerrillas and enforce the peace accord.
   India got involved in the ethnic conflict because of the
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.
   The Tigers say they need a separate homeland to protect their
minority community from what they claim is discrimination by the
majority Sinhalese.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. The mainly Hindu Tamils make up about 18
percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   Getting over the river and through the woods to
the family Thanksgiving feast via O'Hare International Airport _
always a challenge _ may be even tougher this year because of new
federal flight limits.
   And things don't look much better for Christmas, say travel
agents, airline and aviation officials.
   ``We're routinely advising our customers and clients of the,
let's say, congestion problems at major airports, particularly
O'Hare,'' said David Powell, American Express Travel Service vice
president.
   The new Federal Aviation Administration limits on the number of
flights allowed to arrive at O'Hare in a given hour are likely to
aggravate the problem at the nation's busiest airport.
   Following a startling 150 percent increase in the number of
errors by air traffic controllers at O'Hare this year, the FAA in
October ordered the airport to cut the number of arrivals from 96
per hour to 80 per hour between peak-travel times of 4:45 p.m. and
9:15 p.m.
   While the cutbacks, called a ``flow control program,'' were
designed to make skies safer, airlines acknowledge they also have
increased tardiness in a system in which delays never were uncommon.
   ``We have seen a definite impact from the flow control program,''
said spokesman Tom Stack of American Airlines, the second-largest
carrier at O'Hare.
   ``To give some example, in October of 1987 at O'Hare we were
above 95 percent in our arrivals within 15 minutes. That dropped to
about 75 percent in October of this year.''
   Airlines also no longer have a reserve of planes to help
accommodate heavy holiday traffic, said United Airlines spokesman
Joe Hopkins.
   While the number of flights over the holiday won't be up much _
about 2,300 total arrivals and departures per day _ the number of
people in the skies will be, as airlines see their planes filled to
capacity.
   Stack anticipates that sometime over the four-day Thanksgiving
weekend, American will top its previous one-day record of more than
30,000 passengers flown out of O'Hare.
   ``Passengers ought to look forward to having some delays,'' both
in the air and on the ground, he said, adding that Sunday may be
worst of all. ``People can choose a variety of days to begin
vacation, but pretty much they wind up returning on that Sunday.''
   Assuming clear skies, the airlines said travelers should find the
delays manageable, but if the weather declines to cooperate,
everything is up for grabs.
   ``Sixty percent of your delays are related to weather,'' said FAA
spokesman Mort Edelstein in Chicago.
   The new FAA limitations were imposed after the number of
controller errors reached 30, far exceeding the 12 reported at
O'Hare in all of 1987. Four of the errors occurred over a period of
a week, Edelstein said.
   Even with the new limits, ``there's no perfect flow control,''
Edelstein said. ``Some hours we'll take 82 (arrivals per hour). We
are liberal with the 80 an hour when it has to be.''
   Some feel the cutbacks don't go far enough.
   ``The airlines schedule so many fights at certain times in and
out ... that the airport can't handle them,'' said David Shuler, a
controller at O'Hare and a representative of the National Air
Traffic Control Association. ``There's only so many taxiways the
aircraft can be on.''
   Shuler said the long-term solution is 30 more controllers at
O'Hare.
   The short-term answer for travelers?
   ``Avoid key peak times and don't put off travel plans till the

   The Supreme Court has sentenced a man to be shot by
firing squad for leading a mob that killed seven people in ethnic
riots this year, a witness said Saturday.
   Kuryun Naganpetyan, a Moscow-based Armenian activist and painter,
said the verdict against Akhmed I. Akhmedov from the republic of
Azerbaijan was handed down shortly after 6 p.m. Friday.
   It was the first death penalty issued by Soviet courts in
connection with the Feb. 28 riots in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait.
   Soviet officials say 32 people, including 26 Armenians, were
killed in the unrest. Armenians have set the toll much higher.
   In May, an Azerbaijani metalworker, Talekh Salekh Ogli Ismailov,
was found guilty by a court in Azerbaijan of committing premeditated
murder in Sumgait and given a 15-year prison sentence.
   State-run media in Moscow did not immediately report the verdict
in the Akhmedov trial, which was closed to Western journalists.
Naganpetyan, who has attended the trial daily, reported the court's
decision in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   The riots in Sumgait were sparked by a campaign by Armenians, who
are mostly Christian, to annex the predominantly Armenian region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been part of largely Moslem Azerbaijan
since 1923.
   More than 80 people have been charged with criminal offenses in
the anti-Armenian unrest that broke out in Sumgait, an industrial
city on the Caspian Sea about 20 miles north of Azerbaijan's
capital, Baku.
   Akhmedov and two co-defendants, Ilgam A. Ismailov and Yavar G.
Dzhafarov, went on trial at the Supreme Court on murder and arson
charges Oct. 18. Tass, the official news agency, said the three were
charged with ``organizing and taking a direct part in mass disorders
accompanied by pogroms, acts of arson and murders.''
   Naganpetyan said Akhmedov was convicted of using a megaphone to
shout to a mob ``Kill the Armenians!'' and of leading them as they
stormed 17 apartments in Sumgait and killed seven people, burning
some of them alive.
   Armenian newspapers, whose reporters have been allowed into the
trial, have said that according to testimony, bands of Azerbaijanis
in Sumgait hunted down and killed Armenians, and that one man was
hurled alive into a bonfire.
   One young girl was mutilated with a shovel and burned alive,
according to accounts of the Supreme Court trial that have appeared
in the Armenian press.
   The guilty verdict and death sentence came as a shock to
Akhmedov, Naganpetyan said.
   ``Visibly, he didn't expect to be found guilty. His face
dissolved when he was told he would be shot, and he turned away,''
Naganpetyan said. ``It was a great contrast to the first part of the
day, when he behaved like a hero.''
   The Armenian activist said the Supreme Court did not announce
when Akhmedov would be executed. He said the trial of Akhmedov's
co-defendants, Ismailov and Dzhafarov, is continuing.
   Other trials of suspects charged in the Sumgait riots have been
held, but official media have not reported on them. Even Armenia's
Communist Party chief, Suren Arutyunyan, has complained about the
way the cases are being handled.
   ``We see how the obviously delayed investigation reopened old
wounds, how people are shaken by the fact that the legal examination
is being conducted in various cities of the country, and that no
information is coming into the republic about who was punished, what
the sentence was,'' Arutyunyan said in an Oct. 8 speech carried on
Armenian television.
   Under the Soviet criminal code, the death penalty can be applied
for offenses ranging from murder to war crimes and large-scale
economic crimes against the state, such as embezzlement of
government property or taking bribes.
   Nazi war criminal Feodor Federenko was executed on July 27, 1987.

<TEXT>
   Anti-Marxist guerrillas and Cuban forces in
Angola are holding peace talks and have informally agreed not to
attack each other while they await results of a regional peace plan,
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said.
   Savimbi, head of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, or UNITA, told reporters at his bush headquarters Friday his
group met representatives of Cuban President Fidel Castro on Aug. 26.
   At the meeting, which was called to turn over two of 17 Cuban
officers captured by UNITA during fighting with Angola's Cuban- and
Soviet-backed government, Savimbi said delegates arranged ``a tacit
understanding that if we don't harass them, they won't attack us.''
   Savimbi said Castro asked for another meeting to discuss a system
of communications by which the U.S.- and South African-backed UNITA
will know if Cubans are part of a government convoy and can avoid
attacking them.
   He said Cubans have not attacked his forces ``for some time'' but
claimed Soviet personnel had engaged in fighting.
   ``The Cubans are staying behind. They are not playing a major
role. They are not visible,'' Savimbi said.
   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, Savimbi said he
has agreed to a U.S. proposal to provide food to civilians on the
government side of the Angolan civil war. He said his only condition
was that Americans be allowed into northern Angola to make sure the
food goes to civilians and not government soldiers.
   The guerrilla leader said President-elect George Bush had
promised him before and after the U.S. election that U.S. support to
UNITA would continue until the Soviets stop supplying the Angolan
government and 50,000 Cuban troops leave the nation.
   At the news conference, Savimbi said South African President P.W.
Botha had invited him to a meeting in Pretoria on Wednesday to
discuss a U.S.-mediated peace plan designed to get Cuban troops out
of Angola and end South African rule over South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia.
   On Friday, the Angolan and Cuban governments formally approved
the tentative peace accord. South Africa's Cabinet is expected to
discuss the matter in a few days.
   Negotiators from Angola, Cuba and South Africa, under U.S.
mediation, agreed Tuesday in Geneva to submit a timetable to their
respective governments for the redeployment to the north of the
country and ultimate pullout of the Cuban troops. South Africa says
agreement on a Cuban withdrawal is a precondition for allowing
independence for Namibia.
   Savimbi said he did not care how long the Cubans take to leave,
as long as they all go. He is confident that without Cuban support
the Marxist Angolan forces would have no choice but to negotiate
with him on a reconciliation government leading to free elections,
which he believes he would win.
   The guerrilla leader said that, unlike anti-government rebels in
Afghanistan who have attacked the retreating Soviet army, his rebels
would leave departing Cuban troops alone. ``The best victory is to
allow the enemy to go,'' he said.
   UNITA has been fighting for a share of power since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The group's intelligence chief, Gen. Peregrino Wambo, said that
in the past month 48 UNITA soldiers had died, while the Angolan
government has lost 531 men and the Cubans 12.

   Soldiers raided or clamped curfews on at least
nine Arab communities in the occupied lands Saturday to search for
anti-Israeli activists, and 14 Palestinians were shot during
clashes, Arab reports said.
   Twelve Palestinians were treated for beating injuries after
soldiers confronted stone-throwing protesters in the West Bank city
of Nablus, the reports said.
   The army reported a total of 12 wounded.
   Palestinian businesses and public transportation were paralyzed
by a general strike marking the anniversary of the death of a
founder of the Palestinian resistance movement.
   The strike in honor of Sheikh Ezzedine Al Kassem, fatally shot in
1935 by British rulers in the northern city of Haifa, was called by
pro-PLO underground leaders of the uprising. It was endorsed by the
Moslem fundamentalist ``Hamas,'' or ``Zeal,'' movement.
   In a new leaflet, pro-PLO leaders urged more celebrations and
three days of general strikes between Nov. 21 and Dec. 6 marking
Palestinian statehood that was proclaimed Tuesday in Algiers.
   The leaflet, which was read by telephone to The Associated Press,
also called for seven days of ``escalating the struggle'' against
Israel.
   The document referred to the newly declared state as ``the
Palestinian wedding.'
   Streets were deserted in major West Bank cities and throughout
the Gaza Strip, but confrontations were reported in outlying
neighborhoods of Gaza City, in refugee camps and near the West
Bank's largest city, Nablus.
   Palestinians attacked soldiers with rocks in four villages near
Nablus where the troops came in jeeps to conduct searches and
arrests, Arab news reports said.
   The soldiers responded by opening fire, wounding 10 Arabs, said
officials at Al Ittihad and St. John's hospitals in Nablus.
   Among the wounded was a 65-year-old woman from the village of
Karawa Beni Hassan, who was hit in the chest, and a 20-year-old man
from the village of Beit Furik, who was seriously wounded in the
chest, the officials said.
   During raids in Beit Furik and the village of Beit Imrin,
soldiers patrolling in jeeps ordered residents to take down PLO
flags and wipe nationalist slogans off walls, Arab news reports said.
   In another village, Ailar, troops gathered men aged 12 to 50 at a
local school and detained three, the reports said.
   Soldiers also fired live ammunition and tear gas to disperse
nationalist demonstrators in Nablus, an Arab reporter said.
   At least two of the protesters and three other Palestinians at
the scene were detained, the reporter said.
   One of those detained, a 20-year-old Arab, was later admitted to
Al Ittihad Hospital with injuries from beatings on his face, back
and head, a hospital official said.
   Eleven other Palestinians also were treated at a local clinic and
at Al Ittihad for beating injuries, the hospital official and the
Arab reporter said.
   In Gaza, troops shot and wounded four Palestinians during clashes
in the El Bureij refugee camp and Gaza City, an official at Ahli
Arab Hospital said.
   An Arab witness said troops ordered residents in the city's Sabra
quarter to erase graffiti supporting the general strike, threatening
a $10,000 fine to any homeowner who refused.
   Soldiers clamped curfews on five refugee camps in Gaza and
restricted entry and exit in the Nablus area, the army said.
   Saturday's violence capped a week of unrest touched off by the
Palestine National Council's four-day meeting in Algiers, which
began Saturday and culminated in the declaration of an independent
Palestinian state.
   The proclamation follows an 11-month uprising by Palestinians
against Israeli rule in the occupied lands. The uprising has killed
313 Arabs and 11 Israelis.

   Romania on Saturday gave a high-ranking
Hungarian diplomat three days to leave the country for what it said
were ``anti-Romanian, anti-socialist and provocative actions.''
   The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Karoly
Gyorfi, a commercial counselor at the Hungarian Embassy in
Bucharest, had been detained for six hours by Romanian police and
accused of distributing ``inciting leaflets.''
   It did not specify what was contained in the leaflets.
   ``Considering the anti-Romanian, anti-socialist and provocative
actions of the Hungarian diplomat ... Romania communicated to
(Hungary) ... that Karoly Gyorfi was declared persona non grata and
he had to leave Romania's territory within three days,'' the
Romanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the
official Romanian news agency Agerpres.
   The Ministry said Gyorfi's ``very grave actions (were)
incompatible with the diplomatic status.'' It did not elaborate.
   The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said the Romanian accusations were
``completely unfounded'' and charged Bucharest with ``a serious
provocation.''
   The expulsion likely was to aggravate tense relations between the
neigboring communist countries.
   Last summer, Romania closed the Hungarian consulate in the city
of Cluj-Napoca after demonstrations in the Hungarian capital of
Budapest by about 50,000 people protesting a Romanian plan to raze
thousands of predominantly Hungarian villages in Romania.
   Hungarians have repeatedly expressed concern for the welfare of
the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania, who they claim suffer
discrimination.

   A surface-to-air missile hit a plane
carrying the defense minister and several senior army commanders,
but the aircraft landed safely, an official statement said Saturday.
   The incident occurred Thursday just after the Hercules C-130 took
off from Wau in southern Sudan's Bahr el-Ghazal region, said the
statement released by the Sudanese Armed Forces Command.
   In addition to Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil, the plane
carried Gen. Fathi Ahmed Ali, commander-in-chief of the Sudanese
armed forces, and commanders of major military units, the statement
said.
   It said the SAM-7 missile badly damaged the plane's engine and
the control system. The pilot managed to maintain control and landed
the plane without injury or other damage, the statement said.
   The statement did not accuse the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army of firing the missile. The missile was of the type used by both
the southern rebels and the Sudanese army.
   Khalil and his officers were reportedly on an inspection tour at
Wau, 630 miles southwest of Khartoum. The town, which has a major
army garrison, has been under siege by the rebels for months and
also has been the scene of civil unrest.
   The incident came a day after an initial cease-fire agreement was
signed in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa between rebel leader
John Garang and a delegation from the second-largest partner in
Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's coalition cabinet.
   The agreement won el-Mahdi's support and that of other political
leaders. It has yet to be officially approved by the entire cabinet.
   Khalil and his companions returned to Khartoum on Saturday in a
plane sent to Wau to pick them up.

   Communist East Germany has banned distribution of a
Soviet monthly, saying the popular publication contained articles
that ``distorted history,'' official media said Saturday.
   The Communist Party organ Neues Deutschland said in a terse
announcement that the Postal Ministry had indefinitely suspended
delivery of Sputnik, a periodical that contains selected articles
from the Soviet press and is targeted for readers outside the Soviet
Union.
   Neues Deutschland said the magazine did ``not contribute to
cementing Soviet-East German relations and instead contained
articles that distort history.''
   In recent issues, Sputnik has carried articles containing frank
appraisals of the Stalin era, along with letters and commentaries
critical of government policies.
   East German leaders have resisted Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies of glasnost, or openness, saying they are not
necessary in East Germany.
   Gorbachev enjoys enormous popularity among ordinary East Germans,
who hope the Soviet leader's influence will bring about similar
reforms in their own country.
   In recent months, East German authorities have cracked down on
the nation's Lutheran Church press, censoring or banning
publications dealing with human rights issues.
   The Soviet Embassy in East Berlin refused comment on the
suspension of Sputnik.

   Contract talks have broken off between the Chicago
Sun-Times and the Chicago Newspaper Guild, and the union said its
members will strike Monday if the newspaper does not offer them a
raise.
   Negotiations broke off Friday. The newspaper plans to continue
publishing if there is a strike. The guild's previous contract with
the Sun-Times expired June 1.
   Negotiators for the newspaper proposed that the next meeting take
place Monday morning, but the union wanted weekend meetings and had
not decided whether to accept, guild spokesman Charles Nicodemus
said Saturday.
   ``Some significant progress had been made during the week, but
the guild refused to meet again Monday,'' said Michael Soll,
Sun-Times spokesman. He said management had told the union several
weeks ago that no talks could be held this weekend because of prior
commitments.
   The union _ which represents 250 Sun-Times reporters, editors,
photographers and support staff _ had not set a specific time for a
strike.
   ``We only said Monday,'' guild spokesman Thomas Gibbons said
Friday. ``We will set the time, probably on Sunday.''
   ``The company is still seeking pay cuts, (night) differential
cuts and eight exemptions'' from union jurisdiction, said Gibbons.
``We are a long way from settlement and there has to be a pay
raise.''
   The newspaper originally asked guild members to take a 15 percent
pay cut, Gibbons said.
   By Friday, he said the Sun-Times was seeking a 3 percent salary
cut for 18 months of a three-year pact, followed by restoration of
current pay levels.
   Management also wanted to trim the differential paid for working
night and early-morning shifts from 10 percent to 6 percent, he said.
   Soll said he was ``not at liberty to discuss any details.''
   He said the company had filed an unfair labor-practice charge
against the guild with the National Labor Relations Board, and said
the allegation was under investigation. The complaint concerned
aspects of the union's conduct last week, said Soll, who would not
elaborate.
   Some guild members were angered by a letter sent out by the
Sun-Times last week, reminding them of the 1985 Tribune strike and
saying that ``many of the Tribune's former employees will never work
there again. We don't want those kinds of problems for the
Sun-Times.''
   Religion writer Daniel Lehmann said the letter was ``an obvious
threat'' of job loss.
   Soll said the letter was intended only to remind employees of the
seriousness of the situation.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet on Saturday
warned opposition leaders to stop pushing for constitutional reforms
and threatened to void the results of a referendum requiring him to
hold open elections, a government news agency said.
   In a dispatch from the southern city of Coiyhaique, the agency
Orbe quoted Pinochet as saying opposition leaders had failed to heed
his calls that they abide by the constitution his military
government drafted in 1980.
   ``I have asked them if they accept the constitution, but they
remain silent,'' he was quoted as saying. ``If they say `no,' the
plebescite is null.''
   The statement, made at a breakfast meeting with women supporters
in Coiyhaique, was intended to elaborate on a comment by Pinochet on
Friday that the opposition would ``have to live with the
consequences'' if they failed to respect the constitution, Orbe said.
   In the Oct. 5 ballot, voters rejected a proposal by Pinochet and
other military commanders that he remain in office until 1997. As a
result, according to the provisions of the constitution, he must
call open elections, planned for December 1989, and hand over power
to the winner in March 1990.
   Leaders of a 15-party opposition coalition, which led the
campaign for Pinochet's defeat at the polls, have called for several
amendments to the constitution.
   They object to provisions that would allow the president to
appoint nearly one-third of the senate, and which give the military
a majority of seats on an influential national security council.
They also object to an article that prohibits all propagation of
Marxist philosophy.
   They say the constitutional reforms are needed to assure full
democratic powers for the new elected government.
   Pinochet has firmly rejected the proposed reforms. The fiercely
anti-communist army commander, who will be 73 next week, seized
power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of a
Marxist president, Salvador Allende, during a period of economic and
social upheaval.
   Saturday's comments came at the end of a four-day tour of Chile's
far south. Coiyhaique is about 950 miles south of Santiago, the
nation's capital.
   In the breakfast meeting, Pinochet also said the referendum's
outcome was ``not a triumph'' for the opposition, because he managed
to win ``more than 3 million votes after 15 years of government.''
   According to Orbe, he said the vote left him ``like a
much-punched boxer, but it (the effects) passed quickly, I've
recuperated.''
   He told supporters that in the upcoming elections, ``you have to
act aggressively, but in the best sense of the word, which is to say
with initiative,'' to assure victory for conservative forces.
   In the elections, voters are to choose not only a president but a
civilian congress. The legislature was disbanded and replaced by a
military junta when Pinochet seized power.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen have
joined the chorus of Democratic Party leaders urging Paul G. Kirk
Jr. to serve another term as party chairman, and Kirk on Saturday
disavowed any role in thwarting Jesse Jackson's political ambitions.
   Kirk told reporters that Jackson's potential influence on the
selection of a new party chairman ``will play no role in my
decision'' whether to seek another term, which he said Dukakis and
Bentsen urged him to do.
   Kirk said he told Jackson in a telephone conversation Friday that
he hadn't made up his mind. Jackson responded, ``let's stay in touch
because that will be important whatever you decide,'' Kirk said.
   Kirk disclosed his conversations with Dukakis and Bentsen, the
party's defeated 1988 national ticket, during a meeting of the
Association of State Democratic Chairs.
   The state party leaders were eager to proclaim the party alive
and well after its latest presidential election defeat less than two
weeks ago to Republican George Bush.
   But they also heard a warning from former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt that they must stop treating campaigns for the White House
like ``an extension of a congressional campaign'' and start offering
a larger vision of the future.
   ``We assume that what elects a senator will elect a president,
that what wins the statehouse will win the White House,'' said
Babbitt, whose bid for the Democratic presidential nomination ended
after the New Hampshire primary.
   He said the Democrats' success in electing members of Congress
and governors ``makes it even harder to swallow that, once again,
the biggest prize, the presidency, has eluded our grasp.''
   He said that voters regard the presidency as ``about the larger
issues of personal leadership and national destiny. ... To become a
presidential party we must have a vision of what America can become
and the credibility to be heard.''
   As an example, he cited a phrase often used by Dukakis.
   ``Good jobs for good wages may be a good slogan, but it is not a
policy, much less a program,'' said Babbitt.
   He said the Democrats must offer voters an economic message of
``growth and renewal _ not just equity and redistribution'' and a
foreign and defense policy that acknowledges that ``in an imperfect
world we must sometimes project and use force.''
   Kirk's term as party chairman expires in February and he had
indicated he had no desire to serve another four years.
   But many party leaders, apparently eager to avoid a potentially
divisive battle for the post, have pleaded with him to stay on.
   Asked if that included the two men on the national ticket, Kirk
said, ``Senator Bentsen did and Governor Dukakis asked me what I was
thinking about, and I told him it was a serious and major decision,
different from the course I had set out on. ... He said I hope you
stay on.''
   Jackson was not among those urging Kirk to seek a another term.
   The pressure on Kirk was perceived as a strategy for blocking
Jackson from increasing his influence within the national party
structure.
   Kirk said that if he decides to seek another term it would only
be ``to try to do a better job'' and not to ``prevent any conflict
or be an obstacle in any other person's way.''
   He said that if any of his backers were trying to block Jackson
``they haven't mentioned it to me.''
   Ron Brown, a Washington lawyer who played a key role in the late
stage of the Jackson presidential campaign, was the only potential
candidate for party chairman who refused to commit himself to
dropping out of the race if Kirk decides to run.
   ``I don't feel obligated to say I'm not going to take another
breath until he decides what to do,'' said Brown, who emphasized
that he and Kirk had worked closely together in the past.
   If Kirk runs for another term, Brown said, ``obviously it makes
it more difficult, obviously it makes it less likely,'' that Brown
would enter the race.
   He said it was ``a very unfair characterization'' to describe him
as Jackson's man in the contest. ``I would suggest the next chairman
of the party had better have a good relationship with Jesse because
he's going to be around for a long time,'' Brown added.
   Party leaders from the Northeastern states backed Kirk's
re-election as ``the mechanic, the generalist, the builder and
spokesperson this party needs,'' said Samuel Shipley, their chairman.

   Appalachian children scrambled over rocks
and oily railroad crossties Saturday to claim some of the 12 tons of
gifts and candy tossed from a train during the 46th annual run of
the ``Santa Claus Special.''
   ``Christmas begins this way for us every year, no doubt about
it,'' said Lloyd D. Lewis, spokesman for CSX Transportation Co.,
which supplied the train.
   As in past years, Santa Claus was seated on the rear platform,
tossing gifts as the train slowly passed crowds of children along
the route through the coalfields of parts of Kentucky and Virginia
into Tennessee.
   ``I have people tell me they came as a child and now are bringing
their grandchildren,'' said Frank Brogden, who has played Santa for
the past four years. ``It's a great tradition.''
   CSX Transportation and Kingsport, Tenn., business officials put a
trailer-load of presents aboard the train before it pulled out of
Kingsport on Friday afternoon to get into position for the run.
   The four-car train left the Shelbiana train yard in eastern
Kentucky shortly after sunrise, loaded down with donated candy and
gifts, including 3,000 digital watches, 50,000 cassette tapes of
children's stories, 5,000 toy cars, 10,000 comic books and 3,000
Frisbees.
   The Santa train's route takes it from Shelbiana through 30
communities in eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia before
arriving in Kingsport, Tenn., for a Christmas parade Saturday
afternoon.
   The train takes 7{ hours to pass through 110 miles of remote
gorges and valleys, rumbling through 32 tunnels on a rail line
normally used by the huge ``unit trains'' that bring coal down from
the mountains.
   ``For 110 miles, there's not a stretch of this railroad where
you're not looking at a kid,'' Lewis said.
   Georgia Farrand of East Carters Valley, Va., brought her grandson
to see the train when it stopped in St. Paul, Va. She said the train
has become an important Christmas tradition for Appalachian
youngsters.
   ``Children get a lot of joy out of it and they really look
forward to it from year to year,'' she said.
   Santa has been bringing the early Christmas presents to
Appalachian children since 1943, when the line between Shelbiana and
Kingsport was part of the Clinchfield Railroad, Lewis said.
   It started that year with a small group of Kingsport Merchants
Bureau members riding on a car at the rear of a regularly scheduled
passenger train from Elkhorn City, Ky., to Kingsport, he said.
   Passenger service was discontinued in 1954 and from then until
1967, Santa and his helpers rode passenger cars attached to freight
trains. Since 1968, Santa Claus has had his own special train, Lewis
said.
   The train makes brief stops in Elkhorn City, Ky.; Freemont, Va.;
Dante Station, Va.; St. Paul, Va.; Dungannon, Va.; Speers Ferry,
Va., and Waycross, Va., before arriving in Kingsport on the
Tennessee-Virginia state line.

   President Reagan has signed legislation
approving a complex deal between a Florida man and the federal
government in which some 107,800 acres of Florida swampland will be
swapped for a valuable piece of downtown Phoenix, Ariz.
   The White House announced that Reagan signed the legislation on
Friday. Congress approved the deal in October.
   The bill authorizes the Interior Department to dispose of the
104-acre tract of Arizona land known as the Phoenix Indian School,
which the Reagan administration wants to close because of declining
enrollments.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative wing of
Congress, has described the downtown Phoenix land as perhaps the
most valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the West.
   Critics have charged that the government could have sold the
Arizona land on the open market and earned tens of millions dollars
more for the taxpayers, while the Florida land is protected by law
against development, anyway.
   Under the plan, Barron Collier and the Collier family interests
of Florida will get 68.4 acres of the Phoenix property in exchange
for the Florida acreage and a cash payment of at least $34.9 million.
   The transaction also calls for the Veterans Administration to get
11.5 acres of the school property to expand its Phoenix hospital;
Phoenix to get 20 acres for a park; and Arizona to get 4.5 acres for
a veterans home. The rest of the land is tied up in road
rights-of-way.
   The money paid by the Colliers will be placed into a trust fund
for the education of Indians in Arizona.
   The Florida land will be used to provide a buffer around the
Everglades and to provide habitat for endangered species, such as
the Florida panther.
   The House voted 316-32 approval of a package of bills in which
the Phoenix deal was included. The Senate gave final approval in
late October.
   The Florida property is in Collier County in Southwest Florida.
The bulk of the 108,000 acres lies immediately north of the Big
Cypress National Preserve, which borders Everglades National Park on
the park's northwest side.
   Another parcel of 5,000 acres is adjacent to the Fakahatchee
Strand State Preserve, known home to about a fifth of the 30 to 50
Florida panthers believed left in the wilderness. The state preserve
is west of the national preserve.
   Another 19,620 acres is next to the state's Cape Romano-Ten
Thousand Islands Aquatic Preserve, on the Gulf Coast south of Naples
and west of Everglades City.
   At the time the House granted its approval, Reps. Sidney Yates,
D-Ill., chairman of the Appropriations interior subcommitee, and
George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the Interior water and power
resources subcommittee, sharply criticized the deal.
   Yates and Miller argued that taxpayers would get a better deal if
the property were sold on the open market, contending at least one
appraiser found the Phoenix land to be worth $100 million more than
that attached to it in the exchange.
   The legislation was sponsored principally by Interior Committee
Chairman Morris Udall, D-Ariz.
   ``This is a cushy, cozy deal for the Colliers,'' said Yates. ``If
it were not Mo Udall's bill, it would be laughed off the floor.''
   Miller argued that while the Florida land is environmentally
sensitive and a good federal acquisition, it already is protected
from any damaging development by federal law.

<HEAD>Bhutto Seeks New Gains in Provincial Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Populist leader Benazir Bhutto sought
to add to her victory in a national election with more gains
Saturday in provincial voting.
   Pakistanis voted for 483 seats in the assemblies of Punjab, Sind,
Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier three days after they gave
Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party a plurality in the National
Assembly.
   Results of provincial voting were not expected until Sunday.
   The party led by U.S.-educated Ms. Butto, 35, won 92 National
Assembly seats, compared with 55 for her conservative rivals in the
Islamic Democratic Alliance. The remaining 68 seats at stake
Wednesday went to independents, minor parties and non-Moslem
candidates.
   Ms. Bhutto announced Friday she had been assured enough support
from outside her party to command more than half the Assembly seats
and form a government. She would be the first woman to lead an
Islamic country.
   There were very few reports of violence in Saturday's polling,
even though officials had braced for incidents in the nation's first
free elections since 1977.
   ``It was very peaceful. There were some scuffles at one or two
places, but that's almost to be expected,'' said Humayun Khan,
election commission spokesman, at the close of polls Saturday.
   Military strongman Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq led Pakistan for 11
years until Aug. 17, when he died in a plane crash. Zia ousted Ms.
Bhutto's father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a
1977 coup. Bhutto was executed in 1979.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan must give the mandate for forming a
new government. But he has no deadline and has not said when he will
do so.

   An accountant in the middle of a bitter
divorce has been accused of offering his Rolls-Royce as payment for
the murder of his wife during a meeting with a detective posing as a
hired gun.
   David Stephen Leider, 48, of Indian Rocks Beach, was in jail
Saturday under $1 million bond. He was charged Thursday with
solicitation to commit murder.
   ``A payment of $50,000 was discussed,'' the St. Petersburg police
detective said in the arrest warrant. ``As an alternative to such
payment, Leider offered to sell a $100,000 Rolls to (me) for
$25,000.''
   Leider refused to discuss the details and ``preferred to refer to
the situation as `investment advice,''' said the detective, whose
name was withheld because he works undercover.
   Leider has been involved in a divorce dispute with his wife, Dr.
Zena Leider, a Largo proctologist, since March 1987.

   Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined
more than 2,000 people who gathered Saturday to mark the 125th
anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address
honoring the men who fought here in the Civil War.
   Rehnquist noted that although Lincoln's speech endures, it was
not the focus of the Nov. 19, 1863, dedication of part of the
Gettysburg battlefield as a national cemetery.
   ``Edward Everett, the nationally known orator, was the featured
speaker, and spoke for nearly two hours,'' Rehnquist said. ``Lincoln
was invited only to make a few remarks. Yet Everett's oration is
forgotten, but Lincoln's remarks will live forever.''
   People in period dress lined the streets near the town's train
depot, awaiting the arrival of a man portraying Lincoln and his
entourage on the Stroudsburg Railroad.
   As the dignitaries climbed off the train more than 2,000 people
dressed as Civil War troops and townspeople of the era kicked off
the celebration, making a parade to the National Cemetery where
Lincoln gave the famed speech.
   State police estimated more than 5,000 spectators huddled in the
freezing rain to hear James A. Getty, portraying Lincoln, repeat the
270-word speech that begins, ``Four score and seven years ago ....''
   ``You knew he was an actor, but it was still thrilling,'' said
Sunbury resident Jean Marquette, who was not bothered by the bad
weather. ``I got goose bumps.''
   Rehnquist spoke of Lincoln as a great statesman and masterful
speech writer.
   ``From contemporary descriptions of Lincoln, he was not what one
would think of as a great speaker,'' Rehnquist said. ``His voice was
high-pitched, and his tall, lanky appearance gave an impression of
awkwardness. But Abraham Lincoln was a master of the English
language.
   ``He was not just articulate; he was able to convey ideas in
simple terms, and yet with force and sometimes passion,'' Rehnquist
said.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain From Texas To W.Va.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain fell Saturday from Texas across the Mississippi River
into the Ohio Valley, causing some flooding, and snow fell across
the northern Plains and the southern Plains.
   Flash flood watches were issued for parts of northeastern Texas,
the Missouri Bootheel, western and central Kentucky, western
Tennessee, and southwestern into northeastern Arkansas.
   Central Arkansas got the heaviest rain, with up to 9 inches at
Little Rock from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon, and 6 inches
fell in parts of central and northeastern Arkansas.
   The Saline River at Benton, Ark., just southwest of Little Rock,
was 2 feet above flood stage during the morning, a rise of 16 feet
in 24 hours. The river was expected to crest at 8 feet above flood
stage.
   Parts of western Tennessee got 3 to 4 inches of rain during the
night and many small streams and drainage ditches were full or
overflowing. Dyersburg got 2.5 inches.
   Western Kentucky got 3 to 5 inches overnight with 2 to 3 inches
over the central part of the state.
   In southeastern Missouri, Caruthersville got 5.48 inches of rain
overnight, and more than 2 inches fell from West Plains into Cape
Girardeau.
   Locally heavy rain was reported with thunderstorms from
northeastern Texas into parts of central Mississippi, and Avery,
Texas, got 2.51 inches of rain overnight. Thunderstorms produced
afternoon wind gusts to 70 mph near Gilmer, uprooting trees.
   Street flooding was reported near Summit, Miss., in Pike County,
and 2 to 4 inches of rain was measured during the morning at
Jackson, Miss.
   In the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 1.85 inches fell at Memphis,
Tenn.; 1.42 inches at Columbus, Miss.; and 1.06 inches at
Charleston, W.Va.
   Snow fell from east-central New Mexico into northwestern
Oklahoma, and a mixture of snow and sleet was reported over parts of
central Kansas. Two inches of snow accumulated at Gage, Okla., with
an inch reported at Albuquerque and Clovis, N.M.
   That snow was expected to move farther out onto the Plains and a
winter storm warning was posted for the Texas Panhandle, with storm
watches out into parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri.
   Snow also fell across the northern Plains to the Great Lakes,
from the eastern Dakotas into Minnesota and parts of Upper Michigan.
Duluth, Minn., got 2 inches of snow, for a total of 7 inches on the
ground.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered into the mid Atlantic states, with
sleet icing roads over parts of Maryland.
   Showers invaded the northern Pacific Coast region and snow was
expected in the Cascades of Washington state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Fargo, N.D., to 91 at McAllen, Texas. Saturday morning's
official low was 6 degrees below zero at Gallup, N.M.
   For Sunday, heavy snow was forecast across south-central and much
of eastern Kansas into northern Missouri. Rain was forecast from the
middle Mississippi Valley through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys,
the lower Great Lakes and the mid Atlantic region into New England.
Showers and thunderstorms, some possibly severe, were forecast from
the Tennessee Valley into the central Gulf Coast. Widespread showers
were forecast across the Pacific Northwest and along the northern
Pacific Coast.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted over the northern Plains; in the
30s from the northern high Plains through the middle and lower
Missouri Valley and central Kansas into the upper Mississippi Valley
and upper Great Lakes; in the 60s across southern California and the
desert Southwest, except 70s for southwestern Arizona and the Los
Angeles basin; in the 60s and 70s from southern Texas through the
central Gulf Coast region, the Tennessee Valley and the central
Appalachians into the mid Atlantic Coast; in the 80s across the
southern Atlantic Coast and Florida; and in the 40s or 50s across
much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Half-Dozen Bills from Final Days of 100th Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed into law a
half-dozen bills passed in the final days of the 100th Congress
including legislation calling for stiffer penalties against insider
trading and contractors who cheat the government.
   The White House announced the bill signings on Saturday, although
some took place earlier in the week.
   The bills signed by Reagan also concerned benefits to veterans
who are alcoholics, protection of federal workers from liability
lawsuits because of actions taken on the job; and approval of an
unusual land deal involving Florida and Arizona.
   The law on insider trading was designed to counter the wave of
scandal that rocked Wall Street several years ago and shook the
confidence of the nation's investors.
   The measure doubles the maximum criminal penalties for insider
trading from five years in jail to 10 years, and boosts fines from
$500,000 to $2.5 million for a company and from $100,000 to $1
million for an individual.
   It also holds companies liable to fines for the actions of their
employees if the firms ``knowingly or recklessly'' fail to detect
and prevent insider trading.
   Here is a summary of other bills that became law:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Contractor Penalties</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The measure makes major government procurement fraud a federal
crime and imposes tough, new penalties against contractors who have
cheated the government. It is aimed at giving prosecutors new powers
to deal especially with fraud involving Pentagon contracting.
   The Defense Department has estimated that procurement fraud cost
taxpayers $99.1 million in fiscal years 1986 and 1987.
   Under the new law, those convicted of major fraud in government
purchasing could be given prison sentences of up to 10 years and
fined up to $10 million.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Veterans</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The law overrides a Supreme Court decision that had allowed the
Veterans Administration to deny benefits to veterans who were
alcoholics because it considered alcoholism a product of ``willful
misconduct''
   Under the new law, the VA, when considering the granting of
benefits, is compelled to consider chronic alcoholism a disease as
has been generally accepted in the medical community.
   Last April the Supreme Court, denying a claim from two veterans
that they had unlawfully been denied benefits, concluded that the VA
was not compelled to consider chronic alcoholism a disease.
   Reagan also signed legislation providing a 4.1 percent
cost-of-living increase in the compensation paid to nearly 2.2
million veterans with service-connected disabilities, and to about
323,000 surviving spouses and dependents of veterans who died of
service-related causes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Workers-Liability</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The law restores immunity to federal employees so they cannot be
sued for personal liability because of their actions on the job.
   A Supreme Court decision last January had the effect of narrowing
the immunity for such workers, but the new law restores the
traditional protection for workers which had been established
previously by various court decisions.
   The new law does not apply to lawsuits seeking damages from
government workers for alleged violations of constitutional rights.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Land Swap</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The law clears the way for a complex deal between a Florida man
and the federal government in which some 107,800 acres of Florida
swampland will be traded for a valuable piece of downtown government
property in Phoenix, Ariz.
   The bill authorizes the Interior Department to dispose of the
104-acre tract of Arizona land known as the Phoenix Indian School,
which the Reagan administration wants to close because of declining
enrollments.
   In turn, the government will get the Florida land, which will
provide an added buffer near the Everglades National Park and other
federal and state lands. The government also will receive $34.9
million, which will be used for an educational trust fund for
Arizona Indians.
   The Veterans Administration, the city of Phoenix and the state of
Arizona also will get part of the Phoenix school property to be used
for various purposes.

   One of several Sri Lankan masks purchased for
the University of Pennsylvania's archaeology museum in 1893 has been
stolen, prompting school officials to close the museum.
   A mask similar to the missing one was valued recently at $400.
The mask was part of a collection of objects of minor value
displayed so they could be handled by people with visual impairments.
   On Nov. 11, the world's second-largest crystal ball, valued at
$200,000, and a 2,000-year-old bronze statuette, valued at $15,000,
also were stolen.
   Museum Director Robert H. Dyson said Saturday the museum will
reopen Tuesday.
   ``We're just trying to complete the security system,'' he said,
referring to what he said are electronic improvements.
   In August 1981, the museum closed for about three weeks to
implement security measures following three separate thefts of
artifacts.

<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers tried in a second day
of private talks Saturday to break a deadlock between Iran and Iraq
over a new pact to bolster the falling price of crude oil.
   Officials from Louisiana, Texas, and other energy-producing U.S.
states made a pitch for the ministers to iron out their differences.
The states have been hurt by falling oil prices laid to production
increases by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   ``They've got to get Iraq back into the quota system. That's
pretty obvious,'' said Kent Hance, Texas railroad commissioner. ``If
they don't, we're facing some real problems in the producing states
in the United States.''
   Iraq is the only one of 13 OPEC members that has refused to join
the 1986 production accord because it wants a quota equal to that of
bitter enemy Iran.
   Under the current quota system, Iran has a ceiling of 2.4 million
barrels a day. It is larger than the proposed 1.5 million for Iraq
because Iran has a larger domestic oil market.
   The two countries agreed to a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war
in August. They would now like more oil revenues to help rebuild
their battered economies.
   Subroto of Indonesia, who serves as secretary-general for OPEC,
said Saturday that the ministers probably would have to check with
their governments before an agreement could be reached.
   ``We can say that lots of progress has been made in trying to
(work) out major problems that we are facing,'' he told reporters
Saturday. He added, however, ``We have to be realistic enough that
very likely we need some consultations with our governments.''
   His remarks raised the possibility the ministers might have to
return home for further instructions.
   Subroto spoke after a 40-minute meeting of two committees of the
oil group. Before the meeting, ministers from Iran and Iraq met
separately with other ministers in an attempt to reach a compromise.
   Subroto said the ministers would again meet in small groups
Sunday and report to OPEC's regularly scheduled winter meeting on
Monday. All 13 oil ministers will attend those talks.
   The dispute between Iran and Iraq is the major stumbling block to
a new arrangement that would set limits on how much oil each country
can produce daily.
   Analysts say OPEC members boosted production in an effort to
improve their negotiating position at these meetings.
   The current production accord sets total output at about 15
million barrels a day. Total OPEC production in October was
estimated by the International Energy Agency at nearly 21.1 million
barrels, the highest monthly level in more than five years.
   With soaring production, prices have tumbled sharply below OPEC's
benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   Samuel B. Nunez Jr., president of the Louisiana State Senate,
said Saturday that $15 a barrel represents a good benchmark. He
called it a ``price the industry can live with, consumers can live
with, and a price that does justice to the producing states.''
   The U.S. officials, who said they were well-received by OPEC
representatives, met with Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa Sabah and
Subroto. The officials said they would also meet with oil ministers
Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria and Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia.
   Hance said the U.S. delegation included 14 people from Louisiana,
Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska.

   A Hawaiian Airlines jumbo jet flew 368 miles off
course on a flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu and an Air National
Guard surveillance crew has been credited with saving the flight
before it ran out of fuel.
   A commendation memo to the Guard crew said it was highly likely
the L-1011 TriStar could have bypassed the Hawaiian Islands on Nov.
7 and not had enough fuel to make landfall. But the crew spotted it
in time on radar and gave warning.
   Hawaii is the most isolated landmass on Earth.
   The plane, heading west, was detected 368 miles north of Oahu
Island, where Honolulu is located, five minutes after its scheduled
arrival time at Honolulu International Airport, the National Guard
said.
   The surveillance crew determined that the plane was Hawaiian
Flight 471 and notified the Diamond Head air traffic control center,
which instructed the pilot to turn south, the National Guard said.
   Other details of the flight, such as the number of passengers and
the fuel level upon landing, were not available Saturday.
   The memo outlining the incident implied problems with the plane's
navigational instruments may have led the aircraft off course.
   ``We received a report from the FAA (Federal Aviation
Administration) that one of our planes was off course,'' Keoni
Wagner, the airline's public relations manager, said Friday. ``We
weren't aware of it because we didn't show any such incident with
our instruments. ... It didn't show any such deviation.''
   Airline officials said the case was still under investigation and
would not say if anyone had been disciplined for the flight error.
   Surveillance crews monitor Hawaiian airspace 24 hours a day, said
National Guard spokesman Maj. Richard Shimomuro.

   Two moderate earthquakes rocked northern
Utah from Salt Lake City to the Idaho border on Saturday, causing
minor damage in at least two cities, authorities said.
   The larger quake had a magnitude of 5 on the Richter scale and
occurred about 12:45 p.m. MST. It was followed 20 minutes later by a
temblor of magnitude 4.6. Both were located near the Utah-Idaho
border about three miles west of Bear Lake, said seismologist Sue
Nava of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations.
   Residents in Logan and Ogden reported minor damage, including
cracked windows and loosened masonry.
   Nava said the earthquake was the largest recorded in Utah since
Aug. 14, when a temblor of magnitude 5 was reported.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 5.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 4.5.

   Republican governors opened a four-day
national conference Saturday predicting an increased role for the
states as President-elect George Bush builds his administration.
   ``He's a real believer in governors,'' said Delaware Gov. Michael
N. Castle, chairman of the National Republican Governors Conference.
``You're going to see a different America.''
   Castle joined several other GOP chief executives for a bayside
news conference at the Grand Hotel resort at Point Clear, where the
conference is being held.
   The weekend agenda was devoted mostly to welcoming receptions and
a tour on Sunday of the U.S.S. Lexington aircraft carrier docked off
Pensacola, Fla., about an hour from this Alabama coastal resort.
   Castle said Republican governors were closely involved with
Bush's campaign in that the vice president had developed close ties
with GOP statehouses.
   ``Bush has probably met with us more in the last four years than
any other public official,'' said Castle.
   He said the new administration's relationship with Republican
chief executives was signaled when Bush scheduled a speech to the
conference Tuesday and dispatched key advisers, including chief of
staff-designate John Sununu, to take part in discussions Monday.
   The list of those planning to attend includes ``almost every
single person who is coming into power in the White House,'' said
Castle.
   Along with Sununu, those taking part in Monday's sessions include
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, incoming Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater and his predecessor, Frank Fahrenkopf, and
senior campaign adviser Bob Teeter.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, who in 1986 became the first Republican to
win his state's governorship in more than 100 years, said a
``century of the states'' is now under way.
   Hunt said President Reagan has been ``turning more power and
responsibility to the states'' and local governments are beginning
to ``stop looking to Washington for the answer to all our problems.''
   Castle said the states already have been leading the way in
pursuing innovative social welfare programs and giving new impetus
to education advances.
   ``The real activism has come from the state level,'' he said.
   The conference chairman said the GOP governors will be analyzing
where the party is and what needs to be done in the future. But he
said it is not just a partisan event.
   He said Republican governors such as Thomas Kean of New Jersey
have shown they are leaders who have the well-being of all segments
of society in mind, trying to develop programs ``that are going to
prevent problems from happening.''

   Greek shipping heiress Christina Onassis,
who died Saturday of a heart attack in Argentina, was a global
jet-setter worth an estimated $1 billion.
   The only daughter of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis,
Miss Onassis inherited his fortune _ and control of his two major
shipping companies, Springfield Shipping of New York City and
Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo, France _ after her father's death
in 1975.
   Miss Onassis, 37, led a stormy life that often captured newspaper
headlines. She was married four times and had one daughter, Athena,
named after her late mother and her father's first wife.
   Miss Onassis suffered a heart attack and died Saturday while
visiting a country club on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
where she was visiting a longtime friend, officials were quoted as
saying.
   Onassis' only other child, Alexander, died in a plane crash
earlier in 1975 before his father's death, leaving Christina as the
only heir to the family fortune, estimated at around $1 billion.
   Miss Onassis reportedly didn't get along with her step-mother,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who married her father in 1968. Mrs.
Kennedy Onassis' first husband, President John F. Kennedy, was
assassinated in 1963.
   After Onassis died in 1975, his daughter and other members of the
Onassis family reportedly offered Mrs. Kennedy Onassis a
multi-million dollar settlement to give up her rights to the Greek
magnate's estate, news reports at the time indicated.
   Ms. Onassis was stricken with a heart attack Saturday at 11 a.m.
(10 a.m. EST) at the Tortuguitas Country Club, about 30 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires, Dr. Hernan Bunge, a director of the
Clinica del Sol Hospital in the Argentine capital, was quoted as
saying.
   Miss Onassis arrived in Argentina approximately two weeks ago to
visit Marina Dodero, a long-time friend.
   She reportedly was stricken as she prepared to go swimming in a
pool at the country club home of Mrs. Dodero and her husband,
Alberto.
   Miss Onassis was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires.
   Miss Onassis also lived in Paris and St. Moritz, Switzerland. She
also owned the Greek island of Skorpios in the Ionean Sea, which she
inherited from her father. She also one time was toying with the
idea of buying the island of Corisco, located in the Atlantic Ocean
off the coast of central Africa, news reports indicated.
   She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City, and was first
married in 1971 to Los Angeles real estate broker Joseph Bolker. The
marriage ended in divorce nine months later.
   She later married Alexander Andreadis, the heir to another Greek
shipping fortune, but that marriage also ended in divorce in 1976.
   In 1978, she married a third time, in Moscow to Sergei Kauzov, a
Soviet shipping executive, but it lasted less than two years.
   In March 1984, Ms. Onassis married French businessman Thierry
Roussel in a civil service in the fashionable 7th district of Paris,
followed by a religious ceremony at a Greek Orthodox church.
   She told a French magazine at the time that she fell in love with
Roussel when she was 21 and they vacationed together on Skorpios,
the family island.
   Roussel's grandfather was the founder of a leading French
pharamaceutical company, Roussel-Uclaf, but it was sold by the
family more than 20 years ago.
   The couple had a daughter, Athena, in 1985 and she was baptized
in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on the private island of Skorpios. The
girl was immersed in a silver font specially made for the ceremony
and christened by Greek ship owner George Livanos, said news reports
at the time. The couple filed for divorce in about eight months
later.

   A Greyhound bus hit a tree and overturned
Saturday after a car swerved in front of it on rain-slickened
Interstate 65. At least 10 people were injured.
   All 45 passengers were taken to hospitals, said George Gravley,
Greyhound spokesman in Dallas. Ten were admitted, and two were
listed in critical condition.
   A pregnant woman was admitted for observation, but apparently
wasn't injured. The bus driver, Ronald W. Lightsey, 44, of
Louisville, Ky., was treated and released from Metropolitan
Nashville General Hospital.
   ``The accident occurred at 6:50 a.m. in heavy rain, on a wet
road. It happened in a construction area where three lanes merged
into two,'' Gravley said.
   ``A car swerved in front of bus and in order to avoid the car,
the bus swerved off road, went into a culvert, hit a tree and rolled
over onto its left side.''
   The bus originated in Cleveland, and planned stops in Nashville
and Birmingham, Ala., before arriving in Tallahasse, Fla. Other
passengers planned to change buses in Nashville on the way to New
Orleans.

<HEAD>Soviets Defeat England in Chess Olympiad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, aided by a brilliant
victory from world champion Garri Kasparov, on Saturday defeated
second-seeded England 3-1 in the sixth round of the Chess Olympiad
to retain their solid 2.5-point lead.
   But in the separate women's competition, Hungary kept a half
point ahead of the Soviets with a 3-0 victory over Cuba.
   In the men's Olympiad, the Soviets have 20 points out of a
possible 24. Sweden is second with 17.5 points.
   The Soviets swept into the lead in their duel with England after
just three hours when Kasparov, 25, forced England's Nigel Short to
resign on the 23rd move.
   The speed with which Kasparov, playing white, demolished his
23-year-old opponent, the third-ranked player in the world,
astonished many experts.
   ``It was a kind of quiet annihilation,'' said Greg d'Elia, an
American master who is in Salonica as captain of Lichenstein's team.
   ``First, he trapped Short's king in the center of the board.
Then, with cruel subtlety, Kasparov waited for Short's position to
collapse,'' d' Elia said.
   A further Soviet victory came on board two, when former world
champion Anatoly Karpov won a pawn and squeezed out a victory
against Jonathan Speelman of England.
   This decisive victory over their strongest opposition leaves the
Soviets strongly placed as the 14-round contest nears the half-way
mark. In the last Olympiad, held in 1986 in Dubai, United Arab
Emirates, the Soviets had only amassed 17.5 points by the same stage.
   Sweden moved up to second place by defeating Hungary, the third
seeds, 3-1 following victories from Ferdinand Hellers and Thomas
Ernst.
   East Germany is in third place, while the United States, who won
the bronze medals in the last three competitions, moved up to share
fourth place with Bulgaria.
   Victories from Yasser Seirawan and Larry Christiansen gave the
United States a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia.
   India scored a 4-0 victory over Greece's ``B'' team to join the
leading group in 11th place.
   A win scores one point, and a draw scores a half point.
   In the women's Olympiad, Hungary and the Soviet Union, who
defeated China 3-0, have opened up a gap over a chasing pack.
   Hungary, whose squad features a remarkable trio of sisters _
including Judit Polgar, the highest ranked 12-year-old in history _
seized the lead when they defeted the Soviets 2-1 in the fifth round.
   That match concluded Saturday morning when Polgar drew her
adjourned game with Soviet Grandmaster Irina Levitina.
   The Olympiad, held in Greece's second most populous city, is a
biennial world team championship featuring teams from 106 countries.
   The 14th and final round is scheduled for November 29. Unfinished
games will be completed Sunday with the seventh round played on
Sunday evening.

   Hundreds of thousands of flag-waving
Serbs rallied Saturday for greater control over the troubled
province of Kosovo, while their opponents thronged the provincial
capital in a rally of their own.
   Helmeted riot police closed all roads leading into Kosovo's
capital, Pristina, Saturday to keep ethnic Albanians from converging
on the city. Protesters, who numbered at least 20,000, had mostly
dispersed by midnight, said police officers speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The police actions, later reported on Belgrade television,
followed a warning on the state news agency Tanjug that
``extraordinary measures could be taken'' if the crowds in Pristina,
250 miles south of Belgrade, did not disperse.
   It was the third straight day of street protests in Pristina
triggered by the forced resignations of two ethnic Albanian
Communist leaders.
   However, Kosovo's acting party president told reporters later
Saturday the Communist leadership had decided to use ``exclusively
political measures'' to ease the tension and held out the
possibility that the resignations would be reviewed.
   ``Should it be determined that mistakes were committed in
carrying this out, they (the resignations) will be annulled,'' Party
President Remzi Koljgeci told reporters.
   The mostly young crowds had earlier ignored several warnings from
local Communist party leaders to leave. Tanjug and Kosovo's
Communist leadership said the situation worsened ``from hour to
hour.''
   Serbia's Communist Party leader, Slobodan Milosevic, claimed
Saturday's rally in Belgrade was the largest in Yugoslavia's post
World War II history. The crowd chanted in support.
   Serbia's drive for change in Kosovo ``is a process that nobody
will be able to stop any longer by any force,'' Milosevic told the
crowd.
   ``We enter this battle as we enter all battles _ to win,'' he
added, recalling Serbia's defeats of German armies in World War I
and World War II.
   Trouble erupted in Kosovo on Thursday when two ethnic Albanian
Communist leaders, Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari, were forced to
resign under pressure from Milosevic.
   About 15,000 workers and students rallied in a Pristina sports
hall and later joined a swelling crowd of tens of thousands outside
the local Communist Party headquarters.
   ``We have given our word that we shall lay down our lives for
Kosovo!'' cried the fist-shaking, flag-waving masses, contradicting
Milosevic's claims that the province's ethnic Albanian leaders had
no popular support.
   High-level officials from the national Communist Party were
dispatched from Belgrade to the southern region bordering Albania.
   But the crowds demanded a visit from Stipe Suvar, leader of the
national Communist Party. He is widely perceived to oppose
Milosevic's populist methods.
   Tanjug reported local security officials held an emergency
meeting attended by Vlasi.
   Remzi Koljgeci, acting head of Kosovo's Communist Party, said the
situation in Pristina was more complicated than on Friday, when an
estimated 70,000 ethnic Albanians roamed the city for hours.
   The simmering tension between the ethnic Albanian majority in
Kosovo and the province's Serb and Montenegrin minorities erupted in
violence in 1981, when nine people died in clashes between police
and Albanians demanding more independence from Serbia.
   Martial law was then briefly imposed in Kosovo, which is
administratively part of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics.
   The 1974 constitution granted broad autonomy to Kosovo, an
ancient Serbian heartland where ethnic Albanians now form 90 percent
of the population.
   Milosevic wants the constitution changed to give Serbia more
control over the province's security, educational and judicial
systems.
   He argues this would protect the Slav minority there from alleged
harassment by the ethnic Albanians.
   Saturday's rally in Belgrade, postponed three times out of
apparent fear it would drive ethnic tension out of control, was
billed as the high point of Milosevic's campaign.
   Hailed by his supporters as a strong leader and heir to the late
President Tito, Milosevic is feared by non-Serb Communist leaders
who dislike his populist style and worry his drive for more control
in Kosovo will increase the Serbian say in national affairs.
   Organizers estimated 1.3 million people attended the rally on the
banks of the Sava River. Milosevic asserted it was the biggest
gathering since hundreds of thousands poured onto Belgrade streets
to celebrate liberation from the Nazis in 1944.
   Independent observers gave much lower estimates for the crowds,
who streamed into Belgrade on free buses and trains or on foot.
   Despite some fiery speeches, Saturday's rally was much flatter in
atmosphere than many expected, with the crowd dispersing quickly and
peacefully afterward as heavy rain began falling.
   Milosevic's fighting talk was balanced by two appeals to the
ethnic Albanians to unite with Serbs and work for the ``peaceful
dream'' of the two groups living in harmony in Kosovo.
   Milosevic also called for support of political and economic
reforms outlined by Yugoslavia's Communist leadership to overcome
the economic crisis that has helped fuel ethnic and worker unrest.

   Douglas E. Graves, who handled development of
several major weapons systems during a 43-year career with Boeing
Co., is dead at age 70.
   Graves, who retired in 1983 as vice president and deputy manager
of strategic planning and acquisitions for Boeing Aerospace, died
Thursday of cancer.
   He was responsible for development of systems that made the
United States a leading exporter of weapons technology _ sales and
deployments sometimes conducted after long, bitter controversies.
   Graves managed development of the air-launched cruise missile,
which can evade radar by skimming the ground; the short-range attack
missile; the airborne warning and control system, which enables
intelligence-gathering from reconnaisance aircraft; the E-4 advanced
airborne command post; and military uses of the 747 jumbo jet.
   He also was assistant program manager for the Minuteman
intercontinental nuclear missile.
   ``He was very effective and very sucessful in helping acquire new
business for Boeing,'' said Bill Jury, a Boeing spokesman. ``Other
people then would follow up and complete the project. He was very
effective in recognizing the needs for new systems.''
   Graves worked on nearly every Boeing airplane program during
World War II and the 1950s. He then worked on the missiles and
Minuteman program.
   A native of Great Falls, Mont., and civil engineering graduate of
the University of Washington, Graves was a licensed aeronautical
engineer and an associate fellow of the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics.
   Survivors include his widow, a son, a daughter, two sisters, a
brother and five grandchildren. A memorial service is scheduled
Wednesday at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church.

   A twin-engine plane slammed into a
mountain and caught fire as the pilot made a second attempt to land
in dense fog and thunderstorms, killing all six people on board,
authorities said Saturday.
   The Beechcraft King Air turboprop was cleared to land at the time
of the crash Friday, and other planes had landed safely earlier in
the evening, said Jimmy Watkins, chairman of the Batesville Airport
Commission.
   ``The weather was about as bad as you can get,'' said Roger
Williams, a dispatcher for the Independence County Sheriff's
Department. ``The officers at the scene said it was raining and so
foggy you couldn't see the ground.''
   The plane ``had made one approach and missed the Batesville
airport and they were attempting a second time,'' Williams said.
   Elsewhere, a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza apparently lost
power just minutes after taking off from Brookhaven airport on New
York's Long Island and crashed and burned near the runway Friday,
killing all three on board, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   In Arkansas, officials initially had said seven people died in
the crash in a densely wooded area about 12 miles west of the
Batesville airport, where visibility was near zero.
   ``When we first went out there, the bodies were intermingled,''
Dale Rust, coordinator of the state Office of Emergency Services,
said Saturday. ``We thought there were seven.''
   The plane had taken off from Orange, Texas, outside Beaumont,
said Wayne Beckmann, duty officer at the FAA's southwest regional
office in Fort Worth.
   Independence County Coroner George Barnett identified the victims
as Marlin Thompson, 62, a lawyer from Orange, Texas; his wife,
Linda; pilot Michael Beaumont, no age or hometown available; Dewey
Cox, 55, no hometown available; Robin Steele, no age available; and
Martha Beaumont. Her relationship to Michael Beaumont and her age
and hometown were unavailable. The Thompsons owned a 10,000-acre
private hunting preserve stocked with exotic animals near Batesville.
   In the Long Island crash, the victims were identified as Bernetha
Stewart, 32, and Alciha Smalls, 19, both of Charleston, S.C., and
the plane's owner, Charles Stuart of Shirley, N.Y., said Officer
Susan Romann of the Suffolk County Police Department.

<HEAD>Avril Invites Political Leaders to Commemorate Election-Day
Massacre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's ruler, Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, has invited political leaders to participate in a ceremony
marking the election-day massacre of voters in November 1987, a
radio report said Saturday.
   In an open letter to civic and political leaders, Avril suggested
that all Haitians were responsible for the massacre that ended the
nation's first chance at democratic elections after almost three
decades of rule by the Duvalier family.
   The slaughter has been widely blamed on supporters of the
Duvaliers.
   Avril said ``verbal aggression and physical violence'' led to the
massacre on Nov. 29, when thugs shot and hacked to death at least 34
voters at polling stations, the independent station Radio Haiti
Inter reported.
   ``Once again possessed by the old demons which over the centuries
have caused us grief, the sons of the nation let themselves be
pitted one against the other,'' said the Haitian ruler, who replaced
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a military coup mounted by lower-ranking
soldiers on Sept. 17.
   ``Avril condemns everyone, and in condemning everyone, condemns
no one,'' Sylvio Claude, a frontrunner presidential candidate in the
aborted elections told The Associated Press Saturday.
   ``It is out of the question for us to commemorate the Nov. 29
carnage,'' Claude said. ``The day could be commemorated if the
culprits were arrested and tried.''
   Though the massacre was carried out in daylight by unmasked
gunmen as soldiers watched in trucks without interfering, no one has
been arrested or punished.
   Soldiers who helped bring Avril to power said they are sickened
by acts of state-sponsored violence. Avril has pledged to return
Haiti to democratic rule, but he has announced no timetable for
elections.
   Namphy had ruled since February 1986, when dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to France.

   A construction worker operating a
bulldozer severed a gas main Saturday, causing an explosion that
killed one person, injured 11 others and leveled a vacant store.
   ``The sky seemed to fall on us,'' said Ann Marie Riley, who was
in a car two doors down from the building. ``Debris and glass was
falling like heavy rain.''
   The explosion in this Long Island town shattered windows and sent
debris flying hundreds of feet, witnesses said.
   A construction crew was working in the business district and a
backhoe operator struck the main, said a Suffolk County police
spokeswoman, Officer Susan Romann.
   The driver, realizing what he had done, ran to a shop to call
police, and while he was there the explosion rocked the area. He was
injured by flying glass, police said.
   The construction company had failed to call the Long Island
Lighting Co. to find out the location of the gas line, said utility
spokesman Jerry Mikorenda.
   The dead man was identified as Anibal J. Leiria, 31.
   Four crew members, including the backhoe operator, and seven
bystanders were treated at hospitals for minor injuries, Ms. Romann
said.
   Janet Risener, owner of a gas station across the street from the
vacant store, said she was doing paperwork when her windows blew out
and she saw a big cloud of smoke.
   ``There was wood and concrete up in the air,'' she said, adding
that nearby store and car windows also were shattered.

   Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakia in 1968, met Saturday with Pope
John Paul II.
   The Vatican did not release details of Dubcek's brief private
talk with the Polish-born pope, saying only that Dubcek had asked to
greet John Paul.
   The meeting took place after Dubcek visited the Sistine Chapel.
   Dubcek, making his first trip abroad in 18 years, went to Italy
last week to receive an honorary degree from the University of
Bologna.
   As Communist Party leader in 1968, he tried to liberalize
Czechoslovakia's political and economic life. The attempt was
crushed by a Soviet-led invasion and he was removed from the party
and assigned to a low-level bureaucratic position.

<HEAD>GOP Governor-Elect Decries Reagan Order On Nuclear Plant Emergency
Planning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Gov.-elect Judd Gregg on Saturday
denounced a federal order that could speed licensing of the stalled
Seabrook nuclear power plant and suggested that Gov. John Sununu
helped get President Reagan to sign it.
   Sununu, a staunch advocate of the plant who on Thursday was named
President-elect George Bush's chief of staff, denied any involvement
and said through a spokesman he didn't anticipate the order.
   ``The governor was totally taken by surprise by it,'' said
spokesman Jerry Little.
   The executive order, released by the White House on Friday, gives
the Federal Emergency Management Agency broad new powers to carry
out evacuation plans for nuclear power plants that have been unable
to obtain commercial licenses because of state or local governmental
opposition.
   The $5.7 billion Seabrook reactor was completed more than two
years ago but remains unlicensed mainly because Massachusetts
refuses to cooperate in emergency planning for six communities
within 10 miles of the plant.
   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said Saturday the executive order may
have come too late to help speed licensing for the plant. He noted
that Seabrook has put together its own emergency response
organization for Massachusetts and that FEMA gave the organization
passing grades during an exercise in June.
   ``We're very far along in the licensing process,'' Sher said.
``I'm not sure (the order) helps us very much. We may not need
help.''
   Nevertheless, the order provoked an outcry from opponents of
Seabrook and the similarly stalled Shoreham reactor in New York,
which are the only two plants facing conditions that would be
covered by the order.
   Gregg, a four-term congressman who replaces Sununu on Jan. 5,
supports Seabrook if federal regulators determine that its
evacuation plans are safe. But after a draft of the executive order
surfaced in June, Gregg and the other three members of New
Hampshire's congressional delegation met with Reagan to tell him
they opposed it.
   ``The decision to sign the FEMA order reflects a change in policy
which is totally inappropriate and a mistake,'' Gregg said Saturday
through spokesman Brian Grip.
   ``It will, as I told the president last summer, create at the
minimum a perception that the process for approving safety
requirements for nuclear power plants has been fundamentally changed
in midstream,'' Gregg said.
   ``This action, which I strongly disagree with, has obviously been
influenced by new pressures in Washington,'' Gregg added. ``The way
in which this order was resurrected and floated through the back
channels of the White House is totally inappropriate, especially in
light of the concerns already expressed by the New Hampshire
congressional delegation.''
   Gregg did not return a message Grip passed along seeking
elaboration on his remarks.
   Through spokesman Little, Sununu said any inference that he was
involved in reviving the order ``is absolutely incorrect.''
   ``I haven't heard or spoken about that issue to anyone in the
last two or three months, and I thought it wasn't going to come to
pass because it was now being considered unnecessary as the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission licensing process is moving along well'' for
Seabrook, Sununu said.
   Sununu also referred to a recent NRC rule change, upheld by a
federal court in September, that says utilities may submit their own
emergency plans for reluctant governments. The rule change presumes
reluctant government officials would follow the utility plans in a
real emergency.
   When the draft of the executive order surfaced, a Washington
source told The Associated Press that Sununu was ``up to his
eyeballs in this thing.'' Sununu has denied originating the idea or
lobbying heavily for it.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper, when read Gregg's remarks
Saturday, said the proposed order ``has been under review for
months. It had nothing to do with what you said.''
   Cooper said Sununu ``had discussions with the (White House) staff
several months ago'' on the proposed order, but ``I didn't say he
lobbied heavily.'' Cooper also noted that some congressmen and
senators also had spoken with White House staff members about the
issue.

<HEAD>Brazil Government Makes Offer to Oil Strikers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government made a new offer
Saturday to end the national oil industry's worst strike ever as
supplies of gasoline, cooking oil and other petroleum products were
running out, local news reports said.
   The state-owned oil company, Petrobras, made its proposal after
three hours of negotiations with strike leaders in Brasilia on
Saturday.
   The government offered to pay for five of nine days the workers
have been on the nationwide strike on the condition they end it.
   The strikers originally demanded a 354 percent pay increase, and
Petrobras had offered 70 percent. There was no report of what they
had offered in their latest proposal.
   Oil workers, who earn an average of $300 a month, say they have
lost buying power to inflation, now running at an annual rate of
1,000 percent.
   Members of the National Strike Command in Brasilia said in radio
interviews that they would review the government's proposal over the
weekend. Strike leaders were expected to give their response on
Monday.
   Meanwhile, Brazilians scrimped and rationed to extend stocks of
cooking gas and diesel oil, which had fallen to critical levels. The
respected Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported Saturday that
supplies could run out by Sunday.
   In the northeast, canisters of cooking gas were being rationed
one to each household. Residents of some cities waited overnight on
lines that ran more than a half-mile each to buy canisters of
cooking gas.
   Petrobras officials announced in radio and television broadcasts
that an emergency supply of 2,200 tons of cooking gas imported from
Argentina arrived in Porto Alegre on Saturday.
   Of Brazil's 10 oil refineries, three were partially operating
Saturday.
   The total production stood at 350,000 barrels a day, down from a
full-capacity level of 1.5 million barrels. The country normally
consumes about 1.1 million barrels daily.
   The strike is among several in Brazil by workers angered by a
sputtering economy under President Jose Sareny.
   On Nov. 9, thousands of striking steelworkers stormed Brazil's
biggest steel mill, the National Steel Company mill in Volta
Redonda, 80 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, and hurled rocks and
firebombs at police and soldiers. Two workers were fatally shot and
another was bludgeoned to death, plant officials said.

   Nearly 400 anti-abortion activists were arrested Saturday during
demonstrations nationwide at abortion clinics and doctors' offices,
and 57 Connecticut protesters who refused to give their names were
sent to the state prison.
   One hundred sixty-seven people were arrested in Hartford, Conn.;
about 125 in Buffalo, N.Y.; and 100 in Birmingham, Ala. On Friday,
94 people were arrested in Birmingham, and 57 in Fremont, Calif.
   Most of the demonstrators were supporters of Operation Rescue,
which held protests in about two dozen cities on Oct. 30. Those
demonstrations were linked to a continuing abortion protest in
Atlanta that began when the Democratic National Convention was held
there in July and has resulted in about 1,200 arrests.
   About 250 demonstrators marched outside the Hartford
Gynecological Center clutching rosary beads, chanting prayers and
carrying signs proclaiming ``Abortion: Dial A for Murder'' and
``Give The Unborn a Chance.''
   ``We would love to be able say that no babies were killed at the
Hartford center today,'' said Anne L. Smith, of Chicopee, Mass., who
was handing out literature to patients entering the clinic.
   ``I can't sit home and do my housework if people are being
killed,'' said Smith, who displayed a plastic fetus she was carrying
in her pocket.
   Demonstrators also formed a human chain and sat down on the
walkway leading to the clinic, police said.
   Several patients were escorted into the clinic by police. At
least two patients, both teen-agers, entered the clinic through a
window at the back of building, police said.
   A special court session was convened in Hartford to process the
protesters, who were charged with disorderly conduct, criminal
trespassing and interfering with a police officer, said Hartford
State's Attorney John Bailey. Three were also charged with
assaulting a police officer, he said.
   During their detention, the demonstrators sang Christmas carols,
religious hymns, and civil rights anthems such as ``We Shall
Overcome'' and ``Keep Your Eyes On The Prize.'' But 57 people,
apparently upset over the assault charges, refused to give their
names and were sent to state prisons until they could appear Monday
in Hartford Superior Court, said Bailey.
   The men were jailed in Hartford, while the women were bused to
the state's only women's prison, located 42 miles away in Niantic.
Bailey said he did not know how many women were jailed.
   Bailey said the city had not taken as many people in custody in a
single night since 1968, when black neighborhoods erupted in
violence after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.
   In Buffalo, the protesters were charged with trespassing after
they blocked entrances at the office of a gynecologist who performs
abortions.
   Four buses were used to remove them.
   ``What it is doing is continuing to save babies from abortions,''
said Joe Ciffa, spokesman for Project Rescue, which is affiliated
with Operation Rescue. ``We are continuing to save lives.''
   Police in Alabama had arrested more than 100 people by Saturday
afternoon who were participating in demonstrations at three women's
clinics.
   Most of them were charged with misdemeanor offenses, including
trespassing and harassment, said Maj. Frank Alexander.
   On Friday, 94 people were arrested while blocking entrances in
the first day of protests at the Birmingham Women's Medical Clinic.
   The California protesters targeted a Planned Parenthood office
Friday, police said.
   Some of the protesters made police officers' jobs more difficult
by smearing themselves with petroleum jelly, said police spokesman
Dennis Satariano.

   Local militiamen leading the search for a
Swiss official of the Red Cross gave up their effort Saturday after
failing to find a trace of the kidnap victim, their leader said.
   The local army said it scoured the area in and around this
southern port city after 32-year-old Peter Winkler was grabbed by
gunmen here Thursday.
   ``We have searched the whole Sidon region for Mr. Winkler despite
heavy rains and bad weather conditions, but we couldn't find any
clue to his whereabouts,'' said Abu Yahya, an official of the
Popular Nasserite Organization, a Moslem leftist group.
   ``Our security system will remain interested in his case, but the
major search campaign is over,'' he said.
   No group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping Winkler, who
heads the Sidon office of the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   Officials of the Moslem militia and police believe Winkler was
kidnapped for a possible trade-off with Hussein Hariri, a
22-year-old Lebanese hijacker jailed in Geneva. Hariri, a Shiite
Moslem member of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, hijacked an Air
Afrique jetliner and forced it to land in Geneva on July 24, 1987.
He was arrested after killing a French passenger.
   In addition to Winkler, 14 foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon
by what are believed to be mainly pro-Iranian Shiite factions. Nine
Americans are among the missing. The longest held foreign hostage is
Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Jailed Animal Rights Activist Says She Didn't Mean To Kill Anyone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A animal rights activist accused of
planting a bomb outside a company that demonstrates surgical tools
on dogs and then kills them says she only wanted to scare the
company's chairman.
   ``It would have been purposeless to kill him,'' Fran Trutt was
quoted as saying in an interview published in The Advocate of
Stamford on Sunday. ``But to scare him at this time might have
affected some change, as there are surgical supply companies that
are not torturing dogs or other animals in any way shape or form.
And their products are working just as well for humans.''
   Trutt, 33, faces attempted murder charges for allegedly planting
a radio-controlled pipe bomb outside U.S. Surgical's headquarters on
Nov. 11. Police said the bomb was found near a parking space used by
the company's chairman, Leon Hirsch.
   U.S. Surgical, a company founded by Hirsch 24 years ago, is the
nation's largest supplier of surgical staplers. Company officials
teach doctors how to use the devices in instructional sessions
involving between 700 and 900 dogs each year. Company officials said
stray dogs previously destined to be put to death are used. The dogs
are anesthetized before they are operated on and are destroyed
before they awaken.
   In the interview from the Connecticut Correctional Institution at
Niantic, Trutt also said she was acting alone and that she did not
make the bomb.
   She claimed, however, that her actions are being hailed by animal
rights activists.
   ``I am not the only who feels this way,'' she said. ``Others are
willing to take action to affect a change so that this live torture
will stop.''
   Some animal rights groups, including one that had petitioned
state health authorities to stop the experimentation at U.S.
Surgical, have disassociated themselves with Trutt and emphasized
that they oppose violence.
   Trutt, who lives in the Queens section of New York City, is being
held on $500,000 bond on charges of attempted murder, possession of
explosives and manufacturing bombs. A second bond hearing is
scheduled for Nov. 29 in Stamford.

   The northern coast of Honduras was put under a
tropical storm watch as a late-season, poorly organized tropical
depression with top winds of 35 mph drifted westward across the
Caribbean Sea Saturday.
   The government of Honduras also issued a tropical storm warning
for Swan Island, which has been used as a staging area for supplies
to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The center of the storm, traveling west at 5 to 10 mph, was about
150 miles southeast of the island after passing well south of
Jamaica late Friday and early Saturday, the National Hurricane
Center reported.
   Little significant change in strength was expected Saturday,
forecasters said. However, conditions were favorable for some
gradual strengthening afterward as it turned to the northwest.
   ``It looks like it's better organized,'' said hurricane
forecaster Hal Gerrish. ``The environment is a little more
favorable'' for development.
   Heavy rains were possible along the path of the depression,
extending several hundred miles to the north and east of the poorly
defined center. Kingston, Jamaica reported nearly 4 inches of rain
over a 24-hour period.
   Small craft along the northern coast of Honduras and Swan Island
were advised to remain in port.
   Atlantic hurricane seasons begin June 1 and end on Nov. 30, with
storm activity usually peaking in mid-September.

   U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue
Service agents raided the offices of penny-stock broker Blinder,
Robinson & Co. on Saturday, told employees to leave and began going
through records.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation
of the company last year, alleging that customers had been defrauded.
   Alan Jacobson, an attorney for the company, confirmed that a
search warrant had been served covering 53 customers and 15
companies.
   ``They were apparently the subject of an IRS and U.S. Attorney's
Office investigation,'' Jacobson said. ``None of the 53 persons are
presently or formerly associated with or employed under Blinder,
Robinson. None of the companies are underwritten by Blinder,
Robinson. No one told us today that Blinder, Robinson is a target of
the investigation, just that there is an investigation,'' Jacobson
said.
   The agents refused to say what they were looking for.
   The firm recently was the subject of a story on the CBS News
program ``60 Minutes.''
   The commission at the time said it was examining allegations
dating to August 1983 that Blinder, Robinson violated federal law by
marketing nine distributions of unregistered securities by falsely
representing the business prospects of the companies involved, and
by excessively marking up the prices of the securities.
   The SEC also had two other actions pending against the company,
which was the nation's largest penny-stock broker with 66 offices in
37 states.
   Penny stocks are relatively inexpensive and high-risk securities
issued by firms whose shares do not trade on the major stock
exchanges.
   The SEC allegations accused the company of bookkeeping violations.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers also levied
penalties totaling $250,000 against the company in 1987 for charging
excessive markups in the price of shares for one of its issues.
   The shares involved Telephone Exchange Corp. The NASD studied
more than a thousand transactions after Telephone Express went
public in 1984 and found that the company controlled 97 percent of
the transactions and charged excessive prices in all but three
transactions.
   The NASD said markups went as high as 150 percent. NASD rules
limited markups at the time to 10 percent above a brokerage firm's
cost.
   The company was suspended from doing business for five days, and
six executives were suspended from the brokerage business for 90
days.

<TEXT>
   Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov has agreed to
help set the ``Doomsday Clock'' used by the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists to depict the state of tension among nuclear powers, the
magazine announced Saturday.
   Sakharov, who has been traveling in this country, was contacted
in Cambridge, Mass., by Bernard Feld, a physicist at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and former editor of the Bulletin.
   ``He was very pleased to be asked and had been interested in the
Bulletin for some time,'' Feld reported to the magazine staff.
   Sakharov becomes the 18th Nobel laureate among the 44 members of
the Bulletin's board of sponsors, which helps decide where to put
the minute hand of the ``Doomsday Clock'' that has been featured on
the cover of the magazine for 41 years.
   At present, it is at six minutes to midnight, one minute closer
to doomsday that it was when it first appeared in 1947. Over the
years, the time has been as distant as 12 minutes and as near as two
minutes.
   By joining the board of sponsors, Sakharov, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1975, ``affirmed a belief in what the Bulletin stands
for,'' said spokeswoman Lisa Grayson.
   She said the magazine's philosphy is that only by informing the
public on the hazards of the nuclear age can a nuclear disaster be
avoided.

   President Reagan has signed an executive order
aimed at speeding the nuclear-plant licensing process by giving a
federal agency sweeping new powers to carry out evacuation plans for
disputed nuclear power plants.
   The principal aim of the order is to help utilities get operating
licenses in instances where community opposition has held up
approval of evacuation plans. The plans must be OK'd by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission before a license is granted.
   The operation of two plants, Shoreham on Long Island, N.Y., and
Seabrook in New Hampshire, has been stalled because state and local
governments, responding to community pressures, have refused to
submit evaucation plans to the NRC.

   The nation's health care costs jumped 9.8
percent last year to $500.3 billion, or $1,987 for every man, woman
and child, a federal report says.
   The annual report issued Friday by the Health Care Financing
Administration highlighted one of the major challenges facing the
incoming Bush administration: how to insure health care for an aging
population during a time when spending on Medicare and Medicaid is
already a major contributor to the national debt.
   The popular conception is that Medicare is self-financed by
Social Security payroll deductions paid by retired and current
workers. The reality is that 75 percent of the money to pay for the
fastest growing part of the program _ doctor services _ comes
straight from the treasury.

   Three unmanned locomotives raced at more
than 80 mph through five towns and across more than 200 miles of
west Texas plains until workers diverted them onto a siding, where
they crashed into a line of empty boxcars, officials said.
   Vandals are suspected of setting the linked Union Pacific diesel
locomotives loose in Big Spring, about 100 miles south of Lubbock,
about 1:30 a.m. Friday. No one was injured.
   The engines sped through railroad crossings without headlights or
any other warning. The straight track west of Big Spring helped keep
the engines from derailing along the way.

<HEAD>U.S. Oil Companies In Transition; Some Fear Change</HEAD>

   The U.S. oil refining industry is booming and a
new breed of foreign investor will soon be sharing the profits.
   But some fear the newcomers will only add more uncertainty to an
already volatile industry. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and China are
among the latest owners of U.S. oil refining assets.
   All are major oil producers; two are members of OPEC with the
potential to exert power over the American oilpatch.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been blamed
for the recent glut of oil on world markets and the resulting drop
in oil prices that has hurt U.S. exploration and production.
   But industry experts attending the annual meeting here of the
American Petroleum Institute this past week said U.S. refiners
welcome their newest partners in business.
   ``The idea of foreign investment is a positive one. It's money
coming into the U.S. to buy an existing plant like any other plant.
I don't see any problem with it,'' says John H. Lichtblau, president
of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
   Jim Bailey, spokesman for the Coastal Corp., an independent
refiner that last month signed a joint venture deal with China, says
investment by producing countries will ``help smooth out extremely
volatile price and supply swings and assures us of a long-term
relationship with a crude oil supplier.''
   But others fear foreign producer ownership of U.S. assets
jeopardizes national security and further reduces incentives to
improve domestic production.
   ``Just like everything else, we're selling our assets abroad
(under the guise that) supposedly it will be helping shareholders,''
said James L. Van Alen, an analyst with Janney Montgomery.
   Most of the nation's major oil companies recently reported huge
profits in their refining operations, thanks to surging consumer
demand and low crude prices. But in a highly cyclical business,
conditions could shift.
   Economist Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, market research director for
Ashland Oil Inc., believes joint ventures with producing countries
will provide U.S. companies with sound business partners ``willing
to take part of the risk in a cyclical business.''
   But Tahmassebi acknowledges there are concerns.
   ``One can argue ... that joint venture arrangements might lead to
lower oil prices, reduced domestic production and increased
imports,'' he said. ``In this indirect manner, such arrangements may
have national security implications.''
   Texaco Inc.'s recent pact with Saudi Arabia touched off the
latest concern about foreign ownership of U.S. oil assets.
   Under the joint venture, the Saudis will pay Texaco some $812
million in exchange for half-ownership of Texaco refining assets in
23 eastern and Gulf Coast states and Washington D.C. The Saudis will
supply 75 percent of the initial oil inventory and each partner will
provide 50 percent of the working capital, according to Texaco.
   Analysts agree that Texaco invited the Saudis in because it
needed cash. Texaco expects $1.8 billion in cash benefits and
savings from the venture to pay the debt stemming from its $3
billion settlement with Pennzoil Co., the company said.
   But there were other reasons as well.
   Tahmassebi says the Saudi deal ensures Texaco secure access to
Saudi crude at competitive prices. Under the deal, Texaco said it
has the right to buy up to 600,000 barrels a day at market prices.
   A citizens group opposed the deal and called on the government to
halt the sale until the new administration could determine if it is
in the country's best interest.
   But analysts said the Reagan Administration welcomed it as a
source of greater supply security.
   Lichtblau believes much of the criticism is groundless. Arguments
about foreign producer partners disrupting supplies, as OPEC has in
the past, don't make sense, he says.
   ``They wouldn't supply their own refinery? They would hardly
target their own refinery.''
   Analysts also say oil imported under the deals is not displacing
domestic oil and in fact the new influx of funds may go toward
further exploration and production by U.S. companies.
   Joint ventures are not new. Britain and Holland have been in the
United States for decades through British Petroleum Co. and Royal
Dutch Shell.
   ``The new trend is the OPEC countries coming here _ and China,''
Lichtblau said.
   Since the 1986 price collapse, Tahmassebi says ``practically
every OPEC country has seriously considered the idea of buying
overseas refineries or embarking on some kind of a joint venture
arrangement.''
   Venezuela is said to be the biggest investor in refineries in
consuming countries. It now owns some 240,000 barrels per day of
U.S. refining capacity, including its recent purchase of a 50
percent interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp.
   Coastal's deal with China involves a 55,000 barrel per day
refinery in Hercules, Calif., as well as storage facilities in
California and Oregon.
   Lichtblau estimates that OPEC countries and China together now
own 7 percent of the nation's 13 million barrel per day refining
capacity.
   Industry sources believe U.S. refining is ripe for further
investment.
   Sun Oil Co. is seriously negotiating with Nigeria, analysts say,
and Ashland Oil Chairman John Hall acknowledges that his company
also is looking for the ``right'' deal with a foreign investor.

   In other business news this past week:
   _OPEC oil ministers met in Vienna, Austria, to try to fashion a
new production agreement that would limit output and push up prices.
Analysts were skeptical about the chances for success.
   _The government said the trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent to
$10.5 billion in September, but the report wasn't good enough to
rally support for the sagging dollar. Central banks from around the
world bought dollars in the foreign exchange market at week's end in
a coordinated effort to prop up the currency, whose value was
depressed by market worries about the trade and budget deficits.
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a federal
commission that the budget deficit required urgent action.
President-elect George Bush, seeking to calm the financial markets,
said he intends to tackle the problem quickly in the new
administration.
   _A government report showed retail sales shot up 0.9 percent in
October, the strongest increase in seven months. In other reports,
factory production rose 0.4 percent in October, housing construction
increased 7.2 percent during the month and business inventories were
up 0.7 percent in September.
   _The Big Three automakers said their car sales rose 17.8 percent
in early November over depressed levels in the same period last year.
   _Continental Airlines announced a restructured ``MaxSaver''
program boosting most of its remaining cut-rate fares. Some
competitors followed suit.
   _A special directors committee of RJR Nabisco Inc. was expected
to review competing buyout bids from a management team and another
group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over the weekend. Another
buyout firm, Forstmann Little & Co. and its partners, withdrew from
the bidding. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. sued RJR
Nabisco, charging that the takeover planned by Nabisco's management
had devastated the insurer's holdings in Nabisco bonds.
   _Holly Farms Corp. moved to sidestep a hostile takeover by rival
poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc. by agreeing to be acquired by
ConAgra Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $1 billion.
   _MAI Basic Four Inc., a California computer company controlled by
New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, launched an unsolicited $970
million takeover offer for the much larger Prime Computer Inc.
   _A Treasury Department task force studying the savings and loan
crisis concluded that taxpayer money must be spent to rescue the
ailing system.
   _The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments on whether investor
claims against brokers must be settled by binding arbitration.
   _A federal appeals court refused to oust U.S. District Judge
Milton Pollack from presiding over the civil insider trading case
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   _The U.S. Tax Court ruled that points paid in connection with the
refinancing of a home mortgage must be written off over the life of
the loan, rather than in the year the cost was incurred.
   _The Transportation Department ordered a wide range of drug
testing, including random checks, for more than 4 million
transportation workers from airline pilots and flight attendants to
truckers and railroaders.
   _Allstate Insurance Co. said it would stop doing business in
Massachusetts due to losses from the state's tough insurance laws,
echoing anger among insurers nationwide over changing regulatory
climates.
   _Media magnate Rupert Murdoch and nine hotel chains formed a
venture to develop and run a new computerized hotel reservations
system called UltraSwitch. Murdoch also announced plans to begin a
new women's magazine led by Grace Mirabella, who left Vogue in July.

   Although it has shaken up the securities markets,
many Wall Street analysts say the renewed decline in the dollar is
no cause for great alarm.
   The dollar's slump in foreign exchange, which took it Thursday to
the verge of a modern low against the Japanese yen, intensified
after the U.S. election early this month.
   And it was widely attributed to worries, especially among foreign
investors, about what actions the administration of President-elect
George Bush would take to cut the federal budget deficit.
   But many observers say the circumstances don't justify any big
surge of pessimism.
   ``We believe that the outburst of hysteria about both the budget
and the dollar are unwarranted,'' said Edward Yardeni, economist at
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   The debate over what action Bush might adopt to reduce the budget
deficit ignores the fact that measures have already been taken in
that direction, Yardeni observed.
   The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 is already on the books
mandating steady reductions in the budget deficit over the next
several years.
   Worries have also surfaced that the dollar must go lower if the
United States is going to show continuing improvement in its trade
deficit, the gap between the imports it consumes and the exports it
is able to make and sell.
   Even if that is so, maintains John Connolly at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., ``given the already substantial decline since early
1985, it may not entail that much movement from the current level.
   ``The specter of a free-fall, as developed in 1987, should be
discounted. A really sharp drop in the dollar would make U.S.
industry too competitive.
   ``Since we are probably not all that far from an equilibrium
level, it should not be too difficult for the central banks to get
us to that level without excessive turmoil.''
   Despite such assurance, the stock market remained on the
defensive in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 78.77 points the week before, lost another 4.62 to
2,062.41.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.06 to 150.18;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped
6.16 to 367.58, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 4.81 at 286.67.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 136.08 million shares a day,
against 138.62 million in the preceding week.
   The Federal Reserve gave an indication Thursday and Friday that
it believed the dollar had fallen far enough. The Fed and central
banks of other industrialized countries intervened in the foreign
exchange markets to support the dollar, and the currency steadied.
   Intervention of this kind has its limits as well as it uses. With
all the massive resources at their disposal, many economists argue,
the central banks of the world cannot change long-term trends in the
marketplace.
   For many skeptics to become believers in a dollar recovery, the
dollar would probably have to turn in a steady showing on its own
for at least a few days without government help.
   If the dollar must go lower before that happens, some analysts
argue, so be it.
   Though a falling dollar does threaten to scare off foreign
investors with their much-needed capital, these analysts say, it
also might well yield some positive results.
   ``It would give yet another boost to our exports,'' asserted
Yardeni. ``The trade deficit would narrow at a faster pace.''
