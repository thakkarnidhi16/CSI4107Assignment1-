   Inmates at the Hall County jail,
apparently upset about being locked up on Christmas Eve, staged a
protest Saturday night, setting fires and causing an undetermined
amount of damage before the uprising was ended, authorities said.
   The disturbance, which began about 8:30 p.m., was under control
by 11:30 p.m., said Sgt. Ed Barfield, spokesman for the Hall County
Sheriff's Department. There were no injuries, he said.
   ``They were disgruntled,'' Barfield said. ``It's overcrowded
here; we've got them one on top of another. It's Christmas. They
were just disgruntled.''
   Barfield said the disturbance occurred in a cell block housing
about 30 inmates. He said he did not know how many participated in
the unrest.
   The inmates set fires to mattresses, and ``a good bit of damage''
was done to light fixtures and air ducts, he said. There also was
considerable water damage.
   Barfield said a county SWAT team, as well as city police and
state corrections officials, were called in to help quell the
disturbance.
   Officers planned to stay on the scene Sunday morning in case
there was a recurrence, he said.

<HEAD>DOE Modernization Report: SRP Reactors Not Expected To Restart
Until Late '89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense officials now say the Savannah River
Plant's three nuclear reactors probably won't be fully operational
until late 1989, according to a federal report.
   Energy officials had said they hoped to get the three reactors at
the Aiken, S.C., facility back in operation for tritium production
by late spring or midsummer.
   An executive summary of the Department of Energy's defense
complex modernization plan said that in spite of planned safety and
maintenance improvements, the plant's reactors ``may not be able to
achieve acceptable production efficiencies,'' according to a story
published Sunday in the Augusta-based Morris Communications Corp.
newspapers.
   On Thursday, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said DOE has
decided to use ultrasonic testing to check for cracks in the vessel
of the Savannah plant's K reactor, a move that probably will keep
the reactor down until at least June. K reactor, one of three at the
plant, has been targeted to restart first.
   According to the report obtained by the newspaper group, ``The
existing production reactors, at their current power limits, have
limited operational capability.''
   Those reactors are one example of the fact that ``many facilities
throughout the (weapons) complex are approaching the end of their
useful lives,'' the report said.
   As much as $81 billion will be needed over the next 21 years to
modernize and clean up DOE defense facilities, the report said.
   The Energy Department operates a number of facilities that help
produce materials for nuclear weapons. The Savannah plant, located
across the Georgia-South Carolina border from Augusta, is one of
several that have been plagued recently with reports of safety
lapses and other problems.
   The three SRP reactors currently are the nation's sole production
source of tritium, a radioactive isotope that enhances the explosive
power of nuclear warheads. Tritium decays 5.5 percent annually and
must be regularly replenished in warheads.

<TEXT>
   Relatives of two French girls held captive
by Palestinian guerrillas more than a year met with a representative
of the kidnappers Sunday, the day after the kidnappers promised to
release them.
   The meeting took place at the office of Walid Khaled, the
spokesman of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council group, in the Mar Elias
Palestinian refugee camp in West Beirut.
   An unidentified French reporter accompanying the relatives came
out of the meeting and told reporters that Khaled told them: ``We
shall release the two girls along with a videotape.''
   It was not clear when the girls, Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6,
daughters of Jacqueline Valente, would be released.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council, headed by reputed terrorist Abu
Nidal, declared Nov. 8, 1987 it had seized the girls, their French
mother and five Belgian adults aboard a French yacht off the Gaza
Strip.
   The group said Saturday the girls would be released within 24
hours.
   The meeting was attended by Ms. Valente's mother, Brigitte
Valente, her former husband Pascal Batille and brother-in-law Andre
Metral.
   The Fatah statement said the girls would be released in response
to an appeal from Libyan leader Col. Moammar Ghadafi, the group's
main backer.

   Four slopes for men and two for women were
opened at a resort north of Tehran as Iran kicked off its ski
season, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
   The segregated ski slopes were opened at the mountain resort of
Dizin, about 30 miles outside the capital, which had its first
snowfall on Sunday, the agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, also said the resort of
Shemshak north of Tehran was opened following sufficient snowfall in
recent weeks.
   Iran's Shiite Moslem government interprets Islamic law as
dictating the strict segregation of the sexes in public activities
where women are not veiled.
   The report said Dizin will host an international ski competition
in February with six nations participating to mark the 10th
anniversary of the Islamic revolution that toppled the late shah. It
did not specify which countries would take part.

<TEXT>
   The view from the Wearmouth Bridge is
a melancholy one. The last shipyard is closing, and the River Wear,
once smothered in coal dust and bustling with boats, lies silent,
waiting for landscapers to turn its banks into parkland.
   The other side of this eerie, elegiac metaphor for a greening,
post-industrial Britain lies just up the road, where a sprawling new
shopping center has replaced the clang of hammers on steel with the
chirp of busy cash registers.
   Britain, once the Workshop of the World, is being transformed
into a nation of shopkeepers, tourist guides, bankers and high-tech
entrepreneurs, and nowhere is this more evident than in northeast
England.
   Seventy years ago, at the height of empire, British yards built
one-third of the world's tonnage, and gruff, grimy, noisy Sunderland
was the Detroit of shipbuilding.
   But like most Western ship industries, Britain's has shrunk with
the onset of Far East competition. Of 1,528 ships launched worldwide
last year, just 31 were British.
   Now, with the government's announcement Dec. 8 that it is closing
North East Shipbuilders Ltd., Sunderland's 600-year-old shipbuilding
industry has reached its end.
   The 2,400 jobs lost will bump Sunderland's male unemployment
above the 20-percent mark after a steady fall in the past two years
from 23.6 percent to 19.1 percent.
   ``I never imagined this could happen. I thought there'd always be
a yard here,'' said Ernie Hunter, 56, a short, broad-shouldered man
who went to work as a ship's plumber at the age of 14.
   But all over the northeast, in former citadels of heavy industry
like Newcastle, Sheffield and Sunderland, new life is sprouting amid
the rubble of the smokestack industries.
   Coal, steel, shipbuilding and textiles are being supplanted by
computer manufacturing, Japanese auto plants, retailing, tourism _ a
northern counterbalance to the financial markets of London that have
blossomed under the free-market doctrines of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   The Bridges, Sunderland's glittering new indoor shopping center,
is one example. Even more striking is the Metrocentre, a short train
ride away, which claims to be Europe's largest combined shopping and
leisure complex with three miles of shopping malls, 10,000 parking
spaces, and an indoor amusement park complete with roller coaster.
   North East Shipbuilders' compensation package includes $80
million to redevelop the docks and teach workers new skills. The
future of the new Britain depends on whether men in their 40s, who
have spent their lives in overalls welding, hammering, plumbing and
riveting, can find new lives as shopkeepers, computer programmers
and hotel keepers.
   The response so far seems lukewarm.
   ``It's closure on the cheap, a bloody insult to a skilled
workforce,'' said Alan Milburn, a researcher who is heading a
campaign to save the shipyards.
   Many of the men are hoping the campaign will succeed, and of a
dozen interviewed at random during the dying days of North East
Shipbuilders, none appeared to have given any thought to acquiring a
new skill.
   Brian Brown, a welder, asked sardonically whether Sunderland
needed 2,400 extra shopkeepers, while another welder, Kenny Downes,
noted that the failure rate for new businesses is more than 50
percent.
   The closure came as no surprise.
   ``We always knew that in shipbuilding there's boom times and
slack times,'' said Brown, sitting amid the Christmas decorations in
his living room. ``But then it started to get less and less boom and
more and more slack and the writing was on the wall by the early
'80s.''
   Men like Brown stand to receive about $33,000 on average in
severance pay. His mortgage is paid off, his children almost grown,
but that does not make life on the dole more attractive for a
vigorous 49-year-old man who was born and bred in Sunderland and
wants to stay here.
   The unions insist NESL's modern facilities can still turn a
profit. They point to studies predicting a global upturn in
shipbuilding in the 1990s.
   ``To write the United Kingdom as a maritime trading island nation
out of the world shipbuilding market is industrially, economically
and strategically crazy,'' said Milburn.
   Most British shipyards were nationalized by Harold Wilson's Labor
government in 1977, and since Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives came to
office in 1979, they have been steadily winding down the industry.
With NESL's demise, the state will no longer own any shipyards.
   Milburn accuses the government of being so ideologically obsessed
with denationalizing and winding down heavy industry that it
deliberately resisted outside offers to buy the yards.
   But Industry Minister Tony Newton told Parliament none of these
offers ``constituted a viable future,'' and ``I was not prepared to
pretend something provided a future when I didn't think it did. That
would have been the worst service I could have provided for the
people of Sunderland.''
   Sunderland, a city of 200,000, was never a garden spot. A
19th-century travelers' handbook described it as ``enshrouded in the
blackest gloom of smoke,'' while a French doctor wrote in 1831 of
``a picture of wretchedness, filth and poverty.''
   Shipbuilding, recorded in Sunderland as far back as 1346, was its
lifeblood. Its ships kept Britain in touch with its empire and even
afterward, in the 1970s, it produced the sturdy and highly popular
SD14 cargo ship, the Boeing 747 of the modern shipping age, more
than 150 of which were launched.
   Today, the self-assuredness of industrial might has given way to
uncertainty, as its municipal museum illustrates in the recorded
commentary accompanying a slide show of its history.
   ``Sunderland,'' it says, ``is no longer the grimy, pulsating
industrial metropolis it was. It's cleaner, less clouded, much
healthier. But not perhaps much happier. The heart is not there now.
The busy river that gave life to the town... is an emptiness that
the planners seek to fill _ to landscape for leisure the banks that
were once crammed with industry, commerce, homes, and life.
   ``Sunderland is a town with a great past. Now we're looking for a
new kind of future.''

   A cloud of thick, red dust stirred by
strong winds significantly reduced visibility in the capital Sunday
and marred Christmas celebrations for many Sudanese who
traditionally spend the day picnicking.
   Mohamed Mussa, an official with the Sudanese meteorological
department, told The Associated Press the dust storm and winds would
last at least through the day.
   Mussa said visibility was 200 yards, ``which surely means planes
cannot land in the airport today until the dust has been blown
away.'' The weather also created huge traffic jams.
   The dust storm started Saturday, making breathing difficult for
many Sudanese and covering everything, including people, with thick
red and white dust.
   Although more than 90 percent of the Sudanese are Moslems, many
join their Christian friends in Christmas celebrations by driving
into the countryside outside of Khartoum for picnics.

<HEAD>Indians Seek New York Investigation of North Carolina County</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for two American Indians charged
with kidnapping in the takeover of a newspaper office are urging New
York authorities to investigate corruption charges in a North
Carolina county.
   ``We are hopeful that Gov. (Mario) Cuomo will respond positively
to the phone calls and telegrams he's been getting,'' said Allen
Gregory, an attorney for Christic Institute South, which is
representing Timothy Jacobs. ``We hope he will have his attorney
general investigate drug trafficking and corruption in Robeson
County.''
   Jacobs, 20, fled to New York after being indicted on 14 counts of
second-degree kidnapping by a special session of the Robeson County
grand jury Dec. 6. He was arrested in Oneida, N.Y., a week later and
released to the Onondaga Indian Nation Reservation under $25,000
bond. An extradition hearing is scheduled Jan. 12 in New York.
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, who was indicted on the same charges, said a
week ago that he had also fled to the reservation because his life
had been threatened in Robeson County. He had been arrested Dec. 6
and was freed on $25,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear Jan. 16 at
the Robeson County Superior Court in Lumberton, 100 miles south of
Raleigh.
   The National Council of Churches paid bonds for both men.
   The indictments came less than two months after they were
acquitted of federal hostage-taking charges in the Feb. 1 takeover
of The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton.
   Up to 20 people were held as hostages for 10 hours while Hatcher
demanded an investigation of alleged drug trafficking by law
enforcement officers and corruption in local government.
   The siege ended after Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a state task
force to investigate the charges, but Martin said last week all the
task force found was ``rumors and gossip.''
   Martin said Hatcher, Jacobs and their supporters were attempting
to win public sympathy by claiming that they are the victims of
political persecution. ``All of the rhetorical excess in the world
is not going to persuade me that they should not face those
charges,'' Martin said. ``What they did was endanger the lives of
those people.''
   But attorneys for Jacobs say an investigation of Robeson County
by New York authorities would show that Jacobs was telling the truth
about corruption there and that he would be in danger if he was
extradited back to North Carolina.
   Cuomo was not in his office this week and other New York
officials declined to comment on the request for an investigation.
   Lawyers for Christic Institute South, of Carrboro, met with North
Carolina Attorney General Lacy Thornburg after the federal trial to
ask for an investigation of Robeson County. But Thornburg told them
the county had been part of a long-running investigation of drug
trafficking.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, who prosecuted the two
Indians in federal court, said their efforts had hindered federal
investigations.
   Hatcher and Jacobs have charged that the state indictments are a
``vindictive'' act by District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, a
frequent target of minority critics. Britt, who leaves the
prosecutor's office Jan. 1 to become a Superior Court judge, has
called the charge ``ridiculous.''
   Richard Townsend, an assistant district attorney named last week
to succeed Britt, said he intends to continue the prosecution, but
said he has had little time to study the kidnapping case.
   ``Obviously, we're going to proceed with the extradition of Mr.
Jacobs,'' he said.

   It may not be the crowning achievement in
dentist David Gilmore's career, but it was the first time he did
root canal for a canine _ dog that is, not the the spot between the
incisors and the bicuspids.
   Gilmore recently performed a root canal on Hasso, the Meridian
Police Department's drug-sniffing German shepherd. It was
preliminary work for a crown to be done in about three weeks.
   Police patrolman J.B. Rocco, one of several officers in the
city's three-dog K-9 Patrol Unit, said Hasso fractured a tooth
during a demonstration earlier this month. The tooth, the officer
said, was broken when Hasso bit down on a metal pipe.
   The pipe was used to reward Hasso for good work. ``He loves to
play with it; that's his reward,'' Rocco said.
   ``Normally, we would just pull the tooth, but we're talking about
the business end of a $6,000 dog,'' Rocco said. ``We just didn't
want to take any chances of having it break off any more.''
   Besides, the patrolman said, Gilmore likes dogs. The crown work
would normally cost more than $500 but is being done free as a
service to the city.
   Gilmore said he expected no complications from the procedure, and
Hasso should soon be snapping back into action.
   ``He's going to look pretty wicked when he growls, with that
silver tooth showing,'' Gilmore said.

   The mayor is switching from the
Democratic Party to the Republican Party, so it's appropriate that
he got post-election greetings from the presidential candidates of
both parties.
   ``I thought it was a joke at first,'' said Mayor Terry Hartwick,
who is leaving office as a Democrat on Dec. 31, and plans to join
the GOP in January.
   But it was no joke. Hartwick got a letter in the handwriting of
Democrat Michael Dukakis, postmarked Dec. 19 and embossed with the
Massachusetts governor's home address.
   It thanked Hartwick for his support _ the mayor didn't say for
whom he voted _ and said, ``You will be very much in our thoughts in
the days ahead.''
   A typewritten letter from President-elect George Bush, dated two
days before the Nov. 8 general election in which the vice president
beat Dukakis, also thanks Hartwick for his support.
   The GOP politcian-to-be said he hung Bush's letter in his home.
As for Dukakis' correspondence, ``I don't know what to think. I
guess we'll keep this one, too.
   ``I'm getting to be pretty popular these days,'' said Hartwick,
who was defeated for re-election in the spring primary.

<HEAD>Britain Refuses To Comply With Human Rights Court Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has refused to comply with a
European Court of Human Rights ruling that says a law allowing
terrorism suspects to be held up to a week without charges violates
the European Convention on Human Rights.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd announced the decision to Parliament
on Thursday.
   In a test ruling last month, the European Court of Human Rights
based in Strasbourg, France, said terrorist suspects should be
charged and brought before a court within four days.
   It said the detention by British police in 1984 of four men
without charge for more than four days breached the human rights
conventions.
   Britain is a signatory to the conventions and has formally
accepted that rulings by the court regarding the convention shall be
binding.
   But the conventions allow a country to opt out in cases where its
government claims the measure in question is vital ``in time of war
or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation.''
Referring to strife-torn Northern Ireland, this is what the British
government has claimed.
   ``There is a public emergency within the meaning of these
provisions in respect of terrorism connected with the affairs of
Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom,'' Hurd said.
   Members of the opposition Labor Party denounced the decision by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government not to
comply with the court ruling.
   Marjorie Mowlam, one of Labor's Northern Ireland spokeswomen,
said the government seemed intent on dragging Britain's reputation
through the mud.
   ``The government has missed a chance to make progress toward
restoring respect for the rule of law in Northern Ireland,'' she
said.
   The law is used mostly against suspects from both sides of the
sectarian divide in Northern Ireland, where the Irish Republic Army
is fighting to end British rule.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule. Protestant hardliners reject all talk of union with the
Republic.

<HEAD>Christmas Climax: Telephone Ad Campaign Ends In Father and Child
Reunion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-month series of New England Telephone Co.
commercials that touched viewers' hearts with a story about a father
and daughter's attempts to reconcile reached a happy ending on
Christmas Day.
   Not that the outcome was really in doubt.
   ``We're the telephone company,'' said advertising director
Geraldine O'Brien. ``We don't do unhappy endings.''
   The story, which had unfolded since July on television and radio
in five New England states, had prompted intense audience interest
and speculation about how the father-daughter standoff would be
resolved.
   Priests delivered sermons derived from the commercials, a
billboard urging daughter Jill to ``Call Dad'' appeared, talk show
hosts threw open their microphones to listeners with an opinion on
the family drama, and at least one troubled family produced its own
videotape takeoff on the tear-jerker.
   ``Some people take it very seriously, which as an advertiser
amazes me,'' Ms. O'Brien said. ``People are participating in it as
if it's real life.''
   In a dispute apparently sparked by the man in her life, Jill and
her dad had not spoken in two years. The first spot saw sister Kathy
making a stab at bringing them back together, only to have Dad hang
up at the mention of his estranged daughter's name.
   In subsequent ads, Dad called back to apologize for his rash
response but refused to bury the hatchet, and Kathy pleaded with her
sister to make amends before it was too late.
   In the campaign's climax Sunday, Jill at last picked up the
telephone and, in a gesture of apparent holiday good will, called
home. Dad responded by tearfully admitting: ``I was wrong. I had no
right to interfere in your life like that.''
   ``I've missed you so much, Dad,'' Jill returned, as the camera
panned over various grinning family members.
   The $5 million campaign exposed themes of vanity and false pride,
said the Rev. Philip McGraw of Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted
in Waltham, Mass., who recently gave a Sunday sermon inspired in
part by the commercials.
   ``I've used the slogan `Reach out and touch someone' many times,
as I think we all have,'' the Roman Catholic priest said. ``And this
was similar. I used the commercial in the context of compassion.
   ``If we don't do the right things, like make the effort to solve
family quarrels, we diminish ourselves,'' he said. ``It takes so
little effort to make others feel better that it would be
unthinkable not to try.''
   Gregory Payne, chairman of Emerson College's communications
department, said the aura of reality helped make the advertisements
so successful.
   ``It's the first time people are taking a mini-series, soap opera
approach. It's demanded a coactive response from the audience,''
Payne said, adding that the campaign's timing was no coincidence.
   ``It's especially effective at a time like Christmas when
families are drawing together, because people want to forgive and
forget,'' he said.
   ``It's a pretty subliminal message. Many people will say to
themselves `Hey, it's been awhile since I've seen the old man' and
give it a try. Of course, what will happen to those of us who act
that out isn't revealed in the ad.''
   Ms. O'Brien said most customers asked said they considered the
telephone among the best ways to mend fences.
   ``I don't want to get too psychological, but sometimes it's
easier to reconcile by phone,'' she said. ``Sometimes if you've had
an argument _ as often happens in families _ there's the fear of a
rebuff or rejection face to face. It's easier to make up by
telephone.''
   Although ineligible for a Nielsen rating, ``The Family'' radio
and TV spots proved more than an expression of good will for the
telephone company.
   Carolyn Smith, vice president of Boston's Cabot Advertising, said
marketing surveys show consumer awareness of the telephone company's
advertising increased more than 58 percent since the campaign was
launched.
   ``We were the first to use this format, but I think it's a
trend,'' she said, adding that New England Telephone has been
contacted by other telephone companies interested in running the
same or similar spots in other parts of the country. MCI and Nissan
have also launched similar campaigns.
   ``It's hard to equate in dollars and cents, but the main reason
you advertise is to increase sales of your product,'' Ms. O'Brien
said. ``We've had a real outpouring of letters and calls and
interest by our subscribers.''

<HEAD>Strike Cuts into Christmas Cheer in Small Logging Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bitter, five-month-old strike at a
sawmill has traumatized a logging town's 1,200 residents, splitting
apart families, friends and union members who find themselves on
opposite sides of a picket line.
   Divisions within the town 55 miles northeast of Seattle have run
deep since 177 Summit Timber Co. mill workers went on strike Aug. 1
after a three-year contract expired and the town's largest employer
hired replacement workers.
   Twenty-three union members also returned to work, while 90 who
once were paid as much as $13 an hour remain on the picket line at
$60 a week. Others have left to find other jobs.
   Friendships in the small town are now measured against which side
of the picket line people are on.
   ``Oh no. Oh no. He's one of them!'' said Gary Ensley, a striking
worker, as he watched a pickup truck drive into the Summit plant.
``He's one of those who went back. His bills caught up with him, and
he started losing things, so he went back. ... I don't like him
anymore.''
   Nancy Stull, 43, a 13-year Summit employee, and her husband, a
22-year mill veteran, walked out together with her two brothers.
   One brother found another job and, with his first paycheck,
bought her $250 worth of groceries, she said. The other, now
referred to as her ``ex-brother,'' crossed the picket line about six
weeks into the walkout.
   When she and her family drive to her parents' home for a
traditional Christmas dinner, she said, ``if my ex-brother is there,
we won't stay. We will just turn around and go home and have our own
dinner.''
   No talks have been scheduled since the last bargaining session
between Summit and Lumber Production and Industrial Workers Union,
Local 2860, ended Sept. 15.
   Strikers say they helped the second-generation, family owned
business through tough times, accepting a 25 percent pay cut in 1982
and another cut in 1984. In the latest contract, according to union
officials, the company wanted to retain a 20 percent pay cut it
instituted in 1986.
   Lloyd Johnson, a union business agent, said the economic issues
could have been worked out, but the strike was called over a company
demand that union membership no longer be mandatory.
   Terry Mullane, Summit personnel manager, said the union struck
after giving the company a take-it-or-leave-it proposal.
   ``The strike is sad. It didn't have to happen,'' Mullane said.
``We were forced to take an action for survival purposes.''
   While the company hired replacements two weeks after the strike
started, union members around the state have rallied to support the
striking workers.
   All the striking families have been ``adopted'' by other
Snohomish County union members, who have provided food and gifts for
the children. Thousands of others around the state also have sent
money, food and toys.
   Linda Morgan said she and her husband, Charles, a seven-year
Summit employee, were given a 20-pound turkey, 10 pounds of
hamburger, about $150 worth of groceries and several presents for
their 6-year-old daughter, Katie.
   ``We have always had extra and been able to give to others. I
guess we have learned to receive, because we sure received last
Saturday,'' she said.
   She said her husband found work at a mill in Alaska, but she
called him home after a month.
   ``I'd rather starve than live like that. It wasn't fair to her
(Katie),'' she said. ``Every time her father would call, she would
get on the phone and say, `When are you coming home, dad?'''

   It wasn't the baby in the manger but the one
frolicking on the grass that stole the show at First Baptist
Church's live nativity scene.
   The female donkey foal, named Star of Bethlehem for the patch of
white on her forehead, was born Wednesday just before the volunteers
who care for the animals arrived at work.
   ``I walked in the shed with a whole bunch of hay for them and
when I dropped it on the ground, I noticed (the mare) was all muddy.
Then I saw the foal,'' said Brenda Kirkley. ``I screamed, `We had
our baby!'''
   ``We knew she was pregnant _ but we didn't think she was that
pregnant,'' said Bobby Roundtree, in charge of the donkeys, camels,
ponies, sheep and a calf used in the elaborate production that
concluded Friday night.
   Most of the animals came from farms in the parish, but the camels
were from a circus in Oklahoma and the ponies, which had been
abandoned on land in Madisonville, were loaned by the St. Tammany
Parish Sheriff's Office.

   A Santa Claus impostor is wanted by Dodge
City police for a Christmas Day holdup.
   A man wearing a Santa Claus suit walked into the Kindsvater Truck
Lines Sunday morning and forced an employee to hand over an
undisclosed amount of money, said police Officer Neil Baltazor.
   ``We don't think there were any reindeer involved,'' Baltazor
said. ``He (Santa) was last seen fleeing the scene on foot.''
   The employee, who was not identified, was slightly injured during
a scuffle, Baltazor said.
   ``I guess it's an appropriate way to disguise, but it takes one
damn sick individual to rob someone on Christmas,'' said Tom
Kindsvater, co-owner of the trucking company.
   The business, which is open 24 hours a day, sells diesel fuel to
truckers. It is owned by Kindsvater and his brother, Dennis
Kindsvater.
   ``Santa Claus seems to have changed his image,'' Kindsvater said.
``We think it was someone who used to work at the place because when
he left he said, `Tell Tom and Dennis Merry Christmas.'''

   When the gifts are gone and the tinsel
tucked away, what do you do with your Christmas tree? Throw it in
the yard and watch it rot? Put it on the curb for the garbage truck?
   This year, the state of Vermont wants residents to do something
different: try recycling.
   The Agency of Natural Resources is sponsoring the $5,000
experiment, under which Vermonters will bring their trees to one of
nine locations. There state and city workers will chop the tree into
chips for use in parks or other landscaping projects.
   ``We're hoping for a positive response, particularly from the
areas where it's more densely populated, where people don't have big
backyards where they can dump their Christmas trees to degrade by
themselves,'' said Connie Leach, the agency's chief of recycling and
resource conservation section.
   Trees that are tossed out with the trash can overload garbage
trucks and landfills, Leach said.
   ``A lot of people throw them away and it's a problem for the
haulers that have packer trucks because if you can imagine a tree
getting into that packing mechanism, it really gets jammed,'' Leach
said.

   Santa must have been flattered but a bit
confused when he made his Christmas Eve visit to Mollie Williford's
home.
   Some 2,000 replicas of himself were waiting for Santa, along with
eight Christmas trees.
   Ms. Williford's home is a virtual Santa Claus museum. Starting in
November, the Santas are brought down in 75 or so boxes from the
attic to take up shelf and tree space in nearly every room on the
first floor.
   ``Santas make me happy,'' Ms. Williford said. ``It's also a
marvelous thing to collect. And they only come out once a year.''
   They are made in all sizes, materials and shapes. They are
diverse with a Henry Ford theme: You can have it in any color, as
long as it's red and white.
   Ms. Williford's first Santa _ a tree ornament _ was bought 30
years ago, when she lived in Wichita Falls, Texas. More than 100
Santas join the collection every year; 50 or 60 of them are gifts.

   The earthquake in Armenia, a plane crash in Britain and the
plague of AIDS were the focus of Christmas messages Sunday, as world
and spiritual leaders called for compassion for those whose holidays
have been shattered by tragedy.
   Driving rain and the Palestinian uprising dissuaded crowds of
tourists from celebrating the holiday in Bethlehem, the hilltop town
where Christ was born. Several hundred pilgrims chanted Mass in the
Church of the Nativity while Israeli soldiers chased stone-throwing
youths in the town's streets.
   Tourists said they still were glad they came to the biblical town
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``We are excited to be here, to see the places we have read about
from childhood through Sunday school and Bible studies,'' said
Charles W. Fleming, director of the Shiloh Baptist Church Senior
Choir in Washington, D.C.
   Pope John Paul II set a tone of compassion for the holiday when
he offered his Christmas wish: that ``science and love'' would find
a cure for the deadly scourge of AIDS.
   ``I invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these
brethren of ours, and, as I assure them of my deep affection, I
exhort scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to find
an effective treatment for this mysterious illness,'' the pope said.
   Speaking to about 70,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square,
the pontiff also appealed for help for survivors of the earthquake
that rocked Soviet Armenia earlier this month, killing an estimated
55,000 people.
   In Armenia, President-elect George Bush's son, John, and
grandson, George, toured the disaster area and then went
room-to-room at a hospital, passing out candy bars and games to
children injured in the quake.
   George, 12, said the Christmas visit was ``better than just
sitting at home and opening presents.''
   Queen Elizabeth II took the unprecedented step of updating her
annual televised Christmas mesage with a radio message comforting
those affected by three recent tragedies: the crash of Pan Am Flight
103, the Soviet quake, and a train crash in London earlier this
month.
   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to those who have been injured
and bereaved and it is my hope that the eternal message of Christmas
will bring some comfort in the hour of sadness,'' the queen said.
   In Lockerbie, where the Pan Am jet crashed, Christmas services
were tinged with grief as relatives of the dead and soldiers still
muddy from searching the wreckage joined townspeople in holiday
prayers.
   ``Father, if you're the God of love why did you let this
happen?,'' asked the Rev. Maurice Taylor at the town's Holy Trinity
Catholic church. ``Why did you allow the destruction of hundreds of
innocent lives?''
   In his Christmas sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie said the string of tragedies had a positive side: ``a new
surge of generosity, new signs of a readiness to give and receive; a
new touching of the hearts of men and women towards those whose
world they share.''
   In South Africa, the family of Nelson Mandela made a brief visit
to the jailed black leader, who spent his 27th consecutive Christmas
in prison.
   In West Germany, Joseph Werner of Setauket, Long Island, spent
Christmas Eve in a solitary vigil on the western side of the Berlin
Wall, distributing small black paper flags in what he said was a
protest against the forced division of many German families.
   Not all celebrations were subdued. In Wales, 72-year-old Ted Nash
raised a glass to herald the birth of his third great-granddaughter
to be born on Christmas Day.
   ``Helen really didn't fancy going to hospital on Christmas Day,''
said the slightly jaded Nash of the new mother. ``But there wasn't
really much she could do about it.''
   ``Luckily it was a very quick birth,'' Nash said.

   A small bomb exploded under a car parked
in a residential district of Syrian-policed west Beirut Sunday,
setting cars on fire and slightly injuring one man, police said.
   A police spokesman said the bomb went off at 6:10 p.m. near the
fire brigade headquarters in the Moslem sector's Tarik Jedideh
district.
   An ambulance evacuated the wounded man to the nearby Makassed
Hospital, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   The explosion set two parked cars on fire, the spokesman said,
adding that firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze.
   An eyewitness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said helmeted
Syrian troops sealed off the blast scene immediately after the
explosion, and some fired their automatic rifles in the air to keep
civilians away.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast, which appeared to
be another in a series of bombings designed to discredit Syria's
role as law enforcers in the Moslem sector of the divided capital.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a
12-year-old Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

   Lt. Gen. William Odom spent much of his
Army career immersed in the Soviet Union, including three years as
head of the supersecret National Security Agency that eavesdrops on
U.S. adversaries.
   In retirement, he's still pursuing his life's interest, writing
scholarly articles, watching the changes in the Soviet Union,
preparing to teach Soviet politics at Yale University and reading
his favorite Russian literature.
   As director of national security studies at the Hudson Institute,
a think tank with offices near Washington, Odom writes on relations
between the Soviet Union's civilian and military leaders, a longtime
expertise that has taken on new urgency because of Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms of the Red Army.
   Odom emerged from bureaucratic shadows into national headlines in
May 1986 when he gruffly warned the news media not to speculate on
details of secrets that former NSA employee Ronald W. Pelton was
convicted of selling to the Soviets.
   Nowadays Odom, whose 34-year Army career included teaching
Russian history at West Point, has a professorial demeanor, lacing
his conversation with scholarly references. But he has not changed
his tough views toward the Soviet Union and is reserving judgment
about whether Gorbachev can hold on.
   ``I am waiting with bated breath to see whether Gorbachev can
make it stick,'' Odom said in an interview. ``The situation as I see
it is that the lines are drawn on the military issue between the
general staff and Gorbachev's reformers.''
   Odom, 56, said that after retiring from the Army and leaving his
job as NSA director last July he has found time to enjoy two of his
favorite Russian writers, Anton Chekhov and Mikhail Zoshchenko.
   As he prepares to begin teaching at Yale in January, he continues
to write scholarly articles, including one for Foreign Policy
magazine on Gorbachev's efforts to reform the Red Army.
   That article attracted attention in the wake of Gorbachev's
announcement on Dec. 7 that he was cutting Soviet forces by about 10
percent and withdrawing 50,000 troops from Eastern Europe.
   Odom's interest in Russia began in 1953 during his third year as
a student at West Point, studying the reforms of Peter the Great
(1672-1725).
   He was assigned to the U.S. 6th Cavalry in West Germany in 1956
when that unit prepared to mobilize during the Hungarian uprising
but stayed put as Soviet tanks crushed the rebellion.
   ``My view of my duty as a second lieutenant was that I was in
Europe to hold up the Iron Curtain and to make sure that it did not
fall on Western Europe,'' Odom said.
   His interest in the Soviet Union grew, and he studied the nation
and the Russian language. In the mid-1960s he spent two years at the
military liaison office in Potsdam, East Germany, where he had a
brief chat with the commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in
Germany.
   ``You have very interesting work. I know what your job is,'' the
Soviet told Odom. ``It is to keep track of the daily activities of
the Soviet Army and report to your headquarters.''
   As a lieutenant colonel, Odom spent a year in Vietnam, working
for the military assistance command on pacification, ``understanding
why it wouldn't work'' and being a secret critic of the U.S. role in
Vietnam.
   ``I was never an enthusiast for the policy there, but for reasons
extraordinarily different from those of most people,'' he said.
   ``At Columbia (University) in graduate school, I learned there
was a Sino-Soviet split, and when I looked at the Eurasian land
mass, it occured to me that it was not in the U.S. interest to
contain China ... but that it was in Soviet interest.
   ``I found it very difficult to explain why we would commit a half
a million troops to suit Soviet foreign policy,'' he said. ``As a
lieutenant colonel, you do not really influence policy ... and I was
not sufficiently naive to be believe that I could.''
   After Vietnam, Odom wrote an article for which he is famous among
Sovietologists, a response to a theory by Rand Corp. analyst Roman
Kolkowicz that Communist Party officials and military officers
``have a conflict relationship.''
   Odom responded by noting that most senior military officers were
also Communist Party members and that although there are some
differences of opinion, party discipline prevails.
   In 1972, still a lieutenant colonel, Odom was assigned to the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow, from which he traveled through each of the
15 Soviet republics, ``staying abreast of the Soviet military. I
spent a lot of time on trains.''
   In 1977, he went to the White House as military aide to Zbigniew
Brzezinski, national security adviser to President Carter. He made
brigadier general in 1980, stayed at the White House into the Reagan
administration, then went to the Pentagon to serve as assistant
chief of the Army staff for intelligence 1981-85.

   President-elect and Mrs. Bush worshipped in a
black Baptist church on Christmas Sunday, blending their voices at
times with a choir singing excerpts from Handel's ``Messiah.''
   ``Beautiful service, just lovely,'' said the vice president as he
left the 19th Street Baptist Church. ``Beautiful music,'' he said.
   Bush and his wife joined with obvious enjoyment as the choir sang
the ringing ``Hallelujah Chorus'' from the Handel work.
   The Rev. Jerry A. Moore, pastor of the church, said he extended
the invitation to Bush at a Christmas party in the vice president's
residence after Bush mentioned he would like to attend the service.
   ``We are delighted that you were able to share this spiritual
occasion with us,'' Moore said from the pulpit. ``May God be with
you and make your joys mount in his name.''
   Earlier, the pastor took note of Bush's presence and said, ``We
pray that he discharge his high office with compassion, vision,
wisdom and strength of high resolve.''
   Mrs. Bush told reporters that her present from the
president-elect ``was just what I asked for'' _ a computerized
dictionary. She didn't explain further, but it was believed she
referred to a hand-held, calculator-size electronic device.
   She said she wanted it ``to spell words for me.''
   Asked what she gave her husband, Mrs. Bush replied: ``A big fat
kiss.''
   The Bushes planned to spend the rest of Christmas day with
members of their family. The vice president leaves Monday for
Beeville in South Texas to hunt on the 10,000-acre Lazy F. Ranch
owned by Houston millionaire Will Farish. Bush has hunted there for
the last 20 years.
   A White House aide said Bush, an Episcopalian, enjoys attending
different churches. This was his third visit to the 19th Street
Baptist Church, which is in a building that once housed a synagogue.
Glass work inside and stonework outside still are decorated with the
Star of David.
   The Bushes attendance at the service was not publicized and the
church was nearly half empty. They were accompanied by Rep. Sonny
Montgomery, D-Miss.

   The PLO will urge the United States to
recognize it as the sole representative of the Palestinians and will
push for an international peace conference in future U.S.-PLO talks,
Palestinian sources said Sunday.
   The PLO Executive Committee met for a second day in Baghdad to
review issues that included the formation of a provisional
Palestinian government and the state of the year-old uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Sources close to the discussions said members of the clandestine
committee organizing the uprising in the occupied territories are
participating in the meetings, but they refused to elaborate.
   No official statements are expected until the meeting's scheduled
end late Monday.
   A Palestinian spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the deliberations Sunday focused on future talks with the United
States.
   Earlier this month, Washington reversed a 13-year ban on contacts
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Talks were held in
Tunis, Tunisia several days later.
   The spokesman said the 15-member executive committee reviewed a
report from members Yasser Abd-Rabboo and Abdullah Hourani on the
talks with the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.
   He said the committee instructed the two to continue the talks,
stressing ``the priority of pushing further the effort to hold an
international conference on the Middle East.''
   Sources close to the talks, who also refused to be named, said
the PLO will urge the United States to recognize it as the sole and
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
   The committee also broached the topic of forming a provisional
government in the occupied territories, the spokesman said, adding
that the issue needed further discussion.
   Two committee members _ Bishop Lia Al-Khouri and Mustafa El-Zibri
of the Marxist-oriented Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine _ did not attend the meetings in Arafat's residence in a
tightly guarded compound on the outskirts of Baghdad.
   Neither absence was officially explained, but El-Zibri has been
sharply critical of Arafat's peace initiative.
   There has been growing opposition by radical Palestinian factions
and some figures within the PLO to Arafat's recognition of Israel
and renunciation of terrorism, both of which were conditions set by
the United States to open a dialogue.
   It is not clear to what extent opposition exists within the
executive committee to Arafat's moves.
   El-Zibri is the PFLP's sole representative on the committee,
which includes three members of Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction,
the largest of the six guerrilla groups in the PLO.
   He declared last week in Damascus, Syria, that Arafat's
recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism ``were only
Arafat's personal opinion and are incompatible'' with resolutions
passed by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, when it declared an independent state last
month.
   ``We will continue to exercise our legitimate rights in
struggling against the occupation by all means available, including
armed struggle,'' El-Zibri said.
   Palestinian dissidents based in Syria warned last week they would
continue ``the armed struggle'' against Israel to thwart Arafat's
peace moves and also would seek to oust him from PLO leadership.
   The United States has said it will break off the dialogue with
the PLO if the group is found to have carried out terrorist attacks.

<TEXT>
   Ten opposition members of Parliament were
dragged from a conference hall on Sunday after they stood on chairs
and complained about policemen taking seats reserved for the
presidium.
   Irwine Ho, secretary-general of the assembly, said the
unprecedented removal was necessary because the politicians were
trying to disrupt the meeting.
   The disruption began when Tsai Shih-yuan of the Democratic
Progressive Party and his colleagues found plain-clothed security
guards sitting in front of them in the assembly hal.
   They yelled that the guards were taking up seats reserved for the
presidium. Standing on their chairs, they shouted that the guards
should leave the hall or they would stop the meeting.
   About 40 policemen ran into the noisy hall, grabbed Tsai and nine
other opposition members and put them in two seperate rooms.
   One of those expelled, Huang Tsao-hui, smashed windows of the
room he was kept in and shouted that the governing Nationalist Party
had arrested them illegally.
   Earlier, opposition members were barred from carrying into the
hall a banner reading ``New President, New Parliament.'' They said
they wanted to challenge President Lee Teng-hui in the meeting to
discuss when all seats in the Parliament can be open to elections.
   The opposition has been urging the retirement of old lawmakers
and assemblymen to clear the way for national elections.
   More than two-thirds of the National Assembly's 894 members were
elected on the Chinese mainland before the Nationalists lost a civil
war to the Communists and fled to Taiwan in 1949.
   The octogenarians have been frozen in office to support the
Nationalists' claim to represent all China.
   Many of the elderly assemblymen have said they would not accept a
proposal that has been put forward under which they would
voluntarily retire and get a pension.

   Snowy owls, a solitary species of beautiful birds
from frozen tundra far to the north, are returning to their winter
home near one of the nation's noisiest airports and one of its most
polluted harbors.
   The unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and
an abundant food supply at the 1,800 acres of open field at Logan
International Airport, said Bradford Blodget, of the state Division
of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   ``Massachusetts is probably one of the best places in the entire
country to see snowy owls,'' Blodget said. ``Probably the largest
concentration in the state is out at Logan.''
   In addition to providing a curious counterpoint to the modern
surroundings, the white birds are doing their part to clean up the
much-maligned Boston Harbor by feasting on the water rats populating
the grasslands between the runways and the water.
   More than 35 of the solitary, 20-inch-long, often brown-specked
owls perched on radio towers and swooped silently out over the water
and runways during their last December-to-March visit.
   Norman Smith, of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, banded 36
snowy owls at Logan for the first time last season. The birds, which
travel individually, start their trek south in November and continue
to migrate until January.
   So far this year, Smith has sighted three birds. The small number
could be part of a migratory pattern, or more birds could come as
the season progresses, he said.
   Smith is the state's snowy owl expert, but he concedes it is
difficult to say what draws them from the quiet desolation of the
tundra in Greenland and northern Canada to the chaotic environment
of the airport.
   ``Nobody really knows why they migrate,'' Smith said. ``Some
people try to correlate it to the drop in the Lemming supply (which
the owls feed on), some try to correlate it to the weather.''
   Smith said he believes it's just a normal migratory pattern that
draws the snowy owls south to the airport, where the noisy planes
don't disturb the birds.
   ``For the most part they ignore them,'' he said. ``Owls have
sensitive hearing, but the jet noise doesn't seem to phase them at
all.''
   The owls go about their lives at the airport much like they would
in the barren expanses of home, with a few extra activities, Smith
said.
   ``They roost primarily on the ground. And they seem to be most
active just before sunset and very active at night,'' Smith said.
   Sometimes they perch amid discarded ramps, buses and structures
rusting in an isolated section of the airfield, and occasionally the
owls venture out to the harbor islands.
   ``In the evenings, I've actually seen them fly to downtown
Boston,'' Smith said, adding that the owls perch on roof tops and
eat the rats scurrying near open dumpsters in alleys.
   Although the noise from the planes doesn't bother the owls, Bob
D'Entremont, an airport employee since 1971 who has watched the
falcons, blue heron and geese that populate Logan, said the airport
is not always safe for the owls _ they often sit on the white lines
of the runways to blend in.
   ``We lose a couple a year. A couple get hit,'' said D'Entremont,
who said he has spotted snowy owls at Logan since 1975.
   Logan is not the only place snowy owls congregate in the United
States. The birds travel along the seaboard and live along marshes
and fields. A large seasonal population can be found at Plum Island
off Newburyport.
   A Logan owl was once tracked to Rhode Island, and John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York reports five or six snowy owls a
year.

   Susan Dzialowy never hesitated. Her husband and
children never had the chance to tell her goodbye.
   The 27-year-old woman died Saturday, only a few hours after
dashing back into her burning home to save her three youngsters,
unaware they had already escaped.
   ``I went for groceries and wasn't gone more than 20 minutes. But
by the time I got back, the only thing I saw was them pulling her
out, her face covered with soot,'' John Dzialowy recalled Sunday.
   ``We were facing a rough Christmas as it was. I was out of work
and we couldn't afford much anyway. ... Nothing seemed to be going
right, and now this,'' he added, his voice cracking.
   ``Lord, I don't know where we go from here.''
   Fire Department spokesman Bill Crowley said officials believe the
fire was caused by a space heater in the family's Southwest Side
apartment. He said a safety glass panel that should have covered the
front of the heater was missing and flames apparently touched off
some items nearby.
   ``Flames and smoke were shooting out windows when firefighters
arrived,'' Crowley said. ``When they learned the mother, who had
escaped OK, had gone back inside, several firefighters went in to
search for her.''
   Mrs. Dzialowy was found beneath a window in the rear bedroom and
firefighters attempted cardio-pulmonary resuscitation at the scene.
She was taken to St. Anthony's Hospital.
   There, the Dzialowy, 31, and his children, Mary, 8, Kristin, 7,
and John Jr., 5, maintained a vigil. Mrs. Dzialowy's mother, Kathy
Kisla, said the children told their mother, ``Mommy, get up. We want
you to come home and have Christmas with us.''
   She never regained consciousness, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Dzialowy said he and his children are staying with his parents in
suburban Palos Hills.
   ``My biggest problem right now is to find a job and scrape
together enough money for a decent burial and a place for us to
live,'' Dzialowy said.
   ``Luck is one thing we never had much of. We were married nine
years, through good and bad,'' he added, ``and we always tried to
stay together as a family. That's why she went back in.''

<HEAD>Vice Premier Says No Way Economic Reform Laws Can be Adopted by
Year's End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice Premier Milos Milosavljevic
warned Sunday that some of the economic reforms before lawmakers
likely will not be passed until the middle of next year, the
official Tanjug news agency said.
   The series of laws to introduce market-oriented reforms are
designed to turn around the faltering economy and bolster Premier
Branko Mikulic's much-criticized Cabinet.
   Yugoslavia's inflation rate _ the highest in Europe _ is running
at close to 300 percent and the country is grappling with a $21
billion debt and rising unemployment.
   This year there have been a record 1,000-plus strikes to demand
higher wages and protest sinking living standards.
   ``Expectations, and even demands, are unrealistic,'' that dozens
of laws regulating the economic reform could be passed before Dec.
31, Tanjug quoted Milosavljevic as saying.
   Yugoslavia's parliament was meeting through the weekend to pass
at least nine laws considered crucial to the reform.
   The rest would be passed by mid-1989, Milosavljevic said.
   Mikulic's government has been harshly criticized for its
unsuccessful anti-inflation policies and failure to halt the
economic decline, leading to speculation that the government may
soon be forced to resign.
   The Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje commented that the inflation rate
``hangs like the sword of Damocles'' over Mikulic's Cabinet.
   Vecernje Novosti Belgrade daily on Saturday charged Mikulic
``sowed unfounded hope that his government would win the battle for
economic reform ... and threw in despair every honest worker who
could no longer cope with the inflation''

   Two French girls held captive for 13
months will be released as a Christmas present to the world's
children, a spokesman for the radical Palestinian kidnappers claimed
Sunday.
   Walid Khaled of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council did not set a
date for the release of Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6.
   The group said they will be freed in response to appeals from
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, chief backer of the organization
headed by terrorist leader Abu Nidal.
   Khaled showed a news conference videotapes of people captured
with the girls, their mother Jacqueline Valente and five Belgians.
They apparently will remain held.
   ``The decision to free them is basically related to the
responsibility of the French (government),'' Khaled said without
elaborating.
   On tape, all the captives said they were well cared for.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council declared Nov. 8, 1987, it had
seized them aboard a French yacht off the Gaza Strip and accused
them of spying for Israel.
   However, Israeli press reports said the yacht was hijacked off
Libya, the group's main base.
   ``We will release the two girls as a Christmas gift for the
children of the world and their family,'' Khaled told reporters at
his office in west Beirut's Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp.
   ``They will be released outside Lebanon. That's why the operation
is taking time,'' Khaled added.
   That raised the possibility they could be freed in Libya or
Algeria, which has offered to host the release.
   Khaled said the other captives were ``in good health and well
treated.''
   The Belgians are Fernand Houtekins, his brother Emmanuel and his
wife Godelieve and their two children, Laurent, 17, and Valerie, 16.
   In the tapes, the six said they were filmed Dec. 20. They started
by giving their names and wishing Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
to relatives and friends. They did not relay any demands of their
kidnappers.
   ``I'm pregnant and in good health. After our release, I intend to
live in another country than France to build up my future there,''
Ms. Valente said.
   Fernand Houtekins referred to Ms. Valente as ``my wife.''
   ``For the second time, my wife is pregnant while we are with the
Palestinian fighters. Everything is proceeding smoothly,'' he said.
   Khaled said last Christmas that Ms. Valente had given birth to a
baby girl after a seven-month pregnancy ``from an illegal
relationship with Fernand Houtekins.''
   Emmanuel Houtekins said the kidnappers were ``providing us with
wine and beer. Our accommodation is good and we have heating. We
have no problems.''
   Mrs. Godelieve Houtekins thanked the Belgian government ``for all
the help exerted to facilitate our release.''
   Valerie Houtekins said she hoped to ``receive letters from
relatives and friends soon.''
   Her brother, Laurent, revealed ``we are all at the same big
apartment.''
   The videotapes were released after Khaled met for an hour with
Ms. Valente's mother, Brigitte Valente, her former husband Pascal
Betille and brother-in-law Andre Metral, who are in Beirut to
negotiate the release.

<HEAD>12 Extremists Killed In Ethnic Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramilitary forces killed 12 Sinhalese
extremists just hours after anti-government militants raided a tea
plantation and set fire to 10 Tamil homes, police said Sunday.
   It was the worst burst of violence since Prime Minister
Ranasinghe Premadasa was elected president in Dec. 19 elections. He
takes office Jan. 2.
   Premadasa, a Sinhalese, has said his victory would help curb
ethnic violence on this Indian Ocean island, particularly by the
People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group that opposes
the government's peace overtures to the Tamil minority.
   A police spokesman said a group of Sinhalese extremists raided a
tea plantation in Matale on Saturday and torched 10 Tamil homes.
More than 300 other Tamils fled the estate after the attack and
sought refuge in a Hindu temple, according to the police spokesman,
who did not want to be identified. Matale is about 65 miles north of
Colombo.
   Later in the day, members of the People's Revolutionary Red Army
retaliated by killing 12 Sinhalese men in separate attacks in the
southern towns of Hakmana, Wellawaya and Akuressa, the spokesman
said.
   The victims all were members of the front, he said.
   The People's Revolutionary Red Army, comprised mainly of members
of paramilitary forces, has blamed the front for killings of 900
government supporters and security personnel in the past 17 months.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people and say they are denied jobs and education by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population.
   Moderate Tamils have been demanding self-rule in the northern and
eastern provinces, while Tamil extremists wage a guerrilla war for a
separate Tamil homeland. More than 8,500 people have died in the
fighting.
   The People's Liberation Front abhors a peace accord signed in
July 1987 and aimed at ending the 5-year-old Tamil insurgency. The
front contends the government granted too many concessions by
offering limited automony to the Tamils.

   A multimillion-dollar Soviet space probe hurtling
toward Mars apparently is having serious mechanical problems that
could cause a severe setback for the Soviet space program, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``There is enough smoke that I suspect there is a little fire,''
said Sam Keller, deputy associate administrator for space science
and applications for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``You can't tell how serious it is, but there is no question they
are having problems,'' Keller told the Houston Chronicle. ``In
recent years they have had a history of (planetary) missions that
did not work.''
   Four months ago, word leaked that the Soviet Union lost Phobos I,
the first of the twin, unmanned Mars probes, because of a computer
problem.
   Phobos I and Phobos II were launched in July. They were scheduled
to orbit Mars January 29 and then begin circling Phobos in May or
April, bombarding the little moon's pitted surface with laser and
particle beams. They also were to deploy landers on Phobos to
perform chemical and physical tests of the surface.
   ``What I have heard is that some of the Phobos II instruments
allegedly have failed,'' Keller said. ``How critical the problem is,
I don't know.
   ``My guess is that they are trying right now to figure our their
situation,'' said Keller, who has worked closely with the Soviets
and their planetary space program.
   Another knowledgeable source told the newspaper ``there is no
prospect of any science data return'' from Phobos II and that it was
common knowledge among some U.S. scientists familiar with the Phobos
II problem.
   If true, that would be the end of a billion-dollar experiment,
the most ambitious of the Soviet Union's planetary science probes
paving the way toward eventual exploration of Mars.

   Police on Sunday questioned four prisoners
and three guards suspected of helping stage a prison riot that left
24 people dead, officials said.
   They also were searching for two men who reportedly smuggled guns
into the prison by posing as lawyers, said state government
spokesman Francisco Flores.
   Ernesti Medina, assistant director of criminal investigation,
said police were questioning all the prison guards Sunday about the
events that began Thursday morning with a shootout in which the
warden was killed and ended Friday night in a bloody commando
storming of the building.
   All those injured _ three hostages, two prisoners and a guard _
were released from the hospital Saturday, Medina said.
   Flores said police Friday night arrested four inmates and three
prison guards, including the one who was injured. The inmates were
found in the prison's administrative offices during the rescue
operation, he said.
   Other hostages escaped unharmed.
   According to officials, the uprising was begun Thursday when
hundreds of relatives were visiting at the prison by six prisoners
mutinying because they were denied pardons given at Christmas to
those with good behavior.
   Helped by two well-dressed armed visitors, the inmates took over
warden Samuel Alvarado's office with 21 hostages. Alvarado, 31, was
shot in the leg and apparently bled to death.
   Special commando forces were flown in from Mexico City, 500 miles
southeast of the Venustiano Carranza penitentiary.
   Commando chief Jorge Armando Duarte was shot shortly before
nightfall Friday, when he went into the prison compound and tried to
talk the inmates into surrendering. ``The answer was a hail of
bullets which killed him instantly,'' said a state official.
   About two hours later, police lobbed dozens of tear gas canisters
into the penitentiary and rushed it with automatic weapons blazing.
An undetermined number of people died in the raid, which was
unsuccessful.
   About 11 p.m. Friday the commandos staged a second raid, which
killed more people and succeeded.
   At least two people besides the prison warden and commando leader
were killed before special forces stormed the inmates.
   The toll includes 19 prisoners and three unidentified people
presumed to be prisoners.
   The prsion's other 1,200 inmates remained under control
throughout the uprising.

<HEAD>President Warns Shiites To Stop Fighting, Meets Cleric Rumored

<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei on Sunday warned
Shiite Moslem militiamen in Lebanon to stop fighting, saying they
should unify against the United States and Israel, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   ``The Lebanese have a common enemy and should consolidate their
ranks against imperialism, Zionism and their mercenaries by
strengthening the Islamic aspects they share,'' said Khamenei,
according to the report monitored in Cyprus.
   The Iranian president made his remarks after meeting with the
acting chairman of the Lebanese Higher Supreme Shiite Council, Sheik
Mohammad Mehdi Shamseddine, the agency said.
   Shamseddine, the senior cleric on the council, has been on a
visit to Iran since early December. He arrived in Tehran just after
a bloody round of fighting between Lebanon's two main Shiite
militias to brief Khamenei on the latest developments in Lebanon,
the Iranian news agency said.
   The mainstream Amal militia, supported by Syria, has been
fighting the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, for control of
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites. Six days of fighting in Moslem west
Beirut last month left 40 people dead and 87 wounded, by police
count.
   Press reports in Lebanon have speculated that Shamseddine was
under house arrest in Iran because of what was termed his
``unexplained delay there.''
   The Lebanese weekly magazine, Ash-Shiraa, said in its latest
edition on Friday that the cleric's family and friends were worried
because he was scheduled to spend only one week in Iran.
   Amal and the Lebanese government consider Shamseddine the highest
Shiite religious authority in Lebanon. Hezbollah, the umbrella group
for many Shiite factions, does not recognize the authority of
Shamseddine and deals directly with Iran.
   Hezbollah has been trying to take over the highest post in the
council, which has been vacant since the disappearence of its
chairman, Imam Musa Sadr, during a visit to Libya in 1978.

   Surrealist painter Salvador Dali returned
home on Christmas Day after being hospitalized for three days with
an intestinal lesion, doctors said.
   Dr. Carles Punsati said the 84-year-old artist was released from
Figueras Hospital because his condition had improved.
   Dali was rushed to the hospital on Thursday after vomiting blood
that came from the small lesion.
   Dr. Juan Garcia San Miguel said Sunday that the painter's health
is good, despite his age and other ailments.
   It was the second time in a month that Dali has been hospitalized.
   On Nov. 27, he entered Figueras Hospital for treatment of
pneumonia. The next day, he was rushed to Quiron Clinic in Barcelona
because of severe heart trouble aggravated by blood clots in his
left lung. He was released Dec. 14.
   The flamboyant artist, a founding member of the surrealist
movement, is the last of an outstanding generation of Spanish
painters that included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan
Miro, who died a decade later.
   Dali has been in poor health and bound to a wheelchair since
1984, when he was severly burned in a fire at his home. Since then,
he has lived in seclusion, fed by a nasal tube and watched
round-the-clock by a team of nurses. In 1986, Dali underwent surgery
to receive a heart pacemaker.

   Actress Melanie Griffith, who plays a corporate
Cinderella in ``Working Girl,'' said she quickly identified with her
movie character, struggling secretary Tess McGill.
   As the star of Mike Nichols' comic fable about getting ahead, Ms.
Griffith, 31, plays a street-smart secretary who battles sexism,
class prejudice and an unscrupulous boss to climb the Wall Street
ladder.
   When considering the part, she concluded, ``OK, I'm going to do
this part because I know I can,'' Ms. Griffith recalled in the Jan.
2 issue of Newsweek.
   ``That's what Tess did, and that's what I feel I've done _
against everybody saying, `Oh, you're just a sexpot or a nymphet.'
Or, `You're a problem, you drink too much, you do drugs.' Or,
`You're wild.'''
   Ms. Griffith told the magazine she has been working hard to shed
her party girl image. She also has been battling the bottle. She was
still drinking during filming of ``Working Girl,'' but underwent
rehabilitation at the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota in May.
   Ms. Griffith, daughter of actress Tippi Hedren, also has appeared
in the films ``Night Moves,'' ``Body Double,'' ``Something Wild''
and ``Stormy Monday.''

   Christmas passed quietly for the homeless
survivors of a tornado that killed one person, injured 15 others and
destroyed 20 buildings as it swirled through two Nashville suburbs.
   While most survivors sought shelter with families and friends,
others accepted free refuge from local hotels.
   ``Many of them seemed very appreciative,'' said Lisa Jezwinski, a
desk clerk at Holiday Inn, where several of the survivors spent the
night.
   Bob Bissinger, an Atlanta tool dealer, was visiting his parents
at their Brentwood home when the tornado hit, but missed the
twister's destruction.
   ``This is the best Christmas present of all,'' Bissinger said.
``We're alive.''
   Mike Thompson, emergency management director for Williamson
County, estimated damage to houses at $3 million. Gov. Ned McWherter
sent state troopers and others to the area to prevent looting.
   Sheriff's deputies patrolled homes as officials tried to restore
electricity and phone lines.
   ``They still haven't finished assessing the damages, so I don't
know when the cleanup is set to begin,'' said deputy Bill Poole.
``We have provided extra security for the subdivisions.''
   The twister destroyed 20 buildings in its three-mile-long path
just after dawn Saturday. As many as eight tornadoes were reported,
but only one tornado caused the destruction in Franklin and
neighboring Brentwood, officials said.
   A tornado hitting in December is unusual, officials at the
National Weather Service said.
   ``Tornadoes are not completely out of the question during the
wintertime, but they are uncommon,'' said meteorologist Doug
Boyette. The weather service often issues tornado watches but they
say the twisters rarely materalize.
   Not a single piece of furniture remained intact in Hardy
Britton's home, but he and his two daughters were uninjured.
   The tornado pulled Britton's wife through a broken window of
their frame house and hurled her at least 20 yards into an open
field, but she suffered only minor injuries. The Brittons spent the
night with family.
   Ernest Rice, 67, was killed by the twister. Fifteen people were
taken to Williamson Medical Center, south of Nashville. All were
treated and released, except one woman who was listed in stable
condition Sunday, nursing supervisor Sherry Young said.

<HEAD>Afghan Resistance Leader Meets Iranian President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afghan resistance leader visiting Iran
to consult Afghan Shiite groups met Sunday with President Ali
Khamenei, who expressed hope for an Islamic government in
Afghanistan, Iranian news media reported.
   The visit to Tehran by resistance leader Burhanuddin Rabbani,
head of the Sunni Moslem Afghan alliance based in Pakistan, follows
Moscow's decision earlier this month to hold separate talks with
Afghan Shiite Moslems.
   Rabbani, whose group met for talks in Saudi Arabia with Soviet
officials, denounced Moscow's decision at the time, saying the
opening of a dialogue with two separate alliances would lead to
conflict and division in the decision-making process.
   Both alliances are fighting the Afghan government in Kabul that
is backed by thousands of Soviet troops.
   In his meeting with Rabbani, Khamenei said he hoped the
mujahedeen, as the resistance groups are called, will succeed in
establishing an Islamic government, said the official Islamic
Republic News Agency monitored in Nicosia.
   Earlier Iranian press reports quoted Rabbani as saying he was in
Tehran to consult with the Shiite alliance based in Iran in order to
determine the future of Afghanistan after the Soviet troop
withdrawal scheduled to end Feb. 15, 1989.
   Mohammad Javad Larijani, Iranian deputy foreign minister, on
Sunday expressed support for the talks between the Soviet Union and
the Afghan resistance, IRNA said.
   IRNA said Afghan refugees in Iran planned to stage a rally
Tuesday to mark the ninth anniversary of the Soviet military
intervention in support of the Marxist government in Kabul.
   In Rome Saturday, a top Soviet official held talks for the first
time with Mohammad Zaher Shah, former king of Afghanistan, who has
been mentioned as playing a possible role in a peace settlement,
officials said. The mujahedeen are opposed to any role for the king,
who has lived in Rome since his 1973 overthrow.
   Yuli Vorontsov, a first deputy Soviet foreign minister, said the
talks with the exiled king focused on a proposal for convening a
council in Afghanistan of 50 to 60 politicians or prominent
individuals to create a new government.
   More than 100,000 Soviet troops were deployed in Afghanistan
after December 1979 when they intervened to to back up a
Soviet-supported government. Moscow has delayed their scheduled
withdrawal, citing repeated guerrilla attacks. The mujahedeen were
not party to the withdrawal agreement signed in April in Geneva.

   Iran, Iraq and Syria rallied behind Libya
Sunday after the United States said it was considering destroying an
alleged chemical weapons plant in Libya.
   The Arab League scheduled a meeting Monday to discuss the issue,
according to an official Iraqi report.
   President Reagan said Thursday the United States and its allies
are considering using military force against a factory in Libya that
he said produces chemical weapons.
   The United States bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for a
terrorist attack on a Berlin disco that left a U.S. serviceman dead
and 204 other people wounded.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday denied Libya built a
chemical weapons plant and said the country was committed to U.N.
efforts to ban such weapons. Libya has said the plant manufactures
pharmaceuticals.
   In Iran, Tehran radio on Sunday quoted Deputy Foreign Minister
Hosseyn Sheykholeslam as saying his government supports Libya and
will take a ``firm stand in the face of America's threats and
propaganda attacks.''
   The official Syrian news agency SANA quoted an unidentified
government official as saying, ``Syria expresses its deep concern
and strong denunciation as to this unjustified campaign against
Libya.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency, INA, said Iraq agreed to
participate in the extraordinary session of the 22-member-nation
Arab League called by its secretary-general, Chedli Klibi.
   Libya asked for the meeting after Reagan made his threat, it said.
   ``By shouting these threats against the Libyan people, the
American administration is trying to impose the logic of terrorism
and aggression in solving bilateral and international issues,'' the
government-owned daily Al-Joumhouriya said in an editorial.
   Tehran radio criticized the United States for its failure to act
against Iraq, which earlier this year used chemical weapons against
its own dissident Kurdish minority.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran supported Kurdish guerrillas
fighting for autonomy. Iraq started an offensive against Kurds soon
after Iran agreed to a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war in August.
   
   About 5,000 Kurdish civilians in the northeastern Iraqi town of
Halabja were killed by the chemicals.
   ``If the American government is really concerned about the
production of chemical weapons, why did it not react to the repeated
use of these weapons, especially by the Iraqi regime?'' Tehran radio
asked.

   In another sign that this South
American country is forsaking its leftist and anti-U.S. past,
domestic reports said Guyana has invited U.S. soldiers to drill for
water and help eradicate malaria next year.
   The state-owned Guyana Chronicle said in its weekend edition that
an advance contingent of senior U.S. Army officers from the
Panama-based Southern Command will arrive in Georgetown early next
month to complete details of the projects.
   Guyanese and U.S. Army officials held talks in July on U.S. aid
in drilling wells along Guyana's 235-mile coast and help in
eradicating malaria.
   The U.S. soldiers will also conduct dental clinics and treat
Guyanese for intestinal and skin diseases, the newspaper said.
   Defense Department spokesman William Caldwell said Sunday he knew
nothing of the projects. However, he said the holidays may have
delayed his notification.
   The aid project with U.S. soldiers contrasts sharply with the
anti-U.S. and socialist rhetoric of the 1970s and early 1980s under
late President Forbes Burnham.
   Relations have improved since President Desmond Hoyte took office
after Burnham's death in 1985. In September, Hoyte made a 12-day
trip to Washington.
   The governing People's National Congress has veered to the right
since Hoyte took over. He has encouraged foreign investment and
private enterprise in this finance-starved former British colony on
the northeast coast of South America.
   Opposition parties, led by the Marxist People's Progressive
Party, have called the projects with U.S. soldiers a violation of
Guyana's sovereignty.

   Communist rebels Sunday released six
soldiers captured in two separate September raids and predicted the
``total victory'' of their revolution within the next decade.
   Euclides Abcede, a former mayor who negotiated the release, said
the six sergeants were freed in Malinao village, about 70 miles
southeast of Manila.
   He said they were in good condition. Soldiers took the six to
Lucena City, 20 miles west of the release point, where they were
reunited with their families, he said.
   The freed men included five members of an engineering battalion
who were abducted Sept. 25 in Atimonan town where they were to
deliver the unit payroll. The sixth soldier, a Philippine
constabulary sergeant, was captured in a raid three days later on
the town of San Andres.
   Abcede said the army kept relatives of those freed away from the
release point, apparently to play down the affair.
   Last August, rebels in the same province freed four lieutenants
and a sergeant after protracted negotiations which were widely
reported in the Manila press. Their release ceremony won lots of
publicity and relatives of the freed soldiers were quoted last
August as expressing gratitude and admiration for the rebel New
People's Army.
   Military officials later complained the press had given the
insurgents a propaganda victory.
   The central committee of the banned Communist Party of the
Philippines on Sunday predicted victory within the next decade ``so
long as no grave errors of ideological subjectivism, political
opportunism, sectarianism and laxity are committed.''
   ``In twenty years of existence, the party remains at the center
of the national political stage, no matter how the United States and
its reactionary agents try to marginalize it through violence and
deception,'' the committee said in a statement on the eve of the
20th anniversary of the founding of the Maoist party. ``There is no
way the United States can defeat a resolute, protracted people's war
in the Philippines.''
   The statement claimed the party had grown from 60 ``red
fighters'' on Dec. 26, 1968, to 35,000 full time members and a
10-million-strong ``mass base,'' or sympathizers, operating in 63 of
the 73 provinces.

   A high-ranking Roman Catholic
leader called on leftist rebels Sunday to give up car bombings in
their war against the government because the blasts have killed
civilians.
   Rebels set off four car bombs Friday near the heavily-fortified
Defense Ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff headquarters in San
Salvador during one of their most dramatic attacks in the 9-year-old
conflict. They also launched bombs by catapult over the 20-foot-high
walls.
   Three people, all civilians, were killed and 38 wounded in the
attack.
   ``We characterize the attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a
terrorist act because all the victims were civilians,'' Mons.
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary archbishop of San Salvador, said
Sunday.
   ``Since the first use of car bombs (in April), the church raised
its voice to denounce it as a negative development because it raised
the level of danger for the civilian population,'' he told reporters
at the capital's Catholic cathedral after a morning Christmas Mass.
   ``We believe it is an unjustifiable form of war and that it must
stop,'' he said.
   Rebels have detonated at least nine car bombs this year. The
rebels say the latest attack showed their strength, but the military
says the terrorist tactics by the rebels demonstrate their weakness.

   One lucky Lotto player received a Christmas Eve
gift that will go on giving for many Christmases to come _ $37
million spread out in 20 annual payments, state lottery officials
said Sunday.
   But the identity of the winner of the third largest grand prize
ever awarded in the Illinois lottery could remain a mystery for a
day or two, said lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem. State officials have
to certify the winning ticket, and they don't go back to work until
Tuesday, Ms. Rem said.
   The huge payout is the result of three previous weekend drawings
without any player matching all six numbers drawn from among 54
possible. The state lottery guarantees $5 million for each weekend
drawing and rolls that amount over.
   Strong ticket sales added an extra $17 million to the pot to push
the total to $37 million, Ms. Rem said.
   The prize is the fifth largest ever in the United States to go to
a single ticket buyer. The biggest winner is Sheelah Ryan of Winter
Springs, Fla., who won $55.16 million in the Florida lottery in
September.
   Former printer Mike Wittkowski won the largest-ever Illinois
lottery prize of $40 million four years ago.
   Saturday's winning numbers were eight, nine, 27, 33, 43 and 54.
   In addition to the one big winner, 539 players correctly matched
five of six numbers to win $2,365 each, and nearly 32,000 players
matched four to win $80, officials said.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Charges against nine soldiers
accused of fomenting an October coup attempt were dropped and four
of them who had been jailed were released Sunday, the government
said.
   One of the four soldiers released Sunday, Sgt. Frantz Beauchard,
was accused of being the plot's instigator. The five other accused
soldiers are believed to have been in hiding since October.
   ``The President of the Republic, by this act of clemency towards
these former members of the Haitian Armed Forces, again shows his
firm will to safeguard peace, love, and harmony among all Haitian
families,'' said a release signed by Information Minister Antony
Saint-Pierre and read by state televison on Christmas day.
   On Wednesday the government released 12 other soldiers jailed for
their part in the alleged coup attempt, saying they had been
hoodwinked by the nine leaders of the plot. The 12 released
Wednesday and the four released Sunday had been jailed since
mid-October.
   The 21 soldiers have been discharged from the army.
   Rank-and-file troops, fed up with state-sponsored violence,
ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17 and replaced
him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. The soldiers, who also ousted
nearly 60 unpopular officers, demanded a return to democracy and
respect for human rights.
   Several leftist groups, as well as the 12 soldiers released
Wednesday, claimed the soldiers' arrest in October was aimed at
purging the army of its most progressive elements responsible for
leading the Sept. 17 rebellion rather than foiling an attempted coup.
   Namphy had come to power in 1986 when former dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to exile in France.

   A winter storm that dumped snow on much of the West edged toward
the northern Plains on Sunday, promising more snow and wind-chills
as low as 55 degrees below zero. Meanwhile, the East basked in
relatively mild temperatures and parts of Southern California were
drenched.
   A heavy snow warning was posted for the southwest mountains of
Colorado, where in Purgatory, 17 inches of new snow fell by midday
Sunday. Gothic had 15 inches and Wolf Creek received 14 inches.
   Winter storm warnings were posted for much of northern Arizona,
all of Utah, and south central Montana. Clarkston, Utah, received 14
inches of snow.
   As the western storm moved eastward, the Dakotas braced for heavy
snow and strong winds, with wind chills expected to drop as low as
55 degrees below zero Monday.
   The storm brought heavy rain in Southern California on Saturday
night and early Sunday. One site in northern San Diego County got 3}
inches of rain.
   But Christmas Day was mild in the East. Temperatures warmed into
the 80s in Florida, in the 60s in southern Virginia and the 50s in
New York City.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 0.29 inch at Crescent City, Calif., 0.17 inch at Corpus
Christi, Texas, and 0.15 inch at Salinas, Calif. Heavier snowfall
during the same period included 3 inches at Ely, Nev., and Hill Air
Force Base, Utah, and 2 inches at Pocatello, Idaho.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Thief River Falls, Minn., and Williston, N.D.,
to 85 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   Monday's forecast called for snow through the northern Plains and
upper Mississippi Valley, the Rockies and intermountain West;
scattered snow through Michigan; freezing rain and snow through
southern Wisconsin and Iowa; rain from northern Kansas across
Missouri to much of Illinois; rain scattered from Southern
California through the desert Southwest, southern New Mexico and the
southern Plains to Arkansas and western Louisiana; and a few
thunderstorms in the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast around zero over northern
Montana; in the single digits and teens from the intermountain West
through the northern Rockies and the Dakotas to much of Minnesota;
in the 20s and 30s from the Pacific Northwest through much of the
intermountain West, the central Rockies, Nebraska, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio Valley
to the northern Atlantic coast; the 60s and 70s from the south
Atlantic coastal states through the Gulf Coast states to much of
Texas; and in the 40s and 50s across the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Two Half Brothers Meet For First Time At Gift-Wrapping Counter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two half brothers who had never seen
each other but look ``enough alike ... to be twins'' got a stunning
surprise when they met by chance at a gift-wrapping counter.
   ``We've got a lot of catching up to do. I think it's just
fantastic,'' said Talford Handson, 31, who met his half brother,
Curtis Handson, 36, at the Indian Springs Shopping Center. Both live
in Kansas City, Kan.
   ``He was getting a gift wrapped, and I was getting a gift
wrapped, and the two guys were taking our names basically at the
same time,'' Talford Handson said.
   ``Our name is very unusual, so that kind of clicked right there,
and we got together and started talking. Here it is Christmas, and
I've never seen him before in my life,'' he said.
   Talford Handson said he was born in Kansas City to Hubert Handson
and Darlene Haywood Handson. The couple divorced in 1958, and at age
3 he moved with his mother to Pasadena, Calif., where he was raised.
He returned to the Kansas City area about 10 years ago and works as
a machinist.
   Talford said he knew he had half siblings from his father's
previous marriage, but that he had never met them. Besides Curtis,
he has two other half brothers and four half sisters, he said.
   Curtis Handson, a church maintenance worker in Prairie Village,
said he had no idea he had a half brother he had not met.
   Irving Schlossenberg, a volunteer gift-wrapper at the mall, said
the two men ``looked enough alike, believe it or not, to be twins.''

   Soldiers and volunteers spent
Christmas scouring the countryside for clues and victims from Pan Am
Flight 103, taking a break from the grim search to join saddened
townspeople at somber church services.
   No more bodies were found Sunday as dismal weather grounded
search helicopters, said Deputy Chief Constable Paul Newall.
Continual drizzle combined with low-lying clouds to reduce
visibility.
   ``Lots of our people are getting fairly tired,'' he said. He said
some search dogs were retired for the day ``because dogs don't go on
as well as human beings.
   ``We still have areas that are almost impregnable,'' Newall said,
referring to the wooded and hilly terrain. But he said the search
area had been extended about 15 miles east of Lockerbie.
   Sixty-one relatives of victims, most of them Americans, were in
Lockerbie on Christmas Day, said Leslie Jardine, spokesman for
social workers in the town. Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said some
were taken to the search areas.
   No bodies have been positively identified, and police were unable
to tell relatives when bodies might be available for burial.
   Police said 239 bodies had been brought to temporary morgues so
far, including 84 on Christmas Eve. There were 258 people aboard the
Pan Am flight, which originated in Frankfurt, with a change of
planes before heading on to New York.
   Police still have not accounted for 10 townspeople and the
occupants of two cars destroyed by wreckage that rained on the area
during Wednesday night's crash. Police said Sunday the driver of one
of the cars was identified as a Yorkshire man driving a company car.
   Two U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press on Saturday that the CIA's
chief in Beirut had been among the jet's passengers. But that was
denied in Washington on Sunday by Oliver Revell, the FBI's executive
assistant director.
   ``We cannot comment on intelligence community personnel, but I am
authorized to say that the station chief in Beirut was not on that
aircraft,'' he said in an interview with CBS Radio.
   During a church service on Sunday in Lockerbie, the Roman
Catholic bishop of Galloway, the Rev. Maurice Taylor, brought a
message that Jesus Christ ``is alive today in this town and in the
hearts of the people.''
   Two pews were reserved at the Holy Trinity Roman Catholic church
for relatives of crash victims who had come from the United States.
   At All Saints Church, a small Anglican parish, two relatives
stood silently while the congregation sang, ``O Come All Ye
Faithful.'' The Rev. Alan Neal, parish rector, said the two were a
father and a son who both lost wives in the crash.
   The strain of the disaster, and the attention it has brought to a
quiet corner of southwestern Scotland, began to show Sunday. Police
admitted only parishioners and relatives of the dead to Mass,
keeping reporters and cameras in a cluster across the street.
   On a day traditionally devoted to celebrating the Nativity,
sermons turned to thoughts of death _ and why such disasters occur.
   ``Father, if you're the God of love why did you let this
happen?,'' asked Taylor. ``Why did you allow the destruction of
hundreds of innocent lives? The 10 who were citizens of Lockerbie?
The many dozens who had never heard of Lockerbie, but whose lives
ended so appallingly in the streets and fields of this part of
Scotland?
   ``And why do you permit so many people to have to suffer the
cruel tragic burden of bereavement? The answers to these questions _
how to make sense of the pieces of this seemingly senseless jigsaw _
God alone knows,'' he said.
   Taylor's words were echoed by the Rev. Derek Rawcliffe, the
Anglican bishop of Glasgow and Galway, who preached at All Saints
Church.
   ``I don't know (why). But one thing I do know,'' he said. ``My
response ... must be love to all the victims, and love shown in a
practical way.''
   If it turns out that the plane was brought down by saboteurs,
Rawcliffe said, ``then we have to do the difficult task of forgiving
them.''
   Authorities have said that a bomb or structural failure are the
most likely causes, but investigators from Britain and the United
States have reached no conclusion. The jumbo jet apparently broke up
at 31,000 feet, showing flaming debris over the Scottish countryside.
   Soldiers, most dressed in fatigues and muddy boots, filled three
rows of the small church.
   For most of the army and Royal Air Force personnel in Lockerbie,
there was a lunch break for turkey soup, turkey, mince pie and _ if
they wanted it _ a can of beer.
   Isabelle Robertson of the Women's Royal Volunteer Service said it
had been a sad Christmas dinner for ``a lot of very tired young men
who have seen dreadful things.''

<HEAD>Three Abortion Clinics Damaged In Christmas Blazes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suspicious fires broke out at three abortion
clinics in less than an hour early Christmas morning, leading clinic
directors to blame anti-abortion activists for the damage.
   The Dallas Fire Department responded to blazes at North Dallas
Women's Clinic, the Fairmount Center Clinic and A to Z Women's
Health Services Sunday morning, Capt. Mike Southerland said.
   The causes of the fires remained under investigation, but
Southerland said arson is suspected.
   ``They are suspicious,'' Southerland said. ``Very possibly a
flammable liquid (was) involved.'' Damage was described as minor,
and there were no injuries.
   Dena Jackson, director of clinic operations for North Dallas
Women's Clinic, said someone apparently spread flammable liquid on
the carpet in the clinic's reception area then set it afire.
   Ms. Jackson said she does not know who set the fire, but ``I feel
that it goes right along with the rest of the anti-abortion violence
throughout the United States.''
   But officials at Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group that
protested at the North Dallas clinic Dec. 17, disagreed.
   Flip Benham, a spokesman for Dallas Rescue, the local chapter of
Operation Rescue, said he had not heard of the Christmas morning
fires at the clinics and said his organization would never resort to
such tactics.
   ``This is the first information that I have on it,'' Benham said.
``I am very saddened to hear that.''But he vowed that the group's
protests would continue.
   Betty Pettigrew, director of A to Z Women's Health Services, said
she believes also anti-abortion activists are responsible for the
damage to her clinic.
   ``We feel like we know who it is,'' Ms. Pettigrew said. ``They're
always threatening it, and we had heard that some clinic was going
to be hit _ not necessarily in Dallas.''
   She said fire investigators told her a five-gallon fuel can was
found near the entrance of the clinic and kerosene was poured in and
around the door to start the blaze.
   The fire at North Dallas clinic was reported shortly before 1
a.m., while reports of fires at the other two centers came about
1:30 a.m., Southerland said. All blazes were out before 2 a.m. and
none of the clinics sustained heavy damage, he said. No damage
estimates were made by clinic officials.
   Neither the North Dallas Women's Clinic nor A to Z Women's Health
Services will close because of the fires, the directors said. Ms.
Jackson said patients at her center will be cared for elsewhere this
week, but some office work will continue at the clinic.
   Officials of Fairmount Center Clinic did not immediately return
telehone calls.

   A car carrying a family to a Christmas Eve
celebration swerved into the path of a dump truck, killing seven
people and scattering presents across the road, authorities said.
   None of the seven victims was wearing a seat belt when the
accident occurred Saturday, but the force of the impact was so
great, belts probably wouldn't have saved their lives anyway,
according to Starke County Coroner Douglas E. O'Donnell.
   ``From my observation, there was no way to help any of them,'' he
said.
   ``This has got to be one of the most tragic traffic accidents
ever in Starke County,'' he said. ``It's been a real tragic year for
a small county like ours. It's bad enough to have a tragedy like
this, let alone on a holiday, and with a whole family (killed), it
is pretty bad.''
   Six members of the Davis family of Knox and the girlfriend of one
of the six were pronounced dead at the scene. Their car veered into
the path of the dump truck when they tried to avoid a car that had
slowed down to make a turn, authorities said. The driver of the
truck received minor injuries.
   Weather was not believed to be a factor in the crash, authorities
said.
   The victims were identified as Floyd Davis, 25, the driver of the
car; Rosalind Davis, 24, his wife; Jesse Davis, 17, his brother;
Gloria Davis, 46, his mother; Crystal Davis, 6, and Carl James
Davis, 3, his stepchildren; and Laura Cites, 25, Jesse Davis'
girlfriend.
   O'Donnell said the family was headed to a celebration at a
relative's home near North Judson, and several Christmas presents
were scattered throughout the crash site southwest of Knox.

   Inmates in the ``desperately
overcrowded'' Hall County jail rioted to make sure officials knew
how miserable they were, the sheriff said Sunday.
   ``Basically they were saying, `If we can't be home for Christmas
with our families, you won't be home with yours,''' Sheriff Dick
Mecum said after the Saturday night disturbance, which caused no
injuries but did extensive damage to the maximum security cellblock.
   Authorities calmed the prisoners within three hours and
transferred about 70 rioters to another north Georgia prison,
lowering the population in the Hall jail to 175. It was designed to
hold only 145.
   Mecum said the riot began about 8:30 p.m., when inmates began
burning mattresses, blankets and other flammable items in their
cells. Electrical and duct work in the ceilings was vandalized, and
some windows were broken.
   Mecum said the worst damage occurred in the maximum security
block, but some rioting spilled over into another block.
   Authorities went in first with the Hall County SWAT team, Mecum
said, and by 11 or 11:30 p.m., the last of the prisoners had given
up.
   Hall County administrator Mike Bryant said it was too early to
give a damage estimate.
   Coincidentally, Mecum wrote a guest column for the Sunday
editions of Gainesville's daily newspaper, The Times, taking the
state Department of Corrections to task for allowing prisons and
jails to become dangerously overcrowded. Like many county jails in
the state, the Hall jail houses many inmates for whom there is no
room in state prisons.
   ``County jails are desperately overcrowded every day, faced with
riots, fights, injuries and near loss of control of our individual
county facilities,'' Mecum wrote.

<TEXT>
   Some of the 12,000 spectators
shouted ``Go get 'em, George!'' as the flotilla of boats crossed the
Delaware River Sunday to re-enact George Washington's famed
Christmas crossing.
   The crowd offered an enthusiastic contrast to the stately James
Gallagher, who portrayed the ``father of his country'' with his red
and blue cape fluttering in the wind and his white wig and
three-cornered hat highlighted by the sun.
   Wearing a colonial uniform of blue and buff, Gallagher stood
erect in a 40-foot Durham Boat in Sunday's annual commemoration of
the Revolutionary War general's famous crossing.
   Gallagher looked like the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze
that re-created that day 212 years ago. But Sunday's event had more
than 12,000 people watching and cheering.
   ``I must say it was exciting,'' Gallagher said as he was rowed
across from Pennsylvania to New Jersey on a sunny, windswept day
with temperatures more like autumn than winter.
   ``The crowds were exceptionally motivated and greeted George with
lots of remarks like `Go get 'em, George!' and `You look like just
the president,''' said Gallagher, who's planning to ride the boat
again next month in the inaugural parade of President-elect George
Bush.
   The boat will be pulled on a trailer when it is in Washington on
Jan. 20.
   History records that Washington, in the darkness of night and
during a terrible winter storm, crossed the river with 2,400 troops,
200 horses and 18 cannon to surprise British-hired Hessian soldiers
in 1776 for a victory in Trenton that some consider a turning point
in the war for American independence.
   ``He had a miserable night,'' said Gallagher, 60, who was
portraying Washington for the fourth time.
   Gallagher went across with 120 men in four boats and did it in 25
minutes despite a low river that forced cautious rowers to be wary
of rocks protruding from the river bed. The real Washington took
more than nine hours to get his men and equipment across.
   ``It was really exciting to see such a crowd,'' Gallagher said.
``When it's colder there are a lot less people, but the weather was
just beautiful and it made the crossing fabulous.''

   Former University of North Carolina football
star Derrick Fenner was treated Sunday for a gunshot wound he
suffered in an early-morning incident outside a nightclub.
   Fenner was shot in the chest around 4 a.m. Sunday in a parking
lot outside the RSVP nightclub in the southwest section of the city,
police said. He was released after being treated at an area hospital.
   Police said Fenner had become involved in a dispute with several
men inside the club, and they went outside to the parking lot where
a shot was fired.
   The men involved in the altercation fled. No suspect has been
arrested, police said.
   Fenner set an Atlantic Coast Conference record as a sophomore at
North Carolina when he rushed for 329 yards against the University
of Virginia. But his potential was never realized as he soon became
embroiled in several brushes with the law, including a first-degree
murder charge in a drug-related homicide.
   That charge ultimately was dropped, but Fenner remains on
probation as the result of a 1987 incident in which he was stopped
at a traffic light and a police officer found 25 glass vials with
traces of cocaine in his jacket.
   Fenner pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing cocaine and was
sentenced to three years' probation.

<TEXT>
   It has been a deadly year for Southern
California money messengers _ 13 armored car holdups, three possibly
related bank robberies, two slayings and the theft of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   The fatal shooting of an armored car guard during a stop at a
supermarket Dec. 15 was the latest in the rash of heists that have
often occurred during busy daytime hours and frequently ended in
gunfire.
   ``The only time you feel safe is when you're in that truck and
it's for very few minutes until your next stop,'' said Nick
Scarpelli, a guard who quit after a friend at Armored Transport of
California was slain in October.
   The crimes began Dec. 18, 1987, and have involved 13 armored
cars, a bank and two savings and loans in Los Angeles, Riverside and
Ventura counties. Three police departments, two sheriff's
departments and the FBI are investigating.
   The amount stolen in every robbery has not been revealed, but Los
Angeles police Detective Norman Roberge said the total is in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars. In one theft, two gunmen held up a
guard leaving a Universal City theater and took $166,000.
   ``There have been sporadic robberies in recent years past but
none where it's as organized as this; I mean a rash of armored car
robberies in what appears to be a small nucleus of individuals,''
Roberge said Wednesday.
   ``We're looking at them with possibly the same suspects being
involved in some of these robberies,'' he said. ``We're also looking
at avenues where some of these robberies may have been committed by
some imitators.''
   Two men have been arrested for investigation of a June robbery at
a supermarket in Los Angeles, and 29-year-old Steven Bernard Young
was arrested and booked Friday for investigation of robbery in the
armored car probe, police said. A brief police statement issued
Sunday said Young was ``one of the main suspects'' in some of the
heists but gave no details.
   The overall probe continues into what have been unusually
well-planned and violent crimes in which the gunmen have been more
willing than usual to shoot and have not been deterred by the
presence of bystanders, police said.
   Both slain guards worked for Armored Transport of California
Inc., which has been struck seven times.
   Stewart Cruz Tecson, 27, was killed during a stop at a bank in
the San Fernando Valley on Oct. 14. Patrick Rooney, 35, was killed
at midmorning as he picked up cash at a supermarket in suburban
Bellflower on Dec. 15.
   ``All I can say is it was a cold and ruthless, execution-type
killing,'' Roberge said. ``It was uncalled for.''
   Joel Curnutt, director of operations for Armored Transport of
California, said the company had no comment while the robberies were
under investigation.
   Scarpelli said he quit two days after Tecson was slain, and he
said about 20 other guards have also either quit or given notice.
   ``My family couldn't take it anymore,'' said Scarpelli. He said
each armored car should have a crew of three so that the one
carrying money bags can be covered by an unencumbered guard, leaving
a third man to stay in the truck.

<HEAD>Loss Of Storage Tanker Could Cut Oil Production for Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Temporary loss of a huge oil-storage
vessel damaged in a North Sea storm could halt production for months
at three oilfields in the region, a Shell UK official said Sunday.
   At current prices of $15 per 42-gallon barrel, the estimated
combined daily output of 210,000 barrels is worth $3.15 million. It
represents 10 percent to 12 percent of Britain's North Sea
production.
   The modified tanker contained 100,000 tons of oil when it broke
free in high seas and 60 mph winds Saturday and drifted for five
hours, carrying its 34 crewmembers 13 miles and threatening
neighboring platforms. Two tugboats brought the floating storage
tank under control after five hours.
   The vessel, nearly a quarter-mile long, provided storage for
200,000 tons of crude. It acted as a central loading point for the
output of the Fulmar and Auk fields, operated by Shell, and the
Clyde field, operated by Britoil, now part of British Petroleum Co.
Ltd.
   A Shell spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
remote-controlled video-equipped submarine inspected the vessel's
damaged loading system Sunday. He said production will be halted for
``weeks, possibly months.''
   The rigs must stop pumping because they have no place to store
their oil.
   North Sea oil production was already running 10 percent below
potential because of the loss caused by the Piper Alpha disaster.
   That oil rig, owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp., caught fire
and exploded July 6, killing 167 men. The rig was destroyed and the
wells plugged with cement.
   Shell said Saturday's shutdown will have an impact on the company
but gave no details.

   For the first time in 20 years, the United
States has chosen a career diplomat as U.N. ambassador rather than a
high-profile political appointee.
   As president-elect, George Bush has moved away from the kind of
appointments that gave the U.N. post to Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
Andrew Young, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Bush himself _ all members of
the president's Cabinet.
   On Dec. 7, Bush named Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to
Israel, to replace Vernon A. Walters, a former deputy director of
the CIA.
   Some former ambassadors made it clear they reported to the
president himself, not the State Department. But Pickering, unlike
his predecessors, will not be in the Cabinet and will report to the
assistant secretary of state for international organizations.
   Bush's said his choice ``symbolizes the importance I place on the
United Nations, as well as the Foreign Service.''
   Pickering is the first career diplomat to get the posting since
Charles Yost was appointed in 1969. They are the only two career
officers to hold the position since it was established 43 years ago.
   Ambassadors have included Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson,
Arthur Goldberg, George Ball, John Scali and William Scranton.
   Although U.S.-U.N. relations have been strained during the
eight-year Reagan administration, Bush has said the global situation
``makes the U.N. a more positive arena for constructive U.S. action
than it has been in recent years, offering greater opportunity for
vigorous U.S. leadership in dealing with critical global problems.''
   The choice of Pickering reflects the new importance the United
States accords the 159-member organization, which this year scored
successes from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf to southern Africa.
   U.S. relations with the United Nations evolved from a love affair
to estrangement in the 1960s and 70s when the Soviet Bloc and
developing nations united to denounce the ``imperialist West.''
   Today, however, is an era of good feelings, respect for the world
body and no more name-calling. Improved U.S.-Soviet ties make the
United Nations an increasingly effective vehicle for tackling
international problems.
   Pickering, 57, has served as ambassador in Jordan and his
experience gives him extra credibility on the Middle East issue,
which figures prominently on the U.N. agenda.
   The Cabinet status for U.N. ambassador originated with Lodge, a
former presidential candidate who served from 1953 to 1960. Since
then no U.N. envoy, except Yost, settled for less in prestige,
salary and access to the president.
   But few observers see Pickering's posting as a downgrading of the
position.
   Ed Luck, president of the U.N. Association of the United States,
a pro-U.N. group, said it signifies ``a return to normalcy'' and a
commitment to use the United Nations to carry out foreign policy
objectives.
   ``He won't just give speeches defending our honor and
principles,'' he told The Associated Press.
   In the past, he said, ``there frequently has been some tension''
between the U.N. envoy and the administration, State Department or
Congress.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick was known for her combative speeches which
frequently pointed out the hypocrisy of some totalitarian regimes
criticizing the United States.
   Mark Franz, policy analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, which frequently criticizes the world body, said
Pickering's appointment shows ``that Mr. Bush will be in charge.
U.N. policy will not be made by an individual, charismatic person ...

<HEAD>Volcano Eruption Forces Chilean Town to Evacuate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A volcano in southern Chile erupted for
the first time in a century Sunday, prompting authorities to
evacuate about 2,000 people.
   Flor Verdugo, a school teacher in Malalcahuello who owns the only
telephone in the town, said the Lonquimay volcano began to erupt
about 4:15 p.m. (2:15 p.m. EST) after the area was rocked by three
strong earthquakes, according to state television in Santiago.
   There were no reports of injuries from the eruption or the
quakes. Temblors can often precede volcanic activity.
   The government's National Emergency Office said the evacuation of
virtually the entire population of Malalcahuello was only a
precaution and that the town, about 415 miles south of Santiago, was
not considered in danger.
   The government said three craters opened on the 8,400-foot
volcano, two of them emitting only heavy smoke. However, the largest
crater, with a radius of about 100 feet, spewed a thick carpet of
lava.
   Ms. Verdugo said a number of quakes have been felt in the area
for several days. The seismic activity, which has affected an area
of about 30 square miles, became more intense Sunday morning, she
said. There were no immediate Richter scale readings.
   Pedro Riffo, a specialist of La Frontera University in Temuco,
the largest city in the area, told local reporters the eruption did
not threaten any populated area. He said Malalcahuello, the closest
town, is surrounded by a chain of mountains that would serve as a
natural defense.
   Riffo said three other volcanoes exist in the area, but only one
of them, the Llaima, has shown some activity in recent years.
   The last registered eruption of the Lonquimay volcano occurred in
1889, Riffo said.

   A roadside inspection the day before a
propane tanker truck exploded on an interstate, killing nine people,
found the truck was free of defects, a federal investigator said.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators Saturday
released their initial findings of their probe into Friday's crash
of the truck on Interstate 240 in Memphis.
   The truck, carrying 9,500 gallons of the highly flammable
propane, skidded on a 25 mph exit ramp Friday, struck a retaining
wall and exploded.
   The dead included the driver of the truck, three occupants of
nearby houses that were set afire, and four people in other
vehicles. The ninth victim was another truck driver who died in a
crash that stemmed from the traffic jam that followed the first
crash.
   The propane truck had cleared an inspection Thursday by the
Arkansas Department of Transportation, James E. Burnett, head of the
NTSB investigation, said late Saturday.
   The driver, Randall Benson, 29, of West Memphis, Ark., was killed
in the crash. Burnett said Benson was thoroughly familiar with the
route along the accident site, was certified as medically fit to
drive hazardous materials, and had a good driving record with only
two minor accidents and no moving violations.
   ``Obviously, something happened,'' Burnett said. ``We're not
ready to say the driver lost control. It could have been something
else.''
   Burnett said the investigation is expected to take about nine
months. Gathering records regarding the investigation was hampered
because many offices were closed over the holiday weekend, he said.
   The interchange where the accident occurred has been criticized
as one of the most dangerous in the state. It is slated for a $100
million improvement.

<HEAD>Shamir Accepts Mubarak's Offer To Visit; Israel Prepares to Unveil
Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Sunday accepted
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's offer to visit Israel to discuss
the stalled peace process, and Shamir said he is preparing to unveil
a new peace plan.
   ``I would be very happy to receive him (Mubarak) in Israel,''
Shamir said in Hebrew on Israel television's Arabic language news
service. ``I can not say that there will be full agreement between
us but I assume that we can advance the peace process.''
   Mubarak said Saturday that he would visit Israel if the meeting
would help peace efforts.
   Shamir also said he will soon reveal a new peace initiative and
hinted it will be based on the 1979 Camp David peace accords signed
by Egypt and Israel. Palestinians have rejected the accords, which
call for negotiations between Israel, Egypt and Jordan, and limited
self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied territories.Egypt and
Jordan have said the accord is outdated.
   An Israeli official in the Foreign Ministry said Shamir and the
Foreign Ministry are preparing new peace plans as a result of the
United States' meeting with the Palestine Liberation Organization
last week.
   ``We are all feeling the pressure to change the momentum,'' said
the official who spoke on condition of anonimity.
   Shamir reiterated his position that the PLO is not a partner for
peace talks and called on the United States to end its dialogue with
the organization.
   ``We ask the United States to correct the mistake that they have
made,'' he said.
   Shamir said Israel will work toward an agreement with Egypt and
Jordan toward self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and
will permit free elections after an agreement is finalized.
   ``The first thing that will be done after signing the autonomy
agreement will be to have elections for an administrative council
that will administrate life in the area,'' Shamir said.
   ``This will become the legitimate representatives of the
Palestinan Arabs,'' he added.

   An official report said Monday that African
students forced their way into a university dance in Nanking and set
upon those inside with iron bars, bottles and rocks. Thirteen people
were reported injured.
   African students have been involved in several violent incidents
over the past several years. Chinese authorities deny charges by
Africans who say they suffer from racism both on campus and in
Chinese society.
   The latest clash began Saturday evening when the Africans forced
their way through a door into the dance, and it lasted into early
Sunday, said the official Xinhua News Agency.
   The report said 11 Chinese employees from Hehai University in the
eastern Chinese city were injured, one seriously. Two Africans
sustained slight injuries in the melee, it said.
   Xinhua said the problem started when two African students
escorting Chinese women to the dance refused a request by university
doorkeepers to register the women's names.
   After the clash, a group of Chinese students held a street march
Sunday to demand that the attackers be punished, the report said.
   In May 1986, about 18 Africans studying in the northeastern city
of Tianjin fled to Beijing because of reported threats from Chinese
after a bottle-throwing battle.
   In 1980, 19 Africans and Arabs and 24 Chinese were injured in a
fight in Shanghai that began over loud music from a foreigner's
radio.

   Five inmates arrested after a prison riot were
videotaped identifying themselves as prisoners later listed among 23
people killed in the uprising, raising the possibility they died in
custody.
   A Nayarit state judicial official reached by The Associated Press
on Sunday confirmed the men are now dead and said he did not know
how they could have died after being arrested.
   Officials at the prison at Tepic, the state capital about 500
miles northwest of Mexico City, said the death toll during the
two-day uprising was 23, with 19 of the deaths occurring Friday
night during two assaults by police.
   But a videotape shot by an NBC News camera crew and reviewed by
The Associated Press indicates there was only one assault and shows
at least 13 prisoners alive, flat on the ground, being questioned by
police.
   Five can be heard giving their names; those names are on a list
of dead given to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official
spokesman.
   A woman who had been held hostage told the AP in a telephone
interview Sunday that she was freed hours before what officials said
was the final guns-blazing assault.
   ``They (the prisoners) surrendered,'' said Brenda Margarita Rubio
Gonzalez, a prison records clerk.
   One witness told The AP that gunfire was heard inside the prison
after prisoners and then commandos went back inside the prison.
   ``I don't know what to say,'' said Ernesto Medina, assistant
director of criminal investigations, when asked about the videotape
on Sunday. ``I don't know anything about that.''
   Medina said he could not explain how the men could have died
after they were interrogated. He said that he had gone to the prison
at 11 p.m. Friday night and the prisoners were already dead when he
got there.
   Efforts to reach other state and federal officials by telephone
for comment were unsuccessful on Sunday, Christmas Day.
   The uprising began Thursday with a mutiny by prisoners angry that
they had been denied pardons. The prison warden was fatally wounded
at that time, officials said.
   The Venustiano Carranza prison was surrounded and two special
police teams, the Fox and Scorpion squads, were flown in from Mexico
City.
   According to the official version of events Friday night, the
commander of the Fox squad, Jorge Armando Duarte Badillo, was shot
to death by the mutinous prisoners while he was trying to talk them
into surrendering.
   Officials said the commando teams then launched an assault at
about 6 p.m. Friday that was repulsed, and finally launched another
attack at 11 p.m. Friday night that retook the prison administration
area and freed 19 hostages.
   However, NBC producer Oscar I. Delgado said a network camera crew
videotaped prisoners in custody at about 8:30 p.m. on Friday. The
prisoners had been brought into a park outside the prison, Delgado
said.
   Questioned on Sunday, Medina told The Associated Press that there
was only one assault, ``but it lasted a long time.''
   The death toll was initially given Friday night as six, but on
Saturday morning jumped to 22, then 24, with six listed as seriously
injured.
   The official death toll is now set at 23, Medina said Sunday,
including the warden, the police commander, and 21 prisoners.
   The videotape reviewed by the AP lasts a little over two minutes.
At least 13 prisoners can be seen lying on the ground surrounded by
police as officials move among them taking down their names.
   Although some of their clothing is ripped and at least two of the
prisoners appeared to have been wounded _ one had a bloody hand and
another a bloody face _ all were alive, lifting their heads to gaze
at the camera or answering questions from police.
   Sometimes a police officer can be heard kicking or poking a
prisoner, asking for a name or confirmation of a name as it is
written down. At one point a police official tries to halt the
taping, putting a hand over the camera.
   Five prisoners can be heard giving their names: Benjamin Gambero
Anzaldo, Jose Luis Parra Leyva, Arturo Torres Casillas, Ricardo
Hermosillo Guzman, and Enedino de la Cruz Simon.
   All five are on a list of dead provided Saturday to The
Associated Press by state spokesman Francisco Flores and confirmed
on Sunday by Medina.
   A witness to the events at the prison, who spoke on condition his
name not be used, said the prisoners were taken back into the
prison. This witness said that members of the Fox group re-entered
the prison at 10:00 p.m., and that shortly thereafter more than 30
shots were heard.
   Medina said Sunday that authorities were still questioning four
prisoners and three guards suspected of helping stage the riot. They
also were searching for two men who reportedly smuggled guns into
the prison by posing as lawyers.
   The prison's other 1,200 inmates remained under control
throughout the uprising.

<HEAD>Volunteers Spend Christmas Cleaning Birds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the third time in five years,
volunteers spent Christmas cleaning oil-soaked birds in western
Washington as the death toll of birds from a 70,000-gallon oil spill
continued to climb.
   Workers had recovered 570 live birds and more than 200 dead birds
by Sunday evening, said Pam Miller, a state biologist in charge of
the search and rescue effort. The live birds were kept in cardboard
boxes spread throughout a school's gymnasium, locker rooms and
hallways.
   The birds, mostly open-ocean birds such as murres, were tube-fed
twice a day with smelt and it could be days or weeks until they can
be returned to the wild, Ms. Miller said. Most were ``pretty well
coated with oil from head to toe'' when they arrived, she said.
   The birds were picked up by search crews covering a 30- to
40-mile section of the Washington coast following an oil spill that
occurred after a tugboat struck the fuel-oil barge it was towing to
Grays Harbor on Thursday.
   An emergency patch could not be placed on the barge until early
Saturday because of high seas. The barge was taken to Astoria, Ore.,
on Saturday, but not before spewing a 30-mile long oil slick. On
Sunday, it was moved to Portland, Ore., for further repairs.
   About 50 volunteers worked on the bird cleanup on Sunday at the
makeshift bird hospital, noisy with the sounds of squawking birds
tapping on their boxes. It took about an hour for each bird to be
cleaned by a pair of volunteers.
   Oil ruins the insulating effect of a bird's feathers, which can
cause it to die of cold, Ms. Miller said. The bird can also be
poisoned if it ingests oil while it cleans its feathers, she said.
   The search for birds will resume Monday, she said.
   A Department of Ecology spokesman said earlier that oil came
ashore along a three-mile stretch of beach from the entrance to
Grays Harbor, northward to Ocean Shores.
   There are two remaining strips of oil, between five and 15 miles
offshore, but officials expect the oil to break up or sink and not
come to shore, said Wildlife Department spokesman Doug Zimmer.
   The biggest known spill in Washington state waters was when
239,000 gallons of oil spewed from the tanker ARCO Anchorage in Port
Angeles harbor Dec. 21, 1985. Bird losses were conservatively put at
1,600 marine fowl and 475 ducks.
   There was also an oil spill in Puget Sound in 1984 that kept
volunteers cleaning birds over Christmas, said Ron Holcomb,
Department of Ecology spokesman.
   In the most recent spill, Sause Bros. Ocean Towing of Coos Bay,
Ore., the barge's owner, hired a company to begin cleanup operations
Saturday. Dick Lauer, manager of bulk products for Sause Bros., said
Sunday that he had no cleanup cost estimate and did not expect to
get one before late Monday.

   U.S. doctors who treated Armenian earthquake
victims learned how to ``make do and function in impossible
conditions'' but despaired after returing home that ``so much work
is left to be done,'' one of them said Sunday.
   An eight-with Armenian physicians and
hospitals in the Soviet republic, he said.
   ``So much work is left to be done. If we stop now, it will be a
sort of flash-in-the-pan type of effort,'' said Kvetan.
   ``Technologically, they are at least 20 years behind us,'' he
said. ``In terms of dedication, we cannot even come close to them.''
   During their stay, the team _ a technician, a pharmacist, a nurse
and five doctors _ treated hundreds of patients but found many
people ``chronically injured both physically and emotionally,''
Kvetan said.
   Ailments ranged from crush injuries such as kidney failure,
shock, respiratory failure and severe infections, he said.
   ``Some patients were trapped under rubble for up to 12 days lying
freezing on the ground, covered with cement and rock, not eating. We
had patients who had been dug up by their own family,'' he said.
   ``We learned you can stay up for 10 days with hardly any sleep if
you have to, that you can get things done even in the middle of
total chaos if you decide to do it,'' he said.
   ``We saw that medicine is an international science and physicians
are always able to work together. We saw we can improvise and make
do and function in impossible conditions.''
   Besides continuing to help Armenia, the doctors on the trip also
want to establish a ``flying critical care team'' to work with a
Seattle rescue and disaster unit they met in the Soviet Union, he
said.

   Americans celebrated Christmas by remembering the victims of the
Pan Am jet crash and the Armenian earthquake, while helping the
homeless and needy at home with gifts, food and prayers.
   Western states enjoyed a white Christmas, with San Francisco and
Las Vegas reporting rare snowfalls, while hundreds of Jewish
volunteers in Atlanta filled in at hospitals so that workers could
spend the holiday with their families. People left homeless by a
tornado in Tennessee that killed one and injured 15 on Christmas Eve
were given refuge at hotels.
   Church leaders urged their flocks to remember the estimated
55,000 people who died and 500,000 left homeless by the Dec. 7
earthquake in Armenia and the 258 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103
who were killed when the plane crashed Wednesday in Scotland.
   At St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, Cardinal John
O'Connor said the faith of the families of plane crash victims was
heartening. ``Thinking that I would console or encourage them,'' he
said, ``I found my own faith deepened instead, by their acceptance
of suffering, their willingness to let whatever happens in this
world happen, and to know that God still loves them very deeply.''
   In Ohio, worshipers gathered at the Hindu Community Temple near
Dayton to mourn the death of Om Dikshit, 54, a science professor
killed in the crash.
   In Boston, Catholics have collected $460,000 for Armenian
earthquake victims, with donations still coming in on Christmas,
Cardinal Bernard Law said.
   ``We are overwhelmed and thrilled and very grateful,'' said
Phyllis Martins, a member of the parish council of the Holy Trinity
Armenian Apostolic Church of Greater Boston. ``It's very
heartwarming to know that people of this country and people of the
world are so responsive.''
   President-elect George Bush and his wife, Barbara, also went to
church in Washington, joining a choir from the 19th Street Baptist
Church that sang the ``Hallelujah Chorus'' from Handel's ``Messiah.''
   Mrs. Bush told reporters her present from the president-elect
``was just what I asked for'' _ a computerized dictionary. She
didn't explain further, but it was believed she referred to a
hand-held, calculator-size electronic device. Asked what she gave
her husband, Mrs. Bush replied: ``A big, fat kiss.''
   At Grand Central Terminal in New York City, about 100 people
joined a candlelight ceremony for ``Mama,'' a homeless woman who
died there three years ago on Christmas Day. The homeless people
then marched to a hotel that prepared a Christmas dinner for about
1,300 needy people.
   For Tyrone Scott, 32, one of the marchers, it was his first
Christmas on the street. ``I think of my family all the time,'' he
said. ``I called them this morning and told them to forgive me for
not being there and told them I'd try to get there next year.''
   Twelve-year-old Celina Binkley moved into her new home on
Thanksgiving but remembered what it was like to be homeless. She was
among 25 people at a Christmas Eve vigil in Denver outside a vacant
house owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
``We're trying to support the homeless. It's like these people are
our family,'' she said.
   The spirit of good will prevailed in Los Angeles' 77th Street
police station where officers saved Christmas for a family that lost
its presents to a holiday burglar.
   Officers who took the report of the burglary were moved when a
father tried to explain to his 2-year-old daughter and 4-year-old
son why their presents were gone. The officers passed the hat at the
station house and bought the girl a doll and plastic dish set and
the boy a fire truck.
   Las Vegas reported its first Christmas Day snowfall in the 51
years that weather service records have been kept. Police officer
William Walklin said the snow, which began at late afternoon and
continued off and on during the evening, accumulated to about half
an inch in some areas but mostly melted when it hit the ground.
   In San Francisco, where snow fell briefly overnight on the city's
highest elevations, the first snowfall in years, needy people
bundled tight lined up outside churches and soup kitchens as early
as 7 a.m. At St. Anthony's Dining Room, volunteers served a turkey
dinner to 5,000 to 6,000 people.
   ``There must have been about 2,000 people out or more in severe
cold weather who sought shelter and had no place to go,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial Methodist Church in
the Tenderloin District. ``There was no room at the inn.''
   Snow also fell in Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, Montana and
Wyoming. Light snow fell in parts of New York and Michigan.
   In the Albany, N.Y., suburb of Clifton Park, worshipers met in
the office of the Rev. Bede Ferrara to pray for the 14 American
hostages held in Lebanon. ``Christmas time is good time to make
people more conscious of people who are ill-treated and held
hostage,'' said Ferrara, a Franciscan priest.
   In Atlanta, Jewish volunteers in a program by B'nai B'rith let
workers in several hospitals spend the holiday at home. ``Everybody
involved feels that it promotes brotherhood between Christians and
Jews,'' said Neil Freedland, who was working Sunday morning at
Northside Hospital. ``My wife and I were saying the other day that
when we take off on the High Holidays, there are always Christians
filling in for us. ... This is our chance to help.''
   The National Safety Council has estimated 350 to 450 were likely
to die on the nation's highways during the holiday weekend.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said holiday phone traffic
could reach a record 47 million long-distance calls by midnight on
Christmas, up about 3 million from last year.

   Palestinian youths threw
rocks at soldiers as hundreds of heavily guarded pilgrims toured the
biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ in a driving rain on Christmas
Day.
   Elsehwere in the Israeli-occupied territories, two Palestinians
died of gunshot wounds and eighteen others were injured in clashes
with soldiers, Arab reports said. Christmas celebrations in
Bethlehem were markedly subdued because of drenching rain that began
Saturday and the year-old Palestinian uprising. Sunday's fatalities
raised the number of Arabs killed in the revolt to 336. Fourteen
Israelis also have died.
   In Bethlehem's Manger Square, where the Bible says Jesus was
born, the Christmas tree was decorated with only a few colored
lights. Police and soldiers inspected cars for security.

   Soldiers and volunteers spent
Christmas scouring the countryside for clues and victims from Pan Am
Flight 103, taking a break from the grim search to join saddened
townspeople at somber church services.
   The Roman Catholic bishop of Galloway, the Rev. Maurice Taylor,
brought a message that Jesus Christ ``is alive today in this town
and in the hearts of the people.''
   Two pews were reserved at the Holy Trinity Roman Catholic church
for relatives of crash victims who had come from the United States.
At All Saints Church, a small Anglican parish, two relatives stood
silently while the congregation sang, ``O Come All Ye Faithful.''

   Pope John Paul II appealed for help for AIDS
sufferers in his annual holiday message Sunday, and said his
Christmas wish was that ``science and love'' will find the cure for
the deadly disease.
   The remarks were the pontiff's most extensive yet about acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   The white-robed pontiff, speaking from the balcony over the main
entrance to St. Peter's Basilica, also appealed for help for
survivors of the devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia.

   With tears in his eyes, President-elect
George Bush's son presented candy and gifts Sunday to brighten the
Christmas of children injured in Armenia's earthquake.
   John E. Bush, a Miami real estate developer, and his 12-year-old
son George flew into Yerevan aboard a DC-8 cargo plane carrying
relief supplies. They toured the disaster zone in a bus and stopped
in the village of Spitak, flattened by the Dec. 7 quake.
   The Bushes later returned to Yerevan and visited rooms on three
floors of Children's Hospital No. 3, where more than 600 youngsters
hurt in the quake have been treated. They handed out candy bars,
teddy bears, games of tick-tack-toe and other donated toys flown in
by the Americares charity.

   It has been a deadly year for Southern
California money messengers _ 13 armored car holdups, three bank
robberies, two slayings and the theft of hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   The fatal shooting of an armored car guard during a stop at a
supermarket Dec. 15 was the latest in the rash of heists that have
often occurred during busy daytime hours and frequently ended in
gunfire.
   ``The only time you feel safe is when you're in that truck and
it's for very few minutes until your next stop,'' said Nick
Scarpelli, a guard who quit after a friend at Armored Transport of
California was slain in October.
