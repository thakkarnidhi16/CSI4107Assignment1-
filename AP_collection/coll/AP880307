   National Assembly candidate
Luis Mejia Miranda on Monday ridiculed reports he was involved in
misusing U.S. aid money. ``Can you imagine that if I had ... ($2
million) I would still be in this country?,'' he asked.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's son denied he was trying to
protect Mejia, a fellow Christian Democrat who was reported under
investigation in the case.
   ``I deny any tie because I am not protecting him and because I
am against corruption,'' said Alejandro Duarte, candidate for mayor
of San Salvador in the March 20 elections.
   The New York Times said Sunday that Mejia is being investigated
for allegedly misusing up to $2 million of U.S. aid.
   It said the money was part of a $10 million program to assist
war-ravaged areas and help win the support of Salvadorans in the
war against leftist rebels.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified Salvadoran and U.S. officials
as saying it could be the largest case of theft of U.S. aid money
during the administration of President Duarte, elected in May 1984
for a five-year term.
   In an interview with local newspapers, Mejia said ``that news
(about alleged misuse of funds) surprises me because it is totally
false.''
   Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, Duarte's vice president and
secretary-general of the governing Christian Democratic Party, said
the article was ``full of vagueness and imprecisions with the
political intention of damaging the party.''
   He said it was written ``within a strategic conception of the
ultra-right of the country.''
   He also read a communique saying the party backed Alejandro
Duarte as ``an absolutely honorable, capable and honest man.''
   Referring to allegations against Mejia, the communique said ``we
abstain from making a value judgment because we do not know if
there is evidence.''
   Alejandro Duarte denied being an associate of Mejia and said he
had urged Mejia to cooperate with any investigation.
   ``It is vital that the truth be arrived at,'' he told reporters.
``If he (Mejia) is clean, he does not have to be afraid. If he
feels he is outside of the accusations, then he should submit
himself to any investigation.''
   ``All this is a dirty political game and I feel indignant for
having been involved,'' Alejandro Duarte said.
   Asked about his relationship with Mejia, he replied, ``I have no
personal friendship with him. I know him like the majority of the
members of the party.''
   The New York Times said Mejia resigned three months ago as
director of the National Commission for the Restoration of Areas,
but President Duarte agreed to allow him to become a party
candidate for the National Assembly on the recommendation of
Alejandro Duarte.
   A U.S. Embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``these allegations are being studied.''
   ``At this time the inspector general of AID (the U.S. Agency for
International Development) has made no determination of bad use of
funds in this program,'' the source said. ``However, other recent
studies have identified certain aspects of financial control and
management of CONARA (the restoration commission) and since January
of this year there have been some changes in the method of
management.''
   Castillo Claramount said the party asked for an investigation of
the alleged theft of funds. If there is evidence it occurred, the
party will ask the assembly to remove the immunity Merida enjoys as
a substitute deputy and will ask the electoral council to revoke
his candidacy, he said.

<HEAD>Paris' Ritz Opens Cooking School And Cordon Bleu Goes Hi-Tech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two French-cooking schools _ one the oldest, the
other the newest _ are giving the world's gastronomic capital yet
another culinary lift.
   Cordon Bleu, the oldest and most prestigious, has taken on a
high-tech image at a new location in a five-story building that
once was an infirmary.
   The luxurious Ritz Hotel, the newest, is opening its kitchens
April 5 to students of haute cuisine.
   The cachet of the elegant Right Bank hotel is maintained in the
decor of its new basement cooking school, where gleaming
white-tiled spaces and hand-painted murals set the tone.
   The Cordon Bleu, long situated in cramped quarters in the classy
Champ de Mars district under the Eiffel Tower, moved in January to
the building on an anonymous corner of the 15th arrondissement in
southern Paris.
   The school where servants from affluent families long ago
watched cooking demonstrations in an amphitheater now offers every
high-tech amenity, including video screens.
   Both schools offer all levels of instruction up to professional.
   Despite the new home, tradition at the venerable Cordon Bleu
remains intact. The top diploma at the Cordon Bleu is awarded to
students who pass a nine-month session. The Ritz school's top
diploma follows a 12-week course.
   Hardly a newcomer to fine food, the Ritz has been known for its
cuisine since Auguste Escoffier attracted international gastronomes
early in the century. It decided to spread its know-how as part of
an overall renovation plan started by Mohammed Al-Fayed, the
Egyptian entrepreneur who bought the hotel nine years ago.
   ``We feel we're offering unique and superior instruction for a
private cooking school,'' said Gregory Usher, an American who left
the Cordon Bleu to take over the Ritz school's administration.
``Our chefs are tops.''
   The courses are to be supervised by three of the Ritz's own
chefs, all winners of the top professional award, Meilleur Ouvrier
de France. Most daily courses will be handled by two chefs with
credentials from prestigious French restaurants. One, Andre
Guillut, perfected his English while working at restaurants like
l'Orangerie and Ma Cuisine in Los Angeles.
   The up-to-date equipment includes permanently cooled pastry
marbles, the latest in ovens, freezers and mixers. The hotel's meat
smoker will be used for ``charcuterie'' courses, and video outlets
are available for taping recipes.
   Pupils can browse in a reference library, taste wine with the
Ritz's sommelier, and the change and shower after the course in a
special area.
   Across the Seine at Cordon Bleu, in the business since 1896,
it's a whole new world.
   Spanking clean in light greys and blues, today's big-scale
school includes two demonstration rooms, four huge cooking and
pastry rooms, and a beautiful winter garden.
   Equipment includes convection ovens, pastry-rising ovens and
huge dough-kneaders, plus special machines for a new course on
vacuum-packing and cooking _ to be taught by Patrick Martin, the
1987 winner of the French National Cuisine and Pastry trophy.
   ``We're still emphasizing traditional French cuisine,'' said
Robin Cahill, a Cordon Bleu graduate and its spokeswoman. ``But in
our expanded facilities just about everything is new.''
   ``The basics are still the main point,'' said Chef Martin, one
of seven chefs. ``The students will still learn how to chop, knead,
whip and do everything else by hand as well.''
   The overwhelming majority of Cordon Bleu students are from
abroad _ about 30 percent American and 20 percent Japanese, said
Ms. Cahill.
   While the Ritz plans English translations in all courses, the
Cordon Bleu still teaches its advanced courses in French.
   Financing for the modernization comes from the Pages group,
headed by Andre Cointreau, which bought the school in 1981.
   Intermediate students at the Ritz may choose a one-to-six week
course of practical sessions and demonstrations at cost in French
francs of about $800 a week. The Ritz's highest-level Auguste
Escoffier course, a 12-week session, costs about $10,000.
   Cordon Bleu's main three 12-week courses comprise a cycle of
``basic'' through ``superior'' at a cost of about $4,200 each.
   To get the coveted Cordon Bleu Grand Diplome, pupils now spend
nine months, reduced from 12, in intensive cooking and pastry
courses preparing for the big exam, at a cost of $19,000.
   ``We're also offering new intensive four-day practical and
demonstration sessions,'' ranging from charcuterie to regional
cuisine and costing about $500, said Ms. Cahill.
   Both schools conduct wine tasting courses.
   A visitor to Paris who wants to compare the big-school ambience
of the Cordon Bleu with the tonier Ritz can attend demonstrations
at either one for less than $35 each.

   Rockwell International Corp. and two former
managers pleaded innocent Monday to charges that they overbilled
the Air Force by $450,000 on a sophisticated satellite navigational
system.
   In a brief hearing, U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall
ordered the company and its former managers to file pretrial
motions by April 4 and set a May 3 trial date, Rockwell spokesman
Jeff Charney said.
   He indicated the company plans to make pretrial motions but
declined to elaborate.
   The company and the former managers _ Donald Carter, materials
division director at the its Seal Beach plant, and Robert
Zavodnick, manager of major subcontracts within the division _ were
named in a 25-count federal indictment in January.
   The indictment alleged that the company and two men
double-billed the government for work on the NAVSTAR global
navigational system that uses radio signals from satellites to
pinpoint locations on earth.
   As a result, the indictment claimed, Rockwell received $450,000
in unlawful profits.
   The company has denied the allegations.

   Militant monks in Tibet and restive Armenians in
the Soviet Union are among the minority nationalities in those
countries now testing, sometimes with violence, the limits of their
governments' professed policies of openness.
   Moscow calls them ``hooligans.'' To Beijing they are
``splittists.'' But to both countries they represent a threat to
the reputation and unity of the state.
   Thirty-one people died last week in rioting in the Soviet city
of Sumgait in Azerbaijan, where Christian Armenians are unhappy
about being part of mostly Moslem Azerbaijan. In Tibet, up to 23
have died in clashes between Chinese police and Tibetans in October
and over the weekend.
   In both countries, the Communist governments in the past have
suppressed their minorities to unite vast tracts of land under the
ruling ethnic group, the Hans in China and the Russians in the
Soviet Union.
   Josef V. Stalin purged the Ukraine in the 1930s, and Mao
Tse-tung swiftly cracked down on unrest in Tibet and Moslem west
China in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Both countries, with China in the lead, have now declared
greater tolerance for different views, exposing both to flashpoints
of nationalist sentiment.
   China blames outside forces for its troubles, saying
pro-independence supporters of Tibet's exiled religious leader, the
Dalai Lama, were responsible for the first outbreak of violence in
the Tibetan capital of Lhasa last October.
   Moscow is faced with a wider problem of ethnic disputes in
Armenia, religious identity in Kazakhstan and political activism in
the Baltic republics of Estonia and Lithuania.
   Foreign journalists in China have had slightly better access to
the troubled areas than their Moscow-based counterparts. China
expelled 14 foreign journalists from Lhasa last October, and has
since given permission for only a few to return.
   But Lhasa authorities, hungry for tourist spending to help
China's poorest province, have not stopped group tours, and some
reporters have joined excursion groups to Tibet.
   The Soviet Union let a few correspondents go to Vilnius,
Lithuania, on a Foreign Ministry-sponsored trip for a planned
demonstration to mark the Feb. 16 declaration of independence.
   But reporters there were followed constantly.
   No foreign journalist has been allowed lately into Armenia or
Azerbaijan. Telephone calls to Yerevan sometimes went through, but
Nagorno-Karabakh, the center of the Armenian-Azeri dispute, cannot
be reached at all and Sumgait only rarely.
   Reflecting Moscow's ``glasnost'' and Beijing's similar policy of
``kaifang,'' the official media in both countries have carried
limited reports of the disturbances.
   China's press has stressed that only a small number of Tibetans
have joined the disturbances, and has sent out a barrage of stories
about Tibetans criticizing the separatists and saying how much
better life is under socialism.
   The government has stressed that it will continue to respect the
local customs and help alleviate poverty in the regions where the
nation's 67 million non-Han minorities live.
   Moscow, too, has linked the rioting to a small number of
``hooligans.'' Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, however, in a Feb.
18 speech stressed the importance of working out a new policy on
nationalities and said the Cental Committee would hold a special
plenary session to discuss the matter.

   An Army private who flew his small airplane
into prohibited airspace over President Reagan's Santa Barbara
County ranch must spend 30 weekends in jail.
   Ralph William Myers, 33, of Fort Lewis, Wash., convicted of
lying to authorities about the reason he strayed into prohibited
airspace on Aug. 13, was sentenced Monday by U.S. District Judge
Manuel L. Real.
   Despite a Probation Department recommendation of probation, Real
sentenced Myers to three years in jail for each of two counts of
making false statements and then suspended all but 60 days of the
incarceration. The judge also ordered Myers to donate 1,000 hours
to charitable service.
   Myers' jail time will begin April 9 and is not to interfere with
his military service. Myers could have been sentenced to 10 years'
imprisonment and a $500,000 fine.
   Outside court, Myers said he was made a scapegoat by the federal
government because reports that there had been a near-miss caused
``hysteria.''
   Myers maintains his plane was no closer than 800 feet from the
president's helicopter, Marine One. Reagan's Marine pilot, Lt. Col.
Michael Glynn, says Myers' plane passed about 200 feet in front of
his helicopter and 150 feet below it.
   Myers' attorney, Manuel Araujo, said they will appeal the
sentence.
   Myers, who has been stripped of his pilot's license, originally
told federal agents he strayed into the prohibited airspace while
looking for a lost contact lens in the cabin. He later said he had
lied about the lens because, ``I was trying to stay out of more
trouble.''
   Myers was demoted from private first class to private for being
absent without leave. He still has 18 months left in the Army.

<TEXT>
   A group of men backing Panama's new government
seized control of the country's disputed consulate in London Monday
night by smashing through the glass door with a Land Rover, police
reported.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the seizure took place
because the consul in London, Eduardo Arango, refused to give up
his post despite being fired by the new government.
   Control of Panama's Embassy in Washington is also in dispute
following the ouster on Feb. 26 of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
He was removed from office after he tried to dismiss Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the military leader and de facto ruler.
   The London consulate is about a mile east of the embassy. The
BBC said Arango was not in the consulate when the raid occurred.
   Police said in a statement that six men _ two representatives of
Panamanian Ambassador Guillermo Vega and four members of a British
security firm _ smashed their way into the consulate.
   ``Shortly after this, several people left the building,
including three women believed to be secretaries, and a number of
security staff. One glass-paneled front door was damaged and no one
was injured as a result of the incident,'' the statement added.
   One of the staff members forced out of the consulate, Tourism
Commissioner Rolando Domingo, 24, said: ``We were just working in
there and then suddenly we heard a crash.''
   He said the Land Rover broke through the glass doors and then a
group of men burst into the building carrying large hammers. ``They
threatened us with hammers and one tried to hit my face. They took
my passport and documents. Then they pushed me down the stairs and
out of the building,'' Domingo said.
   London police sealed off the area around the consulate in Tudor
Street in the City, London's financial district.
   The United States and many other countries still consider
Delvalle the president of Panama. He was removed from office by the
National Assembly, which is dominated by Noriega supporters.
   The Reagan administration has called for Noriega's ouster since
he was indicted in Florida last month on drug trafficking charges.
   The BBC reported that Arango was in Panama at the time of
Delvalle's ouster and has said he helped smuggle Delvalle from his
residence to a hiding place in the Central American country.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said Arango
received a phone call at home from the consulate staff about the
Monday night raid.
   The agency quoted Arango as saying he was prevented from
entering the consulate after the attack and that one of the men
occupying it had told him they were working for Vega and carrying
out orders from Panama.
   British government officials said they were told last Friday
that Arango was being fired as consul.
   Arango said he had received letters from Panama saying he was
dismissed but had ignored them, Press Association said.
   As workmen repaired the doors, one of the British security
guards who took part in the raid said:
   ``It is an exaggeration to say we smashed in. We nudged the
doors with the Land Rover. The police say they may prosecute us for
mounting the pavement (sidewalk) but I don't think they can do
anything else. We were authorized to enter the building but I
cannot divulge any more.''
   The four guards involved work for GB Security, a private
security company based in south London. They said they would be
guarding the building overnight.
   A spokesman at the British Foreign Office, who in accordance
with British practice declined to be named, said it was too early
to say what action, if any, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
might take over the incident.

<TEXT>
   David R. Bradley Sr., chairman and chief
executive officer of the St. Joseph News-Press & Gazette Co., has
died at age 70.
   Bradley, who died Sunday at a Kansas City hospital, was the
second generation of a communications family that has published The
News-Press and Gazette for nearly 50 years.
   He was publisher of the St. Joseph newspapers from 1956 to 1981,
succeeding his father, Henry D. Bradley, as president of the
company in 1972. The elder Bradley died in 1973.
   Bradley was known for keeping the newspapers on the leading edge
of technology, switching to all-electronic production more than a
decade ago. He also led the company into the TV market.
   The company's holdings include stations in Savannah, Ga.;
Jackson, Miss.; Hattiesburg, Miss.; Sioux Falls, S.D., and
Wilmington, N.C., and cable TV systems in St. Joseph, Savannah and
Macon, Mo.
   He was active in The Associated Press and served as a director
of the news cooperative from 1970 to 1979. He also was first vice
chairman of the AP, serving in that position from 1977-79.
   ``Dave had a unique combination of common sense, a sharp
business mind and a zest for life,'' said Louis D. Boccardi,
president and general manager of the AP. ``You could count on him
to help you get to the heart of any problem, but also to remind you
that your problem was probably a little less earth-shaking than you
thought it was. He was a treasured friend and a wise counsel.''
   Bradley was born in Toledo, Ohio, and graduated from the
University of Wisconsin in 1939.
   Survivors include his wife, Shirley Wyeth Bradley; two
daughters; two sons and 11 grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Wind, cold and snow moved thorugh the central Rockies today,
producing brisk wind gusts, thunderstorms, hail and snow squalls.
   The cold front moved into Idaho and parts of Utah and Wyoming on
Sunday evening. At Pocatello, Idaho, wind gusted to 41 mph as
visibility dropped to a quarter mile in snow squalls.
   Thunderstorms broke out when the cold front passed through
northern Utah, producing small hail, frequent lightning and
scattered power outages. Wind gusted to 45 mph in the Trenton and
Logan areas. The storm dumped up to a foot of snow in Utah's
mountains, and lesser amounts elsewhere in the state.
   Snow and blowing snow was reported late Sunday across central
and southern Wyoming. Wind gusted to near 40 mph at Rock Springs
and visibility at Laramie dropped to a half mile. Up to a foot of
snow was expected in the southwest mountains of Wyoming.
   Eight to 16 inches of snow was expected in the mountains of
Colorado. High winds should cause blowing and drifting snow and
poor visibility in the state's mountain passes.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms moved through parts of southeast
Virginia and eastern North Carolina on Sunday evening. Nickel-size
hail was reported at Gatesville, N.C., near the Virginia-North
Carolina line.
   Santa Ana winds were expected to develop across Southern
California today. A wind advisory was in effect for the northern
mountains of Southern California. By tonight, winds may gust faster
than 50 mph in some canyon areas of the San Bernardino Valley.
   Clear skies covered most of the nation this morning, but dense
fog advisories were posted for parts of northern and central
Florida and southwest Louisiana.
   Temperatures ahead of the cold front were mild Sunday, with a
72-degree reading at St. George, Utah. The high for the nation
Sunday was 88 at Yuma, Ariz.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 14 at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 71 at Homestead Air Force Base, Fla.
   For today, rain or snow showers were forecast from northern
Arizona and the central Rockies across the northern Plains; and
scattered rainshowers from northwest Kansas to the upper
Mississippi Valley. Skies should be mostly sunny over the eastern
third of the nation, except for a few snowshowers over northern New
England.
   Much of the nation should have highs in the 50s or 60s. Highs
should be in the 30s and 40s from the northern and central Rockies
across the northern half of the Plains and the Great Lakes region
into New England. Temperatures should reach the 70s and low 80s
from Southern California across the desert Southwest, and from the
southern Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast.

   At least one policeman was killed and 28 injured
in Tibet over the weekend in clashes between police and protesters
demanding Tibet's independence from China, the People's Daily
reported today.
   The newspaper, the voice of the Communist Party, quoted Tibet's
top police official in its report on rioting Saturday in the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   The newspaper did not say how many Tibetans were injured.
Unconfirmed reports from Western sources in Lhasa said three to
nine people were killed, including one Buddhist monk and two
Chinese police officers.
   Western sources contacted in Lhasa said the city was quiet today
and Sunday but that the Jokhang Temple, around which Tibetans
battled police, was closed. The sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said stores were open and marketplace stalls were doing
business today.
   In India, meanwhile, 500 Tibetan refugees, chanting ``We shall
overcome,'' demonstrated in New Delhi today against the Chinese
crackdown in Lhasa.
   Police prevented the demonstrators from going to the Chinese
Embassy. No injuries were reported in sporadic clashes between
protesters and police.
   The demonstration was organized by Tibetan Freedom Movement, an
organization of self-exiled Tibetans, and the Tibetan Youth
Congress.
   India has allowed 120,000 Tibetans and their temporal leader,
the Dalai Lama, to stay in India. The Dalai Lama fled to India in
1959 after an abortive Tibetan uprising against the Chinese.
   The People's Daily today quoted the Tibetan police official,
Public Security Bureau Chief Lang Jie, as saying on Tibetan
television Sunday that the disturbances in Lhasa began when
``separatists'' infiltrated a crowd on the final day of a 10-day
prayer festival. He said they started shouting ``independence for
Tibet'' and other ``counter-revolutionary'' slogans.
   Lang said 20 to 30 Buddhist monks circled the Jokhang Temple,
shouting slogans and throwing stones and damaging Chinese
television vans. The official China News Service earlier gave the
number as 60.
   They also attacked the Tibetan branch of the Buddhist
Association and set fire to a car belonging to the group,
controlled by the Chinese government.
   ``Their purpose was to destroy the peace and unity of our
country and our region and the peaceful and prosperous life of all
nationalities (in Tibet),'' he was quoted as saying. The report did
not say how many Tibetans took part in the riots or if there were
any arrests.
   Saturday was the first outbreak of violence since last Oct. 1,
when 2,000 Tibetans, led by Buddhist monks, set fire to a police
station facing the Jokhang Temple. Police opened fire, and at least
14 people were killed.
   China, which claims Tibet has been an integral part of the
nation for centuries, moved troops into the remote mountain region
in 1950.
   Many Tibetans deeply resent the Beijing government because of
oppression of Tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of
temples during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.
   Although China has tried to redress past wrongs, friction
remains between the Tibetans and the Hans, China's ethnic majority,
which continues to hold many senior posts in Lhasa.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said today that rioters
``stormed, looted and set fire to shops and restaurants and beat up
policemen sent to maintain order.''
   It said rioters with steel bars and wooden sticks knocked down
policemen Yuan Shisheng and Yang Yuchen, stabbed them and threw
them from a second-floor window. Yuan, a 22-year-old Tibetan, died
later in a hospital and Yang was reported in serious condition.
   The Western sources said Tibetans set fire to vehicles and lit
bonfires over a 12-hour period, and that police fired tear gas
during the day to control the violence. Gunshots were heard after
dark, they said.
   The Lhasa government has turned down almost all requests by
foreign journalists to visit Lhasa and has restricted tourism to
the area since the disturbances last October.

   The dollar was lower in thin early European
trading today and foreign currency dealers said they don't expect
it to break out of a narrow trading range before new American trade
figures are released next week.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The January trade report is due to be released March 17 and one
dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt, West Germany, said the market
will be paralyzed until then.
   ``We just move along from trade figure to trade figure,'' he
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.35 yen to a closing 128.87. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 128.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.6865 West German marks, down from 1.6940
   _1.3960 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030
   _5.7090 French francs, down from 5.7300
   _1.8952 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010
   _1,243.75 Italian lire, down from 1,248.00
   _1.2535 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2547
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7972, more expensive than
late Friday's $1.7740.
   Traders said the pound was strong throughout Europe because of
relatively high British interest rates.
   Gold prices were lower in London and higher in Zurich.
   The metal opened in London at a bid price of $437 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $437.50. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $436.
   One bullion dealer said market participants in London were
taking profits following Friday's technical rally in New York.
   ``It is going to keep falling,'' he said. ``There is a lot of
selling around.''
   In Zurich, the bid price was $434.25, up from $432 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents to close at a bid
$438.75.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.38 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.41.

   Prince Charles thrilled spectators
by shaking hands on both sidelines after beating an American polo
squad assembled for the royal occasion.
   ``I can't believe it. I was so shocked,'' said Anabelle Mariaca,
who shook hands with the Prince of Wales after the 90-minute match
Sunday at the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club. ``I told him I was
from Bolivia, and he said, `I bet the weather is better there than
here.' ''
   The prince's Windsor Park team beat Palm Beach 6-4 on a soggy
field doused by occasional rain. The prince, scheduled to fly home
today via New York, scored a goal on a penalty shot, and teammate
Peter Brant said Charles saved five or six goals on defense.
   ``He played very well,'' Brant said. ``He hadn't played in
competition since the end of August, but he made some beautiful
back shots.''
   Spectators included King Constantine of Greece and Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, father-in-law of Prince Andrew, Charles' younger brother.
   Charles' wife, Princess Diana, had other commitments, a
Buckingham Palace spokesman said. Andrew and his wife, Sarah,
finished a 10-day tour of Southern California Sunday and headed
back to London.
   Officials said the prince's visit with spectators afterward was
unplanned but not unusual. To the fans, however, it was clearly a
surprise.
   Chris Zeiser of West Palm Beach, who shook hands with Charles,
apologized to him for the weather.
   ``Well, I'll have to come back again,'' replied the prince, who
has visited the club twice before.
   About 8,500 people attended the match at the 6,200-seat stadium.
Both the sporting event and a luncheon for about 500 people
beforehand benefitted Friends of the Masai Mara, a conservation
group for a wildlife habitat in Kenya.
   The founders of the organization, Geoffrey and Jorie Kent, were
the prince's hosts and the first to greet the prince and king when
they flew in Saturday from Pittsburgh, where they had attended a
fund-raising dinner Friday.
   Charles, who has been outspoken recently about architecture,
went from the airport to visit developer Donald Trump's 118-room
mansion Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. Charles spent two nights at the
Kents' ranch west of Lake Worth.
   Charles was the honored guest at a wildlife demonstration
conducted on the polo field by Jim Fowler of TV's ``Wild Kingdom,''
who presented a lion cub, aardvark, several birds and a 7-year-old
cheetah.
   When Fowler coaxed an eagle to fly to him by holding up scraps
of food, the prince asked, ``Is that off the luncheon menu?''
   The eagle landed on the back of Fowler's hand with a message in
its claw. Charles, who read it to the audience, said, ``All
wildlife thanks those gathered here for your interest in wildlife.''
   The prince joked, ``I didn't know this eagle could write, though
clearly it does.''
   Cheetah handler Cathryn Hilker took Charles' right hand, and
together they petted the cat's face. The prince seemed reluctant,
but the animal licked his hand.
   ``She loves men's hands because they have hair on them,'' Ms.
Hilker explained.

<HEAD>Demands For Religious Freedom After Packed Mass</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Roman Catholics
chanted ``We want religious freedom!'' after thousands crowded into
a cathedral for a Mass honoring a 13th-century Czech princess who
renounced royal wealth to serve God.
   The Mass on Sunday at St. Vitus Cathedral, in the Castle complex
where Communist President Gustav Husak lives, drew about 8,000
people.
   It was one of the biggest religious services in the capital
since the Communist takeover in 1948 and an indication of the
reviving strength of the nation's Roman Catholic church.
   Dozens of plainclothes security officers were seen inside and
outside the cathedral while Mass was held to honor the princess who
is to be canonized by the Vatican later this year.
   Police arrested 16 dissidents and religious activists under
48-hour detention orders on Friday and Saturday, apparently to
prevent them from attending the Mass. A dissident source said five
people remained in detention Sunday night, but four of them were
expected to be freed today.
   Augustin Navratil, a Roman Catholic activist from Moravia, was
detained Friday morning but there was no word he was free late
Sunday, the source said.
   Navratil was the author of a 31-point church petition for more
religious freedom that has gained more than 300,000 signatures,
making it the largest such action in the Soviet bloc since 1945.
   Five other dissidents were briefly detained when they tried to
visit a British diplomat Friday, and two others also were briefly
held that night.
   After the Mass, about 1,000 people went from the cathedral to
the nearby residence of Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek. A few hundred
chanted ``We want bishops,'' ``We want religious freedom'' and ``We
want the Pope.''
   The chanting crowd appeared to reflect growing discontent among
Catholics at the lack of bishops in 10 of the country's 13 sees.
   The Vatican has refused to accept government proposals to
appoint as bishops members of the state-sponsored Pacem in Terris
organization, a group of priests not recognized by the Holy See.
   ``Long live the Holy Father'' was another chant from the crowd
outside Tomasek's residence, which adjoins the castle where Husak
lives. The presidential flag was flying, indicating the 75-year-old
president was home during the unusual demonstration.
   There is no official estimate of the number of believers in
Czechoslovakia, but Vatican officials estimate about 60 percent of
the 15.5 million citizens are Catholic.

<HEAD>University's Pre-Payment Plan Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falling bond interest rates and unexpectedly
high tuition increases have forced Duquesne University to suspend a
trendsetting tuition prepayment plan, according to school officials.
   The small Roman Catholic university announced three years ago
that alumni could enroll their newborn children for $4,450 as full
tuition payment for four years of education. The plan was expanded
in 1986 to include non-alumni.
   The college takes the money and invests it, with the proceeds
covering tuition for four years of college when the child is grown.
   The plan prompted about a dozen other private colleges to follow
suit. Six states also adopted plans that would enable parents to
prepay a fixed amount of the child's college tuition, starting at
birth.
   Duquesne spokeswoman Ann Rago confirmed Sunday that the
university's board of trustees had voted Wednesday to suspend the
plan.
   ``When we began the program, it was a much different economic
climate, but things have changed so we decided to suspend it,'' she
said.
   The college will keep its commitment to 622 families already
enrolled in the program, Ms. Rago said.
   When the plan was created, according to Ms. Rago, the
university's rate of return on the bonds was 10.8 percent. It has
since dropped to 8.52 percent, she said.
   Tuition for 1988-89 recently was raised 8 percent, rather than
the originally projected 6 percent.
   The university found it would be necessary to raise the 1987
tuition prepayment for a newborn to $8,630. That was calculated to
cover tuition costs of $102,604 over four years, ending in the year
2005.
   For a 15-year-old, the one-time investment rose from $12,864 to
$24,310.
   ``At this time, those numbers don't make the plan feasible,''
Ms. Rago said. ``The administration will re-examine it if the
economic conditions change.''

   Hungarian intellectuals and a member of
Parliament have called on Hungary to allow more ethnic Hungarian
refugees to emigrate from Romania and appealed for international
support in monitoring their rights.
   About 20 people spoke at the all-day forum Sunday in a theater
in Budapest. More than 700 people attended the meeting,
participants informed The Associated Press by telephone from the
Hungarian capital.
   The meeting Sunday was the second one of the ``Democratic
Forum'' since the group was formed on Sept. 27 in southern Hungary.
The document issued at the September meeting called for ``genuinely
effective reform'' to resolve Hungary's economic and social
problems.
   The meetings are unusual in communist Hungary because
authorities, although they have not officially recognized the
forum, have not prevented them from taking place, and the results
have been discussed in the official press.
   Most of the speakers Sunday focused on the ethnic Hungarian
minority in Romania.
   Hungary and Romania are Warsaw Pact allies but have engaged in
increasingly sharp rhetoric over the question of the ethnic
Hungarian minority in Transylvania in recent months.
   Transylvania was ruled by Hungary before World War I, and both
nations claim the area is the cradle of their national cultures and
history.
   Hungarian officials say increasing numbers of Romania's nearly 2
million ethnic Hungarians have sought refuge in Hungary.
   Geza Szoecs, an ethnic Hungarian poet from Transylvania who now
lives in Switzerland, suggested that the Hungarian government
consider allowing a certain quota of ethnic Hungarians from Romania
emigrate to Hungary.
   He suggested the quota correlate to the number of Hungarians who
apply for asylum in the West each year, as well as the general
decline of the population through the sinking birthrate.
   However, Zoltan Kiraly, a member of Parliament, warned against
establishing a refugee program that would help Romanian Communist
leader Nicolae Ceausescu get rid of the Hungarian minority.
   Ethnic Hungarians have said they are increasingly restricted in
the use of their language and expression of their culture in
Romania, which denies the charges and accuses Budapest of meddling
in its affairs.
   Kiraly told the gathering he and five other parliamentarians
drafted a resolution calling on the government to set up a
settlement fund for Transylvanian Hungarians who wish to stay in
Hungary.
   He said the draft resolution, which is to be put before
Parliament when it meets in spring session later this month, also
calls on the government to seek the cooperation of the United
Nations and the International Red Cross and to mobilize
international public opinion.
   Kiraly, one of the most outspoken members of Parliament, said
many Hungarians who enter Hungary from Romania go on to third
countries because the Hungarian authorities are not prepared to
receive them.
   He said many of these ethnic Hungarians, if given the chance,
would opt to stay in Hungary because of the cultural affinity.

   Single women are changing their attitudes about
sexual relationships because of the threat of getting AIDS,
according to a poll conducted for People magazine.
   The national telephone survey, conducted by Market Facts of New
York, asked 500 women ages 18 to 49 about the impact of AIDS, the
magazine reported in this week's issue.
   The survey found that the threat was on their minds even though
the medical community has said very few AIDS cases have occurred
outside of the known risk groups, which include homosexuals and
intravenous drugs users, People said.
   The poll found that 75 percent said they were extremely or very
concerned and 40 percent said their sex lives had been directly
affected.
   Of those who said their sex lives have changed, 78 percent said
they've become more choosy about sex partners and three-fourths
said they want to know a new partner's sexual history and insist
that he use a condom, the poll said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Survivors and those who lost loved
ones in a ferry disaster retraced the voyage of the Herald Free
Enterprise, casting wreaths and notes over the spot where it
capsized a year before.
   ``Daddy, Miss You,'' said one of the more than 100 cards dropped
into the water Sunday, a cold, bleak day with a fine drizzle _
remarkably similar to the day the Herald turned over and 193 of its
passengers died.
   Others joined in prayer Sunday in this Belgian port and across
the North Sea in the English port of Dover to mark the worst
peacetime disaster involving a British ship since the sinking of
the Titanic in 1912.
   About 270 set out from Zeebrugge and stopped just outside the
harbor wall where the ferry capsized March 6, 1987, when water
rushed in through its open bow doors five minutes after it left
port.
   For 20 minutes they cast flowers onto the choppy seas from the
Baltic Ferry, which the Herald's owners P and O pressed into
service for the sad pilgrimage.
   Some were led away to be comforted by Red Cross and social
workers. Others clung to their families. A few went off by
themselves and stood looking into the murky waters.
   On the upper car deck, which was transformed into a makeshift
chapel bedecked with flowers, prayers were said by three clergymen
_ an Anglican, a Roman Catholic and a major from the Salvation Army
_ during a half-hour service.
   ``This service can mark a new beginning,'' said The Rev. Peter
Bowers, vicar of St. Peter's and St. Paul's Church in Dover. ``It
does not mean we forget those who we have loved. ... In fact, it is
from that memory that we build a new future.''
   His words were echoed by The Bishop of Dover, The Rt. Rev.
Richard Third, who told more than 600 bereaved at the Anglican
church of St. Mary The Virgin in Dover that it was time to leave
their grief behind.
   ``It is right to grieve. It is health-giving to express your
sorrow _ but you can't go on doing it for a lifetime. There must
come a moment when you surrender your grief, when you stop crying.''
   At St. Donaas Roman Catholic church across the road from
Zeebrugge port, the Sunday service was turned into a memorial for
the ferry victims.
   The Rev. Wim Catry also offered prayers that the survivors and
bereaved would be able to reconstruct their lives. He said in his
sermon that a rose garden and plaque would be unveiled in May in
front of the church to commemorate the dead.
   Andrew Parker, who turned his body into a human bridge so 20
passengers including his wife and daughter could walk across his
back to safety, paid his own private tribute.
   He went out on a Belgian tug to the spot where the Herald
capsized and with his 13-year-old daughter Janice dropped 193
flowers into the water, one by one. His wife, Eleanor, like several
other Britons who came here, remained onshore, unable at the last
minute to relive their nightmares.
   Said Mrs. Parker: ``I hate this day _ I just wish I could take
it off the calendar.''

<TEXT>
   An overwrought hockey fan was arrested
after he tossed a live chicken in a purple uniform onto the ice
during a game, police said.
   ``The chicken was the victim of fowl play,'' police Lt. Robert
Westlake quipped Sunday.
   Craig Rodenfels, 30, of El Segundo, was booked for investigation
of malicious mischief and cruelty to animals Saturday night and
released on his own recognizance Sunday, Westlake said.
   The chicken hit the ice just before the end of the first period
of the Los Angeles Kings' game with the Montreal Canadiens.
   ``Apparently he wasn't happy with how the Kings were playing,
which is understandable,'' Westlake said.
   Lt. Jack Frazier said Rodenfels smuggled the bird into the Forum
inside a sack. He said the man wasn't arrested before the chicken
hit the ice because ``there's no violation for carrying a chicken
around.''
   The purple-uniformed Kings fell to the Canadiens 7-6 in
overtime, their 39th loss of the season.
   The bird, which suffered minor bruises, was being held by county
animal control officers, Westlake said.
   ``The guy actually called us this morning and asked us to
release his chicken to him,'' Westlake said Sunday. ``Of course, we
declined because the bird is evidence.''

   Sanford and Linda Simmons have run
afoul of Orange County's sign code, but they want their six-foot
mechanical chicken to keep on clucking.
   ``We've got a lot of money tied up in this chicken, so we're
fighting back,'' Simmons said.
   The couple started a ``Save Our Chicken'' petition drive at
their Stuf'd Chicken restaurant and say they have about 500
signatures.
   The issue involves an ordinance prohibiting free-standing or
temporary signs in unincorporated parts of the county, said Gary
Boettcher, the Southern California county's enforcement manager.
   ``We're trying to improve the visual aspects of Sunset Beach,
and if everybody did this it would promote a garish image,''
Boettcher said. The restaurant faces fines or citations if they
don't take the chicken down.
   Simmons said the $800 mechanical chicken, which went up two
weeks ago, has proved an ideal replacement for reluctant teen-agers
he had been paying to stand by the side of the road dressed in
chicken outfits.
   ``It's hard to find people to be a chicken,'' he said.

rights activist was allowed to continue to his plane, said Sgt.
Charles Hyndman of the airport police.
   Williams ``said he had been cleaning his car out and took it out
of his car and put it in his briefcase but forgot to leave it in
his house,'' Hyndman said. Police reports did not say whether the
gun was loaded.
   The charge is a misdemeanor, and Williams could face up to
$1,000 in fines.
   Hyndman declined to give Williams' destination, and calls to the
councilman's home went unanswered.

   U.N.-sponsored Afghanistan peace talks resumed
today with uncertainty persisting over whether Pakistan is ready to
sign an agreement with the Soviet-backed Kabul government which it
does not recognize.
   Resumption of talks came after unprecedented consultations
between the Pakistani government and opposition leaders attended by
Islamabad's chief negotiator, acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani.
   Sources close to the meetings held during the weekend in
Pakistan said most of 19 opposition parties urged the government
not to stand in the way of the proposed pullout of the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops helping Kabul to fight Moslem insurgents.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said a withdrawal could
start in mid-May if a settlement is signed by next week.
   In an interview published today, Pakistani President Mohammad
Zia ul-Haq said his country will not budge from its demand for an
interim government in Kabul as part of a settlement.
   The Gulf News daily reported that Zia was optimistic that the
proposed peace accord on Afghanistan will be signed on schedule.
   ``There is no question of the accord not going through. Allowing
it to be dropped is no option,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Upon his return to Geneva Sunday night, Noorani said the
formation of a broad-based transitional government was as important
as the troop withdrawl in bringing peace to the region.
   ``Why should we not insist on an interim government,'' he said
in response to a question from a reporter at the airport.
   Last week Noorani said Pakistan would make up its mind after the
Islamabad consultations on whether to sign a settlement with the
present Kabul government of President Najib, which Pakistan does
not recognize.
   He put up only a cryptic smile when asked again before today's
session if Islamabad was now prepared to sign.
   Pakistan has insisted that any agreement on the withdrawal
Soviet troops should be linked to formation of an interim
government that is acceptable to all sides in the 9-year-old war.
   The Islamabad government says this is the only way to ensure the
safe repatriation of 5 million Afghan refugees from Pakistan and
Iran.
   Pakistan has been representing Afghan rebels at the
U.N.-sponsored talks, which began in 1982.
   The resistance movements, which say they represent 200,000
guerrillas, have rejected any power-sharing with Afghanistan's
President Najib and have presented a plan of their own for an
Islamic government.
   The Afghan government says its own policy of national
reconciliation envisages a ``coalition government'' open to all
political forces including the Pakistan-based resistance movements.
   The Soviet Union, which sent its troops in December 1979 to help
a faltering Marxist government suppress a Moslem insurrection, no
longer demands a transitional government be formed before
withdrawal.
   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. undersecretary general who has been
mediating the Afghan talks, said last week all major differences
had been resolved in the first three days of the new negotiating
round, which began last Wednesday.
   The two sides agreed on a nine-month timetable for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Cordovez said this
agreement, following years of stalling on the timetable issue,
represented a ``significant step'' toward a final political
settlement.
   The sides also agreed that half of the Soviet troops would leave
in the first three-month phase, the so-called ``front-end loading''
which had been a major concern of the United States.

   Iran and Iraq shot missiles into each
other's capitals today and both reported dozens of deaths as the
``war of the cities'' persisted between the two Persian Gulf war
foes.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 12 civilians,
including women and children, were killed and 30 wounded when an
Iraqi missile exploded in Tehran today. It said a hospital clinic,
several houses and 30 vehicles were destroyed in the blast.
   The missile was one of three Iraq said its army shot into Tehran
early today in the latest round of the bruising offensive that has
claimed hundreds of lives in both countries.
   IRNA said another 61 civilians were killed and 427 wounded
Sunday in Iraqi air raids on 16 Iranian cities and towns.
   The agency said schools and hospitals were hit in the wave of
Iraqi raids on the southern city of Shiraz and Dezful, Arak
Khorramabad and other population centers in the west. Eight other
people were wounded in missile strikes on Tehran on Sunday, it said.
   It said Iraqi artillery was shelling the northwestern border
town of Marivan, but made no mention of casualties or damage.
   Baghdad communiques said Iraqi fighter-bombers flew 118 combat
missions against ``military and economic targets'' in 12 Iranian
cities Sunday in retaliation for ``criminal attacks on Iraqi
civilian areas.''
   IRNA reported that Revolutionary Guards fired four missiles into
Baghdad today.
   It said they were aimed at ``military centers.'' Baghdad said
the first two missiles crashed into residential sections of the
capital, killing or wounding ``many civilians, including women and
children.''
   The agency said Iraq retaliated by firing three long-range ``Al
Hussein'' missiles, named after a 7th Century Shiite Moslem saint,
into Tehran today.
   INA quoted a military communique as saying: ``Iran's rulers must
realize their weakness and stop fighting.''
   The eight-day missile exchange has been the fiercest since the
gulf war began in September 1980 and the first time that Tehran has
been hit by missiles.
   Iraq says it has fired 41 projectiles into the Iranian capital
since the eye-for-an-eye missile duel began Feb. 29, when Iran sent
two missiles crashing into Baghdad.
   Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, admitted Saturday
that ``more than 30'' missiles had hit Tehran.
   The Iranians have reported firing 22 missiles in that period,
but the Iraqis have only acknowledged 18 hits.
   Iran has reported at least 106 civilians killed and more than
200 wounded in the Iraqi missile blitz, with more than 100 killed
and more than 500 wounded in air raids over the last week.
   Iraq has reported heavy civilian casualties, but has given no
numbers.

   A special education student says no other
youths moved to help her when two boys raped her in a classroom,
and when the bell rang at the end of the period they left laughing.
   The Magee resident also said two boys charged with the rape at
Magee High School had harassed her for about two years.
   ``Me and (he) fight every day,'' the 16-year-old girl said in a
weekend interview with The Clarion Ledger at her parents' rural
Simpson County home. ``He just picks on me and call my mom and
daddy names.''
   The girl said she was raped by two male students on Feb. 26
while she and other students were in study hall under the
supervision of teacher John Grantham, who said he had gone to check
on a school bus he drives when the attack occurred.
   The girl, who has a learning disability, and her family agreed
to discuss the attack if their identities weren't disclosed, the
newspaper said Sunday.
   The girl said the youths, ages 15 and 17, grabbed her around the
neck when she and another girl went to sharpen their pencils. They
grabbed the other girl, too, but let her go, she said.
   ``They carried me in the back of the room. I told them to leave
me alone.''
   The girl said the youths pulled off her underwear, and each
raped her twice, she said.
   ``One was holding me,'' she said. ``Every time I tried to get
up, they hold me down.''
   The attack occurred within sight of several other students, she
said. All the students in the study hall, except for one of the
attackers, were regular students, said Betty Dickson, Simpson
County School Board chairwoman.
   One of the boys is educably mentally retarded, according to
special education director John Hardy.
   No one stopped the attack, the girl said, even though she told
the other girl at the pencil sharpener to alert a principal or
teacher.
   ``When the bell rang, they walked out the door, laughing,'' she
said.
   The girl's father said he is as upset with school officials as
he is the two boys. ``I send them to learn, not to be going down
there to get raped,'' he said.
   The father said he called police and took his daughter to Magee
General Hospital that night to be examined.
   The two youths were arrested Thursday, charged with rape and
jailed in lieu of $50,000 bond each. Although they will be tried as
adults, officials refused to release their names.
   Dickson said school officials are planning counseling for the
girl.

   Arab guerrillas in southern Israel
hijacked a passenger bus today and held it for three hours before
Israeli troops stormed it, killing three gunmen. Three Israeli
civilians also were killed and eight were wounded, an army
communique said.
   Israel's state-run radio said the terrorists infiltrated from
Egypt and were armed with fragmentation grenades, assault rifles
and a submachine gun.
   A man claiming to represent the Palestine Liberation
Organization's Force 17 phoned a Western news agency in Jerusalem
and claimed responsibility for the hijacking.
   Israel radio said a PLO spokesman in Tunis told CBS news the
group was not responsible for the attack. But a survivor from the
bus said she heard the Arab gunmen say they were from Fatah, the
PLO faction headed by Yasser Arafat.
   A special anti-terrorist unit and border police stormed the bus,
which was loaded with nuclear plant workers and hijacked near the
Aroer junction eight miles from the Dimona nuclear facility.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir linked the attack to the rioting
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``These are the same people who incite violence in the
(occupied) territories. We shall not tire from fighting them,''
said Shamir.
   He noted today's attack was the second infiltration in two days.
Three Palestinian guerrillas were killed by army soldiers on Sunday
after they tried to cross the Lebanon border.
   Israel radio and officials said the terrorists came across the
lightly guarded border from Egypt at night near Ramat Nafha and
commandeered an Israeli military automobile at about 7 a.m.
   The Arab guerrillas drove the Renault-4 towards the
Beersheva-Dimona highway, throwing a hand grenade at an Israeli
semi-trailer but causing no injuries.
   The army and witnesses said a Volvo bus with the nuclear workers
was coming from the opposite direction, and the gunmen fired at the
bus and threw grenades until it stopped.
   Most of the passengers and the driver escaped but a man and nine
women remained, the radio said.
   The last bus hijacking inside Israel occurred on April 12, 1984,
when four bomb-weilding Palestinians hijacked an Israeli bus near
the Mediterranean coastal city of Ashdod. A soldier was killed on
the bus when Israeli troops stormed the vehicle and captured the
hijackers.
   Officials at Soroka Hospital in Beersheva said eight women were
admitted for treatment of gunshot wounds.
   Police forced the bus to stop after the terrorists fired from
the bus at passing people and cars. Police closed the area, and
army officers entered into negotiations with terrorists.
   The Arab gunmen demanded to speak with representatives of the
International Red Cross and also asked for a loudspeaker.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of Israel's southern
region, decided to storm the bus rather than negotiate further
after the gunmen opened fire.
   ``We made every effort to both relax them and to promise them
that negotiations may bring results,'' Mordechai told reporters at
the scene.
   ``(But) they fired at us twice and afterwards they fired and
killed one of the hostages and fired at women who were inside the
bus,'' he said.
   In all, he said, the storming operation lasted about a minute.
   Mordechai said the man was killed by Arab gunmen during
negotiations. He said shots fired by the terrorists when the bus
was stormed appeared to have killed the women.
   The victims were not identified, apparently because of the
sensitivity of their jobs.
   At the hospital, David, a curly-haired man in his late 20s, said
he saw armed terrorists block the blue Volvo bus, a special
commuter vehicle carrying women workers from a plant in Dimona.
   ``The terrorists blocked the bus and didn't give the driver a
chance to turn around and get away,'' he said. ``The driver opened
the door and many of the passengers scrambled out. About a
half-dozen remained on the bus.''
   David said the bus hijacking began about 7:30 a.m. and he
watched the hijacking from another bus. He declined to give his
last name.
   Rafi Hayon, a motorist traveling the Beersheva-Dimona highway,
said the Arab gunmen armed with Soviet-made automatic rifles shot
at his car when he refused to stop for them.
   ``I saw only two Kalashnikovs in front of my eyes,'' he said in
an interview broadcast by Israel radio.
   It was the bloodiest attack by Palestinian guerrillas since a
hang-glider attack in late November in which a guerrilla landed in
northern Israel and shot to death six Israeli soldiers and wounded
eight.
   The Dimona plant is at the center of a secret trial now going on
in Israel.
   Mordechai Vanunu, a former nuclear technician at Dimona,
revealed Israel's atomic secrets to The Sunday Times of London in
an expose published Oct. 5, 1986. Based on Vanunu's information,
the newspaper concluded Israel possessed the world's sixth largest
nuclear arsenal.
   In the Sunday Times story, Vanunu detailed the route taken by 40
blue and white Volvo buses he said transported workers to the
nuclear plant each day.
   Vanunu, 33, was tried on charges of treason and espionage for
revealing Israel's nuclear capability and the three-judge panel in
the closed-door trial is currently deliberating its verdict.

   A 15-year-old boy described as despondent over
school problems and upset about the outcome of a college basketball
game blasted away with an assortment of rifles and handguns for
five hours inside his home, officials said today.
   No one was injured in the incident, which ended when deputies
talked the boy into surrendering early today, said Monroe County
sheriff's spokesman Thomas Ryan.
   ``The house is a shambles,'' Ryan said this morning. ``He shot
out the television, the stove, the walls and ceilings, windows,
sliding glass doors, a water pipe which ruptured and squirted water
everywhere, and even the electrical box in the basement.''
   Ryan said the boy, whose name was withheld because of his age,
had picked up a gun and started shooting Sunday night. His mother
ran next door to call police.
   When deputies arrived at the house in the rural area southwest
of Rochester, they heard bullets whizzing by their heads and
evacuated the house next door. Deputies then set up a command post
in a house down the road, from which negotiators talked to the
youth by telephone, Ryan said.
   Before the boy surrendered early Sunday morning he had fired at
least 300 rounds of ammunition had been fired from a variety of
weapons, Ryan said. The boy's father had four or five rifles and
shotguns and four handguns, Ryan said.
   ``The boy had been suspended from high school last week for
disciplinary problems,'' Ryan said. ``Whether this triggered him,
we don't know. The only other thing he mentioned to hostage
negotiators was that he was upset that Syracuse lost to
Pittsburgh.''
   Pittsburgh edged Syracuse University 85-84 to take the Big East
Conference college basketball title Sunday afternoon.
   The youth was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester for
a mental examination before being turned over to family court
officials, said Ryan.

<HEAD>Court Will Try Again to Decide on Suing Cities in Ohio Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will try again
to decide whether cities may be sued successfully when citizens'
rights are violated due to alleged inadequate training of municipal
employees.
   The justices said they will study the issue in an appeal by
Canton, Ohio, officials.
   The city is seeking to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police
violated her rights by failing to provide her medical attention
after she was arrested for speeding.
   The justices last year backed out of deciding the
municipal-liability issue in a case from Springfield, Mass.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court declined for procedural reasons to
decide whether Springfield should be forced to pay damages in the
death of a fleeing motorist killed by a policeman's bullet.
   The ruling left intact a $50,000 damage award the city was
ordered to pay to the victim's family.
   The case acted on today involves Geraldine Harris, who was
granted a retrial of her lawsuit by a lower court.
   Canton officials said alleged inadequate training of police in
summoning medical help should not be the basis for a lawsuit
against the city.
   Mrs. Harris' lawsuit grows out of an April 26, 1978, incident in
which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teen-age
daughter to school.
   Police said they put Mrs. Harris into a patrol wagon after the
52-year-old woman became upset and uncooperative. On arrival at the
police station, the officers said she was lying on the floor of the
vehicle.
   She repeatedly slumped to the floor during a stay of 30 to 40
minutes at the stationhouse.
   Police officers did not call for medical help. They said they
believed Mrs. Harris was merely excited and would calm down if left
alone and permitted to see her family.
   When family members arrived, they had Mrs. Harris taken by
ambulance to a hospital where she was diagnosed as suffering from
stress reaction, anxiety and depression. The symptoms included
immobility and difficulty in breathing. She was under psychiatric
care for more than a year later.
   The Harris family sued the city in federal court, and a jury
awarded $200,000 against the city on grounds Mrs. Harris
unreasonably was denied medical attention.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the verdict last
July, saying it was unclear on what theory the damage award was
based.
   The judge's instructions to the jury could have allowed it to
decide erroneously that the city was at fault even if the failure
to summon medical attention was not the result of a city policy,
the appeals court said.
   ``This instruction allows a finding of municipal liability
merely because (the city's) supervisory personnel did a bad act,
with no need to find that the city was a bad actor through a city
policy or custom. This was error,'' the appeals court said.
   Canton officials asked the Supreme Court to throw out the
lawsuit.
   City officials said the 6th Circuit court ruling will allow the
city to be found liable for misconduct at the retrial under an
unreasonably broad theory.
   The city may be forced to pay damages if the jury decides that
police were not trained adequately to summon medical help in such
cases, city officials said.
   The appeals court ruling will impose ``the novel requirement
upon cities that their police forces must provide paramedical
officers or other trained medical specialists who exercise some
type of professional judgment at the jail,'' city officials said.
   The Supreme Court recently has had trouble providing clear
guidelines on the issue of inadequate police training as grounds
for municipal liability in federal civil rights suits .
   In a 7-1 ruling in 1985 the justices threw out a $1.5 million
award against Oklahoma City in the shooting death of a tavern
patron by a police officer.
   Only four justices agreed it was a mistake for the jury to be
told it could infer from a single incident that the city was
grossly negligent in its police training. Three other justices
voted to throw out the award for other reasons.
   The case is Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088.

   A white student editor testified before a
Dartmouth College disciplinary panel that his staff was ``polite''
and did not harass a black professor in an incident that sparked
racial turmoil at the Ivy League school.
   But professor William Cole told the panel, which met over the
weekend, that the four white staff members of the conservative
Dartmouth Review were bigots and said he was harassed by them.
   The students said they were acting as journalists when they
confronted Cole on Feb. 25, several days after the off-campus
newspaper published an article sharply criticizing Cole.
   The disciplinary board will begin deliberating the fate of the
four reporters tonight. They face possible expulsion on charges of
harassment, disorderly conduct and invasion of privacy for taking
Cole's picture and recording him without his consent.
   The Committee on Standards heard nearly 16 hours of testimony
Saturday and Sunday concerning last former Review staffers made up most
of the roughly 25 people
watching the hearings, looked at each other with expressions of
disbelief.
   ``I think it had racial overtones, yes,'' said freshman Suzanna
Dotson after the hearing. ``He was saying without directly saying
that Professor Cole, who is of color, comes from a violent
background and that the four students, who are white, did not.''
   The defendants were Baldwin, Review photo editor John Quilhot,
executive editor John Sutter, and contributor Sean Nolan.

   U.S. Navy helicopters dodged heavy
machine-gun fire in the Persian Gulf and Iran today claimed
responsibility for the attack which came after the helicopters
ignored a warning to stay clear of an ``Iranian zone.''
   The account carried by Tehran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency evidently referred to the incident Saturday night reported
earlier by U.S. officials.
   They said American helicopters took ``evasive action'' when
fired on from an oil platform and several small boats in the
central gulf about midnight Saturday.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said there was no connection between
the helicopter incident and the movement of six U.S. warships up
the gulf today.
   The ships' appearance off Dubai triggered speculation that the
United States was planning to retaliate for the shooting Saturday.
   All six, including a missile cruiser, three missile frigates, a
combat stores ship and a chartered Navy tanker, were part of
``routine movement, not connected with any other recent events in
the gulf,'' said Lt. Col. John Head, a spokesman for the U.S.
Central Command.
   Saturday's helicopter incident occurred as the aircraft were
scouting ahead of the missile frigate Simpson, returning up the
gulf after a convoy escort mission.
   A U.S. statement said the helicopters took evasive action and
did not return fire when the Iranians shot at them.
   It did not say what kind of helicopters were involved or how
many there were. Nor did the statement mention any warning by the
Iranians before they started shooting.
   The platform was not identified by name or exact location,
although the statement said it was not the Rostam platform. Rostam
was shelled by U.S. destroyers last October in a retaliatory raid
after an Iranian Silkworm missile hit a U.S. flagged Kuwaiti
tanker, the Sea Isle City, anchored off Kuwait.
   The Iranian account said: ``Two U.S. helicopters attempting to
approach an Iranian zone in the Persian Gulf early Sunday were
forced to flee by the anti-aircraft fire of naval forces of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.''
   It added: ``The navy anti-aircraft (unit) detected the two
helicopters on its radar and warned them to stay out of the Iranian
zone. However, the Iranian navy fired warning shots after the U.S.
helicopters violated the Iranian zone.''
   Shortly after midnight Friday, U.S. officials said the missile
frigate John A. Moore fired at what were believed to be Iranian
speedboats seen on the radar screen before they disappeared.
   Also Sunday, thousands of Iranians marched through central
Tehran to the Soviet Embassy, claiming Moscow had supplied Iraq
with long-range missiles, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said
in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   IRNA said a number of students entered the embassy grounds by
scaling a wall, but were thrown out by ``alert policemen.'' Iran
said it first learned about Iraq's new missiles seven months ago
and had warned the Soviets that any use of the rockets would harm
relations between Tehran and Moscow, IRNA said.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said a mob besieged the
embassy, pelted it with rocks and tried to set fires, threatening
the lives of Soviet diplomats and their families. Similar ``hostile
actions'' were directed Sunday at the Soviet Consulate in Isfahan,
Iran, Tass said without elaborating.
   Tass said the Soviet leadership ``rejects any allegations about
the Soviet Union's involvement in the missile attacks against
Tehran.''
   In the so-called ``war of the cities,'' Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency said 12 civilians, including women and
children, were killed and 30 wounded when an Iraqi missile exploded
in Tehran today. It said a clinic, several houses and 30 vehicles
were destroyed in the blast. The missile was one of two Iraq said
its army lobbed into Tehran early today.
   IRNA said another 61 civilians were killed and 427 wounded
Sunday in Iraqi air raids on 16 Iranian cities and towns.
   It reported that Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired a missile at
a ``military center'' in Baghdad around midnight. The official
Iraqi News Agency said the missile exploded in a residential area
of the capital, killing and wounding ``a number of civilians,
including women and children.''

<HEAD>Air Ambulance Firm Accused Of Federal Rule Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Utah company that provides helicopters and
crews for a third of the nation's civilian air ambulance services
has been accused of violating federal aviation regulations,
probably unintentionally, a newspaper reports.
   Most of Rocky Mountain Helicopter Service's alleged violations
involved paperwork and record-keeping deficiencies, The Pittsburgh
Press reported Sunday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration findings stem from a
two-month investigation of the company's safety procedures and
regulation compliance, said Wayne Barlow, director of the FAA's
Northwest Mountain Region, which covers Rocky Mountain's
headquarters in Provo, Utah.
   The alleged violations are being reviewed and the final number
could be fewer than the 120 now pending, Barlow said.
   ``It looks like a case where a small company based in one
location grew very rapidly to the point where it had aircraft and
people operating in dozens of states and no real handle on how to
manage them,'' he told The Press.
   Rocky Mountain Helicopter, the industry's largest vendor,
supplies aircraft, pilots and mechanics to hospitals in 39 cities,
including Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   Barlow said Rocky Mountain Helicopters faces possible fines
because the investigation uncovered a number of significant
problems. However, he said, the FAA believes Rocky Mountain is now
operating in compliance with regulations and the agency had no
plans to lift their license to fly.
   Russ Spray, the company's vice president of emergency medical
services operations, said, ``We don't deny we made some mistakes,
but we're fixing them as fast as they're being pointed out.''
   The inspection was spawned by congressional pressure on the FAA
last year after a record medical helicopter accident rate in 1986,
but the FAA said it also wanted to become more acquainted with the
medical helicopter industry.
   There are more than 235 medical helicopter programs operating at
least 500 helicopters in 46 states.
   ``What we learn from Rocky Mountain will help us to manage the
whole industry better,'' Barlow said.
   The FAA's 143-page report referred to such shortcomings as a
lack of documented training in evacuating patients from the
aircraft in emergencies, The Press reported.
   Other alleged violations ranged from a lack of training for the
company's pilots to the failure of the director of operations and
chief pilot to have the proper FAA licenses for those positions,
the newspaper said.
   On Feb. 12, Rocky Mountain voluntarily grounded 62 of its
helicopters until mechanics in each city could confirm all
maintenance and accompanying paperwork were up-to-date and accurate.
   ``In most cases, this (grounding) just took long enough for a
phone call to each city, but three aircraft were grounded for a day
or so for repairs,'' Spray said.
   On Feb. 17, Rocky Mountain grounded 24 of its pilots because
they did not have the proper paperwork to show they had received
required training.
   ``Within two days, all the pilots were flying legal again,''
Spray said.

<HEAD>Secret Service Received Material On Pro-Choice Group Before Papal
Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic bishops' conference gave the
Secret Service information on an abortion rights group that planned
peaceful demonstrations during Pope John Paul II's trip to the
United States, a newspaper reports.
   Frances Kissling, president of Washington, D.C.-based Catholics
for a Free Choice, said she was surprised by the action.
   The information on the group was provided by the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, sponsor of the papal visit, which
is the religious arm of the civil U.S. Catholic Conference, the
Houston Chronicle reported Sunday.
   ``I think it is totally inappropriate for the U.S. Catholic
Conference to be cooperating with government agencies in the
collection of data that they know has no relevance to the physical
safety of the pope,'' Ms. Kissling said.
   ``There has been within the church anincreasing attempt to
silence and punish individuals who exercise their rights to
disagree with the bishops on public policy,'' she added. ``I think
that represents a kind of McCarthyism in the church.''
   Ms. Kissling said there is no evidence the Secret Service
conducted surveillance on her organization.
   The Chronicle reported Sunday it was unclear how or if the
Secret Service, which was in charge of the pope's security during
the Sept. 10-19 trip, used the information about Ms. Kissling's
group.
   Richard Doerflinger, assistant director of the bishops' Office
for Pro-life Activities, said his 1985 report about Catholics for a
Free Choice was sent to the Secret Service along with several
membership letters and press releases on CFC letterhead that he had
obtained.
   Doerflinger said the Secret Service ``wanted to be sent any
materials about groups conducting protests so they would know what
to expect.''
   The Secret Service released the material from its files in
response to questions from the Chronicle under the Freedom of
Information Act about monitoring of U.S. organizations in
connection with the papal trip.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for King's Libel Lawsuit Against Boston Globe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today cleared the way for a
jury trial in former Massachusetts Gov. Edward J. King's $3.6
million libel lawsuit against the Boston Globe.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact a
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling that a jury should hear
King's contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column
written by David Farrell, who since has left the newspaper.
   The state court ruled that a jury might conclude that one
allegation in the column had been published with ``actual malice''
_ a reckless disregard for the truth.
   Justice William J. Brennan in November blocked a libel trial,
and the full Supreme Court later refused to set aside Brennan's
order.
   Today's action set aside Brennan's trial-blocking order. Brennan
voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to
grant such review.
   King sued over various Globe articles and editorial cartoons
published in 1981.
   The state court threw out most of the ex-governor's claims in
pretrial proceedings, but said a jury trial was needed regarding
the Farrell column. Both the Globe Newspaper Co. and Farrell were
named as defendants.
   In it, King was criticized for treating legislative and judicial
figures as if they were his employees.
   ``That condescending attitude never was more evident than in
October when King called a judge and demanded that he change a
decision he rendered in a gang-rape case,'' the column said.
   In a much-publicized case, the judge had given a suspended
prison sentence to five men who pleaded guilty to rape.
   King's lawsuit said no such conversation between King and the
judge took place.
   State Treasurer Robert Q. Crane, a King political ally, said in
pretrial testimony that he was Farrell's source about King's
telephone call to the judge.
   But the state's highest court noted that Farrell was not told
that Crane had overheard the conversation, and that Farrell did not
investigate further.
   The court said a jury conceivably could conclude that Farrell's
failure to do so amounted to actual malice.
   Public figures who sue for libel must prove that the allegedly
libelous statement is false and was made with actual malice.
Private citizens have a less stringent burden, and must prove only
that the statement is false and was made negligently.
   In a pretrial deposition, Farrell said he had no reason to doubt
Crane's ``veracity and accuracy.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Globe lawyers said the
Massachusetts court ruling ``mutates actual malice into negligence,
thus eviscerating'' the free-speech protections the Supreme Court
has built into libel law since 1964.
   ``As long as writers are exposed to liability solely for the
asserted inadequacies of their investigations, speech protected
under the Constitution will be chilled,'' the newspaper's lawyers
said. ``Stories for which reliable sources exist may be
self-censored out of existence.''
   But lawyers for King urged the court to reject the appeal and
allow a jury trial on the libel allegation.
   ``Farrell had obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of Crane's
report,'' they said.
   The newspaper's appeal was supported in a
``friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, the American Society of Newspaper Editors
and other news organizations.
   The case is Globe Newspaper Co. vs. King, 87-731.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the death sentence of a Florida man convicted of
killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978.
   The court is expected to use the case to study death row
inmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal
courts for help and to decide whether Florida juries may be told
their life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trial
judge's approval.
   Aubrey Adams, who once worked as a corrections officer at the
Marion Correctional Institution in Ocala, was convicted of the Jan.
23, 1978, strangulation of Trisa Gail Thornley near Ocala.
   His conviction and death sentence have been upheld three times
by the Florida Supreme Court. The nation's highest court refused to
review his case twice.
   In the second federal court appeal, Adams in early 1986
challenged statements made to the jury by the judge in his state
court sentencing trial.
   Under Florida law, a jury recommends life or death for convicted
murderers in capital cases. The presiding judge is free to follow
or disregard the recommendation.
   In Adams' case, the judge told jurors about that aspect of the
state's capital-sentencing law. ``The final decision as to what
punishment shall be imposed rests solely upon the judge of this
court,'' the jury was told.
   Adams argued that such jury instructions run afoul of a 1985
Supreme Court decision in which the justices, ruling in a
Mississippi case, said a death sentence is invalid if a jury is
misled about its role in determining whether the defendant actually
will die.
   In the case, a Mississippi prosecutor had told jurors they
should not view themselves as determining life or death because
their sentence would be reviewed automatically by an appeals court.
   The Supreme Court said such a statement misled the jury, and
rendered the subsequent death sentence ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   A federal judge dismissed Adams' 1986 appeal but the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last Nov. 13 threw out his sentence.
   The appeals court said the judge's instructions to jurors
violated the Supreme Court's 1985 decision, adding that Adams was
entitled to ``a new sentencing proceeding before an untainted
jury.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Florida prosecutors noted that the
Florida Supreme Court previously had rejected an appeal in which
Adams mounted an identical challenge to the judge's instructions to
jurors.
   They asked the justices to resolve the conflict between the
state's highest court and the 11th Circuit court.
   The state's appeal also contended that Adams' challenge should
not have been allowed because he did not raise it in his first
federal court appeal.
   The case is Dugger vs. Adams, 87-121.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Free Churches from Financial-Disclosure Laws in
Tennessee Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to free
churches from having to comply with state financial-disclosure laws
when waging public referendum campaigns.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from Jackson,
Tenn., to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and
freedom of speech.
   The Tennessee law also affects other non-political organizations
that decided to campaign for or against issues that appear on
election ballots.
   The controversy arose during an August 1984 election held in
Jackson to determine whether establishments within the city would
be allowed to sell liquor by the drink.
   The local option referendum was defeated by a vote of 6,514 to
6,474 _ a 40-vote margin.
   The 13 area churches, nine of them Baptist-affiliated, took
varying steps to make public their opposition to allowing
on-premise liquor consumption in Jackson.
   The churches spent a total of $5,150, mostly for advertising, in
opposition to the referendum. But they failed to register as
``political campaign committees'' as required by the Tennessee
Campaign Financial Disclosure Act of 1980.
   The law defines such committees as any combination of two or
more people ``making expenditures to support or oppose any
candidate for public office or measure.'' It requires that the
committees designate a political treasurer and file
campaign-disclosure statements.
   The churches sued the state to challenge the law as applied to
them.
   At trial, pastors for the churches testified that the referendum
opposition resulted from moral, not political, concerns and that
they considered their actions to be part of the churches' religious
mission.
   The pastors also testified that their churches had not, and
would not, get involved in partisan political campaigns as a matter
of religious conviction.
   A state trial judge ruled against the churches, finding that all
of them are ``political campaign committees'' as defined by the
1980 state law and that the law is constitutional.
   A state appeals court later overturned the state law as a
violation of constitutional free-speech rights.
   The Tennessee Supreme Court last May 26 ruled that the law does
not violate free-speech rights when applied to either partisan
elections featuring candidates or non-partisan referendum elections.
   ``The recent history of campaign financial abuses as well as the
growth and possible dominance of special interest political action
committees make the state's disclosure requirements necessary to
allow the public to have some gauge by which to assess the sources,
content and frequency of campaign publicity and activity,'' the
state court ruled.
   Its ruling did not discuss the churches' argument that the law
violates their right to exercise freely their religious beliefs.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the 13 churches noted
that the justices have ``never passed on the validity of disclosure
requirements in referendum campaigns.''
   The appeal questioned whether any state may justify ``prior
registration and disclosure requirements to non-political
organizations in general and churches in particular.''
   Tennessee Attorney General W.J. Michael Cody urged the high
court to reject the churches' appeal.
   ``The fact that this is a referendum election does not make the
state's interest in providing any information to the voters as to
how the election is financed any less compelling,'' Cody said.
   The 13 churches who challenged the law are Bemis Pentecostal,
Calvary Baptist, Englewood Baptist, First Assembly of God, First
Baptist Church of Bemis, First Baptist Church of Jackson, Malesus
Baptist, North Jackson Baptist, Northside Assembly of God, Poplar
Heights Baptist, Skyline Church of Christ, West Jackson Baptist and
Woodland Baptist.
   The case is Bemis Pentecostal vs. Tennessee, 87-317.

   Sen. Sam Nunn, whose support is considered
important in the South, says he has cast his absentee ballot for
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in Tuesday's Democratic presidential
primary in Georgia.
   Nunn, D-Ga., in a statement released Sunday by aides as he was
leaving for a week-long trip to the Soviet Union, said he voted for
Gore because ``his views come closest to my own views as to the
steps our nation must take to meet our challenges at home and
abroad.''
   Nunn had refused on Friday during a news conference with Georgia
reporters to disclose how he voted, saying his position as chairman
of the Democratic Leadership Council precluded him from taking a
public stand between Gore and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, both
members of the DLC.
   But he said in his statement Sunday that since that news
conference he had eceived ``a number of inquiries from Georgians
asking me privately whom I had favored in the March 8 primary
election.''
   ``Because I have responded frankly to these private inquiries, I
feel that it is now more appropriate for me to state publicly what
I have stated privately _ I voted for Al Gore,'' Nunn said.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Criminal Trials in Louisiana Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that the public has no right to attend hearings into the alleged
tainting or bribing of a criminal trial jury while the trial is
underway.
   The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess the
validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986
racketeering trial of Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards.
   A federal appeals court, in upholding the closed hearings, ruled
that the public's constitutional right to attend criminal trials
does not extend to ``the midtrial questioning of jurors.''
   The appeals court also ruled that transcripts of the closed
hearings may be withheld from public disclosure during the trial
even if the jury is sequestered, and that the names of the jurors
involved may be erased from the transcripts.
   After a 1985 trial ended in mistrial because a federal jury
could not reach a unanimous verdict, then-Gov. Edwards and four
co-defendants stood trial again in 1986 on charges of racketeering
and bribery.
   All were acquitted after a two-month trial.
   On two occasions during the second trial, U.S. District Judge
Marcel Livaudais Jr. received reports that the sequestered jury had
been tainted.
   The first report suggested that one juror had told another that
jury members in Edwards' first trial were paid to vote for
acquittal.
   The second report suggested one juror had told another of a
possible bribery attempt by one defendant.
   In both instances, Livaudais conducted proceedings in his
chambers and determined that the people involved could continue
serving as jurors.
   Courtroom spectators, including news reporters, were given only
vague accounts of why the hearings were held. The judge said he
would release partial transcripts sometime after the trial was
completed, but that those transcripts would not include juror names.
   Three news organizations _ The Times-Picayune, Gannett News
Service and Capital City Press _ and several of their reporters
challenged the judge's use of closed hearings.
   The Times-Picayune is a New Orleans newspaper. Capital City
Press publishes the Morning Advocate and State-Times newspapers in
Baton Rouge.
   The challenge contended that Livaudais should have given the
reporters a chance to argue in favor of conducting open-court
hearings and that he was required to tell why it was necessary to
conduct the hearings in secret.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July 31 upheld the
closed hearings.
   The appeals court noted that past Supreme Court rulings have
established a public right of access to criminal trials but ruled
that under that constitutional right ``no presumption of openness
attaches to proceedings involving midtrial questioning of jurors.''
   ``If the questioning of impaneled jurors were held in open court
there is a substantial probability that what may have begun as a
`tempest in a teapot' will end in a mistrial, a hung jury or a
reversal on appeal,'' the 5th Circuit court said.
   The news organizations then sought Supreme Court review.
   The case is Times-Picayune Publishing vs. Edwards, 87-872.

<HEAD>Ambush Near U.S.-Run Base Kills Nine Filipinos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels ambushed and killed
six Filipino sailors assigned to Subic Naval base 10 miles from the
U.S.-run installation, the military said today. Three civilians
also died in the shootout.
   Philippine officials today urged President Corazon Aquino to
develop a unified negotiating strategy before talks on the future
of American bases in the Philippines.
   One of the country's best-known rebel priests fled to Cebu City
from Mindanao island after he was wounded by comrades who learned
he was planning to surrender, officials said today.
   The Philippine Constabulary said the Philippine sailors were
traveling to Manila Sunday when rebels opened fire on their land
rover near the town of Hermosa on the Bataan peninsula.
   Three civilians were killed in the cross fire during the
15-minute battle, the military said. There were no reports of rebel
casualties.
   Subic, 50 miles west of Manila, is one of six installations
technically under Philippine command but effectively under U.S.
control.
   Communist rebels operate near both Subic and Clark Air Base,
about 50 miles north of Manila. In October last year, rebels killed
three Americans and a Filipino of U.S. extraction in coordinated
attacks outside Clark.
   Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress' Foreign Affairs
Committee told reporters after a two-hour meeting today with Mrs.
Aquino that they would continue talks to firm up the government
position on U.S.-run bases.
   The United States and the Philippines are expected to begin
talks in the next few weeks on the future of the U.S.-run
installations. Under the current agreement, either government can
unilaterally close the bases if it serves one-year's notice after
Sept. 16, 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino says she will honor the current bases treaty but has
refused to say whether she will agree to extend the agreement. Any
extension beyond 1991 requires approval by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the bases is
strong.
   Sen. Leticia Shahani said matters to be discussed in the review
include the future of Filipino employees at the bases and the
possibility that nuclear weapons are being stored at the facilities.
   She said Mrs. Aquino is ``leaving us the liberty of taking a
stand. On the other hand there is a need to coordinate the
positions of the executive and the legislative.''
   Romeo Capangpangan, spokesman of the Department of Social
Welfare, said the rebel priest, Rev. Frank Navarro, sent word that
he was recuperating in a Cebu area hideout and wanted to surrender
and be granted amnesty.
   Navarro has been identified by the military as a New Peoples
Army commander in eastern Mindanao.
   Capangpangan said Navarro was apparently suffering from a bullet
wound in the shoulder which he received in an ambush by his own
followers last week in Mindanao's Surigao Del Sur province.
   Welfare Department official Amelita Costas told reporters that
her office was willing to meet Navarro at the place of his choice
and take him to safety without any military escorts.
   The government amnesty program for communist and Moslem rebels
expired at the end of February. But Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos
said rebels who wanted to surrender could receive amnesty on a
case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Charges Against 36 Arrested Outside
White House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
charges against 36 people arrested outside the White House while
protesting Reagan administration domestic and foreign policies.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that dismissed
the charges on grounds government prosecutors acted vindictively.
   A demonstration for ``peace, jobs and justice'' occurred April
22, 1985. About 200 participants were arrested.
   They were charged with violating the terms of their U.S. Park
Police march permit by sitting down on sidewalks outside the White
House.
   Most of those arrested agreed to pay a $50 fine for
demonstrating without a permit rather than stand trial.
   But 36 demonstrators chose to stand trial. They were charged _
in addition to demonstrating without a permit _ with obstructing
the sidewalks adjacent to the White House.
   Each charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison
and a $500 fine.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson ordered all charges against
the 36 dismissed, ruling that prosecutors acted vindictively by
bringing the second charge only for those who chose to stand trial.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Robinson's decision
last year.
   The appeals court said there was ample evidence for Robinson to
conclude that prosecutors added the second charge to punish
demonstrators for choosing to stand trial.
   ``A large group of defendants threatened to go to trial on what
the government considered petty offenses,'' the appeals court said.
``The government had a strong incentive to try to keep clear of
this courtroom morass. It wished to avoid the annoyance and expense
of prosecuting these minor cases at a potentially drawn-out trial.''
   Prosecutors showed a `` disturbing willingness to toy with the
defendants,'' the appeals court added.
   It said Robinson was justified in throwing out both charges
against the 36 demonstrators, not merely the second accusation that
they obstructed the sidewalks.
   ``If in cases of vindictive prosecution the trial court judge
may only dismiss the additional charge, the prosecutor wil have
nothing to lose by acting vindictively,'' the appeals court said.
   The Reagan administration said the lower court rulings could
``significantly hamper'' the government's handling off mass
demonstrations in the nation's capital.
   The case is U.S. vs. Meyer, 87-730.

   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a $3
million lawsuit by author William Peter Blatty against The New York

   The justices, without comment, let stand a California Supreme
Court ruling that dismissed Blatty's lawsuit alleging intentional
interference with prospective business advantage.
   Blatty, author of ``The Exorcist,'' contended that the Times
excluded ``Legion'' from the weekly list for a period even though
the newspaper knew the novel had sold enough copies to qualify.
   The California Supreme Court, by a 7-0 vote last Dec. 29, said
Blatty could not pursue the lawsuit.
   Four of the state court's justices based their ruling on the
federal Constitution's free-speech protections and the even greater
protections for speech offered by the California Constitution.
   They said such a lawsuit is barred unless a defendant has made a
statement ``of and concerning'' the plaintiff.
   Three of the state court's justices said Blatty had failed to
suggest that the newspaper intentionally misrepresented the results
of its bookstore sales survey to hurt him financially.
   The case is Blatty vs. New York Times, 86-1803.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for Trial in California Rent-Control Case</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today cleared the way for a
trial in what may become an important test case on the power of
cities to control rents and otherwise protect mobile home residents.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Santa Barbara,
Calif., officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by the owners of a
mobile home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of
their property's full value.
   A Santa Barbara ordinance adopted in 1984 requires mobile home
park operators to offer their tenants leases of unlimited duration.
It also permits a maximum yearly rent increase of 3 percent or
three-fourths of the increase in the Consumer Price Index,
whichever is greater.
   The ordinance was challenged by William and Jean Hall, who own
the Los Amigos Mobile Home Estates in Santa Barbara.
   They said their property is being ``taken'' without the ``just
compensation'' required by the Constitution.
   The Halls argued that granting mobile home owners a perpetual
lease allows them to sell the lease at a windfall profit. The
windfall is due to the new owners' anticipation of continued low
land rent at below-market rates, the Halls said.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it in 1986.
   The appeals court noted that the Halls said the price of mobile
homes in the park shot up dramatically after the ordinance was
enacted, suggesting the guaranteed low rents were worth a premium
to buyers.
   ``Reduced to its essentials,'' the appeals court said, the
Halls' claim ``is that the Santa Barbara ordinance has transferred
a possessory interest in their land to each of their 71 tenants.
This interest consists of the right to occupy the property in
perpetuity while paying only a fraction of what it is worth in
rent.''
   The appeals court acknowledged that the ordinance allows mobile
home owners to be removed if they don't pay the rent or if they
misbehave. That may ease the economic impact, the appeals court
said, but it does not alter the basic right of possession given the
home owners.
   The ordinance ``changes the fundamental relationship between the
parties, giving landlord and tenant complementary estates in the
same land,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court said a trial is necessary to determine if the
Halls' allegations about a windfall are accurate.
   Santa Barbara County and other cities in California joined in
asking the high court to review the case. The cities are Berkeley,
Capitola, Carson, Cathedral City, Fontana, Hayward, Los Altos, Los
Angeles, Mountain View, Oxnard, Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage,
Rialto, San Buenaventura, San Jose, San Luis Obispo, Santa Monica,
Vacaville, Vallejo, West Hollywood and Westlake Village.
   The justices on Feb. 24 expanded the power of communities to
impose rent controls by upholding a San Jose, Calif., ordinance
that allows hardships to tenants to be considered when landlords
seek rent increases.
   The ordinance had been atttacked as a ``Robin Hood'' law that
steals from the rich to pay the poor.
   The case is Santa Barbara vs. Hall, 87-220.

<TEXT>
   Jordan said today it welcomed the U.S.
peace initiative but insisted that the PLO participate in talks to
quell violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   Information Minister Hani Khasawneh said Amman will ``be
reporting to the U.S. administration as soon as we finish our
consultations'' with other Arab countries on the peace plan carried
to the Middle East last week by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``We always seek a united Arab stand toward any peace process in
the area,'' he said.
   He said there was no deadline for formulating a response to the
U.S. initiative. Shultz reportedly has asked Jordan, Syria, Egypt
and Israel to report back by the middle of the month.
   The American plan calls for an international conference to
launch bilateral talks between Israel and a Palestinian-Jordanian
delegation.
   The two sides would start in May to negotiate limited self-rule
for the 1.5 million Palestinians and in December would begin talks
on a final settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Israel's coalition government is split along party lines over
the American plan.
   The blueprint outlined by Shultz proposed an international peace
conference involving Jordan, Syria and Palestinian representatives,
but not the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Both the United States and Israel refuse to meet with the PLO
because they consider it a terrorist organization.
   The Jordanian minister renewed Jordan's call for an
international peace conference under U.N. auspices and attended by
all concerned parties in the conflict, including the PLO and the
Soviet Union.
   Asked if Jordan was optimistic, he said: ``We can't say so yet,
but we hope we'll get fruitful results.
   ``We're interested in a peace settlement and that's why we
welcome the U.S. movement,'' Khasawneh said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal of Jehovah's Witness in Florida Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear the
appeal of a Florida woman who says she was denied custody of her
young child because she is a Jehovah's Witness.
   The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings
that bar Rita Mendez from exposing her daughter to any of her
religious beliefs.
   The state courts also awarded primary residential custody of the
girl to her father.
   In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Mendez said her
freedom-of-religion rights were violated by the custody
determination.
   Rita and Ignacio Mendez were divorced in Miami in 1985, after a
four-year marriage. Their daughter, Rebecca, was then 3.
   Marital difficulties arose in 1983 over Mrs. Mendez's
involvement with the Jehovah's Witnesses religion. Her husband is a
Catholic who, according to court documents, felt his wife had
``betrayed him'' by joining the Jehovah's Witnesses.
   At a custody trial, Mendez testfieid that it was not in
Rebecca's best interest to be raised as a Jehovah's Witness. Of the
485 pages in the divorce proceedings transcript devoted to child
custody, 249 pages contain references to the subject of religion.
   Two psychologists and one psychiatrist testified that Rebecca
should live with her mother, whom they called the child's ``prime
parent figure.''
   But the experts said contact with her mother's Jehovah's Witness
religion was not in Rebecca's best interest because she needs ``to
adapt herself to the mainstream of culture.''
   They testified that a Catholic upbringing ``would allow her to
adapt to society and have the freedom that Catholic children have
in the society.''
   Judge Phillip K. Knight, in awarding primary custody of Rebecca
to her father, ruled that Mrs. Mendez should enjoy ``regular,
frequent and liberal visitation, access and contact with the minor
child.''
   But he also barred Mrs. Mendez from exposing Rebecca to ``any
religious practices, attendances, teachings or events which are in
any way inconsistent with the religious teachings and practices of
the Catholic religion.''
   A state appeals court upheld the custody award, ruling that
``the record in this case does not support (Mrs. Mendez's)
contention that the trial court made the father the primary
residential parent ... solely because the mother is a practicing
Jehovah's Witness.''
   In a dissenting vote, one appeals court judge said granting the
father primary custody amounted to ``an abuse of discretion.''
   ``The child, exposed to the religious views of both parents for
two years, showed no evidence of emotional or psychological harm,''
the judge said, adding that the custody proceedings showed ``the
experts' personal biases against the mother's religion.''
   ``Their disdain for the mother's religion induced them to
speculate as to the possibility of harm to the child in the future
even though no evidence of harm existed,'' the dissenting judge
said.
   Lawyers for Mrs. Mendez told the justices, ``This court cannot
eliminate religious bigotry in America but it can and should review
this decision, which has deprived a parent of her child because of
intolerance of her faith.''
   The appeal added, ``The trial court's order places Rita in the
anomalous position of having a constitutionally protected right to
speak to total strangers about her religion but not to her own
child.''
   The case is Mendez vs. Mendez, 87-1166.

   A co-worker and a relative of an
American kidnapped in Nicaragua last week by Contra rebels say they
have been told he is safe, but add that they don't trust the
Contras.
   Richard Boren, of Elkin, was among 12 people abducted Tuesday
from the village of Mancotal in northern Nicaragua.
   ``The main thing that my family wants is for him to be
released,'' said Carol Owens, Boren's sister, who lives in Carrboro.
   Contras, who oppose Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government,
claim the group was ``detained,'' not kidnapped.
   Boren, 30, is a long-term volunteer with Witness for Peace, a
U.S.-based grass-roots ecumenical group that works in the war zones
of Nicaragua trying to change U.S. policy toward the country.
   He has been in Nicaragua since November, assigned to travel from
town to town along the Honduran border recording witnesses' stories
of Contra attacks.
   Dennis Marker, director of the Washington office of Witness For
Peace, said Contras kicked down the door of a house in which Boren
was staying and began shooting, wounding a 13-year-old girl in the
leg.
   Boren was taken prisoner at gunpoint while trying to bandage the
girl's wound, Marker said.
   Six of the abductees have escaped since Tuesday, he said, and
one has told Witness For Peace specifics of the incident.
   ``The Contras still have Richard, and he obviously can't go
until they let him go,'' Marker said. ``I believe if they wanted
to, they could release him immediately.''
   ``We're not one bit happy that they're holding him, and we don't
trust them, quite frankly,'' Marker said.
   Marker said a Contra leader confirmed Friday only that they had
Boren and that he was safe.
   Ms. Owen, who said she didn't learn of the abduction until
Thursday night, said State Department officials told her Saturday
that her brother was all right.

<HEAD>Soviet, U.S. Students Discuss Nuclear Arms In Television Link-up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were differences in culture and style in a
television linkup between Soviet and American students and
scholars, but the students and 10 panelists agreed that the two
countries are making progress in breaking down barriers.
   The two-hour forum Saturday joined 350 undergraduates at Tufts
University's downtown campus with 200 Moscow State University
students.
   Not accustomed to the American style of TV answers, the Soviets
often strayed from the questioning and read prepared speeches
detailing minor points in Soviet nuclear history.
   At one juncture, Soviet moderator Yevgeny P. Velikhov said,
``It's a lecture. We have to teach the students something here.''
   Andrey Kokoshin, deputy director of the Institute for U.S.A. and
Canada, told a U.S. questioner the superpowers are moving past Cold
War tensions to begin ``to clear off layers of mutual fears.''
   ``It seems to me what we are doing now in a first step to
disarmament should create a new basis, a new faith to increase
trust in each other,'' Kokoshin said.
   The satellite-relayed ``space bridge'' forum was the first of
three between Tufts and Moscow State on the nuclear arms race and
Cold War politics. The sessions are part of a course devised by
Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin.
   The panel included two Americans who worked on the top-secret
Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bomb in 1945, and
a Soviet researcher who helped build that country's first nuclear
weapon in 1949.
   Students and scientists frequently interrupted each other with
applause, the loudest when Sherwin praised Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's efforts to ease nuclear tensions.
   ``I think there's not a single person here who thinks he will be
able to survive a nuclear bomb,'' said Alexei Milayev, a Soviet
physics student. ``We are gathered here in the final analysis to
think about what must be done to prevent a nuclear war.''
   Velikhov, vice president for physics and mathematics for the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, noted the forum came 40 years after the
U.N. Committee on Atomic Energy abandoned its effort to ban nuclear
weapons.
   ``Today we are at the first stages of a non-nuclear world,'' he
said. Velikhov said the recent superpower arms reduction treaty
signed in December ``is the first encouraging step. We believe, in
a new international situation, we will succceed in resolving the
question.''
   Mark Anstendig, 21, a Tufts junior history major from Edgemont,
N.Y., said afterward the forum went a long way to promoting better
understanding.
   ``I think there was good rapport on both sides,'' he said.
``It'll promote better feelings. I think it's a good microcosm of
what could happen.''

<HEAD>Government To Amend Constitution For Punjab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced plans today to
amend the constitution to make it easier to extend direct federal
rule in troubled state of Punjab, where Sikh militants have been
waging a bloody campaign for independence.
   P. Chidambaram, deputy home minister, told the governing lower
house of Parliament the amendments would only apply to Punjab.
   He said the amendments would allow the government to extend
direct federal rule for more than the one year presently allowed by
the constitution.
   Punjab's state government was dismissed in May 1987 for failing
to curb Sikh terrorism, and the state was placed under federal rule
for six months. The duration was extended for another six months.
   On Sunday the federal government went a step further and
dissolved the state assembly, paving the way for fresh elections.
   Chidambaram said articles of the constitution dealing with
emergency rule will be amended to enable the government to impose a
state of emergency on one state at a time.
   Under the current rules, a state of emergency can be imposed on
the whole country but not on individual states.
   At least 391 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
attacks blamed on Sikh extremists. More than 1,000 people were
killed last year.
   The minister, citing a government report on Punjab, said the
state assembly was dissolved because of the ``interference from
members of the legislative assembly in the effective and efficient
working of the police.''
   There were numerous reports, he said, when legislators ``not
only attempted to interfere, influence and prevent the police
action but also threatening police officers of dire consequences if
they failed to obey their commands,'' Chidambaram said.
   He claimed the imposition of direct federal rule had brought
about a ``distinct'' improvement in the situation in Punjab.
   The formal bill proposing the amendments is likely to come at
the end of the month. It is expected to pass easily since the
Congress Party of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has a majority in the
lower house.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Jury Award to Paralyzed Idaho Boy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $1.13
million jury award to an Idaho boy paralyzed from the waist down
after he was given a vaccination for three diseases.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the vaccine
manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to
abandon the production of essential vaccines.
   Lederle Laboratories, which makes the vaccine, said the case is
a test of how far juries should be allowed to go in compensating
people who suffer injuries after taking vaccines designed to
protect them from life-threatening deiseases.
   At stake are billions of dollars because of the ``unprecedented
explosion of vaccine liability litigation,'' said lawyers for
Lederle, a division of American Cyanamid Co.
   Lederle manufactures Tri-Immunol, a vaccine to immunize children
against diptheria, tetanus and pertussis. The company noted that
the vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, and
that only one other company markets a similar vaccine in the United
States.
   Kevin Toner of Burley, Idaho, was given the vaccine in 1979 when
he was three months old. He subsequently contracted a rare
condition of the spine known as transverse myelitis, which
permanently paralyzed him from the waist down.
   A federal jury found that Lederle's vaccine caused the boy's
paralysis, and decided that the drug company was negligent for
failing to develop an alternative vaccine that would have been
safer.
   Lederle contended that the judge's instructions to the jury were
indadequate because the jurors were not told that certain drugs are
unavoidably unsafe and that such vaccines may be sold despite the
risks.
   The company also said the verdict was impermissibly inconsistent
with the jury's rejection of other claims against Lederle.
   The company said the jury, in rejecting the other claims,
decided that Tri-Immunol was not defective and that there are
unavoidable risks in taking the vaccine.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld the
jury award.
   In rejecting the company's argument on inconsistency, the
appeals court said, ``It is not beyond peradventure that the jury
thought that Tri-Immunol was fit for the purposes for which it was
to be used but that Lederle was negligent in failing to replace it
with a better product.''
   The appeals court added, ``Were we charged with deciding whether
jury verdicts are the most sensible way of allocating risks and
costs regarding vaccines that have been proved beneficial, we might
well design a different method.''
   But it said the jury verdict did not violate Idaho law, adding
that any ``comprehensive reform'' in the area must be left to state
legislatures.
   The appeals court opinion was written by Anthony M. Kennedy, who
became a Supreme Court justice in February.
   The court's brief order today did not say that Kennedy
disqualified himself from considering the appeal. His participation
under the circumstances would be highly unusual.
   The case is Lederle Laboratories vs. Toner, 87-1151.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to allow an
Indian tribe to withhold from federal officials confidential
records of a tribal court proceeding.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that gave the
government custody of court records of the Red Lake Band of
Chippewa Indians in Minnesota.
   The tribe in 1985 declared that records of proceedings before
its court of Indian offenses are confidential and not the federal
government's property.
   The Chippewas were concerned that if the documents were given to
the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agency
would be forced to surrender the material to a newspaper that
sought the records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
   Indian tribes are not covered by the FOIA and may not be forced
directly to reveal confidential information to the news media.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the
Bureau of Indian Affairs is entitled to the material.
   The appeals court rejected arguments by the Red Lake Band that
only Congress could grant the government access to the records, and
ruled that the government has sovereignty over tribal courts
despite the absence of specific congressional authorization.
   The considerable independence given tribes to govern themselves
does not mean they have the power automatically to withhold
information from the government, the appeals court said.
   The Red Lake Band court of Indian offenses was established in
1884 under authority granted to the tribe by federal officials.
   The 8th Circuit court said that if the Chippewa court had been
created under a later federal statute, the Indian Reorganization
Act of 1934, the confidential records might be exempt from federal
control.
   The case is Red Lake Band vs. U.S., 87-950.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Pennsylvania Law on Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
Pennsylvania law forcing state police officers to retire at age 60.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the state
law violates federal restrictions against discrimination based on
age.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last June that
Pennsylvania violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment
Act.
   The appeals court said it is illegal to presume that officers
over 60 are physically unfit for their work when officials have
failed to adopt minimum fitness standards for all workers.
   ``Until minimum standards are developed, implemented and
enforced, the Pennsylvania State Police cannot justify its
mandatory retirement law by relying on good health and physical
conditioning as ... reasonably necessary to Pennsylvania State
Police business,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court noted that New Jersey, a neighboring state of
Pennsylvania, has a mandatory retirement age of 55 for state
troopers that has been upheld in the courts.
   But the appeals court said, ``All members of the New Jersey
State Police are subject to mandatory fitness requirements and are
sanctioned for non-compliance.''
   The federal law against age bias generally permits employers to
force workers to retire before 70 only if it can be shown that
being under 70 is a bona fide occupational qualification or if
employers can prove it is highly impractical to test workers
individually to assure they are still fit.
   The Supreme Court, in a pair of 1985 rulings that reinforced the
employment rights of older workers, struck down efforts to force
city firefighters to retire at age 55 and flight engineers at age
60.
   The 3rd Circuit court cited those cases in invalidating
Pennsylvania's mandatory retirement age for state police officers.
   Pennsylvania officials said the appeals court ruling places a
heavy financial burden on the state.
   The state said it could be forced to pay $4 million in back pay
and benefits to officers who have been forced to retire.
   Officials also said that testing state police officers for
fitness would be a costly process. They said it would cost some
$2.4 million to determine whether the force's 4,000 members are
healthy and fit.
   The state said its retirement-age policy is reasonable because
of statistics that show a sharp decline in average fitness and
health for older people.
   For example, the state said the decrease in aerobic capacity for
an average group of men aged 26 and an average group of men age 58
is 57 percent. Relative strength declines by about 35 percent
between the ages of 29 and 50 and muscular endurance slips by 30
percent between ages 30 and 60, the officials said.
   Pennsylvania's retirement law was challenged by the federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Otto J. Binker, a
lieutenant on the state police force who was near age 60 in 1983
when the suit was filed.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, 87-958.

   A crowd of 200 Eastern Airlines passengers who had
been bumped from New York-bound flights angrily confronted ticket
agents, and one man was arrested for assaulting police officers,
authorities said.
   Several similar scuffles have occurred at Miami International
Airport in recent months when Eastern flights to the Northeast were
cancelled.
   The latest incident took place at the airport Sunday when
members of the crowd pressed against a ticket stand demanding to
know if they could board the last flight to New York.
   One passenger went behind the stand and punched an Eastern
employee in the chest, said Metro-Dade police Lt. Robert Otero.
   Three officers struggled with the man, and one policeman fell to
the ground after hitting his leg on a trash can, said Otero.
   Police arrested Jack Lemonik, 36, of New York City, on charges
of simple battery, aggravated battery and resisting arrest with
violence, said Metro-Dade police spokesman James Wright.
   Passengers shouted angrily at police during the struggle with
Lemonik, said Curt Arnel, 30, an attorney from Merrick, N.Y.
   Eastern spokesman Bob Carson said 226 passengers were bumped
from a 3:15 p.m. Eastern flight to La Guardia. Some passengers were
then bumped repeatedly from later flights.
   Carson had no immediate explanation why so many people were
bumped from one flight. One previous incident occurred when
numerous passengers were bumped after a large jet was replaced by a
small one.
   Many of the bumped passengers were unable to board the last
flight and were put up for the night in hotels, said Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.

<HEAD>Casey's Widow Testifies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of former CIA director William J.
Casey testified today before the special federal grand jury that is
investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   Sophia Casey likely was questioned about what her husband might
have told her before his death last year about the sale of U.S.
arms to Iran to obtain the release of American hostages and whether
he mentioned anything about the diversion of proceeds to the
Contras.
   Casey, who died of pneumonia on May 6, 1987, after suffering
from brain cancer, was CIA director when U.S. arm were sold to Iran
in 1985 and 1986.
   The agency provided logistical support to covert operations to
help the Contras. Those operations were coordinated by former
National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.
   North told Congress that he was acting with Casey's approval and
that the former CIA director recommended that he recruit retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to set up the private supply
network because Secord had experience in special operations.
   Secord, who set up secret Swiss bank accounts to funnel private
donations to the Contras, also helped broker the sale of U.S. arms
to Iran with his partner, Albert Hakim.
   North told Congress last summer that Casey saw the diversion as
part of an effort to create a ``stand-alone'' or ``off-the-shelf''
enterprise that could engage in covert activities outside
congressional review.
   Mrs. Casey's testimony comes as the grand jury appears to be
preparing to return criminal indictments against the targets of the
investigation, including North, Secord, Hakim and former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter.
   Mrs. Casey, who lives in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y., last fall disputed
a published account by journalist Bob Woodward that Casey knew
about the diversion to the Contra rebels.
   In his book ``Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA,'' Woodward said
that during an interview in the hospital Casey acknowledged knowing
about the diversion.
   In a Sept. 28, 1987, interview, Mrs. Casey said her husband
never told her of the diversion and expressed doubt that he knew
about it.
   She termed ``absolute blasphemy'' Woodward's account that Casey
had criticized President Reagan as ``lazy and distracted.''
   ``He's lying about that,'' Mrs. Casey told The Associated Press.
   She described her husband as ``a team player'' and a ``great
patriot who would never do anything to harm his president.''
   Mrs. Casey also expressed outrage at Woodward's report that
Casey was ``struck by the overall passivity of the president.''
   ``Bill would never say that about the president,'' she said.
``Bill loved Reagan and they were very close. It's been very
hurtful.''

<HEAD>Justices Will Weigh Racketeering Law in Indiana Adult Bookstore
Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 14-28, In other action, with other cases.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult
bookstores.
   The court said it will review a pair of free-speech challenges
to such an Indiana law.
   Under Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
law, patterned after the much-used federal RICO act, law
enforcement officials are authorized to seize any property used in
a racketeering enterprise.
   The law was invoked in March 1984 against three Fort Wayne
bookstores selling sexually explicit materials, each accused of at
least two violations of the state's obscenity laws.
   Law enforcement officials padlocked the stores and seized their
nventories.
   A short time later, similar legal action was taken against three
adult bookstores in Indianapolis.
   The three Fort Wayne bookstores were allowed to reopen in April
1985 but only one, Fort Wayne Books, remains in business. It filed
the appeal acted on today.
   The three Indianapolis bookstores also have gone out of business.
   Later, two bookstores in Howard County, Ind., were prosecuted
under the state law.
   An Indiana appeals court ruled in 1985 that applying the state
RICO law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenity law
violations impermissibly hinders constitutionally protected freedom
of speech.
   The appeals court said the padlocking of the bookstores
represented an impermissible ``prior restraint'' of materials not
yet ruled obscene.
   The Indiana Supreme Court last year reversed the appeals court,
ruling that applying the RICO law in such a way is valid because
the Legislature did not pass it to promote censorship.
   ``The seizure order does not constitute a prior restraint or in
any other manner impinge upon'' Fort Wayne Books' free-speech
rights, the state court said in a 3-2 ruling.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a Florida
man convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978.
   The court is expected to use the case to study death row
inmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal
courts for help and to decide whether Florida juries may be told
their life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trial
judge's approval.
   _ Left intact a $1.13 million jury award to an Idaho boy
paralyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination for
three diseases.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the vaccine
manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to
abandon the production of essential vaccines.
   _ Ruled unanimously that financially troubled farmers may not
avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to use
their labor, experience and expertise in continuing to operate
their farm.
   By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to
``adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law cannot be satisfied by
such a promise.
   _ Refused to free churches from having to comply with state
financial-disclosure laws when waging public referendum campaigns.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from Jackson,
Tenn., to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and
freedom of speech.
   _ Let stand a ruling that the public has no right to attend
hearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal trial
jury while the trial is underway.
   The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess the
validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986
racketeering trial of Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards.
   _ Cleared the way for a jury trial in former Massachusetts Gov.
Edward J. King's $3.6 million libel lawsuit against the Boston
Globe.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact a
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling that a jury should hear
King's contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column.
   _ Cleared the way for a trial in what may become an important
test case on the power of cities to control rents and otherwise
protect mobile home residents.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Santa Barbara,
Calif., officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by owners of a mobile
home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of their
property's full value.
   In seeking help from the nation's highest court in the adult
bookstore case, lawyers for Fort Wayne Books argued that ``neither
interim nor permanent restraints of the type involved in this case
may constitutionally be enforced prior to final judidical
resolution'' unless the law guarantees speedy appellate review.
   The appeal noted that as yet no trial has been held to determine
whether any of the materials seized from Fort Wayne Books were
obscene and therefore not constitutionally protected.
   The justices were told that ``a growing number of states are
adopting similar RICO laws, and there is a conflict among the
states as to their constitutionality.''
   The adult bookstore cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana,
87-470; and Sappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout, mushers moving out of Finger Lake</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting warm temperatures and wet
snow, the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race were out of
Finger Lake and on their way to Rainy Pass early today.
   Thirteen teams left the Finger Lake checkpoint, 193 miles from
the 1,158-mile race's starting line, in one hour late Sunday.
Twenty-three other teams had arrived at the checkpoint.
   Lavon Barve of Wasilla and Jerry Austin of St. Michael pulled
out at 7:39 p.m. They were followed by DeeDee Jonrowe of Bethel,
1987 champion Susan Butcher of Manley, four-time champion Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers and Tim Moerlein of Kasilof.
   Barve and Swenson had declared their 24-hour layovers, then
canceled the layover. All mushers are required to halt for one full
24 hour period during the race to rest themselves and their dogs.
   Temperatures in the Rainy Pass area were in the high 20s early
today, the National Weather Service reported. Temperatures that
hovered around 32 degrees on Saturday took a toll on many of the
sled dogs, which are accustomed to running in much colder weather.
   Herbie Nayokpuk was 18th into Skwentna, a checkpoint 148 miles
from Anchorage, and notified officials he would take the race's
mandatory 24-hour layover in Skwentna.
   ``I've got to save some of my dogs,'' he said. ``I almost burned
them up. I'll have to rest them a little bit.''
   When the lead mushers reach Puntilla Lake in Rainy Pass, they
will have covered 223 miles of the 1,158-mile race.
   Fifty-two teams started the race early Saturday. Defending
champion Butcher finished last year's race in a record 11 days, two
hours.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.
   U.S. mushers from outside Alaska, and their positions: Frank
Teasley of Jackson, Wyo., was 15th; Terry Adkins of Mikado, Mich.,
was 21st; Robin Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., was 27th; Dan
MacEachen of Snowmass Village, Colo., was 29th; John Patten of
Grand Marais, Minn., was 35st; and Stan Ferguson of Philadelphia
was 41th.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of irate retirees rallied in
the streets today as local banks remained shuttered, and Panama's
ousted vice president urged his countrymen to take up arms against
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega if the military leader didn't step down.
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Panama Canal Commission said
ships were passing normally through the waterway despite reports
that the nation's crisis was holding up passage of ships through
the canal.
   About 300 retirees, chanting ``Justice,'' were joined by scores
of younger supporters who cut off traffic on the city's main
Avenida Espana in front of the towering National Bank of Panama
building.
   ``We little old people don't have that much strength, but we'll
hold out here as long as we can,'' said Violeta Sanchez, 63, a
retired secretary.
   At least 200 more retirees gathered in front of the Treasury
Ministry to demonstrate.
   Noriega's regime, under increasing pressure from the United
States, tried to assure the country's 60,000 retirees over the
weekend that they would be able to cash their pension checks for
the first two weeks of March. But it did not say how or where, and
the pensioners were indignant.
   Rafael Arosemena, president of the National Bank, came out of
the building to try to placate the retirees, and was surrounded by
an antagonistic crowd. He told them they should go to another
branch, but they refused to do so.
   Later in the morning, the government radio station said the
National Bank would set up two payment booths in the afternoon to
cash retirement checks.
   Banks fearing a run because of political instability closed last
week.
   The government blames the closures on lack of funds resulting
from the freezing of Panamanian government money deposited in five
U.S. banks.
   Panama's official currency is the U.S. dollar, and the
government periodically receives shipments of tender from the U.S.
banks where it keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit.
   A request for such a shipment last week was rejected because of
legal action taken on behalf of Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was
ousted from the presidency on Feb. 26.
   Panama Canal Commission spokesman Willie Friar said the rumors
that ship traffic through the canal was being disrupted began with
unconfirmed reports that Panamanian port authorities _ which have
been independent from the Canal Commission since 1979 _ were
accepting payment only in cash.
   She said other forms of payment were being accepted for port
services such as bunkering _ taking on fuel or water.
   She also said the great majority of the three dozen vessels that
make the passage on an average day do not use the port facilities.
   She said all 38 vessels scheduled to make the passage Sunday did
so, and that the 39 scheduled to pass through today were proceeding
normally without delay.
   On Sunday, Roderick Esquivel, Panama's ousted vice president,
said from hiding that if Noriega does not relinquish power,
Panamanians should take up arms against him.
   In an interview with The Associated Press from a house where he
was staying, Esquivel warned Sunday:
   ``If peaceful means and the economic measures are not sufficient
to achieve democracy, then I am the first to say that democracy
must be obtained by fighting for it.''
   Esquivel was ousted from office in a military-orchestrated coup
on Feb. 26 along with Delvalle, who also remains in hiding. The two
men were removed from their posts a day after Delvalle tried to
fire Noriega.
   ``Many people think Panama does not have much capacity for
violence, but it does,'' he said.
   The Education Ministry postponed the start of public school
classes until further notice. Teachers were to have returned to
school from vacation today for a week of preparation, with students
beginning classes March 14. The ministry said in a statement the
postponement was due to the climate of crisis.
   Panama's 12 local banks have been shuttered since last Tuesday.
Branches of international institutions closed their doors on Friday.
   The National Bank of Panama said it could not supply its member
banks with tender and instructed them on Friday to remain closed
until further notice.
   People have not been able to cash checks since Feb. 29, and
stores have stopped accepting checks and credit cards.
   ``The entire population is prepared to suffer economic
hardship,'' Esquivel said of mounting economic pressure from
Washington. ``And in a second phase, they are ready to sacrifice
their lives.''

   Potential liability problems
surrounding a tree house that extends two feet over public property
have prompted city officials to give the structure the ax.
   ``It's accessible to the public, and there is the possibility it
could entirely or partially fall on somebody passing by or damage
property,'' said Chief Building Inspector Louis Kidwell.
   The 8-by-6-foot tree house was built by Teresa Macdonald's
father, a contractor, a few months ago as a Christmas present for
her sons, James, 6, and Joey, 4.
   It features wall-to-wall carpeting, a shingled roof and sliding
plexiglass windows and is a popular place for neighborhood children
to play.
   ``If I didn't have school, I'd spend every single day up
there,'' said James Macdonald.
   ``My dad said, `Whatever happened to the days of Huckleberry
Finn and Tom Sawyer?''' said Teresa Macdonald.
   She said she understands the city's concern but added that few
people use the sidewalk on their dead-end street.
   ``I've been up there on the windiest days and nothing has
happened,'' she said. ``We'd have to have an earthquake or a
nuclear war.''
   The Macdonalds have until March 21 to remove the tree house. If
the city doesn't change its mind, they will build a foundation for
it in their back yard and place it there.

   The Supreme Court, in an important victory for
investors, today placed a heavy burden of proof on companies that
are sued for denying they are holding merger negotiations after
such preliminary talks are underway.
   By a 4-2 vote, the court said if companies withhold important
information affecting stock prices, it must be presumed that
investors who bought and sold the securities were relying on that
information.
   ``An investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the
market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price,'' said
Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the court. ``Because most publicly
available information is reflected in market price, an investor's
reliance on any public material misrepresentations, therefore, may
be presumed.''
   The absence of a five-vote majority in the case raises the
possibility the issue could be reconsidered by the justices in
another case with a different result. But, for now at least,
today's decision is likely to have important repercussions on Wall
Street.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last month, did
not take part in considering the case. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia disqualified themselves from
participating without explanation.
   The court ordered further hearings in a dispute involving Basic
Inc. of Cleveland.
   The company merged with CEBAS Inc., a subsidiary of Combustion
Engineering based in Connecticut, in December 1978.
   Stockholders said Basic executives falsely denied for 14 months
prior to the merger that at least preliminary talks were underway
between the two companies.
   As a result, many investors said they sold their stock at far
less than its value.
   Combustion Engineering is a conglomerate that makes alumina or
acid-based refractories _ non-metallic ceramic substances used as
structural materials. Both Basic and Combustion Engineering were
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The stock of Basic was selling at well under $20 a share when
merger rumors began surfacing in late 1977. There was a dramatic
increase in the volume of activity in the stock accompanied by a
sharp run-up in price. The eventual merger price of the stock was
$46 a share.
   Company officials repeatedly said they could not account for the
activity and denied merger negotiations were underway.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1986 that public
statements by Basic management during the period leading up to the
merger were misleading or untrue, even if the company's denials of
negotiations might be correct technically.
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appellate court's reasoning
that the company's denial of the preliminary talks by itself
created grounds for the investors to win their suit.
   Information about a company that is otherwise insignificant does
not become important _ or material to the stock's value _ solely
because the company denied existence of the development, Blackmun
said.
   ``Materiality is something to be determined on the basis of the
particular facts of each case,'' Blackmun said. ``Materiality
depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on
the withheld or misrepresented information.''
   Using that standard, the court ordered further lower court
hearings in the suit by investors in Basic who said they lost money
because facts were withheld from them.
   Blackmun said the presumption at the new hearings must be that
the investors would have relied on those facts, unless the
management of Basic can prove otherwise.
   ``Where materially misleading statements have been disseminated
into an impersonal, well-developed market for securities, the
reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market
price may be presumed,'' Blackmun said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens.
   Justice Byron R. White, in an opinion joined by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, said the ruling ``may have many adverse, unintended
effects as it is applied and interpreted in the years to come.''
   For example, White said many investors in Basic who are now
suing may have doubted the company's denials that preliminary
merger talks were underway.
   ``Such investors, the savviest of the savvy, will be able to
recover under the court's opinion,'' White said.
   The case is Basic Inc. vs. Levinson, 86-279.

   British soldiers and police shot and killed
three unarmed Irish Republican Army members and Foreign Secretary
Sir Geoffrey Howe told the House of Commons today a ``dreadful
terrorist act has been averted.''
   News reports said two men and a woman were killed Sunday after
they planted a car bomb and set it to go off Tuesday during a
military parade in this British colony.
   But Howe denied the news reports and said no bomb had been
planted.
   He said a second car linked to the guerrillas and parked in
Spanish territory near border with Gibraltar, a British colony,
contained three false passports and equipment, including an alarm
clock, insulating tape, gloves and wire.
   ``There is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterday's
events a dreadful terrorist act has been averted,'' said Howe,
speaking to the House of Commons in London.
   ``The three people killed were actively involved in the planning
and attempted excecution of that act.'' He did not elaborate.
   British news reports said the two men and a woman were killed
after authorities uncovered a plot to set off the car bomb. The
reports quoted unidentified security sources.
   The reports said bomb-disposal experts defused 440 pounds of
explosives in a Spanish-registered car parked near Gov. Sir Peter
Terry's official residence in Gibraltar, on the southern tip of
Spain.
   British Armed Forces Minister Ian Stewart said ``an intelligence
tip-off'' led to information about the three members of the Irish
Republican Army, which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the
British out of Northern Ireland.
   Ronald Sindon, a spokesman for the governor, said local police
coordinated the effort.
   ``The operation was under the control of the Gibraltar police
commissioner, and British forces acted in support of Gibraltar
police,'' he said.
   In an interview in London today on the British Broadcasting
Corporation's Radio 4 program, Stewart said the Gibraltar
government of Chief Minister Adolfo Canepa asked Britain for
military assistance ``under the standard arrangements because of
the involvement of suspected terrorists.''
   Stewart said the two men and a woman were unarmed when they were
shot and killed by members of the British Armed Forces.
   Asked whether Gibraltar police participated in the shooting,
Sindon said: ``I am not in a position to comment on operational
procedures.''
   In Madrid, Spanish State Security spokesman Augustin Valladolid
said today Spanish police had tipped off British authorities more
than a month ago about the presence of the suspected IRA members on
Spain's southern Costa del Sol.
   Valladolid said British officials asked Spanish police to keep
the three under surveillance but not to intervene.
   In a statement released Sunday in Belfast, the IRA said the
three were attached to ``active service units'' of its general
headquarters in Belfast. It extended ``deepest sympathy to the
families of the volunteers.''
   Independent Television in Britain today identified the three as
Mairead Farrell, 31; Don McCann, 30; and Sean Savage, 24. The
report said they were driving to the airport when they were stopped
by the police.
   It said Miss Farrell served part of a 14-year prison sentence in
connection with a hotel bombing in Belfast in 1976.
   EFE, Spain's national news agency, said the car carrying the
three IRA members was stopped by police on a road leading to the
Spanish border.
   British newspapers today quoted witnesses as saying plainclothes
police officers jumped out of a vehicle and shot without warning at
the three. They said one man and the woman fell on the spot and the
other man had run 300 yards toward the town center before he was
gunned down.
   The Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted
officials as saying the purported bomb may have been timed to go
off Tuesday when soldiers of the Royal Anglian Regiment are to take
part in the changing of the guard ceremony.
   The regiment has just completed a tour in Northern Ireland.
   The Guardian, a London newspaper, said today police were
carrying out house-to-house searches in the Spanish border town of
La Linea on Sunday night for other members.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland in a
socialist state.

   Republican presidential contenders Bob Dole and Jack Kemp
invoked President Reagan's name today trying to stem a George Bush
tide on Super Tuesday, as the Democrats focused on Texas the day
beore the most delegate-rich showdown in political history.
   In Washington, a federal judge dismissed GOP candidate Pat
Robertson's $35 million libel suit against a former congressman who
questioned his Korean war record.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the leader in polls of
Texas and Florida Democrats, met with senior citizens at a North
Miami Beach condominium development.
   On Sunday he campaigned in Spanish as he appealed to Hispanic
voters in Texas and then flew to Georgia where he met with former
President Carter.
   Robertson was in Texas and told an audience in Abilene, ``The
frontier that beckons us today is the energy frontier.''
   The former television evangelist got the endorsement of Diane
Denman, vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party, who said she
knows all the candidates ``but without a doubt, I've got more
confidence that it is Pat Robertson who will provide the unswerving
commitment to the conservative beliefs that are needed to see
America into the 1990s.''
   Dole told a news conference in Atlanta that ``polls do
demonstrate that I beat all the Democrats. He (Bush) doesn't beat
any of them. ... We're trying to continue to Reaganize the
Republican Party, to let it grow.''
   Kemp, struggling to survive after finishing no better than third
in any contest so far, told an audience at Louisiana State
University, ``I think the Republican Party wants a Reagan
Republican progressive conservative to be nominated and frankly,
George Bush, Bob Dole and Pat Robertson don't qualify.''
   ``We are in the race,'' insisted Kemp, brushing aside questions
of how well he had to do on Tuesday to survive.
   While Dukakis met with Carter, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
picked up backing from another influential Georgian, Sen. Sam Nunn.
As the Georgia senator left for a week-long trip to the Soviet
Union, his office released a statement saying he had cast his
absentee ballot for Gore because ``his views come closest to my own
views as to the steps our nation must take to meet our challenges
at home and abroad.''
   Four of Dukakis' rivals _ Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart, Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Gore _ were in Texas today, as was
Robertson. Bush was ending his campaign day in his hometown of
Houston.
   Texas, which votes with 19 other states on Tuesday, offers a
trove of 183 Democratic delegates and 111 on the Republican side.
   In Washington, U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green signed a
brief order dismissing Robertson's libel suit ``with prejudice,''
which means that former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif. is
legally the victor in the dispute.
   Robertson accepted the condition the judge imposed on Friday in
a one-sentence letter from his attorney Douglas V. Rigler that was
delivered to the judge's chambers by messenger.
   Under terms of the dismissal, Robertson must pay court fees,
printing costs and court reporters' fees, but not McCloskey's
attorney's fees, which he has said total about $400,000.
   ``This is a confirmation of my integrity,'' McCloskey said today
in a telephone interview from his home in San Francisco. ``I don't
like at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over the
United States. He is admitting that he is the one who is the liar.''
   Dole conceded Sunday he was involved in ``a long, hard fight''
for the GOP nomination and he had little cause for optimism about
his prospects on Tuesday when 17 states hold Republican primaries
and 20 hold Democratic contests.
   There are 712 Republican and 1,307 Democratic delegates at
stake, including the four to be selected from American Samoa.
   Southern and border states dominate the day and William Brock,
Dole's campaign manager, said Bush held a ``2-1 or a 3-1 lead in
virtually every Southern state.''
   The vice president demonstrated his strength in the region on
Saturday when he overwhelmed his rivals in the South Carolina
primary and swept the state's 37 delegates.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis looked strongest with leads in
surveys in Texas and Florida, the two biggest Super Tuesday states,
and a lock on his home state of Massachusetts, which also votes on
Tuesday.
   ``It could be he'll come out of Super Tuesday the
front-runner,'' said a Gephardt aide of Dukakis.
   But Carter, during his meeting Sunday evening with Dukakis,
predicted no clear winner on Tuesday.
   Jackson's support in the black community gives him the biggest
Southern base of any candidate. Interviewed Sunday on the ABC
program, ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' he said, ``I'm running
strong in the South,'' but he refused to predict how many delegates
he might win in the region.
   Gore appeared on the same program and conceded he needs to win
more than his home state of Tennessee on Tuesday. He predicted he
would carry ``several other'' states, but refused to say which ones.
   Robertson was interviewed on the NBC show ``Meet the Press'' and
said that if he doesn't get 200 to 300 delegates on Tuesday ``it
will be difficult.''
   The vast Super Tuesday landscape was too much for any candidate
to cover in person. Millions of dollars was being spent to reach
voters through television and radio commercials, with many of the
candidates trying to sell themselves by attacking their rivals.
   Gephardt commercials accused Dukakis of dirty tricks against
other Democratic contenders, while the Massachusetts governor was
running an ad showing an acrobat doing flips, a pointed reference
to Gephardt shifts on issues.
   Dole continued to run commercials attacking Bush for his role in
the Iran-Contra affair, while the vice president was portraying the
Kansas senator as straddling on taxes.

   Two noted sex experts who criticized health
authorities for failing to stress the extent of the AIDS epidemic
said today that their own estimates of the spread of AIDS were
based on beliefs and estimates, not scientific evidence.
   ``We did not project our own database on to the general
population,'' said Robert Kolodny, co-author with William Masters
and Virginia Johnson of ``Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior in the Age
of AIDS.''
   Kolodny said at a press conference this morning that the
authors' assertion that AIDS is ``now running rampant in the
heterosexual community'' was an estimate based on analysis of
existing studies that have appeared in scientific journals. It was
not based on original research by the authors, he said.
   Masters, asked for his justification of the claim, said, ``I
simply believe it.''
   The authors criticized health authorities for failing to stress
the threat of AIDS to heterosexuals, and they have themselves been
criticized by an AIDS expert for making recommendations that might
alarm the public.
   But in their book Masters, Johnson and Kolodny say that medical
experts have played down their findings rather than present
worst-case scenarios ``in the understandable wish to avoid mass
panic.''
   The book calls for widespread mandatory testing for acquired
immune deficiency syndrome infection by pregnant women, couples
seeking marriage licenses and hospital patients between ages 15 and
60.
   Excerpts from the book are appearing in this week's issue of
Newsweek magazine. The authors run the Masters and Johnson
Institute in St. Louis and wrote a best-seller, ``Human Sexual
Response.''
   But some AIDS experts questioned their conclusions on the spread
of the deadly disease.
   ``Masters and Johnson may have expertise in sexuality but they
have no credentials to justify their recommendations concerning
AIDS public health policy _ recommendations that will surely alarm
the public,'' said Mathilde Krim, founding chairwoman of the
American Foundation for AIDS Research.
   ``From everything we know today, such mandatory testing schemes
will not help protect the public,'' she said Saturday.
   Masters and Johnson's book suggests that to guard against
infection, potential sexual partners undergo tests and remain
monogamous.
   Dr. Beny J. Primm, a member of President Reagan's AIDS
commission, said he agreed that recent optimistic reports about
heterosexuals could ``lull people into a state of complacency.''
   He said as a result many ``don't use condoms, still are
promiscuous and still participate in group sex or other dangerous
activities.''
   The book disputed estimates that there are now about 1.5 million
people infected with the virus in the United States.
   ``It is quite likely that there are now 3 million or more
carriers of the AIDS virus in the United States, most of whom are
otherwise healthy and unaware of their infected, contagious
state,'' it said.
   ``Experts generally are gravely underestimating the degree to
which the AIDS virus has spread into the heterosexual community,''
it said.
   The authors said they based their findings on their own study of
800 sexually active heterosexual adults between the ages of 21 and
40 who met three criteria: no blood transfusions received since
1977; no use of illicit drugs by injection; no homosexual or
bisexual contact since 1977.
   The study, however, did not appear to follow the usual
scientific process and the authors conceded that their sample was
not obtained by random sampling methods and did not closely match
the general U.S. population.
   They said they found that among a subgroup of subjects who
average more than 12 partners annually and generally failed to take
precautions, 14 percent of the women had been infected with the
AIDS virus and 12 percent of the men.
   The findings were an indication, the researchers said, that
''public health authorities have failed to impress the general
public with the message that AIDS has broken out.''

<HEAD>Court Gives Investors Important Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in an important victory for
investors, today placed a heavy burden of proof on companies that
are sued for denying they are holding merger negotiations after
such preliminary talks are underway.
   By a 4-2 vote, the court said if companies withhold important
information affecting stock prices, it must be presumed that
investors who bought and sold the securities were relying on that
information.
   ``An investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the
market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price,'' said
Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the court. ``Because most publicly
available information is reflected in market price, an investor's
reliance on any public material misrepresentations, therefore, may
be presumed.''
   The absence of a five-vote majority in the case raises the
possibility the issue could be reconsidered by the justices in
another case with a different result. But, for now at least,
today's decision is likely to have important repercussions on Wall
Street.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last month, did
not take part in considering the case. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia disqualified themselves from
participating without explanation.
   The court ordered further hearings in a dispute involving Basic
Inc. of Cleveland.
   The company merged with CEBAS Inc., a subsidiary of Combustion
Engineering based in Connecticut, in December 1978.
   Stockholders said Basic executives falsely denied for 14 months
prior to the merger that at least preliminary talks were underway
between the two companies.
   As a result, many investors said they sold their stock at far
less than its value.
   Combustion Engineering is a conglomerate that makes alumina or
acid-based refractories _ non-metallic ceramic substances used as
structural materials. Both Basic and Combustion Engineering were
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The stock of Basic was selling at well under $20 a share when
merger rumors began surfacing in late 1977. There was a dramatic
increase in the volume of activity in the stock accompanied by a
sharp run-up in price. The eventual merger price of the stock was
$46 a share.
   Company officials repeatedly said they could not account for the
activity and denied merger negotiations were underway.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1986 that public
statements by Basic management during the period leading up to the
merger were misleading or untrue, even if the company's denials of
negotiations might be correct technically.
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appellate court's reasoning
that the company's denial of the preliminary talks by itself
created grounds for the investors to win their suit.
   Information about a company that is otherwise insignificant does
not become important _ or material to the stock's value _ solely
because the company denied existence of the development, Blackmun
said.
   ``Materiality is something to be determined on the basis of the
particular facts of each case,'' Blackmun said. ``Materiality
depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on
the withheld or misrepresented information.''
   Using that standard, the court ordered further lower court
hearings in the suit by investors in Basic who said they lost money
because facts were withheld from them.
   Blackmun said the presumption at the new hearings must be that
the investors would have relied on those facts, unless the
management of Basic can prove otherwise.
   ``Where materially misleading statements have been disseminated
into an impersonal, well-developed market for securities, the
reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market
price may be presumed,'' Blackmun said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens.
   Justice Byron R. White, in an opinion joined by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, said the ruling ``may have many adverse, unintended
effects as it is applied and interpreted in the years to come.''
   For example, White said many investors in Basic who are now
suing may have doubted the company's denials that preliminary
merger talks were underway.
   ``Such investors, the savviest of the savvy, will be able to
recover under the court's opinion,'' White said.
   The case is Basic Inc. vs. Levinson, 86-279.

<HEAD>Eccentric: A Perfectly Sane Way To Be, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who hunt vampires, live in caves or slide
down buildings in pink elephant costumes aren't crazy. They're just
eccentric, and more creative than everybody else, says a researcher
who spent three years studying them.
   Dr. David Weeks, principal clinical psychologist at the Royal
Edinburgh Hospital in Scotland, interviewed 130 eccentrics and said
he found only one insane person in the crowd.
   He has turned his findings into a book called ``Eccentrics: The
Scientific Investigation,'' to be published in May by Stirling
University Press.
   ``It was the first scientific study of its kind in the world,''
Weeks said in a telephone interview Monday. His study exploded a
few myths _ among them that Britons are more eccentric than
Americans.
   ``Britain has more of a reputation'' for eccentricity, said
Weeks, an American from Garwood, N.J., who has lived in Britain
since 1975.
   But both the United States and Britain seem to have more
eccentrics than other countries, possibly because they have the
strongest traditions of free speech, according to Weeks.
   It's also a myth that British eccentrics are mainly aristocrats.
   ``They're mostly in the upper middle class _ professional
people,'' the psychologist said, and they tend to be outspoken
loners.
   Weeks cites Prince Charles as an eccentric, given his interest
in unconventional medicine, his habit of talking to plants, his
solitary trips to meditate and his peevish outbursts against modern
architecture.
   ``He'd probably be a lot more eccentric if he weren't royalty,''
the psychologist said. ``That probably restricts him.''
   Weeks reckons one person in 10,000 is an eccentric. They tend to
be highly creative and have vivid imaginations and graphic dreams.
   ``They have lots of good ideas,'' Weeks said. ``However, they
can be inflexible. If they get a good idea, they stick with it.''
   The eccentrics Weeks met included a man who has lived in a cave
for eight years.
   Another eccentric scales office buildings in a pink elephant
costume and has built a ``helimobile,'' a contraption with wheels,
wings, flashing lights and an engine.
   ``It moves, but it doesn't fly,'' Weeks said.
   Then there was a teacher from Long Island, N.Y., who set up a
vampire investigation bureau, which is open at night. The teacher
travels the world hunting the bloodthirsty creatures.
   And a Scottish lady offered herself as a virgin sacrifice in a
mock ritual atop a extinct volcano in the middle of Edinburgh.
   Only one turned out to be insane, Weeks said. He thought he was
a secret agent and demonstrated a throat-cutting technique on Week'
research assistant, Kate Ward, with a set of keys.
   Weeks and Ms. Ward found eccentrics by word of mouth and
publicity about their work. People who thought they qualified as
eccentrics were given mental and personality tests.
   Eccentrics tend to be happier than most people because they
don't take themselves too seriously, Weeks said. ``They just have
this good sense of humor,'' he said.

   Hundreds of students today shut down Gallaudet
University, the nation's only university for the deaf, out of anger
over the selection of a president who is not hearing impaired.
   The school was closed early this morning after an estimated 600
students blocked campus entrances, said Thomasina Wilson, a
spokeswoman for the school's security force.
   Joining the students, who were supported by faculty members and
alumni, was at least one high-ranking administrator, Dean of
Student Life Frank R. Turk, who told a reporter, ``I have never
felt so defeated.''
   At issue is the selection of Elisabeth A. Zinser, now vice
chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
Gallaudet, chartered by Congress in 1864 as the only liberal arts
college for the deaf, has never had a deaf president.
   Wilson said students blocked campus entrances with their cars
about 6 a.m. James Barnes, the school's vice president for
business, closed the university a short time later.
   ``It's totally impossible for employees to get in,'' Wilson said.
   The board said it would meet with the protesting students, but
only if they allowed traffic on and off the campus. The students
refused.
   Besides a deaf president, the students were demanding the
resignation of board chairman Jane Bassett Spilman and a change in
the make-up of the 20-member board to increase the number of deaf
members from four to more than half.
   A city police officer, Capt. M.J. Johnson, said he expected no
arrests as long as the demonstration remained peaceful.
   Turk, walking with students outside the school, said the board
was the problem.
   ``I've been on the Gallaudet payroll for 35 years,'' said Turk,
who is deaf. ``I have never felt so defeated. I do not think I will
ever experience a more frustrating feeling in my life. Obviously,
we need to overhaul our board of trustees completely. ... They must
go _ now.''
   After Zinser's selection was announced late Sunday night,
students marched 60 blocks from the campus in northeast Washington
to the downtown hotel where the university's board was meeting, and
back again.
   On the way back, the marchers passed the White House, then sat
at the foot of the Capitol grounds, where they were faced for half
an hour by a line of 25 city police officers.
   Earlier Sunday, throngs of students, faculty and alumni had
gathered at the school's gates and waved signs urging ``Deaf
President Now.''
   ``It's important for us,'' student Sherri Lambert said. ``A deaf
president is a role model of all deaf people. He is a leader of the
whole deaf community.''
   Students, faculty and alumni had been urging the appointment of
one of the deaf candidates for several weeks. In picking Zinser,
the school's trustes bypassed two deaf candidates.
   The deaf candidates for the job were Harvey J. Corson, 44,
superintendent of the Louisiana School for the Deaf in Baton Rouge
and a Gallaudet board member; and I. King Jordan, 45, dean of
Gallaudet's College of Arts and Sciences. Both are Gallaudet
graduates.
   The cause of a deaf president has had strong support in
Congress. Republican presidential candidates Robert Dole and George
Bush have urged the board to name the school's first deaf president.
   ``In 124 years we didn't give them a chance,'' residence hall
supervisor Tina Jo Breindel wrote on note paper. ``Like eating
Italian food in Chinese restaurant _ strange.''
   Zinser, who has been vice chancellor at Greensboro since 1983,
said she plans to take the new job despite the protests. ``Very
soon I hope to have the opportunity to be a real person to them,''
she said.
   Zinser said the most important step for her now is to develop
skills to communicate with the deaf community. She does not know
sign language, but is taking classes in it.
   Spilman said Zinser had been chosen ``because neither of the
other two candidates had the breadth of her experience.''
   The vote was 10-4 for Zinser. Of the four deaf board members,
three voted against Zinser; one could not vote because he was a
candidate for the job.
   ``We are aware that it is inevitable that there will be a period
where intense disappointment will take over,'' Spilman said. ``We
know that it will not be easily or quickly erased. We are convinced
that, given a chance, both students and the deaf community at large
will respond.''
   Zinser received her doctorate in educational psychology from the
University of California, Berkeley in 1972. She also has a
bachelor's degree in nursing from Stanford University and a
master's degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   The previous president, Jerry C. Lee, left in January to become
a vice president of Bassett Furniture Co., run by the board
chairman's family.
   Gallaudet has an enrollment of 2,200 university students, 400
high school students and 200 elementary school students. Nearly all
the undergraduates are deaf.
   School spokesman Kelly Voyet said life at Gallaudet is similar
to that at other colleges except for the ways in which people
communicate.
   Students are ``taught in the total communication method, which
is signed English and voice,'' said Voyet, ``so that no matter what
method the student uses to communicate, it's available to him. A
lot of students in their schools learned how to lip read as well as
sign.''
   The students use TTY machines, which have typewriters with
screens, to talk on the telephone; strobe lilghts replace fire
alarms.
   ``Otherwise, its basically the same'' as other universities,''
Voyet said. ``You just don't hear a lot of voices. Other than
signing, there's nothing different. They live in dorms, play
sports, have homecoming. It's a university with the normal
university things. The communication method is a little different
in some respect, but that's it.''

   Election campaigning is causing some beer
lovers in Kenya to run short of their favorite brew as politicians
try to woo voters with free rounds, an official of Kenya Breweries
Limited said Monday.
   The result, according to bar and restaurant owners across the
country, is that they aren't getting enough beer to satisfy
customer demand.
   Many politicians vying for Parliamentary seats and civic posts
in the March 21 election have been buying beer for would-be
supporters.
   Peter Burugu, transport and sales director for the
privately-owned Kenya Breweries, said the company Saturday released
500,000 crates of beer for distribution throughout the country.
Each crate holds 24 bottles.
   ``Normally this is enough but it proved inadequate during this
period of the year and the 1988 political campaigns,'' he said.

   Two blacks described by police
as ``trained terrorists'' were killed, and six policemen were
slightly injured in a shootout at a house in Queenstown, police
said Monday.
   Police, acting on a tip, surrounded a house in the southern city
on Friday afternoon and ordered the inhabitants to leave. When the
occupants refused, police threw ``stun grenades'' into the house,
police said in a statement.
   A stun grenade contains no shrapnel and is considered non-lethal.
   A shootout ensued, and two black men inside the house were
killed. The six officers suffered minor injuries, the statement
said.
   Police did not say how they knew the men were ``trained
terrorists.''
   Also Monday, police said they expelled seven police reservists
because they were members of the extreme right-wing Afrikaner
Resistance Movement.
   The paramilitary group seeks a whites-only homeland within South
Africa and has been taking an increasingly confrontational stance
recently against the white-led government.
   Several thousand members marched on government buildings on Feb.
27 to present a petition calling for an all-white state.
   The government said last week it would dismiss policemen holding
membership in the organization. The seven reservists, from northern
Transvaal province, were the first policemen expelled under the
government's new policy.

   A two-headed shrimp a fisherman found in
his bait bucket appears to be the first such specimen on record,
experts say.
   ``We're dealing with a first occurrence here, I guess, to the
best of our knowledge,'' said Neal Baxter, chief of the National
Marine Fisheries Service ecology division in Galveston.
   The shrimp has been sent to the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington.
   Howard Fraley, 37 and his wife, C.J., were fishing near
Galveston last May when Fraley dipped into his bait bucket and came
out with the oddity.
   ``I said: `Why, this thing's got two heads!''' he said.
   The couple photographed the shrimp, then took it home and put it
in their freezer.
   Mrs. Fraley mentioned it to Baxter, who told Austin B. Williams,
a curator of invertebrates at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History.
   ``It was as curious to me as it was to the folks who found it,''
Williams said.
   Williams dissected the shrimp and said both heads appeared
normal in many ways. He has searched scientific literature to the
late 1800s, but has found no mention of a similar case.
   Fraley feels lucky to have found the creature.
   ``I was excited,'' he said. ``And to think I nearly tore the
head off.''

<HEAD>Rackets Run Rampant In Mobster-Riddled Republic, Pravda Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corruption is so rampant in the Soviet republic of
Turkmenia that a powerful underworld has developed, complete with
hit men, protection rackets, police payoffs and powerful mob
chieftains, Pravda said Monday.
   The Communist Party newspaper even noted that the funeral of an
underworld crime boss drew 400 mourners.
   Pravda said many police officers not only looked the other way
at crime in the Central Asian republic, but masterminded some of
the schemes. It said 12 are now are on trial for extortion.
   ``They extorted money mostly from those who wouldn't appeal to
the police, like a certain Gavrush Sarkisya, a former shop foreman,
who confessed to the police later that he owed the criminals
($150,000),'' Pravda said. ``And they threatened him with a firing
squad should he fail to pay up.''
   Other Central Asian republics also have been blasted by the
Soviet media for large-scale corruption. In recent months, the
media have exposed millions of dollars in graft in Uzbekistan,
Turkmenia's neighbor to the north.
   On Jan. 20, the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta disclosed that the
head of an agricultural complex in Uzbekistan built his own mob
empire, complete with his own courts and an underground prison
constructed by 1,000 workers.
   The expose was striking in its recitation of abuses.
   Pravda's account on Turkmenia, while not as dramatic, was the
strongest criticism yet of the Soviet Union's southernmost
republic, which has 3.27 million people, mostly Moslems.
   Official media criticism of Turkmenia usually has centered
around Moslem customs judged by the central government to be
abhorent, such as reports of young women being killed for
insufficient marriage dowries.
   ``The republic suffers a difficult situation, created over years
of bureaucratic rule,'' Pravda said. Referring to the swelling
bureacracy, it added: ``Every sixth person in the republic is a
hack official.
   ``Many highly placed police officials, and policemen of lesser
ranks, were involved in all kinds of crimes and often acted as
their skilled masterminds,'' the newspaper reported.
   Pravda said the crackdown in the region began with the recent
appointment of Alexander F. Udalov as the republic's police chief.
Pravda said he was threatened shortly after taking office by Ilyas
A. Sarkiev, one of those now on trial.
   ``Just leave me alone. Quit this case. Several hundred thousand
rubles will go your way,'' Sarkiev was quoted as telling Udalov.
``Also keep in mind. I know the city your daughter lives in. I have
nothing to lose, you know. You won't be able to get all my people.''
   The newspaper said that Sarkiev was arrested three days after
making the threat.
   Pravda also described a threat against A. Allaverdov, the
manager of a footwear shop in Ashkabad. He reported that when he
had a falling out with Sarkiev, violence began.
   Allaverdov told authorities his new car was stolen and found
burned the next morning in the center of the city. The windows of
his apartment were shot out, he said, and he received a threat that
his son would be kidnapped.
   Pravda said the recent crackdown has routed several
``criminals'' from official posts in Turkmenia, but it noted that a
recent funeral illustrated continuing problems.
   ``A well-known underworld figure died in a traffic accident.
Four hundred criminals came to his funeral from different cities,
which goes to show the atmosphere in Ashkhabad quite well,'' Pravda
said.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Farmer Bankruptcy Issue in Minnesota Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that
financially troubled farmers may not avoid foreclosure under
federal bankruptcy law by promising to use their labor, experience
and expertise in continuing to operate their farm.
   By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to
``adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law cannot be satisified
by such a promise.
   The ruling is a key setback for many farmers who suffered
financial difficulty in the early 1980s. One such couple was James
and Mary Ahlers, grain and livestock farmers who farm about 840
acres of land in Nobles County, Minn.
   The Ahlers have outstanding loans with two Minnesota banks,
Norwest Bank Worthington and the Federal Land Bank of St. Paul.
   Today's decision, overturning a ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, is a victory for the two banks.
   Between 1965 and 1982 the Ahlers obtained four loans from the
Federal Land Bank of St. Paul, securing each of the loans with a
separate parcel of land they owned.
   Between 1982 and 1984 they obtained additional loans from
Norwest Bank Worthington, securing them with a second mortgage on
the land used to secure the Federal Land Bank loans and a first
mortgage on their farm's machinery, equipment, crops and livestock.
   The Ahlers defaulted on the loans _ over $500,000 to the Federal
Land Bank and about $450,000 to Norwest. Just after Norwest went to
court in an attempt to take control of the Ahlers' assets, the
couple filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law.
   That move automatically froze Norwest's collection efforts in a
state court.
   The two banks, claiming they were undersecured creditors, sought
the bankruptcy judge's help in seizing control of the Ahlers'
assets. The banks said the Ahlers could not protect their secured
interest in the outstanding loans.
   The bankruptcy judge and a federal trial judge cleared the way
for foreclosure on the Ahlers' farm but the 8th Circuit court
reversed those rulings in 1986.
   The appeals court ruled that the banks' right to adequate
protection could be satisified by the Ahlers' promise to continue
to work their farm with the experience and expertise they bring to
the job.
   The banks then successfully sought Supreme Court review, joined
by the Reagan administration in urging a reversal of the appeals
court ruling.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Byron R. White said the
appeals court ruling wrongly carved out an exception to the
``absolute priority rule'' of bankruptcy law.
   That rule bars people who file for bankruptcy from getting
anything out of a reorganization plan unless all creditors are paid
off in full.
   ``We find no support in the (bankruptcy) code or our previous
decisions for the court of appeals' application of the absolute
rule in this case,'' White said. ``We conclude that the rule
applies here, and (the Ahlers') promise of future labor warrants no
exception to its operation.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the decision.
   The case is Norwest Bank Worthington vs. Ahler, 86-958.

<HEAD>Man Confesses To Sister's Murder _ Two Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guilt drove a man to turn himself in and confess
after more than two years on the run since he bludgeoned and
strangled his sister in a dispute over money, police say.
   ``I think the police are looking for me,'' officials quoted
Henry Zalewski as saying when he walked into a police station
Saturday evening.
   Zalewski, 54, was charged Sunday with second-degree murder in
the killing of his sister, Genevieve Zalewski, 62, in the apartment
they shared on Sept. 30, 1985.
   ``He did it in a fit of anger ... and because of a financial
situation he was in,'' said Detective Joseph Stabile.
   Zalewski also was charged with attempted murder for the beating
of a neighbor, Alice Turel, now 50, on the same day.
   Detectives said that during his confession Zalewski said he
turned himself in because the guilt was driving him toward suicide.
   Stabile said that at the time of the slaying Zalewski was
penniless and in debt to a loanshark for $8,400.
   On the morning of the slaying, Zalewski made his sister
breakfast. While she was in the kitchen, he struck her on the head
with a piece of pipe, dragged her into a bedroom and strangled her
with rope, Stabile said.
   While fleeing he encountered Turel and beat her over the head
with a pair of pliers before kicking her down a flight of stairs,
Stabile said. Turel needed 67 stitches in the head.
   He disappeared after the attack but police watched the apartment
for three months because a hit list of neighbors was discovered
inside, Officer Hugh Barry said.
   Zalewski said he took $40 from the house and began wandering up
and down the East Coast. He got a Social Security number under a
phony name and alternated between getting welfare and temporary
work.
   Stabile said Zalewski started drinking a quart of vodka a day to
try to dull the memory of killing his sister.
   Three weeks ago, he phoned St. Stanislaus Church to find out
where his sister was buried.

<HEAD>Mayor May Skip Hometown Parade And Spend St. Patrick's Day In
Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn says he may skip Boston's
St. Patrick's Day parade because he and his wife have been invited
to Dublin by Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey.
   Missing the parade in South Boston would mean Flynn would not
face jeers similar to those he faced at a recent hearing on his
plan to desegregate housing projects in that neighborhood.
   Flynn was invited to Dublin to help celebrate that city's
millenium.
   Police said Flynn's integration proposal has made him a target
of increasing death threats.
   ``We've gotten threats periodically since he came into office,
but they've increased over the past few weeks,'' said Sgt.
Detective Edward Wallace. ``We're treating it as a serious matter.''
   Flynn's wife, Cathy, said she was preparing to go to church
Sunday when police told her someone had threatened to bomb the
house. Wallace said a search failed to turn up any explosive device.
   ``I took a position that I believe in and I'm going to see that
it's implemented,'' the mayor said Saturday about his housing plan.
``I can't just worry about the political consequences of everything
I do. People in Southie have more respect for somebody who takes a
position rather than someone who ducks and hides behind someone
else.''
   City Councilor James Kelly, of South Boston, said he believed
Flynn was skipping the parade to avoid potential embarrassment.
   ``I think the mayor feels he would not be that well-received,''
said Kelly, a vocal Flynn critic. ``Obviously that would not be
good for his image. After all, this is his neighborhood.''

<HEAD>U.S. Gains East German, Polish Aid in Closing Abu Nidal Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are monitoring Polish and East
German cooperation with efforts to close down an arms trading
office affiliated with the Abu Nidal terrorist group.
   According to a CIA report, Abu Nidal kept an apartment in Warsaw
and his associates ran a trade operation from an office tower there
after he was forced to leave Iraq in 1983.
   Last summer, U.S. diplomats began pressuring the Polish
government privately, and in August the Poles promised to close the
operation, S.A.S.-International Commerce and Investments, and order
its staff to leave the country. A similar operation was closed in
East Germany.
   ``The front offices have been shut down in Poland and East
Germany,'' a State Department official said. ``They have told us
and we believe that they have been shut down.''
   ``This doesn't necessarily mean that these governments have
ended all their contacts with Abu Nidal's associates for good. We'd
like to think so. It is something that remains to be seen,'' said
the source, who like others interviewed over the past week spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Polish officials insisted that the government ``had no idea''
what S.A.S. was.
   But U.S. officials say Polish security agencies must have known
that Abu Nidal had overall control over S.A.S., and that the
organization was selling Soviet-bloc arms in the Middle East.
   ``There are factions in these governments, and top political
leaders and places like the foreign ministries might not have known
what was going on,'' one U.S. government terrorism expert said.
   Abu Nidal, nom de guerre of Palestinian-born Sabri al-Banna, is
now believed to live in Tunis, according to Soviet-bloc and
administration sources.
   Abu Nidal's group is blamed for numerous terrorist incidents,
including attacks in the Rome and Vienna airports on Dec. 27, 1985,
in which 18 people were killed.
   The head of S.A.S., Samir Hasan Najmeddin, was forced to leave
Poland on Jan. 14, several days after the departure of his top
deputy, according to Polish officials.
   The Poles delayed the expulsions for nearly a month past a
promised December deadline, upsetting some U.S. counterterrorism
officials who pushed for release of an unclassified version of the
CIA report.
   U.S. diplomats dealing with Europe, meanwhile, sought to keep
the affair under wraps, administration sources said.
   Some details of the report were published in The New York Times,
however, angering Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, who complained
about the leak during a January meeting in Warsaw with Deputy
Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, the No. 2 official in the
department, sources said. Whitehead expressed ``regret'' about the
disclosure, the sources said.
   The CIA report, which was discussed by administration officials
but not shown to the AP, said Najmeddin settled in Warsaw in 1973
at No. 3 Bagno St., Apt. 24, and founded S.A.S. 10 years later to
sell arms and other goods abroad, mainly in the Middle East. S.A.S.
maintained offices on the 25th floor of the Intraco Building in
Warsaw.
   Poland earned badly needed foreign currency from the enterprise,
and Abu Nidal's group kept most of the profit as well as weapons.
   S.A.S. was the most important link in a chain of legitimate
business enterprises affiliated with Abu Nidal in Europe, the U.S.
report said.
   The East Germans allowed an Abu Nidal affiliate called Zibado
Consultant and International Commerce to keep an office on
Friedrichstrasse in East Berlin in 1983-86, but now have closed it,
and Bulgarian officials also have curtailed their ties with
terrorist organizations, according to a senior administration
source.
   Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban announced the closure of
the S.A.S. office in January and said authorities did not know
whether Abu Nidal had ever been in Poland.
   ``I am saying this cautiously, because the authorities cannot
exclude'' that Abu Nidal entered the country under another name,
Urban told reporters.
   According to the CIA, Abu Nidal presided over at least four
meetings in Warsaw, two in December 1983, again in September 1984
and most recently in June 1987.
   In Poland, S.A.S. dealt with the Etat Cenzin Co. and paid its
representative, Andrzej Marchewska, $600 a month to facilitate
visas for Palestinian operatives and obtain customs clearances for
shipments of pistols, rifles and hand-held anti-tank and
anti-aircraft weapons.
   The CIA report said many of these weapons went to terrorists
linked to Abu Nidal.
   In the summer of 1984, the report said, S.A.S sold Libya 4,000
Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifles made in East Germany for
about $500,000.
   The next year, S.A.S. was agent for the sale of rifles and
pistols in the Middle East.
   In 1986, the report said, the company obtained 115 British
Enfield anti-riot weapons, keeping 15 and giving 100 to East German
authorities.
   Additionally, the report said, S.A.S. sponsored scholarships for
Palestinians to study in Poland, and some of them were recruited
into Abu Nidal's terrorist organization.

   The death of a 12-year-old boy whose nude
body was found in his family's portable dishwasher has been ruled
accidental, authorities said Monday.
   Brown County Coroner Genie Williams has not officially ruled on
a cause of death, but Cmdr. David Zasada said initial indications
are that Michael Conard ``very probably died of a lack of oxygen
prior to the hot water'' beginning to circulate in the machine a
week ago.
   The boy, who was 4-foot-10 and weighed about 90 pounds,
apparently used the soap dispenser inside the door to pull the door
shut, Zasada said. There is no release mechanism inside the
machine, he said.
   The boy took off his clothes and watch before climbing in
machine, apparently to see how it worked, Zasada said.
   Suicide was ruled out because there was no note and friends,
family and teachers indicated the boy was well-adjusted and happy,
Zasada said.

   The first California condor egg produced by a
captive breeding pair is fertile, and a chick should emerge from
the shell in less than two months, San Diego Wild Animal Park
officials said today.
   Fertility of the egg, laid last Thursday, was confirmed this
morning when condor keepers briefly held it up to a high intensity
lamp and detected a preliminary stage of development, park
spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   The egg was returned to an incubator, where it will be kept
until the expected hatching between April 28 and May 3.
   All of the 27 living California condors are in captivity, 14 at
the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo. Of the 27, 13
were hatched in captivity as part of an effort to build a breeding
flock to save the rare birds from extinction.
   Meanwhile, the parents of the condor egg were said to be doing
well. Keepers removed the egg from its nest at the park's
``condorminium'' to stimulate more breeding activity by the pair,
and that's what's happening.
   ``That's real positive,'' Hanscom said. ``That would lead us to
hope for the production of a second egg, which could come as early
as 30 days after the first egg.''
   ``The parents are doing fine, the egg is doing fine, the keepers
are doing fine,'' Hanscom added.

champion of American entrepreneurial spirit, public causes and
family values. Electronic Data Systems Corp., which he founded in
1962 with $1,000 of his own money, grew into a multibillion-dollar
company and was acquired by General Motors Corp. in 1984.
   The AP meeting is held on the first day of the American

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian convicted of trying to plant a bomb
on an Israeli airliner lost his bid to appeal his 45-year sentence
Monday after a judge declared the prison term was ``not a day too
long.''
   Nezar Hindawi was jailed in October 1986 for duping his pregnant
fiancee into carrying a bomb aboard an El Al jumbo jet at London's
Heathrow Airport the previous April. Israeli guards found the bomb
before it reached the plane.
   Allegations that the Jordan-born Palestinian was in league with
the Syrian Embassy in London led Britain to sever diplomatic ties
with Damascus. Hindawi claimed the Israelis framed him.
   Hindawi's sentence was ``not a day too long'' for ``as foul and
as horrible a crime as can possibly be imagined,'' ruled Lord Chief
Justice Geoffrey Lane, presiding over the three-judge Appeals Court.
   Hindawi's attorney, Michael Massih, argued that Hindawi's
actions had not caused loss of life. But Lane said, ``It is no
thanks to him that he did not succeed in destroying 36O to 37O
lives in an effort to promote one side of a political dispute by
terrorism.''
   Pleading for Hindawi to be permitted to appeal his sentence,
Massih argued that it was harsh compared with the 35-year sentence
imposed on Patrick Magee, convicted of planting an Irish Republican
Army bomb in a hotel where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was
staying. That bomb killed five people.
   Lane pointed out that unlike Magee, Hindawi could get one-third
off for good conduct and serve only 30 years.
   Hindawi, 33, was not in court.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ADULT BOOKSTORES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may use
anti-racketeering laws to close down adult bookstores.
   The justices said they will review a pair of free-speech
challenges to such an Indiana law.
   The cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana, 87-470; and
Sappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.
   
   DEATH PENALTY
   
   The court agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a
Florida man convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978.
   The court is expected to use the case to study death row
inmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal
courts for help and to decide whether Florida juries may be told
their life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trial
judge's approval.
   The case is Dugger vs. Adams, 87-121.
   
   VACCINE
   
   The court left intact a $1.13 million jury award to an Idaho boy
paralyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination for
three diseases.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the vaccine
manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to
abandon the production of essential vaccines.
   The case is Lederle Laboratories vs. Toner, 87-1151.
   
   FARM BANKRUPTCY
   
   The court ruled unanimously that financially troubled farmers
may not avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising
to use their labor, experience and expertise in continuing to
operate their farm.
   By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to
``adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law cannot be satisfied by
such a promise.
   The case is Norwest Bank Worthington vs. Ahler, 86-958.
   
   CHURCHES
   
   The court refused to free churches from having to comply with
state financial-disclosure laws when waging public referendum
campaigns.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from Jackson,
Tenn., to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and
freedom of speech.
   The case is Bemis Pentacostal vs. Tennessee, 87-317.
   
   SECRET HEARINGS
   
   The court let stand a ruling that the public has no right to
attend hearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal
trial jury while the trial is underway.
   The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess the
validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986
racketeering trial of Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards.
   The case is Times-Picayune Publishing vs. Edwards, 87-872.
   
   GLOBE LIBEL
   
   The court cleared the way for a jury trial in former
Massachusetts Gov. Edward J. King's $3.6 million libel lawsuit
against the Boston Globe.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact a
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling that a jury should hear
King's contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column.
   The case is Globe Newspaper Co. vs. King, 87-731.
   
   MOBILE HOMES
   
   The court cleared the way for a trial in what may become an
important test case on the power of cities to control rents and
otherwise protect mobile home residents.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Santa Barbara,
Calif., officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by owners of a mobile
home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of their
property's full value.
   The case is Santa Barbara vs. Hall, 87-220.
   
   JEHOVAH'S WITNESS
   
   The court refused to hear the appeal of a Florida woman who says
she was denied custody of her young child because she is a
Jehovah's Witness.
   The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings
that bar Rita Mendez from exposing her daughter to any of her
religious beliefs.
   The case is Mendez vs. Mendez, 87-1166.
   
   CITIES
   
   The court said it will try again to decide whether cities may be
sued successfully when citizens' rights are violated due to alleged
inadequate training of municipal employees.
   The justices said they will study the issue in an appeal by
Canton, Ohio officials.
   The case is Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088.

   Members of this city's influential
construction unions threw rocks and eggs and shouted pro-union
slogans today outside the annual convention of the Associated
Builders and Contractors, officials said.
   Police in helmets were called in to keep traffic flowing outside
Moscone Center, where about 2,000 demonstrators from the building
trade councils of three San Francisco Bay area counties stood
five-deep blocking buses carrying convention guests and their
families, officers reported.
   The association will seek a court injunction against the
demonstrators, said Terry Maenza, spokesman for the association.
   ``We have met this morning with unruly and irresponsible
behavior that has jeopardized the safety of our members and their
families,'' said Mike Perkins, national president of Associated
Builders and Contractors.
   The association is a fast-growing organization of 19,000
employers who hire mostly non-union workers.
   Although 2,000 association members were expected at the meeting,
only 400 had arrived when it opened.
   Union members claim the contractors' organization is seeking to
break union control of construction projects.
   About 10,000 workers are employed on construction sites
throughout the city, said Tom Thompson, director of one of the
union contractor's associations.

   Arizona's top police officer testified
today at Gov. Evan Mecham's impeachment trial that he was
``surprised and shocked'' when the governor told him not to
cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat.
   Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead told the
Senate today that Mecham told him last Nov. 15 the alleged threat
``was a family spat.''
   Impeachment charges against the 63-year-old Mecham, first-term
Republican, included a charge that he tried to thwart an
investigation of the alleged threat.
   Milstead quoted Mecham as saying, ``The attorney general is out
to hang me and I'm not going to help him in any way ... Don't tell
the attorney general anything.''
   ``He said, `Never, don't give them any help,''' Milstead said.
``This whole situation surprised and shocked me... I just cannot
cover up, even if the governor is the one telling me to do that.''
   The Senate decided earlier this morning not to grant immunity to
the man accused of making the threat, former state official Lee
Watkins.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin told lawmakers that granting
immunity to Watkins, former head of state prison construction,
could wind up protecting him from prosecution for alleged crimes
``you have no way of knowing about today.''
   Senators were considering whether to grant ``use immunity'' to
Watkins to force him to say whether he threatened the life of Donna
Carlson last November, which would have meant his testimony could
not be used against him in criminal court.
   On Friday, Watkins invoked the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in refusing to testify before the Senate.
Watkins said today that if the state grand jury probe were over he
would have no problem with testifying.
   ``These are the people (the attorney general's office) that are
out to get the governor,'' Watkins said. ``Anybody that gets in the
middle is going to get hurt.''
   Shortly after the Senate's voice vote, Watkins admitted he
hadn't expected to get immunity.
   A grant of immunity should be made only if the testimony sought
is central to the case, if lawmakers think Watkins will tell the
truth and if the immunity will not compromise a criminal
investigation, Corbin said.
   A state grand jury investigation of Watkins is continuing,
Corbin said.
   Mecham's defense lawyer, Jerris Leonard, accused prosecutors of
trying to harm Watkins' reputation in testimony last week and of
``splattering the mud broadly enough so that it splatters on the
respondent (Mecham).''
   Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead also was
scheduled to take the stand today. Mecham is accused of ordering
Milstead not to cooperate with Corbin's investigation of the
alleged threat.
   Mecham was impeached Nov. 5 by the House, which also accused him
of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from
the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Watkins has been investigated by the state grand jury in
connection with the alleged threat but has not been charged.
Attorneys said last week the inquiry was continuing.
   Last Friday, Peggy Griffith, head of the Governor's Office of
Women's Services, testified that Watkins told her Nov. 12 that Ms.
Carlson, a former special gubernatorial assistant who was about to
testify before the grand jury on the $350,000 loan, was a ``bad
girl.'' She told the trial that if Ms. Carlson kept talking ``she
is going to take a long boat ride.''
   Watkins has denied making a threat, and prosecutor William
French asked him Friday if he had taken six lie-dectector tests in
an effort to prove he hadn't made the threat. Watkins refused to
answer the question.
   Mrs. Griffith also testified that when she described the alleged
threat to Max Hawkins, then Watkins' boss, he shrugged it off as
``just a bunch of hot air.''
   Mecham, in testimony before a House impeachment committee in
January, acknowledged that he may have told Milstead not to
cooperate with the attorney general's probe. However, Mecham also
contended he was not fully informed about the seriousness of the
situation before his conversation with Milstead.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, did not attend the first five days of testimony last
week.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham and remove him from office. Mecham also faces a May 17
recall election and a March 22 criminal trial in connection with
the $350,000 campaign loan.

<HEAD>Court Will Study Appeal of Convicted Chicago Murderer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study the
appeal of a convicted Chicago murderer sentenced to 50 to 100 years
in prison for his crime.
   The justices said they will use Warren Lee Harris' case to give
federal courts some further guidance in how to handle the appeals
of defendants convicted in state courts.
   Harris was convicted of the July 19, 1977, murder in Chicago of
Earnest Howard.
   After his conviction was upheld by the Illinois courts on direct
appeal, Harris filed a so-called habeas corpus appeal in state
courts. In it, he contended for the first time that he was denied
adequate legal help at his trial.
   State courts ruled that Harris could not raise that issue
because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, but it then
rejected the merits of Harris' ineffective-assistance argument.
   Harris then sought help from the federal courts, in a habeas
corpus petition raising the same issue.
   A federal trial judge ruled that Harris' procedural default,
which usually would preclude federal court review of his claim, had
been waived by the state courts.
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June 12 ruled
that the procedural default blocks federal court review of the
ineffective-assistance argument.
   The case is Harris vs. Reed, 87-5677.

<HEAD>US Denies Preparing Retaliation for Helicopter Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six U.S. Navy ships assembled in the
southern Persian Gulf on Monday, prompting rumors of retaliation
for an Iranian attack on American helicopters, but the Navy called
the ship movements routine.
   Iran said Monday its anti-aircraft batteries fired on two
helicopters over the weekend, forcing them to withdraw, because the
choppers ignored a warning to stay clear of an ``Iranian zone'' in
the gulf. The United States issued a similar account earlier.
   Rumors of Navy action spread through shipping circles in the
gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980,
when six U.S. vessels were spotted off Dubai. They included a
chartered tanker and combat stores ship.
   The Navy denied the rumors. ``We wouldn't be planning an attack
with a supply ship,'' Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke said. ``These
movements were scheduled long before the helicopter incident.''
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the
helicopters were ``forced to flee'' by anti-aircraft fire at about
midnight Saturday.
   U.S. officials had said American helicopters took ``evasive
action'' after machine guns were fired from an oil platform and
several small boats during a scouting mission ahead of the U.S.
missile frigate Simpson. They did not say how many choppers were
involved.
   Neither report gave the location of the oil platform or named
it, but the American versian said it was not the Rostam platform,
which four U.S. destroyers shelled Oct. 19.
   Rostam has been reported under repair since the raid, described
by U.S. officials as a ``measured response'' to an attack in which
an Iranian Silkworm missile damaged a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker
anchored at Kuwait's main oil terminal.
   At the time, the U.S. officials said more severe reprisals could
be expected if Iran attacked other American ships or aircraft.
   Since last July, U.S. warships have protected Kuwaiti tankers
sailing under the American flag. Eleven of the sheikdom's tankers
have been given U.S. registration.
   The Rostam precedent combined with the sighting of the six ships
to encourage the rumors of U.S. plans for retaliation.
   Navy officers said two of the ships, the guided missile frigates
Copeland and Gary, were learning the ropes as new members of the
gulf-based fleet, the Middle East Force.
   They were escorting the 18,000-ton stores ship San Jose and the
39,000-ton oiler L.H. Gianella, both on resupply missions, Van Dyke
said.
   He said it was ``just coincidental'' that the four ships were
spotted near the missile cruiser Wainwright and missile frigate
John A. Moore, which have been in the gulf for weeks and were on
``routine escort duty'' off Dubai.
   In the Navy's gulf operation, which has been cut from 17 to 16
ships, the Copeland and Gary are expected to replace sister
frigates McClusky and Reuben James, the next vessels slated to
depart under Navy policy that limits duty tours to six months,
port-to-port.
   Iran's account of the helicopter incident said: ``Two U.S.
helicopters attempting to approach an Iranian zone in the Persian
Gulf early Sunday were forced to flee by the anti-aircraft fire of
naval forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
   ``The navy anti-aircraft detected the two helicopters on its
radar and warned them to stay out of the Iranian zone. However, the
Iranian navy fired warning shots after the U.S. helicopters
violated the Iranian zone.''
   Nothing was said in the U.S. version about a warning before the
shooting started.
   It was the second time in a month that Iran claimed to have
driven off American helicopters with anti-aircraft fire. U.S.
officials denied the first Iranian report, of a similar incident
Feb. 12 at Sirri island in the south central Gulf.
   Iran uses some oil platforms and small islands in the gulf as
bases for armed speedboats that attack commercial shipping.
   There have been no such attacks since Feb. 11, and no Iraqi air
raids on Iran's own oil shipping since Feb. 12 _ one of the longest
lulls in the ``tanker war'' since it began in February 1984.
   Iran and Iraq have been attacking each other's capitals and
other cities since Feb. 29, in a new round of the ``war of the
cities'' that has cost thousands of lives during the 7{-year-old
war.

   The Reagan administration said today it has
protested poor maintenance of some Panama Canal facilities, but
said the problem was not linked to the recent political turmoil
there.
   ``There are some facilities that are maintained by Panama that
we have protested in a sense of not being adequately maintained,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said the complaint was registered ``sometime previously'' and
was not intended to justify an abrogation of the Panama Canal
treaty.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported that political appointees
installed by the Panamanian government are mismanaging operations
of the canal that have been turned over by the United States.
   ``Any user of those facilities will tell you there are
difficulties now that simply did not exist 10 years ago,'' an
unidentified Panamanian economist told The New York Times.
   Among the facilities suffering from mismanagement are ports,
marine bunkering installations, a railroad, a bridge and air
traffic control, according to the Times, which interviewed canal
employees and shipping experts.
   ``This government has put a political aspect to an equation that
has no room for politics,'' said a Panamanian engineer who has
worked at the canal for more than a decade. ``As soon as you start
to mix Panamanian politics with the running of the canal, that is
the end of things.''
   The country's political situation has been particularly troubled
in recent weeks. Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military leader
who is Panama's de facto leader, engineered the ouster of President
Eric Arturo Delvalle after Delvalle tried to fire him.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding,
as Panama's rightful president and has brought economic pressure to
bear to oust Noriega. Noriega is also under indictment in the
United States for alleged drug trafficking.
   Panama is scheduled to take control of the waterway in the year
2000, according to the 1977 treaties. But some of the 7,000 canal
employees, 83 percent of whom are Panamanians, fear that domestic
political interference could hinder their ability to run the canal
professionally, the Times said.
   ``As the year 2000 approaches, it is going to be necessary for
laws to keep this organization a bit apart from the normal
government structure, so there is no interference by other
ministries or the implantation of political but unskilled people in
the upper echelons,'' said Dennis P. McAuliffe, an American and
chief administrator of the canal.
   A Panamanian civil engineer told the newspaper that derailments
on the railroad have increased because of lack of maintenance and
that rail yards ``are in a state of disrepair.''
   Shipping lines complain that lights and gangways don't work and
that fenders along docks are not maintained.
   The Panama Defense Forces have taken some of the best office
buildings for their own use as warehouses or as prisons, the Times
reported, forcing some canal operations to move elsewhere.

   President Reagan lashed out today at
congressional opponents to Contra aid, accusing them of a lack of
courage in the battle against communism in Central America.
   In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, Reagan
talked about the votes last week in Congress that left the rebels
battling the leftist government of Nicragua without U.S. funding.
   The 216-208 vote defeated a Democratic plan to provide $30.8
million in food, clothing and medical aid to the rebels. The vote
was scheduled by the Democratic leadership so the House could not
vote on an aid plan favored by the Republicans.
   ``Courage hasn't exactly been the watchword of some opponents of
Contra aid,'' Reagan said. ``... Last week, aid opponents tried to
pass the buck of responsibility for abandoning in the field the
young men and women of the Democratic resistance, and that ploy
failed as it should have.''
   Administration officials have expressed the hope Congress could
come up with an alternative plan to keep the rebels alive as a
fighting force.
   After Reagan's speech, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
acknowledged that a ``real problem'' exists for the administration
because a new Contra aid package might not be considered for some
time.
   ``It's just a matter of time,'' he said. ``We will produce a
package,'' he vowed at another point.
   In his speech, Reagan recalled that Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega dismissed Cardinal Obando y Bravo as the mediator in peace
talks with the rebels.
   ``You know where Ortega stands. Isn't it time for Congress to
have the courage to show where it stands?'' Reagan asked
rhetorically.
   ``Now it's time for Congress to show that it knows you can't
have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships
and the other has bandages,'' he said.
   Reagan said the defeat of the Contras would mean a ``grave
strategic defeat for the United States.''
   ``The communists in Central America understand this, the Soviets
understand this _ it's time that Congress understood it, too,''
Reagan said, adding, ``A Soviet base on the American mainland is a
pistol pointed at the heart of the Americas.''
   Reagan contended that the ``real issue'' before the Congress is
not the Contras, ``it is communisim in Central America.''
   The president, who was warmly greeted by the audience of older
veterans, told them of his recent trip to Brussels, Belgium, where
he met with NATO leaders. He asked their support for the
ratification of the recently signed U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
medium-range nuclear missles from Europe.
   Reagan also called on Congress to reject further cuts in the
nation's defense budget and allow for a strong alliance defense.
   ``This is not the time to drop our guard,'' Reagan said. ``It's
just this simple. If we put Americans in harm's way, we owe them
the best weapons money can buy.''
   ``We'll need to keep up our strength if we're to succeed, and
that's why the Congress must not further reduce the defense
budget,'' Reagan said.
   Offering a report on the Brussels meeting in his Saturday radio
address, Reagan declared that ``arms reduction is not enough'' in
dealing with the Soviets and demanded they abandon the ``offensive
strategy'' displayed against the Western alliance on the European
continent.
   Reagan said there was a ``lesson learned'' at the meeting, which
was the first full-scale summit for the leaders of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in six years.
   ``One must always negotiate with the Soviets from a position of
strength,'' Reagan said.
   Following the NATO summit, a White House advance team traveled
to Moscow to scout out possible sites for the fourth meeting
between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, planned for
late May or early June.
   In his radio speech, Reagan pointed out that while the allies
praised the new U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove all medium-range
nuclear missiles from Europe, they reaffirmed the need to remain
united and keep their guard up.
   ``That's why continued modernization of NATO forces _ nuclear
and conventional _ is essential,'' Reagan said.

   The U.S. government is seeking the dismissal
of a lawsuit that would end federal aid to religious schools
abroad, primarily Jewish schools in Israel, a prosecutor said
Monday.
   Bernard Bell, an assistant U.S. attorney in New York's Southern
District, said he filed papers in federal court Friday arguing that
the case ought to be dropped because the American Civil Liberties
Union does not have ``standing,'' a legal term which means the
right to bring the lawsuit.
   But C. Edwin Baker, a staff attorney the ACLU in New York, said
the civil liberties group maintains that it can pursue the lawsuit
because the ACLU represents American taxpayers whose money is used
for the schools. The ACLU has until March 24 to respond.
   The lawsuit stemmed from reports last December that Sen. Daniel
K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, had persuaded his colleagues to allocate $8
million to build schools in France for North African Jews.
   The program provoked a firestorm of criticism, prompting Inouye
to ask Congress to rescind the money. Lawmakers agreed to Inouye's
wish.
   After President Reagan signed the bill killing the $8 million
program last month, the ACLU amended its complaint to cover Jewish
and Catholic schools that receive money under the American Schools
and Hospitals Abroad program, which is administered by the Agency
for International Development.
   Baker said lawyers learned about the program in the course of
their research into the Inouye-supported item.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, claims
that providing money to ``pervasively sectarian schools'' or for
construction of sectarian schools is a violation of the
Constitution's First Amendment calling for separation of church and
state. The ACLU asks the court to block further spending on the
schools.
   Under the schools and hospitals program _ a favorite in Congress
_ grants are awarded to a non-profit American organization that
sponsors an institution overseas. The program is designed to
promote American educational methods abroad and train foreigners in
medicine and promote American educational values.
   AID, which has regulations governing the program, awards the
grants on a competitive basis. Congress is notified before the
money is spent.
   The budget figures indicate how fond Congress is of the program.
In fiscal year 1988, AID asked for $10 million; Congress increased
the budget to $40 million. The previous fiscal year the program
received $35 million.
   The ACLU is not challenging grants given to hospitals or
non-sectarian schools abroad, Baker said. But the group wants to
end support for schools that have as a stated goal the teaching of
principles and doctrines of Roman Catholicism and orthodox Judaism.
   AID documents for the four years ending in 1986 show that
institutions in Lebanon were given the most money, a total of $24.8
million. The lion's share _ $24 million _ went to the American
University of Beirut.
   Institutions in Israel snagged the second largest amount of
money, a total of $20.2 million. Project HOPE, which operates
schools worldwide, received $14.3 million.
   All of the religious schools named in the lawsuit are in Israel.
   Among the institutions which teach Judaism and have received
money since fiscal 1983 are: The American College of Belz,
Jerusalem, $500,000; Beth Rivka Comprehensive School, Kfar Chabad,
$750,000; Beth Yaacov Avat, Ashdod, $100,000; Boys Town, Jerusalem,
$1.2 million; Emunah Women of America Community College, Jerusalem,
$650,000; Gan Yavne Youth Village, Gan Yavne, $150,000; Machaniam
High School, Kiryat Gat, $400,000; Ohr Somayach School, Jerusalem,
$2 million' Sha'Alvim Teachers' College, D.N. Agalon, $400,000.
   The lawsuit does not name any Catholic schools for which it
wants to eliminate money.

   Script writers struck movie and television
producers today and the union predicted viewers of talk shows, game
shows and daytime soaps would quickly notice a difference in
programming.
   Hundreds of writers grabbed ``The Writers Guild Strikes''
placards depicting a quill and lightning bolt as mid-morning picket
lines snaked in front of Twentieth Century Fox studios.
   The Writers Guild of America rejected a final offer presented
Sunday by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
and called a walkout for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. The 600 WGA
news writers are exempt from this action.
   The strike began here and in New York City at 9 a.m. PST today.
The contract expired at midnight Feb. 29.
   Marty Waldman, a WGA spokesman in New York, said there would be
no picketing in the East today.
   ``The longer the strike goes on, the more reruns the public will
see,'' said Brian Walton, WGA West executive director and chief
negotiator. ``It's a very tight ratings race and unfortunately for
the networks it will impact them.''
   Picket captain Stanley Ralph Ross said selection of Fox's West
Los Angeles studio ``was fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and
location had a lot to do with it.
   ``We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking around
here,'' Ross said.
   ``Grandview U.S.A.'' writer Ken Hixon, who marched with his
2-year old son, Sam, said writers were much more unified for this
strike than in their last walkout in 1985.
   ``There was nearly a civil war last time between screen writers
and television writers. But this time there's real solidarity,''
Hixon said.
   ``Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs
relying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and the
soaps will see a difference right away,'' said guild spokeswoman
Cheryl Rhoden.
   The strike slows down the production process and if prolonged,
``it finally comes to a halt,'' she said. A three-month strike
delayed the fall television season three years ago.
   Walton said the network that would be hardest hit would be
first-place NBC, whose ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,''
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Late Night With David Letterman,''
would be affected immediately.
   Edward Adler, president of WGA East, said nine soap operas on
the East Coast and five in California also would be affected
immediately, as would prime time miniseries, television movies and
features in development or in production.
   But Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the alliance, which
represents 200 producers and studios, said a strike was anticipated
and scripts have been stockpiled.
   ``Shows like Carson's show will go into reruns. But we will
continue business,'' he said.
   Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some
one-hour shows syndicated in the United States and said they
couldn't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets.
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000 a year, but
about half of the guild's members are unemployed at any given time,
said Rhoden. The writers sought the first change in 17 years in how
they are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets.
They now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is
negotiated between the writer and producer.
   The writers also demanded more artistic control on the final
product.
   ``We had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short of
giving them total control,'' Steinberg said. ``The director is the
captain of that creative team. We couldn't bargain away rights that
belonged to other guilds and unions.''
   The producers had offered a $50 million package over a
three-year period, including improvements in pension and health
plans, Steinberg said.
   In union ballots last week in Los Angeles and New York, 96
percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached.
   The last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks.
Since the WGA won its first contract in 1947, script writers
conducted strikes five times, more than any other entertainment
industry union.
   Separately, the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists bargained through the weekend with
makers of TV and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerun
payments for 100,000 actors.
   Members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent margin
in recent votes, said SAG spokesman Mark Locher.

   President Reagan's spokesman said today the
administration welcomes ``the support and advice'' of 30 senators
who argued in a letter to Secretary of State George Shultz that
Israel should be willing to give up control of occupied land in
return for Middle East peace.
   ``We are in the midst of an ongoing processs. The views of these
senators are helpful to us and probably instructive to other
parties in the region,'' Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   The 23 Democrats and seven Republicans, including several strong
supporters of the Jewish state, also expressed support for Shultz's
plan to bring Israel, Jordan, Syria and Palestinian Arabs to a
peace conference by May 1 in an effort to stop violence in
Israeli-occupied territory that has claimed some 80 Arab lives in
three months.
   The senators noted that Israel has in the past supported the
idea of ``land for peace'' by returning the Sinai peninsula to
Egypt. But they cited a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir that ``this expression of territory for peace is not
accepted by me.''
   ``We hope that the prime minister's statement did not indicate
that Israel is abandoning a policy that offers the best hope for
long-term peace,'' the letter said.
   ``The administration welcomes the support and advice from this
group. They are senators of considerable stature and interest and
involvment in Middle East affairs,'' the spokesman said.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles E. Redman said Shultz
would respond to the letter. He declined to address the matter
further, except to say that the administration prefers ``to
maintain a certain discreet distance'' in the Mideast peace process.
   But Redman, in a comment that seemed to be directed at Shamir,
said the State Department hopes for an ``early response'' from
Mideast governments to the U.S. plan to set up negotiations on
Palestinian self-rule by May 1.
   ``We believe all the parties understand and appreciate the
reason that we've asked for these kind of responses,'' Redman told
reporters.
   Shamir on Sunday blocked a decision by the Israeli Cabinet. He
said he would permit a vote on the American initiative after he
returns from talks here next week with Reagan and Shultz.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres had demanded a Cabinet
decision before Shamir went to Washington.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said Shultz was to brief Reagan
later today on his Middle East trips and he noted that Shamir is to
visit with the president on March 16.
   ``At the moment, we proceed on a pace that's fairly well
structured and has been laid out by Secretary Shultz and his
shuttle diplomacy of the last several days,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said the administration was involved in a process
``that involves a blend of some new ideas and new beliefs,'' but he
refused to comment further, saying, ``in the Middle East, it's more
important not to say anything that prohibits the process or acts as
a stoppage than to say anything that might stimulate activity.''
   Shultz, upon returning Saturday from the Middle East, expressed
no criticism of Shamir's position, saying the prime minister and
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres agreed that Israel's
annexation of territory could be a topic for negotiations. Peres
and his Labor Party have openly endorsed Shultz's proposals, while
Shamir and his Likud Party have not.
   Strong supporters of Israel signing the letter included senators
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Frank R.
Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.
   Others whose names were on the letter included senators Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii; Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn.; George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine; Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D.;
J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa; Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; J.
James Exon, D-Neb.; Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.; John Kerry, D-Mass.;
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky; William S. Cohen, R-Maine; Alan K. Simpson,
R-Wyo.; Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo.;
Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.

<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with administration
expressing concern about violence in Tibet.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Reagan administration expressed deep
concern today about violence in Tibet as Chinese Foreign Minister
Wu Xueqian opened talks with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``We remain deeply concerned about the state of human rights in
Tibet and the recurring incidents of violence,'' said Charles E.
Redman, the State Department spokesman. ``We urge all concerned to
exercise restraint in order to avoid further bloodshed.''
   At the same time, Redman said Tibet is considered an integral
part of China. ``Nothing has changed on that,'' he said.
   Redman said he expected Shultz would take up the situation with
Wu during their talks.
   The State Department and Congress have accused China of harsh
measures in putting down unrest in Tibet.
   Reports that reached Beijing on Sunday said thousands of rioting
Tibetans had set bonfires in Lhasa's streets and several people
were killed during more than 12 hours of clashes with police. The
protesters were demanding Tibet's independence from China.
   Police fired bullets and tear gas at protesters Saturday and
three to nine people were killed, according to the unconfirmed
reports from Western sources in Lhasa.
   The administration, meanwhile, is dangling high-technology sales
as an inducement for China to give firm assurances it will halt
delivery of Silkworm missiles to Iran.
   The tradeoff _ and at least Chinese neutrality in a U.S. drive
to impose an international arms embargo against Iran _ looms as the
potential highlight of the talks Wu opened today.
   It is his first visit in four years, and the agenda is
substantial. For instance, Shultz will solicit China's support for
his proposal for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   Shultz is trying to structure a peace conference in which the
United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France would
serve as sponsors, but without the power to impose terms of a
settlement.
   That calls for some delicate diplomacy. Shultz is walking a
tightrope between Jordan and Israel on the subject.
   King Hussein refuses to negotiate unless he has Big Power
support. But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refuses to allow
China or the Soviets, who usually support Arab positions, to take
an active role.
   Wu arrived Sunday, had dinner with Shultz and sees him and
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci separately today. On Tuesday,
the Chinese foreign minister calls on President Reagan at the White
House and meets with Shultz again.
   The shipping war in the Persian Gulf is uppermost in U.S. minds.
   China may be Iran's largest arms supplier. Sales last year were
worth an estimated $1 billion.
   The most dangerous of the weapons are Silkworm missiles _
short-range rockets that even in unskilled hands can wreak havoc on
merchant ships. Iran has used them effectively.
   Despite U.S. appeals, China persisted in delivering installments
of the Silkworms to Iran last year _ and denied what Carlucci and
other U.S. officials said it was doing.
   Frustrated, the United States retaliated in October by
suspending a decade-old process of liberalizing the types of high
technology American companies could sell to China.
   Since then, China has said it has stopped selling Silkworms to
Iran. A U.S. official, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity,
said ``our information is that they've been living up to that.''
   Still, before resuming liberalization of the high-technology
trade, ``we want to be sure we're in sync with the Chinese on what
we're talking about,'' the official said. ``We want to be sure that
this responsiveness will continue.''
   On an arms embargo, meanwhile, Shultz would like a commitment
from Wu that China would not veto a resolution in the U.N. Security
Council to impose a worldwide arms embargo against Iran.
   The sanctions would enforce a cease-fire resolution adopted last
July that Iraq accepted but Iran scorned.
   State Department experts believe China would at least remain
neutral if the Soviet Union agreed not to veto the resolution. The
United States has been after Moscow since July for support, but is
not sure it has it yet.

   Commerce Secretary William Verity will lead a
U.S. delegation to the Soviet Union in April for a conference on
trade and economic cooperation, the Commerce Department said Monday.
   The meeting, of the Joint U.S.-U.S.S.R Commercial Commission, is
being held as a follow-up to the December summit meeting between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The two leaders, in a joint statement at the end of the summit
in Washington, instructed the commission to develop proposals to
expand the two nations' trade and economic ties.
   It will be the 10th meeting of the commission, which last met
December 1986 in Washington.
   While in Moscow, during the week of April 11, Verity will meet
with Gorbachev and address the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic
Council, an organization of U.S. companies and Soviet firms.
   Verity will be accompanied by representatives of the
Agriculture, Treasury and State departments, the National Security
Council and the office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

his ailing wife.
   Oscar Carlson entered pleas of innocent and innocent by reason
of mental deficiency to charges of first- and second-degree murder
in Douglas County District Court.
   Carlson is charged with the shooting death last week of his wife
of 47 years. He reportedly told authorities he shot the 71-year-old
woman to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
   Michael Dolan, an attorney for Carlson, said he asked the court
to reduce Carlson's $100,000 bail, and allow the man to post his
home and five acres as assurance against flight. Douglas County
Judge Donald Gray took the matter under advisement.
   Meanwhile, Carlson remained at the Douglas County Jail, Dolan
said.

   The Reagan administration is considering
economic and trade sanctions against Panama, including withholding
monthly payments for the Panama Canal, but has not made any
decisions yet, a White House spokesman said today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said meetings will be held later this
week to discuss options on how the United States can apply pressure
to force the ouster of Panama's military strongman, Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   On March 15, the United States is due to pay $6.5 million to the
Panama Canal Commission, a monthly payment toward the $75 million
to $80 million the United States makes each year under the Panama
Canal treaty.
   One of the options under consideration, Fitzwater said, is to
put the money into an escrow account instead of paying it to Panama.
   Earlier in the day, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said the
United States was right to put economic pressure on Noriega's
government, which D'Amato predicted would fall within 10 days.
   ``We are grinding him down to a halt, and we should,'' D'Amato
said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   ``I think we could have moved much faster,'' added D'Amato, who
is sponsoring a Senate resolution calling for a total trade embargo
against Panama.
   ``We begin to see the incredible effects that we do have
economically,'' the New York Republican said.
   Panama's 12 local banks have been closed since Tuesday; branches
of international institutions closed their doors Friday.
   The administration last week backed legal efforts to freeze
Panamanian government deposits in U.S. banks, and authorities in
Panama were prevented from drawing on those accounts to keep the
nation supplied with U.S. dollars, the official currency of Panama.
   Calling the Panamanian strongman a terrorist and ``petty
tyrant,'' D'Amato asked:
   ``If we can't take Noriega on with the power that we have in the
area economically, militarily, ... how are we going to deal with
the drug lords of Mexico and Colombia and Bolivia and when are we
really going to take on that war?''
   ``This is an opportunity and time for us to strike a blow for
democracy and to go after one of the drug lords in this
hemisphere,'' he said.
   Questioned as to when he thinks Noriega will be forced from
power, D'Amato replied, ``I would say within 10 days.''
   Appearing with D'Amato, Juan B. Sosa, the ambassador of Panama's
deposed president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, agreed with that
prediction.

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 12
Palestinians on Monday, and the army said Arab rioters hurled a
grenade for the first time since violence began in the occupied
territories three months ago.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended the behavior of soldiers
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He told Parliament it was
the first time in Israel's 40-year history ``in which face-to-face,
close, they see the ... hate of the rioters.''
   Strikes and job boycotts extended to the administration of the
territories. Palestinian employees of the Gaza tax department were
summoned to military headquarters Monday after 38 of the 40 workers
said they were resigning.
   Inside Israel, Palestinian guerrillas captured a commuter bus
near Beersheba and soldiers stormed the vehicle. Three Israelis and
three guerrillas were killed.
   According to the army spokesman's office, soldiers shot and
wounded seven Palestinians at Idna after attackers threw a grenade
at troopers who raided the West Bank village to arrest ``rioters
and inciters of rioting.'' The Arab-run Palestine Press Service put
the number of wounded at eight.
   It was the first use of a grenade since Arab riots began Dec. 8.
   The first army report of Arab gunfire in a demonstration
occurred Sunday in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus. No soldiers
were injured.
   Israeli surveillance and restrictions make it difficult for
Arabs to get firearms, and the Palestine Liberation Organization
has ordered protesters to avoid using guns.
   International sympathy has been created by images of well-armed
soldiers shooting and beating youths armed only with rocks and
homemade gasoline bombs in what Arabs call ``the uprising.''
According to U.N. figures, 83 Palestinians have been killed.
   At Al-Ittihad hospital in Nablus, Dr. Hamdallah Kazlak said two
Palestinians were treated for gunshot wounds suffered in clashes
with troops at the nearby Balata refugee camp.
   He said 20-25 others from Balata and the Askar camp were treated
for injuries caused by clubs, rubber bullets or tear gas, including
a 4-year-old girl hit in the head by a rubber bullet.
   A 33-year-old Arab from Askar, Salah Eddin Abdul-Raouf, was dead
on arrival at the hospital and Kazlak said his relatives attributed
the death to tear gas. He said the cause of death was unclear,
however, and noted the man suffered from heart disease.
   Army officials said they were investigating reports of the
protests.
   Hospital officials in the Gaza Strip said soldiers shot and
wounded three Arabs during protests on the anniversary of Israel's
withdrawal from the strip soon after invading it in 1956. Israel
captured Gaza from Egypt, and the West Bank from Jordan, in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Army spokesmen said soldiers opened fire when rubber bullets and
tear gas did not disperse ``a violent demonstration in the Shati
camp,'' wounding three Palestinians.
   The hospital officials, speaking anonymously, said more than 100
people were treated for beatings and injuries caused by tear gas
and rubber bullets, most suffered at Shati.
   Military authorities summoned employees of the Gaza tax
department to discuss a Sunday letter signed by 38 of the 40
workers saying they were resigning in response to a call by
underground Palestinian leaders.
   A senior official said the Israelis explained the financial
difficulties workers would face if they quit and ``the general
situation in terms of public services that will be damaged.'' He
said the workers had not yet resigned officially.
   Israeli officials claim Arab government workers in the
territories have been threatened by Palestinian nationalists and
Islamic militants.

   The United States has been embarassed in space
research since the Challenger disaster, and risks forfeiting its
edge in high technology and other fields unless it expands
space-based scientific missions, a NASA official and researchers
told a congressional hearing Monday.
   Further delays in projects already backed up three years plus a
lack of funding for new space experiments will allow the Soviet
Union, Japan and European nations to cement the lead they have
taken over the United States since the Challenger explosion, said
Lennard A. Fisk, associate administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``A lead that we had was allowed to erode and now we have to ask
ourselves where we are going,'' said Fisk, who outlined the
science-related portion of NASA's proposed fiscal 1989 budget to
the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space.
   Fisk said 20 major science-related payloads are scheduled to be
carried into space in the next four years, half of them aboard
space shuttles and half on expendable rockets.
   The projects include probes to Venus and Jupiter and the
launching of an X-ray telescope, space telescope and gamma ray
observatory designed to work in tandem to study a number of
phenomena, including a supernova that occurred last year.
   The new X-ray telescope, the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics
Facility, should also help researchers determine what the universe
looked like up to 20 billion years ago and produce dramatic
improvements in pharmaceuticals and computer chips, said Dr. Harvey
Tananbaum of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
   Resumption of the shuttle program and approval of NASA's
science-related budget is vital to getting the 20 projects launched
by 1993 and to prove to commercial businesses which pay to have
satellites and experiments carried into space that the Unites
States will re-establish itself as a dominant force in space, Fisk
said.
   He also urged researchers to develop new space-based experiments
and technology so that NASA can begin planning missions past 1993,
when it is scheduled to complete current projects.
   ``We have a hiatus in space science launches today because of
the Challenger tragedy,'' Fisk said. ``Let us not create another
hiatus in the mid-1990s by failing to start major flight projects
now.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a subcommittee member who presided
over the hearing, said a revitalized space program also was vital
to Massachusetts businesses and universities, which received 846
contracts totaling $413 million in 1987 and have to date in 1988
been awarded 710 contracts totaling $388 million.
   Fisk and the academicians told the subcommittee that NASA should
not be pressured to curtail manned missions with civilian
researchers because of the January 1986 Challenger explosion that
killed seven astronauts, including New Hampshire teacher Christa
McAuliffe.
   David L. Akin, associate director of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology Space Systems Laboratory, said that while computers
and robots can greatly contribute to space research, their
advancement should not be used to support calls for an end to
manned space flights.
   ``Exploration is one of the last jobs which should be turned
over to robots, as the curiosity for thirst and knowledge
underlying the urge to explore is one of the finest attributes of
being human,'' Akin said. ``Let us instead spend our efforts
getting humans out of mine shafts and off high steel construction
sites. Robots should totally replace man in the worst of jobs, not
the best.''

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Holds Special Prayer Service for Tibet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama, god-king of Tibetans,
held a prayer service Monday in northern India to mourn weekend
violence in Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
   In New Delhi, hundreds of Tibetan refugees chanted ``We shall
overcome'' in a demonstration solidarity with people in Tibet.
Police prevented the crowd from marching on the Chinese Embassy.
   A statement from the Dalai Lama's New Delhi office said the
trouble in Lhasa ``is yet another indication of the depth of
Tibetan people's resentment and opposition to Chinese rule.''
   Hundreds of Tibetans attended the service in Dharmsala, the
Dalai Lama's exile headquarters in northern Himachal Pradesh state,
the statement said. It declared that the Tibetan issue ``cannot be
solved by use of force'' and called on China ``to seriously
negotiate for a solution.''
   In a statement from Dharmsala, the Dalai Lama urged the Chinese
to ``work toward a settlement which will benefit both the Tibetan
and the Chinese peoples.'' He asked that Tibetans ``in the meantime
... refrain from violence in spite of repressive measures that the
Chinese may take.''
   Official reports in China said one policeman was killed and 28
were injured in the Lhasa clash Saturday. Unconfirmed reports from
Western sources put the toll at three to nine dead, including a
Buddhist monk and two Chinese policemen.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India with about 100,000 of his followers
in 1959, after an abortive Tibetan uprising. China, which claims
Tibet has been an integral part of it for centuries, moved troops
into the remote mountain region in 1950.
   Saturday's violence was the first in Lhasa since Oct. 1, when
2,000 Tibetans led by Buddhist monks set fire to a police station
facing the Jokhang Temple. Police opened fire and at least 14
people were reported killed.
   Many Tibetans resent the government in Beijing because of
oppression of Tibetan religion and customs and destruction of
temples during the 1966-76 radical Cultural Revolution.
   Although China has tried to redress past wrongs, friction
remains between Tibetans and Chinese who continue to hold many
senior posts in Lhasa.
   The Tibetan government has refused nearly all requests by
foreign journalists to visit Lhasa and has restricted tourism since
the disturbances last October.

   A prisoner handcuffed to a hospital bed broke
the bed rail Monday and overpowered his police guard, then took the
officer's gun and held two people hostage before giving up about
six hours later.
   The prisoner freed the hostages, both hospital engineers, but
continued to hold police off while threatening to shoot himself or
fire into potentially explosive tanks of acetylene and oxygen in a
subbasement of North General Hospital in Harlem.
   ``He was rational but very upset,'' said Detective Frank
Gallagher, the chief negotiator. ``He had fits of depression and at
one point put the gun to his head and at another point to his
mouth.''
   The prisoner, identified as Yusuf Harris, 27, freed himself
around 4:25 a.m. in his seventh-floor room at the hospital, where
he had been taken for treatment of exposure after being arrested on
kidnap charges early Saturday, officials said.
   Authorities were investigating how he broke his bed rail without
alerting the guard, officer Timothy Austin, in a hallway outside,
said Chief of Patrol John P. McCabe said.
   After getting Austin's gun, the barefoot Harris, wearing only a
hospital gown and dragging a wedge-shaped section of aluminum-pipe
bed rail from his wrist, made his way to the second floor, where he
got the drop on a security guard, according to patients who saw the
incident.
   Harris allegedly took the guard's wallet, with $7, then forced
him to break open a window leading onto a setback.
   Around this time Harris fired Austin's .38-caliber service
revolver, Chief Robert Johnston said, but it was not known whether
the discharge was accidental or Harris had tried to hit someone. No
one was shot.
   Harris made his way to the subbasement, where he burned his
buttocks while clambering over a boiler, said Johnston.
   He took his hostages, Ray Cadmus, 50, of Nesconset, and Kemail
Bajramoski, 35, of Manhattan, at the engineers' office, said
police. One of the captives freed Harris from the bed rail by
chiseling the handcuff chain.
   Cadmus was freed at 7:20 a.m. after police sent in some coffee
and doughnuts, said Johnston. Bajramoski was let go about an hour
later when Gallagher agreed to stay with Harris in place of the
hostage.
   ``He said he wanted to blow himself up but he didn't want to go
alone,'' said Gallagher.
   Later, the officer saw the prisoner turn the gun on himself.
   ``He said to me, `You want to see me do it? I'll do it right
now,''' Gallagher related.
   Gallagher quoted Harris as saying he had tried to escape because
he feared going back into the criminal justice system.
   The prisoner was calmed by talking on the telephone to his
father and sister and to an assistant district attorney, Steven
Nuzzi, who were brought to the hospital.
   Finally, he threw the gun out ``and walked out and took my
hand,'' said Gallagher.
   Still barefoot, but with a red plaid shirt and a sheet over his
gown, Harris was brought out at 10:45 a.m.
   McCabe said he would be charged with robbery, reckless
endangerment and weapon possession.
   Austin, 28, who was treated for cuts and bruises, had arrested
Harris originally early Saturday after Harris allegedly used a
starter's pistol to force a cabbie to drive him from the Bronx to
Manhattan.
   Harris fled the cab and jumped into the East River when the
driver got the attention of police in eastern Harlem, authorities
said. Harbor police fished him out and Austin arrested him on
charges of kidnap, menacing and gun and marijuana possession,
police said.
   He had been taken to the hospital for treatment and observation.

<HEAD>Convicted Palestinian Terrorists Loses Bid to Halt Deportation
Proceedings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian convicted in a terrorist attack on
an Israeli jetliner lost out Monday in his bid to block the
Canadian government's attempt to deport him.
   Federal court Justice James Jerome dismissed an application from
Mahmoud Mohammad Issa's lawyers, who argued that the scheduled
March 15 deportation hearing would violate Canada's Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.
   The attorneys said that Mohammad, 45, will not get a fair
hearing because Immigration Minister Benoit Bouchard has already
told Parliament that ``the government will not rest before he
(Mohammad) is out of the country.''
   The judge said Bouchard's comments could have been more
temperate. But he said the process ``also involves a sense of
fairness to Canada'' and is necessary to assess ``who should come
in and who should not.''
   Lorne Waldman, one of Mohammad's lawyers, said he was filing an
immediate appeal of the decision and a request for a stay in
deportation proceedings until the appeal is heard.
   In 1970, a Greek court convicted Mohammad of manslaughter for
his part in a 1968 attack on an El Al airliner at Athens airport
that left one Israeli passenger dead. He served three months of his
17-year sentence and was released in a hostage exchange.
   He came to Canada with his wife and three children a year ago
and established a comfortable suburban life in Brantford, Ontario.
   When reporters discovered his presence in the country in
January, Mohammad acknowledged having lied about his criminal
record to gain entry to Canada. But he said he renounced terrorism
and avowed to live here peacefully.
   Some left-wing groups and newspaper columnists have been
sympathetic to his case.
   However, his claim to have renounced Palestinian terrorism long
ago has been challenged by the Israeli Airline Pilots Association,
which claims Mohammad was involved in a 1986 plot to attack a
Jewish settlement in Morocco.
   In addition, the Montreal newspaper, Le Devoir, has reported the
existence of an autobiographical book about Mohammad which depicts
him as an active terrorist in 1975.
   Mohammad has denied both allegations.
   Mohammad tried to leave Canada quietly last month through a
secret Royal Canadian Mounted Police operation. The plan called for
him to fly to London's Heathrow Airport and change planes for
Algiers, possibly continuing on to Morocco.
   Authorities have not clarified exactly what went wrong. Mohammad
flew to London but was put on a plane back to Toronto.

<HEAD>Chain Store Heiress Wins Church Estate She Forced Into Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An heiress who was awarded $6 million
from a church she said exploited her won The Bible Speaks' 65-acre
headquarters Monday with a $3.23 million bid at an auction in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.
   It was the second time that Elizabeth Dovydenas, 35, of Lenox,
had outbid others for the church's now-abandoned property, which
includes 23 buildings. Judge James F. Queenan Jr. had rejected her
November bid of $1.8 million as too low.
   ``I'd be happy either way,'' said Mrs. Dovydenas' husband,
Jonas, after learning the couple's bid was the highest of the four
sealed bids at the court hearing.
   The money Mrs. Dovydenas bid for the estate will go toward
repaying the $6.6 million claim she won in federal Bankruptcy Court
last April against The Bible Speaks.
   She had sued the church for donations she made as a parishioner
from 1982 to 1986, contending that she was lied to and that her
unquestioning trust was exploited by church founder and leader Rev.
Carl H. Stevens Jr.
   Queenan agreed in his ruling, calling the case ``an astonishing
saga of clerical deceit, avarice and subjugation on the part of the
church's founder.''
   The ruling was upheld in January in U.S. District Court in
Springfield, but the church's lawyers have announced they intend to
file an appeal.
   The dispute landed in federal Bankrupcy Court after the church
obtained Chapter 11 protection, arguing that Mrs. Dovydenas' case
could forced it into insolvency.
   The claim by Mrs. Dovydenas, an heir to the Dayton Hudson
department store fortune, is by far the largest of the 250
creditors who are owed a total of $7 million by the church.
   Her lawyer, Gordon Walker, said he doubted she will ever receive
all the money she won, although another piece of church property in
Maine recently sold for $1.1 million and a Florida condominium and
a mission ship are also up for sale by a court-appointed trustee.
   ``I hope we even get $4 million,'' the attorney said. ``The
question is, where did all that money go? We're going to look into
that question.''
   The Bible Speaks had claimed 1,200 members worldwide until the
ministry disbanded last summer, saying it would never operate under
the control of a court-appointed trustee. The trustee, David
Ferrari, had been apppointed by the bankrutpcy court to manage the
estate until Mrs. Dovydenas' claim could be paid.
   Most of the church's 20 pastors followed Stevens to Baltimore,
although a few remained behind to set up another church in Lenox.
   The church's Lenox estate had been valued at $6 million, but
investors said town zoning restrictions made it difficult to
develop the land.
   Dovydenas said Monday he and his wife planned to sell some of
the church property to developers and turn some of it into a school
and a community center for the wealthy town, the summer home of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.

   A federal judge on Monday dismissed GOP
presidential candidate Pat Robertson's $35 million libel suit
against a former congressman, who said the court's action unmasked
Robertson ``as the fraud he is.''
   Robertson, complaining he could not campaign and pursue the suit
at the same time, had asked for the dismissal. He called Monday's
action ``a real victory.''
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green formally ended the suit
against former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif., who had
questioned Robertson's Korean War record, after Robertson agreed to
pay court costs.
   Green signed a brief order dismissing the case ``with
prejudice,'' which means that McCloskey is legally the victor in
the dispute.
   ``This is a confirmation of my integrity,'' McCloskey said in a
telephone interview from his home in San Francisco. ``I don't like
at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over the
United States. He is admitting that he is the one who is the liar.''
   Robertson accepted the court-costs condition in a one-sentence
letter from his attorney, Douglas V. Rigler, that was delivered to
the judge's chambers by messenger.
   McCloskey said, ``The court's service was to unmask this man as
the fraud he is.''
   But Robertson, in a campaign appearance in Wichita Falls, Texas,
said the judge ``gave me what I consider a real victory.''
   ``She denied him any court costs _ any damages, I should say. He
asked for $400,000. And I have the privilege of suing him once the
primary is over,'' he said.
   However, in an opinion issued last week, Green quoted _ and
underlined _ a passage from a 1985 federal appeals court opinion
that stated: ``Dismissal of an action with prejudice is a complete
adjudication of the issues presented by the pleadings and is a bar
to further action between the parties.''
   McCloskey's attorney George Lehner said he understood that this
citation means his client cannot be sued again over any statements
he makes about Robertson's war record.
   ``It's an absolute dead letter,'' Lehner said. ``I assume he can
bring suit if Pete says something else, but not about this whole
Korean business.''
   Under terms of the dismissal, Robertson must pay court fees,
printing costs and court reporters' fees, but not McCloskey's
attorney's fees, estimated at $400,000.
   The judge gave McCloskey's lawyers 20 days to file an itemized
list of court costs to be assessed against Robertson. Those costs
could range between $5,000 and $20,000, depending on conflicting
estimates given by lawyers for both sides.
   If Robertson had rejected Green's dismissal, he would have had
to go to court on Tuesday to begin the trial, which was expected to
last about three weeks.
   ``The judge gave me an impossible dilemma,'' Robertson said on
Sunday, ``the choice of either defending my honor on Tuesday or
being president and running for president.''
   The suit stems from McCloskey's allegation that Robertson used
the political influence of his late father, Sen. A. Willis
Robertson, D-Va., to avoid combat in the Korean War.
   The former television evangelist filed the lawsuit in 1986.
Several former Marines later came forward to support McCloskey's
allegation.
   McCloskey said Monday he is setting up a legal defense fund
hoping to raise money to pay for the attorneys' fees.

   Dennis Banks, a former leader of the
American Indian Movement, was sentenced today to five years'
probation for illegally possessing dynamite.
   Banks, 50, of South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,
pleaded guilty to the charge in exchange for dismissal of all other
charges remaining against him and three other defendants in the
12-year-old case.
   Trial had been scheduled to begin here next month, following
years of legal sparring that included numerous appeals to the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Banks, his wife KaMook, Russ James Redner and Kenneth Moses Loud
Hawk, all American Indians, were charged with possessing eight guns
with obliterated serial numbers and 350 pounds of unregistered
dynamite.
   The weapons and explosives allegedly were found when Oregon
State Police stopped a motor home and a station wagon near Ontario,
just west of the Oregon-Idaho border, on Nov. 14, 1975.
   KaMook Banks, Redner and Loud Hawk were arrested at the scene.
Authorities said Banks and another man, Leonard Peltier, escaped on
foot. Prosecutors said Banks' fingerprints were found in the motor
home, which was owned by actor Marlon Brando.
   Peltier later was convicted in the June 1975 gunshot slayings of
two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Reservation. He is serving two
life sentences in a federal prison at Leavenworth, Kan.
   A gun belonging to one of the slain FBI agents was found in the
vehicles that were stopped in Oregon, authorities said. They said
the vehicles were en route from the Puget Sound area of Washington
to the Pine Ridge Reservation.
   Banks was a leader of the American Indian Movement, formed in
the 1960s to support Indian rights. In 1973, he and other AIM
members staged a 10-week siege at Wounded Knee, S.D., to protest
treatment of Indians in the United States.

   The new president of Gallaudet
University said Monday she empathizes with students and faculty at
the all-deaf university who are protesting her appointment because
she hears.
   ``I do feel very deeply a sense of compassion and empathy,''
Elizabeth Zinser said Monday in a telephone interview. ``I know
it's hurting them because they very much wanted their seventh
president to be deaf.
   ``But I think that what the students are expressing in general
is their deep concern and care for the university. I hope that they
and I ... as soon things quiet down can begin to focus on the work
of Gallaudet University.''
   Hundreds of students shut down Gallaudet, the nation's only
university for the deaf, out of anger Monday over the selection of
a president who is not hearing-impaired.
   Zinser said she would probably begin her new job this summer.
Meanwhile, she will begin an intensive program to learn sign
language and hopes to volunteer with agencies that work with the
deaf, she said.
   Zinser, vice chancellor of Academic Affairs at the University of
North Carolina at Greensboro since 1983, was named Gallaudet
president Sunday by the school's Board of Trustees.
   Zinser said she was concerned about the student protests but not
about what impact it might have on her presidency.
   ``I think it would be inhuman on my part not to be concerned,''
she said. ``But my concern is for the pain that I know some
individuals are feeling. I do, however, believe that the board has
made its decision.''
   ``The university belongs to a large and varied constitutency of
which the president is a symbol,'' she said. ``I am not, perhaps to
some, the best symbol.
   ``I know that I cannot fully understand the experience of
deafness without being deaf. ... But I will become as knowledgable
and as understanding and as empathetic as anyone can who's a
hearing person.''
   Zinser holds a doctorate in educational psychology from the
University of California at Berkeley. Before coming to North
Carolina in 1983, she was a professor, dean of the school of
nursing and senior academic officer at the University of North
Dakota at Grand Forks.

<HEAD>Soviets Call On Iran, Iraq to End `War of the Cities'

<TEXT>
   The Soviet ambassador to the United
Nations on Monday urged Iran and Iraq to stop bombarding each
other's capitals and said the escalating ``war of the cities'' was
a major development in the war.
   ``We think that the war between cities adds some new dimension
to the protracted military conflict between the two neighboring
countries,'' Soviet Ambassador Aleksander Belonogov said.
   Belonogov made his statements in an unusual news conference
outside the U.N. Security Council, which later met behind closed
doors on the Iran-Iraq conflict.
   Last July, the Security Council demanded an immediate cease-fire
in the 7{-year-old war. The United States is now pushing for an
arms embargo against Iran for rebuffing the resolution, but the
Soviets have balked at an embargo.
   Belonogov said he met Monday with Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar and with the president of the Security Council this
month, Yugoslav Ambassador Dragoslav Pejic, and urged them ``in the
most energetic terms'' to try to persuade Iran and Iraq to stop the
missile attacks.
   ``It is difficult to say what political and psychological
consequences the war of the cities may result in,'' Belonogov said.
   ``The position of my country is clear. We are for the soonest
possible political resolution of the conflict between Iran and Iraq
and for the speediest possible implementation of the'' cease-fire
resolution.
   Belonogov was also asked whether his country believes Iran now
accepts the cease-fire resolution, as it seemed to claim in an
ambiguous unsigned note to the council last week.
   ``We don't think that it would be right just to disregard the
new developments in the situation,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.
   The unsigned note from Iran claimed that a Feb. 28 letter from
its foreign minister constituted acceptance of the resolution. The
letter, however, did not say that Iran endorsed the resolution.
   British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell on Monday called the
letter ``an undated, unsigned scrap of paper.''
   ``Where does that leave us?'' he said. ``It does not constitute
a clear acceptance.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington
Monday that the United States doesn't accept the unsigned note
either and will keep pushing for an arms embargo on Iran.
   Each of the five permanent members of the Security Council _ the
Soviet Union, China, France, Britain and the United States _ has
the power to veto an embargo resolution.
   The Soviets are close allies of Iraq but have also been trying
to improve relations with neighboring Iran. Both Iran and Iraq are
believed to be using Soviet-made missiles in the ``war of the
cities.''
   Belonogov denied that what he called ``the defensive weapons now
used against Tehran and other cities'' are Soviet-made.

   Hundreds of experts from around the
globe gather in antebellum Charleston this week to seek ways to
make the world's cities better places to live.
   The 4th International Conference on Making Cities Liveable,
which opens Wednesday, is being held in the United States for the
first time.
   ``The quality of life in our cities has become increasingly a
national concern,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Monday.
   Riley said Charleston boasts many ``important national, if not
international, examples of the liveability of cities,'' from its
preservation efforts to its innovative programs of low-income
housing to the acclaimed Spoleto arts festival.
   ``But we have so much to learn,'' he said.
   ``It's a conference for people who are concerned about the
quality of life in the city'' but isn't a professional conference,
said Suzanne Lennard, one of the organizers and a founder of the
Center for Urban Well-Being.
   ``It brings together many different kinds of people. It brings
together city planners and architects, city council presidents and
mayors and citizens who are simply concerned about making their
cities more liveable,'' she said.
   More than 300 people are expected to attend and more than 100
people are scheduled to speak. Among the topics of discussion will
be the design of public spaces, festivals, the role of markets in
the city and a number of case studies.
   The Center for Urban Well-Being, based in Southhampton, N.Y., is
a partnership that conducts research, publishes and works with
cities on urban issues.
   The first three international conferences were held in Venice.
``We wanted to bring it to America to make it more accessible for
Americans,'' Mrs. Lennard said.
   One of the topics of discussion will be public art _ sculptures
and other art in public places such as parks.
   Sculptor Bonifatius Stirnberg, who has crafted numerous,
whimsical, human-sized sculptures for parks and fountains
throughout Europe, will talk about his craft.
   Usually crafted of bronze, his works are often designed for a
particular town and tell something about its history or folklore.
They include a sculpture of carnival characters on a barge that's
part of a fountain and a long bronze sea serpent whose tail serves
as a park bench.
   Stirnberg, of Aachen, West Germany, said through an interpreter,
``The goal of my work is to make sculpture that is loved by the
people _ that people can move and touch.''
   In contrast, Riley said, ``in America we see so much public art
that is not of a human scale.''
   Riley said ``the power of a meeting like this is in the
learning, teaching and sharing. It has the potential of improving
the quality of life in cities all over America and beyond.''

   A 15-year-old girl who was acting out a
scene from the movie ``Stand By Me'' was struck and killed when she
misjudged the speed of an oncoming train and stepped into its path,
authorities said Monday.
   The accident Sunday in suburban Fairport occurred behind the
American National Can Co., said Fairport Police Chief Joseph D.
Picciotti.
   Kimberly Anne Strassner and three friends were singing the
movie's title song and recreating the scenes in which four boys
artfully dodge trains, Picciotti said.
   ``They actually heard the engineer (whistle) and felt the rumble
of the track,'' said Picciotti, who interviewed one of the friends
Monday. ``The victim for some unknown reason challenged the train
and lost.''
   The 105-car Conrail train was heading east when the conductor
spotted the youths and blew a caution whistle, Monroe County
sheriff's deputies said.
   Miss Strassner and her girlfriend were standing between two sets
of tracks as the train approached. At the last moment, she leaped
into the train's path and was struck and thrown 50 feet, Picciotti
said.
   Miss Strassner's mother, Patricia Sampson, said ``Stand By Me''
was her daughter's favorite movie.
   ``She watched it over and over again. And she had a crush on the
actor. She bought the video and she went to any friend who had a
VCR and watched it,'' her mother said.

   No order is too tall for Richlee Shoes,
which specializes in elevator shoes.
   It even sells elevator bedroom slippers.
   ``If you're going to be taller at the office and the company
picnic, why wouldn't you want to be taller at home? Won't the
neighbors notice if you run out to get the paper that you're
shorter?'' said Bob Martin, who operates the company with his
sister and three brothers.
   Ninety styles, priced $40 to $120, are displayed in 100,000
square feet of warehouse space just south of Frederick. It sells
direct and through mail order.
   ``We don't feel we've even scratched the surface'' of the number
of men who want to appear taller, said Martin. ``Depending on the
style, our shoes can make a man two inches taller. I've had people
call me up ... they say `the difference in my height has made a
difference in my social life.'''
   Elevator shoes have come a long way from the days when the
company's celebrity spokesman, Mickey Rooney, sported oxfords with
chunky heels that didn't hide their purpose. Today's elevator shoes
look like normal shoes but have a built-up insole.
   Martin said he even has one regular customer who stands 6-foot-5.
   ``I asked him why,'' he said. ``He said he was a basketball
player in college and all his friends were 6-feet-7 or 8.''

   A self-cleaning bathtub and salt dyed red
so that people can know how much they use. Sunglasses with pockets
and a life-preserver for horses.
   Those are inventions by kids involved in a program called Invent
America, which seeks to boost the level of creativity and
innovation in this country.
   At Dommerich Elementary School in this Orlando suburb,
fifth-graders are brainstorming their way to new ideas to resolve
problems, such as locating a dog at night or taking out the garbage.
   The Invent America class is taught by Gil Rowe one day a week to
each of five classes of gifted students in different grades. He
came from Ocoee Elementary School, which won four of Invent
America's nine state awards, the most of any school in the country.
   ``We've just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old
American ingenuity,'' says Rowe, 44. The program was started by the
privately funded U.S. Patent Model Foundation in Washington.
   Besides opening up the innovative process, Rowe says, the
program enhances students' self-esteem. One Ocoee second-grader who
was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented
a device that earned him his classmates' admiration.
   ``Suddenly he became a famous inventor. He just became a totally
different individual,'' Rowe said.
   The problem of finding a dog at night was addressed by
11-year-old Seth Swanson, who plans to develop a dog collar with a
light attached before the class ends with a school fair in April.
   Ten-year-old Robbie Cadle hates carrying the garbage cans out so
much that he concentrated all his efforts on that one issue.
   His solution? Motorized garbage cans that can be driven from the
house to the street, and back.

   The sex experts Dr. William Masters and Virginia
Johnson said Monday they could not provide scientific evidence to
support their widely publicized claim that AIDS is ``running
rampant'' among heterosexuals.
   When Masters was asked at a contentious news conference how he
could justify such a claim, he said, ``I simply believe this.''
Johnson, asked the same question, said ``I'm not sure we chose the
word `rampant' ourselves.''
   On page seven of their new book, they write: ``The AIDS virus is
now running rampant in the heterosexual community.''
   The book, ``Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior in the Age of AIDS,''
was made available to reporters Monday morning. The first reports
of its contents appeared in connection with an excerpt from the
book published in this week's Newsweek magazine.
   ``We don't see an explosion into the heterosexual community,''
said Dr. Peter Fischinger, AIDS coordinator for the Public Health
Service. ``This does not mean we can be complacent about it.'' He
noted that nationwide screening of blood donors has found that only
about one in 40,000 has the potential of being infected with the
AIDS virus.
   ``The Public Health Service has been working very hard to try to
get the best sense of prevalence of HIV infection in the United
States,'' Fischinger said. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is
the virus that causes AIDS.
   Dr. Stephen Joseph, New York City's health commissioner, said of
the Masters and Johnson study, ``All in all, I think it's greatly
overblown.'' He criticized them for not submitting their data to a
scientific journal where it could be reviewed in detail by other
researchers, and he said their data did not support the sweeping
claims they made.
   ``I think everyone would agree there is a serious danger in
heterosexual transmission,'' he said. But ``contrary to what they
say, I think the Public Health Service people have been saying that
for a long time.''
   Masters and Johnson and Dr. Robert Kolodny, their co-author and
a director of the Masters & Johnson Institute in St. Louis, studied
800 men and women in Atlanta, St. Louis, New York and Los Angeles.
   The study, the centerpiece of their book, included only people
who said they did not use illicit intravenous drugs and said they
had had no homosexual or bisexual contact and no blood transfusions
since 1977.
   Masters, Johnson and Kolodny chose four hundred men and women
who said they had had at least six sexual partners each year for
the preceding five years, and another 400 who said they had been
monogamous.
   The researchers found that 5 percent of the sexually active men
and 7 percent of the sexually active women had antibodies to the
AIDS virus, meaning they had been exposed to it.
   The researchers said, however, that these findings could not be
used to project how many people in the United States might be
infected with the AIDS virus. ``This is not meant to be _ it was
not constructed as _ a broad representative sample of the
population,'' said Kolodny.
   Kolodny said the claim that AIDS is rampant among heterosexuals
comes from studies by other researchers. But other studies have
diverged widely on the question of how rapidly AIDS is entering the
non-drug-using heterosexual community.
   In October, for example, Dr. Thomas Quinn of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore studied men and women visiting a sexually
transmitted-diseases clinic in Baltimore and found that one-third
of the men infected with the AIDS virus and almost half of the
women got the infection through heterosexual contact.
   That was one of the highest reported rates of spread among
heterosexuals. At the same scientific meeting, however, researchers
from New York City and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
reported that only one in 205 men coming to a sexually
transmitted-diseases clinic in New York City was infected with AIDS
in the absence of drug use, homosexuality or other high-risk
behavior.

<HEAD>Bush Looks for Southern Sweep, Possible Dole Defeat in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, anticipating a
Super Tuesday windfall of Republican convention delegates, is
targeting Illinois, the biggest state in Bob Dole's Midwest base,
as the battleground that could end the Kansas senator's hope of a
comeback in the GOP race.
   ``I don't know what Dole does if he doesn't win Illinois,'' said
Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater.
   ``I can't wait to hear their new theory if they lose Illinois,''
he said. ``Everyone comes up with a theory on how they can still
win it.''
   A Dole campaign source agreed the Kansas senator must win
Illinois and said they would spend about $500,000 on television
advertising, their largest budget for any state.
   Rich Bond, Bush's deputy campaign manager, refused to cite a
specific figure for the campaign's advertising budget but said they
would spent ``whatever it takes.''
   Traveling with Bush in Missouri on Monday, Atwater said he
expected the vice president to win 12 or 13 of the 17 GOP events on
Tuesday.
   Asked he was hoping for a clean sweep, Bush said, ``You always
wish for that, but I certainly would never predict that. It's too
much for anyone to expect.''
   While Bush aides speculate about a possible Super Tuesday sweep
that could net the vice president up to 600 GOP convention
delegates, the Dole camp talks about surviving the South and
getting back to the Midwest, where the Kansas senator has whipped
Bush in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota.
   ``Dole is undefeated in the Midwest and Illinois is in the
Midwest,'' said Dole campaign aide Larry McCarthy.
   ``The key is how well we do in the Midwestern tier of states,
starting with Illinois,'' said Richard Wirthlin, Dole's pollster.
   But Bond disputed the Dole homeground advantage in Illinois.
   ``The votes aren't in Bob Dole's backyard,'' he said. ``The
votes are in Chicago and the collar counties (the Chicago suburbs)
and it's hardly a typical farm state.''
   With 82 GOP delegates at stake, the Illinois primary is March
15, one week after Super Tuesday.
   Dole has already started his television campaign in Illinois
with a biographical ad that emphasizes his humble upbringing, war
service, and leadership role in Congress.
   ``Dole turned Ronald Reagan's vision into an action plan for
America,'' said the ad, which concluded with the narrator saying,
``Bob Dole is a strong man _ with a record of solving tough
problems.''
   Dole has a strong organization in the state, headed by Illinois
House minority leader Lee Daniels and augmented by former Gov.
Richard Ogilvie.
   Backing Bush was Gov. James Thompson, as well as 93 of the
state's 102 Republican county chairmen.
   While the Dole campaign cited Illinois as the staging ground for
a comeback, Bush aides called the state important but not essential.
   ``If for some reason George Bush can't win Illinois, I still
suspect he's going to be the nominee of the Republican Party,''
said Atwater.
   The Bush campaign aide cited the key role the state has played
in past presidential nomination races.
   ``In my mind, Ronald Reagan was going to be the nominee when we
won Illinois in 1980,'' he said. ``In my mind when Mondale won
Illinois in 1984, he was going to be the nominee.''
   Atwater and Bond contended that the election calendar also is a
problem for Dole.
   They cited the fact that among the key states that follow
Illinois are Connecticut, where Bush has a big advantage, and New
York, where the vice president is the only candidate to have
delegate slates filed in every congressional district.
   ``We get 45 delegates just for showing up,'' said Bond.
   ``Even winning a state or two,'' added Bond, ``I don't see how
he (Dole) gets the upper hand. ... Can he win a state or two? Sure.
Can he stop Bush? I don't think so.''

<HEAD>Reagan Again Calls for Contra Military Aid, But Wright Cool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan renewed his call Monday for
weapons for the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government, but
House Speaker Jim Wright gave the request an icy reception.
   In a speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, Reagan
said his congressional opponents on the issue of aid to the Contra
rebels lack courage to fight communism, and said efforts to renew
``humanitarian'' aid for the rebels are insufficient.
   ``Now it's time for Congress to show that it knows you can't
have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships
and the other has bandages,'' Reagan told the group.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said later that the
administration still hopes Wright will come up with a new Contra
aid proposal and that the White House will be encouraging efforts
in the Senate to write an aid bill.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that ``time is a problem. ... We don't
know how long (the Contras) can last.'' U.S. aid to the rebels
ended a week ago.
   But on Capitol Hill, where the House last week narrowly defeated
an effort to send food and clothing to the Contras, Wright said it
is time to turn to other issues.
   ``There is a weariness with the Contra issue'' among House
members, said Wright, D-Texas. He added that he plans to begin
mapping out a program of other legislation to bring to the floor,
including issues like welfare reform and a health-care bill.
   Wright also signaled that a group of senators trying to revive
some kind of Contra aid bill could run into procedural roadblocks,
reminding reporters obliquely that the House traditionally reserves
the right to originate any legislation to appropriate money.
   ``I'm not looking for problems'' with a Senate-originated bill,
he said, but added: ``Those who draft the legislation ought to be
mindful of that.''
   Wright said last week's defeat of the Democratic $30.8 million
Contra aid package means that the United States is left with little
more than moral suasion as a tool to influence Central American
peace efforts.
   ``It just throws it into the hands of the Central Americans
entirely, and sort of withdraws the United States for the moment
from having any direct influence,'' he said.
   Wright said he has sent telegrams to both sides in the conflict,
urging them to pursue a cease-fire agreement when they meet this
week for the first time without a mediator and inside Nicaragua.
   He said he urged the Sandinista side to permit a role for
Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, whom Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega has rejected as a mediator after several
fruitless sessions. And he asked the rebels to go forward with the
talks, noting that they had been granted the high-level direct
talks they have been seeking.
   In his speech, Reagan said the defeat of the Contras would mean
a ``grave strategic defeat for the United States.''
   ``The communists in Central America understand this, the Soviets
understand this _ it's time that Congress understood it too,''
Reagan said. ``A Soviet base on the American mainland is a pistol
pointed at the heart of the Americas.''
   Reagan contended that the ``real issue'' before the Congress is
not the Contras, ``it is communism in Central America.''
   Referring to last week's 216-to-208 vote, Reagan said: ``Courage
hasn't exactly been the watchword of some opponents of Contra aid.
... Last week, aid opponents tried to pass the buck of
responsibility for abandoning in the field the young men and women
of the Democratic resistance, and that ploy failed as it should
have.''

<HEAD>Court To Decide Case On Disqualifying Black Potential Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether a criminal defendant's right to a jury selected from a
cross-section of the community is violated when prosecutors
disqualify potential jurors because they are black.
   The court will review the case of Frank D. Teague, sentenced to
30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago supermarket
and for the attempted murder of police officers shot at after the
robbery.
   The justices in 1986 ruled in a case called Batson vs. Kentucky
that prosecutors never may disqualify potential jurors based on
their race. The court said such tactics violate equal-protection
rights.
   But a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive
effect of the Batson ruling.
   The court said the Batson decision does not apply to convicted
criminals who, like Teague, had exhausted direct appeals in state
courts prior to April 30, 1986, when Batson was announced.
   If the justices were to rule that the prosecutorial tactics used
at Teague's trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to
cross-sectional jury selection, he would be entitled to a new trial
even though the Batson ruling came too late to help him.
   Presumably, such a ruling would affect other prison inmates'
convictions as well.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last May that past
Supreme Court decisions make clear that ``the fair cross-section
requirement of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the jury
itself'' but only to the pool of potential jurors from which juries
are chosen.
   Lawyers for Teague, who is black, contend that his fair-trial
rights were violated when prosecutors used all 10 of their
so-called peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury.
   The court's decision is not expected until sometime in 1989.

   Presidential candidates sent out their last
wave of commercials in Super Tuesday states on Monday, and
Republican Bob Dole was already appealing to TV viewers in the next
battleground.
   Dole was running ads in 11 states, including Illinois, which
holds its primary next Tuesday.
   In Illinois, the Kansas senator started running a spot called
``Strong Man'' that stresses the poverty and war wounds Dole
overcame in rising to his present post of Senate GOP leader. The ad
says Dole ``turned Ronald Reagan's vision into an action plan for
America. Tax cuts, aid for the Contras, fighting wasteful
spending.''
   Dole was running a mix of ads _ including an attack on Vice
President George Bush's Iran-Contra role _ in Illinois, Alabama,
Maryland, Gorgia, Louisiana, Washington, Oklahoma, North Carolina,
Missouri, Arkansas and Florida.
   Bush was expected to trounce Dole in the Super Tuesday arena and
planned ``the heaviest media buy we'll place anywhere in this
campaign'' in Illinois, according to aide Rich Bond.
   Bush has been endorsed by Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson and most of
the state's county Republican chairmen.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr, D-Tenn., was running a mix of seven TV
spots in 13 Southern and border states. Four of the ads were
head-on criticism of rival Democrats while the other three stressed
populist, anti-establishment themes.
   Gore planned to split his time between Illinois and South
Carolina until the Saturday primary in South Carolina, and then
return to Illinois until next Tuesday's primary there.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has been endorsed by powerful Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago and expects to spend parts of Thursday
and Friday in Illinois. Spokeswoman Lisa Cutter said Gephardt was
not advertising in Illinois as of Monday.
   The congressman was running a mix of five television spots in
eight Super Tuesday states: Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas,
Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia. Among them were
endorsements by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., and Marvin Leath,
D-Texas, his famous trade ad about the $48,000 K-Car, and two
attacks on Michael Dukakis.
   Two Democratic native sons, Jesse Jackson and Sen. Paul Simon,
planned no television advertising in their home state of Illinois.
   ``We're planning to run a barnstorming campaign around the
state'' counting on news coverage, said Simon press secretary Terry
Michael.
   Simon skipped Super Tuesday, saying he couldn't afford it and it
would be inconclusive. Jackson ran a modest, upbeat TV campaign to
augment a full schedule of personal appearances.

<TEXT>
   The United States would welcome participation
by North Korean athletes in the Seoul Olympics, a senior U.S.
diplomat said Monday.
   ``The Olympics would be better off if North Korea chooses to
participate,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Edward Derwinski.
``But time is running out.''
   He added that ``we have nothing but a positive attitude'' toward
participation by Pyongyang.
   Derwinski said the United States will have ``some additional
naval units'' in the region at the time of the September Olympic
Games. Speaking at the U.S. Information Agency's Foreign Press
Center, he said the additional naval presence was ``a very timely,
practical coincidence.''
   Other U.S. officials have said the additional presence will
probably consist of one or two aircraft carriers.
   Derwinski warned that any attempt by the North Koreans to
disrupt the games ``would make them a total pariah.'' North Korea
is one of only a handful of countries, including Cuba, which is
boycotting the games.
   Derwinski indicated that the United States would ask visiting
Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian to use his country's leverage
with North Korea to prevent any disruption of the Olympics.
   ``This is the logical, diplomatic way to proceed'' with the
Pyongyang government, he said. ``We have no leverage with them, and
any suggestion on our part would be counterproductive.''

<HEAD>January Marks Biggest Debt Increase In Four Months</HEAD>

   Americans took out $5.42 billion more in
installment debt than they paid off in January, the biggest monthly
increase in four months and the second strong month in a row, the
government said Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit grew at a seasonally
adjusted rate of 10.6 percent in January, following an increase of
$3.98 billion in December, which translated to an annual rate of
7.9 percent.
   Growth in both months was greater than the 5.9 percent rate for
all of 1987, which represents a considerable slowdown compared with
recent years. The rate was 10.5 percent in 1986.
   The relatively strong January report is both a reflection of job
growth _ unemployment hit a nine-year low of 5.7 percent in
February _ and a sign that the rebound in consumer confidence after
the October stock market crash is continuing, according to David
Cross, an economist with The Futures Group, a Washington consulting
firm.
   ``What we're seeing right now ... is a sort of soft landing for
consumer spending,'' said Cross, whose firm is predicting growth
between 6.5 percent and 7 percent this year. ``We're not really
looking for a recession to occur, if anything just a bit of
slowness in the first half of the year.''
   The January increase was the biggest advance since debt rose by
$6.43 billion in September. The gains in both months were strongly
influenced by an upturn in car sales.
   Auto loans rose by $1.54 billion in January, an annual rate of
7.1 percent, and followed a stronger gain of 10.7 percent in
December.
   Credit card and revolving loans grew by $2.0 billion in January,
a 16.5 percent annual rate, following an increase of 19.3 percent a
month earlier.
   The debt category which includes bank and credit union loans not
secured by real estate grew by $1.73 billion, an 11.6 percent
growth rate, following a decline of 3.5 percent in December.
   Loans for mobile homes increased $142 million after falling $122
million in December.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at $617.5 billion
in January.

   Rescuers using trained dogs found the body
of a cross-country skier buried in an avalanche in Mount Rainer
National Park, a park spokesman said Monday.
   Pamela Benton Lee, 28, of Olympia, was buried Sunday afternoon
in the Plummer Peak area, 5,000 to 6,000 feet in elevation,
spokesman Dave Uberuaga said.
   Her companion, Sean Mehan of Olympia, told rangers he probed
unsuccessfully in the snow for about an hour before skiing out and
notifying park rangers, Uberuaga said.
   Mehan, with two rangers and two climbers, tried to get to the
site late Sunday, but had to turn back because of darkness and
avalanche hazard, Uberuaga said.
   On Monday, a team of 11 park staff, 10 members of the area
mountain-rescue council and three dog units began probing the
avalanche, Uberuaga said. An initial shoulder-to-shoulder sweep of
the avalanche failed to fine Ms. Lee, he said.
   A dog that sensed a ``hot spot'' found the body buried near the
base of the avalanche, Uberuaga said. Rescuers used probes to
pinpoint the body and dig it out. Ms. Lee had been missing about 20
hours.
   The avalanche, about 60 feet wide and 120 feet long, ranged in
depth from 2 feet to 10 feet, Uberuaga said.
   A high avalanche hazard was posted all day Sunday, after
Paradise received 10 inches of snow Saturday, bringing the total
there to 130 inches. Avalanche hazard was still considered high on
Monday.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Buys More US Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of
corn would be about 11.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.85 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of
around $22 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 3.17
million tons of corn, plus almost 6.9 million tons of wheat;
813,300 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt emphasized his
support for an oil-import fee on Monday, one day before four
oil-producing states vote on Super Tuesday, then went to the Alamo
to call himself the Democratic candidate for economic independence.
   ``We're standing today in front of the Alamo, a place where
there was a fight for independence,'' Gephardt said. ``This
election in 1988 is a fight again for the independence of America,
the fight for us to regain control of our economic destiny.''
   Gephardt spoke to about 400 supporters and tourists in this
city, generally considered a stronghold for Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, after speaking at a struggling Dallas plant that
makes equipment for the oil industry.
   Dukakis was at the Alamo Sunday. Many of the Democrats here are
Hispanic, and Dukakis spoke to them in fluent Spanish.
   But Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, supporting Gephardt, told
the rally on Monday that no one suffers more from the oil
industry's downturn than South Texas Hispanics.
   ``If you want somebody who speaks Spanish, I do a little of that
and I can interpret for Dick,'' Bustamante said, noting that
Gephardt has begun studying Spanish. San Antonio Mayor Henry
Cisneros has stayed neutral, although his wife has endorsed Dukakis.
   Gephardt recalled he trained for the Missouri Air National Guard
at Lackland Air Force Base near here. He then attacked Dukakis for
wanting to cut the defense budget.
   ``He's going to leave us in jeopardy and vulnerable,'' Gephardt
said.
   He continued to criticize his foes for opposing an oil-import
fee.
   ``Anyone like Al Gore or Michael Dukakis who tells you that
they're for making America energy independent is simply trying to
deceive you in a shameful way,'' Gephardt said after touring
Dresser Industries, a Dallas plant that Gephardt said shows the
need for long-term domestic energy policy because of its nearly 50
percent cutbacks in operation.
   Gephardt has concentrated on Gore and Dukakis in his Texas
swing. Polls indicate he and Gore are battling for third behind
Dukakis and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. But Gephardt said
his chances for winning Texas were good.

<HEAD>Security Council Draft Calls For Economic Sanctions Against South
Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Security Council draft resolution
circulated Monday calls for mandatory economic sanctions, including
an oil embargo, against South Africa to force the government to
abolish apartheid within a year.
   The draft resolution, to be discussed when the council meets
Tuesday, expresses outrage at the banning of anti-apartheid
activities and concern for the ``worsening of the human suffering
resulting from the apartheid system'' of racial segregation.
   The resolution says South Africa's intransigence ``compels the
international community to impose, as a first step, selective
mandatory sanctions.''
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the 26 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control
the economy and maintain separate schools and districts.
   The resolution, circulated after three days of debate, calls for
a halt to export and sale of oil to South Africa; an end to further
investment and loans; a ban on imports of iron and steel; a halt of
all trade promotion and support for trade; prohibition of sale of
Kruggerands and all coins minted in South Africa; and cessation of
all forms of military, policy or intelligence cooperation,
especially the sale of computer equipment.
   South African U.N. Ambassador Leslie Manley told the Security
Council on Thursday, ``We will not bow to your threats or demands
and we reject your accusations with contempt and invite you to do
your damnedest.''
   The resolution calls for all U.N. members to back the sanctions
and report progress to the secretary-general. It establishes a
Security Council committee to monitor implementation.
   Security Council resolutions can be vetoed by any one of its
permanent members _ the United States, Great Britain, China, France
and the Soviet Union. The Council and the U.N. General Assembly
have condemned South Africa in the past, but the United States and
other countries have opposed sanctions.
   The resolution says the sanctions would remain in force for one
year, after which the council again will meet to determine if South
Africa has abolished apartheid.
   The proposed measures also require South Africa to lift the ban
on anti-apartheid political activities, release all political
prisoners, allow the free and safe return of exiles and commence
dialogue with leaders of the majority black population.
   The draft resolution was submitted by Algeria, Argentina, Nepal,
Senegal, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

<HEAD>High Court To Rule Whether Stereotyping Denied Woman Partnership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday set the stage for
an important ruling on sex discrimination, agreeing to study a case
in which ``unconscious stereotyping'' allegedly played a key role
in denying a woman an accounting firm partnership.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that places a heavy
burden on employers to disprove sex bias.
   Arguments in the case will be heard in the fall during the
court's next term and a decision is not likely to be announced
until 1989.
   Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's largest accounting firms,
is accused of discriminating unlawfully against Ann Hopkins. She
quit the firm's office here after she was denied promotion to
partnership, a move that would have made her a part owner.
   Ms. Hopkins joined the firm in 1978 and was nominated for
partnership in 1982, the only woman among 88 candidates for
partnership that year.
   She had been very successful in getting business for the
company, winning government contracts worth an estimated $34
million to $44 million.
   Of the 88 candidates, 47 were invited to become partners; 21
were rejected outright; and 20 including Ms. Hopkins were placed on
hold.
   The following year she was told she would not become a partner,
and she resigned in 1984 to set up her own consulting firm.
   Both her critics and supporters at Price Waterhouse said she
sometimes was overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her
staff and very demanding.
   One critic suggested she needed to take a ``course at charm
school.''
   A partner in the firm who urged her promotion told her she would
stand a better chance of becoming a partner if she would ``walk
more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear
make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.''
   Others said her use of profanity was a black mark against her.
   Ms. Hopkins then sued Price Waterhouse, accusing the company of
violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting
on-the-job sex disscrimination. She said that sex stereotyping,
unconscious or otherwise, barred her from being named partner.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1984, in the case of a woman denied
partnership in a law firm, that professional partnerships are
covered by the 1964 law.
   A federal judge ruled Price Waterhouse must prove ``by clear and
convincing evidence'' it would not have made her a partner
regardless of whether sexual stereotyping played a part in its
decision.
   Price Waterhouse said it was unable to provide such proof.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last August said there is
``competent evidence that ... the partnership selection process at
Price Waterhouse was impermissibly infected by stereotypical
attitudes toward female candidates.''
   The appeals court said even if there is evidence that Ms.
Hopkins' personality played a part in her denial of partnership,
Price Waterhouse is unable to prove ``impermissible bias was not
the determinative factor.''
   The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what
back pay and other remedies the company must provide.
   The case is Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins, 87-1167.

   President Zia Ul-Haq of Pakistan was quoted Monday
as saying he's certain of signing an Afghan peace accord soon, even
though his representative continued to press for an interim
government to oversee withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Pakistan's chief representative in the peace talks, acting
Foreign Minister Zain Noorani, said Islamabad was still hoping for
Soviet cooperation, even though his country wants an interim
government to replace the present Moscow-backed regime.
   ``It is in their interest, too, to see that there is peace and
calm after they leave,'' said Noorani after talks resumed Monday
morning following a weekend recess.
   However, Zia was quoted as telling the Gulf News, a United Arab
Emirates newspaper, that ``there is no question of the accord not
going through.'' ``Allowing it to be dropped is no option,'' he
said.
   The talks adjourned so Pakistani government and opposition
leaders could discuss whether they're ready to sign an accord with
the Soviet-backed Afghan government of President Najib.
   Pakistan represents Afghan rebels in the talks and does not
recognize the Kabul government.
   Noorani declined to say what Pakistan had decided over the
weekend.
   No afternoon session was scheduled following the morning
meetings conducted separately by U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez with
the Afghan and Pakistani delegations. Asked whether there was any
progress, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said only, ``Ask Mr.
Cordovez.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has named March 15 as the
deadline for signing a settlement if the pullout of 115,000 Soviet
troops is to begin in mid-May, before a U.S.-Soviet summit.
   Agreement was reached Thursday on a withdrawal over nine months
in which half of the troops would leave within 90 days.
   A spokesman for the largest group in the seven-party Afghan
rebel alliance said Monday that progress was being made in setting
up an Islamic government with headquarters possibly in Afghanistan.
Professor Abdul Kadir Kariab, in charge of political affairs of the
fundamentalist Hezb-I-Islami party, said a U.S-educated engineer,
Ahmed Shah, had already been unanimously elected head of state.
   Kariab also told reporters in Geneva that the alliance was
already in contact with Pakistan, Iran and other countries
regarding possible recognition of the future government.
   The alliance claims to represent 200,000 rebels and to control
80 percent of the Afghan territory.
   Kariab also repeated charges raised by the chairman of his
party, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, that the United States and the Soviet
Union had struck a ``secret deal'' to prevent formation of such a
government. He said a ``Jewish lobby'' was part of such
``conspiracy'' because it feared Islamic fundamentalism.
   He said that if Pakistan were pressed to sign ``a settlement in
the present shape, (it) will be historic treason to the Afghan
people.''

   A South African diplomat was cited
for assault Monday after his car struck a protester and a police
officer outside a radio station where he had been interviewed,
police said.
   South African Vice Consul Duke Kent Brown was arrested about a
quarter-mile away after allegedly fleeing the scene, Police Chief
John Race said.
   Brown was charged with simple assault, released on his own
recognizance and ordered to appear in court in April. The charge
carries up to a year in prison and a fine of $1,000, Race said.
   Brown left the Burlington area following his release, police
said, and he failed to make three other scheduled appearances with
the media.
   Jim Condon, news director at radio station WJOY-WQCR and a
witness, said the protester who was struck suffered minor bruises.
   Race identified the injured officer as Todd Shepard, said he had
suffered leg bruises and was being examined at a hospital.
   It was unclear whether Brown would be covered by diplomatic
immunity. Race said police had called the U.S. State Department for
guidance.
   A spokesman in the South African Embassy in Washington, Third
Secretary Heyn Van Rooyen, said Brown is connected with the
consulate in New York.
   ``There are different degrees of diplomatic immunity,'' said Van
Rooyen, adding he was not sure what would apply to Brown.
   Condon said about 30 members of the Vermont Committee on
Southern Africa had gathered outside the station to protest Brown's
participation in a talk show.
   He said Brown left the station under police escort and made his
way to a car in a parking lot. Brown got in and a few protesters
sat on the hood, Condon said.
   Police were in the process of removing protesters from the hood
when Brown ``hit the accelerator,'' Condon said.

<HEAD>Better Air Campaign Exceeded Goals; Oxy Fuels Program Right On
Target</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Metropolitan area residents exceeded the goals set
by the Better Air Campaign in reducing traffic volume and wood
smoke on high pollution days and met the oxygenated fuel program's
goals, officials announced Monday.
   Gov. Roy Romer and Denver Mayor Federico Pena reported the
results of the 90-day Better Air Campaign and the two-month
oxygenated fuels program at a news conference.
   ``The people of this area are to be congratulated,'' Romer said.
``By reducing their driving between November and January and by
restricting wood burning on high-pollution days, they have reduced
carbon monoxide pollution in the metro area by up to 17 percent.''
   The campaign's purpose was to reduce traffic volume and
wood-smoke pollution on days when temperature inversions caused
Denver's carbon-monoxide levels to soar.
   The project achieved a 9 percent reduction in traffic on
high-pollution days, equivalent to three million miles daily, and a
10 percent reduction in carbon monoxide vehicle emissions, said
Anne Grady, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of health's Air
Pollution Control Division. She said the program's goal was an 8
percent traffic reduction and a 9 percent reduction in carbon
monoxide.
   Carbon monoxide emissions from wood-burning fell 7 percent on
high-pollution days during the most recent Better Air Campaign,
said Grady, and the goal was a 6 percent reduction.
   Pena said the 7 percent carbon monoxide reduction attributable
to observance of wood-burning bans was more than double last year's
results.
   The Better Air Campaign ran from early November until the end of
January. In its previous three years, it ran for just 60 days.
   The oxygenated fuels program, which was launched for the first
time in January and lasted two months, required all service
stations along the 130-mile corridor along the Front Range between
Colorado Springs and Fort Collins to sell only oxygenated fuels, or
fuels containing at least 1.5 percent oxygen.
   The program's purpose was to provide a gasoline that would burn
cleaner in car engines and thus contribute less carbon monoxide
pollution, officials said. Motorists were offered the choice of an
ether-gasoline blend, or gasohol, which contains ethyl alcohol.
   Grady said the oxy fuels program was right on target in its goal
of reducing ambient carbon-monoxide levels by 8 percent to 10
percent. The reduction was in the 8 percent to 9.5 percent range,
she said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical student whose nickname and appearance
were similar to another student's may have been tortured and
murdered by mistake by killers hired to hit his classmate,
investigators said.
   Both students were Cuban-Americans from Florida, both were
studying medicine at the Universidad Central del Este in the
Dominican Republic, but they did not know each other.
   The body of Ignacio Pereda, 26, of Miami, dumped near a sugar
cane field two days after he was kidnapped, had been beaten so
badly that only a birthmark on the back of one hand permitted his
identification, The Miami Herald reported Monday, quoting the
victim's family.
   His abduction came just three weeks before he was scheduled to
graduate from the Caribbean medical school on Feb. 12.
   Police, stumped for a motive, began looking into an earlier
incident involving another Cuban-American student at the University.
   Shortly before the killing, student Jorge Sotolongo had a run-in
with a jealous husband, who fired his gun but hit no one, The
Herald reported.
   The two young men resembled each other and Pereda, from Miami,
was known by a nickname similar to Sotolongo _ Bobolongo.
   ``We believe the murder could have been a mistake,'' said First
Lt. Jose Antonio Torres of San Pedro de Macoris, a town about 40
miles east of the capital of Santo Domingo, where the body was
found.
   Sotolongo has returned to his home in St. Petersburg.
   ``I don't think he is in any danger, he is here with me,''
Sotolongo's father told The Herald. ``He is sorry for the other
boy. He doesn't know if they killed him by mistake or if they
wanted to kill him.''
   Pereda's murder devastated his parents, who have no other
children, and friends.
   ``He didn't smoke, or drink or fool around. He was very
educated, an old-fashioned person,'' said his classmate and
girlfriend, Virginia Garcia. ``No drugs, no alcohol, no women.
There are very few men like him nowadays.''
   One aunt, Aida Rodriguez, said she wants to go to the Dominican
Republic.
   ``We want answers,'' she said.

   The United States would welcome participation
by North Korean athletes in the Seoul Olympics, a senior U.S.
diplomat said Monday.
   ``The Olympics would be better off if North Korea chooses to
participate,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Edward Derwinski.
``But time is running out.''
   He added that ``we have nothing but a positive attitude'' toward
participation by Pyongyang.
   Derwinski said the United States will have ``some additional
naval units'' in the region at the time of the September Olympic
Games. Speaking at the U.S. Information Agency's Foreign Press
Center, he said the additional naval presence was ``a very timely,
practical coincidence.''
   Other U.S. officials have said the additional presence will
probably consist of one or two aircraft carriers.
   Derwinski warned that any attempt by the North Koreans to
disrupt the games ``would make them a total pariah.'' North Korea
is one of only a handful of countries, including Cuba, which is
boycotting the games.
   Derwinski indicated that the United States would ask visiting
Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian to use his country's leverage
with North Korea to prevent any disruption of the Olympics.
   ``This is the logical, diplomatic way to proceed'' with the
Pyongyang government, he said. ``We have no leverage with them, and
any suggestion on our part would be counterproductive.''

   The first California condor egg produced by
captive breeding is fertile and contains the makings of a chick,
San Diego Wild Animal Park officials said Monday.
   ``You can't actually see an embryo yet, but what you can see is
the beginnings of circulatory development, which appears as a dark
dime-sized dot toward the top of the yolk,'' park spokesman Tom
Hanscom said.
   The egg was laid Thursday, the product of a male condor known as
AC-4 and a female condor called UN-1. It was removed immediately
from its nest in the park's ``condorminium'' and placed in an
incubator.
   Keepers peeked inside the egg by holding it up to a
high-intensity lamp in a process known as ``candling.'' The egg
then was returned to its incubator, where it will be kept until the
hatching expected between April 28 and May 3, Hanscom said.
   ``Now, we incubate the egg according to the parameters that have
worked so well in the past and hope ... we can hatch a healthy
condor chick,'' he said.
   All 27 living California condors are in captivity. Fourteen are
kept at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Thirteen of the 27 birds were hatched in captivity in an effort
to build a breeding flock to save the rare birds from extinction.
Each of those eggs were taken from nests in the wild.
   The breeding program has been conducted at the San Diego Zoo and
its affiliate, the Wild Animal Park, since 1983 in cooperation with
state and federal wildlife officials.
   The last known wild condor was captured in April 1987 by
government biologists after it was determined the carrion-eating
birds' existence was threatened by lead poisoning in their food
supply and human encroachment upon their central California habitat.
   ``Our success or failure has pivoted on the captive production
of a fertile egg and that's what we've got,'' Hanscom said of the
4-day-old egg.
   Meanwhile, the parents of the egg were said to be doing well.
Keepers removed the shell from its nest soon after it was laid to
stimulate more breeding activity by the pair, which Hanscom said
has begun.
   ``That's real positive,'' he said. ``That would lead us to hope
for the production of a second egg, which could come as early as 30
days after the first egg.
   ``The parents are doing fine, the egg is doing fine and the
keepers are doing fine.''

<HEAD>Number Of Serious Crimes Rise By 6.3 Percent</HEAD>

   More than 1 million serious crimes were
reported in Florida last year, a record number blamed in part on
the spread of ``crack'' cocaine and other drugs, authorities
announced Monday.
   The number of reported homicides, rapes, robberies, assaults,
burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle thefts rose 6.3 percent to
go over the 1 million mark for the first time, to 1,021,283, said
Robert Dempsey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement.
   ``As you know, the crime rate is driven to a large extent by the
drug problem. There is no question about that,'' Dempsey said.
   He urged Gov. Bob Martinez and the Legislature to consider
increasing spending for criminal justice. Presently, he said, 6
percent of an $18.5 billion budget is devoted to the criminal
justice system, which includes law enforcement and the courts, he
said.
   ``It's intolerable. We need to do something about addressing
credibility in the criminal justice area,'' Dempsey said. ``We need
to address the career criminals, the jail situation and some of the
weaknesses in the so-called criminal justice system, which as many
of you know is no system at all.''
   Dempsey also said citizens need to start a grassroots campaign
to help prevent violence and property thefts. Increases in property
crime, particularly in some of the more rural counties, can be
directly attributed to the increase of the powerful crack form of
cocaine, the commissioner said.
   ``Anybody who tells you the drug problem is leveling off is in
fairyland. They don't know what's happening,'' he said.
   The Florida figures released Monday were preliminary. A complete
report was expected to be issued later this year.
   The commissioner said Florida continues to lead other states in
crime rates, or the number of crimes reported per 100,000
population. He compared Florida's 1987 figures with figures
reported by other states in 1986.
   ``We have the highest crime rate in the nation,'' said Dempsey.
   Department spokesman John Joyce said Florida's per-capita crime
rate, which increased by 2.9 percent in 1987, has been
significantly higher in past years than the figures reported by
other states. Since Florida is one of the first to release its
figures, new data was unavailable in other states.
   In 1986, Florida had 8,238 serious crimes reported per 100,000
population, compared with 7,408 in Texas, 7,322 in Arizona, 7,081
in Oregon, 7,032 in Colorado, 6,880 in Washington, 6,763 in
California, 6,626 in New Mexico, 6,491.5 in Michigan and 6,290 in
Nevada.
   The District of Columbia actually had the highest of all with
8,339 per 100,000 population.
   In Florida, the total arrests for cocaine last year were up 32.8
percent over 1986, while property crimes increased 6.7 percent over
1986. The number of motor vehicle thefts rose by 16.4 percent, and
aggravated assaults showed a 3.1 percent increase.
   The number of reported murders and rapes was slightly down.
Homicides declined from 1,371 to 1,368 and rapes declined from
6,153 to 6,017.
   More police officers were assaulted and killed in 1987 than the
previous year, 10 compared with six. Assaults on police officers
rose from 7,289 in 1986 to 7,833 in 1987.
   Dempsey acknowledged that the overall crime increase was not as
high as had been reported in recent years. From 1985 to 1986, his
department reported a 7.9 percent increase. The increase was 11.4
percent from 1984 to 1985.
   ``It's true the rate of increase is dropping but it is still an
increase,'' Dempsey said.

   U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum opened his bid
for a third, six-year term on Monday, describing himself as a
fighter and warning backers to brace for negative ads and gutter
politics from opponents.
   ``This battle that I'm about to embark upon today will be the
toughest battle that I've ever experienced in my lifetime. I cannot
tell you all the details of all the stuff, and nonsense, and sleaze
that they're pouring into Ohio,'' Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told an
airport rally.
   ``I'm asking Ohioans to judge this campaign not on nasty,
negative ads nor gutter politics. You'll see plenty of both thrown
our way, and it's already started,'' said Metzenbaum, who is being
challenged by Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican, in
the Nov. 8 election.
   ``There are some powerful forces who want to see me out of the
Senate. For them no price is too high, no tactic is too low,''
Metzenbaum said.
   The rally, which drew a crowd of about 100 that included
officeholders and union members, was one of four as Metzenbaum
barnstormed the state in a plane piloted by U.S. Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, his campaign chairman. Other stops were in Cincinnati,
Dayton and Cleveland.

   A 31-month pretrial detention ended
Monday for a defendant in the Wells Fargo robbery case after a
judge approved arrangements for his $1 million bond.
   Juan Segarra Palmer was released after U.S. District Judge Peter
Dorsey signed the papers. Segarra Palmer and another Wells Fargo
defendant, Filiberto Ojeda Rios, had been held without bond longer
than any other defendants in federal judicial history.
   Segarra Palmer's father, Enrique Segarra, testified before a
U.S. magistrate earlier Monday that his son would be disgraced
``personally and politically'' if he failed to appear for trial on
charges in the 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot
in West Hartford.
   ``He is a person of great character,'' Enrique Segarra said.
``If he said he will be here, he will be here.''
   ``I'm happy, but I have to say the real issue is not my
freedom,'' Harvard-educated Segarra Palmer, 38, said as he walked
out of court. ``The real issue is the freedom of Puerto Rico and
preventive detention.''
   Segarra Palmer, who was arrested in August 1985 in Puerto Rico,
was held without bond until last month, when U.S. District Judge T.
Emmet Clarie set bond at $1 million.
   Clarie has, however, refused to do the same for Ojeda Rios,
saying the defendant could flee to avoid prosecution.
   Segarra Palmer's bond is secured partly by $500,000 in property
owned by 11 people in the town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico, the
hometown of his wife, Luz Berrios Berrios, another Wells Fargo
defendant who has been free on bond for some time.
   The other $500,000 is unsecured, but his parents and three
siblings signed agreements to pay the money should Segarra Palmer
not appear for trial.
   Under terms of his bond, Segarra Palmer cannot leave Hartford,
must be home by 10 p.m. each night and agreed that the government
has the right to try him in absentia should he flee. The government
also plans to require him to wear an electronic bracelet to monitor
his movements, but none of the devices are available in Hartford,
said his attorney, Leonard Weinglass.
   Sixteen people are awaiting trial in the Wells Fargo robbery,
which the government contends was masterminded by Los Matcheros, a
radical, sometimes violent group advocating Puerto Rican
independence.
   Victor Gerena of Hartford, the Wells Fargo guard authorities
allege carried out the robbery, hasn't been captured. Prosecutors
say they think he is in Cuba.
   Pretrial hearings in the case began 14 months ago and are
expected to last several more months.

   An Eastern Airlines passenger was free on bond
Monday after allegedly battling police and ticket agents when he
and 200 irate passengers were bumped off New York-bound flights.
   It was the latest of several incidents in recent months that
have plagued Eastern in the wake of canceled flights and bumpings.
   The confrontation Sunday began when 226 passengers were bumped
from a 3:15 p.m. flight to La Guardia, said Eastern spokesman Bob
Carson. Some were later bumped repeatedly from other flights, and
were demanding to get on the final flight of the night about 9:30
p.m.
   The angry passengers pushed up against the ticket counter when
the flight was called, and Jack Lemonik, 26, of Great Neck, N.Y,
allegedly went behind the counter, said Metro-Dade police Lt.
Robert Otero.
   Lemonik allegedly punched one ticket agent in the chest and
pushed another with his rucksack before police moved in.
   Three officers grabbed Lemonik, Otero said. One hit his leg on a
trash can and fell to the ground, and was later treated for a knee
injury, Otero said.
   Passengers shouted angrily at police as they struggled with
Lemonik, said Curt Arnel, 30, of Merrick, N.Y.
   Lemonik was charged with two counts of simple battery,
aggravated battery and resisting arrest with violence, said
Metro-Dade police spokeswoman Lizette Williams. He was released on
$5,500 bond Monday, police said.
   Passengers who could not be booked back to New York on Sunday
were put up in hotels and were to be put on flights Monday, said
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.

<HEAD>Bush Looks For Super Super Tuesday; Democrats Try to Break From
the Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential rivals searched Monday for a way to stop
George Bush from a clean sweep on Super Tuesday, while Democrats
scoured the South for the votes that could propel one of them out
of the tightly bunched pack on the biggest primary day in U.S.
history.
   Vice President Bush said a sweep of the 17 GOP primaries was
``too much for anyone to expect.'' But he was leading polls in
virtually every Super Tuesday state except Missouri, where Sen. Bob
Dole of Kansas had a narrow edge.
   Even Dole conceded in Oklahoma City ``it's fair to say George
Bush has a good margin,'' but said the race is tight in Oklahoma,
Missouri and North Carolina.
   Earlier, the Kansas senator said in Birmingham, Ala., ``My
philosophy in the South ought to sell like hotcakes, but so far it
isn't happening. Bush is getting a lot of ruboff from Ronald
Reagan.''
   Dole claimed polls show ``that I beat all the Democrats. (Bush)
doesn't beat any of them .... We ought to nominate a winner instead
of a loser.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, hoping to emerge from the
Super Tuesday contests in his home state and 20 others with a
delegate lead, campaigned at a retirees' condominium development in
North Miami Beach and picked up the backing of Annie Ackerman, 74,
a onetime Chicago ward organizer now known for her prowess in
turning retirees out to vote. She called him ``a person of
integrity who gets things done'' and ``a mensch,'' using the
Yiddish word for good man.
   Asked if Super Tuesday was a flop in bringing moderate and
conservative Democrats back to the party's fold, the governor
replied, ``It's not been a flop for Mike Dukakis.''
   Four of his rivals _ Jesse Jackson, Richard Gephardt, Albert
Gore Jr. and Gary Hart _ were in Texas Monday.
   Jackson, hoping the allegiance of black voters throughout the
South will give him his finest hour in two runs for the presidency,
visited an AIDS clinic in Dallas and journeyed to Brownsville,
Texas, where he pledged to fight efforts to make English the
official language of the United States.
   ``We are a great nation. We can speak more than one language,''
said Jackson.
   Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who has staked his campaign
on a tough stance against countries with unfair trade practices,
made a pitch in Dallas for an oil import fee and campaigned in San
Antonio in front of a landmark.
   ``We're standing today in front of the Alamo, a place where
there was a fight for independence,'' Gephardt said. ``This
election in 1988 is a fight again for the independence of America,
the fight for us to regain control of our economic destiny.''
   In Dallas, outside a plant that has cut its production of oil
field equipment nearly in half, Gephardt said, ``Anyone like Al
Gore or Michael Dukakis who tells you that they're for making
America energy-independent without being for an oil import fee is
simply trying to deceive you in a shameful way.''
   ``Something's happening out there,'' Gore said, insisting the
undecided vote was breaking his way. He said the Democrats would
have a two-man race after Tuesday, and he would be one of the two.
   Gore got a boost from Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who left word
after he departed on a trip to the Soviet Union that he had cast an
absentee ballot for the Tennessee senator.
   Pat Robertson raised again his claim that there are Soviet
missiles in Cuba, telling a satellite radio audience in 18 states,
``I don't think the missiles ever got taken out in '62. And I am
somewhat convinced that more missiles have been introduced.''
   A federal judge in Washington dismissed Robertson's $35 million
libel suit against former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who questioned his
Korean war record. The judge said McCloskey was the prevailing
party in the acrimonious lawsuit. Robertson agreed to pay court
costs but not McCloskey's legal fees.
   Super Tuesday, the biggest primary day in history, saw GOP
voters go the primary polls in 17 states and Democrats choose
candidates in 20 states. There are 712 Republican and 1,307
Democratic delegates at stake.
   Dukakis was hoping for a strong harvest of delegates from Texas,
Florida and Maryland, as well as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Washington state.
   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force II en route to
Columbia, Mo., was asked about the possibility of a sweep. ``You
always wish for that, but I certainly would never predict that.
It's took much for anyone to expect,'' he replied.
   Bush, who clobbered Dole, Robertson and Jack Kemp in South
Carolina's primary on Saturday, admitted he was tired.
   ``It's been a difficult effort leading up to Super Tuesday,'' he
said, adding that on Tuesday itself ``we've got a pretty relaxing
day _ except for the tension factor.''

<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson renewed his contention that
there are Soviet missiles in Cuba on Monday and also said the
Federal Reserve Board was unconstitutional.
   Earlier, in Wichita Falls, Texas, the Republican presidential
candidate said he was satisfied with a federal judge's dismissal of
his libel suit against a former congressman who had questioned
Robertson's war record.
   In Texas, the biggest Super Tuesday prize with 111 GOP
delegates, Robertson talked about military needs and about his
contentions concerning missiles.
   ``In New England, they thought it was a gaffe when I said there
were missiles in Cuba, but those Cubans (in Florida) don't believe
it's a gaffe. They believe there's Russian missiles in Cuba,'' he
said.
   Later, in a call-in show on Shreveport's KFLO radio, he said,
``Everybody in the Miami area _ almost without exception _
certainly 95 percent of those Cuban-Americans know in their hearts
that there are missiles in Cuba. I don't think the missiles ever
got taken out in '62. And I am somewhat convinced that more
missiles have been introduced.''
   To support his contention, he said Cuban leader Fidel has denied
the missiles are there and has criticized Robertson for saying they
are.
   On other subjects raised on the call-in show, Robertson said:
   _``There has been filed, by a United States senator from
Montana, a suit in the federal court alleging that the Federal
Reserve Board is unconstitutional. I think it's true.''
   _The Supreme Court needs people like (Justices) Antonin Scalia,
William Rehnquist (and defeated nominee) Robert Bork, people like
that, who honor the Constitution as it was written.''
   _``Not one of the trading partners of America truly is dealing
fairly with us. They're either restricting imports into their
country on the one hand, or they are subsidizing unfairly exports
from their country to us.''
   _``I believe, in my heart, and from some indication from some
people who I've talked to, that there are American servicemen still
in Laos. They aren't in Vietnam, they're in Laos. ... I believe we
could put a throttle-hold around some of those Southeast Asian
nations, to make them insist those missing-in-action people come
out of there.''
   _Raising the possibility of an alternative to the United
Nations, ``I think if we had an alternate organization of free
nations, democratic nations, who did not commit terrorism and did
not torture and abuse their own citizens, we could have the power
of the world. And we could exclude from that agency the Soviet
Union, the East Bloc countries and these other dictators that are
practicing slavery and what have you against their people.''
   In Washington, a U.S. District Court judge dismissed Robertson's
$35 million suit against former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., who had
accused Robertson of ducking combat duty during the Korean War.
   ``The judge gave me what I consider a real victory,'' Robertson
said during a news conference at Wichita Falls' Municipal Airport.
   However, McCloskey said, ``This is a confirmation of my
integrity.'' Robertson, in asking that the suit be dropped, ``is
admitting that he is the one who is the liar,'' McCloskey said.
``The court's service was to unmask this man as the fraud he is.''
   Robertson had said he had to ask that the suit be dismissed
since he couldn't pursue the presidency and go through the trial
that was to start on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Makes Sales Pitch on Economic Reform to Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has told factory workers not
to be discouraged by slow improvements in their standard of living
and to have faith in his overhaul of the economy.
   He visited the enormous First State Ball Bearing Plant in
Moscow, his first meeting with rank-and-file workers since a
sweeping law took effect Jan. 1 giving factories more financial
independence from central ministries.
   Gorbachev said he was particularly sensitive to complaints about
poor housing and food and said they were top priorities for
improvement.
   The 57-year-old Soviet leader visited the factory Friday but
media did not report on the trip until Monday. Why the reports were
delayed was not clear.
   ``Of course we have a sufficient number of problems,'' Gorbachev
told the workers. ``Part of them are left from the past, others
were born today, in the course of restructuring, in the process of
realizing economic reforms. That's natural. But I have the
impression that you haven't panicked, and I would say are
optimistically looking to the future and confidently going
forward.''
   Gorbachev has visited factories several times since becoming
Communist Party general secretary three years ago, highlighting the
importance he attaches to workers' roles in reviving the sluggish
Soviet economy.
   The ball bearing plant employs 20,000 factory and office
workers. Gorbachev said he wanted to get a first-hand look at how
the government's new economic reforms are being implemented.
   ``For politics, the most important thing is to know the mood of
the people, to feel the pulse of life,'' Gorbachev said in remarks
carried by the official news agency Tass.
   He explained to the workers why some of his economic policies
may be hard to swallow, because they mean harder work and in some
cases less pay. Salaries, he said, must be adjusted according to
the productivity and quality of labor.
   ``How can you pay someone a full ruble if he hasn't earned it?
What will he buy with this money?'' he said.
   He said the reason desired goods have not been available in
stores is that workers were guaranteed salaries whether or not they
did their jobs properly.
   Under the new law, managers at factories responsible for 60
percent of the country's industrial output can bargain with
suppliers and wholesale customers for some products. Enterprises
are free to keep some of their profits, but those that are
unsuccessful are liable to be declared bankrupt. The factories set
workers' salaries according to the quality of their work.
   Gorbachev critcized plant managers who try to find an easy way
out of improving output by buying foreign equipment.
   ``Obviously you must buy some things, but only that which is
absolutely necessary, and you should rely on your own domestic
machine-building, on the achievements of our engineering.''
   He assured the workers socialism will not be threatened by the
country's growing private enterprises, known as cooperatives.
   ``It's understood that we need industrious and honest
initiative, but not of the kind of some cooperatives which exploit
a deficit and engage in outright money-grabbing,'' Gorbachev said.
   Limited private enterprise has been allowed to supplement
state-run enterprises since May 1987. Prices of the goods and
services produced by cooperatives are generally much higher, but
Gorbachev told the workers the government plans to get its fair
share of profits, through a progressive tax.

<HEAD>Judge Bars INS from Routine Strip-Searching of Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Routine strip searches of children awaiting
deportation are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled Monday,
saying immigration agents must first have a reasonable suspicion
that drugs or weapons have been hidden.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher rejected an Immigration and
Naturalization Service argument that the body-cavity searches are
needed because adults will use children as couriers if agents
cannot search them.
   ``Children confined by the INS are not charged with any criminal
offense, let alone an offense that might indicate a propensity to
conceal weapons or contraband on their persons,'' Kelleher ruled.
   In 1987, of 84,000 aliens searched, there were 20 discoveries of
contraband or weapons, only four of which were related to
juveniles, Kelleher noted.
   His ruling came in a class-action suit filed in 1985 by a
coalition of immigrants' rights groups that challenged what they
described as routine strip-searches of children upon admission to
INS detention facilities and following all visits with anyone other
than attorneys.
   Children are particularly susceptible to trauma from strip
searches, Kelleher said. He rejected an argument by Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ian Fan that children from Central America have no
expectation of privacy when arrested here.
   ``Many carry the expectation of liberty, opportunity and a
better life, the embodiment of which is our Constitution,''
Kelleher wrote.
   Only children are affected by the ruling. John Hagar, an
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer involved in the suit, said
the ruling covers all nine states in the INS' Western Region.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit has
identified 9,800 people as former concentration camp guards and
said Monday it will have them placed on the immigration watch list
of individuals to be barred from the United States.
   The Office of Special Investigations compiled the names with the
assistance of a sophisticated new computer database.
   Names of suspected criminals and Nazi persecutors are
systematically checked against immigration records to determine if
they are in the United States.
   The names of individuals not found to be in this country are
included in the watch list to prevent them from entering.
   OSI has listed thousands of such people in the past few years.
But the 9,800 now to be placed on the watch list of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service ``for serving as
concentration and death camp guards is probably the greatest
number'' to be added at one time, said the office's chief, Neal
Sher.
   The watch list includes people who are prohibited from entering
the United States under a federal law barring individuals who
assisted or otherwise participated in Nazi-sponsored persecution.
   The provision, known as the Holtzman Amendment, was invoked when
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was placed on the watch list last
year following a decision by Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   The Justice Department cited evidence that Waldheim had
participated in activities amounting to persecution of Jews and
others in Greece and Yugoslavia in World War II when he was a
German army intelligence officer.
   The immigration watch list contains some 40,000 names. In
addition to those participating in Nazi-directed persecution, the
list contains the names of criminals, known terrorists, communists
or people who have been deported from the United States.
   Duke Austin, an INS spokesman, said names submitted by the
office of special investigations are routinely added to the watch
list.

<HEAD>U.S. Again Says It Wants Early Response to Mideast Peace Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

   The Reagan administration renewed its request
on Monday for an ``early response'' from Israel to a U.S. Middle
East peace initiative.
   It also said it welcomed the ``the support and advice'' of 30
senators who contend Israel should be willing to give up control of
occupied land in return for Middle East peace.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said the
administration is looking for a reply to Secretary of State George
P. Shultz's plan to set up negotiations on Palestinian self-rule by
May 1.
   Redman's comment appeared to be directed to Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is due in Washington next week for
meetings with President Reagan and Shultz.
   ``We believe all the parties understand and appreciate the
reason that we've asked for these kind of responses,'' Redman said.
   Shultz just returned from a Middle East trip during which he
promoted a plan to bring Israel, Jordan, Syria and Palestinian
Arabs to a peace conference by May 1. One goal is to stop violence
in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank regions that has
claimed some 80 Arab lives in three months.
   Shultz briefed Regan on Monday on his travels.
   On Sunday, Shamir blocked a decision by the Israeli Cabinet on
the U.S. initiative. He said he would permit a vote after he
returns from his talks in Washington, but Israeli Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres had demanded a Cabinet decision before Shamir departed.
   Redman avoided a direct reaction to Shamir's move, but he went
on to call for an ``early response'' from Israel and the three Arab
governments _ Jordan, Egypt and Syria _ to whom Shultz submitted
his plan.
   Shultz said during his Middle East travels last week that he
hoped for a reply within about 10 days. He said he believed in
deadlines as a way of accelerating action.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked about
the letter from the 23 Democrats and seven Republicans, a group
that included several strong supporters of the Jewish state.
   The senators noted that Israel has in the past supported the
idea of ``land for peace'' by returning the Sinai Peninsula to
Egypt. But they cited a statement by Shamir that ``this expression
of territory for peace is not accepted by me.''
   ``We hope that the prime minister's statement did not indicate
that Israel is abandoning a policy that offers the best hope for
long-term peace,'' said the letter, dated March 3.
   ``The administration welcomes the support and advice from this
group. They are senators of considerable stature and interest and
involvment in Middle East affairs,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   ``We are in the midst of an ongoing processs. The views of these
senators are helpful to us and probably instructive to other
parties in the region,'' he added.
   The spokesman said the administration was involved in a process
``that involves a blend of some new ideas and new beliefs,'' but he
refused to comment further.
   At the State Department, Redman said Shultz would respond to the
letter. He declined to address the matter further, except to say
the administration prefers ``to maintain a certain discreet
distance'' in the Mideast peace process.
   When he returned Saturday from the Middle East, Shultz expressed
no criticism of Shamir's position. He said the prime minister and
Peres agreed that Israel's annexation of territory could be a topic
for negotiations.
   Peres and his Labor Party have openly endorsed Shultz's
proposals, while Shamir and his Likud Party have not.
   Strong supporters of Israel signing the letter included senators
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Frank R.
Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; and Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.
   Others whose names were on the letter included senators Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii; Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn.; George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine; Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D.;
J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa; Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; J.
James Exon, D-Neb.; Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.; John Kerry, D-Mass.;
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky; William S. Cohen, R-Maine; Alan K. Simpson,
R-Wyo.; Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo.;
Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said Monday that two leaders
would emerge from the Democratic presidential field after Super
Tuesday balloting and he would be one of them.
   ``Something's happening out there,'' Gore said, wrapping up his
Texas campaign with an airport appearance in Houston, his fifth
visit to the city in the past three weeks.
   ``The undecided vote is still large but it is breaking our way.
We are getting reports from all over the Super Tuesday area and all
indicate exactly the same thing. Our campaign has the momentum.''
   The Tennessee senator said his polls throughout the South show
him surpassing Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt and trailing only Jesse Jackson.
   ``We have gained more in the last 24 hours than any other
candidate,'' he said. ``If our people get to the polls, we are
going to pull off a major surprise to those people who were
beginning to think it was a two-person race. It's going to be a
two-person race all right, but they're going to have a different
two candidates in mind.''
   Gore refused to identify the candidate he saw as also emerging
as a front-runner after Tuesday's elections.
   ``I'm not going to pick the field,'' he said. ``You'll be able
to see the pattern develop.''
   Asked what would happen if he finished fourth, he replied: ``I
refuse to accept that. That's not going to happen. Write it down
and check it twice. We're going to come out with a very surprising
victory.''
   Gore said he picked up the endorsements Monday of Georgia Gov.
Joe Frank Harris and Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La. Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia announced his endorsement of Gore on Sunday.

<HEAD>Air Force Chief Vows Readiness Despite Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 14th graf bgng ``Asked what ... '' to make clear that
question was about cutting money for both Midgetman and mobile MX.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force's top officer says he never
dreamed the Reagan administration's military build-up would be
derailed so quickly, but he intends to maintain readiness even as
his service shrinks.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch also said Monday the Air Force couldn't
afford to develop the new Midgetman nuclear missile favored by many
congressional leaders; said he would press for salary bonuses for
pilots and make it easier for young pilots to stay in the cockpit;
and would shut down at least three Air Force bases if Congress let
him.
   The four-star general added the public shouldn't be too
concerned by press reports of delays in flight testing the new
``Stealth'' bomber, and said he intends to repair strained
relations with Congress with a new openness about the onset of
contracting problems.
   Welch was interviewed by The Associated Press on the eve of
congressional hearings on the Air Force's fiscal 1989 budget. That
budget blueprint, designed to comply with a deficit-reduction plan,
cuts Air Force spending authority by $10 billion compared with what
the service wanted and eliminates more than 23,000 active-duty job
slots.
   The 53-year-old Welch said it already was clear when he took
over the Air Force in July 1986 that military spending was going to
be slashed.
   ``But we thought at the worst, we would level (off),'' Welch
added. ``We never expected a real decline. We were certainly not
expecting that from 1985 through 1989, there would be a 13 percent
overall decline in real buying power.''
   The only way to cope with such cuts, Welch continued, is to
reduce the size of the force. Otherwise, too little money is spread
too thinly to maintain combat readiness, he said.
   ``To keep a ready force, we'll have to have a somewhat smaller
force,'' the general said. ``And we will be deferring some things,
delaying some things.''
   Among the programs taking a large cut is the Midgetman missile,
a one-warhead nuclear missile that would be deployed on a
truck-like launcher to make it more survivable. The Air Force would
like to kill the program outright, but requested enough money to
keep research going until a new administration makes a final
decision.
   Welch said he knew that congressional Democrats favored the
project. But the Midgetman is so expensive it makes more sense to
develop a mobile rail launcher for the existing 10-warhead MX
missile, he said.
   Deploying the Midgetman would cost $36 billion ``and the only
place we can find to take another $36 billion is out of
conventional forces,'' Welch said.
   That's too high of a pricetag ``for an incremental contribution
to deterrence,'' he added.
   Asked what would happen if Congress refused money for both the
Midgetman or a rail-mobile MX, Welch replied: ``I think that would
be absolutely irresponsible.''
   Turning to other topics, Welch said:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Air Force relations with Congress are strained because of a
perception the service tried to cover up problems with the B-1B
bomber. That is ``an absolutely false charge,'' Welch said, because
in truth the Air Force itself ``was badly surprised by the lag in
the development'' of B-1B radar-jamming gear.
   Nonetheless, ``we are (now) going to great pains to keep the
Congress thoroughly informed on anything that looks like a
problem.''
   _There's no reason for concern at this point about a delay in
flight testing the radar-evading Stealth, or B-2, bomber. Sources
have said the first flight test was pushed back four months to
August because of technical problems.
   ``I think we've been very realistic about (the B-2),'' Welch
said. ``Unlike some other programs, we didn't say five years in
advance that we're going to fly that airplane on the 23rd of May.
We knew better.
   _The Air Force is asking for money to pay its pilots a salary
bonus because re-enlistment rates have fallen to unacceptable
levels. Retention rates are running about 48 percent compared with
the target 60 percent, and for the first time in years, the Air
Force expects to end fiscal 1989 with an overall shortage of pilots
_ 22,312 on duty compared with 22,556 needed.
   _The Air Force also will try to keep its pilots happy by
changing promotion policies to make it clear to young lieutenants
and captains they should concentrate on flying, and not worry about
finding staff jobs to make them more promotable.
   _And if he had his druthers, he would try to save money by
closing unneeded bases. Welch declined to identify his candidates,
but said three bases could probably be closed quickly.

<HEAD>USDA To Test Pork Supply For Suspected Cancer-Causing Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal testing of the nation's pork supply is
being stepped up immediately as part of a crackdown on illegally
high traces of a suspected cancer-causing drug used widely by hog
producers, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Officials said the department's Food Safety and Inspection
Service will initiate random sampling of hog carcasses in 100 of
the nation's largest swine slaughter plants for laboratory tests to
determine levels of sulfamethazine.
   USDA officials on Feb. 4 had announced their goal was ``to
eliminate violative levels of the drug sulfamethazine'' in hogs
marketed in the United States.
   Two hog carcasses will be tested at each plant during the
initial phase of the program. If one or both hogs are found to
contain drug traces at or above the permitted level of 0.1 part per
million, the plant will be subjected to more intensive testing.
   Hog carcasses found to be within the drug's permitted level will
be released for consumption. Those with higher residues will be
condemned.
   A new ``sulfa-on-site'' (SOS) procedure for making quick
screening tests in the plants without sending samples to
laboratories for more detailed, time-consuming tests also is being
incorporated into the program, said Lester M. Crawford, FSIS
administrator.
   Sulfamethazine is used in swine to treat or prevent a number of
diseases and also is used in subtherapeutic dosages in feed to
promote faster growth and to improve weight gains. Illegally high
traces of the drug have been a problem in an average of about 5
percent of the hogs going to slaughter.
   A study by the Food and Drug Administration's National Center
for Toxicological Research in Arkansas tentatively determined that
sulfamethazine causes tumors in the thyroid glands of mice,
Crawford said last month when the new regulatory effort was
announced.

   The State Department has confirmed that the
Soviet Union is not allowing Lithuanian-American Povilas
Peciulaitis to emigrate despite a statement last December that he
would be free to leave, Rep. Edward Feighan said Monday.
   Feighan, D-Ohio, urged Secretary of State George P. Shultz to
quickly intervene and requested a meeting with Soviet Ambassador
Yuri Dubinin. He also sent a letter to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev asking that the matter be resolved quickly.
   ``They have the audacity to tell us now that it was a mistake,''
Feighan said of the Soviets. ``If the Soviets think I'm going to
stand by and meekly accept this broken promise, they had better
think again.''
   Peciulaitis, 64, was born in Lithuania, but his parents were
naturalized American citizens.
   Feighan said he fears for Peciulaitis' personal safety, adding
that verbal attacks against the man have recently appeared in
newspapers and on television in Lithuania.
   ``If the Soviets can renege on a promise, we can't be sure that
they won't try to harm Mr. Peciulaitis,'' Feighan said.
   Peciulaitis, who was exiled to Siberia for 22 years, is being
sponsored by his brother, who lives in suburban Cleveland.

<HEAD>Snow Falls Heavily In The Colorado Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp cold front brought a renewal of winter weather whistling
across the central Rockies and the western Plains on Monday.
   A winter storm warning was posted through the night into Tuesday
for the mountains of southern Colorado. Snowfall totals of 8 to 16
inches were possible, along with gusty wind causing considerable
blowing and drifting, the National Weather Service said.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted into the night
the southeastern Colorado plains and adjacent foothills and for the
San Luis Valley.
   A mixture of rain, sleet and snow extended from North Dakota to
western Nebraska and temperatures were in the 20s and 30s.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was issued for western
South Dakota, where wind accompanying the snow gusted to 59 mph at
the Rapid City Airport.
   Strong southerly wind ahead of the cold front drove temperatures
up into the 70s across much of Texas, and into the 60s as far north
as eastern Kansas and southern Missouri.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees at Laramie, Wyo., to 82 at Fort Myers, Fla. The low for the
day was 3 degrees above zero at Yellowstone National Park in
Wyoming.
   For Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
northern Texas and the central Gulf Coast into the middle
Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley, with showers in
southern sections of the upper Great Lakes. Snow was forecast in
the upper Mississippi Valley and northern sections of the upper
Great Lakes. Widely scattered showers were forecast from
northwestern Texas across much of Kansas and eastern Colorado.
   Highs in the 30s and 40s were predicted across a wide area from
northwestern Texas and western Oklahoma, much of the Rocky Mountain
region, the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley across to
New England; above 60 from Oregon to California and from the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas to the southern and mid-Atlantic Coast; in
the 70s from central California to southern Arizona, from
south-central Texas to Tennessee and Alabama, and from West
Virginia to northern Florida; in the 80s in southern Florida and
the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas; and in the 50s elsewhere.

<HEAD>No Prospect Yet for Bailout of S&L Insurance Fund, Regulator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's too soon to consider bailing out the
federal insurance fund for savings institutions or merging it with
the healthier funds for commercial banks and credit unions, the
nation's top regulator of S&Ls said Monday.
   ``I think that's vastly premature,'' said M. Danny Wall,
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Wall, speaking to the National Association of Federal Credit
Unions, said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
backs S&L deposits up to $100,000, has about $20 billion to work
with over the next three years.
   President Reagan in August signed legislation recapitalizing
FSLIC, which was technically insolvent and unable to deal with
failed S&Ls. The legislation provides $10.8 billion over three
years from the sale of bonds, to be paid off by a special
assessment on profitable institutions.
   Wall said it's too soon to determine whether that will be enough
to handle the industry's problems, particularly in the Southwest
where S&Ls have been hard hit by the faltering energy industry and
the consequent moribund real estate market.
   ``There's no way of knowing what the (regional) economies will
be or will have been in three years. ... (A rebound) could occur in
Texas. It could occur in other areas of the country. It could blow
all of our problems completely out of the water in a positive
way,'' Wall said.
   His comments came less than a week after two thrift industry
lobby groups began discussing the future of the insurance fund.
   A committee of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the
largest S&L trade association, discussed a plan that would require
billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out the ailing thrift industry.
   According to Mark Clark, a vice president of the league, the
committee talked about a number of possible scenarios, including
one that envisioned the issue of government notes to S&Ls. The
notes would be traded for bad loans owned by S&Ls and would be
guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.
   Clark said the committee meeting was simply a ``brain-storming
session'' and the plan ``is by no stretch of the imagination a
proposal.''
   The U.S. League discussion, as well as a proposal to merge
insurance funds, are particularly controversial because the thrift
industry, seeking a smaller burden on healthy S&Ls, argued for a
smaller recapitalization of FSLIC.
   The National Council of Savings Institutions, another trade
association, is proposing, as a contingency plan, a merger of FSLIC
with the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, which had $18.3 billion at
the end of 1987.
   The plan is unpopular with banks, which pay a premium for
deposit insurance that is less than half the premium paid by
savings institutions. A merger with the National Credit Union Share
Insurance Fund, which has about $1.3 billion, is equally unpopular
with that industry.
   John T. Morgan, chairman of the council, said last week that
FSLIC likely won't have enough money to take care of all insolvent
S&Ls. Wall talked of resolving the cases of 50 insolvent S&Ls this
year in addition to about 100 cases in Texas. Losses for the
industry as a whole are expected to surpass $4 billion for 1987.
   Morgan argues that there's a limit to how much more healthy S&Ls
can contribute and that Congress will not want to earmark tax money
without first tapping into the other insurance funds.
   Rep. Gerald Kleckza, D-Wis., has introduced legislation that
would merge the three insurance funds, as well as the federal
agencies that regulate the three segments of the financial system.
The council, however, would keep the regulatory agencies separate.
   Wall said he saw little prospect, at least in the near term,
that Congress would approve a merger of the funds or of the
regulatory apparatus and he argued that they were better left apart.

<HEAD>Court To Rule On Case Involving Trademarked Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday postponed until
later in the year a ruling in a multibillion-dollar battle over
so-called ``gray market'' goods, the growing business that allows
consumers to purchase costly imports at steep discounts.
   The justices announced they again will hear arguments in the
case in April with a decision expected by July.
   The case will be re-argued with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who
joined the court last month, taking part in the deliberations.
Kennedy's participation in the case will give the court six
members, a quorum, to consider the underlying dispute.
   Kennedy did not take part as the court ruled, 5-3, on Monday
that the Court of International Trade does not have exclusive
authority over the dispute. The majority said that a federal judge
properly considered the case.
   The three justices who dissented did so on a procedural issue.
They said the federal courts lacked jurisdiction, a decision that
would in effect disqualify them from considering the merits of the
case.
   The dispute is over interpretation of the Federal Tariff Act of
1930. The U.S. Customs Service says the law allows gray market
goods into the country without approval from trademark owners.
   Two leading discount distributors, K Mart Corp. and 47th Street
Photo Inc. of New York City, also are defending the Customs Service
regulations.
   Typically, the discount companies buy trademarked products in
the United States more cheaply than do the owners of the U.S.
trademarks.
   Some 60 major companies that own trademarks banded together to
form the Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks
and challenge the Customs Service regulations.
   A federal judge upheld the Customs Service regulations. But the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year that the rules
are invalid under the 1930 tariff act.
   The statute prohibits unauthorized imports of ``any merchandise
of foreign manufacture if such merchandise ... bears a trademark
owned by a citizen of, or by a corporation or association created
or organized within, the United States.''
   The Customs Service says the law protects only American
companies that purchase trademarks from independent foreign
manufacturers and does not protect American subsidiaries,
affiliates or parent companies of foreign manufacturers.
   Justice William J. Brennan wrote Monday's opinion upholding the
authority of the federal courts to rule in the dispute. He was
joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Dissenting on the jurisdictional issue were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day
O'Connor.

<HEAD>Mayor Shakes Up Public Works Department In Wake Of TV Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television expose showing city workers goofing
off has added fuel to a campaign to recall Mayor Federico Pena, the
mayor's opponents said Monday.
   A top public works official and two street workers lost their
jobs and Pena suspended four others following the KUSA-TV report
last week about city street crews.
   The mayor, who announced the action over the weekend, said he
will continue his investigation of the allegations and within the
next week expects to discipline several mid-level supervisors in
the Public Works Department, the city's largest agency with 1,770
employees.
   Meanwhile, Marge Doty, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Action
Committee, which is pushing the Pena recall, said the revelations
have ``added impetus to our movement, absolutely.''
   The campaign has half the petition signatures needed to force an
election to replace Pena, who was re-elected to a second three-year
term last year. Ms. Doty said she has not counted how many
signatures have been gathered on the 1,200 petitions being
circulated.
   A KUSA reporter and cameraman, using an unmarked car, followed
six city street crews around for several days to see what they
accomplished. Only two crews were shown working without excessive
breaks. In one case, a pothole repair crew did no work at all
during an eight-hour period, spending the time visiting several
food stores and loafing near parks.
   Lee Ramirez, deputy manager of the Public Works Department,
resigned following the reports, and Pena then fired two workers and
suspended four others.
   Pena told a news conference that Ramirez was ``a hard-working
and dedicated employee'' who had ``the fortitude ... to tender his
resignation in the best interest of the city. And I agree with that
conclusion.''
   Steve Newman, executive director of the Colorado chapter of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
two of the disciplined public works employees are innocent and
their punishments would be appealed.
   He also blamed the department's problems, which include a $1
million budget deficit, on poor management, nepotism, cronyism and
missing equipment.
   ``I will be meeting with the mayor this week, probably on
Thursday, and I will have a long list of documented problems and
incidents we've brought to their attention,'' he said. ``Hopefully,
this time he'll deal with it.''
   The movement to recall Pena began after citizens complained of
unplowed, impassable streets following a Christmas weekend
snowstorm.
   The Metropolitan Action Committee has until mid-April to collect
40,000 petition signatures.
   Gov. Roy Romer and three other Democratic leaders on Saturday
announced their opposition to the recall drive.
   ``Properly filling potholes'' is an issue worth debating, but
not serious enough to merit a recall election, the governor said.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., said Pena ``is the person who has
finally broken loose the airport and has made the convention center
come closer to being a reality. Those are the issues it seems to me
that we ought to be talking about.''
   Denver is close to reaching agreement to build a new, $4 billion
airport in neighboring Adams County to replace Stapleton
International Airport, and it will begin construction soon on a
$115 million convention center.

   The opening talks on a new long-term grain
agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union will get
under way here on March 19 instead of in Vienna, Austria, on March
11 as previously announced, a senior trade official said Monday.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Alan F. Holmer said in a
one-paragraph statement issued by the Agriculture Department that
the change was ``due to scheduling conflicts'' but did not
elaborate.
   The current five-year pact will expire on Sept. 30. It calls for
annual purchases of grain from the United States.
   Officials announced on March 4 that the negotiations on a new
agreement would begin March 11 in Vienna.

   Fifty-two members of the Senate are urging
South African President P.W. Botha to release a prominent South
African journalist jailed without charges for the last 14 months.
   In a letter made public Monday, the senators asked Botha to work
for the immediate release of Zwalakhe Sisulu, 38, an award-winning
journalist and editor of the The New Nation, a newspaper sponsored
by the Catholic Church. Sisulu was a Nieman fellow at Harvard
University during the 1984-85 academic year.
   The letter was made public by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
who hailed Sisulu as ``the best that journalism has to offer'' and
a reporter and editor who is ``passionate in his commitment to
non-violence and to building a truly non-racial society in South
Africa.''
   ``His arrest and incarceration were unconscionable,'' Kennedy
said. ``His continued detention _ without bail, without charges and
without trial _ is indefensible.''
   The letter said that Sisulu's imprisonment ``strengthens the
cause of those who pursue a racial agenda and who seek a violent
solution to South Africa's problems.''

   The government Monday presented 25
photogravures seized from a now-imprisoned drug dealer to the
National Museum of American Art.
   The work by photographer Edward Sheriff Curtis, part of the
artist's 20-volume work on North American Indians, was turned over
to museum director Charles C. Eldredge by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   The photographs printed from specially etched plates in a
process yielding great sensitivity of tone were among the items
confiscated from Ronald Francis Perry of San Francisco under a
federal law allowing the federal government to seize the assets of
drug traffickers.
   The photogravures were forfeited to the government after San
Francisco police investigating Perry discovered two pounds of
cocaine, a $30,000 art collection and $14,500 hidden in a secret
panel in a closet and took the case to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Perry pleaded guilty to drug and tax charges in 1987 and is
serving a sentence in federal prison in Allenwood, Pa.
   The government is selling Perry's home and the remainder of his
property, which includes 75 cases of fine wine, eight rare Persian
carpets, several handguns, a Porsche and a Mercedes.

   Communist guerrillas ambushed a
vehicle near Subic Bay, killing three civilians and six Filipino
sailors assigned to the U.S.-run naval base, the military said
Monday.
   The sailors, and three civilians who had hitched a ride, were
traveling from Subic to Manila on Sunday when rebels of the New
People's Army fired on their Land-Rover near Hermosa, on the Bataan
Peninsula 40 miles west of the capital, the Philippine Constabulary
reported.
   There were no reports of rebel casualties in the 15-minute
battle.
   Subic, about 50 miles west of Manila, is one of six military
facilities operated by the United States under an executive
agreement that expires in 1991.
   Communist rebels operate near both Subic Bay and Clark Air Base,
50 miles north of Manila. Last October, guerrillas killed three
Americans and a Filipino in coordinated attacks outside Clark.
   In a related development Monday, two Philippine Constabulary
troopers held hostage by Communist rebels for more than a month
said they killed nine guerrillas in an escape the day before.
   Noel de Leon and Roberto Nabua said they were captured Feb. 3 at
a rebel checkpoint outside San Francisco, a town near Catanauan,
110 miles southeast of Manila in Quezon province. They spoke to
Filipino reporters in Catanauan.
   They said they were tied up for 32 days and were moved from
place to place. De Leon and Nabua also said a foreigner they did
not identify took videotape pictures of them.
   On Sunday, the two said, they loosened their bindings and
grabbed the M-16 rifles of their two guards, who were cooking a
meal in a house at Buenavista, about 10 miles north of Catanauan.
They said they killed both guards and seven other rebels.
   In another report Monday, officials said one of the best-known
rebel priests had fled southern Mindanao island after being shot by
comrades who learned he was planning to surrender.
   Romeo Capangpangan, spokesman in Cebu City for the Social
Welfare Department, said the Rev. Frank Navarro was reported shot
in the shoulder last week by his own followers in Mindanao's
Surigao del Sur province.
   He said Navarro had sent word that he was recuperating at a
hideout in the area and wanted to surrender in return for amnesty.
Cebu City is 360 miles southeast of Manila.
   The government amnesty program for Communist and Moslem rebels
expired Feb. 29, but Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said rebels
still could receive amnesty on a case-by-case basis.
   According to the military, Navarro is a New People's Army leader
in eastern Mindanao. The army issued two reports last year that he
had been killed.

   Iraq and Iran fired missiles into each
other's largest cities Monday and sent aircraft to bomb towns in
the second week of a long-range duel that has killed hundreds of
civilians.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq fired three missiles
into Tehran, a city of 6 million.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Revolutionary Guards
fired five missiles at ``military centers'' in Baghdad in
retaliation for ``these inhuman acts,'' and hit the northern city
of Mosul with a missile for the first time.
   Both sides reported their border towns pounded by sustained
artillery fire and air raids that killed scores of people.
   It was the eighth day of missile exchanges between the Persian
Gulf neighbors, which have been at war since September 1980.
   Iraq confirmed that two missiles fell on residential sections of
Baghdad, whose population is 5 million, killing or wounding ``many
civilians, including women and children.''
   It said a missile hit a residential district of Mosul, killing
or wounding civilians and damaging several houses, shops and cars.
Mosul also was reported bombed.
   IRNA, the Iranian agency, said 30 civilians were killed and more
than 100 wounded in Tehran, most of them women and children. It
said one missile demolished a clinic, a school and several homes.
   Iraq says it has fired 41 missiles into the Iranian capital
since the exchanges began Feb. 29. The Iranians have reported
firing 23 missiles on Baghdad in that period, but the have
acknowledged only 18 hits.
   In Baghdad, Labor Minister Baker Mahmoud Rasoul said Iran began
the latest round in the ``war of the cities to pave the way for its
new (ground) offensive.''
   Vice President Taha Muhieddin Maarouf, also addressing the
gathering of Arab labor ministers, said ``Our armed forces are
fully ready to rout any Iranian offensive.''
   They apparently referred to threats Saturday by Hashemi
Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, to answer the Iraqi
missile barrage with action along the 730-mile border war front.
   Asian diplomats in Baghdad said Khalid Mahmoud, an emissary of
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, delivered a letter from President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as part of
a diplomatic effort to stop the aerial war. Its contents were not
disclosed.
   The missile exchange is the fiercest of the war. It is the first
time surface-to-surface missiles have hit Tehran, which is 290
miles from the Iraqi border. Iran periodically has launched
missiles at Baghdad, which is only 80 miles from the frontier.
   Iran has reported at least 122 civilians killed and more than
300 wounded by missiles, and more than 100 killed and 500 wounded
in air raids during the past week. Iraq has reported heavy civilian
casualties, but not exact figures.
   On Monday, Iran's news agency said 61 civilians were killed and
427 wounded by Iraqi air raids on Shiraz in the south and Dezful,
Khorramabad, Arak and a dozen other cities in the west.
   Iraq said its planes attacked the cities of Hamadan, Arak and
Kermanshah in western Iran.
   Tehran radio confirmed a raid on Arak, but there was no
immediate word on casualties or damage. It said Iranian warplanes
raided Basra, the southern Iraqi port near the border, and As-Sadiq
and Mosul in the southwest.
   According to the Iraqi News Agency, ``many civilians'' were
killed or wounded in the raids.
   The Iranians said their artillery hammered military and economic
targets in Amarah, Qurna and Aziz, north of Basra, through the
night and morning. They said Iraqi gunners shelled Marivan in
northwest Iran, killing one person and wounding several.

   Rep. Jack Kemp said Monday he would press
on with his Republican presidential campaign regardless of the
outcome of the Super Tuesday contests.
   Kemp told a news conference at the state Capitol that his
disappointing showing in the race so far had not caused him to
consider dropping out.
   ``I'm running for ideas, for a cause, to keep the Reagan
revolution alive,'' he said.
   He said he did not know how he would do on Super Tuesday, but
thought the race would remain open. And he said he planned to press
his campaign in next week's Illinois primary.
   Kemp said he saw himself as ``a bridge candidate,'' whom
followers of Vice President George Bush, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and
former television evangelist Pat Robertson all could turn to if the
race is not wrapped up by the time of the Republican National
Convention.
   ``I think ultimately that the Republican Party is going to want
a conservative to follow Ronald Reagan,'' he said.
   He repeated his assertion that he is not interested in the vice
presidential nomination.
   ``I don't expect it. I don't think it will be offered. I don't
want it. And besides, I'm a quarterback and not a lineman,'' said
the former professional football player.
   Kemp conceded that the oil and agriculture industries had not
shared fully in the economic successes of the Reagan
administration. But he said he did not favor an oil import fee,
calling that ``a quick fix.'' He said lower interest rates would
help the energy industry more in the long run.
   He also advocated repealing the windfall profits tax and called
for further deregulation of natural gas.
   In a speech to the Oklahoma Legislature prior to the news
conference, Kemp drew applause when he denounced Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega and called for continued support
of the Contras in Nicaragua.
   He said it would be ``a big mistake'' for the United States to
accept a communist base in Nicaragua. He said that would pose a
threat to the Panama Canal and Nicaragua's neighbors and
``ultimately to Mexico.''

   A court convicted 16 people in
Belgium's biggest child sex case Monday, including the former head
of the U.N. Children's Fund for Belgium.
   They were given prison terms of up to 10 years, but some lesser
terms were suspended. Two defendants were acquitted.
   Most were arrested soon after the case came to light early last
year and spent several months in jail before the trial. The trial
revealed the existence of Belgian and international child sex rings.
   Several adults who lent their children to adults for sex were
among the defendants. The husband of one of the two mothers
acquitted is to be tried later.
   Jean-Claude Weber, a 40-year-old film producer now jailed in
France on similar charges, got the longest sentence, 10 years.
   Philippe Carpentier, 46, got nine years. He heads an association
whose public purpose was to help pedophiles overcome their
compulsion but actually supplied them with children.
   Michel Felu, 47, a member of the UNICEF Belgian staff who used
the Children's Fund offices and equipment to make pornographic
pictures for use in special international magazines, was sentenced
to eight years.
   Jozef Verbeeck, 63, former head of UNICEF-Belgium, was given a
two-year suspended sentence. One mother got three years suspended
and another a 30-month suspended sentence.
   UNICEF was awarded symbolic damages of one franc for the harm it
suffered.

<HEAD>US Wants More High Tech Exports to China, Shultz Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th graf pvs, bgng: ``Although no

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met Monday
with Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian and said the United States
is prepared to increase high technology exports to China.
   During toasts following their State Department luncheon, the two
leaders hailed the progress in bilateral relations and made almost
no reference to issues which divide them.
   Chief among them is China's reported sales of military weaponry
to Iran in defiance of U.S. efforts at the United Nations to win
support for a worldwide arms embargo against Iran. The
administration has been seeking assurances from China that it will
not veto an embargo resolution.
   The Reagan administration has generally refrained from public
condemnations of the Chinese sales, and Shultz on Monday alluded
only to press reports in both countries of U.S.-Chinese
``differences'' on the Persian Gulf war.
   Administration officials have indicated a willingness to
increase high technology exports to China in exchange for a Chinese
commitment to halt delivery of weapons to Iran.
   Although Shultz made no direct link between the two issues, he
indicated U.S. interest in increasing sales of sophisticated
technology to China.
   ``Over the last five years, the United States has significantly
liberalized its controls over technology exports to China, and we
are prepared to do more to ensure U.S. exporters remain competitive
in the China market,'' he said.
   Last October, the United States retaliated against China for
selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran by suspending the
process under which China had been given increasing access to U.S.
products with advanced technology.
   Since then, China has said it has stopped selling Silkworms to
Iran. A U.S. official, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity,
said ``our information is that they've been living up to that.''
   Still, before resuming liberalization of the high technology
trade, ``we want to be sure we're in sync with the Chinese on what
we're talking about.'' the official said. ``We believe the Chinese
position has been responsive to our concerns, but we want to be
sure that this responsiveness will continue.''
   Although no details of their private talks were disclosed,
Shultz also was expected to discuss with Wu the U.S. proposal for
direct Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Shultz's
talks with Wu were cordial and covered a range of international
issues.
   They said discussions later in the week will focus on human
rights and the Persian Gulf situation.
   Shultz is trying to structure a peace conference in which the
United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France would
serve as sponsors _ but without the power to impose the terms of a
settlement.
   Shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent anti-Chinese
rioting in Tibet. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
between three and nine people are believed to have been killed, and
he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in Tibet.
   He also reiterated the U.S. view that Tibet is an integral part
of China.
   Shultz, discussing shared interests of the two countries, said
both have opposed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the
Vietnamese military intervention in Cambodia.
   ``The United States is convinced that a secure China is in the
interest not only of China but of the U.S. and the states of the
East Asian region,'' Shultz said.
   Wu, in turn, said there is great potential for continued
development of U.S.-Chinese relations, ``yet there are also
obstacles and difficulties.
   ``Therefore, our two sides have no reason to rest content with
the present status,'' he said.
   Wu also met with Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci on Monday.
He will meet with President Reagan on Tuesday.

   The Soviet Union on Monday sought an
urgent Security Council meeting to demand an end to the Iran-Iraq
``war of the cities,'' and the United States insisted anew on an
arms embargo against Iran.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov told reporters he
expected a meeting of the 15-member council by Wednesday. He said
the Soviets will introduce a resolution demanding an end to the
devastating missile bombardment of both capitals.
   Moscow, however, has been reluctant to push for a punitive arms
embargo against Iran for delay in complying with a cease-fire as
demanded by the council last July 20. The Soviets have been
improving relations with Tehran.
   Belonogov said his government favors more time for diplomacy
before imposing a weapons ban against Iran or Iraq.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman on
Monday urged the council to act quickly on an arms embargo
resolution.
   Iran meanwhile demanded that the council condemn Iraq for
starting the deadly war of the cities now in its second week.
   Both sides claim the strikes on Tehran and Baghdad are defensive
and retaliatory. Both are believed to be using Soviet-made missiles
in the missile attacks, the most intense in the 7{-year-old war.
   As the council met behind closed doors to discuss the missile
strikes, Iran's attempt to stave off an embargo with an ambiguous
note to the council appeared to have failed.
   The ``undated, unsigned scrap of paper'' does not ``constitute a
clear acceptance'' of Security Council Resolution 598, British
Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell said Monday. ``If they accept, they
should say so _ loudly, clearly and unequivocally.''
   Redman said the United States sees nothing new in the
``non-paper'' and ``very much doubts that anyone else does either.''
   He told reporters that in pursuing the arms embargo, ``We are
continuing active consultations with other council members to
achieve consensus on this resolution, which we are convinced would
help bring the gulf war to an end.'' The unsigned note handed by
Iran's U.N. envoy to the Security Council president last week
claims a Feb. 28 letter from Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Albar
Velayati constituted acceptance of the council's cease-fire
resolution.
   The letter, however, did not say Iran endorsed the resolution.
   ``We also note that several Iranian spokesmen have issued
statements over the past few days disavowing the non-paper released
in New York,'' Redman noted.
   The agreement of all five permanent council members _ the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ is needed to
pass an arms embargo resolution. Each has a veto. Washington has
said the stumbling block is the Soviet Union.
   Redman said Secretary of State George Shultz would probably
raise the issue in talks with Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian of China
this week.
   The Soviets are close allies of Iraq but have also been trying
to improve relations with neighboring Iran.
   Crowds in Tehran, angered at being the target of Soviet-made
missiles, tried to storm the Soviet Embassy over the weekend.
Belonogov denied that ``the defensive weapons now used against
Tehran and other cities'' are Soviet-made.
   He also urged Iran and Iraq to stop the attacks and described
the escalation in the war of the cities as a major development in
the gulf conflict.
   ``We consider this as just not another espisode in the war ...
We think that the war between cities adds some new dimension to the
protracted military conflict between the two neighboring
countries,'' he said.
   Belonogov said he met Monday with Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar and with the president of the Security Council this
month, Yugoslav Ambassador Dragoslav Pejic, and urged them ``in the
most energetic terms'' to try to persuade Iran and Iraq to stop the
missile attacks.
   ``The position of my country is clear. We are for the soonest
possible political resolution of the war conflict between Iran and
Iraq and for the speediest possible implementation of the Security
Council Resolution 598.''

   A group of U.S.
representatives sent a scathing letter to President P.W. Botha to
express ``outrage and dismay'' over the slaying of a black activist.
   Seven U.S. senators signed a similar letter to Piet Koornhof,
South Africa's ambassador to the United States, that also protested
the Jan. 24 slaying of Godfry Sicelo Dhlomo, 18.
   Dhlomo, an anti-apartheid activist, was killed four days after
police questioned him about his appearance in foreign television
documentaries, including a CBS documentary, ``Children of
Apartheid.''
   ``We the undersigned members of the U.S. Congress are writing to
express our outrage and dismay at the assassination of Godfrey
Sicelo Dhlomo,'' said the letter, signed by 31 House members and
obtained by The Associated Press on Monday.
   ``He is one of more than two dozen anti-apartheid activists
killed in mysterious circumstances since 1980,'' it said. ``None of
these killings have been solved by the police, lending allegations
of official involvement greater credibility.
   ``Physical evidence attests to the fact that Mr. Dhlomo was
beaten and tortured, and it is common knowledge that intimidation
and threats are everyday tools of the South African Security Police.
   ``A South Africa in flames will be the inevitable result of your
government's failure to reform security police tactics and work
toward a democratic society. We strongly urge a prompt and thorough
investigation into Mr. Dhlomo's death and other apartheid-related
crimes.''
   Some of the House members who signed the Feb. 11 letter will
participate in hearings on South Africa beginning March 15. The
letter to Botha was initiated by Cardiss Collins, D-Ill.
   Police arrested Dhlomo during a raid on the Johannesburg offices
of a civil rights organization on Jan. 20 and questioned him about
his statements in several foreign news films.
   After his body was found near his parents' home in Soweto,
several anti-apartheid groups said they suspected police
involvement. The police have denied involvement and have offered a
$2,500 reward for the arrest of the killer or killers.
   The letter signed by the Senate members, written by Sen. Barbara
A. Mikulski, D-Md., said: ``We have a very strong interest in
Sicelo and require your government to allow an independent body to
investigate the circumstances under which he was murdered.''
   The House letter addressed Botha as prime minister, a post he
has not held since 1984 when he became president under a new
constitution.

<HEAD>Briton Begins Begins Military Maneuvers In Falklands</HEAD>

   Britain began a 25-day military exercise Monday to
test its ability to protect the Falkland Islands from invasion, the
Defense Ministry reported. Argentina said its forces would be on
``defensive alert.''
   ``At this stage, it's very much a paper exercise,'' a ministry
spokesman said. ``The exercise will start with intelligence reports
that an enemy is raising the threat level. They will play out a
scenario.''
   An infantry batallion of 600-1,000 soldiers based in Britain
will fly to the South Atlantic archipelago March 17-18, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Argentina claims the islands off its coast, which it calls the
Malvinas, and invaded them in April 1982. Britain sent a naval task
force and won a 74-day war that killed 712 Argentines and 258
Britons.
   Britain says the exercise, called Fire Focus, is purely
defensive. One of its functions will be to test a new $690 million
airport built since the war.
   Ian Stewart, the armed forces minister, said criticism of the
exercise from Argentina and other Latin American nations resulted
from misunderstanding of its size.
   ``I do not see how something which is purely a defensive
exercise can be seen as provocative,'' he said.
   ``We have to defend the Falklands. We had a very unfortunate
experience six years ago. We not only have a right to have a
defensive garrison in the Falklands, we have a responsibility to do
so.''
   The exercise, scheduled to end March 31, is the largest since
the war and the first with reinforcements flown from Britain.
Military units could not be airlifted in 1982 because the airport
was inadequate, and the naval force took weeks to reach the islands.
   Argentina says the islands are part of its inheritance from
Spanish colonial rule and claims Britain stole them in 1833.
   Britain has refused to discuss sovereignty, declaring that the
1,900 Falkland Islanders prefer to remain British, but Stewart
said: ``In other respects we would like to have more normal
relations with Argentina.''

<TEXT>
   Navy chief Jose Toribio Merino said
Monday the nation's military commanders will select in June or July
the candidate for a yes-or-no presidential vote later this year.
   It was the first time a time frame has been set for the
nomination of the presidential candidate. No date has been set for
the election.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the general who has ruled Chile
since the 1973 coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist
President Salvador Allende, has given every indication he will seek
the nomination.
   As the powerful army commander, the 72-year-old Pinochet will be
among the four military chieftains selecting the candidate for an
eight-year term.
   Merino spoke with reporters after a meeting of the law-making,
four-member junta that he heads.
   He said the presidential election ``has to take place during the
second half'' of this year.
   According to the 1980 constitution drafted by the armed forces,
Chile's president for the 1989-97 term will be chosen in a
yes-or-no plebiscite on a single candidate.
   The candidate will be named by the commanders of the army, navy,
air force and national police.
   If the military-picked candidate is rejected by the voters, an
open presidential election must be called in 1990 with Pinochet
remaining in power until then, according to the constitution.

   Democrats Richard Gephardt and Albert Gore Jr.
are in a battle of their own in Tuesday's Southern primaries,
competing for the same voters and harboring hopes of knocking each
other out of the presidential race.
   With Jesse Jackson poised to collect the South's considerable
black vote, and Michael Dukakis scoring with Southern liberals,
Gephardt and Gore are both vying for what's left: the moderate and
conservative, blue-collar and middle-income white voters.
   Acknowledging Dukakis may do very well Tuesday, each would like
to emerge as the white alternative to the Massachusetts governor.
And each would like to move on to the next round of contests
without the other, trying to draw a bead on Dukakis.
   Both Gore and Gephardt have scaled back Southern expectations as
their initial strategies have not been fulfilled.
   Gephardt concentrated on the early Iowa contest, hoping it would
propel him. But his victory there hasn't provided momentum in the
South. Gore played on regional appeal, but that hasn't been enough
in a field fractured by so many candidates.
   The result: Each needs to beat the other to continue.
   ``There are two Gs in this race and only one G is going North,''
said one source close to Gore's campaign, insisting on anonymity.
   Gephardt's tough foreign trade-retaliation message and the
powerful television commercials that helped him in South Dakota and
Iowa have been overwhelmed by the enormity of campaigning in the 20
states of Super Tuesday.
   He has spent about $1.2 million on television _ and has been
outspent three-to-one by both Gore and Dukakis.
   Gore has been pummeling Gephardt in tough negative television
commercials that the Gephardt campaign acknowledges has been
effective against their candidate. Gore has branded Gephardt a
``phony flip-flopper.''
   Dukakis also has slammed Gephardt with television ads that
depict him as a flip-flopper on issues.
   ``We have been pinned down in a very tough negative crossfire
between Dukakis and Gore,'' said Gephardt polltaker Ed Reilly.
``They have gone to any areas we have strengths, especially Gore,
and just beat the ... out of us. That's effective ... but I think
the net effect is going to be to drive (voter) turnout down, very
very low.''
   Gore has run ads attacking Dukakis and Jackson, too, but the
main focus of the television attack has been on Gephardt.
   ``Ideally for the Gore campaign, we would like to _ and we
expect to _ narrow the field by eliminating Dick Gephardt, thereby
creating a situation where Senator Gore can focus clearly on
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson,'' said Gore spokesman Arlie
Schardt.
   An ABC News poll of the South released Monday night said that
``the biggest loser on Super Tuesday will probably be Richard
Gephardt, who is leading only in his home state of Missouri and
could drop below the 15 percent threshold for delegates'' in 12 of
16 states polled.
   Both Gore and Gephardt are focusing on the delegate count coming
out of Super Tuesday rather than the number of states won. Neither
predicts an outright win in the biggest states of Florida and
Texas, but they hope to collect a big share of delegates there.
   Gore forces believe if they can push Gephardt into a
fourth-place finish in delegates, and hold him to winning little
more than his home state of Missouri, he will be staggered and
unable to continue. Gephardt forces scoff at that notion.
   ``They're not going to knock us out,'' said Reilly. ``No way ...
it's absurd.''
   But both Gephardt and Gore face the prospect of leaving the
South impoverished and facing, in Dukakis if he wins Florida and
Texas, a candidate who has demonstrated national appeal.
   Gore took out a $1 million line of credit to saturate Southern
television. Gephardt faced a financial squeeze going into the South
that limited his ability to run the ads that proved effective
elsewhere, including his vow that unless South Korea opened its
markets he'd put so many taxes on their products a Hyundai
automobile would cost $48,000.
   Noting that ad, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said: ``The
Hyundai may very well run out of gas on Tuesday night.''

   Gallaudet University students vowed Monday to
keep their campus closed indefinitely after the school's board of
trustees reaffirmed its selection of a hearing presdent to head the
nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf.
   ``We're going to keep the school closed,'' said student leader
Jerry Covell. ``We will stop when we get a deaf president.''
   Covell and around 1,800 of the school's 2,200 students protested
at the Capitol after board of trustees chairman Jane Basset Spilman
told the students the board would not reconsider its decision to
hire Elizabeth Ann Zinser as Gallaudet's next president.
   The selection of Zinser, an administrator at the University of
North Carolina at Greensboro, was the product of a ``careful,
reasoned'' search process, Spilman said.
   ``A lawful, proper and final decision was made,'' she said.
   As Spilman made her announcement in the school's field house,
students listening there spilled out into the street and began a
one-mile walk to the Capitol.
   Spilman and several other board members listened for about 30
minutes to complaints from the 100 or so students, then left
without speaking to reporters.
   Gallaudet, the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf,
was created by an act of Congress in 1864, and relies on federal
funding for most of its operating budget. In fiscal year 1988,
Gallaudet received $62 million from Congress.
   ``We're trying to put some pressure on Congress, to get them to
put some pressure on our board,'' said Covell, a 23-year-old
Frederick, Md., resident. ``After this, we'll march to the White
House.''
   Monday's protest capped a week of demonstrations in which
students tried to convince the board of trustees to hire a deaf
person as the school's seventh president.
   After Spilman announced Sunday that Zinser had won out over two
deaf finalists, students walked to the hotel where the board was
meeting, then continued their protest at the Capitol. Monday,
students gathered before dawn and blocked all entrances to the
campus, forcing officials to cancel classes for the day.
   A committee of 10 students, two faculty members and two staff
members told the trustees that they wanted Zinser replaced with a
deaf president, the resignation of Spilman, and assurances that
deaf people would constitute a majority of the school's 20-member
board within three years.
   The student group and the trustees met for around three hours on
the northeast Washington campus before Spilman announced that the
decision made the day before would stand.
   ``I do not think I will ever experience a more frustrating
feeling in my life,'' said Frank R. Turk, the school's dean of
student life, who is deaf. ``I have been on the Gallaudet payroll
for 35 years, and I have never felt so defeated.''
   Spilman said Zinser was selected because she is a ``top caliber
academician'' who also has the administrative and fund-raising
skills the school was looking for.
   Deaf students claim that only a deaf person can truly understand
their educational needs.
   Zinser said she understood the students' frustration.
   ``I feel considerable empathy and compassion for the students,''
Zinser said by telephone from her Greensboro office. ``I hope to
speak with them soon, but given the intensity of this situation,
it's only right for me to maintain some distance.''
   Students had expressed outrage that Zinser does not speak sign
language, but the incoming president vowed to accelerate
immediately her study of the language.
   ``I have a facility for learning it, and now that I have been
hired, I plan to have an intensive training program.''
   Spilman said that Zinser was selected bu a 10-4 margin, with the
three deaf members and one hearing member of the trustees'
selection committee voting for one of the two deaf candidates.
   Philip W. Bravin, a deaf trustee who headed the search
committee, said he and the committee's other deaf members lobbied
to no avail for a deaf president.
   ``Your expressions outline exactly what we put on the table,''
Bravin, an IBM executive, told the students who remained on campus
after Spilman's announcement. ``We did the best we could do.''
   Bravin asserted that the two other finalists for the post _ I.
King Jordan, Gallaudet's dean of the college of arts and sciences,
and Harvey J. Corson, superintendent of the Louisiana School for
the Deaf, in Baton Rouge, La. _ both were qualified to be
Gallaudet's next president.
   ``No candidate has the perfect criteria, and they both were
qualified. I think the committee's decision speaks for itself.''

   Jury selection began Monday in a
trial of a Taiwanese gangster accused of killing a Chinese-American
journalist openly critical of the Taiwanese government.
   Tung Kuei-sen has pleaded innocent in the 1984 shooting of Henry
Liu at the writer's Daly City home.
   The plea puzzled his attorney, since the 35-year-old Tung
testified two years ago in a New York drug trial that he and a
fellow member of Taiwan's largest criminal syndicate, the United
Bamboo gang, gunned down Liu on government orders relayed by gang
chief Chen Chi-Li.
   ``I suspect he just wants to tell the jury and everyone else his
story,'' said defense attorney Douglas Gray. ``He thought he was
doing his government's bidding ... and he was left twisting slowly,
slowly in the wind.''
   Prosecutor Robert Bishop said he expects the trial before San
Mateo County Superior Court Judge Margaret Kemp to last two weeks
and he will call up to 18 witnesses. Gray said he was unsure how he
would present his case.
   Tung faces one count of murder and one special allegation that
he used a gun in the Oct. 15, 1984, slaying. If convicted, he could
face 27 years to life in prison.
   Tung was convicted of heroin smuggling after a federal trial in
New York in 1986 and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
   Liu, a long-term critic of the Taiwanese government, was a
columnist for a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco and had
just published a book that attacked the island nation's ruling
party when he was killed.
   The U.S. Congress and the State Department condemned Liu's
murder and House hearings were held to look into the murky
circumstances surrounding it.
   Chen has blamed the killing on Taiwan's former chief of military
intelligence, Vice Admiral Wang Shi-ling, who said he only directed
that Liu be taught ``a lesson.''
   Both Chen and Wang are serving life sentences in Taiwan after
being convicted in the killing in a Taiwanese military court. Two
intelligence officials who served under Wang are serving lesser
terms.
   Wu Tun, 35, the second gunman, is serving a life term for the
killing in a Taiwan prison.

   A 300-pound bear that mauled a 2-year-old
boy in a shopping mall was under quarantine Monday, as federal
investigators began a probe into the animal's keepers, authorities
said.
   Kevin E. Kuhn of Galion was listed in fair condition at
Children's Hospital with deep cuts to his scalp and face that
required more than 100 stitches, officials said.
   He was attacked Saturday while posing with the Himalayan bear,
named Fluffy, after a children's performance at a shopping mall in
Mansfield, about 60 miles north of Columbus.
   The bear was held at an undisclosed location, said Joe Evans,
director of environmental health services for the Richland County
Health Department. The bear's owners had not sought return of the
animal, and Evans indicated the county would resist any efforts to
return the bear.
   ``We will fight that, if necessary,'' he said. ``We have had
some contact with the owners and indicated our intent ... to take
over custody of the animal until we can find a more permanent
disposition.''
   The county might seek to destroy the animal, but that has not
been determined, he said.
   U.S. Department of Agriculture investigators arrived in
Mansfield on Monday to look into the attack, police Capt. John
Arcudi said. Owners of exotic animals must register with the
Agriculture Department.
   ``At this time, I don't know what criminal charges could be
filed,'' Arcudi said. ``It's more civil than criminal.''
   Fluffy is one of four bears featured in the ``Goldilocks and Her
Bears'' shopping-center attraction. A bear named Fluffy in the same
troupe clawed a Jacksonville, Fla., 4-year-old during a show last
month, police said.
   That child required at least six stiches, police said, and the
bear was quarantined five days before being released to its owner,
Walter Naghtin Sr., 54, of Tampa, Fla.
   It was unclear whether the same bear was involved in both
attacks, authorities said.
   In the Jacksonville case, Naghtin and his son, Walter Naghtin
Jr., were charged for allowing wild animals to perform without a
permit, police said. They pleaded guilty and were fined and
sentenced to six months' probation.
   Permits were obtained for the Mansfield performance, police said.
   Efforts to reach the Naghtins Monday were unsuccessful. Ruth
Naghtin of Northbrook, Ill., who identified herself as the mother
of the elder Naghtin, said she did not know where they were.

   The man whose attempted murder conviction
led to the book and television movie ``Deadly Intentions'' was
sentenced to 15 years in prison Monday on federal marijuana and
weapons charges.
   The sentence was handed down after a prosecutor alleged that the
defendant, former doctor Patrick Henry, planned to use blood serum
containing the AIDS virus in a revenge scheme and planned to kill a
former federal prosecutor.
   U.S. District Judge Emmett Cox imposed the sentence and ordered
Henry sent to a prison where he could receive psychiatric treatment.
   In an appeal for mercy, Henry, 40, said he ``got discouraged''
in prison after his 1979 conviction and ``picked up some bad
attitudes.'' While in prison, Henry wrote ``The Outlaw's Bible,''
under the pen name E.X. Boozhie. Prosecutors said the book
instructs readers on how to avoid arrest.
   Henry served 6{ years of a 15-year sentence in an Arizona prison
for the attempted murder of his first wife, Christine. He moved to
Mobile in an attempt to regain his medical license.
   ``Judge, I don't know if you believe a man can change,'' Henry
said. ``I'm going to do my best.''
   His current wife, Nancy, turned to authorities when she
discovered an ammunition box concealed in their home that contained
an assortment of materials, including manuals on explosives and
false identities.
   Henry was convicted Jan. 21 of possessing a pistol after being
convicted of a felony, and scheming to distribute marijuana to
prisoners in Arizona where he had served time.
   U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions told the judge Monday that Henry
planned to use the pistol and a bomb to ``blow up the U.S.
Attorney's office'' in Tucson. Neither the pistol nor the bomb were
introduced as evidence in the trial.
   Sessions said the ammunition box also contained two vials of
blood serum containing the AIDS virus. He said the virus was
confirmed by testing at the Department of Defense laboratory in
Washington.
   FBI spokesman Gene Eason said authorities could only surmise how
Henry planned to use the AIDS virus. He said the serum apparently
was collected while Henry worked at a Mobile doctor's office while
attempting to recover his professional license as a dermatologist.
   ``My view is simply this, the evidence indicates very strongly
this defendant would like to pose a danger to the witnesses in this
trial and the trial 10 years ago,'' Sessions said.
   Defense attorney Jim Byrd told the judge the government had
pursued Henry because of a ``spiteful, neurotic suicidal wife'' who
lied during his trial.
   ``Pat's life has been dissected by the FBI and agents of the
U.S. government,'' Byrd said. He said Henry had a constitutional
right to possess books on bombs, marijuana growing, scorpions, and
identity manuals.
   ``There was never any threat of blowing up the U.S. attorney's
office or any other target,'' Byrd said. ``Pat is an electronics
hobbyist. None of these materials pertained to a detonating
device.''
   Byrd said Sessions' version of the case was ``fantasies of a
suspicious mind.''
   Sessions argued that Henry planned to return to Arizona and kill
former U.S. Attorney Randy Stevens, who co-wrote the book ``Deadly
Intentions.''
   The movie starred Michael Biehn as a promising young physician
who terrorized his wife after his violent, schizophrenic
personality emerged. He was arrested for plotting to kill his wife
after she divorced him.
   A photograph of Stevens also was in Henry's ammo box, Sessions
said.

   An Army private who was piloting an airplane
that came close to President Reagan's helicopter last year over
Southern California was ordered to spend 30 weekends in jail Monday
for making false statements about the incident.
   Ralph William Myers, 33, of Fort Lewis, Wash., was convicted of
lying to authorities about the reason he strayed into prohibited
airspace in his rented plane Aug. 13, 1987, at the same time the
president was heading to his hilltop ranch north of Santa Barbara.
   Despite a Probation Department recommendation of probation, U.S.
District Judge Manuel L. Real sentenced Myers to three years in
jail for each of two counts of making false statements. Real then
suspended all but 60 days of the jail time.
   In addition to the suspended sentence and five years' probation,
the judge ordered Myers to donate 1,000 hours to charitable service.
   Myers' jail time will begin April 9 and is not to interfere with
his military service, the judge said. The maximum sentence Myers
could have received was 10 years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
   Myers told the judge he ``cannot justify or condone statements I
made last August. I apologize to the government agencies involved.''
   Outside the courtroom, Myers said he was a scapegoat for federal
government mishandling of his aircraft. ``I haven't gotten a fair
trial since day one because of the hysteria surrounding the near
miss of Marine One,'' he said. ``There was not a near miss.''
   According to the president's Marine pilot, Lt. Col. Michael
Glynn, Myers' plane came passed about 200 feet in front of the
helicopter and 150 feet below it. Myers maintains his plane was no
closer than 800 to 1,000 feet from Marine One.
   His attorney, Manuel Araujo, said they will appeal the sentence.
   Myers was demoted a private's pay grade for being AWOL. He still
has 18 months left to serve in the U.S. Army.
   Myers, and a passenger, Oregon businessman Harlan Lee Jones,
were arrested at John Wayne Airport in Orange County. Marine
helicopters, which had been escorting the president's Marine One,
chased the Piper Cherokee to the airport, but authorities said
Myers seemed unaware that he was being followed.
   Myers told Secret Service and Federal Aviation Administration
agents he was looking for a lost contact lens in the airplane's
cabin when he strayed into the prohibited airspace. He also claimed
he was unaware the airspace was restricted.
   A day later, he admitted he had lied about the lens.
   Myers, who had been absent without leave from the Army since
Aug. 3, 1987, said he lied because he was confused about the entire
situation. ``I was trying to stay out of more trouble,'' he
explained in court documents.

   The breast of chicken was cooked to perfection
and the trappings in the State Department's elegant eighth-floor
dining room reflected painstaking effort.
   All seemed in order Monday when Secretary of State George P.
Shultz hosted a luncheon for Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian
except for one apparent gaffe in protocol _ the silverware was from
Taiwan.
   There was no indication that Wu or any member of his delegation
noted the word ``Taiwan'' etched on the bottom of the utensils.
   The claim of the Taiwanese government to be the official
representative of the Chinese people has been a sore point with the
mainland for almost four decades.
   The lapse evoked memories a similar mishap in 1975 when
President Gerald R. Ford, on a visit to Beijing, hosted a dinner
for Chinese officials at the U.S. diplomatic mission in China.
   The chop sticks were from Taiwan.

   Raymond and Michele L'Esperance took
three of their quintuplet babies home from the hospital Monday,
saying they were eager to begin family life with the in-vitro
infants.
   Raymond Jr., Danielle and Erica L'Esperance and their parents
rode away from William Beaumont Hospital in a white limousine
decorated with silver balloons as a crowd of doctors, nurses,
hospital administrators and reporters watched.
   The babies, born Jan. 11, were the first quintuplets born in the
United States after being conceived through in-vitro fertilization,
which involves fertilizing ovum in the laboratory and implanting
the embryos in the womb.
   The other two babies, Veronica and Alexandria, who were placed
on respirators at birth, remain in the hospital. They are off the
respirators now and are expected to be released in a few weeks,
said Dr. Daniel Batton, director of newborn medicine at Beaumont.
   ``They still require special attention and monitoring,'' Batton
said. ``But we expect those problems will resolve in the next
couple of weeks, and we don't anticipate any problems.''
   Looking ahead to the task of raising five babies at one time,
the couple said they are ready to take the infants to their new
house in Clarkston and let them join their three other children as
a family.
   ``We are pleased and overjoyed to have three of our babies going
home,'' said L'Esperance, a corrections officer with the Macomb
County Sheriff's Department.
   ``We can't wait to have the other two home. We'll just start
getting down to being a family.''
   The babies that left the hospital have gained about 3 pounds
each in the eight weeks since their birth. Raymond left Beaumont
weighing 4 pounds, 9 ounces; Danielle weighed 6 pounds, 6 ounces;
and Erica weighed 5 pounds, 14 ounces, said Pamela Wells, nursing
director in the in-vitro fertilization program at Beaumont.

<HEAD>Court Allows Regional Bells To Offer Computerized Message
Transmissions</HEAD>

continues to forbid publishing of yellow pages, but not white pages

   A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for
the regional Bell telephone companies to offer certain new
computerized information services, including voice storage and
electronic mail.
   But U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, in a 66-page decision,
refused to retreat from an earlier decision in which he said phone
companies could transmit information but could not generate or
manipulate the content of the information.
   ``It is the court's expectation that this easing of the
information services restriction will avoid anticompetitive
effects, and that it will at the same time bring this nation closer
to the enjoyment of the full benefits of the information age,''
Greene said in his decision.
   Though Greene's decision lifts the legal barrier to the Bell
companies' offering of the new services, the companies still would
need state and federal regulatory approval before they could
integrate them into their networks.
   Industry experts and Bell company officials say the computer
software for these services has been developed and could be offered
to consumers in some parts of the country within one to two years.
   Voice storage and retrieval services would allow consumers to
rely on the phone network for storing and retrieving messages,
functions now performed by telephone answering machines. Electronic
mail, a service now available in many private phone systems, allows
the computer-to-computer transfer of messages.
   In addition, Greene said the Bell companies can perform certain
computerized ``gateway'' services such as data transmission,
billing management and services that enable different computers to
``speak'' to each other.
   BellSouth and Bell Atlantic said the decision was an important
step toward making a wide range of information services available
to American consumers. But both said the judge did not go far
enough, and Bell Atlantic said it will appeal the decision.
   ``We view this as a start, but only a start. We still are not
allowed to provide content for information services,'' a BellSouth
statement said.
   Bell Atlantic Chairman Thomas E. Bolger said the company is
``particularly concerned'' that Greene is continuing to forbid the
Bell companies from electronic publishing of yellow page phone
directories. Greene's September ruling allowed electronic white
pages, but Bolger said the court's restrictions do not allow ``a
sufficiently flexible and comprehensive'' electronic service for
white pages directory.
   He also said Greene's decision to continue to forbid the Bell
companies from getting into the content side of information
services will delay the delivery of more sophisticated services _
like home banking and shopping _ to most American consumers.
   Joel Gross, a telephone analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette, said the decision was a ``major breakthrough'' for the
regional phone companies. He said that in the long term, ``it will
be a tremendous boon to the industry,'' though in the short-term
will have little effect on the companies' earninings.
   ``Services like this, since they are software-based, should be
high-profit services and voice storage and retrieval will create
new (traffic) volumes for the phone networks,'' he said.
   Gene Kimmelman, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of
America, said the decision means regulation of the industry will
become more important ``to prevent the Bell companies from
overpricing local phone service to finance these new services.''
   Greene, who oversees the antitrust decree that broke up the
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. four years ago, has been
reluctant to allow AT&T's offspring, the Bell companies, to compete
in areas where their control of the local phone networks would put
them at an advantage over competitors.
   Last September, he refused to lift prohibitions on the Baby
Bells that prevent them from making phone equipment or offering
long-distance services. In considering the restrictions on
information services, however, he opened the door slightly.
Monday's ruling details the information-services options now open
to the Bell companies.

<HEAD>Jackson Campaigns In Texas On Eve Of Super Tuesday</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson said Monday he's going into the
Super Tuesday elections as an underdog, but thinks he'll do very
well nonetheless.
   ``I don't have a crystal ball,'' he said when asked how many
delegates he might pick up in the day's balloting.
   Jackson pointed to the ``high-tech, well-financed operation'' of
Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis.
   ``He has money; I have the message and the grass-roots approach.
It will be interesting to see how these concepts play out,'' he
said.
   Jackson made the comments in an interviw aboard his campaign
plane flying from an airport rally in Laredo to a rally at the
University of Houston.
   As he campaigned on the eve of Super Tuesday, Jackson said Texas
has shaped up to a fight between himself and Dukakis. He also
contended his message has become part of the political mainstream.
   ``When one takes a serious look at my positions, they are very
central to the broad-based American point of view,'' he said.
   Earlier, Jackson visited an AIDS clinic in Dallas and told a
rally in Brownsville: ``I'll be your friend in Washington.''
   Jackson pledged to fight against proposals to make English the
official language of the United States.
   ``We are a great nation. We can speak more than one language.
... Two-thirds of the hemisphere speaks Spanish. We should grow and
speak more languages, have broader culture,'' he said.
   Jackson donned a sombrero and the popular Latin-style shirt
called a guayaberra as he addressed the mixed-race outdoor
gathering where several people waved red United Farm Worker flags.
   Jackson recalled his visit to Brownsville of several weeks ago
when he went into the broccoli fields where there are no portable
lavatories for the field workers.
   UFW organizer Juanita Valdez said that Jackson should get a lot
of farm worker support because ``he came to help us.''
   After Jackson's visit, she said, the state health director
called a meeting to find out why the sanitary laws were not being
enforced in the field.
   ``You need a friend in the White House,'' Jackson said. ``I'm
your friend in Brownsville. I'll be your friend in Washington.''
   Jackson was accompanied by former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya,
who addressed the gathering in Spanish, Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower, prominent feminist leader Sissy
Farenthold and Tennessee politician John J. Hooker.
   One man in the crowd, Carlos Martinez, said he was supporting
Jackson because Jackson cares about the Mexican-American problems
and the poor people. Martinez said the once-bustling port of
Brownsville ``is dead'' and that he had been laid off a few years
back from both Marathon and Pyramid oil companies.
   ``We're just about forgotten about down here and the economy is
really bad. We're looking for a change,'' he said.
   Hightower said the Southern region is the second-most depressed
part of Texas after Laredo, where Jackson headed later in the day.
   Earlier he visited with dying men in an AIDS clinic in Dallas.
   Several onlookers said that Jackson and Democratic rival Michael
Dukakis will likely split the Democratic vote in this area.
Dukakis, who speaks fluent Spanish, has been pushing hard for the
Hispanic vote and visited neighboring Harlingen a week ago.
   But county commissioner candidate Gilberto Villarreal, a Jackson
supporter, said, ``Speaking Spanish or marrying a Hispanic does not
give you the heart of a Hispanic.'' He said that while Dukakis has
done ``tremendous work in Massachusetts,'' Jackson has the heart of
a Hispanic. ``He came up from the grass roots. He has not forgotten
what it is to be poor,'' he said.

   Arizona's top police official testified at
Gov. Evan Mecham's impeachment trial Monday that he realized almost
immediately Mecham had committed a crime in ordering the official
to not cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat.
   ``I was in shock over what he was saying, taken aback,
speechless,'' said Col. Ralph Milstead, director of the state
Department of Public Safety.
   Milstead quoted Mecham as angrily telling him: ``I don't want
you to help the attorney general hang me. Don't tell him anything.''
   Milstead said he had phoned the governor Nov. 15 to discuss a
report that Lee Watkins, then a Mecham administration official, had
threatened to send a former Mecham aide on ``a long boat ride'' if
she didn't stop testifying before a grand jury investigating Mecham
campaign finances.
   Watkins has denied threatening the aide, Donna Carlson. And
Milstead has said he cooperated with the attorney general's office.
   Milstead, whose testimony is crucial to the obstruction of
justice charge against the governor, blurted out his statement
regarding a crime during cross-examination by Mecham's attorney,
Fred Craft.
   Craft asked why Milstead, in his report on the incident, quoted
the governor's words but not Milstead's own part of the
conversation.
   ``Because I'm not committing a crime,'' said Milstead. ``... I'm
not obstructing justice.''
   ``When did you conclude that the governor's words constituted a
crime?'' asked Craft.
   ``As I'm hearing them and reflecting on them,'' said Milstead,
adding it took him ``about two seconds'' after hanging up the phone.
   Craft asked Milstead why he did not write down his conclusion
that a crime had been committed.
   ``I didn't think it was necessary,'' said Milstead. ``Anyone
with a legal background could read it and see this was an
obstruction of an investigation.''
   Craft kept Milstead on cross-examination for most of the day and
said he would continue quizzing him Tuesday. Senate Democratic
Minority Leader Alan Stephens told reporters the senators were
growing restless and had requested that Craft be asked to conclude.
   ``It's difficult for us to listen to what many of us consider
repetitious quetions,'' he said. ``If that's what they do in a
court of law, I'm glad I'm not a lawyer.''
   At one point, Craft asked if Milstead was surprised that his
staff didn't tell him the governor had assigned a member of his
Cabinet, Max Hawkins, to investigate the death threat allegation.
   ``No, it didn't surprise me,'' said Milstead. ``Max Hawkins is
not a law enforcement officer. He's not competent to investigate
it. Lee Watkins works for him, and Max Hawkins wouldn't be taken
seriously anywhere on earth that I know of.''
   Hawkins, former head of the Department of Administration, was
fired last week by acting Gov. Rose Mofford, who said he had
publicly attacked government officials.
   Milstead, the trial's seventh witness, took the stand at the
start of the second week of testimony. Mecham, the first U.S.
governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, has not
attended the proceedings yet.
   Mecham, 63, a first-term Republican, is accused in the
impeachment proceedings of obstructing the attorney general's
investigation of the alleged death threat through his orders to
Milstead.
   Mecham, in testimony before a House impeachment committee in
January, acknowledged that he may have told Milstead not to
cooperate with the investigation. However, Mecham contended he was
not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation before
his conversation with Milstead.
   The governor also is accused in 23 articles of impeachment of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 in a state
fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Mecham also faces a recall election May 17 and a criminal trial
March 22 on felony charges accusing him of concealing the $350,000
loan.
   Milstead described a tense, angry, fearful Mecham trying to
minimize the alleged threat.
   ``He said this was a family spat and there's nothing to it,''
Milstead testified.
   Milstead said he had called the governor as a courtesy to tell
him he was taking the matter to the attorney general and was
surprised by Mecham's anger.
   ``His reaction was, `Well, if you want my permission to talk to
the attorney general, you can't have it. The answer is no.'''
   At one point, Milstead said he was ``kind of pleading'' and told
Mecham: ``We always cooperate with the attorney general.''
   ``He said, `Never. Don't give them any help.'''
   Earlier in the day, Attorney General Robert Corbin advised the
Senate not to grant immunity to Watkins, who invoked Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination Friday and refused
to testify.
   Corbin confirmed that Watkins is the target of a grand jury
investigation and said it would be inappropriate to immunize him
from possible future prosecution.
   Impeachment trial prosecutor William French said: ``We would be
against giving the likes of Mr. Watkins a bath for all the sins he
has committed.'
   The senators were unanimous in their rejection of immunity.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member senate is required to convict
Mecham. The senators then could take another vote and bar him from
holding state office again.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Monday in the Wedtech Corp.
racketeering case involving Rep. Mario Biaggi, with 48 candidates
being excused and 58 others asked to return.
   Last week, 94 potential jurors were excused for hardship
reasons, leaving 106 who had filled out a 63-item questionnaire
about their feelings and who they might know involved in the case.
   On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Constance Baker Motley
excused 48 candidates based upon their answers while 58 were asked
to return Tuesday, either to be requestioned or to appear for the
first time.
   The jurors will have to decide the fate of Biaggi, his eldest
son, former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon and four
co-defendants, who are accused of turning the Wedtech Corp. into a
``vehicle for making illegal payments to public officials.''
   The seven are charged with participating in a racketeering
enterprise that allegedly looted millions of dollars in stock and
cash from Wedtech, a Bronx defense contractor now in bankruptcy
proceedings.
   All are charged with racketeering and conspiracy, each carrying
a maximum 20-year penalty upon conviction. Biaggi also is accused
of extortion, bribe-receiving, wire fraud, perjury and filing false
tax returns, and the other defendants also face various other
charges.
   Wedtech was a small, Bronx machine shop that grew into a
multimillion- dollar-a-year defense contractor. It rose through a
Small Business Administration program that allowed minority-owned
firms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding.
   A number of federal, state and local inquiries are looking into
allegations of bribery, influence peddling and other wrongdoing.
   Asked about one of his responses to the questionnaire, a
potential juror, Joseph C. Siragusi, told Mrs. Motley he had
problems with the concept of programs set up especially to help
minorities and women.
   When Mrs. Motley further explained the concept to him, Siragusi
said: ``Under that circumstance, I wouldn't consider it unfair.''
   When there were no objections from defense and government
attorneys, Mrs. Motley ruled there was no reason to excuse
Siragusi. He will be reinterviewed Tuesday.
   Raymond Joseph Sullivan, another jury candidate from the Bronx,
was asked if he had stated on the questionnaire that he opposed
programs helping minorities.
   ``Sure did,'' Sullivan said. ``I have four children. I wouldn't
want to see them denied a job.''
   Sullivan was asked to return when court resumes at 9:30 a.m.
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and the
secretary-general of the Organization of American States agreed to
be witnesses at talks between the government and Contra rebels, a
presidential communique said Monday.
   The agreement by Joao Baena Soares, the OAS official, and Obando
y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua, appeared to ease the
way for truce negotiations starting Wednesday in Sapoa, on the
border with Costa Rica about 90 miles from Managua.
   President Daniel Ortega last week said the cardinal was no
longer needed as a mediator in talks with the U.S.-backed rebels.
Obando y Bravo had served as a go-between since last November at
government request.
   The Contras insisted the cardinal be a witness, and the talks
had appeared to be in jeopardy.
   Ortega sent letters this week to Obando y Bravo and Baena Soares
asking them to serve as witnesses, the government's Voice of
Nicaragua radio said Monday.
   No one answered the telephone at the headquarters of the
Washington-based OAS.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero earlier Monday accused the
government of ``preparing a unilateral show'' rather than planning
for the talks.
   In a telephone interview from Miami, Calero complained that the
leftist Sandinistas had not responded to a Contra demand that
Obando y Bravo be present ``as witness, moderator and guarantor of
the talks.''
   Ortega said last week that the three days of talks would be
headed by his brother, Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and
one of nine members on the ruling National Directorate. Acceding to
a Contra demand, he said the talks would be held in Nicaragua and
suggested the Sapoa site.
   The Contras accepted and named Calero to head their delegation,
but said the cardinal must attend.
   Calero said the Contras received no word from the government
about security arrangements or the agenda.
   The government says the talks should center on laying down arms
as outlined in the regional peace plan signed last August by the
presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Honduras.
   The rebels want a proposal outlined by the cardinal last month
to be included.
   His agenda called for the government to grant total amnesty to
political prisoners, review a mandatory military draft law, allow
full press freedom and renew a dialogue with its internal
opposition. In return, Contras were to accept a 30-day cease-fire.
   ``We haven't received any response to our position of last
Thursday ... which included these items,'' Calero said.
   ``We said clearly then that we accept the high-level meeting to
discuss the cardinal's agenda and that we had agreed with the
preliminary details of the meeting, but we haven't had a response
from the Sandinista government,'' he said.

   An attorney experienced at representing the
families of deceased astronauts said the settlement negotiated by
the government for four Challenger families was ``woefully
inadequate.''
   Ronald D. Krist, a Houston attorney who represented astronauts'
survivors from the Apollo fire in 1967 as well as three families
from the 1986 space shuttle disaster, said the four Challenger
families should have received more money and would have if they had
had formal legal representation.
   The families, according to documents released Monday, are
dividing the proceeds from annuities and lump sums that cost a
total of $7.735 million. Payments from the annuities will be
extended over years and may amount to much more than the actual
cost. The settlement was negotiated for the families by the
Department of Justice. Morton Thiokol Inc., manufacturer of the
rocket blamed for the Challenger accident, paid 60 percent of the
settlement and the U.S. government paid the rest.
   ``If they're happy, I'm happy for them,'' Krist said of the four
families that settled without filing lawsuits. ``But I would never
have put my stamp of approval for a settlement at the level that
they received.
   ``They would have netted more money if they had been adequately
represented,'' Krist added.
   Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after it
was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Seven
astronauts, including New Hampshire school teacher Christa
McAuliffe, died in the accident.
   McAuliffe's husband, along with the wives of Challenger
commander Dick Scobee, mission specialist Ellison Onizuka and
engineer Bruce Jarvis all settled through the Justice Department
negotiations.
   However, the widow of mission specialist Ron McNair, the father
of Jarvis, and the mother of mission specialist Judy Resnik all
hired Krist to file separate suits only against Thiokol. The suits
were settled out of court, but Krist said he was under court order
to not discuss how much was paid.
   But he was blunt about the government-negotiated settlement.
   ``That settlement is woefully inadequate,'' he said. ``I'm
suggesting that if I was representing them, I would not have
allowed any of them to settle for the amount they received of less
than $2 million a piece (per family).''
   However, Betty Grissom, whose husband Gus died in an Apollo
spacecraft fire in 1967, said, ``It sounds like they did OK.''
   Mrs. Grissom said she received only $350,000, and she had to sue
on her own for that. The government, she said, ``didn't care'' and
never attempted to help her or the widows of two other astronauts
who died in the Apollo fire.
   ``I never heard from the Justice Department,'' she said. ``I
thought we got an injustice done to us. I feel like we got taken.
They act like they care now, but they didn't back then.
   ``It kinda hurts,'' she added. ``It stings that ... we never got
treated like that. It hurts when I think that they're getting that
much money.''
   Michael D. Oldak, a Washington lawyer and ex-husband of
astronaut Judith A. Resnik, said the documents confirm for him that
Resnik family was treated unfairly by the government in settlement
negotiations.
   Resnik's father, Marvin, and her estate were initially involved
in settlement negotiations with the government, said Oldak, who
represented the Resniks.
   He said the government made two offers, but neither were
accepted. Oldak said that because Resnik was single and childless,
and because the government's compensation formula was weighted
heavily toward surviving spouses and children, the offer to
Resnik's survivors was ``a quarter to a half of what they were
offering the other families.''
   The government has declined to contribute anything to any of the
families outside the four it negotiated settlements with.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown said the government had made
settlement offers to attorneys for the Resniks, Smiths and McNairs
based on the same formula used for the other families. These were
rejected, she said.
   After the rejections, the families either negotiated directly
with Morton Thiokol, or filed suits or claims against the company
or the government. Miss Brown said the government would not
negotiate further with the three non-settling families because it
would not enter a settlement separate from one with Morton Thiokol
or which exceeded the guidelines used in the other settlements.
   Judy Resnik's father and her estate recently settled privately
with Morton Thiokol for a sum that Marvin Resnik said it was
between $2 million and $3.5 million.
   Oldak declined to confirm the amount, but he said, ``In
hindsight, it was a good decision not to be part of the
(government-negotiated) settlement.''
   One lawsuit, filed by Jane Smith, widow of Challenger pilot
Michael Smith, remains to be settled. Mrs. Smith did not
participate in the government-negotiated settlement and a court
ruled she could not sue the government. But she is suing Thiokol.
   Mrs. Smith declined to come to the telephone when her Houston
home was called on Monday.

   The judicial misconduct hearing of a former
Vermont Supreme Court justice began with a delay Monday as
attorneys for a key figure in the case argued she should not have
to testify.
   Attorneys for former Chittenden County Assistant Judge Jane
Wheel told the Judicial Conduct Board that her criminal case would
be damaged if she testified in the separate case of her friend and
former co-worker, Justice William Hill.
   Hill was one of three Supreme Court justices accused of allowing
their personal relationships with Wheel to interfere with their
judicial duties.
   The charges filed in January 1987 by the state Judicial Conduct
Board named Hill, Thomas Hayes and Ernest Gibson III. Hill has
retired since the charges were filed. Hayes has died and the
charges against Gibson were dropped and he remains on the court.
   The scandal threw the state's highest court into turmoil. The
justices refused Gov. Madeleine Kunin's request that they step
aside, but they did disqualify themselves from all cases involving
people connected with the case.
   The complaint alleged that the three used their clout to help
Wheel, whether it was in minor matters, like writing memos
endorsing suggestions she made, or major matters, like advising her
while she was under criminal investigation by the state attorney
general's office for allegedly padding her paycheck.
   Wheel was convicted on three counts of false swearing during a
jury trial last month. She was accused of lying during an inquest
into allegations that she submitted false pay vouchers.
   Wheel appeared in court briefly Monday. But she left after she
and her attorneys were given one day to submit memoranda on why she
shouldn't have to testify.
   Hill's attorney, Michael Marks, had said he and his client
welcomed the misconduct hearing, calling it Hill's opportunity to
defend himself publicly.
   But most of the first day's testimony centered on Wheel and her
activities as an assistant judge.
   In Hill's written responses to the board's original charges, he
said his relationship with Wheel was strictly professional and did
not go beyond ``the amicable relationship expected of judges who
work together.''
   But the state on Monday attempted to depict a much closer
relationship between the two.
   Court reporter Joan Giard described a gathering she attended at
the Holiday Inn in Waterbury. Wheel arrived with Hill on one arm
and Hayes on the other.
   ``She danced with Justice Hill that evening,'' Giard said. ``I
remember looking over.''
   Marks objected to much of the testimony about Wheel and her
criminal case, but was overruled by Harvey Otterman, the chairman
of the three-member hearing panel.
   The retirement of Hill, 60, from the high court leaves few
options for punishment if he is found guilty of judicial
misconduct. He could be reprimanded or perhaps restricted from
serving on the court under a law that allows retired justices to
sit on certain cases.

   ``Don't let them tell you this is a
television campaign,'' Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said
Monday as he raced through a final day of pre-Super Tuesday
campaigning.
   Still, Dukakis packed 21 television interviews into his final
day of stumping before Tuesday's primaries and caucuses in 20
states _ including 14 Southern and border states.
   He campaigned in person Monday in Miami and the Tampa area, then
traveled to an evening rally in the Raleigh-Durham area of North
Carolina before a scheduled flight back to Boston.
   ``If we can emerge from Super Tuesday with the lead in terms of
delegates, we'll be on our way to the nomination,'' he said.
   Dukakis kicked off the day of campaigning in Miami, perhaps his
most solid base of support in the South.
   At a senior citizens rally, Dukakis picked up the valued
endorsement of 74-year-old Annie Ackerman, who has a reputation in
Miami for being able to get out the vote.
   ``You have come out to listen to the man who will be the next
president of the United States,'' Ackerman said. She spoke of
Dukakis' immigrant roots, something he had in common with many of
those at the rally.
   ``My mother would have said he's a mensch,'' she said, referring
to the Yiddish word for good man. ``He's a person of integrity who
gets things done.''
   Ackerman, a former ward organizer for the late Chicago Mayor
Richard Daley, met with several of the presidential candidates but
decided on Dukakis after a straw poll of the residents of her
condominium complex.
   Dukakis traveled from Miami to Plant City to attend a strawberry
festival and also marched in a parade with Florida Attorney General
Robert Butterworth at his side on Monday.
   He planned to vote in his hometown of Brookline, Mass., Tuesday
morning, spend the day at his Statehouse office and then fly to
Chicago to begin campaigning for the Illinois primary.
   Throughout his Southern campaign swing, nearly all of Dukakis'
stops have come in areas where he is expected to win. The strategy
seems to be to reinforce areas of strength rather than seek new
support.
   ``There are only so many hours in a day _ you can't go
everywhere,'' the Massachusetts governor has repeatedly said.
   Asked whether the Super Tuesday primaries were a flop in
attracting moderate and conservative Democrats, Dukakis said,
``It's not been a flop for Mike Dukakis. I don't understand what
the labels mean.''
   Dukakis has not talked much about his opponents. He has
continued to criticize Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, seen by many
as his principal rival, but such comments have only come with
prompting from reporters.
   He said he is worried that the negative campaigning between him
and Gephardt is hurting the chances for the Democratic party in
November. In response to a barb from Gephardt criticizing the
Dukakis attacks, he said, ``No, I don't think I've impugned his
integrity.''
   Meanwhile, in Boston, 20 protesters were arrested outside
Dukakis' Statehouse office on trespassing charges as they staged a
sit-in to demand an immediate increase in welfare benefits.
   Most of the protesters went limp when told to leave the
building, so police had to lift them into nearby elevators.
   ``While he's out stumping, our kids are starving,'' one
protester shouted.

<TEXT>
   Stanlake Samkange, an author and
politician who fought for independence for Zimbabwe, died in Harare
of heart and lung ailments after a long illness, his widow said
Monday. He was 65.
   Tommie-Marie Samkange said her husband died Sunday.
   Samkange was the first black college graduate in the province of
Mashonaland in 1947 when Zimbabwe was the white-ruled British
colony of Rhodesia. He received a bachelor's degree with honors in
history.
   As a black nationalist, he held top posts in the next three
decades in several political parties including Joshua Nkomo's
Zimbabwe African People's Union and Bishop Abel Muzorewa's United
African National Council.
   Samkange retired from politics in 1979, the year when a
British-sponsored accord provided for independence for Zimbabwe and
rule by the black majority.
   Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union won the March
1980 elections and Mugabe became prime minister. Mugabe and Nkomo
had led rebel armies in guerrilla warfare against white domination.
   Samkange also worked as a free-lance journalist and wrote three
books on politics in Africa. He received a master of science degree
from Syracuse University in New York.
   After retiring he opened a publishing house.
   His wife said burial will be Saturday at the family farm at
Msengezi near Harare and a memorial service will be held Friday in
Harare.

   A jobless streetsweeper who set himself
afire near Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's residence was buried
Monday at a service attended by relatives, friends and about 100
unemployed Britons.
   Derek Bainbridge, 41, burned to death in his car parked 40 yards
from Mrs. Thatcher's Downing Street residence on Feb. 16.
   He had been unemployed for 18 months and left a suicide note
saying, ``Too young to retire, too old to live.''
   His family invited unemployed people to attend the funeral in
Bainbridge's hometown of Worksop in central England 180 miles from
London.
   Steven Brown said he came to the burial with other jobless
people ``because I can understand what Derek Bainbridge went
through. People can't understand how you feel having to pay for
rent, gas and electricity when you don't have a job.''
   The Rev. Brian Hunt, who presided at the service, said prayers
for the unemployed and ``for those who are going through
depression, frustration and anger.''
   Britain's unemployment has doubled from 1.3 million in 1979,
when Mrs. Thatcher won her first of three terms in office, to 2.6
million in December. The government has said that was a seasonably
adjusted 9.4 percent of the work force.

   A woman told authorities Monday that she
threw her housemate's missing 7-month-old daughter into the
Delaware River, but police said they didn't know whether to believe
the retarded woman.
   Divers aided by tracking dogs searched the chilly river for the
blue-eyed infant, who disappeared Sunday from a row house near
Trenton State Prison. At dusk Monday, the search was suspended
indefinitely.
   The 30-year-old woman was in police custody Monday but had not
been charged, said police Sgt. Robert Orlowski.
   When police first questioned her Sunday, the woman said a man
had knocked her down, kidnapped the toddler and driven off,
Orlowski said. Then she said the man tossed the baby into the
river. After further questioning, she said the baby fell off her
lap into the river, Orlowski said.
   ``She admitted this morning that she threw the baby in the river
yesterday,'' Orlowski said.
   ``They don't know really whether to believe her or not because
of her diminished mental capacity. She has the capacity of a 4- or
5-year-old. Her story has changed so many times since she reported
it, they really don't know what to believe,'' Orlowski said.
   ``The detective who has been with her all day yesterday and
today feels pretty certain this is what happened,'' Orlowski said.
   According to police, the woman asked the baby's mother, Rebecca
McGuinn, for permission to play with the baby Sunday morning.
   Ms. McGuinn gave her approval, but said the woman had to remain
in the living room. However, the woman apparently took the child
from the house while the mother was asleep, Orlowski said.

   Vice President George Bush said Monday ``the
person that clearly wins Super Tuesday is going to be the nominee
of the party'' as he coasted on polls that gave him a big lead in
most of the 17 GOP contests.
   Bush stopped short of forecasting a sweep on Tuesday.
   ``You always wish for that but I certainly would never predict
that. It's too much for anyone to expect,'' he said earlier in the
day.
   At his last public appearance of the day, in Rogers, Ark., the
vice president said he was ``optimistic but not overconfident.''
   Asked what he'd do if he didn't win Super Tuesday, he replied:
``I'll have to do what I did when I got kicked in Iowa _ get up off
the canvas, go out and fight hard.'' After his third-place finish
in Iowa, Bush went on to a solid win in the New Hampshire primary
eight days later.
   In a two-hour stop at Tulsa International Airport, he told a
rally that Super Tuesday constitutes ``the most historic political
event in modern political history.''
   ``It's critical,'' he said. ``The person that clearly wins Super
Tuesday is going to be the nominee of the party and I think the
next president.''
   Bush, introduced by Gov. Henry Bellmon at the rally, later
toured the American Airlines Maintenance and Engineering facility
at the airport and took a moment to turn a wrench on an engine.
   Bush appeared tired at a 15-minute news conference following a
brisk walking tour of the sprawling facility.
   The vice president dismissed the possibility of a brokered
convention.
   ``We're talking about victory and he's talking about brokering
something,'' he said. ``I don't see it happening. I think there are
so many events that I think the Republican nominee will be
determined before the convention.''
   Bush was asked about negative ads that he called ``comparative''
spots criticizing Dole's record in the Senate.
   ``When attacked, you'll see some retaliation,'' Bush said. ``But
when you look at the totality and how it all came about, I think
people understand that a person has a right to, in a laser-like
fashion, go after them. I think actually the factual back-up of
those ads is pretty irrefutable.''
   Bush, a former oilman, said he feels ``compatible with the base
of this state.'' But he said he cannot support a tax on imported
oil as a means of shoring up the ailing domestic energy business.
   ``I was in the oil business, and I remember what it was like to
have government controls, allocations of markets and regulation.
And who hated it the worst? The oil industry,'' Bush said.
   ``That also has an artificial, inflationary built-in premise to
it. Everybody's costs go up. It's like any other tax. And I'm
opposed to raising taxes. The industry is split on the oil import
fee. I don't happen to be in favor of it. I think what I propose,
including a tax credit for exploration ... is the way to go.''

<HEAD>West Germany Denies Serious Disagreements with Allies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government insisted Monday
that West Germany had had no serious disagreements with its NATO
allies about disarmament at an alliance summit last week.
   ``Attempts ... to fabricate disagreements on basic questions
between the Federal Republic and its allies ... find a basis
neither in the proceedings nor in the results of the summit,'' said
a communique.
   It said Chancellor Helmut Kohl determined at the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization summit in Brussels, Belgium, that the alliance
will ``concentrate on working out a comprehensive (disarmament)
concept.''
   Kohl assumed from the talks that ``work within the alliance will
proceed smoothly, and be finished at the latest within a year,''
said the statement read to reporters by government spokesman
Friedhelm Ost.
   It also said there should not be attempts to ``artifically
create pressures'' on NATO to make a quick decision on the
modernization of short-range nuclear weapons.
   That remark appeared to be aimed at Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain, who told the summit that the alliance would
soon have to think seriously about modernizing its aging
short-range nuclear weapons.
   Kohl had resisted demands at the summit for a stronger NATO
position on the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons, which
have a range of up to 300 miles.
   Kohl wants NATO to postpone the scheduled modernization of those
weapons and to begin negotiations with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
alliance on reducing short-range nuclear arsenals.
   Monday's statement repeated Kohl's position that he does not
favor total removal of nuclear weapons from Europe, but wants a
reduction and parity in conventional and nuclear arms by both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact.
   Bonn officials have said West Germany would be the main
battleground in a European war because it borders East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.

   Prosecutors Monday sought a one-month
delay in Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial for allegedly concealing
a $350,000 campaign loan, while defense lawyers said the charges
should be dismissed.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan said he would
rule on the delay motion, which was opposed by the defense,
Wednesday or Thursday. He did not say when he would rule on a
series of defense motions brought Monday.
   Delays in pretrial procedures sought by the defense have left
too little time for prosecutors to prepare, said Assistant Attorney
General Barnett Lotstein. He sought to change the trial starting
date from March 22 to April 21.
   ``The governor's political agenda has no place in this
courtroom,'' Lotstein told Ryan. ``He wants a speedy trial. We want
a trial after the rules have been complied with.''
   Defense attorney Michael Scott argued against a delay in the
trial, adding, ``We want to resolve this matter and put it behind
us.''
   In an indictment handed up Jan. 8, the governor was charged with
six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents in
his failure to disclose a $350,000 campaign loan. His brother and
1986 campaign manager, Willard Mecham, faces three similar counts.
   Mecham's Senate impeachment trial went into its second week
Monday, and he also faces a May 17 recall election.
   Defense attorneys filed a series of motions Monday seeking:
   _ Dismissal or a new determination of the charges' validity, on
several grounds including a claim that people who had a definite
stance on the Mecham recall movement were unfairly excluded from
the grand jury.
   The motion said the indictments should be dismissed ``because
both those who favored the recall and those who opposed the recall
were blanketly excluded from the grand jury without any regard'' to
their ability to make a fair decision.
   _ Dismissal of the charges on grounds the Mechams were victims
of selective prosecution.
   The motion claimed that other public figures, including state
lawmakers such as former House Majority Leader Burton Barr and
current House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, were not prosecuted
when it was found that they had omitted items from their financial
disclosure statements.
   ``Not only was Governor Mecham not given a written opportunity
to file an amended return, his protestations of oversight and
avowals of no criminal intent fell upon deaf ears,'' the motion
said. ``Why? Because the political turmoil surrounding his nine
months in office threatened to destroy the power and influence the
Republican Party had spent more than 20 years nurturing and
cultivating.''
   _ A change of venue because of massive pretrial publicity, and
separate questioning of prospective jurors in an effort to see that
they are not biased.
   _ Separate trials for Evan and Willard Mecham, who now are
scheduled to be tried together.
   Ryan also took under advisement a defense motion to dismiss two
of the counts against Willard Mecham and four of the counts against
the governor. The defense claimed the grand jury did not have
jurisdiction to bring those charges.

   A homeless man who gained national recognition for
his refusal to abandon his makeshift camp on state-owned land was
found dead in his hut Monday by his children, police said. Bill
Britt was 52.
   Britt's badly decomposed body was found by his son and daughter
in his hut about 30 feet from the fence surrounding the Evergreen
Cemetery in Boston's Brighton district, spokesman Scott Gillis said.
   Britt, born Britton William Boughner in the affluent
neighborhood near the state-owned land, had lived at the reservoir
near Boston College since 1969.
   ``In his case, he felt that this was where he wanted to live,
this was his estate,'' said Clyde Raymond, a friend of Britt's.
``He died free, so to speak. He had his own drummer and he stuck
with it.''
   Britt, who was known as the ``hermit of Chestnut Hill,'' had
been dead for several months and his body, dressed in multiple
layers of clothing, was almost reduced to skeletal, Gillis said.
   An autopsy was performed on Britt in an attempt to determine the
cause of death, but results weren't expected until Tuesday, Gillis
said.
   In 1985, officials started trying to move Britt from the
Metropolitan District Commission land in the Chestnut Hill district
on the Boston-Brookline border.
   Britt, who was legally blind, lived on money he earned redeeming
can and bottle deposits. He refused welfare and several attempts to
relocate him to public or subsidized housing.
   In May, Britt's plastic and wood wigwam was destroyed in a fire
while he was in New York City to appear on the ``Late Night with
David Letterman'' television show. He rebuilt it, despite
deteriorating health. Doctors said Britt, who was nearly toothless,
had ulcers and needed a corneal transplant.

   A judge Monday refused to dismiss an
indictment or delay the murder trial of a former state trooper
accused of killing a fellow officer in her patrol car.
   Circuit Judge J.C. Norton rejected the defense motions as jury
selection opened in the trial of Joseph Cecil Duncan, 33, who is
charged with shooting Elizabeth Cobb, 31, three times in the head
at close range.
   Miss Cobb's body was found Oct. 12 in her patrol car near a
rural Dallas County church. The FBI has said Miss Cobb was the
first female state trooper in the nation to be slain on duty.
Duncan attended her funeral and was charged in the case later.
   Authorities say Duncan was the beneficiary of a $250,000
insurance policy on the victim's life. Duncan has pleaded innocent
and says he and Miss Cobb planned to marry.
   Jury selection was expedited Monday when the judge declined to
grant a defense motion to question potential jurors individually
rather than have members of the jury pool answer general questions
put to all.
   The defense had argued that the state destroyed evidence that
might have been significant to the defense. The evidence in
question was the bullets from a .22-caliber pistol found in a black
Trans-Am.
   At one point after Miss Cobb disappeared on patrol, officers
issued a bulletin for a black Trans Am that reportedly had been
chased by Miss Cobb's patrol car in Dallas County.
   Defense attorney Henry Pitts said a Texas drifter named Charlie
Shoemaker is being held on drug charges in Okaloosa County, Fla.,
and is the man who was driving the black Trans-Am.
   But Assistant Attorney General William Wasden said Monday that
prosecution witnesses will show Shoemaker is not involved in the
shooting.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government
withheld nearly $20,000 belonging to the U.S. Embassy and its
employees when they turned in their money in a currency exchange,
an embassy source said Monday.
   The source, who spoke on condition he not be further identified,
said the embassy turned 208 million old cordobas in to the
government in exchange for new ones in accordance with last month's
economic measures.
   The total, which included private money and embassy funds, was
worth about $20,800.
   The government last month created a new cordoba worth 1,000
times more than the old one and pegged it at 10 to the U.S. dollar.
   The government set an exchange limit of 10 million in cordobas
per person or institution, or the equivalent of $1,000. The U.S.
Embassy was given $1,000, and the rest was withheld.
   According to the new law, the remainder should be put in a bank
account, where it is converted to the new currency but frozen. An
embassy spokesman said Monday the embassy had no information
whether that occurred.
   A Central Bank spokeswoman said she had no information on the
U.S. Embassy account, but confirmed that the money should have been
put in an account.
   The embassy source said the Sandinistas asked for proof that the
cordobas turned over by the Americans were obtained legally in
Nicaragua. Exchange houses issue receipts for dollars turned into
cordobas. The government did not require such receipts from
individuals changing their currency.
   ``I don't know if we have receipts for everybody,'' the embassy
source said. ``I know I always throw mine out.''
   Embassy spokesman Lou Falino said: ``We have no comment.''

   Developer Peter Kalikow took ownership of the
New York Post from Rupert Murdoch on Monday, calling it a historic
moment and pledging to make the money-losing tabloid ``a winner
financially and editorially.''
   The papers transferring ownership were signed Monday afternoon,
according to Post spokesman Howard Rubenstein. Last month, after
marathon bargaining, the Post's 10 unions agreed to concessions
required by the new owner, and the last of the unions officially
ratified the concessions Sunday.
   ``The rescue of the Post is nothing less than an historic
moment,'' Kalikow said in a statement, thanking the unions and
employees ``for their heroic efforts.''
   Union leaders will sign formal papers Tuesday and meet with
Kalikow on Thursday to ``get to know each other,'' said George
McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, which
represents eight of the 10 unions.
   ``We're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over,''
McDonald said.
   Kalikow bought the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper for $37.6 million from Murdoch, who sold the paper to
comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations barring
ownership of two media outlets in the same city. Murdoch owns
WNYW-TV in New York.
   The sale was contingent upon the union concessions, which
totaled $22 million and eliminated 130 jobs.
   Murdoch, who was in London on Monday, has said he was losing
$100,000 a day with the Post and had lost $150 million in the 12
years he owned it.
   Kalikow said he intended to stop the Post's losses and added:
``I am committed to expanding its readership base through millions
of dollars in promotion, adding features to the paper, greatly
expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its
advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a long-term
basis.''
   ``The paper will be a winner financially and editorially,'' he
said.

   An Israeli businessman with reported links to
Israeli politicians and army officers went on trial Monday accused
of being a spy for the Soviet Union, his lawyer said.
   Shabtai Kalmanovich, 46, who emigrated to Israel from the Soviet
Union in 1971, denied the charges, according to defense attorney
Amnon Zichroni.
   He said the Tel Aviv District Court hearing the case barred him
from further comment. The trial is being held behind closed doors
and Zichroni said it is expected to last about seven months.
   Kalmanovich has been in custody since his arrest Dec. 23.
   Israel television has described Kalmanovich as an international
businessman with interests in Africa who ``employed hundreds of
people throughout the world, among them former Israeli (Cabinet)
ministers and reserve officers.''
   The Jan. 10 report said, ``Among his friends were members of the
Knesset (parliament), high-ranking politicians and senior army
reserve officers.'' It did not give any names.
   Kalmanovich was born in Lithuania and after his arrival in
Israel he served in the army and then worked briefly as an aide to
former Israeli legislator Shmuel Flatto-Sharon.
   The television report said Kalmanovich had connections with
people involved in East-West spy swaps in the 1970s. It said that
in August 1977, Kalmanovich traveled to East Germany and met with
Wolfgang Vogel, an East German lawyer who mediated such exchanges.
   In April 1978, Kalmanovich helped bring about the release of an
Israeli prisoner from a jail in Mozambique, according to the
television account. It said that in the same month, East Germany
released an American student and the United States freed Robert G.
Thompson who had been convicted of passing secrets to the Soviets.

   Harris Glenn Milstead, known to moviegoers as
Divine, the campy, 300-pound transvestite star of such films as
``Pink Flamingos'' and ``Hairspray,'' died in his sleep in a hotel
room, the coroner's office said Monday. He was 42.
   Los Angeles County Coroner spokesman Steve Stewart said
investigators went to the Regency Plaza Hotel on Hollywood
Boulevard, where Milstead was a guest when he died during the
night. ``The cause of death is under investigation,'' Stewart said.
   Milstead apparently died of asphyxiation, said spokesman John
West of PMK Public Relations.
   ``He was finally getting respect within the industry,'' said
Milstead's manager, Bernard Jay. ``He was getting the legitimate
screen and television offers that showed the industry had finally
accepted him as the very good character actor he always knew he
was.''
   Milstead got a medical checkup last Friday and was declared in
excellent health, other than his weight, ``which has been a
constant problem throughout his life,'' said Jay.
   West said Milstead, star of the latest John Waters-directed
movie ``Hairspray,'' was in Los Angeles to appear in an episode of
the Fox Network television series ``Married ... With Children.''
   Milstead was to have appeared in that role dressed as a man, but
he was best known to movie fans as the bizarre female impersonating
star of such cult classic films as ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Lust In
The Dust,'' ``Polyester'' and ``Female Trouble.''
   The Divine character was garishly made up and outrageously
chesty, as well as loud, raucous and foul-mouthed. Milstead's
appearance made the first Waters films a favorite for
after-midnight showings at arty cinema houses.
   But with each film, both Milstead and Waters found a wider
audience, and ``Hairspray'' has enjoyed a good following as well as
flattering reviews, coming in No. 16 this weekend in the box office
with $577,258 at 79 theaters for a $7,307 per screen average.
   In the film, set in the early 1960s, he plays the mother of a
chubby teen-age girl who becomes a teen television dance star and
pioneer integrationist. Dressed as a man, he also plays a
segregationist television station manager.
   In another non-transvestite role, Milstead played a Sydney
Greenstreet-type character in the 1985 film ``Trouble In Mind.''
   Milstead said in a 1985 interview that he grew up fat and
taunted by classmates in Lutherville, a suburb of Baltimore. The
only son of a businessman and his wife, Milstead told an
interviewer he had a fantasy life revolving around female movie
stars and dreams of becoming a celebrity.
   One of his few friends from high school was Waters, whose
obsession with trashy movies nearly matched Milstead's fantasies of
celebrity. Waters began casting his friend in bizarre roles.
   In the 1972 ``Pink Flamingos,'' Divine was introduced as ``the
filthiest person alive.''
   ``The character is a real person,'' Milstead once said of
Divine. ``Sometimes she's just too bold, but she has socially
redeeming qualities, no matter what she does. She's her own person
and a lot of people like that.
   ``The camp element is something out of the ordinary, this big
man playing a sexy woman.''
   Besides film roles, Milstead also used the Divine persona in a
nightclub act.
   He is survived by his mother and father, Frances and Harris
Milstead, who now live in Florida, West said.

   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, on a last-ditch
campaign swing through Missouri Monday, all but conceded Super
Tuesday to Vice President George Bush _ but said he wasn't giving
up the fight for the Republican presidential nomination.
   ``We know that we won't be the front-runner after Super Tuesday,
but it's not over after Super Tuesday,'' he told a crowd of about
80 supporters during a brief rally at the Springfield Regional
Airport. ``We're going to win in November.''
   Earlier, in Oklahoma City, he said Bush appears strong in the
South but ``there may be some surprises'' and Republicans should
nominate someone who will win the general election.
   ``We don't want to lose the White House by nominating the wrong
person,'' Dole said.
   The senator from Kansas said his race against Bush for
Republican votes in the big round of balloting Tuesday was tight in
Oklahoma, Missouri and North Carolina.
   ``We're moving very quick in Georgia. Washington state looks
pretty good,'' Dole said at a news conference at Will Rogers World
Airport. ``There are some opportunities in Rhode Island and
Massachusetts.
   ``The other states? No, I think it's fair to say George Bush has
a good margin. But again, there may be some surprises.
   ``The final analysis is what happens in November,'' Dole said.
``Electability's going to be a big, big factor. We don't want to
lose the White House by nominating the wrong person.''
   Dole displayed a copy of Monday's Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald,
which published a survey saying that while Bush is the strongest
candidate among GOP primary voters, Dole is stronger among voters
of all parties.
   ``I attract a lot of Democrats and independents,'' Dole said in
commenting on the newspaper's poll, which surveyed 1,131 voters in
14 Southern states. ``I don't think I scare anybody off. I think I
attract a lot of people.''
   The senator took a verbal shot at Bush when asked whether the
Super Tuesday series of primaries and caucuses, with GOP events in
17 states and Democratic events in 20 states and American Samoa,
was too big.
   ``I think what the Democrats did was try to design a system
where they would in effect select the Democratic nominee. I'm not
sure that's going to work,'' he said.
   ``But what could happen is that they might select the weakest
Republican, so they might get a consolation prize that way.''
   On the GOP side, he said that ``this is a race between Bob Dole
and George Bush.''
   ``I would invite friends and supporters of (New York Rep.) Jack
Kemp and Pat Robertson to take a look at our candidacy and maybe
join us Tuesday night at polling places around the state,'' Dole
said.
   Dole was joined at the news conference by Oklahoma Republican
Sen. Don Nickles and several GOP members of the state Legislature
who are backing Dole. Nickles said Dole is the best-qualified
candidate to deal with the energy and agriculture industries vital
to Oklahoma, and predicted a victory on Tuesday.
   ``You've been to this state many times and have been warmly
received. I hope and expect you'll be warmly received on Tuesday
night as well,'' Nickles said.
   Dole, saying Kansas football teams don't have much success in
Oklahoma, said: ``It's about time you give Kansas a break, and give
America a break by voting for Bob Dole tomorrow.''

   A federal appeals court Monday halted work
on the Navy's plans to relocate the aircraft carrier Nimitz to
Everett, Wash., a project that has been opposed by environmental
groups.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered
the Navy to stop preliminary work on the $272 million project until
an appeals board reviews a state permit, chiefly on the issue of
how to dispose of contaminated sediment from harbor dredging.
   The Washington Shorelines Hearing Board began a final week of
hearings Monday on water quality and development permits for the
project. A decision is scheduled in May or June. Four votes are
needed on the six-member board to reject the state permit.
   ``We fully expect that when the project receives full review ...
there will be significant modifications,'' said Victor Sher, a
lawyer for six environmental groups that oppose the dredging.
   The ruling means ``the Navy must comply with state environmental
laws, just like everybody else,'' he said.
   Also opposing the project is the Tulalip Indian tribe, whose
fishing grounds include Everett Bay.
   Lt. Cmdr. Joe March, a spokesman for the home-port project, said
he would study the ruling to see what options the Navy has.
   The Navy plans to relocate the Nimitz and 12 support ships in
Everett Harbor on Puget Sound, hoping to have the first ships
arrive in 1992.
   The principal dispute is over the Navy's plan to dredge about
3.4 million cubic yards of sediment from the harbor and dispose of
it in Port Gardner Bay near crab beds at depths of 310 to 430 feet.
About a third of the sediment is contaminated with heavy metals and
organic compounds, the court said.
   The Navy plans to ``cap'' the contaminated dredging with a
lawyer of clean sediment. But the court said the technique is
experimental and has been criticized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, which said the method had failed both times it had been
tested at comparable depths.

   British soldiers shot three IRA members dead
and Britain said Monday the killings averted a ``dreadful terrorist
act'' in its fortress colony on the southern coast of Spain.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said in London the soldiers
opened fire Sunday after the unarmed IRA guerrillas parked a white
Renault-5 with Spanish license plates near The Convent, the
official residence of the governor. He said the soldiers acted on a
tip from Spanish police.
   Police said they were searching Gibraltar and adjacent Spanish
territory for a car believed connected with a bomb attack the Irish
Republican Army allegedly planned at the governor's residence
during the ceremonial changing of the guard, which hundreds of
spectators attend.
   Members of the Royal Anglian Regiment, just transferred from
duty in Northern Ireland, were scheduled to participate in the
ceremony Tuesday. The IRA is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the
British from Northern Ireland.
   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, gangs of youths charged into the
streets Monday afternoon, throwing firebombs at buses, vans and
trucks in violence that continued into the evening, police reported.
   Bus service in Roman Catholic areas was halted after several
buses were set afire.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice, said he did not know if the attacks were a reaction to
the reports from Gibraltar.
   The two men and a woman were shot by men described by witnesses
as wearing jeans and speaking with British accents.
   The British soldiers were believed to be members of the Special
Air Services, or SAS, an elite undercover unit that has been
involved in previous actions against the IRA.
   Sgt. George Field of the 220-man Gibraltar police force said
officers were looking for a Ford automobile but did not believe it
contained explosives.
   The independent Spanish news agency Europa Press quoted police
in Madrid, however, as saying the car might contain explosives
intended for an attack Tuesday.
   Howe acknowledged in his remarks to Parliament that the three
IRA members were on foot and unarmed when they were killed Sunday
afternoon while heading for the Spanish frontier.
   He said they were challenged and ``made movements which led
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''
   ``There is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterday's
events a dreadful terrorist act has been averted,'' Howe said.
``The three people killed were actively involved in the planning
and attempted execution of that act.''
   The foreign secretary also said a fourth IRA guerilla ``recently
crossed into Gibraltar and is thought to have carried out a
reconnaissance for an act of terrorism.''
   Gasoline pumps at the Shell service station where two were shot
down bore several bullet holes police had marked with blue arrows.
About 100 hundred yards up the avenue, where the third fell, white
marks on a large tree indicated more bullet holes.
   Howe said the soldiers found keys to a second car on the body of
one of the men. That car, a red Ford Fiesta registered in Spain,
was found parked in La Linea de la Concepcion on the Spanish side
of the gate separating this 2.25-square-mile limestone rock from
the Spanish mainland.
   In the Ford, police found three false passports, an alarm clock,
insulating tape, gloves, wire and a set of keys to the third car,
which police are searching for, Howe said.
   He said reports that the Renault contained several hundred
pounds of explosives were unfounded.
   Europa Press said Spanish police speculated that the IRA members
left the Renault near the Convent to make sure there would be space
for the third car, which they planned to park on Tuesday rigged as
a as a car bomb.
   The IRA identified the dead as Mairead Farrell, 31, who served
10 years in prison for bombing a Belfast hotel; Daniel McCann, 30,
and Sean Savage, 24, all of West Belfast. The men had been arrested
on charges of possessing explosives.
   Sir Peter Terry, the governor and commander-in-chief of British
forces in the colony, issued a statement praising the 30,000
residents and said the people of Gibraltar showed ``their
determination to stand alongside all British people in their fight
against international terrorism.''
   Augustin Valladolid, spokesman for Spanish state security, said
in Madrid that Spanish police spotted the three IRA members on the
southern Costa del Sol more than a month ago and told British
authorities, who requested surveillance but no intervention.
   El Pais, Spain's leading daily, said they left Spain a week ago,
probably for Britain, ``but planned to return to Malaga and did.''
It quoted Spanish police as saying they followed the trio ``right
up to the gate'' of Gibraltar.
   In Parliament, Howe expressed gratitude to Spanish authorities,
``without whose invaluable assistance the outcome might have been
very different.''
   Gibraltar is a sore point in relations between Britain and
Spain, which claims sovereignty over the rock it ceded in 1713
after losing the War of Spanish Succession.

   Bank accounts containing what's left of the fortune
donated to save liver-transplant patient Ronnie DeSillers were
frozen Monday after a judge was told the dead boy's mother had
spent some of the charity money on jewelry, clothes and furniture,
a state attorney said.
   Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie appointed a curator to
manage the estate in accordance with a petition filed by state
Attorney General Robert Butterworth and State Attorney Janet Reno
of Miami.
   Ronnie's mother, Maria DeSillers, has spent more than half of
the money donated to her 7-year-old son, who died last year while
awaiting a fourth transplant, the petition said.
   Among the donors was President Reagan, who like many others was
touched by news reports of the theft of funds raised by Ronnie's
classmates. He gave $1,000.
   When Ronnie died at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh last April
29, an account in his name had accumulated $509,913, the petition
said. The account balance on Feb. 17 was $239,288, said Fred
Kerstein, assistant state attorney and chief of the economic
criminal division.
   As recently as Jan. 19, 1988, $25,000 had been withdrawn from
the fund, ``thereby further depleting the assets of the estate,''
the petition said.
   ``Based upon an examination of bank records, at least $47,000
appears to have been expended by Maria DeSillers on jewelry,
clothing, furniture, housing expenses, an automobile and automobile
expenses, these funds having been assets of this estate,'' it said.
There was no further breakdown of the expenditures in the petition.
   Asked about the allegations in the petition, Ms. DeSillers said:
``Why do they not say that money went to charity? Why do they not
say that some of that money was assigned to me personally? ... How
come they don't say how much of that money went to kids?''
   She said she had already planned to use the money that was
frozen to help two ailing children who are awaiting transplants,
one from Miami and the other from Costa Rica, and would go to
probate court to straighten out the dispute.
   ``There are two children that have less than six months to live,
and that's what I want to do with the money,'' she said.
   Ms. DeSillers is being sued by Children's Hospital for failing
to pay $261,189 of Ronnie's $424,302 bill.
   In refusing to pay the balance, Ms. DeSillers charged the
hospital with giving poor care to her son and threatened to file a
malpractice suit.
   Ms. DeSillers and her lawyer, Harold Robbins, said last month
they would refuse to pay a $1,000 state fine for allegedly
violating Florida charity laws.
   She said through Robbins that she had never asked the public to
donate money and she was not legally a charity. She also said she
was entitled to the money as Ronnie's sole heir.
   After Ronnie's death, Ms. DeSillers created the foundation to
assist other children in need of organ transplants.
   She returned to the limelight when it was learned that the
formerly unemployed public relations agent was living in a luxury
apartment building and driving a BMW equipped with a telephone.
   She denied squandering any of the donations, explaining that the
car was second-hand, the car telephone was a gift and the apartment
doubled as her office.
   The petition filed by Butterworth and Ms. Reno asked that
Ronnie's estate be frozen ``to prevent additional assets of the
estate ... from being wasted and to protect persons interested in
the estate, including creditors.''
   ``Immediate and irreparable injury will result to assets of the
estate ... if Maria DeSillers is permitted to withdraw the funds,''
the petition said.
   Attorney Karen Geivers was appointed estate curator, Kerstein
said.

<TEXT>
   The first inmates arrive Tuesday at Camp
Sauble for 90-day terms of hard labor and military-style discipline
that officials hope will keep the young offenders out of the prison
system.
   It is Michigan's first experiment with a probationary program
that has caught on in other states. The so-called ``boot camp,''
one of about 15 such programs in seven states, is a last stop for
young, first-time felons who otherwise would have been sent to
prison for at least a year.
   ``A lot of the people put into the corrections system have never
been held accountable for anything in their lives, and as a result,
have never had any pride,'' Deputy Warden Stanley Adams said.
``Here, we hope they'll leave with a sense of accomplishment
because they'll be held accountable for everything they do.''
   ``Everything'' includes how their hair is trimmed to how their
beds are made and how their uniforms are buttoned.
   The first dozen of an eventual 156 probationers are expected by
the end of the week at Camp Sauble, a former state Corrections
Department minimum-security work camp tucked away in Manistee
National Forest in northeast Michigan. Inmates must be between the
ages of 17 and 25 and never have been in the prison system before.
   The inmates will rise at 5 a.m. each day and prepare for an
inspection of bunks and uniforms. After breakfast, they will fall
in for an exercise period before heading out for about seven hours
of unpaid work in and around Mason County.
   Before dinner, there will be more physical training and
calisthenics, and after dinner inmates will attend academic or
substance-abuse treatment programs. One hour will be allowed
nightly to write letters or watch television news before lights go
out at 10 p.m.
   Military protocol will be enforced strictly. Inmates will be
required to stand at attention when in the presence of an
instructor and will receive demerits for violations.
   If an inmate commits a serious crime, such as the assault of a
staff member or fellow inmate, or if he receives three misconduct
charges, he will be returned to the judge who sentenced him, likely
resulting in a prison sentence.
   If a candidate passes the program successfully, he will be freed
on probation.
   Some say the program is an effective way to jolt first-time
offenders into straightening out. Others claim it is a ploy by
politicians who want their constituents to believe they're tough on
crime.
   One such critic is Jerry Miller, executive director of National
Alternatives to Incarceration.
   ``The people in these programs are usually from families where
yelling and screaming and putting down are day-to-day occurrences,
so a program like this isn't going to scare them,'' said Miller,
whose non-profit organization, based in Alexandria, Va., studies
programs that keep offenders out of prison.

   Three Palestinian guerrillas seized a
commuter bus Monday and held nuclear plant workers hostage, killing
three Israeli civilians and wounding nine before police shot the
hijackers to death, officials said.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed responsibility,
saying in a statement released in Nicosia, Cyprus, that the
hijacking was part of ``escalating military action'' against Israel.
   The statement said the guerrillas launched the attack from
within Israel, and did not infiltrate from a neighboring country.
   Israeli army officials said the guerrillas infiltrated from
Egypt and held 10 women and one man hostage for about three hours.
The bus was seized as it shuttled workers of the top-secret Dimona
nuclear plant.
   In the occupied territories, at least 12 Arabs were shot Monday
during clashes with Israeli troops, and the army said Palestinian
protesters hurled a grenade at troops, wounding one soldier
slightly in the West Bank village of Idna.
   Also, more than 20 Arab tax collectors in the Gaza Strip
submitted mass resignations after underground leaflets called for
Palestinians to quit working for Israel's military administration.
An army official says the resignations are not final.
   Israeli analysts said escalating violence could harden the
position of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the right-wing Likud
bloc, which has not accepted the peace initiatives of U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel's Knesset, or
parliament, that Monday's bus victims ``were killed for mothing
else but for their being Jewish, residents of Israel.''
   In an anonymous telephone call to a Western news agency in
Israel, a man said the hijacking was the work of PLO's Force 17, a
Palestinian commando group linked to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   If the commandos did come from Egypt, it would mark the eighth
infiltration into Israel from Egypt, Jordan or Lebanon since late
November.
   Shamir said the infiltrations and the three months of violence
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were part of a PLO
strategy.
   ``These are the same people who incite violence in the
(occupied) territories. We shall not tire from fighting them,''
Shamir said on Israel Radio.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
condemned the hijacking and noted ``with sadness that at a time
when the majority ... are looking for a peaceful solution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, terrorists emerge to attack the innocents.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a leader of Israel's doves, said
the hijacking was an indication of why Israel refused to deal with
Arafat.
   ``This shows exactly why the PLO is a disaster for both Arabs
and Jews,'' Peres said.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces chief of staff, said the
guerrillas crossed the lightly guarded border from Egypt, and he
criticized Egyptian authorities for not doing more to stop such
infiltrations.
   Army officials said the terrorists were armed with fragmentation
grenades, two Soviet Kalashnikov assault rifles and a Swedish-made
Karl Gustav submachine gun.
   The Arab gunmen first seized a small military vehicle at about 7
a.m. near the Nafha prison, a few miles from the Sinai Desert
border with Egypt.
   The guerrillas, riding in the captured vehicle, went on a
rampage along the highway, shooting at passing cars and trucks and
wounding one Israeli man in the leg, police officials said.
   Police chased the car and shot out a tire, forcing the
guerrillas to abandon the vehicle, police said.
   The guerrillas then seized the red-and-white bus carrying
workers to the Dimona nuclear plant, during which the bus' driver
and all but 11 passengers escaped. Police later stopped the vehicle
by barricading the road near the Aroer junction.
   The Arab trio was headed toward Beersheva, away from the nuclear
facility, when they seized the bus, indicating the facility was not
the target of the guerrillas.
   The guerrillas gave Israeli authorities one hour to produce an
International Red Cross official and free jailed Palestinians.
   ``They presented an ultimatum. If their demand were not met
within half an hour, including the release of detainees and
Palestinian terrorists, they will (kill) the hostages,'' said Maj.
Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, the army's southern commander.
   Moments later, Mordechai said, the guerrilla leader fatally shot
in the chest Victor Ran, 39, the father of three children.
   ``When they fired and executed one of the hostages and fired at
the women who were in the bus, despite our promises that we will
not harm them ... we stormed the bus and killed the three
terrorists,'' Mordechai said on Israel radio.
   He said the assault by anti-terror police lasted about one
minute.
   Rina Shiratzky, 31, the mother of two, and Miriam Ben Yair, 46,
the mother of four, were fatally wounded when Israeli soldiers
stormed the bus.
   Mordechai said an investigation showed the shots were fired by
the Arab guerrillas.

<HEAD>Polish Primate Invited To Visit Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's
Roman Catholic church, said Monday he has been invited to visit
Moscow in early June for ceremonies marking the 1,000th anniversary
of Russian Christendom.
   No Polish primate has ever visited the Soviet Union.
   Glemp said he received the invitation last month to attend
observances organized by the Russian Orthodox church.
   ``There have been no talks yet,'' Glemp told reporters at
Warsaw's Okecie Airport after returning from a weeklong visit to
Rome, where he met with Polish-born Pope John Paul II. ``I only got
a formal invitation. I want to go, obviously.''
   Church sources have said a visit by Glemp to the Soviet Union
could help pave the way for a future visit there by the pope.
   In January, John Paul said he would visit the Soviet Union only
if he could meet with Roman Catholics around the country.
   Glemp has let it be known he would like to visit the Soviet
Union, especially former Polish territories in the Soviet
Lithuanian republic that has a large Polish minority and where the
Catholic faith is quite strong.
   Asked whether he planned to visit other places than Moscow,
Glemp said he ``might change from an official church representative
into a tourist for a few hours ... with pleasure because there are
many things to see there.''
   The Soviet invitation reflects a turnaround since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power three years ago.
   The Soviets previously attacked the Polish church for inspiring
opposition activities, but more recently have made overtures to
Polish Catholics.
   Almost 90 percent of Poland's population is Catholic.

<TEXT>
   An unemployed handyman waived his right to a
jury Monday and his trial began on charges of killing seven women
and leaving their bodies to rot in and near his apartment.
   Harrison ``Marty'' Graham's decision came as Common Pleas Judge
Robert Latrone prepared to begin jury selection. Graham then
entered pleas of innocent to seven counts each of murder, voluntary
manslaughter and abuse of a corpse.
   The judge, after determining Graham, 28, understood the charges,
ordered the lawyers to begin presenting their cases. Both sides
waived opening statements.
   Assistant District Attorney Roger King moved for admission of
all testimony and documents from a monthlong pretrial suppression
hearing, including a confession Graham made to police, admitting
strangling the seven women during sex. Latrone granted the request.
   During the pretrial hearing, defense attorney Joel Moldovsky,
contending his client is mentally incompetent, sought
unsuccessfully to suppress the confession.
   Moldovsky argued the confession was made in violation of
Graham's constitutional rights and after Graham allegedly was
beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation.
   Graham surrendered to police at his mother's urging Aug. 16
after a weeklong manhunt that started when he was evicted from his
apartment because of a putrid stench.
   A police search uncovered the rotting bodies in Graham's bedroom
and leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment house.
   In the confession, Graham told police the bodies began piling up
in his bedroom and he began having problems with maggots. He also
told of his difficulty sleeping during the day because of birds on
the roof outside his apartment, picking at human remains.
   Moldovsky has indicated that Graham's defense will be insanity.
   The first witness called by the prosecution, acting Medical
Examiner Robert Catherman, said all seven deaths were homicides but
said it was impossible in most cases to determine the cause of
death because of decomposition.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers in tanks and
jeeps patrolled the main streets and poorer areas of the capital
Monday to block further protests against the rising cost of living.
   President Joaquin Balaguer summoned his advisers to discuss ways
of controlling inflation, a major factor in recent unrest in this
Caribbean island nation of more than 6.5 million people.
   Protesters burned tires early Monday during a 24-hour strike in
five low-income sectors of Santo Domingo.
   Three days of clashes last week between protesters and soldiers
left one person dead and many businesses damaged. More than 300
people were arrested.
   The previous week, three people were killed and eight injured in
protests in eight of the country's 26 provinces.
   Support seemed to be dwindling for a general strike called for
Wednesday to demand lower prices for basic commodities, wage
increases for public and private workers and better public services.
   ``We are willing to talk and hold sincere discussions with the
authorities to solve the conflict as long as they manifest their
sincere willingness to satisfy our demands,'' said spokeswoman
Virtudes Alvarez of the National Conference of Popular
Organizations.
   The group called for the general strike and organized earlier
strikes in the last few weeks that shut down many parts of the
capital.
   Labor groups opposed the strike, but promised to support it if
it takes place. They want either a later strike or talks among the
government, unions and business community to try to solve the
economic problems.
   The main opposition party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party, is
also against the strike, although left-wing political parties
support it.
   Balaguer said Sunday he would meet with his agricultural
advisers, merchants and business people to develop a plan to
implement price controls.
   Shortages of many goods, including milk, have become prevalent.
   A private economist estimated the February inflation rate at
about 5 percent and predicted a 50 to 60 percent rate for 1988 if
that continued.
   Private sources have estimated inflation in 1987 at around 30
percent, although the government's Central Bank maintains it was
closer to 16 percent.

<HEAD>Author Of Religious Petition Charged With Slander</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a petition on religious
freedom in communist Czechoslovakia that was signed by about
300,000 people has been arrested and charged with slander, an
emigre source said Monday.
   The London-based emigre publishing firm Palach Press said
Augustin Navratil was accused of committing ``slander of a state
organ and of a public organization.'' Conviction is punishiable by
up to one year in prison.
   The exact targets of the purported slander were not spelled out.
   Navratil, a Roman Catholic activist from a village in Moravia,
was one of 16 people detained over the weekend in advance of a
Catholic pilgrimage in Prague Sunday.
   Dissident sources in Prague said Navratil was detained Friday
morning. Other activists were held for 48 hours and released late
Sunday or early Monday, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Palach Press said it was not clear if Stanislav Devaty, a
spokesman for the Charter 77 human rights movement, was rearrested
after his 48-hour detention expired.
   In Czechoslovakia, authorities may hold people for 48 hours
without formal charges.
   Dissident sources said Devaty was detained late Friday night
after attending a dinner with British diplomats in an embassy
secretary's apartment.
   Five other dissident activists invited to the dinner were
detained before they could get in, and that action drew a strong
protest from the British Foreign Office.
   Navratil's petition calls for separation of church and state and
for bishops to fill Czechoslovakia's 10 empty Roman Catholic sees.
   Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek gave unprecedented support to the
petition in a letter of Jan. 4.
   Palach Press also reported that in a separate development, 12
people were briefly detained Saturday in Prague as they left the
home of a granddaughter of Thomas G. Masaryk, president of
Czechoslovakia's pre-World War II democracy.
   It said the group had planned a graveside ceremony on Sunday
honoring Masaryk in the village of Lany, about 30 miles west of
Prague.
   Monday was the anniversary of Masaryk's birth in 1850. The U.S.
embassy planned to lay a wreath at the grave.

   The presidential candidates are suggesting
that their rivals are disloyal, hypocritical, ineffective,
inexperienced and underhanded in a slew of negative television ads
that reflect the demands of a compressed, high-stakes campaign
season.
   Instead of inspirational biographies and upbeat messages,
viewers in many of the 20 states holding Super Tuesday contests are
seeing ``attack ads'' that quickly escalate from issue-oriented
criticism to personal digs cutting to the bone of campaign themes
and identities.
   Analysts give numerous reasons for the unusually early
predominance of sharply negative television ads. Chief among them
are the central role of TV, the candidates' needs to differentiate
themselves from their rivals and the do-or-die nature of Super
Tuesday for several campaigns.

   Democratic voters are ``wrestling with an
ancient cultural barrier,'' says Jesse Jackson, and when the
wrestling ends in 20 Super Tuesday states this week, the black
presidential candidate may behold some eye-catching results.
   Barriers do seem to be bending, but the main ingredient for a
strong Jackson performance is the clumping among three white
candidates in a year that Jackson expects to take home
90-plus-percent of the black vote.
   ``No one can be so certain what's going to happen Tuesday,''
Jackson says, but adds: ``I can only say that I'm reaching out. ...
My sense is there is a higher comfort level'' among white voters

   After he was forced to leave Iraq in 1983, Abu Nidal kept an

an office tower there, according to a Central Intelligence Agency

   U.S. diplomats began pressuring the Polish government behind the

its staff to leave the country. A similar operation was closed in

some environmentalists are worrying that it was simply a matter of

   ``In a sense we did,'' said Lon Burnam, clean air consultant for

that the one that we went to is less harmful than the one that we

   When publisher Jorge de Herralde saw
novels bearing his Anagrama Logo in all three bookstores on
Lanzarote Island, he knew things were looking up for serious books
in Spain.
   ``Eight or nine years ago, it would have been impossible to find
good novels and essays in bookstores in provincial towns, let alone
on a small island in the Canaries,'' he said. ``It makes me
optimistic about the future of Spanish publishing.''
   Silvia Lluis, director of the year-old publishing company Circe
Ediciones, agrees that now is the time for quality books in Spain.
   ``There's a new, discriminating reading public that wants more
than the pulp best sellers,'' she said. ``They've read Marguerite
Yourcenar, and they don't want to settle for less.''
   The increased interest in quality books in a country where
newspaper readership is the lowest in Europe comes more than a
decade after the demise of Gen. Francisco Franco's dictatorship and
his 36 years of cultural and intellectual repression.
   The change has been fairly sudden. It is due in part to Spain's
1986 entry into the European Common Market which has broadened many
horizons. De Herralde also credited the newfound market to a
decline in ideological topics and obscure experimental writing by
some authors, and a return to the narrative _ both in Spanish and
foreign literature.
   Those in the publishing industry, centered mainly in this
northeastern port city, say Spaniards are now looking beyond their
borders, learning foreign languages and reading good books.
   A 1985 study initiated by the Ministry of Culture on Spanish
cultural behavior said that although 80 percent of Spanish
households possessed books, mainly encyclopedias or technical
manuals, only 41 percent read any of them.
   The study also showed that the Spanish reading public is heavily
concentrated in Madrid and in Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the
capital _ the the most developed and educated regions of Spain. The
illiteracy rate is 7.4 percent in a population of 36.8 million,
third highest in the 12-nation European Economic Community after
Greece and Portugal. Results also revealed that fewer than 11
percent of Spaniards ever set foot inside a library.
   ``Many people are still afraid to go inside bookstores or
libraries because they think they're only for intellectuals,'' said
Manuel Ripoll, producer of ``Entrelineas'' (``Between the Lines''),
Spanish state TV's new literary program. ``That's why so many of
the books sold in Spain are purchased at corner newsstands.''
   De Herralde pointed out that the biggest single bookseller in
Spain _ with items ranging from how-to manuals to poetry
collections _ is El Corte Ingles, the country's only department
store chain.
   Translations of foreign works _ primarily American and English
books _ make up about 70 percent of the lists of Anagrama, Circe
and other quality houses. The other 30 percent is devoted to the
works of established or new Spanish authors.
   Five years ago de Herralde, a 52-year-old former industrial
engineer, took a chance on John Kennedy Toole's ``A Confederacy of
Dunces,'' a cult novel published in the United States when the
unknown author's mother brought the manuscript to a publisher after
his suicide. The book earned the author a posthumous Pulitzer Prize
in 1981.
   The Spanish edition has gone into 22 printings and has sold
100,000 copies. The translation into Catalan, a language spoken by
more than 5 million people in the northeastern part of the country,
is due out in April.
   Pilar Raola, director of the Catalan publishing house Editorial
Portic, said many Spanish-reading Catalans preferred to wait to
read a translation of a foreign novel in their own language,
resulting in a similar upsurge in Catalan-language publishing.
   According to the Spanish Association of Book Publishers, 38,814
titles were published in Spain in 1986 of which 7,483 were novels
and essays. The average press run for a Spanish novel is between
3,500 and 4,000 copies.
   Felix de Azua's ``Diary of a Humiliated Man'' has gone into its
third printing at Anagrama in three months following its
publication in December after winning the firm's coveted Herralde
literary award.
   Chilean author Isabel Allende's ``Eva Luna'' and ``Belle du
Seigneur'' by French author Albert Cohen have been jockeying for
first place on the best-seller list of Spain's leading newspaper El
Pais for the past six months. Five of the 10 top-selling books on
the list are by Spanish authors.
   The most successful Spanish novel this century is Jose Maria
Gironella's ``Cypresses Believe in God,'' set in the years leading
up to the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. Since its publication in the
late 1950s, the book has sold over 4 million copies.
   The burst of interest in quality fiction has led Spanish
publishing giants to set up smaller collections devoted to serious
fiction and essays, de Herralde said.
   And the nationwide Readers' Circle book club began including
quality foreign and domestic fiction several years ago at the
request of its 1.3 million members, according to spokesman Hans
Gentz.

   Pssst! Looking for unspoiled scenery,
cheap extras and good local technicians for filming on location?
   It's still a word-of-mouth proposition, but some of the world's
leading filmmakers are discovering Venezuela's steamy jungles, vast
savannahs and palm-studded beaches for shooting their exotic
location shots.
   The South American country is being promoted as a cheaper and
more accessible alternative to Brazil and a non-politicized
substitute for South Africa.
   British producer Derek Granger brought Sir Alec Guinness and
James Wilby, star of ``A Room With a View,'' to the jungles near
Canaima, 400 miles southeast of Caracas, in late January to film a
portion of ``A Handful of Dust,'' based on the novel by Evelyn
Waugh.
   The French director Alain Siritzky came last November to check
out scenery in Canaima and Caracas for the sixth movie in the
``Emmanuelle'' series, now being shot for him by a local film group.
   Last October, two episodes of the TV series ``Dynasty'' were
filmed here. They involve a jungle rescue.
   And Venezuela recently beat out Jamaica to provide various beach
sites for a series of Pepsi-Cola commercials.
   ``For directors who are interested in the kinds of scenes shot
in Brazil or Mexico or Argentina, we are unbeatable: We're the
cheapest, the freshest and we have good technicians,'' said George
Korda, a Hungarian-born Venezuelan whose company, Korda Films, is
undertaking the ``Emmanuelle'' project.
   Filmmakers attribute the growing interest in Venezuela in part
to the never-ending quest by directors for something unique and
untouched _ something that, ideally, no other director has used
before.
   ``Everybody knows about Brazil and Mexico, and they're a bit
tired of that so they're discovering Venezuela,'' said Korda.
   But Venezuela's attitude toward foreign filmmakers has also
changed, they say, along with the value of its currency. Successive
devaluations of the bolivar since 1983 have made it possible for
directors to put up actors and crewmen in three or four star hotels
for $20 a night. Extras can be hired for $13 a day _ a marvelous
wage in a nation where the urban minimum wage is $65 a month.
   Foreign directors say they have found local production companies
fully competent for back-up work. Many Venezuelans in film were
trained abroad under government scholarships.
   And Venezuela's jungles are also more accessible, because they
are smaller than Brazil's vast Amazon basin and closer to
population centers.
   ``Our location manager said it would be easier (to film here)
than work in the heart of Brazil,'' Granger said in an interview.
``We had only 10 days to film. We needed good immediate facilities,
good hotels and easy means of transport.''
   And the government, which has been interested in promoting
tourism ever since oil prices fell, is content to see the movie
people come, local promoters say.
   However, some have found the government difficult to work with.
The arts crew of ``A Handful of Dust'' could not get the Venezuelan
Guayana Corp., which controls the national park in which Canaima is
located, to provide the animals. So they instead had to rent
parrots, monkeys and deer from a local landowner.
   But there's another message that Venezuelan promoters are
beginning to whisper: ``Stable government, no racial problems.''
   Except for the animals, some Venezuelan landscapes are dead
ringers for the South African savannah.
   This new selling point could take on more weight as more
studios, including the 120 Americans banded together in the
industry pressure group Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, seek
to avoid possible commercial backlashes from filming in South
Africa.
   ``There are places here that look just like South Africa, only
we're much closer and we don't have racial problems or a civil
war,'' said Rolando Haiek, whose company, 5247 Producciones, was
hired by Granger to provide everything needed locally for ``A
Handful of Dust.''
   5247 Productions now hopes to get a Canadian production company
to film ``Miss Helen,'' a story set in South Africa, in Venezuela
instead.

<TEXT>
   Anwar Sadat won the Nobel Peace Prize and
the admiration of the West with a leadership that dared break new
political and social ground, including making peace with Israel.
   The same self-assured decisiveness made the warrior president a
hero to his countrymen in the early 1970s, especially after the
1973 Arab-Israeli war in which he could claim his bold moves led to
an Egyptian victory over Israel in the Sinai Peninsula.
   But in the years leading up to his assassination Oct. 6, 1981,
as Sadat's temperament changed, many Egyptians turned against him,
even though he remained widely admired abroad.
   Those latter years are the ones being recalled now as members of
Sadat's family return to a courtroom March 12 for a hearing to
determine whether the government can confiscate property it claims
was acquired through corruption.
   Although the case against Sadat's brother Esmat and 10 members
of his immediate family is connected only remotely to Anwar, the
late president's detractors contend that Sadat's presidency is on
trial. They contend that Sadat's open-door economic policy led to
the kind of corrupt practices his brother was tried for and
convicted of.
   ``Corruption increased in President Sadat's time,'' said Khaled
Mohieddin, head of the opposition National Unionist Progressive
Party, an umbrella of Marxists and Nasserites. ``People just
grabbed money and ran away.''
   Like Sadat, Mohieddin was a member of the Revolution Command
Council that ended the monarchy of King Farouk in 1952. The council
acted under Gamal Abdel Nasser, republican Egypt's first president
and Sadat's predecessor.
   During the Sadat presidency, Esmat Sadat allegedly amassed an
illegal fortune despite later-disclosed efforts by the president to
stop his brother's profiting on their relationship.
   His activities were so blatant that on the first anniversary of
Sadat's assassination by Moslem extremists, President Hosni Mubarak
reportedly told him: ``Your stench has spread throughout the
country. I'm not going to protect anyone.''
   A little later, he was arrested and tried. Esmat Sadat, three
sons and seven other family members were convicted on 24 counts of
influence peddling, black marketeering and bribery.
   Their property was sequestered, and Esmat and three of his sons
served nine months of a one-year prison term. The new court case is
for confiscation of their wealth, estimated at $8.2 million.
   ``Esmat and his children were a dangerous burden on Anwar Sadat
in his life and after his death,'' said Moussa Sabry, a Sadat
confidant who writes a regular column at the government newspaper
Al-Akhbar.
   ``When you see they traded, and stole, and have millions, of
course they used his name. ... People used to be intimidated into
doing what they wanted. ... Some people say he was not responsible
for his brothers but of course it affects.''
   Esmat's trial spotlighted ``infitah,'' the open-door economic
policy that Sadat came up with in the mid-1970s. With its
loopholes, it created many Esmats, a class of the newly rich.
Additionally, it created public frustration over the massive influx
of flashy imports of luxury goods, from cars to designer
sunglasses, that were unaffordable for most Egyptians.
   The policy served mainly private interests and foreign companies
in joint ventures. Many wealthy businessmen, feeling Egypt's
present economic pinch, look back with regret at Sadat's
initiatives.
   ``Egypt was not being transformed from a planned to a market
economy but to a supermarket economy,'' wrote Mohammed Heikal, a
close adviser to Nasser and Sadat until they fell out over foreign
policy.
   ``The disrupting effect which this transformation had on
Egyptian society can hardly be exaggerated,'' Heikal wrote in
``Autumn of Fury,'' a bitter book about Sadat's assassination that
was banned in Egypt for two years after its publication in 1983.
   In the book's introduction, Heikal said he collected much of his
information from fellow prisoners after Sadat jailed him and 1,535
others in a crackdown on domestic dissenters a month before his
death.
   Some watched closely to see whether the decision permitting the
sale of the book would start a downgrading of Sadat's memory. But
Anwar Sadat remains an honored figure in government eyes, because
the bullets that killed him did little to change the governing
system he had built.
   His portrait remains posted on a major suburban road behind a
guest house the government gave his family. His tomb in another
suburb shares a place of honor with that of Egypt's unknown
soldier. The largest station of Cairo's new subway system, the
first named, is ``Sadat Station.''
   Nevertheless, much of the popular local support Sadat had won by
making peace with Israel and his vow of ``no more war'' was eroded
by the wave of arrests in September 1981. Moreover, he shut down a
half-dozen Moslem and Coptic Christian publications, withdrew state
recognition of Coptic Pope Shenouda III and banished him to a
desert monastery, thereby alienating Egypt's 6 million Copts.
   A year after Sadat's death, Esmat's trial came as a welcome
change to many people in a country where authorities often turned a
blind eye to dubious acts by the powerful. Eager crowds outside the
courthouse cheered ``long live justice'' on hearing days, and when
the verdict and sentence were read, about 300 spectators in the
courtroom burst into applause.
   Commenting on Sadat's legacy after seven years, Moussa Sabry
said, ``The Egyptians, and not only the Egyptians but the Arab
people, have started to realize that this man's view was ahead of
Egypt's thinking. He actually managed to create peace between Egypt
and Israel, and to get back our land.''
   In her recently published memoirs, Sadat's widow Jihan wistfully
conceded that Sadat's star has not shone as brightly with his
compatriots as she feels it should have.
   ``Someday, Egyptians will recognize what Anwar did for his
country and give him his rightful place in history,'' she wrote.
``With patience, I wait.''

   Robert Gobinot isn't given much chance in his
candidacy for the office of president, but he's getting some
attention with his idea to restore an orchard owner's benefit
dating back to the French Revolution.
   In 1791, owners of orchards were granted the right to distill
tax-free each year 2.6 gallons of eau de vie, the alcoholic
beverage that is sipped after meals and called ``pousse cafe'' or
``digestif.'' The distillers would pay no tax so long as they
didn't offer it for sale.
   The license to distill was passed on from one generation to
another until 1961 when a new law canceled the right to inherit the
license.
   Eau de vie comes in various forms, depending on the region. In
Normandy, for example, it is made from apples and is called
calvados. In Alsace in eastern France, pears and plums are used; in
the Auvergne region of central France it is made from hazelnuts.
   ``When my mother died six months ago, I inherited her orchard,''
said Gobinot, ``but the license died with her and so I can no
longer make eau de vie without paying tax.''
   Gobinot's bucolic campaign headquarters is his 60-acre sheep
farm in the village of Chezeaux in the Haut-Marne department of
eastern France.
   His name does not figure in the opinion polls, he has no
political party machine behind him, or image advisers cultivating a
presidential package for the balloting April 24 and runoff May 8.
   But he has been getting his message out and has already received
letters of support from 500 mayors, the minimum necessary to
declare his candidacy formally.
   ``Our method of raising support is by word of mouth,'' Gobinot
said in a telephone interview.
   But he thinks it unlikely that he will become Francois
Mitterrand's successor in the presidency. He is simply using the
elections, he said, to defend what he sees as an honorable rural
tradition.
   Others, however, compare the lot of French eau de vie distillers
to the tale of Tristan and Isolde, or the myth of the eternal
return, because the argument to restore the inherited licenses
resurfaces from time to time.
   In a country that has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in
the world, the abolition of the right to distill tax-free eau de
vie might seem like a good thing. But Gobinot disagrees.
   He wants to clean up the image of the ``bouilleurs de cru,'' as
eau de vie makers are known.
   ``We want people to realize that we are not just purveyors of
alcoholism,'' he said.
   Gobinot maintains that the major distilleries are more to blame
for the problem of alcoholism than farmers who make a couple of
gallons out of plums or apples.
   According to Gobinot, 2.11 million gallons of alcohol were drunk
in France last year, of which just 15,840 gallons were homemade eau
de vie.
   ``This shows how ridiculous the argument is,'' he said. ``We
make less than 1 percent of the total consumption in France.''
   Gobinot emphasizes that traditional rural skills, and therefore
jobs, are disappearing as a result of the 1961 law. Only a handful
of craftsmen making wooden barrels remain and the fruit trees are
no longer pruned as they used to be, he said.
   The distiller with his ``alambic ambulant'' (mobile still),
going from village to village in Normandy to turn apples into
calvados, was once a familiar figure.
   ``The farmer who picks his own fruit is proud to distill his own
eau de vie,'' Gobinot said. ``He does everything himself and is
making a natural product.
   ``I drink very little myself. But I take great pleasure in
offering a glass of friendship when people come to my house.''

   In less than a generation, Japan has slashed its
infant death rate to the lowest in the world, thanks to a formula
that combines intensive prenatal care with government policy.
   But Japan also has one of the world's highest abortion rates,
which could help in keeping figures low for the infant-death rate.
   The officially reported infant mortality rate, in any case, has
fallen from a high of more than 60 deaths per 1,000 in the years
after World War II to 4.9 per 1,000 in 1987 _ meaning that of every
1,000 babies born, 995.1 will live to their first birthdays.
   No other nation comes close. The United States lags far behind
with a rate of 10.6 per 1,000. Finland and Sweden rank second
behind Japan, with 6.0, according to 1986 figures.
   Experts list several things that led to Japan's low rate:
   _A literate society eager for medical advice.
   _A system of universal health insurance.
   _A Maternal and Child Health Handbook, standard issue for every
pregnant woman since World War II, which has 58 pages of health
records and advice on pregnancy and child care from birth to age 6.
   A typical Japanese mother is a married woman in her late 20s _
the safest ages for childbearing _ and she is pregnant with her
first or second child. The handbook tells her what to eat, how much
milk to drink and when to visit a doctor. By the time labor pains
begin she will have undergone about a dozen prenatal checkups, two
of them courtesy of the government.
   ``A Japanese mother is very interested in her own health and the
child to be born,'' said Dr. Kazuaki Miyagishima of the health
ministry's Maternal and Child Health Division. ``She follows
intensive prenatal care.''
   Like virtually all mothers of her generation, she gives birth in
a delivery room. Her hospital stay lasts a week, giving doctors
time to keep watch on the baby. Insurance takes care of most of the
costs, which usually run about 200,000 yen ($1,560). Depending on
need, the government will pay the rest, and add 100,000 yen ($780)
as a gift.
   Officials provide coupons for free checkups for the baby and
send a public health nurse to the home. Legions of volunteers pay
monthly house calls on rural newborns and report their progress to
local officials.
   But abortions are not figured in the official infant mortality
rate; the abortion figures themselves are difficult to establish.
   Japan's registered abortion rate is 17.1 per 1,000 women of
childbearing age, near the top among Western nations. Doctors say,
however, the real figure could be two to four times higher, because
not all abortions are reported to the government as required by
law. Adding the doctors' estimates of unreported abortions would
put Japan well ahead of the United States, which had a 1983 rate of
27.4 per 1,000.
   Officials say the hidden abortions take place among teen-agers.
While they accounted for only 5.4 percent of registered abortions
in 1986, that number has been rising along with teen pregnancies.
   Babies born to teens and women over 35 are at highest risk for
late fetal and early neonatal deaths. Women over 35 are almost
twice as likely to have infants with congenital defects.
   In Japan, the two groups of high-risk mothers account for 42
percent of registered abortions and only 8.8 percent of live
births. They are the only groups among whom abortion is increasing.
   ``Looking at the national statistics, it seems there could be a
link between a high rate of abortion among high-risk mothers and
the infant mortality rate,'' said Dr. Eikkichi Matsuyama, director
of obstetrics and gynecology at Tokyo's Kosei Nenkin Hospital, when
asked why the figures showed infant mortality at the bottom and
abortions near the top. ``It's a connection I've never thought of
until now. But it's not illogical.''
   Japan's Eugenic Protection Law allows abortions even as late as
the second trimester of pregnancy to ``prevent the increase of
inferior descendants and to protect the life of the mother.''
   ``Abortion is quite a big program in Japanese family planning,''
said Haruo Konagai of the Japan Family Planning Association.
``One-fourth of Japanese women have experienced abortions.''
   Matsuyama and others say that preventing high-risk births is not
the key to lowering infant mortality. They say it's an incidental
factor in an already successful program.
   But the government is pushing programs for telephone counseling
and sex education in schools to lower the teen-age abortion rate,
Miyagishima said.
   ``In general, mother and child health is on a high standard
already,'' he said. ``It is a very hard task to find a (new)
target.''

   One of the reasons given for so
many healthy babies in Japan is the Tender Care Corps, an
organization of volunteer women who visit new mothers and their
babies in their own homes.
   The corps operates on the tradition that neighbors look out for
each other. It mobilizes 80,000 mothers who volunteer to keep tabs
on the health of 2 million households with children in Japan's
outlying cities and hamlets.
   Here in Yamato village, a collection of small farms and quarries
perched among mountaintop forests, volunteer Hatsuko Hirayama
visits six families every month. She makes her rounds on foot over
steep paths and concrete-paved roads 60 miles west of Tokyo.
   ``Our purpose is to see that healthy babies are born,''
explained Mrs. Hirayama, a woman in her fifties with children of
her own. ``The public health nurse can't always visit homes, so I
do.''
   One of the mothers she visits is Yoshimi Hirayama, a distant
relative in this town of 1,890 people. The visits began when the
24-year-old housewife became pregnant with her second child, which
turned out to be a daughter, Michiko, who now is now 10 months old.
   ``She told me to breast feed,'' Yoshimi said. ``She told me to
eat things that would build bones _ small fish, lots of milk.
   ``She's like another mother. When I had my first baby I didn't
know anybody here, but I could go to Mrs. Hirayama and ask her
anything.''
   Yoshimi's pregnancy was normal. She followed her doctor's
instructions to undergo health checks every three weeks during the
first two trimesters, then biweekly and weekly until delivery. In
between came prenatal care and childbirth classes at the village
hall.
   In April, after she gave birth to Michiko, a public health nurse
stopped by to check on the mother and baby after their return from
the hospital. Mrs. Hirayama took it from there.
   ``Any teeth?'' she asked on a recent visit, pulling down
Michiko's lower lip. ``Are you hiding them?''
   Her notes on Michiko's diet, bedtimes and skin color are turned
over to the health nurse, who evaluates them and recommends
doctor's visits or looks in on the baby herself, if necessary.
   Mrs. Hirayama fills in monthly visit cards for each child she
sees on her rounds until the child turns 6. Then it is time for
school teachers to keep an eye out.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Burt has been a guest on a hit
TV variety show, sung with a West Berlin rock group, sold potato
pancakes on Bonn's main square, and gets his name and picture in
the papers.
   That may not be unusual for a celebrity, but it is for an
ambassador.
   It's a ``fantastic opportunity,'' says U.S. Ambassador Burt, to
reach 20 million ordinary West Germans.
   Since taking up his post here in September 1985, Burt has become
a regular fixture in West Germany's news media and on television.
   News stories about him range from the birth of his son
Christopher last year to his constant efforts to present the Reagan
administration's message.
   ``The public affairs dimension of diplomacy is growing more
important,'' the 41-year-old diplomat, a former New York Times
reporter, said in an interview with The Associated Press in his
Bonn office.
   Burt made it clear he feels that reaching out to ordinary West
Germans is a major part of his job.
   ``In a democratic country you have, in a way, two
constituencies, one the government which you are accredited to, but
secondly you have public opinion which has an impact on the
government.''
   ``There's been a certain interest in a younger ambassador,''
Burt said. ``To some extent I think I've taken advantage of that
interest to try to project a fun, open-minded, dynamic image of the
United States.''
   At the age of 38, he became the youngest U.S. ambassador in West
German history. He took over the post from Arthur Burns, who was
then 81 and known for his reserved, formal ways.
   Burt said he's made a special effort to ``win over'' West
Germany's young people, tens of thousands of whom took to the
streets in 1983 to protest the installation of U.S. missiles in the
country.
   ``They don't remember CARE packages, the Marshall Plan and the
Berlin Airlift,'' Burt said, referring to vital U.S. postwar relief
and aid programs. ``They remember Vietnam.''
   Among Burt's most heavily publicized exploits was his singing
stint with the West Berlin rock group at a recording studio in
January 1986.
   Articles and pictures filled West German newspapers afterward.
   ``That was not sought after,'' he said. ``I was a little bit
naive at that point.''
   This past Nov. 28, Burt appeared on a television stunt and
variety show called ``Wetten, Dass'' (Will You Bet That ...).
   The superstar moderator, Thomas Gottschalk, asked Burt: ``Can
you imagine that one day you won't just be called `your
excellence,' but also Mr. President _ and I can still call you
Rick?''
   Speaking in slow, halting German, Burt responded with a smile:
``I will be president when you are the federal chancellor (West
Germany's leader).''
   Asked in the interview about that appearance, Burt replied:
``Here's 20 million people who are never going to get a chance to
meet an American ambassador.'' He was, he said, a ``fantastic
opportunity to project a positive image.''
   Burt lost his bet on a stunt on the Saturday night show. So,
three weeks later, as agreed before the TV audience, he went Bonn's
main square and sold potato pancakes in a pouring rain to raise
money for charity.
   Sometimes, Burt's pronouncements, especially on U.S. foreign
policy, have brought criticism from West Germans.
   In a full-page guest essay printed in the influential magazine
Der Spiegel on Feb. 22, Burt expounded on the idea that the NATO
allies must share with the United States the risks of a nuclear a
war.
   The contribution, printed in German, brought a sharp retort the
following week from Egon Bahr, the 66-year-old arms control expert
of the opposition Social Democratic Party.
   ``He finds it simply unreasonable,'' Bahr wrote, ``that the
United States should remain a target for nuclear weapons, while
`Europe is freed from the burden of the stationing of nuclear
arms.' I don't.''
   Bahr continued: ``The family that lives near the border with the
German Democratic Republic (East Germany) during any conflict runs
an incomparably bigger risk than a family in Iowa.''
   During the interview, Burt was asked whether he looked forward
to overseeing the removal of the intermediate-range nuclear
missiles from West Germany after ratification of the U.S.-Soviet
missile accord.
   Burt responded with a laugh and said: ``It's an interesting
question because before coming to Germany, when I was assistant
secretary of state for Europe, I worked very, very hard to put them
in. So I haven't really focused on taking them out.''

   When Miriam Birch left home to join the
circus, she went all the way to the Soviet Union.
   For a National Geographic special, Birch and her camera crew
spent nine weeks following circuses across the Soviet Union, which
has more such extravaganzas than any other country.
   The one-hour ``Inside the Soviet Circus,'' produced and written
by Birch, will be broadcast Wednesday on PBS. Theodore Bikel
narrates.
   The circus is a part of everyday life in the USSR and attracts
more than 70 million people a year. More than 100 troupes, all
government-supported, travel the vast country from Leningrad to
Vladivostok.
   It was in the Ukraine that Birch found one of the stars for the
special, Oleg Popov. For 40 years he has clowned in a Soviet
one-ring circus. His humor is universal and cuts across all
international barriers.
   ``The Russian circus is a world unto itself,'' said Birch. ``You
don't need to know the language to get the jokes. It's exciting,
it's colorful. And it's very good circus. The government doesn't
spare any expense. They want the people to enjoy it.''
   The tradition of the Russian circus goes back many years to the
wandering juggler, trained bears, Gypsies and tightrope walkers.
   ``The European circus came to Russia at the time of Catherine
the Great,'' she said. ``She ordered horses from England. A certain
gentleman brought not only riding horses, but trick horses as well.
Catherine was very taken with the horses and the man. She had a
circus building erected in St. Petersburg, which is now Leningrad.
   ``The Russian circuses are always one ring and the aerialists
work without a net. They emphasize artistry, not danger. The clowns
come on between the acts to distract the audience while the props
are being moved. The clowns are very skilled at mocking what just
happened.''
   Although she calls it one of the most interesting experiences of
her life, Birch said, ``I was happy to leave. I'd also be happy to
go back. It's just the thought of settling down in one of those
exotic locales. They're never quite as exotic as they look from the
outside.
   ``I'd much rather capture their essence on film than live there.
I like going there and coming back.''
   Traveling to exotic and remote areas of the world is not new for
Birch. In the past, she has written and produced Geographic
specials on pandas in China, horses in Ireland and the living
treasures of Japan, Egypt and Jerusalem.
   She was interviewed the day before leaving for the island of
Bali and Shanghai, China, to research possible specials. She was
accompanied by Thomas Skinner of WQED Pittsburgh and Dennis Kane of
the National Geographic Society, who are co-executive producers of
the specials.
   ``Both Bali and Shanghai are shrouded in romance and
mysticism,'' she said. ``Bali would be a cultural show emphasizing
the arts, puppet theater and dance. All of the arts on Bali are
performed as offerings to the gods.
   ``The theme for Shanghai would be its role as a window through
which we saw China, and China saw the world. Shanghai has been
China's most important port, from the Opium Wars to the birthplace
of Mao's communist revolution to once again being the place where
China meets the world.''

   GOODBYE ELLIOT _ NBC's ``St. Elsewhere'' is leaving the air
after five years, but at least one of its characters may leave a
little early. Dr. Elliot Axelrod, the overweight resident played by
Stephen Furst, will have a heart attack in the fourth episode from
last. Nobody's saying if he dies, but the show's called ``Requiem
for a Heavyweight.'' Three years ago, Furst was featured in a
touching show with the late Florence Halop, who as Mrs. Hufnagel
died. Mrs. Hufnagel had been a hypochondriac and a constant thorn
to Axelrod, yet a deep bond developed between them. Another
resident, Dr. Peter White, played by Terence Knox, was shot to
death and Dr. Robert Caldwell, played by Mark Harmon, died of AIDS
after Harmon left the show.

<HEAD>The Japanese Gift To The Union Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese economic competition with the United
States is often viewed negatively, especially by autoworkers hurt
by imports. But the Japanese have also come bearing gifts.
   They raised levels of quality. They forced competitors to rid
themselves of waste at every level from plant floor to chairman's
office. They compelled U.S. management to get off its duff and
innovate.
   But their biggest contribution might be in management-labor
relations, at least in the automobile industry. And it was in that
industry that relations had, in effect, become proceedings in a
divorce case.
   For complex reasons, workers and executives had become such foes
that it might have been better had they never spoken to each other.
Each depended for survival on making cars. But they fought each
other. They were rigidly set.
   In competitive markets, rigidity leads to death. Competition,
according to Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, is a ``dynamic
discovery procedure.'' It never stops; if one company ceases to
innovate, another surely will.
   In the United States automotive industry, unions helped
frustrate innovation by inflexible work rules, job classifications
and resistance to technological change, while simultaneously
insisting on higher wages.
   Attitudes began changing slowly as the Japanese, starting from a
zero base, grabbed almost a quarter of the U.S. market. And now,
according to a university report, union and management now see
salvation rather than ruin in the new way.
   The new way is Japanese, at least as it applies to labor
relations. The Japanese way, according to Thomas DiLorenzo, is for
unions to be enterprising and cooperative for the common good of
themselves and the company.
   DiLorenzo, a fellow at the Center for the Study of American
Business at St. Louis' Washington University, observes that
Japanese unions have a strong interest in strengthening the
competitive position of the employer.
   National unions seldom interfere in local decisions. Members
recognize that job security is possible only in a healthy company.
They accept transfers to different areas of the plant. They perform
a variety of jobs. They take pay cuts, in the form of reduced
bonuses, as an alternative to mass layoffs.
   DiLorenzo feels American workers are increasingly receptive to
such procedures, citing the Japanese-style labor relations already
practiced at the New United Motor Manufacturing plant, a
Toyota-General Motors joint venture.
   That plant, at Fremont, Calif., had been an intense headache for
GM, which closed it in 1982 with the loss of 5,000 jobs.
   Between 1963 and that year, there were four shutdowns for
sickouts and strikes. Absenteeism forced the assembly line to
close. Drugs and alcohol were just two of many problems. Labor
relations were acrimonious, almost violent.
   Inevitably, the productivity level at the plant was incredible.
It took an average of 34 manhours of labor to produce a vehicle,
compared to only 20 hours to produce a Toyota. And the final
product sometimes was a mess.
   Cooperation is now a two-way street, according to DiLorenzo.
Management has made written promises of job security and has agreed
to take salary cuts before laying off workers.
   In addition, union and management have promised to work together
to resolve problems arising from layoffs, production schedule
changes, major investments and day-to-day decisions once left
entirely to management.
   The United Auto Workers union has made other unusual concessions
to help with productivity and profits. It agreed to reduce job
classes from more than 200 to three, eliminating featherbedding. It
allowed workers to be trained for several jobs, allowing
manufacturing flexibility.
   The two once-vicious enemies also adopted the Japanese technique
of ``kaisan,'' under which workers and management have regular
discussions on how to perform jobs more efficiently for their
mutual benefit.
   Already, says DiLorenzo, evidence that parts of the experiment
might become fixtures in U.S. management-labor relations can be
found in the UAW contracts with Ford and GM in 1987, which permit
an unprecedented degree of cooperation.
   There is recognition that labor and management are not competing
against one another, says DiLorenzo. ``The competition lies
elsewhere,'' he says. As it always has.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Wherever he goes, a small army goes with him.
Virtually everything he does in public is planned, scripted and
rehearsed. Even a visit to a club two blocks from the White House
follows an elaborate scenario. That's the insulating apparatus of
the presidency today. It wasn't always that way.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Truman liked to take a walk every
morning, a habit he didn't abandon even after Franklin D. Roosevelt
died.
   Promptly at 7 a.m., the president, a fedora on his head and
usually a cane in his hand, would set off from the White House at a
brisk 120 paces a minute.
   The route varied _ sometimes across Lafayette Square and up
Connecticut Avenue, sometimes on a circuit of the Washington
Monument and Lincoln Memorial.
   Taxi drivers would shout their hellos. Sometimes the president
paused to sign an autograph for a tourist.
   Often a reporter or two showed up, joining the president and his
brace of Secret Service men.
   A few weeks ago, President Reagan went two blocks along one of
Truman's walking routes to dedicate the newly rebuilt Army and Navy
Club. Here is what happened:
   When the motorcade of nine White House cars and an ambulance,
escorted by District of Columbia police cars and motorcycles,
pulled up at the club at 10:30 a.m., the president's limousine
pulled into an unadorned side entrance leading to a loading dock.
   Club officials had wanted Reagan to come in the elegant front
door, but a White House advance team had vetoed the idea in a
meeting with club officers two weeks earlier. Too dangerous.
   Stepping from his limo, the president walked to a freight
elevator, carpeted for the occasion, through a loading dock area
that had been cleared of clutter.
   From the elevator, the White House had first proposed that the
president pass through the first-floor kitchen. Club officers,
however, wanted the president to see some of the memorabilia _ the
cannon seized in the Spanish-American War, the preliminary casting
of the Iwo Jima memorial, the busts of Truman and Eisenhower _ that
line the long second-floor hall they call The Parade. So they ended
up greeting the president on the second floor.
   In a routine that had been rehearsed for days, Brig. Gen. James
D. Hittle, the retired Marine officer who is the club president,
was supposed to open a door to guide Reagan into the main ballroom.
   As they reached the door, Gray Terry, deputy director of the
Office of Presidential Advance, whispered to Hittle, ``Not in here!
The door's locked!'' Hittle opened another door into the ballroom,
a few yards down the hall. Then the president was taken down a
circular staircase to pass through a receiving line of club
officials and their wives, and to cut a ribbon.
   Hittle then escorted the president into the dining room. The
other officers had already taken their places.
   It had all been rehearsed, with Terry playing the part of
Reagan. The second of the two steps that led up to the dais had
been marked with adhesive tape as a precaution against stumbling.
The white drapes in the windows, normally drawn back, were lowered.
The window at the end, where the president would speak, was
protected by a bulletproof glass shield.
   ``In the old days, I'm told, the Army and Navy Club often
invited their neighbor, the president, to all their parties,''
Reagan said in his remarks. ``I've also heard that Benjamin
Harrison and Grover Cleveland walked over for a toddy or two. Oh,
for the good old days.''
   Those days are gone forever.
   This simple presidential visit, planned since the club's
invitation was accepted months before, had required the initial
meeting with 16 White House people two weeks earlier, at least two
walk-throughs, a number of rehearsals, several more meetings on the
site and constant telephone calls. For more than a week beforehand,
the White House had been working on communications for the
president and his staff. A holding room was needed for the
president, a place where he could receive or make a telephone call
if needed.
   Club officers proposed an office just off the lobby, but the
lobby was too crowded. ``The second time they were over, they
asked, `Is there a better place?','' said Hittle. Finally, they
chose a modest security room near the loading dock. Half an hour
before the president arrived, traffic on surrounding streets and
access to the building were sealed off.
   Every moment that he is before the public, the president is
backed up by a script that spells out his every motion, a staff
that looks after his protection and his image and an aerial fleet
that can carry limousines and tons of communications equipment
anywhere in the world.
   No other leader, not even the pope in Rome in some respects, is
accompanied by quite the pomp and circumstance that follow the
president of the United States wherever he goes.
   Some presidents have chafed at this structured life. It seems to
fit Reagan like a glove.
   The trappings help fend off possible danger. They keep the
president in constant touch with Washington and other world
capitals. They make his public appearances come off smoothly.
   They also insulate the leader of the world's premier democracy
from the people he leads.
   ``Every one of these guys becomes a little more isolated,'' says
Bill Gulley, former director of the White House military office,
who served under presidents from Johnson to Carter.
   ``I think the isolation of presidents is dangerous stuff,'' says
James David Barber, a Duke University political scientist and
leading student of the presidency.
   Barber says the president does not get the advice he needs
``when you have the argument going on only in a limited closed-in
coterie.''
   This is particularly true with a president, he says, ``who like
Reagan is very much tuned in to those in the same room with him _
who are right next to him.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: to him.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Not for Reagan the freedom to browse in bookstores, as French
President Francois Mitterrand likes to do, or to stroll on
Pennsylvania Avenue as Mitterrand recently did on the Champs
Elysees.
   A couple of months after his inauguration in 1981, the president
and first lady Nancy Reagan did take a walk, on a sunny March
Sunday, across Lafayette Park to attend church. The next day,
Reagan was wounded in an assassination attempt outside a Washington
hotel. He hasn't taken a walk in public since.
   Recent presidents have reacted differently to the increasing
amount of fuss and security.
   ``The only time that I ever knew a president to get out of the
corral was Johnson,'' Gulley says. ``He set his own agenda. This
guy would not only tell me what airplanes to use, he would tell me
who was going to be on the airplane. He made up the manifest.
   ``When Nixon came along, everything was orderly,'' says Gulley.
Nixon also introduced white tunics, black trousers and shiny black
hats for White House policemen. After protests and ridicule, the
officers were allowed to return to workaday police outfits. But
another Nixon innovation, the use of a Marine guard in splendid
dress uniform as doorkeeper for the West Wing, is still in effect.
   Nixon experimented with having smartly uniformed trumpeters,
their horns draped with banners, signal the arrival of the
president at social occasions. Jimmy Carter cut out the traditional
playing of ``Hail to the Chief'' altogether. Reagan, the performer
with a flare for the theatrical, brought it back.
   The president, with his background as an actor with a reputation
for taking direction well, still takes direction well.
   He has said of his Sacramento period, ``For eight years,
somebody handed me a piece of paper every night that told me what I
was going to be doing the next day.'' He has made similar
statements about his White House existence.
   At his annual summertime party for the press in Santa Barbara,
he goes by the book, entering the grounds and walking to a
specified spot, then taking a specified route through the crowd and
going at a specified time to a bandstand to make off-the-record
remarks.
   ``His time is scheduled very precisely, much more precisely than
I would have ever thought,'' says James C. McKinney, who came to
the White House last year as director of the military office.
``There was a book printed for the Gorbachev visit, and that ran
only 2{ days. The book was approximately an inch thick, a
minute-by-minute rundown of who goes where, when, who accompanies
the president, who rides in which elevator. It's the kind of a book
that we get if we even go to make a speech in Jacksonville, Fla.,
to a bunch of high school kids.''
   When the American president travels, the White House goes with
him. It's set up in the Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara, or in
Tokyo or Venice.
   ``You can get two helicopters on and get the ground crews for
them on a C-5A,'' says Gulley. ``You also take a car, a backup and
a follow-up for Secret Service. And in my time it took about 20
communicators and 6,000 pounds of communications equipment for each
stop. That would be whether he goes for 15 minutes or whether he
goes overnight.''
   Even if the president goes to a private dinner at the home of
friends, it takes a 15-car motorcade with a cluster of military and
security aides, a doctor and other staff.
   ``It's usually no problem and people expect it,'' says Gary
Foster, chief of press advance for the White House. ``Once in a
while it's an inconvenience. It's just that so many people come
with him that sometimes they have a hard time knowing what to do
with them.''
   Wherever the president travels, the Army Signal Corps sets up
its own telephone switchboard and installs special phones for all
his aides.
   No other country does exactly the same thing.
   Still, some of the other leaders come fairly close.
   When Pope John Paul II travels abroad, the Vatican flies two
bulletproof, glass-enclosed ``popemobiles'' ahead. The pontiff's
entourage numbers as many as 30 people, including top prelates,
security men, a valet and a photographer. The pope does not have
his own plane, however. He travels on chartered jets, taking
Alitalia from Rome and making the return leg on an airliner of the
country he visited.
   Mikhail Gorbachev's summit visit to Washington in December gave
Americans a chance to compare the entourages of the U.S. and Soviet
leaders.
   ``I think there are an awful lot of parallels,'' says McKinney.
``Their motorcade is even larger than ours. I have never seen
motorcades as large as the Gorbachev motorcades. The longest one
was some 50 vehicles.''
   Gorbachev took four Ilyushin jetliners with him to Washington.
KGB agents prevented a U.S. television crew from filming the
extensive wardrobe being rushed up the gangway for him and his wife.
   Although motorcades in Moscow are usually only two or three
cars, special lanes are reserved for official cars and uniformed
police often halt traffic for their passage. Members of an elite
unit wearing electric-blue shoulderboards guard the Kremlin.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels abroad on one of
three Boeing 707s reserved for top government officials. There is
no equivalent to Air Force One. Hans-Peter Gaertner, a chancellery
spokesman in Bonn, said no West German chancellor has ever taken a
limousine abroad.
   ``After the war, Konrad Adenauer adopted a modest style that was
suited to the time, and since then other chancellors have followed
suit,'' Gaertner says. ``Now that is what Germans expect of their
chancellors.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: their chancellors.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   France has a reputation for grandeur, and the Elysee Palace
provides one of the world's most splendid presidential settings,
but things are simpler when Mitterrand is traveling. He usually
flies in the supersonic Concorde, primarily as a plug for the
French aerospace industry. He gets around Paris in a short
motorcade, and streets are blocked a few minutes before he is
scheduled to pass. He generally spends the night at his Left Bank
apartment, not in the palace on the Right Bank.
   Security around British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
increased since an Irish Republican Army assassination attempt in
1984, but is still slight compared with the ring around Reagan.
   She uses one of three look-alike official limousines at home,
but when abroad rides in either a British Embassy limousine or one
supplied by her hosts. The prime minister's movements are no longer
announced publicly in advance but members of the public are free
to, for example, walk into a hotel where she is giving a speech.
   As for the U.S. president, Nixon White House aide John D.
Ehrlichman, in his book, ``Witness to Power,'' gave this summing
up: ``... we wonder at the man in the White House who is so
strangely different from the rest of us. We fail to recognize that
he is an animal which has been groomed to run a special race and
has forgotten how to do almost everything else.''
   Following a rigid schedule is nothing new to Reagan who, for the
past 20 years, has visited the same couple in Palm Springs, Calif.,
over the New Year holiday; who, during his annual California
vacation in August, routinely visits the same acquaintances in the
same order on a trip to Los Angeles.
   ``I think he's got a personality that's responsive to this type
of thing,'' says Gulley, who observes the White House now from the
vantage point of a Washington consultant.
   Even in the most rustic settings, the trappings of power are
there. On one of their Easter vacations, the Reagans helicoptered
from their hard-to-reach California ranch to a more accessible
neighboring spread to join a motorcade to go to church.
   As the helicopter landed, a Marine in dress uniform, who flies
on the 'copter to be ready to open the emergency exits if needed,
stepped out. He was joined by other Marines sent from Quantico,
Va., as a ground crew, also in dress blues for Easter.
   There they were: the Reagans, off in the Santa Ynez Mountains
living the simple life the president so often extols; the Marines
in their resplendent outfits standing at attention, saluting
smartly, as the president and first lady made their way down a
dusty tire-track road to the limousine.
   ``The Founding Fathers made one big mistake,'' says political
scientist Barber. ``They should have made Ben Franklin king and
George Washington prime minister, so that he would have had some
kind of royalty at the top to gather all of this emotion that now
feeds into our White House, all this ceremonial jazz.''
   On the other hand, Stephen Hess, a former Eisenhower and Nixon
aide now with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said,
``Let's start with the proposition that presidents do get shot at,
and on occasion killed. A lot of these trappings really have in
part a protective purpose. Secondly, the trappings of our country
are really not only not out of line with other countries, but in
some regards quite modest. The White House, for example, is
relatively small compared with the mansions and the palaces that
other heads of state live in. So we do have to put that in some
perspective.''
   In whatever perspective, all this ceremonial jazz comes to an
end for Reagan in January, when he steps aboard Air Force One for
his last flight home to California. Then the country will see how
the next president responds to it.

   Just as it is for her husband, life in public
is for Nancy Reagan a preordained venture, in which surprises are
singularly unwelcome.
   On a sightseeing tour at the 1987 economic summit in Venice, an
aide makes an ``X'' in masking tape on a cobblestone to mark where
Nancy Reagan should stop for photographers. There are no similar
marks for the mayor of Venice or the wife of Italy's prime minister.
   When she goes to Harper's Ferry, W.Va., to welcome a trainload
of make-believe comic-strip characters campaigning against drugs, a
six-person advance team, similar to the president's but smaller,
precedes her by four days.
   Her traveling party on trips abroad includes her personal
assistant, hairdresser, personal secretary, photographer, medic,
protocol officer and Secret Service agents.
   She flies on an Air Force plane, designated Executive Foxtrot
One. On a side trip from Venice to Sweden, it was an Air Force
Boeing 707 outfitted to accommodate the first lady and 40 to 44
other passengers as well as the pilots, stewards and military
communications personnel. On other trips, it is a smaller plane.
   ``Security doesn't really allow her to fly commercial,'' says
Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.
   By contrast, Bess Truman and her daughter, Margaret, used to go
from Washington to Independence, Mo., by train, paying for their
own first-class compartment. Lady Bird Johnson rode the Eastern
Airlines shuttle on shopping trips to New York. By the Nixon
administration, however, the presidential family was flying on
government planes.
   Raisa Gorbachev also gets some perks. Her clothes, hats, furs,
shoes and accouterments are something the average Soviet woman can
only dream about. And although such information is not disclosed in
the Soviet Union, it's doubtful that she pays for them. It is known
that she received gifts from Paris couturiers during the couple's
official visit to France in 1985. She also has worn creations of
Soviet designer Slava Zaitsev.
   A scene during Margaret Thatcher's 1987 re-election campaign
illustrates the difference in treatment of political spouses in
England and the United States.
   After the Thatchers, flying aboard a plane hired by the
Conservative Party, arrived at the packed Manchester Airport, the
prime minister plunged into the crowd, but her husband, Denis,
became separated from her and spent about 10 minutes wandering
around the fringes by himself. It would not have happened to Nancy
Reagan.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With so many experiments under way at the same
time, it's difficult to pinpoint television's birthplace. Among the
cities that lay claim to TV ``firsts'' is Schenectady, N.Y. There,
60 years ago, a handful of viewers witnessed the first broadcast to
television sets installed in the home.

   The flickering pink picture of a man
playing a ukulele was a small miracle in an age of wonder, all but
forgotten beyond the town once known as ``The City That Lights The
World.''
   The year was 1928, and Schenectady had grown from a sleepy
hamlet on the Erie Canal to a booming factory town where the
General Electric Co. had its headquarters and its finest research
talent.
   For two years, Ernst Fredrik Werner Alexanderson, a consulting
engineer for GE and the Radio Corporation of America, had been
tinkering with a machine that used perforated spinning disks to
transmit pictures. It was the mechanical ancestor of television.
   On Jan. 13, 1928, the first experimental television program was
broadcast from the GE lab to the Schenectady homes of Alexanderson
and two GE executives. There, scientists, company officials and
reporters gathered to peer into the pinkish light of a tiny screen,
3 inches square, mounted in a cabinet.
   The two-hour program with simulcast radio sound began with a GE
executive taking off his glasses and smoking a cigarette, followed
by a radio announcer strumming a ukulele and humming ``Ain't She
Sweet.''
   David Sarnoff, then vice president and later president of RCA,
appeared on the program and called it ``an epoch-making
development.''
   The event ``heralded another human conquest of space,'' said a
front-page story in the New York Times. It was hailed as ``the
first absolute proof of the possibility of connecting homes
throughout the world by sight as they have already been connected
by voice,'' the article continued.
   This year, WRGB, the Schenectady station which claims that day
as its birthday, is celebrating with a series of parties and
programs commemorating 60 years of television history.
   ``We're very proud of that heritage,'' says Terry Walden, WRGB's
program manager and producer of a historical documentary on the
station. ``We're the only station that can trace its history back
that far.''
   Actually, the birthdate and birthplace of television are quite
indistinct in history books. ``Television is one of the hardest
areas to pinpoint `firsts' in,'' says Eliot Sizowitch, a specialist
in radio and television history at the Smithsonian Institution.
``There were just so many experiments going on at the same time.''
   Independent American inventor Charles Francis Jenkins produced
the world's first working television and demonstrated it in
Washington, D.C., in 1925. A comedy skit was broadcast from New
Jersey to the Bell Telephone labs in New York City in April 1927.
Westinghouse scientist Vladimir Zworykin developed the first
electronic television system, which ultimately replaced the
mechanical scanners, in the 1920s.
   But the demonstration in January 1928 in Schenectady apparently
was the first broadcast to television sets installed in homes,
according to the reference book, ``Famous First Facts.''
   The GE station was known as W2XB when it got its first federal
license and started a regular program schedule in May 1928, with
farm and weather reports three afternoons a week. It was the
world's first regular television program schedule, according to
``Famous First Facts.''
   From there, WRGB boasts a series of ``firsts'' in television
history. It televised the first ``remote'' broadcast (outside the
studio), with an August 1928 live telecast of Gov. Alfred E. Smith
accepting the Democratic nomination for president at the state
Capitol in Albany.
   The following month, the station televised the first play, a
blood-and-guts drama called ``The Queen's Messenger,'' complete
with props and sound effects.
   At the time, there were still only four households equipped with
the 3-inch-screen TV sets.
   The first transatlantic telecast was made when the image of
Professor August Carolus of Leipzig, Germany, was transmitted from
Schenectady to Berlin in 1931.
   In 1939, WRGB and WNBC in New York City were linked by a series
of relay towers down through the Catskill Mountains and Hudson
Valley, thus forming the first television network. The visit of the
King and Queen of England to the New York World's Fair in 1939 was
beamed live to Schenectady.
   ``The World's Fair did more to publicize TV than anything
else,'' Walden said in an interview at WRGB's 40,000-square-foot
studio complex in suburban Niskayuna. ``GE had a huge exhibit.
Thousands of people went through and saw themselves on television
for the first time.''
   WRGB, which switched its network affiliation to CBS in 1981,
became the first NBC affiliate in 1939. It aired the first complete
opera on TV in 1943 with a performance of ``Hansel and Gretel.''
   Ernie Tetrault, anchorman of WRGB's evening news, became the
station's first full-time staff announcer in 1951. His 37 years
with WRGB make Tetrault the longest-tenured anchorman in the
country, says News Manager Gary Whittaker.
   ``There was little emphasis on news in the early days,'' says
Tetrault. ``It was pretty much rip-and-read _ we mainly depended on
newsreel services and the Associated Press.
   ``For example, one day back in the '50s there was a big fire at
the main GE plant, right near the studio,'' says Tetrault. ``Our
news manager looked out the window and said, `Hey, there's a fire
at GE! Get AP on the phone and see if we can get something on it.'''
   When WRGB's lone cameraman shot a story, it took hours to
process the film. ``He'd have to string it on sawhorses to dry,''
says Tetrault. ``It would take all afternoon to do what takes
minutes with modern video equipment.''
   Now, WRGB, which has a dominant audience share in an area with
four commercial stations and two public ones, has all the latest
newsgathering gadgetry, including trucks for live remotes, nine new
electronic news cameras, and sophisticated editing equipment.
   Freedom Newspapers, Inc., which bought the station for $57
million in 1986, has pumped millions of dollars into the station
and increased the staff to 125 from 100, says General Manager David
Lynch.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Contrary to its cartoon image, the coyote is a
cunning hunter blamed for annual losses of nearly $70 million worth
of sheep. Long the bane of Western farmers, the coyote has migrated
East, filling an ecological niche created by elimination of a far
less destructive predator _ the wolf.

   The first sheep was killed on Earl Cole's farm
last March, then another, and another, and another. Within 10
months, at least 80 lambs and ewes worth $10,000 were slain on his
farm and an adjoining one.
   Predatory teeth tore the sheeps' throats or pierced their
skulls, and their soft inner organs were eaten. All clues point to
coyotes, an Old West predator whose numbers are growing in the East.
   ``It's circumstantial evidence. Nobody's actually seen a coyote
kill the sheep. But it pretty much has to be coyotes,'' says Cole,
67, who tends 100 head of sheep on his 200-acre Greene County farm.
   To convince skeptics, Cole paid a trapper $50 to prove the
coyotes existed.
   Five females have been trapped or shot near the scene of the
crimes _ rolling pasture 60 miles south of Pittsburgh, as opposed
to the high grassy plains of Wyoming or Montana.
   That's good enough for Richard Belding, land management officer
for the Pennsylvania Game Commission, who calls the evidence
``overwhelming'' and ``conclusive.''
   Before 1980, only six cases of coyotes killing sheep had been
verified in Pennsylvania. The new run-ins with farmers are proof
the coyote, preceded by its mystique and villainous reputation, has
brought its eerie yips and howls to new territory.
   A cousin of the wolf and the dog, the coyote looks like a small
German shepherd with a fox-like head, pointed nose and bushy tail
that resembles a bottle brush.
   The Eastern coyote has some wolf and dog genes, and the biggest
ones weigh 55 pounds. Its prairie-dwelling kin weighs about 30
pounds.
   Coyotes are cunning hunters, bearing no resemblance to the
hapless cartoon character Wile E. Coyote, whose comical schemes
always backfire as he vainly chases a road runner.
   Real coyotes feast on mice, rabbits, deer, carrion,
grasshoppers, fruits and berries. They also kill lambs, calves,
goats, chickens, geese, pigs, barnyard cats, llamas and other
domestic livestock. Coyotes have pilfered watermelons on California
farms. In October, coyotes killed 48 flamingos in the Los Angeles
Zoo after keepers mistakenly left the birds' pen open.
   Coyotes vanished from Pennsylvania 10,000 years ago during the
Ice Age. They began returning in the late 1890s when the practice
of clear-cutting the state's forest exterminated the wolf by
destroying its habitat. Coyotes thrive in open country.
   ``They're filling an ecological niche created when we eliminated
the wolf,'' says Dr. John George, a senior biologist at Penn State
University. ``The coyote is very resourceful. People have tried to
poison them and trap them. It's tough to get rid of every last
one.''
   ``There are coyotes in every Eastern state,'' says Helen
McGinnis, who did her master's study on coyote populations at Penn
State. ``The populations are building up and will continue to build
up. I have a lot of admiration for them. They're intelligent.
They're adaptable.''
   Biologists believe coyotes migrated from the Great Plains in a
giant arc north and east around the Great Lakes about 90 years ago.
The route took them into Ontario, then south to New England, New
York, Pennsylvania and Appalachia. Others pushed east from the
plains, while some were imported to be hunted by wolfhounds and
sportsmen, Ms. McGinnis says.
   Each year, an estimated 1 million sheep, or 10 percent of the
national stock, are killed by predators, and coyotes account for 90
percent of that, according to the USDA. The loss is valued at $70
million.
   ``It's our number one preventable loss. This is the single
largest cost of production that we think is reversible,'' says Dan
Murphy, president of the Washington-based National Wool Growers
Assocation.
   The number of sheep ranchers has dwindled from 225,000 in the
1960s to 125,000, says Dr. Clair Terrill, former director of sheep
research for the USDA. Nationally, the sheep population has fallen
from 55 million during World War II to 10 million, says Terrill,
who blames coyotes for much of the drop.
   To promote the use of mutton, Idaho sheep farmers coined this
bumper sticker: ``Eat American Lamb, 5 Million Coyotes Can't Be
Wrong.''
   Others are more blunt.
   ``I only know one good coyote, and that's a dead coyote,'' says
Rick Moore of Harrison County, Ohio, where farmers pay a bounty of
$25.
   Don Patterson, president of sheep growers association in Greene
County, Pa., calls coyotes ``a damned nuisance. They're taking
money out of our pocket.''
   The coyote has outsmarted and outlasted government attempts to
shoot, trap and poison it into oblivion. In 1972, the government
banned poison baits on federal lands, partly because non-target
animals were being killed.
   In 1983, the government allowed farmers to use poison collars on
sheep if they met two dozen restrictions to protect the
environment. So far, the collars have been approved in Wyoming,
Montana and Texas.
   Wildlife groups say the coyote is unfairly maligned. Attacking a
sheep is a learned skill, and not all coyotes kill livestock. Most
avoid humans. They also keep mice populations in check.
   ``Coyotes are opportunistic. They're not evil,'' says Susan
Hagood of Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington-based group with
80,000 members nationwide. She says coyotes can be discouraged by
guard dogs, electric fences, placing ewes in sheds when they lamb
and selective shooting or trapping of sheep killers.
   ``It would be a waste of time, effort and money to try to
eliminate them. The government spent millions of dollars and failed
to eradicate the coyote. We would hate to see Eastern states
adopting Western philosophies and making the same mistakes,'' Ms.
Hagood says.
   Some states have studied the impact of coyotes on deer
populations. In Maine, selective trapping eliminates troublesome
coyotes, but the animals are not significantly damaging the deer
herd.
   ``As far as I know, the coyote has not had any serious
repercussions on native wildlife. It does not appear to be a
disaster. If it is causing people problems, people have themselves
to blame,'' says Ronald Novak of the U.S. Department of Interior.
   In Pennsylvania, where coyotes can be hunted or trapped
year-round, they number an estimated 2,000 to 3,000.
   Says Arnold Hayden, a coyote expert with the Pennsylvania Game
Commission, ``They're probably everywhere but downtown Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The man who created gospel music is as obscure
as his music is popular. Thomas Dorsey is now 88 and bedridden in
his Chicago home. A handful of gospel devotees are working to build
a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half a century ago, Thomas Dorsey
crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of
his youth to create a foot-stomping, soul-slapping sound that still
fills black churches.
   A personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and
love of the bawdy, bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the
young jazz pianist to create what he called ``gospel'' music.
   Now 88, bedridden in his Chicago home and suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, Dorsey is in danger of dying in obscurity, his
legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music
but don't know his name.
   ``He was the person who gave blacks a medium to keep their
tradition alive,'' says Michael Harris, a professor of religion and
African American studies at Temple University in Philadelphia and
the author of a new biography on Dorsey.
   Black church music before Dorsey ``was very easygoing. It wasn't
upbeat, it wasn't filled with a lot of rhythmic tones,'' says Bob
Storman, a former gospel performer who with a handful of other
aficionados is working to build a Dorsey foundation in Chicago.
   ``It wasn't until the late '20s and '30s that a lot of ministers
would let that kind of music into their church,'' Storman says.
``The ministers figured that it was indecent and unreligious. For
them it was like some people react to acid rock music today.''
   Dorsey's song ``It's Tight Like That'' hit the top of the blues
charts about September 1928, Harris says. ``A number of people were
very shocked to see the type of music they danced to the night
before the next morning in church,'' he says.
   Dorsey's all-time greatest hit, ``Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''
was the favorite song of the Rev. Martin Luther King, and was
popularized by the late Mahalia Jackson, who once toured with
Dorsey. It has been translated into more than 50 languages.
   Dorsey's work includes more than 1,000 gospel tunes and all
would be displayed, his wife, Kathryn, said in an interview from
the couple's South Side home.
   ``I think he would think it was one of the greatest things that
ever happened,'' she said. ``It would be the only one in the United
States'' dedicated solely to Dorsey, she said.
   But efforts to raise a half-million dollars for the foundation
have faltered. A Chicago concert in December was to be the group's
first fund-raising event, but it was canceled for lack of interest.
   Storman says that while people know Dorsey's music, they don't
know Dorsey. They confuse him with Tommy Dorsey, the jazz
bandleader of the 1940s.
   In promoting Thomas Dorsey, Storman and colleagues have found
that ``people thought we were talking about the jazz artist. We had
to remind people that Tommy Dorsey had passed.'' Tommy Dorsey died
in 1956.
   Thomas Dorsey was born July 1, 1899, just outside Atlanta. His
father was sickly, and he, his mother and four siblings had to help
support the family.
   ``His mother was a very, very religious woman who had been a
profound influence on him,'' says Harris.
   ``He became enamored of a resident pianist at a local theater.
Then as a 12-year-old boy he started playing in bordellos, playing
piano, blues. By that time, he was supporting his family.''
   Dorsey later began composing blues and playing jazz and blues
piano. He adopted the stage name ``Georgia Tom.''
   He began experimenting with gospel music as a way to reconcile
an internal conflict over his religious upbringing and his early
love of blues, Harris says.
   As a young man, Dorsey moved to Chicago, and gradually began to
concentrate on composing gospel music.
   ``He was the first black man in America to publish gospel music,
in 1926,'' and started his own publishing firm at that time in
Chicago, Storman says.
   He sent his first two gospel songs, ``If You See My Saviour''
and ``How About You,'' to hundreds of churches. ``Not a single
person ordered one,'' Harris says.
   ``He spent time going from church to church trying to sell this.
The people thought it was blues, an inappropriate kind of music for
formal worship.''
   In 1931, Dorsey was devastated by the deaths of his first wife
and baby daughter in childbirth. ``That was when he wrote his
all-time great, `Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''' Storman says.
``And that was when he became totally dedicated to just doing
gospel.''
   In January 1932, at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Chicago, the Rev.
J. Howard Lorenzo Smith hired Dorsey to form a choir.
   A month later, at Pilgrim Baptist Church, the Rev. J.C. Austin
invited Smith to preach an anniversary service, Harris says. Smith
brought the choir and ``staid Pilgrim Baptist Church ... went
wild.''
   Two days later Austin offered Dorsey the job of directing his
church chorus.
   ``I was a little boy then,'' says the Rev. J.C. Austin Jr.,
Austin's son and the current minister. ``You couldn't get into the
church. The fire department came to keep the traffic moving ...
every Sunday morning.''
   Under Dorsey, the choir gained national attention, and he
remained its director until the late 1970s, when he retired.
   Dorsey, a tall, thin, distinguished-looking man, was shrewd in
his business dealings.
   ``He was self-taught, never went beyond third grade. But he took
this gospel thing and built his own publishing business out of
it,'' Harris says.
   Dorsey sold his business in the early 1950s to New York-based
Chapel Music, which has continued to publish his music, his
attorney Jay Ross says.
   Dorsey also knew how to create music that performers want to
sing.
   ``There's no comparison to him. He's in a class all by
himself,'' says gospel singer Albertina Walker.
   ``The songs that he wrote ... they have such a meaning, they
have such a message. People are forgetting Dorsey. But you really
can't forget him. He should be remembered as the father of gospel
music, the founder of gospel music.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Yellow River, has been largely tamed by the
Chinese government's relentless dike- and reservoir-building
efforts. But many still remember the day 50 years ago when a
ruptured dike sent the waters cascading over village rooftops,
killing 890,000 and leaving millions homeless.

<TEXT>
   Shi Xiaoshan was just 5 years old when
Chinese Nationalists broke the dike on the Yellow River 50 years
ago in a vain attempt to stop advancing Japanese troops. Shi took
refuge in a large floating pot.
   ``The water was over the roofs in some villages,'' Shi recalls
of the 1938 calamity that claimed an estimated 890,000 lives and
left millions homeless and without food. Shi's family had to beg to
survive.
   Today, the retired worker lives quietly a short stroll away from
that once-ruptured dike, confident neither man nor nature will ever
again unleash the river known as ``China's Sorrow.''
   The 3,388-mile Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization
and the bane of its existence, has been largely tamed by relentless
dike- and reservoir-building efforts of the Communist government
since it took power in 1949.
   But there remains an undercurrent of threat to the 110 million
people who live along the banks of the world's muddiest river.
   ``Nature does not change easily,'' says Chen Xiande, deputy
director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission based in
Zhengzhou, the capital of central China's Henan province.
   The river begins in the remote plateaus of western Qinghai
province and winds through nine provinces before reaching Bohai Bay
in Shandong province. Over the past 2,000 years, it has flooded
some 1,500 times. It has changed course 26 times in recorded
history, about once every century, each time disrupting the lives
of millions.
   In 1887, when the river tore through its banks in Henan, 11
large cities were inundated and a 50,000-square-mile area was under
water for two months. Hundreds of thousands _ perhaps millions _
died.
   There has been no major flood since 1946, largely because of a
dike-building program comparable to the excavation of two Panama
canals. Chen says his 29,000-member commission has overseen the
construction of seven of the 30 reservoirs that are planned to help
control the river while supplying electrical power and irrigation
to the barren riverside plains.
   But he says his engineers have still made only small gains in
controlling the flow of sandy yellowish sediment that gives the
river its name and its unique power to destroy.
   As the river courses southward from Inner Mongolia through the
chalky and erosion-pocked loess plateau of China's midsection, it
deposits 1.6 billion tons of silt in its middle and lower reaches.
   Every year the riverbed in the lower reaches rises another 4
inches, creating what is called a ``suspended river'' where the
water level is 13 to 23 feet above the surrounding land.
   Since 1949 the dikes have been heightened and reinforced three
times to contain the rising waters. The huge Sanmenxia dam in
western Henan had to be rebuilt almost immediately after it was
completed in the 1960s because engineers were fooled by the
onslaught of silt.
   The Yellow's powers of deception can be seen from atop the
500-year-old dikes north of Zhengzhou breached by Chiang Kai-shek's
troops in 1938 and repaired in 1947.
   The river channel is 6 miles wide, but in the dry winter months
the water is only several hundred yards across, a faint glimmer far
out over the frozen mud flats packed with silt from the loess
plains of Shaanxi province 600 miles to the northwest.
   Yet in the summer rainy season the entire channel is filled, and
after hard rain the waters pound against the 16-foot high concrete
embankments.
   A new, computerized warning system, built with U.S. and United
Nations assistance, gives engineers 20 hours' notice of a potential
flood, says Yellow River Conservancy Commission Senior Engineer Niu
Zengqi. That's time enough to open sluices and fill water-retention
reservoirs. In the distant past, news of impending floods came via
horseback.
   Niu says the government has spent $1.3 billion since 1949 to
harness the river, and is now planning a new dam at Xiaolangdi,
eastern Henan, that should reduce sediment buildup by 40 percent
over 50 years.
   There are other, more visionary plans, such as changing the
course of the river _ largely discounted as too expensive and
disruptive _ and linking the sluggish Yellow with its slightly
longer sister to the south, the Yangtze.
   The idea is that the Yangtze, which carries far much more water
than the Yellow, would help flush out the sediment on the Yellow's
riverbed.
   But Deputy Director Chen stresses that ``most important is
solving the sediment problem by soil conservation in the loess
region. Without vegetation, the problem of silt will only get
worse.''
   China has used the waters of the river to irrigate more than 10
million acres, five times the amount of irrigated land in 1949.
   But tree-plantings and other anti-erosion campaigns still cover
only about one-fourth of the 172,000 square miles of loess plateau
that loses its fragile topsoil to the river.
   Engineer Niu says he's sure deaths could be avoided if the
waters rose to desperately high levels in the future. But up to 1
million people might have to be moved and $270 million in damages
could be sustained if water has to be released into emergency
retention areas.
   Along the river near Zhengzhou, where the soil was once too
alkaline to produce anything but salt, irrigation has made the rice
paddies the most productive in Henan.
   ``I remember how afraid the peasants were when work began in
1955 to open the dike for the irrigation gate,'' says local
resident Shi. ``They thought Chairman Mao was breaking the dikes
just as Chiang Kai-shek before him.''
   ``Now I don't hate the river,'' says 70-year-old farmer Cui
Xingxian, who stood on the wall as the Nationalist troops destroyed
it. ``In the past I feared the river, but now I love it.''

   It was 10 years ago that we first met the
Ewing family, those oil barons of the Southfork Ranch and CBS'
``Dallas.''
   How times have changed _ and how ``Dallas'' has changed.
   Few people today remember that the original star of ``Dallas''
was Pamela Barnes Ewing, played by Victoria Principal, and that her
marriage to Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) would give the show its
theme of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' The feuding Barneses and the Ewings
would be the show's Montagues and Capulets. It also had a dash of
``Giant'' and ``Peyton Place'' tossed in.
   It was even considered, but only briefly, that Bobby would be
killed in the fifth episode and it would be Pam vs. the family.
   J.R. Ewing, played by Larry Hagman, was a supporting character,
and his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was such a minor character
she didn't even speak in the first show on April 2, 1978. The
script referred to her only as the ``brunette on the couch'' and
didn't even identify her as J.R.'s wife.
   Still, Hagman emerged with the meatiest role in the first show
and he made the most of it. ``He is deliciously wicked as he
attempts to eject Principal from the family bosom by any foul
means,'' a pre-debut story said.
   Writer David Jacobs created the show with Pamela as the focus.
``This is a poor girl who marries into a rich family _ and her own
family's enemy,'' Jacobs said in a 1978 interview.
   ``Dallas'' was actually a spinoff of ``Knots Landing,'' although
``Dallas'' got on the air first. The Dallas locale was picked
because CBS and Lorimar Productions wanted to get away from the
usual Los Angeles background.
   ``It all seems like yesterday and a hundred years ago,'' says
Leonard Katzman, the current executive producer. He has been with
the show since the beginning except for the season when both he and
Patrick Duffy left the show. He calls it ``the season that didn't
exist'' because it was all passed off as Pamela's dream when Duffy
returned.
   He says there is some talk of putting together a retrospective
of the show's 10 years during the summer for a special.
   ``We came on in the spring with five shows,'' he recalls. ``As
far as we knew that's all we were going to do. Then CBS picked us
up for seven more shows. Then enough shows to complete the first
full season. We had a cliffhanger that year, but nobody remembers
it.''
   Few remember the first cliffhanger, in which Sue Ellen wrecked
her car and you didn't know if she and her unborn baby would
survive.
   The second cliffhanger, in 1980, caused a phenomenon around the
world that was unprecedented in the history of television. ``Who
Shot J.R.?'' was on the lips of millions upon millions of people,
from Seattle to New York to London to Paris.
   By the time it was revealed that Kristin had pulled the trigger,
``Dallas'' had climbed to No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings. It reigned
over the ratings for the next four years, slipping once to second
place, until NBC overtook CBS as the first-place network and ``The
Cosby Show'' put the sitcoms back at the top of the ratings.
   A less well-known event of the summer of 1980 occurred when
Hagman asked Lorimar to raise his salary to $100,000 an episode.
Lorimar not only refused but told Hagman that J.R. could wake up in
the hospital after plastic surgery and be Robert Culp.
   Hagman got the last laugh, however. Katzman says he is by far
the highest paid performer on television today. ``And several other
people on `Dallas' are not too far behind,'' he says.
   ``Dallas'' captured the interest of the audience, Katzman
believes, because there had never been a family like this on
television before.
   ``They were very wealthy, but they had no airs,'' he says. ``Jim
Davis was plain folks. They fought with each other, then made up.
Plus, we showed that you can't equate money with happiness.''
   ``Dallas'' did not become a serial until its first full season.
   ``Sue Ellen became pregnant and no one knew whether the father
was J.R. or Cliff Barnes,'' says Katzman. ``We carried that story
for quite a while. It caught on with the audience. So we began
doing more stories that ran from week to week.
   ``We also found ourselves with the greatest character in
television, J.R. Ewing. It's hard to say when he began to emerge,
but it was probably the end of the fifth show when Pam lost her
baby. J.R. and Pam had a fight in a hayloft and she fell and lost
the baby. At first he seemed contrite, then you began to see how
wicked he could be.''
   Jim Davis, who played Jock, the patriarch of the Ewings, died in
1981.
   ``Jim represented something we've never been able to
recapture,'' says Katzman. ``As bad as the boys could be, if he
walked into a room and told them to knock it off they did. I think
the audience responded to that strong head of the family and the
warm woman (Barbara Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie) at the other end of
the table.
   ``Much of J.R.'s motivation was looking good in his father's
eyes. When Jim died that motivation disappeared. So we had to
transfer it to his son. After that, when he did something terrible
it was to build the empire for his son, as his father had done for
him.''
   Others have left the series and returned. Donna Reed replaced
Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie when she had heart surgery. Charlene
Tilton, who plays Lucy Ewing Cooper, left the show but returned
this season. Patrick Duffy quit in 1985, but returned after missing
one season _ the famous season that disappeared as Pam's dream. Pam
herself is now gone with the departure of Victoria Principal.
   Every departure shifted relationships. Without Bobby, J.R. had
no one to hold him in check. Pamela's departure separates her
brother, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) from the Ewings.
   Is ``Dallas'' a soap opera or a spoof?
   ``We play it straight, although we sometimes take it to
extremes,'' Katzman says. ``We've never taken ourselves as
seriously as some other shows. `Knots Landing' is the most
reality-based show. We have our own reality, but it's a fictitious
reality.''
   Next season, CBS and Lorimar are considering a move away from
the serial format. Either every story would begin and end within an
episode, or in the manner of ``L.A. Law'' and ``St. Elsewhere,''
some storylines would be resolved and some would carry over a few
weeks.
   ``This show will last as long as the actors want to keep on
doing it,'' says Katzman.

   Hicks' job doesn't end when the curtain goes up. During the
performance, she's in the dressing room or the wings, ready to do
minor touch-ups.
   As for Crawford, the makeup is with him for 12 hours on
Wednesdays and Saturdays, when he performs twice; seven hours on
the four days when he does just one show.
   At the end of the show, Hicks applies vast amounts of mineral
oil to remove the makeup, which is peeled off gently so as not to
irritate the skin.
   ``There aren't many makeup jobs in theater because nowadays
actors learn to do their own makeup,'' says Hicks, who grew up in
Surrey and moved to Oxford before going to London to study at
Complexions, the London School of Makeup.
   Hicks met Tucker, the makeup designer, when he spoke at the
school. He hired her to work on ``Phantom.'' It was her first job.
   ``It was quite an extensive training period he put her
through,'' Crawford says. ``I remember him throwing all her brushes
from college out the door and saying `What's this, girl? You can't
use this, girl.' It was something out of Dickens, and I had to sit
there absolutely quiet. But it worked.''
   Hicks adapted quickly to her on-the-job training.
   ``We had done a lot of this in theory at school, but in practice
I had never done it although I always wanted to get into prosthetic
makeup,'' she says.
   The makeup design for ``Phantom'' was first discussed during the
summer of 1986, several months before the show opened in London at
Her Majesty's Theater. Tucker, scenic designer Maria Bjornson and
Crawford experimented with many different kinds of makeup. They
found they were limited by practical considerations.
   ``There were restrictions _ not being able to cover the nose
because of breathing or going inside the mouth too far because of
the singing or covering the ears because it would interfere with
listening to the music,'' Crawford says.
   What the three of them came up with is what Hicks tries to
recapture at every performance.
   ``It's interesting. People say `How can you do the same show
every day when you're an actor?''' Crawford says. ``It's exactly
the same thing with the makeup. It's like painting. Every day is a
challenge to paint that picture.''

<TEXT>
   Little noticed by the rest of the world, a
guerrilla war in Mozambique has created a new and serious refugee
problem in Africa, along with its toll in human life and economic
loss since it began in 1977. But it also is having a deep impact on
Mozambique's black-governed neighbors in southern Africa and holds
the seeds of an even wider regional conflict, swallowing people
already struggling with poverty and drought. Mozambique, Africa's
poorest nation, is on the Indian Ocean and provides its black
neighbors their only trading outlet, except for nearby South
Africa. But the neighbors' efforts to cut their dependence on South
Africa for trade routes by using a corridor through Mozambique have
been disrupted by the guerrilla conflict. ``The survival of
Mozambique is our survival,'' Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe says. ``The fall of Mozambique certainly also will be our
fall.''
   Here are reports by Associated Press correspondents on how the
war is affecting two of Mozambique's closest neighbors.

   In the gnarled branches of ancient
baobab trees hundreds of pelicans from Mozambique peacefully nest,
giving rise to a local joke that even the birds have fled the civil
war next door.
   During one of the incessant deluges that turn the rich farmland
into marshes this time of year, Manuel Thomo and his family, human
refugees from the war in Mozambique, huddled around a camp fire
beneath the branches of another baobab tree, a temporary home for
them and several other families.
   Rag-clad and diseased, hungry and frightened, more than 400,000
Mozambicans have crossed into neighboring Malawi in the past 17
months to escape fighting at home between guerrillas and the
government.
   The refugees have abandoned the poorest country in southern
Africa for refuge in the region's second poorest nation.
   ``This is the major refugee problem in Africa south of the
Sahara, excluding Sudan and Somalia,'' said Raymond Mkanda, a
Tanzanian who heads the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
operation in Malawi.
   ``The pressure on the land is pretty heavy. Malawi doesn't have
adequate land for its own people and the refugees are occupying
land normally used for farming.''
   For generations, Mozambicans have been welcomed visitors across
the 1,000 miles of unguarded border they share with the Malawians.
   But fighting between government troops and the rebel Mozambique
National Resistance, more commonly known by the Portuguese acronym
RENAMO, have sent waves of Mozambicans fleeing into Malawi.
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and has a
government based on Marxist theory.
   The refugees have put a strain on Malawian resources and caused
security problems.
   Drought last year has forced Malawi, once one of the Africa's
few food exporters, to look elsewhere for food to feed its own
people.
   Increasingly, men suspected of being RENAMO fighters have
crossed into Malawi to steal livestock and relief rations from the
refugees. A cattle stealing raid in January ended with the deaths
of three Malawian villagers who resisted the raiders, officials
said. They were the first Malawian casualties of the cross-border
intrusions, which also have cost the lives of several Mozambican
refugees.
   Landlocked Malawi is one of Africa's smallest and most densely
populated countries _ nearly 8 million people in the country about
the size of Pennsylvania.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees estimates the number of
Mozambican refugees in Malawi will reach a 500,000 by the end of
the year.
   ``Half a million refugees in a small country like Malawi is a
very big problem,'' said S.S. Kamvazina, principal secretary in the
Ministry of Health and the chairman of the joint committee
responsible for the refugees' care.
   An estimated 330,000 more Mozambican war refugees are in nearby
Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, according
to the UNHCR.
   Most of the refugees arrive with similar stories of abuse from
both sides in the Mozambican conflict.
   Government troops accuse civilians of collaborating with the
rebels and take reprisals. RENAMO fighters, in turn, frequently
force villagers to carry supplies on long marches. The civilians
who falter or weaken are beaten or killed, some of the refugees
have charged.
   ``Some of the refugees take weeks wandering through the
countryside to avoid fighting,'' Mkanda said.
   For others, it's a short walk across an asphalt ribbon known as
M1, Malawi's major north-south road connecting the capital,
Lilongwe, with Blantyre, the country's largest town.
   For 60 miles, M1 serves as the border between Malawi and
Mozambique.
   Lush fields of maize (corn) and other crops crowd both sides of
the road.
   But while mud huts dot the landscape on the Malawian side,
abandoned buildings and deserted huts line the Mozambican side.
   The former owners have fled, taking tin from the roofs and
windows from the buildings to use in build new homes on the Malawi
side of the road.
   During the day, some Mozambicans venture across the road to work
their old fields, but never too far inland to risk running into a
rebel or government patrol.
   Mozambicans living along M1 were among the first to flee the
fighting. That first mass movement, in September 1986, brought
40,000 refugees to Malawi. Three months later, the number had
nearly doubled and by March 1987 it reached 100,000.
   Over the next 12 months the refugee population quadrupled.
   ``It's very difficult for the government to cope with the
problem,'' said Kamvanzina, the Health Ministry official. ``We get
no notice that tomorrow so many people are coming in.''
   More than 168,000 Mozambicans have settled here in the
southernmost district of Nsanje, the largest refugee concentration.
Refugees now outnumber the local population and the surrounding
mountainsides are being denuded by the newcomers who fell trees for
firewood and huts.
   Because of the influx _ as many as 100 a day _ it takes up to 10
days for officials to build even temporary shelter for the new
arrivals. Many of the refugees in the teeming camp near Mangkokwe
wear clothing fashioned from burlap sacks that once held their
rations.
   ``Those who are coming in now are in terrible condition _
malnutrition, no clothes, tuberculosis,'' said District
Commissioner Geoff Mwanja, the chief government officer for Nsanje.
``War has reduced human beings to beasts. If there was a way of
ending this thing, it would be very, very nice.''
   The U.N. refugee commission has budgeted $13 million for Malawi
in 1988 _ a ``seriously conservative figure,'' Mkanda said.
   International aid has started to pour in, including $1.2 million
from the U.S. Agency for Internationnal Development.
   ``Repatriation is the most durable solution,'' Mkanda said.
   Nobody expects that soon.
   ``They might be here for some time _ five years, 10 years,''
Mkanda said. ``Even if there is change tomorrow in Mozambique, that
doesn't mean that everybody will leave.''

   A decade ago, thousands of guerrillas
flooded across the border from Mozambique to mount a final assault
against the white-minority government in what then was call
Rhodesia.
   Today, eight years after Rhodesia became black-governed
Zimbabwe, battalions of troops, including guerrilla veterans of
that independence war, are strung along the same border _ this time
to block a new wave of incursions by guerrillas fighting to
overthrow Mozambique's government.
   The outcome of the guerrillas' strikes in Mozambique and inside
Zimbabwe will have a major impact on the fragile economies of the
troubled region in southern Africa.
   Several black-ruled states are striving to divert their trade
traffic from South Africa to Indian Ocean ports in Mozambique, a
former Portuguese colony, in a bid to loosen their economic
dependency on the South Africans.
   The rebels, in turn, vow to continue sabotaging Mozambique's
supply lines that also serve Malawi, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   So far, the 12,000 to 20,000 guerrillas of the anti-government
Mozambique National Resistance seem unharried by the conventional
forces ranged against them in Mozambique and Zimbabwe _ some 30,000
Mozambican regulars, more than 12,000 Zimbabweans, 2,000 Tanzanians
and a few hundred Malawians.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves nationalists opposing a
Marxist-based government, roam Mozambique's 10 provinces and mount
frequent raids into Zimbabwe with virtual impunity.
   ``It's very strange being on the other side,'' said a young
Zimbabwean corporal who fought the Rhodesians under the name
Comrade Hammer.
   ``We know from our experience it's hard to beat guerrillas. But
these people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how they
think and what they might do next.''
   The guerrillas, known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO,
originally were formed by the Rhodesian intelligence service in
1977, two years after Mozambique's independence from Portugal, to
harass nationalist guerrillas directed by Robert Mugabe from inside
Mozambique during Zimbabwe's 1973-79 independence war.
   Mugabe became Zimbabwe's prime minister at independence from
Britain in April 1980 and cut support to the Mozambican rebels. But
South Africa took over the reins until 1984 when it signed a
non-aggression pact with Mozambique. Since then, Mozambique claims
South African support has continued, a charge denied by the South
African government.
   The Mozambican rebels declared war on Zimbabwe last year after
Mugabe vowed that a quarter of his forces stationed in Mozambique
would fight to keep its government in power.
   Since then they have stepped up raids along the 750-mile
frontier of forested mountains and scrub-dotted plains.
   Rebels have killed scores of villagers and some security-force
militias. They have abducted hundreds of civilians, including
children, and marched them at gunpoint into Mozambique, apparently
as dragooned recruits.
   They also have destroyed government schools, clinics and
development projects; robbed country stores and remote homesteads
of food, drink and clothing; ambushed buses and looted passengers;
ordered workers to leave forestry estates, coffee plantations and
orchards; rustled cattle, sheep and goats.
   Mugabe has exhorted his troops ``to erect an impassable defense
along our border'' to prevent fresh incursions.
   He also urged them to renew military efforts inside Mozambique
``to completely deny the enemy any ... chance to sabotage our
arteries to the sea.''
   Lt. Col. Solomon Mujuru, a wartime guerrilla chieftain and now
Zimbabwe's army commander, called on civilians living along the
frontier to report people they suspect might have links to the
guerrillas.
   But Mujuru said Zimbabwean troops had gained the upper hand in
counterinsurgency operations since the first major incursions eight
months ago.
   Before June, Mujuru's soldiers and the rebels clashed only in
Mozambique.
   Since then, troops of Zimbabwe's new 5,000-member 6th Brigade
have reinforced border defenses, militias are guarding farms,
villages, schools and clinics and cross-border movement has been
banned except at established immigration posts.
   Anti-personnel mines have been sown where guerrillas are thought
to cross into Zimbabwqe and the identification papers of some
65,000 Mozambican refugees in three camps are being screened by
local authorities and the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees.
   In addition, courts have cracked down on local peasants
suspected of links to the insurgents. Early in February, a Mutare
judge sent a woman to prison for six years and a man for five years
for failing to report the presence of bandits to officials.
   At stake in the conflict is not only the survival of Mozambique,
its economy already in ruins as a result of fighting and famine.
   Also at issue is the fate of the so-called Beira Corridor, a
186-mile trade route that meanders through mountains, fertile
valleys and swamps from the Zimbabwean border city to the Indian
Ocean port of Beira in Mozambique.
   A fifth of the overseas trade of the black-ruled neighbor states
flows along the corridor's railroads and highways. Landlocked
Zimbabwe receives most of its fuel suppliers from a corridor
pipeline despite repeated sabotage by the guerrillas. Most of that
trade and oil previously went through South Africa.
   Both Mugabe and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique have
rejected suggestions that they hold peace talks with the
guerrillas, arguing that the rebels are puppets of South Africa's
government and have no support from either the East or the West.
   Mugabe, at the graduation ceremony for the 6th Brigade in
September, said he was forced to form the unit because of what he
called South African destabilization in the region.
   ``South Africa's subversion of Mozambique's ... sovereignity had
the potential to completely deny us any routes to the sea,'' Mugabe
said.
   ``The survival of Mozambique is our survival,'' Mugabe said.
``The fall of Mozambique certainly also will be our fall.''

<HEAD>India Building Navy in its `Zone of Peace'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation that wants to turn the Indian
Ocean into a ``zone of peace'' has just acquired a nuclear
submarine to add to its two aircraft carriers and 110 other naval
vessels.
   India's acquisition last month of the nuclear submarine from the
Soviet Union is part of a naval expansion since failing in its
efforts of almost 20 years to clear the Indian Ocean of big-power
navies.
   The expansion has aroused criticism from neighboring Pakistan
and the United States, which has warships in the ocean along with
the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   Within the past two years, India also has acquired five
conventional submarines, its second aircraft carrier and at least
five Indian-built navy ships.
   It has plans to buy more _ including possibly other Soviet
nuclear subs _ and to build warships ranging from submarines to
another aircraft carrier for its fleet.
   ``It's the full range of naval warfare. They're building a
first-class navy,'' a Western naval analyst said.
   When the 47,000-member Indian navy got the carrier Hermes from
Britain last year and renamed it Viraat (Imposing), the chief of
naval staff at the time, Adm. R.H. Tahiliani, said: ``We finally
have a round-the-clock blue (deep) water navy.''
   While greater naval strength seems to belie India's pleas before
the United Nations for a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean, it
matches the country's growing might.
   India also has a 1-million-man army, the world's fourth largest,
and is acquiring modern weapons.
   Each step up, however, is ascribed to the need to match the
growing arsenals of others, chiefly neighboring rivals Pakistan and
China but also the Western powers.
   ``The strategies of outside powers in our region have forced
upon us expenditure in building military strength which we would
much rather have deployed for the removal of poverty,'' Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi said as the nuclear sub Chakra was
commissioned.
   ``The Indian Ocean has been militarized and infested with
nuclear weapons flouting the overwhelming sentiment within the
region in favor of establishing a zone of peace.''
   India first proposed a zone of peace for the Indian Ocean in the
early 1970s, and the Non-Aligned Movement (Third World) endorsed
the concept. The proposal then went to the U.N. General Assembly,
which in 1971 adopted a declaration calling for a peace zone and
urging the dismantling of big powers' air and naval bases in the
Indian Ocean. But a planned U.N. conference on the issue has never
been held, although a committee has been meeting in hopes of
bringing one about by 1990.
   The Soviet Union has endorsed the idea, but the United States
has not.
   India's naval buildup initially was attributed to the
development of a U.S. Navy base in the early 1980s at Diego Garcia,
an island in the Chagos Archipelago about 1,000 miles southwest of
India.
   An Indian naval expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he did not believe his nation faces a real threat from U.S. or
other Western ships protecting oil shipping in the Persian Gulf,
but he added: ``If you have troubled waters close to home, you
think about what you might have to do.''
   He said India believed more sea power was needed to protect its
4,937 miles of coastline and to keep a competitive edge in naval
technology.
   Of the newly acquired nuclear sub, he said: ``It's a system
without which a navy is not viable. It takes the game to a new step
altogether.''
   Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo of Pakistan has condemned
the acquisition of the sub as an escalation of the military buildup
in the region. Press reports say Pakistan, with no nuclear
submarine, is pressing the United States for P-3 anti-submarine
aircraft.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman has said India's
acquisition of a nuclear sub ``clearly introduces a new weapons
technology into the South Asian region.''
   The United States is opposed to India having a nuclear submarine
because of a lack of safeguards, Redman added.
   Neither India nor Pakistan has signed the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974,
and Pakistan is thought to be on the verge of developing nuclear
weapons. Both nations say their nuclear plans are peaceful in
design.
   The new Chakra submarine, for the moment leased by the Soviets
to the Indian navy, is not believed to carry nuclear weapons.
   The Western naval analyst, who insisted his name not be used,
said the Charlie I class sub is ``1960s technology. It's an old
boat.''
   India's second aircraft carrier, the Viraat, was originally
commissioned in 1959, and the Western expert noted that India
``does not have enough planes for one carrier, let alone two.''
   India, however, is buying British Sea Harrier aircraft and Sea
King commando helicopters for its carriers.
   It also has bought three late-1970s vintage Kilo class Soviet
submarines and two West German HDW 209s, called ``search and kill
subs,'' to update its fleet of eight Soviet-made Foxtrot subs.
   In addition, India is upgrading its three shipyards to build
warships and constructing its largest naval base near Karwar, 285
miles south of Bombay on the west coast.
   There are reports the navy is expanding an existing base on its
far-flung Nicobar islands, 1,035 miles from the country's southern
tip but only about 100 miles from Indonesia.
   The Indian naval expert saw these developments in light of
India's need to protect itself.
   ``You need military power for your own security, not that you
have expansionist ambitions,'' he said.
   His Western counterpart said India's rationale for an expanding
navy was its view of itself as the regional power of South Asia.
   Indian navy men also see themselves as heirs to British sea
power from the days when Britain controlled the Indian Ocean to
protects its trade routes to Asia, the Western analyst said.
   ``They want a navy they can operate throughout the Indian
Ocean,'' he said. ``The Brits were there before. They want to be
there too.''

   Wednesday is the 20th anniversary of the
massacre of civilians by U.S. troops at the Vietnamese village of
My Lai. The writer, who covered the Vietnam War as an Associated
Press correspondent for 10 years and was the AP's last Saigon
bureau chief, returned to Southeast Asia a decade after the war
ended and visited My Lai in December 1984.

   At 7:22 on a Saturday morning 20 years ago, Charlie Company
lifted off in helicopters with rifles on their arms and revenge in
their hearts. The infantrymen were on a mission to My Lai that
would become synonymous with shame and cover-up.
   Two minutes after they were airborne on that day, March 16,
1968, U.S. artillery guns firing in support from Landing Zone
Uptight indiscriminately shelled the village. Helicopter gunships
raked the landing zone with rockets and machine gun fire.
   The thundering artillery, the whistling rockets and the steady
clatter of machine guns sent villagers who had been working in the
rice paddies diving for cover along the dikes and in the buffalo
pits in the fields. Others, like Pham Thi Trinh, then a 10-year-old
schoolgirl, and her family, took refuge in homemade shelters in
front of their huts.
   As the troop-carrying helicopters from Task Force Barker made
their final approach, smoke from fires touched off by the artillery
poured into the skies. At 7:30, the first troops landed, aroused
about a grudge operation aimed at evening the score for the
American casualties suffered from mines, booby traps and snipers.
   ``The attitude of all the men, the majority, I would say, was a
revengeful attitude,'' said Gregory Olson in testimony at a
military inquiry into the My Lai assault. ``They all felt a little
bad because (we) lost a number of buddies to May Lai.''
   ``People were talking about killing everything that moved,''
recalled another participant, Robert Pendleton. ``Everyone knew
what we were going to do.''
   They had been briefed the day before on their target: the 48th
Viet Cong local force battalion, perhaps as many as 250 troops that
intelligence said posed a threat to the provincial capital of Quang
Ngai City 6 miles away. Their mission: to destroy their supply base
and staging area.
   ``When we left the briefing, we felt we were going to have a lot
of resistance and we knew we were supposed to kill everyone in the
village,'' recalled William Lloyd.
   Capt. Ernest L. Medina, the commander of Charlie Company, told
his troops the civilians would be on their way to the local
marketplaces in Quang Ngai City by 7 a.m. But that was not the case.
   Charlie Company's 1st Platoon, led by Lt. William L. Calley,
Jr., moved into My Lai firing at fleeing Vietnamese, throwing
grenades into houses and bunkers, and slaughtering animals.
   ``We heard the sound of American soldiers,'' Pham Thi Trinh told
a reporter years later. ``People hiding in the shelter got out as
they usually did when Americans entered the village.'' The U.S.
troops ordered her family and four neighbors to the front of the
house, she said. She hid in a bedroom.
   ``They shot to death three cows first,'' she said. ``Then they
knelt and shot my family. People tried to run away. My parents, six
brothers and sisters, grandmother and aunt and uncle were killed.''
   After shooting her mother, she said, the Americans placed straw
on the woman and lighted it. She said that when her 14-year-old
sister ran from the burning kitchen of their home, laughing
soldiers forced her back into the fire. Pham Thi Trinh ran to her
76-year-old grandmother's house and found her body partly inside a
clothes cupboard where she had tried to hide.
   Vo Thi Lien, then 11, was in a shelter with her grandparents.
   ``I saw three American soldiers point guns and shoot into the
shelter and then throw grenades into it and hit my grandmother,''
she said. Numbed and unable to find a way out of the collapsing
shelter, she and her grandfather finally were rescued by some
villagers.
   By the time Charlie Company left My Lai in the early afternoon,
its troops had killed at least 175-200 Vietnamese men, women and
children, according to the 1970 report of the Army inquiry headed
by the late Lt. Gen. William R. Peers.
   ``The evidence indicates that only three or four were confirmed
as Viet Cong, although there were undoubtedly several unarmed Viet
Cong men, women and children among them and many more active
supporters and sympathizers,'' the Peers Report said.
   Separate estimates by the Criminal Investigation Division of the
Army together with other evidence indicated more than 400 civilians
were killed.
   A plaque in My Lai is inscribed with the names of 504 men, women
and children Vietnamese officials say died in the massacre.
   The only American casualty reported in Charlie Company was a
soldier who was wounded by the discharge of his rifle.
   Members of Calley's platoon testified before the Peers inquiry
that an old man was bayoneted to death and another man was thrown
alive into a well and killed with a hand grenade.
   Of Calley, the central figure of My Lai, the Peers Report said:
``He directed and supervised the men of his platoon in the
systematic killing of many non-combatants in and around My Lai. He
personally participated in the killing of some non-combatants.''
   Of the leader of the 2nd Platoon, Lt. Steven K. Brooks, one of
four officers involved in May Lai who were killed in action in the
following months, the report said: ``He directed and supervised the
men of his platoon in the systematic killing of at least 60 to 70
non-combatants. Although he knew that a number of his men
habitually raped Vietnamese women in villages during operations, on
16 March, 1968, he observed, did not prevent, and failed to report
several rapes by members of his platoon while in My Lai ... and
Binh Tay.''
   Some Vietnamese were spared by the courage of an American
helicopter pilot who threatened to fire on his fellow soldiers if
they harmed a group of 12 to 16 Vietnamese women, children and old
men cowering in a bunker.
   Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson landed his helicopter near the
bunker and ordered his crew to fire on the American infantrymen if
they fired on the Vietnamese while he was trying to get them
evacuated.
   Thompson said he asked a lieutenant to help get the women and
children out, and the infantry officer replied that the only way to
get them out was with a hand grenade. Thompson snapped back at the
lieutenant: ``Just hold your men right where they are and I'll get
the kids out.'' The Vietnamese were safely evacuated.

   The outside world knew nothing of My Lai for more than a year.
The Peers inquiry cited 28 officers ranging from generals to
enlisted men for covering up the massacre.
   On March 29, 1969, Ron Ridenhour, a Vietnam veteran, sent
letters to 30 military and congressional leaders saying he had
heard many reports from soldiers who had served in Charlie Company
that something ``very black'' had happened in My Lai and a public
investigation should be made.
   Eight months later, on Nov. 24, 1969, Calley was ordered
court-martialed on charges of premeditated murder of 109 Vietnamese.
   ``If I have committed a crime,'' Calley said in his defense,
``the only crime that I have committed is in judgment of my values.
Apparently I have valued my troops' lives more than I did that of
the enemy. When my troops were getting massacred and mauled by an
enemy I couldn't see, I couldn't feel and I couldn't touch; that
nobody in the military ever described as anything other than
communism.
   ``They didn't give it a race, they didn't give it a sex, they
didn't give it an age. They never let me believe it was just a
philosophy in a man's mind. That was my enemy out there and when it
came between me and that enemy, I had to value the lives of my
troops, and I feel that is the only crime I have committed.''
   In March 1971, a jury of six senior officers convicted Calley of
first-degree murder of at least 22 villagers, including a boy
fleeing in terror whom Calley tossed into a ditch and shot.
   Calley was ordered to spend life in prison.
   His conviction and sentence touched off a public outcry in his
support including national petition campaigns, angry speeches in
Congress and appeals to President Richard Nixon to pardon him. Five
months later, Nixon reduced his sentence to 20 years.
   Calley actually served three years under house arrest at Fort
Benning, Ga. He was released when his conviction was overturned by
a federal district judge, and he was not returned to house arrest
when the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals reinstated the conviction.
   Calley was the only soldier convicted in the My Lai massacre,
but it became the graveyard for several Army careers.
   Initially, 25 officers and enlisted men were charged, 13 of them
accused of direct involvement in the killing. But only six were
actually tried, including Medina, the company commander.
   The highest ranking officer tried, Col. Oran K. Henderson,
commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade, of which Charlie Company
was a part, was acquitted of charges of failing to conduct an
investigation after he was told civilians had been killed.
   Administrative action was taken against two generals, one of
them demoted and the other censured.
   The Peers Report said no single factor by itself was the cause
of My Lai.
   The battle plan by Lt. Col. Frank A. Barker, commander of the
task force bearing his name, contained inaccurate intelligence on
the strength and whereabouts of the Viet Cong and wrongly assumed
no civilians would be in the area, the report said. It said Barker
and his subordinates failed to make any clear distinction between
soldiers and civilians.
   Barker was killed in a helicopter crash three months later.
   The report said many men in Charlie Company disliked and
mistreated Vietnamese civilians and did not trust them because they
failed to warn the Americans of mines and booby traps, which took a
heavy toll of casualties, frustrating and demoralizing the U.S.
troops.
   Another contributing factor, the report said, was the attitude
of South Vietnamese officials themselves toward the My Lai area,
which they considered Viet Cong-controlled territory and treated as
a free fire zone with little concern about the villagers. This
attitude rubbed off on the Americans, the report said.
   Although atrocities were committed by both sides in the Vietnam
war, My Lai shocked the United States, a nation that took pride in
fighting by the rules of war.
   Today, My Lai is a memorial to its victims. The bodies of the
men, women and children rest in the cemeteries and surrounding
fields.
   In the center of the village is a large statue of a woman
holding a child in her left arm. At her feet are victims of the
massacre.
   My Lai was reborn when the war ended in 1975. Twenty years after
the attack, it is alive again with the scent of flowers in bloom
and the laughter of a new generation of children.

   A score of springs have come and gone for Paul Meadlo since he
left Vietnam. But time has not dulled his memory of My Lai.
   ``I got a permanent reminder,'' said Meadlo in a telephone
interview from his home in Terre Haute, Ind. ``I got my foot blowed
off the very next morning. It must have been God's plan.''
   Meadlo was a 21-year-old rifleman on March 16, 1968, when
Charlie Company swept through the village of My Lai and killed at
least 175-200 men, women and children.
   Granted immunity, he testified at the court-martial of his
platoon leader, Lt. William L. Calley Jr., that he helped Calley
shoot some of them because as far as he was concerned they were
Viet Cong.
   ``It's just something you've got to live with,'' he said. ``It's
rough. Eventually you just got to cross it out of your mind and go
on with your life.''
   Meadlo, now 41, said that when he first left the Army it was
hard to get a job because of the loss of his right foot to a mine.
``I'm still bitter about this forever.''
   He eventually landed a job with a company that makes plastic
film and has been there nearly 20 years. He has a 20-year-old son
and a 19-year-old daughter, both of whom are in the Army.
   Four other men involved in My Lai were killed in action in the
months afterward, including Lt. Col. Frank A. Barker, of New Haven,
Conn., who planned the operation.
   Like Meadlo, My Lai left its imprint on the others who survived
and forever changed their lives.
   For Ernest Medina, the commander of Charlie Company, it meant
the end of an Army career.
   ``I had to resign my commission and get out, setting aside 16{
years service,'' Medina told The Associated Press recently. Even
though he was acquitted in a court-martial, his career was ruined.
   Medina moved with his wife and three children to Marinette,
Wis., in 1971. He worked as a salesman for a helicopter
manufacturer for a time, but for 10 years has been in the real
estate business. His two youngest sons are in the service.
   Now 51, Medina looks back on My Lai as a ``horrendous thing''
that never should have happened.
   ``I have regrets for it but I have no guilt over it because I
didn't cause it,'' he said. ``That's not what the military,
particularly the United States Army, is trained for.
   ``But then again, maybe the war should have never happened,'' he
said. ``I think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, I'm
sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it
otherwise. Maybe it was a war that we should have probably never
gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.''
   Medina said that in looking for the cause of My Lai there is a
need to look at the whole Vietnam War.
   ``It's just totally different,'' he said. ``There were no front
lines. It wasn't a conventional type war. It was a guerrilla war.
It's something I feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot
of the officers were not trained. I'm talking not just about
lieutenants. I'm talking about senior officers ...''
   Another soldier who was court-martialed and acquitted, Charles
Hutto, now lives with his family in Monroe, La., where he works as
a television repairman. Now 39, he was a 19-year-old sergeant at My
Lai.
   Asked the lessons of My Lai, he said, ``Give young boys time to
grow up mentally before you send them to fight a war.''
   Hutto said he has overcome a drinking problem that developed as
he tried ``to cope with what happened in my life during that time
and wondering how come it didn't happen to someone else. I was at
the wrong place at the wrong time.''
   Calley, the central figure in My Lai, declined to talk to a
reporter, maintaining the silence he has kept over the years. Now
44, he works in Columbus, Ga., with his father-in-law, V.V. Vick,
owner of a jewelry store.
   Calley, the only soldier convicted in the case, served three
years under house arrest at Fort Benning, Ga.
   The man who exposed My Lai, Ron Ridenhour, was never there. Now
41, he is an investigative reporter for CityBusiness, a biweekly
newspaper in New Orleans. He recently won a Polk Award for local
reporting for a yearlong investigation of a city tax scandal.
   But 20 years ago, he was a door gunner on an observation
helicopter that flew over the village a few days after the
massacre. It was his conscience that drove him to blow the whistle,
but he waited for several months until he was out of the service
because he feared for his life.
   He learned what had happened at My Lai a month later when he was
transferred to a long-range reconnaissance patrol and was reunited
with half a dozen of his friends from training camp who had been at
the village with Charlie Company. They told him the story.
   In March of 1969, four months after his discharge, he sent
letters to 30 military and congressional leaders detailing what he
had been told.
   ``There's no question I had to turn in my friends,'' he said.
``But it was that or be part of their crime. I believe, though,
that they are also victims that maybe carried the brunt of of what
was really an official policy. I don't regret it. It exposed the
truth. I didn't think people had massacres like My Lai in mind when
they supported the war in Vietnam.''

   After a two-month fight that saw IU
International Corp. repeatedly spurn buyout offers from Neoax Inc.,
the diversified companies have agreed to a merger valued at nearly
$610 million.
   The companies announced Sunday that Neoax had agreed to pay
$22.25 per share for each of IU's 27.4 million common shares
outstanding.
   Neoax, a Stamford, Conn.-based manufacturing concern, had
sweetened its offer on Friday from $22 per share, and the two sides
began negotiating an agreement, the companies said in a joint news
release.
   IU's board of directors, which had recommended its stockholders
ignore Neoax's earlier bids, unanimously endorsed the latest offer.
   IU shares rose 12{ cents to $22 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange. Neoax rose $1.75 to $9.25 a share in national
over-the-counter trading.
   IU, a Wilmington, Del., diversified services company with
executive offices in Philadelphia, had been fighting Neoax since
Jan. 6, when the Connecticut firm launched a $17.50-a-share offer
for IU.
   IU on Feb. 23 agreed to a $21.50 a share leveraged buyout led by
members of management and the investment firm Dean Witter Capital
Corp., but Neoax quickly raised its bid to $22 a share and the
leveraged buyout proposal later was withdrawn.
   Neoax's new offer will expire at 9 a.m. EST March 21, according
to Neoax spokesman Joe Mansi. As of Sunday, Neoax had received
tenders of about 1.2 million IU shares under its tender offer.
   IU was founded 64 years ago in Philadelphia as a holding company
for electric and gas utilities in the United States and Canada. By
the early 1980s the company had evolved into one of the country's
biggest trucking companies. Its current businesses include paper
and food distribution, trucking and environmental services,
including waste management and slag recovery at steel mills.
   Neoax is the former White Motor Corp., a major manufacturer of
large trucks. It sought protection under Chapter 11 of of the
Federal Bankruptcy Act in 1980, emerging 3{ years later as
Northeast Ohio Axle Inc., which was changed to Neoax in 1986. It
has acquired 11 manufacturing operations since 1983.
   Neoax indicated last month that it had received $383 million in
short-term ``bridge'' financing from Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc. for the buyout.
   IU in 1987 posted a profit of $13.5 million, down from $88.3
million a year earlier, on revenue of $1.57 billion, up from $1.35
billion in 1986.
   The 1987 results included a $12.7 million loss on the sale of
certain operations, while the 1986 results included a $12.8 million
gain from the sale of some operations, a $40 million tax credit and
a $1.8 million gain from an accounting change.
   Profits from continuing operations rose to $28.6 million from
$22.4 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Report Says Iraq Develops New Oilfields To Boost Output</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is developing new oil fields that
will boost its production by 600,000 barrels a day within the next
few years, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday.
   The respected oil industry weekly newsletter, published in
Nicosia, quoted authoritative Iraqi oil sources as saying the
Soviet Technoexport company has started work on developing the
giant West Gurna field in southern Iraq.
   It is expected to start production within two years with an
initial capacity of around 200,000 barrels a day, the weekly said.
   A second phase to be carried out in the early 1990s, will raise
the capacity of the field, discovered in 1973, to more than 600,000
barrels daily, the newsletter added.
   Iraq is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, but refuses to accept a production quota like the other
12 members of the cartel unless it is equal to Iran's quota of 2.4
million barrels a day.
   Oil industry sources say Iraq's current output is now about
level with Iran's. Iraq has said it plans to boost its production
to around 3 million barrels a day by the end of the year.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.

   Isuzu Motors Ltd. will purchase U.S.-made engines
for vehicles it exports and Isuzu trucks produced in the United
States, a company spokesman said Monday.
   Isuzu Motors plans to purchase 30,000 gasoline engines from
General Motors Co. annually, of which 10,000 units will be imported
to Japan, Takashi Fujii said.
   The GM engine will be used in about 10 percent of the small
pickup trucks and multi-purpose four-wheel drive cars Izusu plans
to export to the United States from this fall, Fujii said.
   The remaining 20,000 engines will be installed in a third of the
60,000 small pickup trucks Izusu will produce annually in an
Indiana factory set up jointly with Fuji Heavy Industries, to begin
in the fall of 1989.
   The American engines will boost the amount of locally supplied
parts from 60 percent to 70 percent, the original target, Fujii
said.
   The engines that Isuzu plans to purchase are six-cylinder
gasoline engines, which GM uses for passenger and commercial
vehicles, he said.

<HEAD>De Benedetti Names Allies in Bid for Societe Generale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti on
Monday named new international partners to help him in his bid for
control of Societe Generale de Belgique SA.
   Cerus SA, the French investment firm through which De Benedetti
is vying for control of Belgium's largest holding company, said the
alliance controlled 47.01 percent of share capital of Societe
Generale.
   The group is opposed by a Franco-Belgian alliance which claims a
majority stake of 52 percent.
   For the first time, Cerus said the Swiss bank Banque Financiere
de la Cite, Australia's FAI Insurances Ltd. company and the U.S.
company Odyssey Partners were helping its bid for control of the
company which has a stake in a third of the Belgian economy.
   Earlier known partners are the U.S. investment firm Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., the Swiss bank Companie de Banque et
d'Investissements and two Belgian partners.
   On Monday, the Dutch technology giant N.V. Philips and the Swiss
food company Nestle SA were invited to become partners.
   Cerus, Shearson and CBI have formed the holding company Europe
1992 in support of their bid. Europe 1992 refers to the date when
goods, services and people should be able to move without
restrictions in the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   De Benedetti wants to turn Societe Generale in a pan-European
holding company.
   De Benedetti's rival group is formed around Belgium's biggest
insurer, Groupe AG, and the French investment firm Companie
Financiere de Suez. That group wants to keep the 166-year-old
Societe Generale firmly anchored in Belgium.
   Both sides have said they wanted to discuss the future of
Societe Generale. But the Franco-Belgian alliance has said De
Benedetti must first renounce his ambition to take a leading role
in the company and stressed it could also act unilaterally.
   De Benedetti still has a public offer going for more shares to
get control of the company. But to extend his offer he needed to
name his allies.
   Cerus said within its alliance, Europe 1992 had 15.9 percent of
Societe Generale's 28.2 million shares, CBI 11.72 percent, Cerus,
9.02 percent, BFC and FAI each 3.24 percent, Odyssey 0.97 percent
and others 2.92 percent.
   Cerus said this breakdown did not include the initial results of
its bid for an additional 7 percent of Societe Generale stock.
   De Benedetti was told to name his allies by Belgium's banking
commission, a regulatory agency, as a condition for getting
approval to extend the bid.
   Societe Generale has a stake in some 1,400 companies around the
world and has important interests in Belgium's energy sector,
technology development, strategic resources and the nation's
relationship with its former colony Zaire.

   South Korea's three automakers
reported Monday their combined exports soared 97.4 percent in
February, to 49,879 cars from 25,270 the same month last year.
   Officials said the February shipments were mostly passenger cars
and that more than 90 percent of them to the United States and
Canada. No breakdown by country was given.
   Hyundai Motor Co. topped the list with 33,803 autos, followed by
Kia Motors Corp. with 10,360 and Daewoo Motor with 5,716. No
year-earlier statistics were given.
   To the United States and Canada, Hyundai shipped 29,593 unts and
Daewoo 5,536. Kia said almost all of its February exports went to
the United States.
   The three Korean automakers' worldwide exports in the first two
months of this year totaled 95,687 cars, up 91.6 percent from the
same period last year.
   Hyundai's two month share was 69,636 cars, followed by Kia with
13,745 and Daewoo with 12,306.
   The three companies said they plan to export 685,000 cars this
year, up about 25 percent from last year.

   A South Korean feed grain purchase
mission is scheduled to tour the United States later this month to
help reduce the country's trade surplus, the Agriculture and
Fisheries Ministry said Monday.
   Officials said the group, led by President Park Chan-kung of the
Korea Feed Association, will visit Iwoa, Missouri and other states
to puchase 1 million tons of feed grain such as corn and soy beans.
   Park's aides said the mission is scheduled to leave Korea March
20 and stay in the United States for about 10 days.
   The group also will visit Washington to meet with U.S.
administration officials and Congressmen to try to ease growing
American pressure on Korea to buy beef and other American farm
products.
   The United States has threatened to take retaliatory steps if
Korea failed to lift import restrictions. The United States ran a
trade deficit of nearly $10 billion with Korea last year.

<TEXT>
   China's Communist Party has proposed amending the
national constitution to protect the rights of private businesses
and permit the transfer of land-use rights, the official China
Daily said Monday.
   The report said the amendments would ensure privately owned
entities, an increasingly important sector in the Chinese economy,
the right to exist and develop as a complement to China's socialist
system.
   Private businesses, defined as individually owned enterprises
with eight or more workers, have existed since 1981, two years
after China launched economic reform programs based on encouraging
personal initiative and a market-oriented economy.
   The newspaper said there are now about 225,000 such enterprises.
China also has what it calls an individual economy, about 18
million people who run street stalls and other one-man or family
operations.
   The newspaper said the party has submitted the proposals to the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, which opened a
meeting Saturday, and asked the committee to put them on the agenda
of the annual full session of the NPC, convening later this month.

<HEAD>Japanese Favor Accepting Foreign Workers in Certain Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The majority of Japanese responding to an opinion
poll favored accepting temporary foreign workers into Japan if
their skills and effciency are needed, the Economic Planning Agency
said Monday.
   An agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
11.0 percent of those responding thought Japan should allow
temporary foreign laborers, such as construction workers, waiters,
maids and waitresses, to find work in Japan without any conditions.
   He said 63 percent said Japan should accept foreign workers
under certain conditions. Only 4.8 percent opposed Japan's
acceptance of any foreign workers at all, the official said.
   The agency questioned 3,000 people aged 20 or over and 1,000
firms throughout the nation at random last October.
   Among Japanese firms that had employed foreign workers, 62.7
percent of those responding said they would employ them in the
future, while 3.1 percent said they would not employ them any more.
The others said they did not know.
   Of the Japanese firms that never had employed foreign workers,
21.9 percent of those responding said they would employ them in the
future and 29.9 percent said they would not.
   In general, Japan now limits foreigners working here to
scholars, language teachers, technicians and performing artists,
including musicians and dancers.
   But an increasig number of foreigners have been working
illegally in Japan, where wages paid in the strong yen currency
make jobs more attractive.
   Last year, the number of foreigners who violated Japan's
immigration laws _ mostly by working illegally _ rose by 33.6
percent from a year earlier to a record 14,129, the Justice
Ministry said Monday.
   A ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
11,307 people were caught overstaying their visas and working
illegally.
   The Labor Ministry asked employers in late January not to hire
any foreigners who have only tourist visas.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's
exports dropped 1 percent in 1987, but imports among the 12 nations
edged up by the same amount, bringing the EEC's foreign trade into
balance.
   Eurostat, the Community's statistical service, said the EEC's
sluggish exports picked up in the third quarter, but not enough to
make up for lost ground.
   EEC economic data released Monday also showed that the
Community's industrial production rose an estimated 2 percent in
1987 from the previous year. The report said EEC industrial output
rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1987, the highest growth
rate for the past 18 months.
   Growth was boosted by a steep rise in the production of capital
goods, which gained 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with
the year-earlier period. This was the highest rate of growth for
capital production for two years, Eurostat said.
   Unemployment rose 2.6 percent in January from the previous
month, bringing the number of jobless to 16.7 million, Eurostat
said.
   However, it said that January's unemployment figure was about
2.7 percent below that in January 1987. The drop was caused by a
decline in the numbers of jobless in the Netherlands, Belgium,
Britain, Ireland, France and Denmark.

   The stock market headed lower today amid concern
over the interest-rate outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.13 to 2,050.73

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 399 up, 691 down and
454 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.88 million shares as of
midmorning.
   Prices and interest rates showed little change in early activity
in the bond market today.
   But developments late last week raised concern that the drop in
interest rates since last fall had about run its course.
   Rates rose sharply on Friday after the Labor Department reported
much stronger growth in unemployment than expected for February.
   If the economy is robust enough to support a big increase in
jobs, credit-market traders reason, the Federal Reserve is unlikely
to take any further steps soon to relax its credit policy.
   Mobil climbed ~ to 44{ in active trading. The company said it

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.63 to

   Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli today
launched a $1.86 billion offer for Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.,
complicating Firestone's plan to sell 75 percent of its tire-making
division to Bridgestone of Japan.
   Pirelli, in an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, offered
$58 a share cash for all 32 million Firestone common shares
outstanding.
   Pirelli said in a statement today its offer was conditioned on
acquiring at least two-thirds of Firestone's shares, on the
agreement beween Firestone and Bridgestone not being signed and on
the removal of Firestone's anti-takeover defenses.
   ``We won't have anything more to say until the board has had an
opportunity to make a review. I would expect that would begin
immediately,'' Firestone spokesman Robert Troyer told the Akron
Beacon Journal on Sunday in a telephone interview from Chicago,
home of Firestone's corporate headquarters.
   An acquisition of Firestone would substantially increase
Pirelli's current 1.5 percent share of the U.S. tire market, the
world's largest. It would also give the Italian company its first
manufacturing facilities in the United States.
   Wall Street analysts had speculated on Thursday that Pirelli
would make an offer for Firestone.
   Firestone's stock leaped $11.37{ a share in early trading today
to $61 a share, above Pirelli's $58-a-share offer, indicating that
speculators expected an even higher offer to emerge.
   Firestone stock closed at $49.62{ Friday, up $5.50 for the week
in heavy trading. Nearly 4.2 million shares of Firestone's common
stock changed hands last week, compared with about 850,000 in an
average week.
   It was not immediately clear what effect an investment or
takeover attempt by Pirelli would have on the pending proposed
joint venture between Firestone and Bridgestone Corp. Firestone's
board and ultimately shareholders will have to decide which offer
to accept.
   Pirelli could block the Bridgestone deal if it was able to
purchase a sufficient number of Firestone shares.
   Pirelli said today that if it was successful in its bid for
Firestone, it would spin off parts of the company to the French
group Michelin.
   Michelin would pay about $650 million to acquire Firestone's
Brazilian holdings as well as Master Care Inc., Firestone's U.S.
service company, Pirelli said.
   Michelin would also have an option to buy 50 percent of
Firestone's synthetic rubber and diversified product holdings in
the United States for about $150 million.
   On Feb. 16, Bridgestone and Firestone said they intended to form
a new Akron-based tire business, to be called Firestone Tire Co.,
that would own Firestone's worldwide tire manufacturing operation.
Bridgestone would own 75 percent of the joint venture.
   Firestone Chairman John J. Nevin has said the company wants to
distribute to shareholders ``a very substantial portion'' of about
$1 billion in cash that would be generated by the joint venture.
   Firestone has been considered an attractive target for both
foreign-based companies because of their interest in gaining U.S.
market share.
   Troyer said Bridgestone officials were notified upon learning of
possible action by Pirelli on Sunday.
   At the time the $1.5 billion Bridgestone deal was announced,
Firestone's board approved an anti-takeover measure that took
effect Tuesday.
   That measure would raise the cost of a takeover by creating a
special class of preferred stock in the event an individual or
group acquired 20 percent or more, or made a tender offer for 20
percent or more, of Firestone's stock without approval of the board.
   In a letter to shareholders released last week, Nevin said the
anti-takeover plan was not intended to prevent a fair offer for the
shares of the company and should not deter anyone from acquiring
the company if the buyer gives shareholders full value and
negotiates in good faith.
   Pirelli, headquartered in Milan, had sales of $3.65 billion last
year.

<HEAD>Supreme Court To Hear Merger Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a
Reagan administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to
take a bigger tax bite out of some corporate mergers.
   The court said it will review a ruling stemming from the
acquisition of a small West Virginia company by a corporation
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The smaller company, Basin Surveys Inc., was owned by Donald E.
Clark of Buckhannon, W.Va. It provides services to the petroleum
industry.
   Clark sold the business in 1979 to N.L. Industries of New York,
which produces petroleum equipment, chemicals and metals.
   N.L. Industries gave Clark 300,000 shares of its stock and $3.25
million to acquire Basin Surveys.
   At issue in the case was whether the cash payment, commonly
called ``boot,'' should be taxed as a capital gain or considered a
dividend and taxed as ordinary income. Generally, the capital gain
tax rate is lower.
   The tax reform bill enacted in 1986 eliminated the different tax
rates for capital gains and ordinary income.
   But the administration said the different treatment will still
apply to some corporate shareholders.
   Also, in urging the court to consider the government appeal,
Justice Department lawyers said Congress sometime in the future
might restore for all taxpayers the different treatment of ordinary
income and capital gains.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Clark
last September, sparing him from paying $972,505 in taxes.
   The appeals court said, ``We regard the boot as a cash payment
by N.L. in return for Clark's relinquishment of a portion of his
interest in the newly reorganized corporation. Because Clark
surrendered more than 20 percent of his interest in N.L., he is
entitled to capital gain treatment.''
   The appeals court arrived at the 20 percent figure by noting
that N.L. Industries offere Clark two choices in the merger: he
could receive either 425,000 shares of N.L. stock or 300,000 shares
plus $3.25 million in cash.
   The appeals court said Clark, by choosing the latter option, in
effect gave up more than 20 percent of his interest in N.L.
Industries in return for the cash.
   The appeals court said that under federal law a shareholder who
relinquishes more than 20 percent of his corporate control and is
less than a 50 percent shareholder after the transaction is
entitled to have cash proceeds from the transaction treated as
capital gains.
   Justice Department lawyers said the ruling is in conflict with
decisions by other federal appeals courts. They said the Supreme
Court should eliminate the confusion.
   The case is Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Clark, 87-1168.

   Manufacturers Hanover Corp., wounded from
possibly uncollectable Third World loans, is seeking to sell its
profitable consumer finance unit to raise capital, the Wall Street
Journal reported Monday.
   Quoting banking sources it did not identify, the newspaper said
the nation's sixth-largest banking concern is asking between $500
million and $600 million for Huntingdon Valley, Pa.-based
Manufacturers Hanover Consumer Services Inc., which has about $3
billion in assets.
   The banking company has been forced to take austerity measures
because of a $1.14 billion loss last year, due mainly to a $1.7
billion addition to reserves that reflected the questionable
collectability of some Third World loans, a problem afflicting many
American banks.
   John Meyers, a Manufacturers Hanover spokesman in New York, said
he could not comment on the Journal report. But he said the bank
has consistently stated it would rebuild capital partly via
property sales and expense cuts.
   ``We've said all along there is a host of assets we can realize
gains on,'' Meyers said. ``It is part of our game plan to get
shareholder equity replenished.''
   Banking industry analysts have said Manufacturers Hanover's
consumer finance business is considered highly prized and
profitable within the company, so a sale would reflect on the
seriousness of the bank's capital needs.
   On the other hand, the consumer finance unit is a stand-alone
operation, so it could be sold much more easily that other company
property.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Steady To Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened steady to
slightly higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures prices advanced on technical factors and on rumors
that the government plans to revise downward its estimate of the
amount of wheat it owns, analysts said.
   Corn futures were nearly unchanged in quiet trading.
   Soybeans opened almost unchanged after a sharp decline on Friday.
   Friday's massive sell-off of soybean futures swept a good deal
of speculative interest from the market, leaving it listless and
quiet, said Steve Freed, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Freed said he expected little movement in soybean futures during
the next three weeks barring major news that could affect the
market.
   ``I think we're dead in the water,'' he said. ``It's going to
take another Chernobyl to get us going again.''
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents higher across the board
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.05{ a bushel; corn
was } cent to 1 cent higher with March at $2 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1{ cents higher with March at $1.88\ a bushel;
soybeans were \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $6.15 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .40 cent to .70 cent higher with April at 70.80
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent to .43 cent higher with
March at 79.60 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to .45 cent higher
with April at 42.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45

<HEAD>Paper Group Forecasts Record Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production in the U.S. paper industry appears
poised for a third consecutive record-breaking year as demand
remains strong for all major grades of paper and paperboard, an
industry trade association said Monday.
   The American Paper Institute, a trade association for American
pulp, paper and paperboard companies, said production is running at
a rate of 75 million tons a year, or about 3 percent above its pace
at the same point last year.
   Production for all of 1987 amounted to a record 74.4 million
tons, up from 70.9 million tons in 1986, and is expected to rise by
about 2 percent in 1988, according to figures supplied by the trade
association.
   The group's forecast was released as it began its national
conference.
   The institute's president, Red Cavaney, said the forecast for
1988 presumes avoiding a recession, a pro-growth trade policy, a
fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax increases.
   Last year was also a record in terms of the dollar value of
paper and paperboard sales, the group said. It said it expects
final figures for 1987 will show sales of about $87 billion, or 16
percent more than the previous high of $74.8 billion set in 1986.
   The paper industry derived its strength in 1987 from heightened
demand in the various markets its serves, the institute said.
   Demand for white papers, for instance, reflected trends such as
increased use of office copy and computer printout papers and of
envelopes.
   Strength in direct-mail advertising helped fuel robust growth in
commercial printing, stimulating printing paper demand, the paper
institute said.
   Paperboard production set a record last year as packaged goods
production surged, triggering increased demand for paper used for
shipping containers, folding cartons and fiber cans, the institute
said.
   Newspapers and the high quality color-printed advertising pieces
that retailers and businesses use to reach their customers
performed strongly in 1987, the group said, pushing newsprint
production to a new high last year.
   Exports of market pulp and paper products reached a high in 1987
as a decline in the dollar made them more competitive with prices
charged overseas, the institute said.
   While sales surged in 1987, so did the profits of paper
companies that had already begun aggressive cost-containment
programs, the institute said.
   It said after-tax profits in the U.S. paper industry rose 56
percent in the first three quarters of 1987, reaching a decade high
of 5.7 percent of sales.

<HEAD>No Tax Break From Stock Losses, Court Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses that lose money from the sale of
stock aren't entitled to special tax breaks no matter why the stock
was purchased, the Supreme Court decided today.
   The court, voting 8-0, ruled against an Arkansas conglomerate
that sought to claim as an ordinary-loss deduction for federal tax
purposes a $10 million loss from the sale of stock in a Texas bank
it once controlled.
   Arkansas Best Corp. of Fort Smith in 1969 had acquired more than
65 percent of the stock of National Bank of Commerce, the fourth
largest bank in Dallas.
   Congress passed a law in 1970 that prohibited conglomerates that
owned a bank from expanding their non-bank business through new
acquisitions in other industries.
   Arkansas Best, which owns trucking, furniture manufacturing,
data processing and other businesses, decided to divest itself of
the bank stock. The 1970 law gave it 10 years to sell the bank
stock.
   Because of public awareness that Arkansas Best was under legal
obligation to divest itself, disposing of the bank stock without
taking a big loss was difficult.
   At the same time, the bank's finances were deteriorating.
Arkansas Best therefore acquired additional stock in the bank in an
attempt to keep it solvent.
   The conglomerate began selling off the bank stock in 1975, and
sought to claim the losses as ordinary losses rather than capital
losses _ a tax advantage.
   The Internal Revenue Service ruled that the losses suffered by
Arkansas Best were capital losses. The IRS rejected Arkansas Best's
arguments that the stock was not bought for typical investment
purposes but for business purposes _ and therefore its sale should
yield ordinary losses.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the IRS but
other federal appeals courts had reached conflicting conclusions.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice Thurgood Marshall said
motivation behind the stock purchase is irrelevant ``to the
question whether the asset is property held by a taxpayer ... and
is thus within (federal tax law's) general definition of capital
asset.''
   ``Because the capital stock held by (Arkansas Best) falls within
the broad definition of the term `capital asset' in (the tax code)
and is outside the classes of property excluded from capital-asset
status, the loss arising from the sale of the stock is a capital
loss,'' Marshall said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the decision.
   The case is Arkansas Best vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
86-751.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices and interest rates stabilized in
quiet early trading today following Friday's sell-off.
   ``The market seems to be on dead center right now,'' said
Marshall B. Front, an economist at Stein Roe & Farnham, a Chicago
investment and mutual-fund management firm. ``There doesn't seem to
be any news affecting the market.''
   By midday, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up about 1-32 point
while its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to
8.46 percent from 8.47 percent late Friday.
   The bellwether issue had plunged about two points, or $20 per
$1,000 in face amount, on Friday, after the government reported
unexpectedly high February employment levels, raising doubts about
forecasts of an economic slowdown later this year.
   The government said the economy created half a million jobs last
month, dropping the civilian unemployment rate to 5.7 percent, its
lowest since 1979. The January rate had been 5.8 percent.
   Front said the market was currently involved in a ``tug of war''
of sorts on the outlook for interest rates.
   ``The bulls point to lower commodity prices _ the price of gold
continues to fall, oil prices continue to slip _ and other signs of
weakness in economic activity,'' he said. ``The bears look at the
employment numbers ... which were shockingly good and say ... the
economy is likely to accelerate.
   ``I think a lot of people are going back to their drawing
boards.''
   Interest rates have fallen sharply since fears of recession
surfaced after the stock market crash five months ago. But
bondholders worry that with some signs of economic growth, the
Federal Reserve may want to tighten its credit policies, thus
pushing interest rates higher, to prevent inflation from heating up.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds today, prices of
short-term governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities rose
1-32 point and 20-year issues were off 1-32 point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.01 to 113.3. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, lost 0.04
to 1,183.34.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged
in light trading, according to the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, was off 0.06 to 284.36.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up 2 basis points to
5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills -fell 1 basis point to 5.94 percent and one-year
bills were unchanged at 6.27 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6 9-16 percent, up from 6{ percent late Friday.

<HEAD>Third Qtr Earnings Up 22 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading foodmaker H.J. Heinz Co. reported a 22
percent surge in third-quarter earnings Monday, attributing the
improvement to higher sales volume, acquisitions and the beneficial
effects of a cheaper dollar.
   The company said earnings for the three months ended Jan. 27
totaled $91 million or 69 cents a share, compared with $74.7
million or 55 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Sales
totaled $1.25 billion vs. $1.08 billion, a 15 percent rise.
   ``We are encouraged by the earnings record achieved to date
through our existing business base as well as the superior market
opportunities offered by our strategic world-wide acquisitions,''
said Chairman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly. ``We are optimistic that we
will again achieve fiscal year results consisted with our
historical trends.''
   The Pittsburgh-based company embarked on a series of
acquisitions last year, notably in the pet-food business, in which
it bought Mavar and California Home Brands, two American concerns.
Heinz also recently acquired Orlando S.A., an important Spanish
food company.
   The dollar's depreciation also helped Heinz because its
U.S.-produced foods became more competitive overseas. At the same
time, profits from goods produced and sold by Heinz's foreign
operations rose when converted into dollars.
   For the nine-months ended Jan. 27, Heinz said it earned $284.3
million or $2.14 a share, a 16.3 percent gain over the $244.4
million or $1.78 a share in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 13
percent from $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by the low dollar and
cheaper air fares, Europeans from Spain to Scandinavia are
rediscovering America at a record pace.
   Tourist visa applications are flooding U.S. consulates across
Western Europe, and tour operators say the number of bookings to
the United States is up sharply from last year's record.
   ``The numbers (of visa applicants) are increasing
dramatically,'' said Ira Levy, chief of the non-immigrant visa
branch at the U.S. Embassy in London.
   Donald Mudd, chief of consular services at the U.S. Consulate in
Frankfurt, said the consulate issued about 600,000 tourist visas
last year.
   ``We expect a 30 percent to 50 percent rise this year, and this
pretty much reflects the rest of Western Europe,'' Mudd told The
Associated Press.
   The Association of European Airlines, which includes 21 major
airline companies, said the total number of Europeans flying to the
United States has increased about 48 percent since 1985.
   According to the most recent statistics available to the
Brussels-based association, 7.2 million Europeans took flights to
the United States from January to October 1987.
   Officials across Western Europe polled by the AP said the first
two months of this year indicate that 1988 will be a boom year for
travel to the United States.
   Britain and West Germany provide the bulk of tourists visiting
the United States, and the two countries are expected to combine
for nearly 2 million U.S. trips this year.
   Levy said the number of non-immigrant visas issued in Britain
for the United States was expected to reach 900,000 this year from
642,000 in 1987.
   January saw a 69 percent increase in non-immigant visas over
January 1987, and February figures rose 66 percent over the same
month last year, Levy said.
   Sheila Beecham, owner of American Round-up, a travel agency in
Hemel Hempstead, 25 miles north of London, said her business was
flourishing.
   ``The growth in America travel because of the dollar recently is
tremendous. In the last three months I've had the same amount of
business as all last year,'' said Ms. Beecham, whose agency
specializes in adventure vacations to the Western states.
   In West Germany, where the dollar has dropped 50 percent in
three years, travel agencies also are thriving as U.S. tours become
cheaper.
   ``Our January figures are 25 percent over last January's when we
had 25,705 bookings,'' said Rolf Nielander of Deutsches Reisebuero,
a travel agency.
   His agency offers two-week trips to Florida for $1,000 dollars,
only $350 more than a two-week stay at a Mediterranean resort.
   The Swiss are also frequent international travelers: 235,000 of
them visited the United States last year, a 27 percent increase
over 1986. A further rise is expected this year.
   In Greece, a Pam Am official in Athens said bookings for U.S.
destinations were up 30 percent this year compared with 1987.
   Alex Pantelides, manager of Manos Travel System, Greece's
largest travel agency, said the dollar's drop was a windfall for
U.S. trips.
   ``America is much better value for money compared to Europe.''
   In Italy, Mark Dillen, spokesman for the American Embassy in
Rome, said there has been a 12 percent increase in the past five
months in tourist visa applications for the United States, compared
with the same period in 1987.
   In Spain, U.S. officials reported a 60 percent to 70 percent
rise in the number of visa applications, and in the Netherlands
they said it was up 38 percent in the last five months.

<TEXT>
   Script writers struck movie and television
producers today and the union predicted viewers of talk shows, game
shows and daytime soaps would quickly notice a difference in
programming.
   Hundreds of writers grabbed ``The Writers Guild Strikes''
placards depicting a quill and lightning bolt as mid-morning picket
lines snaked in front of Twentieth Century Fox studios.
   The Writers Guild of America rejected a final offer presented
Sunday by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
and called a walkout for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. The 600 WGA
news writers are exempt from this action.
   The strike began here and in New York City at 9 a.m. PST today.
The contract expired at midnight Feb. 29.
   Marty Waldman, a WGA spokesman in New York, said there would be
no picketing in the East today.
   ``The longer the strike goes on, the more reruns the public will
see,'' said Brian Walton, WGA West executive director and chief
negotiator. ``It's a very tight ratings race and unfortunately for
the networks it will impact them.''
   Picket captain Stanley Ralph Ross said selection of Fox's West
Los Angeles studio ``was fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and
location had a lot to do with it.
   ``We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking around
here,'' Ross said.
   ``Grandview U.S.A.'' writer Ken Hixon, who marched with his
2-year old son, Sam, said writers were much more unified for this
strike than in their last walkout in 1985.
   ``There was nearly a civil war last time between screen writers
and television writers. But this time there's real solidarity,''
Hixon said.
   ``Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs
relying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and the
soaps will see a difference right away,'' said guild spokeswoman
Cheryl Rhoden.
   The strike slows down the production process and if prolonged,
``it finally comes to a halt,'' she said. A three-month strike
delayed the fall television season three years ago.
   Walton said the network that would be hardest hit would be
first-place NBC, whose ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,''
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Late Night With David Letterman,''
would be affected immediately.
   Edward Adler, president of WGA East, said nine soap operas on
the East Coast and five in California also would be affected
immediately, as would prime time miniseries, television movies and
features in development or in production.
   But Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the alliance, which
represents 200 producers and studios, said a strike was anticipated
and scripts have been stockpiled.
   ``Shows like Carson's show will go into reruns. But we will
continue business,'' he said.
   Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some
one-hour shows syndicated in the United States and said they
couldn't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets.
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000 a year, but
about half of the guild's members are unemployed at any given time,
said Rhoden. The writers sought the first change in 17 years in how
they are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets.
They now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is
negotiated between the writer and producer.
   The writers also demanded more artistic control on the final
product.
   ``We had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short of
giving them total control,'' Steinberg said. ``The director is the
captain of that creative team. We couldn't bargain away rights that
belonged to other guilds and unions.''
   The producers had offered a $50 million package over a
three-year period, including improvements in pension and health
plans, Steinberg said.
   In union ballots last week in Los Angeles and New York, 96
percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached.
   The last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks.
Since the WGA won its first contract in 1947, script writers
conducted strikes five times, more than any other entertainment
industry union.
   Separately, the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists bargained through the weekend with
makers of TV and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerun
payments for 100,000 actors.
   Members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent margin
in recent votes, said SAG spokesman Mark Locher.

   Insurance giant Fireman's Fund Corp. will

   Based on American Express's stock price of $27.50 a share Monday

   Fireman's Fund also has an option to purchase an additional 4.5
million of its shares from American Express for $162 million, the
companies said.
   If the agreement is approved by boards of both companies,
Fireman's Fund will terminate a previously announced plan to
repurchase some of its stock on the open market or via a private
purchase, the companies said in a statement.
   American Express once owned 100 percent of Fireman's Fund shares
but later decided to get out of the property and casualty insurance
business and began selling the company's stock. Upon completion of
the agreement announced Monday, American Express would own 20
percent of Fireman's Fund.
   American Express is a diversified financial and travel services
concern that owns Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., one of the largest
Wall Street brokerages. Fireman's Fund is an insurance holding
company that owns Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., one of the largest
property-casualty insurers.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in European trading Monday. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the British pound gained almost 4
cents against the dollar _ a remarkable one-day advance _ and also
rose against every other currency.
   Reports in London that British interest rates would stay high
and that the economy was growing at a strong pace were credited for
the pound's strength.
   Sterling's rise quickened when it became clear the state-run
Bank of England was not selling pounds to prevent sterling from
rising against the West German mark.
   A higher exchange rate means British goods become more expensive
abroad. The bank's refusal to act was in line with government
policy to encourage companies to be more competitive by becoming
more efficient.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8135 late Monday, up from
$1.7740 late Friday.
   Other late rates for the dollar late Monday, compared with late
Friday's rates, included: 1.6765 West German marks, down from
1.6940; 1.3870 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030; 5.6880 French
francs, down from 5.7300; 1.8840 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010;
1.239.75 Italian lire, down from 1,248.00; and 1.2562 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2547.
   In Tokyo earlier, the dollar closed at 128.87 Japanese yen, down
from 129.22 late Friday.In London late Monday, the dollar traded at
128.30 yen.
   Gold prices were mixed. In London, the major trading center,
gold closed at a late bid price of $437.20 a troy ounce, down from
$437.50 late Friday. The late bid price in Zurich was $436, up from
$432 late Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $438.75, up from $438.21.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.42 a troy
ounce, up from $6.41.

   The federal government and Morton Thiokol Inc.
bought annuities for $7,735,000 to settle the claims by survivors
of four of the astronauts who died aboard the space shuttle
Challenger, according to documents released today.
   Morton Thiokol, the company that produced the faulty booster
rocket blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion, paid 60 percent of
the total cost of buying the annuities, or $4,641,000, the Justice
Department acknowledged. The government's share, 40 percent, cost
$3,094,000.
   The families will actually receive more than $7.7 million
because the annuities pay out over a period of many years. The
total they will receive and the breakdown by family were not
released.
   The documents, along with several Justice Department statements
describing how the settlements were reached, were released to
settle a civil suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act by
The Associated Press and six other news organizations. The
government had originally kept all details of the settlements and
how they were reached secret.
   The settlements were reached by the government and the company
with the immediate survivors of spacecraft commander Dick Scobee,
46, a retired Air Force officer employed by NASA; mission
specialist Ellison S. Onizuka, 39, an Air Force lieutenant colonel;
payload specialist Gregory Jarvis, 41, an employee of Hughes
Aircraft Co., and Christa McAuliffe, 37, a Concord, N.H., high
school teacher.
   Scobee was survived by his wife, June, and two adult children;
Onizuka, by his wife, Lorna, and two minor children; Jarvis, by his
wife, Marcia, and McAuliffe, by her husband, Steven, and two minor
children.
   The government said in court documents filed during the suit
that it began negotiations with these four and an informa
representative on June 18, 1986. The settlements were announced
Dec. 29, 1986.
   The government's document make clear that the survivors of the
four had no legal representation during the negotiations, but
received informal assistance from Leo B. Lind, Jr., the executor of
McAuliffe's estate and her husband's law partner.
   Lind said in an affidavit that the families never spoke directly
to Morton Thiokol officials. The families dealt only with Justice
Department lawyers, who negotiated with them on behalf of the
contractor.
   A presidential commission blamed the explosion on a plume of hot
gas that leaked through a joint in a solid-fuel booster rocket
built by Morton Thiokol and ignited the main fuel tank. The
fireball consumed the Challenger 73 seconds after launch from the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The astronauts are believed by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to have died before
the debris hit the Atlantic Ocean.
   Survivors of two other Challenger astronauts and Jarvis' father
have reached settlements with Morton Thiokol to which the
government did not contribute.
   Last month, Marvin Resnik, the divorced father of mission
specialist Judith A. Resnik, 36, a civilian NASA employee, settled
with the company for an amount he said was ``commensurate with what
some of the others got _ from $2 million to $3.5 million.''
   In January, Sarah Resnik Belfer, divorced mother of the
astronaut, and Bruce Jarvis, father of the Hughes employee, settled
with the company. The amounts were not disclosed.
   Last May, the company settled a suit by Cheryl McNair, wife of
mission specialist Ronald E. McNair, 35, a civilian NASA employee
who also left two infant children. The amount was not disclosed.
   Jane Smith, wife of pilot Michael J. Smith, 40, a Navy
commander, has a suit pending in federal court in Florida against
the company. The government last month succeeded in having itself
dismissed as a defendant in that suit on the basis of a Supreme
Court decision that survivors of active duty military personnel may
not sue the government for wrongful death.
   A separate settlement agreement between the government and
Morton Thiokol covered only the claims by the survivors of the four
astronauts. That agreement in no way ``abrogates any claim of any
nature which the United States may have against MTI for property
damage associated with the Challenger accident, including but not
limited to any claims for the loss of the Orbiter itself,'' the
document said. The replacement orbiter now under construction is
expected to cost $3 billion.
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said today that negotiations are
continuing between NASA and company lawyers on the type and amount
of penalties that will be imposed on the Utah rocket-maker's
contract with the government.
   A NASA statement in February 1987 said that Morton Thiokol would
forfeit $10 million in profit and would receive no profit from $409
million worth of redesign work. But Garrett said that does not
represent the end of the matter.
   ``Our lawyers are playing with it; it's in the hands of the
general counsel,'' he said.

   The stock market gave ground today amid concern
over the interest-rate outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.11 to
2,046.75 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 in the overall tally

   Prices and interest rates showed little change in the bond
market today. But developments late last week raised concern that
the drop in interest rates since last fall had about run its course.
   Rates rose sharply on Friday after the Labor Department reported
much stronger growth in employment than expected for February.

jobs, credit-market traders reason, the Federal Reserve is unlikely
to take any further steps soon to relax its credit policy.
   Given that prospect, investors seemed to be focusing their
attention mainly on numerous stocks involved in takeovers and other
deals.
   Firestone Tire & Rubber jumped 12 to 61|. Pirelli Group of Italy
made a $58-a-share bid to acquire the company, which is planning to
sell its tire business to Japan's Bridgestone Corp.
   Roper Corp. climbed 10~ to 48\. General Electric made a

   Estimated figures for the year to date showed production at
17.769 million net tons, an increase of 38.4 percent from the
12.837 million net tons in the previous year. The steel operations
of USX Corp., the nation's largest steel producer, were shut down

   The number of oil and gas rigs working in the
United States decreased by five this week to total 978, Baker
Hughes Inc. announced.
   The total reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil
as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. The
previous week, the count had increased by five to 983.
   A year ago, the rig count was 766, Baker Hughes announced Monday.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number
of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched industry index
of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged last year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981 _ the height of the oil boom. But as oil prices plunged to
less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, the count
fell to 663, the lowest since Hughes began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Oklahoma gained seven rigs
this week, Wyoming gained five, while Colorado, New Mexico and Ohio
increased by two each.
   The rig count in Michigan dropped by one, while California,
Kansas, and Louisiana each lost three. Texas and Pennsylvania each
lost four rigs and Wyoming's rig count dropped by five.

<HEAD>Strong Second-Quarter Growth in Hiring Predicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A significant number of American companies will
bolster hiring this spring, a leading temporary job service said
Monday in an unusually optimistic quarterly forecast on U.S.
employment.
   Manpower Inc. said its Employment Outlook Survey indicated 29
percent of respondents plan to raise employment rolls in the
April-June quarter, while 6 percent expect declines. Sixty-two
percent plan no change and 3 percent don't know, the survey stated.
   Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower president, said it was the
strongest spring hiring forecast in four years and suggested
manufacturers in all regions of the country are unusually buoyant
about the economy.
   Makers of large durable goods are among the most optimistic of
all employers, with 32 percent planning payroll increases and 7
percent planning cutbacks, the survey showed.
   Among construction companies, 36 percent anticipate payroll
increases and 7 percent anticipate cutbacks. Among retailers, 31
percent plan increased payrolls and 6 percent plan decreases.
   Even in the financial services industry, which was particularly
affected by the October collapse in stock prices, the spring hiring
forecast was still optimistic. Twenty-three percent of respondents
plan to add employees and 7 percent will cut back.
   Manpower has issued the quarterly survey for the past 12 years
and calls it as a significant indicator of employment trends.
   Conducted in last two weeks of February, the survey was based on
telephone interviews with more than 13,000 public and private
employers in 401 U.S. cities. The margin of error is 5 percent, the
company said.
   Based in Milwaukee, Manpower describes itself as the world's
largest temporary service firm, annually providing jobs to more
than 700,000 people through 1,350 offices in 33 countries.

<TEXT>
   Consumers have regained virtually all the
confidence they lost as a result of the October stock market crash,
but there are indications employers could be cutting back their
hiring plans, according to two surveys released Monday.
   The Conference Board, in issuing its monthly Consumer Confidence
Index, said consumers have been heartened by continuing strength in
the economy.
   However, the business research organization said consumers also
may be feeling more optimistic because their paychecks are larger
because of tax cuts that took effect Jan. 1.
   The Consumer Confidence Index was 113.9 points in February, up
from January's 109.9 points and 100.8 in November, after the crash.
   The index, which uses a 1985 base of 100, stood at 115.1 in
October, before the Oct. 19 stock collapse.
   The Conference Board's Help Wanted Index painted a somewhat less
optimistic picture. The index, which reflects the amount of help
wanted ads in 51 major newspapers across the nation, declined to
153 in January from 155 in December.
   The index, which uses a 1967 base of 100, reflects changes in
demand for labor and general business conditions.
   Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said the drop
in the index signaled a slowdown in hiring plans by employers.
   ``Recent dips in want ad volume suggest that companies are
taking a hard look at their expansion plans,'' he said.
   Help wanted advertising volume fell in six of nine regions of
the country: New England, the Rockies, Pacific, South Atlantic,
Middle Atlantic and East South Central. Ad volume increased in the
West North Central, East North Central and West South Central areas.

   Takeover news and speculation provided most of
the excitement in an otherwise quiet, drifting stock market session
Monday.
   Analysts said the general market was held back by new doubts
about the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.49 to 2,056.37.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the New

Developments late last week raised concern that the drop in

   If the economy is robust enough to support a big increase in

<HEAD>Livestock Futures Soar As Market Looks Forward To Greater Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock and meat futures prices rose sharply Monday as traders
looked beyond the cash market's current problems and saw meat sales
improving in the months ahead.
   On other markets, energy futures slid lower; grains and soybeans
were mostly higher; precious metals retreated; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Slack retail demand for meat during Lent led to a slowdown in
slaughters last week, prompting fears of a growing supply of
slaughter-ready cattle and hogs.
   Analysts said those fears, along with the closing of at least
one major beef packing plant, were largely responsible for losses
on livestock futures last week at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   But indications of a cattle buildup did not surface Monday,
leading many traders to rethink their positions and look ahead to a
resurgence in demand after Easter, analysts said.
   ``Prices went down last week on ideas we were backing up cattle
(but) we haven't seen any proof of that yet,'' said Charlie
Richardson, an analyst in Denver for Lind-Waldock & Co.
   In Chicago, Philip Stanley of Thomson-McKinnon Securities Inc.
said traders had turned their attention to the future and away from
the industry's current woes.
   ``They're thinking that retail demand will pick up, packers will
have to accumulate supplies and the cattle feeders will reap the
profits by being able to sell cattle at higher prices,'' Stanley
said.
   Richardson said some traders also bought livestock futures on
ideas that prices for future delivery of cattle and hogs had fallen
more sharply than conditions warranted.
   And some were betting that a winter storm moving into the Great
Plains would disrupt the movement of animals to market, resulting
in temporarily tight supplies and higher prices, Richardson said.
   The bullish enthusiasm for cattle futures overflowed into the
pork pits, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .87 cent to 1.38 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in April at 71.55 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .80 cent to 1.10 cents higher with March at 80.35 cents
a pound; hogs were .25 cent to 1.25 cents higher with April at
43.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.20 cents to 1.85
cents higher with March at 54.70 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices retreated in moderate trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange following a slight advance in the previous
session.
   Analysts attributed the decline to speculation that some member
nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were
selling oil at a discount.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 22 cents
lower with April at $15.37 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent to
.25 cent lower with April at 43.41 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .34 cent to .57 cent lower with April at 43.94 cents a
gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade, although soybean futures were mixed.
   Expectations of new export business supported the markets.
   The Agriculture Department announced after the close that it had
sold 1.6 million bushels of wheat Friday in the last of last week's
three auctions for surplus, government-owned wheat.
   The USDA had targeted 10 million bushels for sale at that
auction.
   The agency also announced it would hold three auctions a week,
each with a 10-million-bushel target, through March 25.
   Wheat settled } cent to 2 cents higher with March at $3.04 a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2} cents higher with March at $2.00} a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 4 cents higher with March at $1.90} a
bushel; soybeans were 1\ cent lower to 2{ cents higher with March
at $6.13} a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures retreated slightly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   But despite its weak tone, the market appeared to have shaken
off the recessionary expectactions that had weighed on prices in
recent weeks, said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower with April at $438.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 3.5 cents lower with March at
$6.395 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.10 points higher at 268.30. The underlying spot
index closed nearly unchanged at 267.38.

<HEAD>Judge Says He Will Order New UAW Region 5 Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Monday he will order a new
election in the contested race for director of United Auto Workers
union's eight-state Southwest region, ending part of a 21-month
legal battle.
   ``It's a victory for the people in Region 5 who've had to
operate without a legally elected director for 21 months,'' said
Jerry Tucker, who lost by two-tenths of a vote to incumbent Region
5 director Kenneth Worley in the August 1986 election.
   Judge Richard Suhrheinrich of the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan heard arguments from attorneys for the
U.S. Department of Labor, the UAW and Tucker, assistant director of
Region 5 who was fired after he announced plans to run against his
boss in May 1986.
   Tucker is the leader of a dissident group within the UAW called
the New Directions Movement, which has called for less cooperation
with companies that are forcing workers to compete with each other
for jobs.
   The Labor Department investigated the contest and called for new
elections after it found some votes at the convention were cast by
illegal delegates.
   It also found that Worley spent $13,000 in union money on
jackets bearing his name, which were distributed at the UAW
constitutional convention where the delegates voted, and sent out
campaign fliers typed with a UAW typewriter on UAW stationery in a
UAW office.
   Labor Department attorney Janet Graney, who argued three
lawsuits the department brought against the UAW concerning the
election, said such uses of union money and equipment for the
campaign of an individual are illegal.
   ``I'm going to order a new election. There have been substantial
uses of union facilities'' for Worley's campaign, Suhrheinrich
said, adding that he would issue a formal order in two weeks.
   The UAW declined comment until it receives the order. The union
has said it is willing only to run some of the delegate elections
over.
   In a new election, 68 local unions in Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and New Mexico will
again choose 650 delegates who will vote for the director of Region
5 at a mini-convention.
   The elections will not affect terms of local union officials.
   Suhrheinrich did not say how he would rule on one of the Labor
Department suits, which charges Tucker was illegally fired, or on a
suit brought by Tucker demanding reinstatement and payment of lost
wages and benefits.
   Tucker's attorney, Joseph Yablonski, and the Labor Department
argued that Tucker was fired illegally because the UAW constitution
allows international union staff members to run for union office.
   They also argued that the rule used to fire Tucker, which
requires staff members running for office to take a leave of
absence 90 days before the election, was never properly adopted by
the union's leadership or by the rank-and-file.

   Lee Iacocca's second book, a meditation on
lessons he has learned in business and private life and how they
can be applied to modern problems, will go on sale June 1, his
publisher announced Monday.
   The book, entitled ``Talking Straight,'' was written with New
York Times reporter Sonny Kleinfield. A first printing of at least
500,000 copies is planned, according tom Stuart Applebaum, a
spokesman for Bantam Books.
   Iacocca draws upon his experiences he has had as son, husband,
father, friend and Chrysler Corp. chairman to comment on the
problems of Wall Street, Washington and the world.
   ``He proposes fresh answers to some very tough questions that we
face as individuals and as a nation, perhaps most important among
them, how do we retrieve the values our parents and grandparents
gave us?'' said Linda Grey, president and publisher of Bantam.
   Iacocca's first book, ``Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' has sold
more than 2.6 million copies in hardcover; it was on the New York
Times bestseller list for 80 weeks, 40 of them in first place. It
also has sold more than 3.5 million in paperback, and has been
published in 18 languages.
   He has been working on the new book since October 1986.

<HEAD>London Stock Exchange Chief To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Nicholas Goodison said Monday he is resigning
at the end of the year as chairman of the London Stock Exchange,
which he piloted through its ``Big Bang'' computer revolution in
1986 and the market crash last October.
   Goodison, 53, will take over the chairmanship of the Trustee
Savings Bank next Jan. 1.
   ``I have served on the Stock Exchange council for the past 20
years and been chairman for the past 12. I have been chairman
during a period of great innovation and change and now feel that
the structure for the future has been built,'' Goodison said in a
statement.
   An election among the stock exchange's members for a new
chairman is likely in the fall.
   Goodison in his new post succeeds Sir John Read, who will be 70
on March 29 and due for retirement this year from leadership of the
Trustee Savings Bank, which is a financial services group as well
as a bank with 1.9 million investors.
   Goodison has been chairman of stockbrokers Quilter Goodison Co.
Ltd. since 1975.
   He said the stock crash of last October and November had nothing
to do with his move, and that the old-style exchange could not have
absorbed the wave of selling.
   When he became chairman, Goodison was confronted with the then
Labor government's decision to reconstruct the stock exchange by
separating market-makers and brokers into different partnerships.
   Eleven years later came the Big Bang, on Oct. 27, 1986, ending
fixed commissions and the distinction between brokers who were
agents in the buying and selling of shares and stock-jobbers who
actively traded in shares at prices they quoted to brokers.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell modestly Monday in light
trading as the dollar drifted lower and a key commodity-price index
edged higher.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond fell ] point, or $3.75 for every
$1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 8.51 percent from
8.47 percent late Friday.
   The bellwether issue had plunged $20 per $1,000 in face amount
on Friday, after the government reported unexpectedly high February
employment levels, raising doubts about forecasts of an economic
slowdown later this year.
   David Hale, economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago,
said the report prompted some investment firms to raise their
economic growth forecasts. Faster growth is generally viewed
negatively in the bond market because credit demands increase when
the economy expands, pushing interest rates up.
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis,
said the bond market was also hurt by a new decline in the dollar
and a slight rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index, mainly
due to higher meat prices.
   A falling dollar reduces the yields available to foreign
investors on dollar-denominated investments. It also raises
pressure on domestic producers to keep prices low to compete with
foreign products.
   Meanwhile, interest rates rose from last week on short-term
Treasury securities sold in the government's latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.74 percent, up from 5.62 percent
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 5.93 percent, up from 5.86 percent last
week.
   The rates for three-month bills were the highest since Feb. 1
when they sold for 5.74 percent. Three-month bills sold for 5.85
percent on Jan. 25. The rates for six-month bills were the highest
since Feb. 16 when they averaged 6.03 percent.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, held steady at 6.63 percent
last week, the same as the rate for the previous week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues slipped 2-32 point, intermediate maturities were
down \ point and 20-year issues fell [ point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.17 to 112.97. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, lost 2.29
to 1,181.09.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities fell \ point in
light trading, according to the investment firm of Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, was off 0.64 to 283.78.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 2 basis points to 5.72
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were unchanged at 5.95 percent and one-year bills
rose 3 basis points to 6.30 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6| percent, up from 6{ percent late Friday.

<HEAD>American Standard To Consider Sweetened Black & Decker Buyout
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. said Monday its board of
directors would consider the latest hostile buyout offer from Black
& Decker Corp. and indicated it might sweeten its own alternative
plan a second time.
   Black & Decker, which has been pursuing American Standard since
late January, last Friday sweetened its outstanding tender offer to
$73 a share from $68 for American Standard's 31 million common
shares outstanding, or a total of about $2.26 billion.
   That move came after American Standard, a plumbing and air
conditioning maker, sweetened its defensive recapitalization plan
to $2.3 billion.
   The revised recapitalization announced Friday would pay
shareholders $64 in cash, $5 in securities and one share of stock
in the recapitalized company for each old share. The earlier cash
portion was $59 a share.
   American Standard rose 75 cents to $73.25 a share Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Black & Decker dipped 37{ cents to $18 a
share, a decline stemming partly from an adjustment for a dividend
payment.
   William B. Boyd, American Standard's chairman and chief
executive, said the company's recapitalization plan already was
financially superior to Black & Decker's sweetened tender offer and
advised shareholders not to tender their stock.
   ``In the meantime, stockholders should be aware that, if Black &
Decker increases its offer beyond the values we can achieve for our
stockholders in a recapitalization, we would vigorously pursue
other alternatives in order to enhance stockholder value,'' Boyd
stated.
   He also said American Standard was ``working on ways to further
improve'' its recapitalization plan, but did not elaborate.
   Black & Decker, a Towson, Md.-based maker of tools and
appliances, also has indicated it would attempt to win shareholder
support for taking control of American Standard's board of
directors.

   Loss-plagued Lorimar-Telepictures
Corp., which was formed two years ago by a merger but has seen its
aggressive expansion plans disintegrate, said Monday it is
discussing the possibility of being acquired by Warner
Communications Inc.
   Word of the negotiations helped push Lorimar's stock price up
$2.50 a share to $15. In the past year, the stock has traded as
high as $25.25 and as low as $6.62{.
   ``I'd say the odds (of a takeover) are 50-50,'' said Harold
Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York.
   He estimated the final price of a deal would be ``somewhere
between $14 and the high teens.''
   Lorimar has about 45.9 million shares outstanding.
   In a brief statement, Lorimar, a leading supplier of original
television programming, said it was approached by New York-based
Warner and preliminary talks were under way ``to explore the
desirability of a business combination.''
   However, Lorimar said its board has made no decision as to
whether such a deal would be in the best interests of shareholders.
   The company also noted it has been approached about possible
mergers in the past and nothing came of those overtures.
   The Culver City-based company was formed in February 1986 by the
stock-swap combination of Lorimar Inc., best known as the producer
of such long-running television series as ``Dallas'' and ``Knots
Landing,'' and New York-based Telepictures Corp., which got most of
its revenue from animated shows such as ``Thundercats'' and such
programs as ``Peoples Court'' and ``Love Connection.''
   For the 1987-88 television season, the company is producing 12
hours of prime time and 16{ hours of syndicated shows, including
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' ``Mama's Family,'' ``It's a
Living'' and ``She's the Sheriff.''
   For the first nine months of of its current fiscal year, Lorimar
posted a loss of $82.6 million on revenues of $616.8 million. The
deficit included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22
million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video
unit.
   Management of both its movie and home-video units was recently
ousted.
   For fiscal 1987 ended last March 31, the company lost $58.6
million, mostly because of restructuring costs, on revenues of
$766.2 million.
   In recent years, Lorimar sought to expand far beyond its
successful roots as a producer of television shows.
   It bought advertising agencies, sought to build a network of
television stations and acquired a children's publishing unit, but
it has shed most of those operations in a back-to-basics
restructuring announced last June.
   The company has just completed the sale of the ad agencies _
Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt Inc. and Poppe Tyson Inc. _ to
members of their management for about $100 million, posting a
pre-tax profit of $16 million.
   In late 1986, Lorimar had agreed to buy seven big-city Storer
and Wometco television stations from Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts for
$1.85 billion. The move would have given Lorimar 12 stations around
the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.
   However, the deal with Kohlberg collapsed as the bottom fell out
of the market for television stations, and the company has sold
some of the stations it already owned and is seeking buyers for the
remainder.
   The company also sold its children's publishing unit.
   Warner is the parent of Warner Bros. studio, is a leading record
producer and is a major cable television operator.
   Warner's financial results have been strong.
   In 1987, its profit rose 77 percent to $328.1 million, or $2.09
a share, from $185.8 million, of $1.26 a share, the previous year.
   The 1987 figures included a net gain of $37.3 million on the
sale of investments while the 1986 results included a gain of $48.4
million from the sale of investments and a gain from discontinued
operations.
   Revenue for 1987 rose 20 percent to $3.4 billion from $2.84
billion.
   Its Warner Bros. film unit had the best year in its history,
with an operating profit of $176.4 million, compared to $172.2
million in 1986.
   Warner's music operation posted a 1987 operating profit of
$213.9 million, up from $150.6 million, and operating profit from
the cable and broadcasting division jumped to $46.1 million for the
year from $16.2 million in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Although sales for the A.H. Robins Co.
jumped 11 percent for the final three months of 1987, the
pharmaceutical company reported a net loss of $1.69 billion for the
period because of costs related to its Dalkon Shield birth-control
device.
   Robins said its loss in the period compared to a profit of $26.2
million, or $1.08 a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $234.8 million from $210.8 million a year earlier.
   For all of 1987, Robins suffered a loss of $1.63 billion
compared to a profit of $81.8 million, or $3.38 a share, in 1986.
Revenue for the year rose to $855.8 million from $789.9 million.
   Robins was forced to set aside $1.75 billion last year to help
cover the costs of claims concerning women who were injured by the
Dalkon Shield, which has been discontinued.
   The accrual represents the difference between the $2.30 billion
provided in the company's fifth amended reorganization plan and the
$548 million which remained from the reserve for Dalkon Shield
claims established by the company in 1984.
   Robins' results were also hurt by the costs of its Chapter 11
reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
   E. Claiborne Robins Jr., the president and chief executive, said
consumer products in the U.S., international operations and medical
instruments were the principal contributors to the higher sales for
the year.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Ask Airline To Agree To Arbitration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters union asked Northwest Airlines on
Monday to submit issues separating the company and its 6,500 flight
attendants to binding arbitration.
   Northwest Airlines said it would not agree to arbitration but
was willing to resume talks.
   William Genoese, director of the Teamsters airline division,
said flight attendants were prepared to strike if the airline did
not agree to arbitration in 72 hours.
   Gov. James Blanchard's administration backed the arbitration
request, said state Labor Director Betty Howe, who joined Genoese
in a news conference at a Teamsters office in Detroit.
   The flight attendants, more than 2,000 of them based in Detroit,
have worked since a Feb. 26 strike deadline, but no talks have been
held for the past week.
   Genoese cited economic and safety concerns as reasons for
holding off on a strike this long.
   He referred to a Federal Aviation Administration report Friday
on safety concerns at Northwest Airlines and said a strike would
mean operating with less experienced replacement flight attendants.
``This would threaten both the comfort and safety of Northwest
passengers,'' he said.
   Issues dividing the two sides include a two-tier wage system
under which attendants hired after May 1984 must work five years to
earn the same as those hired earlier. The airline proposes to
extend the time to nine years.
   Howe, ``without commenting on the merits of either side,'' said
the Blanchard administration is concerned about the Detroit-based
flight attendants' jobs and the potential economic impact of a
strike.
   Northwest Airlines accounts for about half the air traffic in
and out of Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the largest of its three
hubs. The airline operates about 248 flights a day at Metro, about
227 at Minneapolis, where it is headquartered, and 201 at its
Memphis, Tenn., hub.

   The federal government and rocket maker Morton
Thiokol Inc. paid $7,735,000 in cash and annuities and divided the
cost 40-60 to settle all claims by the families of four of the
astronauts who died in the Challenger explosion.
   Documents released Monday showed that Morton Thiokol, which
produced the faulty booster rocket blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion, paid $4,641,000. The government's share of the
settlements was $3,094,000.
   A lawyer who represented other family members called the
settlements ``woefully inadequate.''
   The surviving four spouses and six children actually will
receive more than $7.7 million. This is because each was given an
annuity, which pays benefits larger than its cost but over a period
of many years.
   The total dollar amount the families will receive over time and
the breakdown by family were not released.
   With the release of the documents, the Justice Department
settled a civil suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act
by The Associated Press and six other news organizations. The
government originally had kept details of the settlements and
negotiations secret, saying it needed to keep its internal
deliberations confidential and that the company and families
demanded secrecy.
   The documents, with some deletions to preserve family privacy,
included the final settlement agreements with the families and the
company, some correspondence between the government and the
company, and several Justice Department statements concerning the
negotiations.
   The settlements were reached Dec. 29, 1986, with the immediate
survivors of spacecraft commander Dick Scobee, 46, a retired Air
Force officer employed by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration; mission specialist Ellison S. Onizuka, 39, an Air
Force lieutenant colonel; payload specialist Gregory Jarvis, 41, an
employee of Hughes Aircraft Co.; and Christa McAuliffe, 37, a
Concord, N.H., public high school teacher.
   Scobee is survived by his wife, June, and two adult children;
Onizuka left his wife, Lorna, and two minor children; Jarvis left
his wife, Marcia; and McAuliffe left her husband, Steven, and two
minor children.
   Among the disclosures:
   _The four families had no lawyers during the negotiations. They
relied instead on informal advice from Leo B. Lind Jr., the law
partner of McAuliffe's husband and executor of her estate.
   _The Justice Department did all the negotiating for Morton
Thiokol as well as the government. Lind said in an affidavit that
the families never spoke to company officials.
   _The rocket maker and its insurers twice tried to have the
settlements cover any property damage Morton Thiokol might have
caused, such as destruction of the orbiter and payload. The
government refused, and those claims are still in negotiation.
   _Although the Justice Department claims it cannot legally be
sued by the families of military or federal civilian employees who
die on duty, it contributed 40 percent to each of the settlements.
Only the Jarvis and McAuliffe relatives had a right to sue the
government; all the astronaut families could sue the company.
   _Even Morton Thiokol's attorneys said the government was being
unfair to the divorced parents of mission specialist Judith A.
Resnik, 36, a civilian NASA employee. ``My negotiations on behalf
of Morton Thiokol have been constrained by the government's refusal
to participate to any degree at all'' in a settlement the company
considered acceptable, company attorney John W. Adler wrote Justice
last July.
   Michael D. Oldak, Resnik's ex-husband, represented her father,
Marvin, and last month reached a settlement with the company to
which the government did not contribute.
   Asked about the document release, Oldak said Monday, ``It
confirmed our suspicion that the government had made a contribution
to people in Judy's situation, that is, government employees, and
that we were being treated unfairly.''
   Marvin Resnik said that settlement was ``commensurate with what
some of the others got _ from $2 million to $3.5 million.''
   In January, Resnik's mother, Sarah Resnik Belfer, and Jarvis'
father, Bruce, settled with Morton Thiokol but the government did
not contribute.
   Last May, the company settled a suit by Cheryl McNair, wife of
mission specialist Ronald E. McNair, 35, a civilian NASA employee
who also left two infant children.
   Ronald Krist, the Houston lawyer who represented Bruce Jarvis,
Sarah Belfer and the McNairs, said he would not have allowed his
clients to accept such a ``woefully inadequate'' settlement as the
four did.
   ``They would have netted more money if they had been adequately
represented,'' Krist said, even taking attorneys fees into account.
   Betty Grissom, whose husband Gus was killed in the Apollo One
fire on the launch pad in 1967, said she was treated unjustly when
it came to settlement of her claim against North American Rockwell.
``It kind of hurts .... It hurts when I think that they're getting
that much money,'' she said. She and her two children received
$350,000.
   Jane Smith, wife of pilot Michael J. Smith, 40, a Navy
commander, has a suit pending in federal court against the company.
The government last month was dismissed as a defendant, because
military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful death.
   A presidential commission said the explosion occurred when hot
gas leaked through a joint in a booster rocket built by Thiokol and
ignited the main fuel tank.
   A separate agreement between the government and Morton Thiokol
asserted that disposal of the four claims in no way ``abrogates any
claim of any nature which the United States may have against MTI
for property damage associated with the Challenger accident,
including but not limited to any claims for the loss of the orbiter
itself,'' the document said. The replacement orbiter now under
construction is expected to cost $3 billion.
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said Monday that negotiations are
continuing between NASA and Thiokol lawyers on the type and amount
of penalties that will be imposed on the Utah rocket-maker's
contract with the government.
   A NASA statement in February 1987 said Thiokol would forfeit $10
million in profit and receive no profit from $409 million worth of
redesign work. But Garrett said that does not end the matter.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement Ends Threat of Strike at Key Stamping Plant</HEAD>

   A tentative settlement reached early Monday
between the United Auto Workers union and Chrysler Corp., derailing
the threat of a strike at a key Sterling Heights stamping plant.
   ``Obviously, the company is hopeful that the workers will ratify
the agreement and that the threat of a strike will disappear,''
Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard said.
   Sterling Heights makes metal hoods and trunk lids for all
domestically made Chrysler cars and most trucks and makes fuel
tanks for all Chrysler cars except one.
   A strike there would soon have hurt all Chrysler production, and
additional strikes at a few other key plants could have crippled
Chrysler within days.
   UAW Vice President Marc Stepp had joined negotiations between
Chrysler and UAW Local 1264 on Friday, a day after Chrysler
announced it would not sell its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   The union would have been the first to receive Stepp's
permission to strike over local issues such as health-and-safety
grievances and violation of work rules.
   Stepp had promised to give immediate strike authorization to all
locals with legitimate grievances. But after Chrysler decided to
keep its 28,000-worker Acustar subsidiary, he began moving to
resolve local disputes.
   Stepp and other negotiators bargained through the weekend and
reached a tentative settlement on Local 1264's grievances at 5 a.m.
Monday, the union said. Stepp was unavailable for comment Monday.
   The union said it was withholding details of the agreement until
March 11, when the local's 3,600 active and 500 laid-off members
will vote on the settlement.
   ``We saved a lot of jobs and got additional jobs,'' said Fred
O'Brien, Local 1264 recording secretary and a member of the local's
bargaining committee.
   O'Brien said Chrysler agreed to add workers to clean up oil that
leaks from the plants massive presses onto the shop floor and to
clean and repair the machines as a matter of routine.
   Workers had complained that because the presses are run around
the clock, they don't receive adequate maintenance, particularly
cleaning, and the machines and the floors around them are covered
with oil and dirt.
   Local 1264 had accumulated nearly 140 unresolved grievances
since last year. Other locals had been gathering grievances so they
could be ready to strike if Chrysler had decided to sell Acustar.

<HEAD>Homestake Turns Down Pickens Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homestake Mining Co. rejected as inadequate
an unsolicited $1.88 billion buyout offer from the partnership led
by T. boone Pickens on Monday and said it wished to remain
independent.
   The board of directors of Homestake, the nation's biggest gold
producer, unanimously rejected the $20 a share buyout offer made
last month by Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership.
   Homestake stock closed at $17.12{ a share Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange, unchanged from Friday's close.
   Pickens had labeled the buyout offer a friendly bid and proposed
a negotiated transaction with Homestake's managers.
   But Homestake's board concluded the offer was inadequate and not
in the best interests of the stockholders, said company officials.
   ``In light of our business prospects, we are better off served
as an independent company, said Stephanie Kushner, Homestake's
manager of financial services. ``We are trying to focus on the
financial future of the company.''
   ``We're really in a strong position right now with significant
cash assets and a very strong balance sheet, and our management is
in a better position to put that money to work for the company,''
Kushner stated.
   Homestake, one of the largest gold producers in the western
world outside of South Africa, owns the Homestake gold mine in
South Dakota and the McLaughlin mine in Northern California. The
company also has a one-quarter interest in the Round Mountain mine
in Nevada.
   In addition, Homestake owns a 42.5 percent interest in The Doe
Run Co., the largest U.S. producer of lead products, and a 48
percent interest in two mines in Western Australia.
   Kushner noted Pickens had not made a tender offer to Homestake
shareholders, and she was unsure whether he would now pursue a
hostile takeover in light of the board's rejection.
   The offer was Pickens' second move on a gold-mining company in
six months. His $2 billion takeover attempt for New York-based
Newmont Mining Corp. was blocked when Newmont's biggest
shareholder, Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, acquired a controlling
stake in the company to help thwart the hostile bid.

   Striking scriptwriters warned that their
walkout would send TV soap operas, talk shows and variety programs
into reruns, but producers said Monday they have stockpiled enough
scripts to ride out a long strike.
   Movie and television scriptwriters left their typewriters and
joined nearly 2,000 colleagues on a picket line at 20th Century Fox
studios in a contract dispute over the issues of residuals and
creative control.
   Carrying placards reading ``The Writers Guild Strikes,'' pickets
five-abreast snaked in front of the Fox studios in West Los Angeles.
   ``Hollywood has treated writers like bean-field workers for
years,'' said screenwriter and science fiction author Harlan
Ellison. ``It begins with the dream. Without the dream on paper,
there is nothing.''
   The Writers Guild of America rejected Sunday's final offer by
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and a
strike was ordered for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. Six hundred news
writers were exempt.
   ``We feel all the issues were dealt with fairly. They went on
strike on issues we felt were resolved,'' alliance spokesman Herb
Steinberg said, adding producers were ``ready to write a check for
$550 million'' for a new three-year contract. The alliance
represents about 200 producers and studios.
   The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service scheduled a
meeting for both sides Tuesday.
   Issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage of
foreign market distribution residuals, and an offer by producers to
scale back syndication residuals for one-hour television shows.
   Producers claim new shows made for independent stations have
dried up the rerun syndication market. Their offer includes an
increase to 150 percent of current residual agreements if the show
does well in syndication.
   Writers claim the offer is not equitable with a similar deal
given the Directors Guild last summer.
   Actress Patty Duke, president of the Screen Actors Guild, also
showed up on the picket line to show solidarity with the writers,
but the actors contract prohibits secondary walkouts.
   The union said talk shows, game shows and soap operas would
quickly reflect the strike's impact, but producers said scripts had
been stockpiled and that many prime-time shows had completed
shooting for the season.
   ``Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs
relying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and the
soaps will see a difference right away,'' guild spokeswoman Cheryl
Rhoden said.
   A three-month strike delayed the fall television season in 1981.
   ``It's business as usual. We're prepared,'' CBS spokeswoman
Janet Storm said. The network produces the soaps ``Guiding Light,''
``As the World Turns,'' ``The Bold And The Beautiful'' and ``The
Young And The Restless.''
   NBC spokesman Dom Giofre said the network's ``Another World,''
``Days Of Our Lives'' and ``Santa Barbara,'' wouldn't be affected
soon because there were scripts already written for another month.
   The strike won't immediately effect NBC's ``Late Night With
David Letterman'' and ``Saturday Night Live,'' which were already
on scheduled breaks. ``The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson''
featured guest host Jay Leno on Monday, as scheduled. But the
comedian used material prepared before the strike, Giofre said.
   On daily production shows such as soap operas, writers normally
turn out scripts near shooting schedule deadlines. Shows like
``Late Night With David Letterman'' are known for ad-lib lines, but
much of the monologue and skits are created by a writing staff.
Since much of the material is topical, it often is written within
minutes of showtime.
   Picket captain Stanley Ralph Ross said selection of Fox ``was
fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and location had a lot to do
with it. ``We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking
around here.''
   The guild's contract expired at midnight Feb. 29.
   Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some
one-hour shows syndicated in the United States and said they
couldn't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets.
   Steinberg claimed foreign residual payments have increased 84.6
percent since 1972, which was the last time writers negotiated that
issue. Writers receive a single lump sum that varies depending on
what is negotiated between the writer and producer.
   ``When the business is good, they are going to share it,''
Steinberg said. ``But while we're making money in foreign, we're
still losing money in domestic, and that foreign distribution money
has to cover those losses.''
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000 a year, but
about half of the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time,
Ms. Rhoden said.

   Central Bank President Fernando Milliet
resigned Monday and the government fired the president of the
semi-official Banco do Brasil, Camilo Calazans, officials said.
   No immediate explanation was given for the dismissals.
   Milliet, the fourth Central Bank President under Brazil's
3-year-old civilian regime, was in charge of negotiating the
refinancing of Brazil's huge $113 billion foreign debt.
   Milliet was to be replaced by Elmo de Araujo Camoes, an
experienced banker with the Banco do Brasil, the Sao Paulo State
Bank Banespa and the Sogeral bank. He is a member of the
government's national monetary council.
   Calazans, an economist who used to head the government's coffee
agency, reportedly disagreed with Finance Minister Mailson da
Nobrega about wage restrictions for federal employees. Da Nobrega
favored a wage freeze to reduce the federal deficit, but Calazans
nevertheless granted a raise for Banco do Brasil employees.
   Calazans was to be replaced by Mario Gusmao Berard, the
secretary-general of the finance ministery and closely tied to da
Nobrega.
